\N0TS.3 ON THE jySRMEWE COURT Oii1 INTEHLhTIOMX^by Mr. Balfour.I informed rny colleagues this morning that I had nowritten statement on the subject o.j the Permanent Court to convey to them on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government, and thatany views I desired to communicate I w^.uld communicate attorno;.row&apos;s session.   aut the following brief observations may of be/use to them, though I hope they will not treat them as more than indications of the general trend of opinion which, I think prevails in the British Cabinet,The British Cabinet fully recognise the importance of providing a Permanent Tribunal, without delay.   The duty has been formally thrown upon the League of Nations by the pact and unquetitionally the Council of the -ueague will find it difficult or impossible, to carry out all the functions entrusted to it without the assistance of some such Body, At the same time, there are obvious difficulties in accepting the scheme proposed by the Jurists without modifications of some importance.The first observation I have to make is that the scheme, with all its many merits, goes considerably beyond the Covenant.   Article 14 (by vh ich the Council is directed to formulate and submit to the League the plans of the Permanent Court) clearly contemplates (a) that the Court has only to deal with disputes which are voluntarily submitted to it by the authorities concerned; and (b) that it has to give an advisory ojinion on any dispute or question which the council or
or iisae/nbly may choose to submit to it.   Evidently, the fracers of the article never intended that one party to a dispute should compel another party to go before the Tribunal; and this omission cannot have been a matter of choice, since the subject of compulsory arbitration has been before the legal authorities of the whole world now for many years.    It has more than once been brought up tor practical decision, and has always been rejected.There are two eases, however, which font a real or apparent exception to this; - one concerned with the protection of minorities, and the other concerned with the problems of Labour.   On both these subjects the Covenant contemplates that when a case has properly been brought before the Permanent Court by any Member of the League, the Court is Method   with full jurisdiction, whether the other party like it or&apos;not.   And on this - the compulsory side of the duties of the Permanent Court - I have only to observe that the machinery for carrying out these difficult and onerous duties does not appear to have boon clearly worked out.   As regards certain Labour puestions, for example, which may arise under article 418 of the Treaty of Versailles,  the Permanent Court has the right, and therefore the duty, of suggesting what punishment of an economic order they thin&amp; the Governments concerned should impose on an offending country.   This is a tremendous responsibility and may produce incalculable consequences; and it is worth considering whether the Court, which exercises it, ought not to be strengthened in uich cases by expert assessors. For this ^here is no provision made in the draft scheme.The re
There 1b another point on which I speak with much dilfiAenee.. It 3eems to me that the decision of the Permanent Court cannot but have the effect of gradually moulding and modifying inter-national law.   This may be good or bad: but I do not think this was contemplated by the Pact:   and in any case, there ought u be some prevision bj which a state can enter a protest, not against any particular decision arrived at by the Court., but against any ulterior conclusions to which that decision mray seem to point.If this danger has any reality, it becomes doubly formidable from the fact that at present the three most pop-ulous Western states -r the United states, Germany and Russia -are not members of the League, and cainot be expected to take their views on international law from the Court&apos;s decision. This, it will be observed, is an additional reason f?r keeping the duties of the Court as rigidly as possible within the limits suggested by Irticle 14 of the Covenant, to which reference has already been made.There are two other points of a much simpler character to which I should like to call attention.The scheme of the Jurists apparently contemplates that the Court should have retrospective powers, - in other words, should be able to deal with oases which arose before the League of Nations came into existence.   To this I feel sure, my Government would have the strongest objeotion.^gain, the second contemplates that French should be the only language of the tribunal.   I do not think that this, cuite apart from the merits of the case, could be accepted until America joined&apos; the League, and had an opportunity of officially expressing her opinion on thesubject.
subject.   4.part from American pinion, it has to bo-observed that the Treaty of Versailles puU the two languages on an equality; and, that in every instrumoi t issuing out of the Treaty of Versailles this equality is m - .JUU ined.     The League of nations itself carries on its bu.. loss in French and English; and the English is not regards .  S a mere translation of the French, but is treated a * of equal authority. It would seem unfortunate to make an Qxoeitj.cn i&amp; respect of tho Permanent Court; and I have no doubt th; t my U^vernment would regard any such exception with the gr eteet. disfavour.It will be observed thit X have limite my observations to points of importance, and, in particular ..ave altogether omitted any criticism of drafting,. But what   have said is, I hope, sufficient to she v. that ve must pioce ?d cautiously in this matter, and that.while any unnecessar .rilay in bringing the lermanent Court into existence wj Id be most unfortunate, the powers conferred upon it - at in theearly years of its existence - should not go b *; ond wlN&amp;t I take to have been the intention of the state sis i who i&apos; rstoed the Covenant,A.J.B.Hi IrOctober 20th, 1920,,.
