In this chapter are shewn tho payments to be made in view of the purchase, of the Hotel National in Geneva, of the purchase of necessary furniture, and library books, and finally, of the proposed installation of a printing office in the basement of the Palais des Nations,)The direct expenditure of the Secretariat, notwithstanding certain necessary increases on account of the continual development.and the growing importance of the work of the
Secretariat; amounts for tho year 1921 to a total wall below double the amount estimated for the last six months of 1920 o This satisfactory result is duo in part to the fact that all the activities of the league v/ill be cent *allsod at its Seat, and that, consequently, travelling expenses will bo materially reduced.Similarly, notwithstanding the addition of a certain number of new items in the chapter of Indirect Expenditure, the total appropriations asked for by the Secretary-General for 1921 do not amount to double the sum estimated for the last six months of 192f.   The moat important of those new&apos;items is that which -provides the sum of 1,500,000 Francs for the Permanent Court of International Justice, should the Assembly approve of its establishment.      On the other hand, no estimate has been made in the Third Budget for the expenses which might he incurred by certain advances made to the Administrative Commissions, since the necessary funds can be advanced from the working capital, a.nd sre reimbursable.In order that the League may always have at its disposal sufficient funds to carry on its work, it has been thought essential to provide the sum of 2^350,000 Gold Francs for the establishment ef working capital or reserve.    It Is to be expected that the larger share of the appropriation of 1,725,000 Gold Francs estimated in the Second Budget for the same purpose will be absorbed by the immediate transfer and the establishment of the Secretariat at its permanent Seat-. These, expenses could not have been provided for at the timo of the preparation of the Second Budget.   The creation of this working capital reserve has -been judged Indispensable, owing to the delays which frequently take place en the voting of credits by the Parliaments, and the fact that certain Members of the ^eague for this reason find It sometimes Impossible to pay their contributions ;-s soon as they &quot;become due *
The Budget of the International Labour Offloe has beenprepared rather hurriedly, end its Director informs us that he will not be able to furnish us with detailed estimates until January, after the next Meeting of the Governing Body.   It seems, however, unlikely that the total estimates which amount to 7,000,000 Francs, will be changed.   This sum amounts to one third of the expenses incurred for the various Organisations 6  the League of Rations - i.a*, Secretariat, Conferences, International Labour Office, etooAs I have already stated at San Sebastian, according to -the Covenant, it does not rest with the Council of the League of Nations to discuss this amount.   We can oily accept the request of the Governing Body of the&apos; International Labour Office, and enter in our Budget the sum of 7,COO,000 Gold Francs,It would seem advisable to obtain the sanction of the Council as to some new schema for apportioning the contributions of the Members of the League between the League and the INTERNATIONAL onal Labour Office,   Heretofore, the Secretariat has promised to advance to the International Labour Office the amount of its Budget by semi-monthly payments.   Since the Members, on account of the delays necessary to obtain votes of credit in their various Parliaments, do n ot always pay their contributions Kh.cn they are requested to do so, up to the present 50 per cent of all the sums received by the Financial Administration of the Learue of Nations has been handedover&apos;to the International Labour Office.   This scheme has already placed the other services of the League of Nations in a very difficult position^   I venture therefore,to propose - if you agree - that we should hand over to the International Labour Office a proportion of e ach contribution received equal to the proportion between the Budget of the International Labour Office and that of the League of Nations.   These payments would be made according as the contributions in regard of the 1921 fiscal period are
received.   Next year, for i nstance, since the Budget of the International Labour Office amounts to half the expend!euro of all the other services of the League of Nations.- that is to say -to a third of the total Budgetary estimates - one third of each contribution received by the League would be immediately transmitted to the Dirocto 1 of the International Labour Office *The estimates which are submitted for your approval have been prepared with care, and are based on information at present- in our possession.   They are, however, only provisional, and during the Assembly, certain changes will probably have to be made, in order that tho Budget, onoe it has been finally ratified; may contain such appropriations as may be necessary to earn;- out the decisions of the Assembly, , ,It is unlikely that the Budget can be reducedj on the con-trary, it is quite likely that it will have to be increased.   The amount estimated for the International Financial Organisations, for example, is a minimum sum, and should it be decided, as M.-, Ador in his last speech seemed to indicate that another Financial Conference $should be held next year^ this partloular appropriation would have to be increased.The approaching transfer of the Secretariat to its permanent Seat raises a question relating to the manner in which the Salaries shall be paid at Geneva.   In view of the decisions of the Council, it seems advisable to pay them in Gold Francs, but it still re-mains to determine the ratio between the Pound and the Gold Franc. This question the Council is now called upon to solvev   The Memorandum of the Secretary-General (Council Document No.79) explains the question with all necessary details.   I entirely accept the solution which is proposed in this Memorandum.   The salaries of the members cf the Secretariat must now be fixed, but it would be hardly fair for their salaries to be reduced by the present abnormal depreciation of the Pound sterlings   The Pound sterling at the time when the Principal members of the Secretariat were appointed, was the equivalent of 24 Swiss francs,
It is, therefore, reasonable that tho members of the Secretariat should receive an amount in Gold Francs which would to-day be the equivalent of 24 Swiss Francs, since it would not be just that they should suffer a diminution of salary on account of the fact that the Secretariat was not established at its permanent Seat last year as they expected.   No one will feel that he is being unfairly treated if you decide to fix this ratio at 20 Gold Francs to the Pound, since 20 Gold Francs represent to-day about 24 Swiss Francs0I, therefore, submit for your approval the following Resolutions:-(1)   The Ccur.oi.1 cf the League of Nations approves the Budget presented by the Secretary General for the third fiscal period which covers the calendar year 1921o(2)   When receiving the.,coritributions of the Members of ti League of Nations in respect of the 1921 Badge&apos;;-, the Secretary General is authorised to pay the sums mentioned in A,r:: 399 of the Treaty of Versailles, by handing over to the Inter -national Labour Office a proportion of each contribution re-ceived equal to the proportion between the Budget of the Inter-national Labour Office and that of the other services of the League of NationsQ(3)   The Council authorises the Secretary General, beginn. on November 1st * to convert the salaries of the members of the Secretariat at the ratio cf 23 Gold Francs to -the Pound.-,2, Whitehall Gardens, S0W*1,, 2nd November. 19200
