COPY OP L3TTFR FROM THE Mil? 18ERR OF TRANSPORT TO THE MINISTER OF LABOIH.6, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 8th November, 1920.My dear Macnamara,There is - as you are of course aware - trouble brewing in the Electrical Generating Industry.   Thtf Super-visory Unions - and 1,500 men are involved - have given notice to terminate their employment on the 28th of this month.   For the present at any rate, as I understand it, they have agreed with the Craft Union - which involves 7,000 men - to act with them, although the Craft Union have net so far tendered notices.   These 8,500 men, however, mean a complete cessation of all bulk power production in the country.The difficulty appears to arise because the employers as a whole * and there are about 270 undertakings in-volved - have not taken the Supervisory Union sufficient-ly seriously.   It comprises men up to  1,000 a year, and covers the whole of the Supervisory Grades up the Chief Engineer in the industry.The dispute arises as a sequence to what is known as the &quot;Stoker Award&quot;.   This was a temporary award given some time ago to carry over a difficult period.   Then a new Supervisory Staff Whitley Council met and drew up a Schedule.   Of the 270 employers, seme 70 - Including all the large Companies - have accepted the Schedule, but 290 undertakers decline to accept the Schedule, throw over their representatives on the Whiiley Council, and in the case of Corporations, wish to adopt the line that they will, deal with their Supervisors in the Electric Power Stations as municipal employees, just as they deal
with their scavengers or any-other municipal employees. The clangor involved in a strike of these Supervisors -backed an they will be in this case, at any rate, by the 7,000 Graft Unionists - is a very serious matter, and to carry on the Generating Stations of the country without the Supervisors is a more difficult task than it was to carry on without the lower grade Craft Unions.   In this case we have -io contemplate carrying on with both Unions out.The matter, is of course primarily - so far as negtaia-tion is concerned - for your Department, and has nothing to do with me, but I am interested in it because of the organ-is ation which must ho called Into being - after creation in this case - to deal with the supply of power, if the crisis should materialise, and we have only three weeks in which to deal with the situation.I am told that a possible line would be to refer the matter - not for arbitration - but for consideration and report to an-Industrial Court.   If the Court were asked to arbitrate, that would sound the death knell of the Whitley Council organisation in this and other industries, as I am advised, but experience has shown us that a Court which ascertains the facts and publishes a fair and impartial statement after enquiry has a great moral effect upon the hotheads in disputes of this kind - be they masters or men. I cannot think that the Corporations w**uld he supported in an unreasonahle refusal - If they are unreasonable -ta acknowledge ar.d accept the report of the Whitley Council, upon which their nominees were sitting, even though they now say that those nominees exceeded their powers in coming to the conclusions which they reached.I should he glad if you would kindly sec Mr, page, whs is of course interested and concerned in the matter,
