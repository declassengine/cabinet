This document is the property of His Britannic Majestys Government.SECRET.44&apos; THE CABINET.PUBLICATION OF THE JUTLAND DOCUMENTS.MEMORANDUM  BY THE  SECRETARY  OF STATE  FOR WAR.I hope the Cabinet may have an opportunity of discussing the question of the publication of the papers relating to Jutland. There is a great deal of feeling on this subject, and harm is being done by the suppression of the facts. The longer they are suppressed, the more daring will be the strictures of Lord Jellicoe&apos;s critics. The sort of charges which are being published in the Northcliffe Press, and in other newpapers, are of the most insulting kind affecting the military conduct of this officer, and it is obvious that larger and stronger doses will be administered until full publicity has been achieved.Mr. McKenna, on the other hand, said to me in conversation the other day that he had been left in charge of Lord Jellicoe&apos;s interests in this matter, and that the suggestion that the Admiralty were trying to shield Lord Jellicoe and that Lord Jellicoe objected to the publication was altogether untrue. He said that Lord Jellicoe was perfectly agreeable to the publication of the Harper Report and had said so in writing, but that the Admiralty wished to introduce a number of amendments, including the alteration of a diagram, and that Lord Jellicoe&apos;s contention had been that the report should be published as it stood. All these statements were contrary to the impressions I had formed. I gathered that he would feel it his duty in certain circumstances to make a public statement on the subject.I certainly was under the impression that the Harper Report had been promised to Parliament, and I should not have thought it was possible to withhold it from Parliament, or still less to publish it in an altered form. On the other hand, it may well be that the Harper Report does not represent the facts as known to the Admiralty. If such is the case there would surely be no difficulty in publishing the report as it stands with a commentary by the Admiralty upon it. It is certainly very unsatisfactory that Lord Jellicoe&apos;s friends should be stating that he does not fear the publication, and that it is most unfair to suggest that he is objecting to it, while at the same time the Government is reproached with trying to shield a commander by withholding the facts.I am sure that Sir Julian corbetts decision in these matters will not be accepted as authoritative.Generally speaking, surely it is much better to let the true facts about the war come out. That is certainly in the interests of the present administration both of the Admiralty and the War Office, which have nothing to fear from any disclosure, however complete; and it is also, I venture to think, in the interests of the Government as a whole.. &apos; W. S. C.The War Office, 2nd November, 1920.(1320/442)   100  11/20  h&amp;s ltd 8675wo
