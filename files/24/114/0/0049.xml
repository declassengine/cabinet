k ..IS THB PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;3 GO V1LRNMENT.) 2 1.9C R S T.Copy No.CABINET.P. 2049 .DECONTROL OP SUGAR.Memorandum by the Chairman, Royal.Commission on tho(Reference, CP, 2033).. * * * *I have received from the Office of the Cabinet a cop  of the Memorandum by the ^ocd Controller nn the above subject.I have not been asked for observations upon it:   but intone and substance the paper is eo surprising that, on behalf ofthe Commission, I beg to submit a few remarks upon it - making them as brief aa possible!i) Paragraph 2.-(a) The Commission is not aware of any estimate of &quot;production for the year 1920/21&quot;, made by any of the recognised authorities in such matters.(b) There is no necessary relation between the per-centapte reduction in crops and the percentage rise in price - Into the latter many other factors enter, notably the rate of duty, (which in 1914 was l/lOd. per owt., and is now 25/80V)(ii) Paragraph..3*-(a) The Commission believes that it could easily establish a much higher claim than the Pood Controller allows in respect of its operations - But it would unduly extend these notes.(b) . The Commission is unable to identify the *large body of commercial opinion&quot; which is said to be constantly criticising the operations of the Govem-ment in the matter of control, in so far as such &apos; control is exercised through the Sugar Commission.-Beyond the eccentricities of a certain Mr, Cairns, and the dissatisfaction of a certain section of producers (but by no means all), no serious criticisms have reached the Commission itself - On the other hand I may quote a remark in a recent letter which I haye heen shown in confidence from, the man who is the largest controller of sugar in the Cuban market -   He writes &quot;I hope that sugar will be decontrolled in the &quot;United Kingdom,     I say &quot;I hope&quot;, because from the &quot;standpoint of a -producer it would be an advantage; &quot;but from the standpoint of the British Government I &quot;don&apos;t think it is good policy, as it will increase &quot;the number nf buyers and create the consequent; &quot;competition amongst them&quot;. -It is wholly misleading to say that the Commission recommends its own continuance &quot;in the interests of &quot;the British Refiners&quot; - The one essential motive actuating the Commission is to make sure that &quot;the Sugar Supply of the Country oan be adequately maintain-ed, and without interruption&quot; (See my Memorandum paragraph 2 (a) ).   It^is true that this cannot be done without assistance, for a time., to the British(iii) Paragraph
Refiners, and so far their interests will he8erred - But that is not the motive of our proposal.Paragraph 6.&quot;Considerable public critictfjn&quot; of itself seems hardly sufficient ground for abolishing a Department of Ciovernment and in this particular case most of the criticism has beer, neither well informed nor disinterested.Paragraph 7*It is difficult to picture the form which &quot;direct financial assistance cn the part of the Treasury&quot; could take without exposing the Exchequer to large and undefined liability.Paragraph 9, *&apos;Ahe Act of 1916 creating the Office of Food Controller gave him power&apos; at any tine to transfer to himself, in whole or in part, the powers and duties cf any department dealing with Posd.     The question of exercising this right in respect of the Sugar Commission has been considered by almost every holder of the Office of $ood Controller and by more than ono Connit tee of Inquiry, but/on each occasion resulted in the decision to makre no change -It would surely be a strange proceeding at this last moment tc transfer tt the Ministry of Foad the most difficult and most technical cf the Commission&apos;s duties, with the lose of all the expert advisers who have conducted the business for more than 6 years -The purchasing record of the Ministry is not itself so free from criticism that public approval of the change would be assured.H.      PRIMROSE(Chairman)yal Commission on the Sugar Supply, 3 Or0 svenc r Ca r den s, S.&apos;$r. 1.2nd November, 1920.
