O CABINET.ENQUIRY INTO THE CLASSES OF BX-SSRVICE MEN.BEOEJVINA OUT-0?-WORK DOMATIOg AT 15TH SEPT3M3ER, 192Q, Roto by the Minister of labour.*** - * mWmmmmm- --  &quot;i - m n &apos; t        i-nrap-j mini nm il.l.i.i hi i n   m in 11.11 uim jilIiu-RBT* With roferonce to Cabinet 43 (20) conclusion 4 (b), Ihave already circulated the rosalts of an exan1.inav.i03a of the classes of ex-Service men on Donation at 15th September 1980 in the London area (0.P.1966 and 1966(a)) and in the Bristol Area (C.P.2036).I have now had a similar analysis prepared for Wales, Dundee and Dublin.For the oonvenlenoe of my colleagues I attach a oomparativo summary of the more important faets in each of the five localities in question.(a) The general conclusions reached in the cases of London and Bristol, in regard to the representative nature of the military servioe rendered by these men (both as to branch of servioe and sorvioe abroad), th*a large propor-tion of unskilled and the large numbers of younger men. are borne out in the oases of Wales. Dundee and Dublin, subject to the special points mentioned below.(b)   As regards Dundee, the most important industry -jute manufabture&apos;&apos;- accounts for nearly zzfo of the total numbers unemployed,(q)   As regards Dublin, of those who served abroad (86$ of the &quot;total) 21*zfo served for 4 years or more; ooutrary to the experience of other places, there is a large proportion of older men among the number unemployed, the proportion increasing in eaoh age group from the youngest to the oldest; and the average unemployment per man is 52 weeks (33 for non-disabled, 66 for disabled), - a muoh higher average than that for any of the other places ,so far examined.(d)   The figures on line 7 of tho summary (no pre-servioe unemployment) must be aooepted with oautionf in view of the lapse of time since the period to whioh they relate; &quot;but it should be remembered that &quot;Just before and during the war employment was exceptionally good.(Intld.)
