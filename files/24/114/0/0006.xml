This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government,:   ^ ^SECRET.8CP,  2006Kft^    ^-^W THE CABINET.ARTIFICERS  AND  DRIVERS  FOR  ARMY  mechanical transport.MEMORANDUM BY TI E SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR. I circulate a Memorandum which has been prepared by the Adjutant-General.w. s. c.The War Office,23rd October, 1920.1. Serious difficulty is being found in obtaining artificers and mechanical transport     27 drivers to meet the needs of the Army. A.S.C.The difficulty may be due possibly in&apos; part to shortage of this class of personnel 2947 in the market and the increasing demands for Government requirements. But it is important to note that this difficulty shows no sign of decreasing with the advent of trade depression, and that everything possible has been done to meet Army requirements by training men in the Army a process which in the case of artificers takes at least three years.2. The main trouble is undoubtedly due to the high rates offered by various Government Departments in competition with each other and the fact that there is no effective controlling or co-ordinating authority. Men are not going to enlist in the Army when terms far higher are being offered by other Government Departments.3. For instance, the Irish Office has recently been advertising for men of these classes,offering rates of pay which aggregate two or three times the rates for corresponding grades in the Army, as will be seen by the comparative Table A attached.The India Office, which uses Royal Army Service Corps personnel for the Indian Army, has asked for considerable drafts from the War Office, and contemplates, if these are not forthcoming, recruiting British personnel independently and offering high premiums to men who will come forward.4. It would therefore appear essential that some co-ordinating Cabinet authority should be set up, presided over by a Cabinet Minister, similar to the arrangement established during the war,(a.) To settle which are the most urgent Government requirements, allocating priority to these and fixing the numbers to which the priority should apply.(6.) To fix the terms which each Government Department may offer, based upon their respective priorities.5. This question is one of the utmost urgency, not only in the interest of economy, but in order that serious breakdown may be averted in essential services, and it is considered that immediate action is necessary. The matter is, therefore, referred to the Cabinet for decision.(B20/4S0)   100  10/20   H&amp;S, Ltd.  8648wo[p.T.o.
