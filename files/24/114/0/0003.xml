PART I-THE LABOUR SITUATION,THE GENERAL SITUATION.general survey of the week,The strike notices of members of the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain were allowed to expire on the 16th October, and the coal strike may therefore be said to have commenced on the 18th, on which, day the suspension of work in the collieries of Great Britain was complete. The decision of the Miners&apos; Federation on the 23rd September that, in the event of a strike, such work should be allowed as is necessary for maintaining the mines in condition, so that no delay need take place in resuming coal-getting at the close of the strike, has been put into operation, though in Scotland and South Wales threats to withdraw the men at work under this arrangement are reported.The coal strike affects the labour situation in two broad ways. Firstly, there is the question, now being discussed by the other national bodies of organised labour, of the policy that ought to be adopted in the circumstances. Three organisations, in particular, are concerned&apos;, namely, the National Union of Railwaymen, the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation, and the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen. By each of these bodies very definite issues of trade union policy have to be determined. For example, in the case of the National Union of Railwaymen, local branches in Wales and District Councils in Scotland are urging a sympathetic strike. Turbulent spirits may wish to exploit the disaffection of those grades of railwaymen, particularly signalmen, whose permanent wages basis has yet to be settled, and may be urging that the union&apos;s officials should take this opportunity to force an agreement. Indi-vidual railwaymen all over the country may wish for guidance as to what attitude they should adopt, for example, towards the movement of coal trains. It is because of these problems, that the General Meeting, the all-powerful gdverning body of the National Union of Railwaymen, was summoned for the 20th. The following resolution was passed by the General Meeting on the 21st October: &quot; This Special General Meeting, having carefully considered the position created by the miners&apos; strike, and being satisfied that their claims are reasonable and just and should be conceded forthwith, decides to instruct the General Secretary to intimate to the Prime Minister that unless the miners&apos; claims are granted, or negotiations resumed, by Saturday, October 23rd, which result in a settlement, we shall be compelled to take the necessary steps to instruct our members in England, Scotland and Wales to cease work. In addition, a telegram is being despatched to all members to be prepared to cease work at 12 midnight on Sunday next unless they hear to the contrary.&quot; The executive of the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen have similarly been in session at Leeds. The Council of the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation have also been in session, but are more immediately concerned with the threatened strike in the road transport industry.The second way in which the coal strike affects the labour situation lies in its effect upon the unemployment position. Details are giVen below of the latest returns to hand with regard to this aspect of the problem. A special emergency out-of-work donation scheme is being brought into operation for ex-members of H.M. Forces and merchant seamen, who are entitled to out-of-work donation. Persons of the age of 17 and over, insured under the National Insurance (Unemployment) Acts, 1911 to 1919, may also be eligible to receive unemployment benefit. The rates of emergency donation are 205. per week for men and 15s. for women. The rate of unemployment benefit is Us. for men and women, and half that rate for boys and girls. Special arrangements may be made with the larger employers for their assistance in the administration of the scheme. The necessary preparations are, of course, being made by other Government departments to meet any emergencies that may arise in the supply and transport of food and other necessaries.Apart altogether from the possible effects of the coal strike, the problem of unemploy-ment, especially in London, has excited attention during the week. The demonstration in London on the 18th October ended in a conflict between certain sections of the demon-strators and the police. An account is given below of the interview between the Prime Minister and the deputation of London mayors to which the demonstration was an accom-paniment.
the general situation-continued.The Prime Minister in the House of Commons, on the 19th October, outlined the proposals of the Cabinet Committee on Unemployment which was set up in August last. He announced that, over and above the proposed agreement with the operatives and employers in the building trades, definite proposals were being considered for the em-ployment of large numbers of ex-Service men on the housing programme. Other pro-posals for the employment of fit ex-Service men on road making and road improvement had been approved by the Cabinet. The London County Council, it was hoped, would assume responsibility for a substantial proportion of the cost of this scheme, in so far as it affects London, and thus relieve the poorer Metropolitan boroughs. An appeal was being made to trade unions to suspend or vary their rules so as to permit additional men being admitted into certain trades in which there had been a serious shortage of skilled labour, namely, the foundry trades, iron puddling, and railway wagon building.The position in the road transport industry is threatening. An account of the negotiations during the week is given below.With regard to the political aspects of the labour situation, the coal strike, and, to a less extent, the situation in Ireland, have completely overshadowed a threatened renewal of active agitation on the conveyance of munitions to Poland. The Houses of Parliament resumed their sittings on the 19th October, and the House of Commons devoted that day to a discussion of the coal position. Progress has yet to be completed with.regard to the following Bills affecting labour: The Factories and Workshops (Bakehouses) Bill, the Shops (Early Closing, No. 2) Bill, the Women and Young Persons (Employment in Lead Processes) Bill, and the Women, Young Persons and Children (Employment)&apos; the unemployment position.The Coal Strike and Unemployment. Arrangements have been made by the Ministry of Labour to collect, through the Employment Exchange organisation, particulars of the increase in unemplojanent caused by the miners&apos; strike. Returns show that, on the 8th October, 244,729 out-of-work donation policies and unemployment books were lodged . at the exchanges in England and Wales. On the 18th October the total was 263,375 ; and on the 19th October, 293,788. The increase is most marked, proportionately, in the Northern Division, where the total on the &apos;8th October was more than doubled on the 19th. The total in Scotland stood at 19,656 on the 8th October, and at 21,901 on the 19th.Returns, classified by industry, for the 18th and 19th October show that, so far as reported, 28,700 discharges, in round numbers, were due to the entire clo.sure of works and 82,550 to reduction in staff, giving a total of 111,250. In addition 10,000 workers had been placed on short time. The industries mainly affected were iron and steel manu-facture, which accounted for 75,3^0 discharges, and shipbuilding and engineering, which accounted for nearly 15,790 discharges and more than a quarter of the short-time working. . The textile trade, other than woollen and worsted, was also affected. A report from the North-Western Division, for the 18th October, stated that most of the cotton mills were then carrying on as usual, and had sufficient coal for at least a week. At Stretford, however, electric power is to be cut off each week from Thursday evening till Monday morning, and large firms dependent on this power supply will have to suspend work during that time.  It is estimated that 25,000 workers will be affected.Other Statistics.-rThe number of H.M. Forces and merchant seamen out-of-work donation policies current for the week ending the 8th October was 168,824, made up of 168,282 lodged by men and 542 by women. On the 1st October there were 162,591 policies current, 162,040 for men and 551 for women.On the 8th October, 119,469 unemployment books, 82,211 for males and 37;258 for females; remained lodged by workers under the Unemployment Insurance Acts. Corn-pared with the previous week, when there were 77,336 books lodged by males and 34J250 by females, the total increase is 7,783.The total on the live registers of all Employment Exchanges on the 8th October and a detailed analysis of the unemployment position at that date will be found on page 494.
FEATURES OF THE WEEK.general topics.Labour and Russia. The joint meeting of the Parliamentary committee of the Trades Union congress, the&apos; National Executive of the Labour Party, and the Parliamentary Labour Party the three national bodies who formed the Council of Action which was summoned as a result of M. Fimmen&apos;s recent letter, calling attention to the continued transport of munitions to Poland,* was held on the 18th October at caxton Hall, West-minster. The proceedings were private, but it is understood that the information which has been collected by members of the Council as to the supply of munitions and material to Poland was the subject under consideration.It may be noted that this agitation, which began as a protest against alleged govern-ment policy, is now being extended apparently to cover the supply of munitions to Poland through ordinary commercial channels.As a preliminary to this conference, a number of meetings of local Councils of Action were held throughout the country on the 17th October. Resolutions were passed demanding immediate peace with soviet Russia, and the introduction of prompt measures to alleviate unemployment. From Press reports, it would seem that the miners&apos; strike and the gravity of the unemployment problem combined to overshadow the formal object of these meetings, which tended, therefore, to follow the line of the ordinary week-end demonstrations.Labour and Ireland. The joint meeting of the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress, tl)e National Executive of the Labour Party, and the Parliamentary Labour Party, referred to above, also considered the situation in Ireland. A deputation of representatives of the Irish Labour Party and Trades Union Congress, consisting of Messrs. Johnston1, Foran, McPharland and Cathal 0&apos;Shannon, was received by the con-ference and gave a report upon the position of affairs in Ireland. lit is understood that a proposal to appoint a joint committee, representative of the three British organisations and of the Irish Labour Party and Trades Union Congress, to investigate the position and draw up a report, was considered, and that it was decided that the deputation should submit the proposal to the Irish Labour Party as a whole, before further steps are taken.With regard to the situation in Belfast, the Amalgamated Engineering Union have asked their branches for voluntary subscriptions to relieve the immediate needs of members affected by the boycott. The United Operative Plumbers&apos; and Domestic Engineers&apos;&apos;Association have taken a ballot of their Belfast members on the question whether they are prepared to work harmoniously with their fellow-craftsmen irrespective of political or religious opinions. only a quarter of the members recorded their votes, 75 per cent, of which were in the affirmative. It is stated that the whole position will be considered this week by the executive committee of the National Federation of Engineering and ship-buildirig Trades. The railway situation in Ireland is reported to-have become more acute during the past week, and the Irisli&apos; Labour (Party have directed the &quot; Local Food Com-mittees,&quot; recently established in &quot;view of the possibility that the railways might be closed down, to make preparations for any emergency which may arise.Unemployment Insurance&apos;Act, 1920. The sub-committee, representative of employers and operatives in the Lancashire cotton industry, who have been considering the advisability-bility of contracting out of the Act, held a meeting oh the 19th October, when it was stated that negotiations for a scheme which would meet the views of all parties concerned had broken down. The representatives of the Federation of Master. Cotton spinners&apos; Associa-tions and of the Cotton Spinners and Manufacturers&apos; Association, in an official report of the meeting, stated that, in view of the many practical difficulties involved in the adminis-tration of a contracting-out scheme, the employers &apos;had informed the operatives that they must recommend the adoption of the Government scheme. Some dissatisfaction at this decision has been expressed by the representatives of the United Textile Factory Workers&apos; Association.With regard to the woollen and worsted industries, opposition to the scheme for contracting out of the Act is reported on the part of some of the master spinners.  The
See also p. 490 below.scheme is strongly supported by the operatives, who urge that, as under-employment rather than total unemployment is the problem to be met in this particular industry, the State scheme provides no solution. As an instance the National Society of Wool-combers and Kindred Trades is cited. The society contains over 12,000 members, of whom at present 300 are totally unemployed, 700 are fully employed, and the remainder are working three or four days a week. Thus the majority, who are on short time, would, under the official scheme, be forced to contribute to the fund without being able to parti-participate in the benefits, which can be granted only to those totally unemployed. A similar state of affairs is said to exist in the dyeing, spinning and weaving sections of the industry. Trade unionists in the woollen and worsted industries are therefore urging the advantages of the contracting-out scheme, which in any case cannot now be got into operation before the*8bh November.A further resolution protesting against the exclusion of agricultural workers from the Act was passed at a conference representing over 120 branches of the National Union of Agricultural Workers, held at Exeter last week.A sub-committee of the South Wales Miners&apos; Federation met on the 11th October to discuss the provisions of the Act. They were informed that the executive of the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain were considering the position of miners under the Act, and that members were therefore advised not to take any action pending a report from the national executive. The Hearts of Oak Benefit Society have decided that it is not advisable, in the best interests of their members, for the society to participate in the administration of the Act.Employment Exchanges. The Departmental Committee appointed in June last &quot; to examine the working and administration of the Employment Exchanges in Great Britain and to advise as to their future &quot; resumed their sittings on the 19th October.Women, Young Persons and Children (Employment) Bill. In connection with the Home Office departmental inquiry into the working of the two-day shift system, the Welfare Workers&apos; Institute have recently invited their 450 members to express their opinions as to the effect of this system on the employed persons concerned. It has been commonly stated that 66 per cent, were against the system, 27 per cent, in favour, and 7 per cent, neutral. But it is not generally known that only 75 members have felt them-selves qualified to express an opinion.On the other hand, a resolution has been adopted by the Bristol Education Committee, calling upon the Home Office to allow the two-shift system for women and young persons to continue temporarily, where it has already been in operation during the war, provided that no young person under the age of 16 years be employed under the system, and that adequate provision be made for meals in the factories. The committee are concerned at the amount of juvenile unemployment in the city, which will probably be aggravated at Christmas by the terminal influx of children into the labour market.Housing. The National Federation of Building Trades Operatives have summoned a special conference of affiliated unions to be held in Manchester next week. This con-ference will consider what action the Federation should take with regard to the modified adult apprenticeship scheme of the Resettlement Committee of the Industrial Council for the Building Industry, which, together with the scheme for the payment for &quot; wet time &quot; to men engaged on housing schemes, forms the basis of a proposed national agree-ment between the Government, the masters, and the men, with a view to increasing the supply of skilled labour.available for housing schemes, and increasing output.*The statement that the Government are considering further proposals for the employ-ment of large numbers of ex-Service men on the housing programme has greatly disturbed the trade union officials, and may affect the reception by the unions of the adult apprentice-ship scheme.Building Guilds.-Th% Walthamstow and Greenwich municipal authorities have negotiated contracts with the London Guild of Builders, Ltd., for the building of houses. In both cases materials will be supplied by the Co-operative Wholesale Society. The Leeds City Council.and the Alderley Edge Urban District Council have accepted guild tenders, the Leeds contract making the twelfth which has been undertaken by the Man-chester Building Guild.
Building Trades: Conciliation Machinery.-It is stated that the scheme for establishing a National wages Council in tli3 building trade* has been adopted by the members of the; Amalgamated Society of Carpenters, Cabinet Makers and Joiners, 17,020 voting for the proposal and 6,452 against it.Relief of Unemploijment^ (London).-In connection with the question of unemployment in London, the Prime Minister received, on the 18th October, a deputation consisting of the Mayors of Hackney, Battersea, Poplar, Bermondsey, Fulham, Bethnal Green, Stepney, Woolwich, Greenwich, Shoreditch, and Camberwell. Representatives of the unemployed in the various districts and of ex-Service men&apos;s associations were also present. The Prime Minister, in replying to the deputation, gave some indication of the schemes formulated by the Cabinet Committee on Unemployment, and recommended that the deputation should at once get into touch with the London County Council, who had been asked to assume responsibility for a portion of the cost of the scheme, and who were about to appoint a committee to consider the Government^ proposals.Cotton Textile Industry. The result of the ballot of the members of the Federation of Master Cotton Spinners&apos; Associations on the policy of an organised curtailment of production by the introduction of short time was made known at a meeting of the General Committee in Manchester on the 15th October. In the Egyptian section of the industry the result of the ballot was in favour of curtailment, but in the American section the required majority was not obtained. Under the rules of the Federation such a proposal must secure the votes of the owners of 80 per cent, of the spindles. a percentage of 86 was secured in the Egyptian section, and of 79 in the American; as the deficiency in the latter section is so small, it has been decided to reopen the matter at the next monthly meeting of the committee, on the 5th November.Fair Wages Advisory Committee. A meeting of the Fair Wages Advisory Committee was held on the 7th October to consider, inter alia, the proposal that Government contracts should be limited to firms on the King&apos;s National Roll. The contracting departments explained the difficulties which they encountered in giving effect to the arrangement, which has been in. operation since June last, by which preference in placing contracts is given to firms on the National Roll. Provided that suitable arrangements could be made for exceptional cases, it appeared that the departments might be able to adopt the general principle that contracts should be limited to firms on the Roll. Eventually it was arranged that the departments should consider the following proposal and suggest such amendments as would enable them to support it: (a) That, as from a date to be fixed, say three months after the date on which the decision is announced, Government contracts shall be awarded only to those firms whose names are inscribed on the King&apos;s National Roll.(6) That any necessary exception be made to meet the case of work which could be performed by, or materials which could be procured from, only a few firms in Great Britain, none of which was on the King&apos;s National Roll.(c) That in any trades or industries in which it was thought thatia percentage lower than 5 per cent, should be accepted, and none has yet been fixed, the Employment Department should negotiate with the interests concerned, with a view to determining such percentages.(d) That for the present this arrangement should apply only to Great Britain.On receipt of the replies it will be decided whether another meeting is necessary to consider the matter further.Board of Education: Salaries of Elementary School Teachers. The Standing Joint Committee, representing associations of local education authorities and the National Union of Teachers, which was constituted under the chairmanship of Viscount Burnham &quot; to secure the orderly and progressive solution of the salary problem in public elementary schools by agreement on a national basis &quot; have supplemented their first report, issued in November last year, by a second. The former presented for adoption a provisional minimum salary scale; the latter, in addition to the announcement of further standard rates, deals especially with the application of the standard scales to the several areas. It invites each local education authority to negotiate with the teachers in their area for a preliminary agreement, and states that a schedule showing the scale considered as appro-priate to each local education authority will be issued in the course of the next six months. The adoption of these scales will extend the period of the truce under which the teachers are to abstain from pressure on the authorities until the 1st April, 1925.
(p Special provision, however, is made for readjusting these standard scales in the event of the cost-of-living index, published by the Ministry of Labour, reaching 170 after the 1st April, 1921, and remaining at or above that level for six months afterwards.One Union for Agriculture. The November issue of The Land Worker, the official organ of the National Union of Agricultural Workers, has a leading article on the suggestion which has recently been made to the effect that farmers as well as agricultural labourers should unite &quot; and form one big strong union that shall be truly representative of agriculture as a whole.&quot; The Land Worker regards the suggestion unfavourably, on the ground that &quot; the Farmers&apos; Union and ourselves are in opposing camps for the time being,&quot; although it goes on. to admit that &quot; things not possible now may become feasible later on.&quot; The only policy practicable at present, in its opinion, is that the labourers&apos; unions and the Farmers&apos; Union should co-operate wholeheartedly wherever possible, and that con-ciliation, arbitration, and a readiness to meet one another should be encouraged.industrial and other organisations.Trades Union Congress -The Special Committee set up at the close of the Portsmouth Congress in September last to inquire into the alleged bartering of votes, by or on behalf of candidates for the Parliamentary Committee, concluded their sittings on the 15th October, and have now issued their report. The report states that there is abundant evidence that systematic canvassing and bartering of votes has been carried on for many years past. It recommends, however, that the committee elected at Portsmouth should retain their seats, but that in future the standing orders which prohibit bartering and canvassing should be rigidly enforced. It is also pointed out that with the inauguration of the new General Council next year, the possibility of bartering will be materially minimised.The new Parliamentary Committee met on the 20th October and appointed Mr. E. L. Poulton, O.B.E., J.P., secretary of the National Union of Boot,and Shoe Operatives, as chairman for the forthcoming year.National Transport Workers&apos; Federation. In accordance with the policy endorsed by the annual general meeting of the Federation at Southampton last June, steps are being taken to expedite the amalgamation of all the affiliated unions, with the exception of the seamen&apos;s, into one large union. The ultimate aim of this amalgamation is the establish-ment in the road and water transport industry of a union analogous to the National Union of Railwaymen, with a similar consolidation of executive power.The means adopted to secure the fulfilment of this object have been the promotion of schemes for sectional amalgamation. Considerable progress has been made with a draft scheme for the amalgamation of the 15 unions dealing with waterside and dock labour, * and a number of road transport workers have been absorbed by the United Vehicle Workers. The seafaring unions, who are also proceeding with draft proposals to amal-gamate, will not be included in the general scheme.A much more ambitious scheme has now been drafted, providing for five national industrial groups, governed by a National Administrative Council of 16 members. The country will be divided into 11 areas, each group being represented in the area, and each area having an Area Council. The different groups will have their own National Adminis-trative Committees, but power to decide strike action will rest with the National Adminis-trative Council, and this body will also control finance and general policy. The organisation is apparently planned to give control in technical matters to the industrial groups, whilst the National Council has final authority. It is suggested that the National Council shall be elected on the basis of area representation by ballot vote of the whole area, and that each of the five national groups shall also have a representative thereon, so that not only will there be area representation, but the technical experience of each group will also be represented. The boundaries of the areas in question are under consideration by a sub-committee.The Federation are anxious to have the draft scheme completed in all its details before the end of the year, when it will be presented to the unions for consideration, and arrangements for a ballot vote will be made.National Amalgamated Furnishing Trades Association. A national delegate meeting of the association was held in Manchester last week to consider proposed amendments of the rules.  It was agreed that the scope of the association should be extended to include all
NEGOTIATIONS AND DISPUTES.Demands and Negotiations.Building Operatives (Scotland). In anticipation of the expiry on the 30th November next of the wages clause of the agreement reached on the 8th July between the Scottish National Building Trades Federation (Employers) and the Building Trades of Scotland Operatives&apos; Wages and Conditions of Service Board, the latter organisation have submitted to the employers a fresh demand for an increase of id. per hour, to cover the period from . the 1st December, 1920, to the 31st March, 1921.workers employed in the industry, that the executive committee should in future be elected as a national body instead of being composed of London members only, and that for this purpose the country should be divided into eight electoral areas. To meet the extra work entailed by this extension, the number of national organisers is to be doubled, and district delegates will be appointed.Scottish Council for Women&apos;s Trades. The 25th annual meeting of the Council was held last week in Glasgow, under the presidency of the Rev. Dr. David Watson. Miss Irwin, the general secretary, presented the annual report, which dealt with investigations made into various industries, employing women and girls, where low wages and bad condi-tions prevail.   The meeting appointed officers for the forthcoming year.Trade Union Topics.National Union of Woolsorters. Arrangements have now been completed for the amalgamation of the National Union of Woolsorters with the Bradford Woolsorters&apos; Society. The new organisation, which will come into existence on the 1st January, 1921, will be known as the National Society of Woolsorters.National Association of Church and Mission Keepers. At the annual delegate meeting of this association, on the 16th October, a recommendation of the executive committee to amalgamate with the National Union of General Workers was discussed. It was unani-mously decided to take a ballot of the members on the question.Ex-Service Men.Carpenters and Joiners (Wrexham). The action of the Amalgamated Society of Car-penters, Cabinet Makers and Joiners in withdrawing their labour from the&apos;firm of Messrs. W. Thomas &amp; Co., Ltd., Wrexham, owing to the employment of a number of ex-Service men on semi-skilled work* has been strongly condemned by the Manchester, Salford and District Ex-Service Men&apos;s Joint Council. The Council consider that this is a &quot; test case &quot; of trade union opposition to the employment of ex-Service men on the ground,that it involves &quot; dilution.&quot; It is intended that the incident shall not be allowed to drop. The Council consists of representatives of the Comrades of the Great War, of the two national organisations of discharged sailors and soldiers, and of various other ex-Service men&apos;s associations in the Manchester area.International Relations of Labour.International Conference of Commercial Employees. An international conference of unions representing commercial employees has recently been held at Amsterdam. Seven countries in all were represented, namely, Great Britain (by delegates from the National Amalgamated Union of Shop Assistants, Warehousemen and Clerks, and the Amalgamated Union of Co-operative and Commercial Employees and Allied Workers), France, Germany, Holland, Austria, Hungary and Czechoslovakia. It was agreed by the conference that there should in future be one international trade union representing commercial employees and that it should be based on the principles governing the constitution of the International Federation of Trade Unions, and affiliated to this Federation. A commission representative of six countries was accordingly appointed to draw up a draft constitution for the new body, the headquarters of which will be in Amsterdam. It was decided that next year&apos;s congress should be held in Vienna.
negotiations and disputes-continued.Commercial Road Transport Workers (National). This week has seen a change in the position as regards the dispute over the claim of the commercial road transport section of the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation for a weekly minimum of  4 7s. The tentative arrangements made for holding a conference on the 19th October of the parties formerly represented on the Joint Industrial Council, broke down in view of the refusal of the employers to negotiate on the wages issue. On the 20th, however, the Ministry of Labour arranged a meeting of the employers&apos; side, which offered &quot;to deal with applications on a local basis. Meanwhile, on the 16th, a delegate meeting, representing 25,000 London commercial road transport workers, endorsed the decision to tender strike notices for expiry on the 23rd. On the 19th, a special.national delegate conference instructed all men engaged in commercial road transport to hold themselves in readiness for immediate drastic action. This conference met again on the 20th when several delegates representing the northern unions broke away in protest against ^he delay, Mr. A. Hilton, general secretary of the United Carters and Motormen&apos;s Association, declaring that in the Yorkshire area the notices to cease work would terminate on the 21st, and that the strike would take effect on the 22nd; whatever might be decided by the conference for the rest of the country. After considering the employers&apos; proposal, the conference issued a statement to the effect that they were in consultation with the individual unions of the section with a view to taking the necessary steps to enforce their claim, and that the executive committee of the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation would consider the position on the 21st.*Operative Bakers (South Wales). The South Wales and West of England Federation of Master Bakers&apos; Associations have not only refused to allow the Joint Conciliation Board, recently formed in the baking and confectionery trades in South Walesf to consider the demand of the South Wales district of the Amalgamated Union of Operative Bakers, Confectioners and Allied Workers for an increase of  1 per week and a weekly reduction of hours by six, but have themselves rejected the demand. The separate branches have, therefore, been instructed to negotiate locally with the respective masters&apos; associations. In the meantime, it is understood that notices are in the hands of the district committee, and that strikes may be expected in those localities where a settlement proves impossible.Strikes and Lock-outs.Coal Miners (National). In accordance with the decision of the National Delegate Conference of the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain on the 14th October, to accept the recommendation of the executive committee that strike notices should be allowed to expire on the 16th, the coal strike began on the 18th. Negotiations between the miners and the Government were effectively ruptured by the refusal of the Delegate Conference, on the 14th, to remain in session to receive any fresh proposals from the Government. The meeting of the Delegate Conference, on the 15th, was very much a formal meeting to receive the Prime Ministers reply to the letter informing him of the actual ordering of the strike. The National Delegate Conference had already arrived at a virtual decision that only the complete granting of their wages demands could avoid a strike.The Delegate Conference of the Miners&apos; Federation, on the 23rd September, decided that arrangements should be made in all districts for all the men necessary for pumping, lowering and , raising of men, and generally for keeping the collieries in order, to remain at work so that when the strike might be ended, output of coal could be resumed as soon as possible. The executive council of the South Wales Miners&apos; Federa-tion, however, passed a resolution on the 16th, recommending that, in the event of a settlement not being achieved on or before the 30th October, representations should be made to the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain to convene a National Delegate Con-ference, to be held on the 27th October, to consider the advisability of withdrawing the whole of the men from the collieries. This resolution will be considered by a Delegate Conference of the South Wales Miners&apos; Federation on the 22nd. The executive of the Lanarkshire Miners&apos; County Union passed, on the 19tli, a similar recommendation, which is to be considered by the Council of the National Union of Scottish Mine Workers on the 25th.Settlements and Agreements.Seamen and Firemen (Dublin). The unofficial strike of members of the National Sailors and Firemen&apos;s Union at Dublin came to an end on the 14th October, the men resuming work as the result of a personal appeal of the Lord Mayor of Dublin.* It was decided on that date that the Federation would drop the national claim, and that applications by the unions concerned would be made locally.f See this Report, Vol. II, No. 15, 9th October, p. 436.
Negotiations and Disputes-continued.i If Pianoforte Workers (London). In connection with the strike of London pianoforte H workers, which began on the 11th April by way of protest against the adoption of piece-work, it will be remembered that, under the agreement which was arrived at on the 5th July,* one of the conditions of resumption of work was that a &quot; vote should be taken within the next three months in all the shops as to whether the industry should work the piece-work system or revert to day-time rates.&quot; This ballot has now been taken; 4,498 votes were given in favour of the time system and 2,068 votes for the system of payment by results. The workers concerned are members of the National Amalgamated Furnishing Trades Association.Operative Bakers (Midland Area). The Midland district of the Amalgamated Union of Operative Bakers, Confectioners and Allied Workers, who had threatened to strike on their claim for an advance of 10s. weekly, have agreed to accept the offer of the Bir-mingham and Midland Federation of Master Bakers&apos; Associations of a 6s. increase.[Other disputes, negotiations and settlements are referred to in the Industrial Relations Departments section of the Report, pages 487 to 489.]
PART IL-THE WORK OF THE MINISTRY.INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS DEPARTMENT.ARBITRATION AND CONCILIATION.awards.The number of awards issued during the week was five, of which two were under the Industrial Courts Act, one by a single arbitrator, and two by ad hoc boards.Bricklayers and Building Labourers in Ironworks (Stoke-on-Trent). It was decided that the wages of the bricklayers and building labourers, previously regulated by the movements of wages in the engineering and foundry trades, should be raised to the Biddulph district rate of thdir trade, at both the Norton and the Biddulph works. (Award No. 498.)agreements and settlements.Carters (Ipswich). Members of the United Vehicle Workers employed in Ipswich threatened to strike on the 25th September, for increased wages and a 48-hour week. The two sides were brought together by the department, and after several meetings an agree-ment was reached on the 14th October, giving increases of from 5s. to 7s. per week, with overtime rates and a 48-hour week.Hairdressers (Birmingham). The dispute which arose over the demand made by the National Amalgamated Union of Shop Assistants, Warehousemen and Clerks on behalf of their members employed in the five shops of a Birmingham firm, for certain minimum rates, has now been settled. By the intervention of the Chief Conciliation Officer, the employers withdrew the notices given to the workpeople, on condition that the latter withdrew their claim for a  3 10s. minimum. In the smaller shops, the present wages are to be paid, plus 15 per cent, on saloon takings up to  5, and 25 per cent, on takings above  5, plus the usual commission on sales ; in larger shops, present wages plus 15 per cent, on saloon takings up to  7, and 25 per cent, on takings above  7, plus the usual commission on sales.Gas Workers (Merthyr). A complete stoppage of the gas supply was brought about by a strike of the employees of the Merthyr Gas Co., on the 8th October, owing to the refusal of three workers to rejoin the Workers&apos; Union or to join any other trade union. The strike was recognised by the Workers&apos; Union executive on the 11th. Through the intervention of the Chief Conciliation Officer at a general meeting of the strikers, the men agreed to return if the three gas fitters paid their entrance fees to the Workers&apos; Union. The three men agreed to do so, and work was resumed on the 12th October.Boot Last Makers (Midlands).-At a conference* held at Leicester on the 22nd September, the employers&apos; offer of advances of 5s., 3s., and 2s. per week to workers over 24 years, between 18 to 24, and under 18, respectively, and 5 per cent, advance on piece--prices, was accepted by the operatives in all districts concerned, except Leicester. The Leicester operatives, however, have been compelled to fall into line, and the matter is now closed.committees,  conferences and deputations.Regulation of Wages in Different Industries-Mr. A. C. Davis, managing director of the British Portland Cement Manufacturers, Ltd., London, discussed, on the 12th October, the possibility and desirability of manufacturers and employers of labour, generally, making combined efforts to regularise their action, with a view to avoiding great variations in conditions of payment, working hours and holidays, in the various industries. The firm had previously discussed the matter with the Federation of British Industries and. with the Confederation of Employers&apos; Associations, but had made no progress. The imme-diate cause of these discussions was the effect on the cement trade of the rates now paid
to labourers in the building trade. The demand for cement for building purposes is heavy, and likely to continue so, and it is therefore possible to pass on extra charges to the con-sumer. The effect on wages of the boom in the tinplate industry in South Wales and the competition for woodworkers in Liverpool was discussed. It was pointed out to Mr. Davis that the only effective way of securing uniformity of increases would be by State regulation of wages. His attention was drawn to the last two general awards in the engineering trade, and to the idea that wages should be based on the value of the work done, the result of which would be that advances in one trade might often be different from those in another. It was also suggested that the workers&apos; demands might be met by full and frank state-ments before the Industrial Council as to the position of the industry.Road Transport Industry. It has not been found possible to hold the meeting provisionally fixed for the 19th October, and the department are in further communication with the parties.  See also page 485 above.interpretations and  rulings.Wages (Temporary Regulation) Acts, 1918 and 1919.-The question as to whether there is power, subsequent to the 30th September, to take proceedings before a Munitions Tribunal in respect of an offence against the Wages (Temporary ^Regulation) Acts, 1918 and 1919, has been under consideration. Steps are to be taken to get the question settled by the High Court.Interpretation of Awards. The department is taking up with the Industrial Court the question as to whether it is within the competence of the Court to issue an interpretation (a) on the application of one party to the original award, the other party not agreeing, and (b) on the application of the Minister, one or both of the parties to the original award not agreeing.questions pending and miscellaneous.Vehicle Builders (Glasgow). The Chief Conciliation Officer, Glasgow, has ascertained that the Scottish Vehicle Builders&apos; Association and the National Union of Vehicle Builders are both anxious for an early settlement of the strike,* and he is taking steps to arrange a conference.Pottery Workers (Barnstaple). The employees, about 60 in all, of Mr. W. L. Baron and of Mr. C. H. Brannam, pottery manufacturers, struck on the 6th October, for an increase of 20 per cent, in wages, to meet the rising cost of living. A Conciliation Officer interviewed the employers and ascertained that they were prepared to submit the question to arbitration. To this, however, the strikers will not agree, and the employers now seem inclined to fight the matter out. It is understood that the strikers had been granted advances amounting from 157-1 to 250 per cent, over pre-war rates, and that the lowest wages paid was  3 4s. 9d. per week, against 18s. before the war.Porters (Govent Garden). Arising out of the claim made by the National Union of General Workers for an increase of 10s. on the standing wage on behalf of their members employed as porters in Covent Garden Market, the Chief Conciliation Officer, London, interviewed the secretary of the London Fruit, Flower, and Vegetable Market Association. The association were perfectly willing to discuss the claim with the union, but objected to the procedure which the union had adopted. It appears that after presenting their claim the union received a reply asking for fuller information, which they promised to obtain. Instead of doing this they proceeded to approach individual firms, who referred the matter back to their association.Woollen Workers (West Wales). The union officials have been unsuccessful in their attempt to secure a resumption of work at Cwerchyr. They are still endeavouring to find a solution.The strike occurred in support of a demand for the reinstatement of a dismissed man. It now transpires that the man was re-engaged after his original discharge, pending consultation between the firm and their association. The association, however, upheld the nrm&apos;s view, which was that the man should not be paid the full rate, owing to his physical unfitness. The firm have proposed to engage him as a weaver, but the union branch had passed a resolution that no on* should be promoted to weaver for five years. , The men refuse to resume Work until the matter is settled, holding that the declaration of a lock-out justifies such an attitude, however wrong their former action may have been.
A settlement is most difficult. The employers, owing to the trade slump, are indifferent, and most of the workers are only part-time hands, with small agricultural holdings, who regard the woollen trade as a side line.Dyers and Finishers (Manchester). Notice has been given to terminate the existing agreements in the dyeing and finishing trade on the 17th October, and a demand has been made for a 40 per cent, advance on current rates of wages, and a minimum of 25 per cent, over day-rates for piece-workers. A meeting of the parties was held at Manchester on the 6th October. The employers refused to concede the advances demanded, but agreed that the point might be suitably determined by arbitration. The parties, however, were unable to agree upon the precise form which arbitration should take, but it is hoped that with the assistance of the Chief Conciliation Officer, this difficulty may be overcome. In the meantime, work is being continued upon weekly notice and an immediate cessation of work appears improbable. It is understood that not less than 80,000 workpeople are involved.Council Employees (Cardiganshire). The joint conference* of representatives of the Council and of the union, on the 11th October, resulted in a complete deadlock. The employers&apos; side made an offer of 50s. per week which the men&apos;s representatives refused to accept as the Carmarthenshire roadmen had recently received a further advance to 61s. The union offered to return to work at 50s. if the Council would go to arbitration on the remainder of the claim, but this was refused. The union have decided to continue the strike, and are now claiming the Carmarthenshire increases.INDUSTRIAL COUNCILS. JOINT STANDING INDUSTRIAL COUNCILS.Negotiations.Sea-Fishing (Grimsby). No further meeting of this proposed Council has been held, owing to the preparations which have been made in view of a coal strike. The deadlock, however, resulting from the fact that the National Union of British Fishermen had with-drawn from the scheme because the National Sailors and Firemen&apos;s Union had been asked to come in, was satisfactorily settled at the end of August.Reports.Scottish Baking. The Reference Committee met on the 11th October, and considered applications for advances in wages from Perth, Hawick&apos;, Galashiels and Falkirk. In none of these cases did the committee give any decision. In the case of Falkirk they recom-mended that the claim should be heard before a joint meeting of employers and of the five branches of the union in the district. On the 12th October the Council met to*discuss the question of female labour. The operatives&apos; side are bound by a decision of their delegate meeting in favour of eliminating women from the baking industry entirely. They were prepared, however, to discuss the scheme put forward in August by the employers, on the&apos;understanding that no woman labour should be employed on the handling of dough. In return they would not object to women doing cleaning work in the bakehouses, or handling the manufactured article. The making of oatcakes, it was agreed, was purely a woman&apos;s occupation. The proportion of women to men was fixed at one to four, exclu-sive of women employed on oatcake making. This scheme will be submitted to the Council&apos;s constituent associations, and, if approved, will be put to a ballot of the union&apos;s members.Bobbin and Shuttle Making. The secretary of the Council has reported that, although no meetings of the full Council have been held since January, the Council is still in a satis-factory condition. It has been found beneficial to divide the Council into sectional com-mittees, and these have met several times and are working well. There is no scope for District Councils in the industry, but works committees have been formed with happy results.Boot and Shoe Manufacturing.-Th.e annual meeting of the Council was held on the 14th October, when officers were elected for the ensuing year. A representative of the Employment Department attended to discuss the Unemployment Insurance Act, and a sub-committee was appointed to consider the possibility of setting up a special scheme.* Bee this Report, Vol. II, No. 13, 25th September, p. 404. &apos;
Building. The agreement with the Government, providing for the adoption of the adult apprenticeship scheme, and payment for time lost, through bad weather, will be referred to the constituent bodies of the Council without delay. It is understood that the representatives of the Operative Bricklayers&apos; Society will recommend the proposals to their executive at an early date, without awaiting a formal communication from the Resettlement Committee. The United Operative Masons&apos; Association of Scotland have already recommended the scheme to their members.Cement. The Council met on the 7th October. A new wages agreement, to continue in force for six months from the 7th October, was arrived at, under which a further advance is granted of \\d. per hour to men over 18, and Id. per hour to women, and to youths under 18, with time-and-a-half for overtime from Sunday midnight to Saturday midnight. The method of computing overtime for shift-workers is now under consideration.Electricity Supply. The District Council for the Yorkshire area met on the 13th October, and appointed a committee to get into touch with, the District Councils in the area, for other industries in which local authorities are concerned, with a view to co-ordinating the wages of general labourers. It was reported that the Amalgamated Engineering Union had decided to have only two representatives on the Council, and two members of the union have accordingly resigned. Other matters, referring to the basic rates schedule, were discussed. The National Council met on the 18th October. Owing to the difficulties experienced by members in attending meetings, it was resolved that substitutes should be allowed to attend. It was agreed that a conference of representatives from District Councils be called at an early date, if the District Councils express such a desire.Glass-The Council met on the 12th October. An address on the Education Act was given by a representative of the Board of Education. The Council decided to establish an Educational Sub-Committee. The question of contracting out of the Unemployment Insurance Act was referred to the sectional Councils for consideration.Local Authorities&apos; Non-Trading Services, Manual Workers (England and Wales). The District Council for the Western Counties met on the 6th October. Appeals against the grading system drawn up and circulated by the Council were heard and decided. The executive committee of the District Council for the South Midland Area met on the 11th October to consider the extension of the basic rates scheme to cover all grades of workmen. The District Council for the Southern Home Counties met on the 12th October, and agreed upon a classification of local areas within the scope of the Council into six zones, with appropriate minimum rates of pay for adult male able-bodied workers.Paint and Varnish. The Council, on the 14th October, approved the report of a sub-committee appointed to draw up a holiday scheme. Under the scheme every employee who keeps good time is to be given six consecutive days&apos; holiday, with pay, in addition to the usual statutory holidays.Printing. The sub-committee on unemployment met on the 11th October, and agreed a report for submission to the Council. The report recommends a special unemployment insurance scheme covering all the printing and allied trades, but suggests that the setting up of this scheme should be postponed until after six months&apos; experience of the national scheme. The report is short and does not go into detail, as the committee were not in possession of sufficient statistical information upon which to base a scheme.On the. 14th October the Council discussed the committee&apos;s report, but did not decide to take any action. A representative of the Unemployment Insurance Department was present and was questioned upon the details of the Act. The application of the Northern Newspaper Federation for representation on the Council was considered, but a decision was postponed until the next meeting, by which time, it was expected, the Newspaper Society, and possibly the Newspaper Proprietors&apos; Association, might also apply for repre-sentation. As the National Union of Bookbinders and Machine Rulers are now re-affiliated to the Printing and Kindred Trades Federation, it was agreed that two additional repre-sentatives should be permitted on each side, increasing the Council to 64 members. On the workers&apos; side, the bookbinders will be given two representatives. On the employers&apos; side, an additional representative will be given to the Scottish Alliance.&apos;On the 13th October, the master printers continued their negotiations with the Printing and Kindred Trades Federation, and, it is understood, made an offer of a flat increase of 5s. per week to men and 2s. per week to women, covering everybody in the trade. Negotiations with the Typographical Association were continued on the 14th October, when a similar offer was made by the master printers,  On both occasions the workers refused
to accept the offer, and the negotiations completely broke down. No mention was made of this wages situation at the meeting of the Council.Quarrying:. Freestone Section. The Morley and District Quarry Owners&apos; Association have decided not to join the Yorkshire Area Council for the Freestone Quarrying Industry.Rubber Manufacturing. The Edinburgh and East of Scotland District Council met on the 6th October. The question of the consideration of wages, arising out of the last meeting of the Council, was fully investigated. Owing to the action of the National Council in refusing to instruct the District Council to deal with wages questions, the District Council could not, under the circumstances, deal with the operatives&apos; &apos;wages application. The matter was finally left to be raised at some future date, if instructions should be received authorising the District Councils to deal with these matters.After the meeting, the same body of employers and operatives decided to set up an Edinburgh and East of Scotland District Conciliation Board. This Board will meet on the 21st October to deal with the operatives&apos; claim for wages advances. The secretary of the District Council was of opinion that, when once the wages question had been settled by the Conciliation Board, the District Council would be able to resume its meetings, to deal with general affairs. He emphasised the fact that the operatives&apos; side of the District Council are strongly in favour of district wage settlements.Silk. The Council met on the 13th October. They are making arrangements to consult other textile Industrial Councils on the contracting-out clauses of the Unemploy-ment Insurance Act, and on problems of demarcation.The-Executive Committee were instructed to collate evidence as to the success of works committees already established in the industry, and as to the desirability of recommending the establishment of such committees by all firms.Tramway. The Council met on the 14th October. The proposal to appoint a com-mittee to standardise duties and wages was set aside, the workpeople having intimated that they intended to put in a claim for a temporary advance of 12s. per week for all adult tramway workers within the scope of the Council, and 6s. per week for youths under 18, pending the consideration of standardisation. The Council will meet specially to hear the claim on the 26th October.Waterworks Undertakings. An adjourned conference was held on the 12th October, when it was agreed to set up a District Council for the South Midlands area. The model constitution adopted in the Home Counties was adopted with slight modifications. The first meeting will be held on the 16th November.Wool (and Allied) Textiles. A special meeting of the Council was held on the 8th October to consider the question of contracting out of the Unemployment Insurance Act. A draft scheme had been prepared by the Legislation Committee and submitted to the constituent associations. As certain associations had not had sufficient opportunity of considering the proposals, the employers&apos; side were not able to commit their members to the principle of contracting out, and further consideration of the question was postponed. The question of unemployment was considered, and the Council decided to recommend all employers in the textile trade to share out work during slack periods and so reduce dismissals to a minimum.Admiralty. At a meeting of the Council on the 15th October, a warm tribute, for his services as chairman, was paid by the trade union side to Lord Lytton, who has been transferred to the India Office. A motion asking that 12 days&apos; annual leave, with pay, should be granted to .all dockyard employees at Deptford, was not proceeded with, on the understanding that a similar application was being brought forward through the Trade Joint Councils, for consideration by the Government as a question affecting all depart-ments. The position of shop stewards was discussed, and it was agreed that the Admiralty should inform the yard officers that the trade union representatives appointed under the yard committee scheme were entitled to be regarded as accredited shop stewards.In the absence of the chairman, who is appointed by the Admiralty, it has been the practice of the Admiralty to appoint a deputy chairman. The trade union side ques-tioned this procedure, in view of the clause in the constitution which states that the vice-chairman, who is appointed by and from the trade union side, should preside in the absence of the chairman. Lord Lytton suggested that it probably facilitated the business of the Council to have as chairman a member of the Board, or a responsible official, and this view was accepted.Local Authorities&apos; Administrative, Technical and ClericalServices (England and Wales).-A conference of representatives of the local authorities in South Wales and Monmouthshire,

It was decided that, while neither the employers&apos; side nor the staff side in any way committed themselves to the salary scales, &amp;c, drawn up by the National Council, the conference recommended the setting up of a District Council for the area. A drafting committee was appointed to draw up a constitution.Local Authorities&apos; Administrative, Technical and Clerical Services (Scotland). The first meeting of the Council was held at Edinburgh on the 14th October. Officers were appointed, with an executive committee consisting of four members from each side. It was decided that meetings should be held on the third Tuesday in each month, the date of the next meeting being fixed for the 16 th November.Works Committees.Bobbin and Shuttle M&apos;aking.

Broadhurst &amp; Sons, Fenton, was attended, to explain the scope and functions of works committees, and to advise as to procedure.Silk. Mr. W. Bromfield, M.P., of the Amalgamated Society of Textile Workers and Kindred Trades, Leek, has stated that, owing to the inaction of the employers with regard to joint works committees, the trade unions are about to establish shop stewards&apos; committees in all the works in the Leek area. ,INTERIM INDUSTRIAL RECONSTRUCTION COMMITTEES.Gas Mantle. The Committee met on the 11th October. The chief business was the decision of the Committee to convert themselves into a Joint Industrial Council. A sub-committee of two a side, together with a representative of the department and the secretary was appointed to review the existing constitution and to make recommendations to the full committee on the 22nd November.Making-Vp and Packing of Textiles. The Committee met on the 14th October. The officers of the Committee for the previous year were re-elected. The question of making preparation for avoiding, as far as possible, discharges in case of slackness of work was discussed, and it was agreed that the trade union side should prepare schemes for the consideration of the Council at an early date. The provisions of a sickness scheme for the employees in the export packing industry were considered and generally approved.[Reference to matters of interest in connection &apos;with Industrial Relations will be found also on pages 478 to 486, 498 and 500.]
49323.10.26.Toy Trade Board (Great Britain). The Board resumed consideration of the minimum rates to be proposed for female workers, and resolved to issue a Notice of Proposal to fix minimum rates of wages for female workers, and overtime rates for female workers employed on time-work.The question of minimum rates for female piece-workers and for male workers was deferred until the next meeting.Cotton Waste Reclamation Trade Board (Great Britain). At the first meeting of the Board, it was resolved to issue a Notice of Proposal to fix general minimum time-rates and overtime rates for male and female workers, with lower rates for learners. It was also agreed to establish a District Trade Committee for Scotland, and to recommend to the Minister that the representative members of this committee should consist of two representatives of employers, two representatives of workers, three representatives of local employers, and three representatives of local workers.Tobacco Trade Board (Great Britain). The Board agreed to defer a proposal, sub-mitted by the representatives of workers, to vary the general minimum time-rates at present in operation, and to fix piece-work basis time-rates for male and female workers. Consideration of the draft Notice of Proposal with regard to overtime rates was also postponed.   A report from the Cigar Committee was referred back for reconsideration.Linen and Cotton Handkerchief and Household Goods and Linen Piece Goods Trade Board (Great Britain). The Board, after consideration of the objections which had been lodged, resolved to fix general minimum time-rates and overtime rates for female workers substantially in accordance with their Proposal dated the 26th July,* and to request the Minister to confirm the rates as fixed and to make them effective&apos;as from a date not later than the 15th November. It was also resolved to issue Notice of Proposal to fix general minimum time-rates for male workers, a piece-work basis time-rate for female workers, and overtime rates.Laundry Trade Board (Great Britain). The re-constituted Board considered objections lodged to the Notice of Proposal to vary the minimum rates for female workers, dated the 19th July,f and, in conjunction therewith, a letter from the Ministry of Labour regard-ing the provisions of the Notices which had previously been issued by the Board.The Board resolved to vary the minimum rates for female workers, and to issue a further Notice of Proposal, which should go out to the trade concurrently with the notice of variation. The minimum rates, as varied, are substantially as set out in the Notice of Proposal, except that the proposed variations in respect of the London area are entirely eliminated, and the variations proposed for the rest of the country are made to apply to the whole country, including the London area. Further, in view of the Ministers opinion, the minimum rates are expressed as hourly rates and not as weekly rates. The Board re-appointed a standing sub-committee, an. Institutional Laundries Committee, and a committee for considering permits of exemption, with some slight alteration in the membership.The Board considered a letter on the subject of the joint deputation from Trade Boards to the Minister, and nominated representatives to attend.Paper Box Trade Board (Great Britain). The Administrative Committee considered the question of co-operation between the Board and Juvenile Advisory Committees, and resolved to prepare a statement setting forth information with regard to the trade which might be of use to juveniles entering the trade, and helpful to Juvenile Advisory Com-mittees in establishing co-operation with the Board., A representative of the Ministry addressed the committee on the subject of the Ministers inability to confirm the overtime rates as set out in the Notices of Proposal dated the 29th May,J and the 4th August.^ The committee referred the matter to the Board for further consideration.-After consideration of the objections which had been lodged against their Notices of Proposal dated the 29th May,J and the 4th August^ and of the reports from District Trade Committees in respect thereof, the Board resolved to vary and fix minimum rates of wages for male and female workers as set out in the respective proposals subject to the amendment and deletion of certain overtime provisions. The Board agreed to the deletion of one of the overtime provisions referred to above, subject to its being submitted by the Minister to the Law Officers of the Crown with a view to an opinion being obtained as to its validity. The Board resolved to refer certain questions of scope to the Ministry of Labour.* See this Eeport, Vol. II, No. 6, 7th August, p. 225. f See this Report, Vol. II, No. 5, 31st July, p. 190.

Notice of Intention has been given to apply the Trade Boards Acts to the ophthalmic optical trade.INTELLIGENCE AND STATISTICS DEPARTMENT.PUBLICATIONS.Labour Overseas. The department have collected the several series of monthly reports, formerly circulated to various Government departments, in one quarterly publication, entitled Labour Overseas. The publication has now been placed on sale, at the price of 2s. Qd.Each issue will contain a summary of information on the Labour situation and Labour movements overseas, derived from the official publications of foreign and colonial Govern-ments and trade journals, including especially the Labour press of the British Dominions -and foreign countries. A topical survey is included, collecting the information from all countries under the heads most likely to be generally useful, and, in another summary, the material is arranged so as to give, separately for each country, a conspectus of current industrial history. An encyclopaedic appendix is designed to serve as a directory to Labour organisations and officials, and to administrative agencies dealing with Labour questions. .[References to matters of interest in connection with Trade Boards will also be found on page 484.]
show a decrease of 1,957 as regards men, and a decrease of 1,571 in respect of women&apos; All divisions except the Scotland Division report increases in the men&apos;s register, and all except the Northern and the Wales Divisions in the women&apos;s register.Statistical information as to the effect of the miners&apos; strike will be found on page 479. The following summary of the state of employment relates to the week ending the 8th October.Men&apos;.s Employment.General Industrial Situation. The depression which for some weeks past has been marked in certain industries is now affecting almost every industry in the country. Apart from a tendency among many firms to mark time pending the trend of events, both manu-facturers and merchants hold large stocks produced when costs were at their highest point. They are now faced with a falling market and a much reduced demand, and are compelled to curtail production.Shipbuilding and Other Industries. There are still indications of a shortage of ship-building material in Scotland, which is retarding the absorption of unemployed workmen. On Tyneside, employers still continue to discharge workpeople. On the other hand, the satisfactory position previously reported on the Tees still continues, although in some departments there are delays in the supply of material, which have rendered a number of workpeople temporarily idle. On the Mersey, ship building and repairing is still under a cloud &quot;through slackness and the effects of the shipwrights&apos; dispute. The latter factor appears to be specially felt at the dry docks, as ships cannot be berthed without the aid of shipwrights. At Southampton the outlook is not hopeful, and the unrest in the port is stated to be the cause of a large amount of ship-repair work being diverted to Belgium and Germany.The North-Western Division report that employment in the cotton trade is at a very low ebb, and the outlook is not at all promising. In all the leading cotton centres the operatives&apos; associations are experiencing a heavy drain on their funds, on account of the prolonged payment of stoppage benefit. The trade dispute in the Oldham district fortunately appears to be waning, and more mills are expected to restart. With regard to the engineering trade in this district, the periodical suspension of work people continues. One redeeming feature, however, in both the cotton and the engineering industries is that firms are resorting to short-time w6rking rather than to the discharge of workmen. The textile industry still remains depressed, with no present signs of recovery. Additional mills have closed in the Accrington, Blackburn, Darwen, New Mills and Glossop districts, and extended short time has been instituted at Horwich, Hyde, Nelson, Redcliffe, Reddish and Rochdale. Practically all firms are working less than normal hours. The same conditions prevail in the lace-making, hosiery and boot and shoe trades, although in the latter trade it is reported that some orders are being secured by Northampton manu-facturers as the result of the Shoe and Leather Fair.Industrial Developments. A large engineering firm at Loughborough, employing approximately 1,000 workpeople, have commenced further extensions on a large scale. The firm could easily find employment for 100 more workpeople if housing accommodation were forthcoming. Messrs. Marshall &amp; Palmers, Reading, a new firm, have been inquiring the number of cabinet makers and French polishers available, as they hope to-be in a position to commence business shortly.The Southampton Corporation are in communication with Messrs. Thos. W. Ward, Ltd., Sheffield, in regard to the purchase of the train ferry at Southampton. The firm propose to use the ferry in connection with the breaking up of warships, and it is estimated that the work would employ 300 unskilled workmen. The firm have also in preparation a ship-breaking scheme at Hayle, which, should relieve the unemployment situation in that area. Messrs. A. R. Atkey &amp; Co., Nottingham, agents for the Ford Motor Co., Ltd., are arranging to erect new works in the district as a repair centre for the Midlands. Folkestone report that a large contract at Shorncliffe will absorb about 200 men.Labour Reductions. At Shoreditch Messrs. H. Howell &amp; Co., Ltd., stick manufac-turers, are discharging 80 workpeople, and Messrs. Waterlow &amp; Sons, Ltd., printers, who employ over 2,000 workpeople, are considering the question of reducing their staff. A firm at Poplar have discharged 300 shipyard workers. The Grahame-White Aviation Co., Ltd., Hendon, have discharged 400 employees. The Shipbuilding Co., Ltd., Poole, have temporarily closed down, and 100 men are out of employment.At Moseley 70 men, mostly fitters and turners, have been discharged by Messrs. Brolt, Ltd., electrical engineers.  Messrs. Harper Bean, Ltd., Tipton, have discharged
1,500 men during the last two or three weeks. The chairman of Messrs. Steel, Peech &amp; Tozer, Ltd., Rotherham, has been interviewed in regard to the recent discharge of 1,300 men ; it is understood that there is very little prospect of the men being re-employed by the firm.Shortage of Labour. The situation in the building trades is practically unchanged, both in London and in the country as a whole. Owing to the increased cost of travelling, bricklayers are leaving jobs outside the district in which they reside in order to take on work nearer to their homes.The King&apos;s Cross Exchange have been requested by the Post Office to supply 1,500 men for Christmas work, the first batch being required by the 13th October.Despite the general prevalence of unemployment there is in some districts a marked shortage of key men, such as coremakers and moulders. The demand for coach trimmers, coach builders and quarry workers is also unsatisfied.Shortage of Material. In addition to the difficulties reported above, the ironfounding trade at Walsall is experiencing difficulty in obtaining supplies of raw material. Insuffi-cient supplies of building materials are reported from Southport and Croydon. At Enfield, the Edison Swan Electric Co., Ltd., are unable to obtain adequate supplies of porcelain. A shortage of granite is reported to be holding up road-making schemes in the Guildford district.womens Employment.General Industrial Situation. Reports received during the week show that a greater amount of short time is being organised in all the industrial Centres. The Exchange registers indicate that the number of unemployed workers is steadily increasing. As already indicated, the position of the textile industry in the North-Western Division is serious. Haslingden would appear to be the only district in which the industry is being steadily carried on, although a small number of Vacancies still exist for skilled weavers at Bolton, Bacup, Bury, Farnworth, Heywood, Stalybridge and Stockport.The position of the textile trade is also serious in the Yorkshire and East Midlands Division. Hebden Bridge and Shipley report that most of the local weaving sheds are closed, and increasing short time is being worked in Barnsley, Batley, Bradford, Brighouse, Dewsbury, Halifax, Huddersfield and Liversedge. At Todmorden, where trade has been particularly steady, short time has not yet been instituted. In Scotland, short-time working is reported to have been arranged in the textile areas of Alexandria, Cranston Hill, Alloa, Bridgeton and Dumfries. The jute trade of Dundee and the linen industry of Dunfermline continue to be seriously depressed.Women workers in the North-Western Division are reluctant to accept Avork in other districts, and difficulty is experienced in filling small demands for skilled canvas weavers at Newton Heath, French polishers at Oldham and experienced clothing machinists at Crewe.  Many silk textile workers have been suspended at Macclesfield, Leek and Braintree.The hosiery trade continues depressed, Derby, Ilkeston, Beeston, Mansfield, Nether-field, Loughborough, Leicester and Irvine being specially affected. Unemployment in the lace trade has increased during the week.The boot and shoe trade in the Midlands continues to be depressed, though Kettering firms have notified a few vacancies for highly skilled Workers. Leather workers have been discharged in many parts, particularly at Armley, Grantham, Otley, Northampton, Edin-burgh, and several districts in London. The gloVe-making industry at Yeovil remains steady. At Denton slackness in the felt hat trade has caused the temporary unemployment of 120 women workers.The wholesale clothing trade is still very quiet in all divisions. Slackness is reported at Glasgow, Castleford, Leeds, Halifax, Armley, Portsmouth, Bristol, Colchester, and in the London districts of East Ham, Edgware Road, Hackney, the Borough and Leyton.Many women have been discharged from factories engaged in motor and cycle manu-facture, particularly in the Birmingham, Handsworth, Coventry, Sparkhill and Netherfield districts. The demand for buffers and burnishers in the Sheffield cutlery trade remains unsatisfied. The tin-stamping works at Port Talbot have again discharged a small number of women.  Many tin box workers in the London area continue to be unemployed.All large cities report much unemployment among general factory workers. Confect-ionery work jis reviving in a few centres. Many laundry workers are still unemployed in London, especially at Acton, Brentford, Edgware Road and Holloway. ^Briskness is noted in soap manufacture at West Bromwich, The manufacture of rubber goods continues to be slack.
Agricultural. It is hoped that a large number of unskilled workers will continue to be absorbed in seasonal agricultural work. Scotland report a demand for women for potato-lifting in the districts of Edinburgh, Aberdeen, Dumfries and Dunfermline, but work has not yet started owing to the recent rainfall. Chesterfield and Retford also report a seasonal demand for potato-lifters. At Letchworth many applicants are at present collecting dandelion roots for a manufacturing chemist at Hitchin.LOCAL EMPLOYMENT COMMITTEES.&quot;s.Activities of Committees.Employment and Resettlement. The provision of State-aided schemes to alleviate unemployment has been discussed by the Stroud Committee, who agreed to support the Bristol resolution calling for a national conference with a view to placing the unemployment situation before the Prime Minister. The Brixton Committee have requested the Lambeth and the Wandsworth Borough Councils to consider what steps can be taken locally to find employment, either by way of relief work or otherwise, for the large number of unemployed workpeople in the district.Out-of-Work Donation and Unemployment Insurance. The Crewe Committee have passed a resolution that the benefits to be paid under the new Act in the cases of married men, widows with families to support, and single girls with dependants, are insufficient, in view of the high cost of living and the prospect of abnormal unemployment.Ex-Service Men. A list was submitted to the Crewe Committee containing particulars of 8 disabled ex-Service men who are at present on the Crewe disabled register. On the department&apos;s suggestion that the list be sent with a circular letter to employers of over 25 workpeople, the committee resolved that the list be not circulated, as the men were in receipt of high disability pensions. They were of opinion that men assessed at 50 per cent, disability or over are not capable of following continuous employment, and should be placed on.full disability pension, or should have work provided for them by the State.The Hereford Committee have decided to recommend that action should be taken to ensure that firms on the National Roll are carrying out their obligations. The secretary of the Stourbridge Committee reported that most local authorities in the area had agreed to the principle of including the National Scheme in the &quot; fair contracts &quot; clause, and had themselves given undertakings under the scheme.Miscellaneous. The London Building Trades Committee direct the Ministers attention to the shortage of -cement, which is seriously retarding building and constructional work, and press for the speeding up of manufacture.OUT-OF-WORK DONATION.Payments Made. Returns by the Finance Department, according to information received at the Claims and Record Office, Kew, for the week ending the 7th October, show 169,660 payments to policy holders involving an amount of  173,846 15s. 2d. The total amount disbursed to date is  55,851,555.UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE.Payments Made. The number of payments of unemployment insurance benefit made during the week ending the let October was 47,965, involving an amount of  25,704 6s. 8d.DISCHARGED AND DISABLED SAILORS AND SOLDIERS.National Scheme.Up to and including the 13th October, 21,526 certificates had been issued to employers enrolled under the Scheme. The undertakings given by these employers cover 230,205 disabled ex-Service men.Local Employment Committees will, in future, send fortnightly to all employers of 25 or more workpeople a list of the unemployed disabled ex-Service men in the district.The Mayor of Rotherham intends to interview personally the heads of the more important firms in his area, with a view to the more rapid absorption of disabled men.
v.APPOINTMENTS AND TRAINING.APPOINTMENTS AND CIVIL LIABILITIES DEPARTMENT.APPOINTMENTS.Statistics.-During the week ending the 8th October, the Appointments Department placed 522 candidates for appointments, bringing the total &quot;number of candidates known to have been placed to 42,358. Of these, 5,749 were placed through the agency of the department^ Interviewing Boards. Applications were registered from 834 ex-Service men and 32 civilians. The total of candidates available for appointments on that date was 11,669 ex-Service men and 1,614 civilians. At the same date .1,306 &quot; live &quot; vacancies were at the disposal of the department, 610 having been registered during the week.BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONAL TRAINING.Maintenance and Training Grants Scheme. During the week ending the 8th October the Appointments Department received applications for training under this scheme from 153 ex-officers and men of equal educational qualifications, of which 79 were for training of the type provided by the department. Deducting cancellations and withdrawals 28,344 applications for training of this latter type have been received in all, and 50,475JUVENILE BRANCH.Juvenile Employment Committees.Juvenile Workers: Two Day-Shift System. The retention of the two day-shift system for juvenile workers has now been considered by 42 Juvenile Employment Com-mittees, 25 of whom have expressed the opinion that the system is undesirable. The Ashton-under-Lyne, Bristol and Rotherham Committees are opposed to the employment of juveniles under 16 years of age- on the two-shift system. The South Shields Committee hold that it is undesirable for young persons to start work earlier than 7 a.m., or to remain at work later than 8 p.m. Only six committees, Barnsley, Brighton, Grays, Grimsby, Nottingham and Tiverton, feel that, under proper safeguards, the system should be allowed to continue.  Pour committees have not yet reached a definite conclusion.Street Trading. The Ashton-under-Lyne and District Juvenile Advisory Committee have written to the various education authorities in their area asking them to withhold the issue of licences for street trading to boys and girls until they have proved, by applica-tion to the committee, that they are unable to obtain better employment.Apprenticeship : Building Trades-kt Folkestone and Kings Lynn, conferences have been held between the Juvenile Employment Committees and representatives of the employers and workpeople, to consider the scheme prepared by the Joint Industrial Council. At Swansea, where the representatives of employers and workpeople had previously been unable to agree as to wages and the ratio of apprentices to journeymen, the Juvenile Employment Committee have succeeded in re-opening the question on the basis of the Joint Industrial CounciPs scheme, and both sides have agreed to the estab-lishment of a Building Trades Apprenticeship Committee. The Ashton-under-Lyne and Ipswich Committees are convening conferences to consider the adoption of a scheme. In the latter town the president of the masters builders&apos; association has expressed approval of the national scheme. A report from Barnsley shows that, although the Juvenile Employ-ment Committee have made every effort to discuss the scheme with the employers&apos; associa-tion, the association have failed to show any interest in the matter.Errand Boys. The Ilkeston. Juvenile Employment Committee have decided to ask employers engaging errand boys to notify the Exchange when the boys leave. In this way it is hoped to keep in touch with the boys and assist them in obtaining more permanent employment.[Reference to matters of interest to the Employment and Insurance Department will also be found on pages 478 to 482, 490, 491, 493 and 500.]
Appointments and Training-continued.for training of the types provided by other Government departments. The Interviewing Boards have dealt to date with 27,183 applications, of which 22,834 have been recom-mended. The Grants Committee, dealing with applications so recommended,&apos; have received 21,612 applications and sanctioned grants in 17,826 cases.Training of Disabled Officers under Pensions Warrant. The Appointments Depart-ment have dealt with a total of 864 cases, in 412 of which the training sanctioned is provided by the Appointments Department and in the remainder by other Government departments. Candidates accepted by the Ministry of Labour have completed their training in 212 cases and abandoned training in 39 ; 141 are still in training and 20 are awaiting training.TRAINING DEPARTMENT. INDUSTRIAL TRAINING.Disabled and Other Ex-Service Men.Statistical.-On the 13th October, 25,083 men were in training, as against 25,049 on the 6th October, and 24,798 on the 15th September. There were 17,219 men awaiting training, the corresponding totals for the 6th October and the 15th September being 17,326 and 19,597, respectively. - The number of men whose training had been completed since the 1st August, 1919, was 18,085, the totals for the 6th October and the 15th September being 17,744 and 16,422, respectively. The statistics for the week, in the case of one or two divisions, are based on figures recently revised and slightly modified. While it would be unwise to attempt to generalise from a single weekly return, it is possible that restrictions on admissions in certain trades and difficulties in obtaining improvers&apos; vacancies, due to the uncertainty of trade outlook, are reflected in the falling off: in the number of terminations, and in the practically stationary position of the number of men in training.Hostels. There are now 424 men in residence in the hostels carried on under the direction of the Ministry, and 60 per cent, of the accommodation is fully utilised. In addition there are over 400 men in residence at*Sarisbury Court, and about 50 at Claydon, the two residential factories now open. The Ministry are therefore responsible for the housing of approximately 900 men.Government Instructional factories. There are now 49 institutions of the factory type at work. The number of men in factory training increased from 1,138 on the 14th October, .1919, to 6,696 on the 28th September, 1920.A beginning has at last been made with factory training in the South-Eastern Division, where 10 men are at work in the carpentry and joinery section of the Guildford Factory. The Wimbledon Factory is due to open on the 20th October.The principal of the Woodhouse Lane Factory, Leeds, reports very satisfactory results from the training of draughtsmen in his engineering drawing office. The men have found employment rapidly, and only one man is now left in training. One, who was placed with one of the largest and oldest engineering firms in Leeds, has shown such ability that the management have decided to give him an opportunity of taking a university course.Equipment and Supplies. Fairly large quantities of all types of tools for the building and woodworking trades, with the exception of plumbers&apos; tools, have been delivered to Central Stores during the week. Financial sanction for the bulk purchase of upholsterers&apos; tool-kits has been requested.Apprenticeships Interrupted by Service.Statistics. Up to the 13th October, 41 schemes had been approved. The number of applications received at Exchanges from employers for apprentices, for the week ending the 4th October, was 1,009, making a total of 45,781. The number of applications received from apprentices was 1,168, making a total of 51,523.Up to the 15th October, agreements had been received at headquarters in respect of 44,025 apprentices. Grants had been sanctioned in respect of 41,827 apprentices, employed by 16,496 employers. The total number of agreements lapsed on the expiration of the appropriate period of training, or by mutual agreement between the parties, is now 11,816.Period of Renewed Training. In the London and South-Eastern area, two firms in the horological industry are finding the time allowed to their apprentices under the scheme to be sufficient only to train them in the rougher classes of work, and quite inadequate to make them highly skilled workmen, capable of commanding full rates.
Applications. Further reports have been received in regard to &quot; unmated &quot; appren-tices, who cannot find employers under the scheme. In several districts in the London and South-Eastern area, at Ashton-under-Lyne, and at Grantham, there are now no apprentices in this position. Several difficult cases have been satisfactorily settled by local headquarters in the Northern and Yorkshire areas.At Perth efforts are being made to provide for the outstanding applications, of which there are only about a dozen ; 110 apprentices have already been brought under the scheme in the district. The Local Employment Committee are reported to be highly pleased with their success, as difficulties have been experienced in this area, especially with engineer-ing and building firms. tAt Poole the outlook in engineering and shipbuilding is especially unpromising. Every firm has been circulated four times for vacancies without success.Acceptance or Non-Acceptance. During September, in view of complaints regarding failures by engineering firms to adopt the scheme, the Engineering Employers&apos; Federation drew the attention of their members to their decision that all firms should adopt the scheme in every case in which it is applicable. Messrs. Alfred Herbert, Ltd., Coventry, engineers, have not adopted the scheme in any case, preferring to put the apprentices upon the premium bonus system, under which they earn good wages, and &quot;are a much better business proposition &quot; to the employer.Termination of Agreements. Messrs. Boulton &amp; Co., Ltd., Hanley, engineers, have refused to carry out the decision of the Local Employment Committee that a dismissed apprentice should be reinstated. They alleged that he was practically a beginner who ought never to have been brought under the scheme. The committee, therefore, awarded the apprentice  50 compensation, terminated the agreement and suggested that a new employer be found to accept the apprentice.Apprentices and Boys: General Training.Engineering Training. A committee, appointed by the Council of the Institution of Engineers and Shipbuilders in Scotland to inquire into this subject, recommend (i) that boys enter the employment of the firm with whom they will train on leaving school, and that apprenticeships in Scotland start at 15 years, not 16 ; (ii) that a simple agreement or indenture be adopted, and proper &quot; lines &quot; issued at the end of apprenticeship ; (in) that apprenticeships be normally for 5 years, but that a 3 years&apos; apprenticeship be recognised for certain machine operators and semi-skilled workers ; (iv) that employers provide definite courses of instruction in each trade, including transfer to different branches of work; (v) that in large firms boys go first to a special department, till they reach an agreed, standard; and (vi) that apprentice supervisors, of good education and high character, be appointed to superintend training. As regards technical and continuation classes, the committee recommend that part, at least, of day-class instruction be given after working hours.Apprenticeship : Building Industry. The national scheme has been approved by the master builders&apos; associations at Cardiff and Llanelly, and by the Chester branch of the operatives&apos; federation. The federation, however, consider that, after a full day&apos;s work a boy ought not to be, asked to attend evening classes. At Hull, builders criticise existing classes for attempting to teach the practical side of the work, instead of confining them-selves to such subjects as the theory of building construction, mathematics and drawing. They are refusing to take apprentices at present owing to objections to the wage scale of the Yorkshire Joint Council. At Doncaster, apprentices are unobtainable, and wages in the coal mines are such that even the adoption of the scale of :the national scheme will hardly improve matters.[Reference to matters of interest to the Appointments and Training Departments will also be found on pages 481, 484, 497 and 498.]
