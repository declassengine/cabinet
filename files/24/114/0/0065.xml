OMTOATM    1.      Th^XhAlrma-^^ .....that- at theirtfJAMENT.        l^al^feebtng he had n.&apos;     taker to submit one or two(f questions to the Cabinet whioh the Committee hod felt it was not within their competence to decide.   Thefirst was raised by the action which had been taken in bothHouses of Parliament by Members voluntarily waiving any claim they might possess to preferential treatment Inrespect cf accommodation In the Abbey and near theCenotaoh.     The Cabinet view had been that no provision should be made for Members of Parliament as a &quot;class&apos;8,but that some accommodation should be provided in theAbbey for those Members who had lost a son or nearrelative in the war.   Consequently, a certain number ofMembers of both Houses would have seats in the Abbey,but no provision need be made for them near the Cenotaph.The Committee decided:-To recommend that an Identical statement should be made the following day by Leaders In both Houses to the effect that in view of the waiving of claim to which Members of both Houses had so readily assented, it had been decided to confine admission to the ceremony of Interment of the Unknown Warrior in the Abbey on November 11th to such Peers and Members of Parliament as have lost a son or brother in the War.   For their accommodation the Dean and Chapter of . Westminster have kindly consented to set aside 200 seats in the Choir of the Abbey. Any Peer/&apos;M.?* who belongs to the above category and desires to oe present. Is invited to apply to the Lord Chancellor&apos;s/ Mr. Speaker&apos;s Secretary not later than Saturday morning with a statement of claim.     If the number of claims is in excess of the total accommodation, the seats will be ballotted for.ISTION OF KING THF , uION OH IN NAVE.8.The Chairman informed the Committee that the viewof the Cabinet was/that the bereaved were more deserving of consideration,In respect of accommodation in the Nave, than those who had taken part in the procession and had consequently been present at the Service of the Cenotaphs
The Cabinet were anxious, however, to preserve, as faras possible, the military character of the AbbeyCeremony by having some 50 to 100 of representativesof all ranks of tho Army in the Nave,     He invited theviews of Members of the Committee on this proposal.   he added that there was a very strong feeling in the that cabinet/fit the last scene in the Abbey, the private soldier should be prominent.A discussion then followed when various proposals were put forward viz,, that the 800 officers and men forming the Procession should ballot for 100 places and march at the head of the Procession* where they would be conveniently placed in order to enter the Abbey.   This, however, was found to be impossible.   An alternative proposal was, that 100 representatives of various Fighting Units of the three lighting Services should be chosen by some other process than ballot, and should be already in the Abbey awaiting the arrival of the Funeral Procession. In regard to this, it was pointed out that there were considerably more than 100 Units to be represented, and that disappointment would be caused if any Units were omitted.The Committee finally decided to recommend to the Cabinet:-(a) That the 800 representatives of the Fighting services, forming part of the Procession, should not enter the Abbey as had been originally intended, but on reaching the Abbey entrance should follow the Massed Bands and be dispersed as the military Authorities might decide,(b) That seating accommodation in the Have should be provided for 410 relatives of the fallen, their places being allotted by ballot,(c) That 100 representatives of the three Fighting Services, who had taken part in the war, should be present in the Nave by 10 a.m., and should face inwards, thus forming a lane down which the   -Funeral Procession would pass,(d) That the selection of these 100 men, who should be in uniform- should be left to the three Fighting Departments, preference being accorded to those of all ranks who had. most distinguished themselves by th.lr valour *

The Committee were reminded that their original THE BEREAVEDTHE TWO intention had been,that accommodation for relatives ofJMONIBS.the fallen,in the Abbey and at Government windows near the Cenotaph,should be restricted to female relatives. .   &apos; It was pointed out that, in view of the great emotionalstrain under ynich the relatives would be suffering, prior to and during the two Services, it was desirable, for this and for other reasons, that a certain number of bereaved fatViers and male relatives should also be admitted to the Abbey, the Abbey Lawn, and the pavements near the Cenotaph-The Committee agreed(a) That male as well as female relatives should be admitted to the Abbey, the Abbey Lawn and the pavements on each side of the Cenotaph.(b) That seats in Government windows should be restricted to female relatives only.The Committee took note that, under the arrange-ments now contemplated, accommodation for the bereavedwould be available to the following extents-400 male and female relatives in the Nave of the Abbey.300 male and female relatives in the South Transeptof the Abbey. SCO male and female relatives on the Abbey Lawn, Nr. St. Margaret^ Church. 2,000 male and female relatives on the pavementeast of the Cenotaph. 1,000 male and female relatives on the pavementwest of the Cenotaph. 1,500 female relatives in Government Offices.Making a total of some 5,400 in a11*
The C omit be e - de c tde d: -(a) That,after the ballot to held., at 12 noon on Friday, the 5th instant, at the Office of Works, tickets should be sent to the female relatives who were successful In the ballot.(b) That the public should be Informed, through the Press, that, if any female relative receiving a ticket was unable, for any reason, to make use of it, she would befit liberty to hand it over to some close relative of the deceased, of her own family, e.g. father, daughter or son.The Committee were aware that this power oftransference opened up possibilities of fraud, and agreed:-That an appeal should be made,, through the medium of the Presss, to the good feeling of the public to see that the privilege of special accommodation should not be abused*[EARING OF 4i      Th* Committee were informed that His MajestyIt URGING.would wear family mourning on November 11th, and thatthe Pall-bearers would also be wearing mourningsIt was &quot;decided:-That officers and other ranks of the three Fighting Services forming part of the Procession; or attending at the Cenetaph, or present in the Nave, should not wear mourning.Question of Uniform.,    With reference to the pre vie us decision of the Committee, In pursuance of the King&apos;a desire, that all representatives of the Fighting Forces should wear Service uniform, i.e. Kha&amp;I, Sir Douglas Dawson undertook to give early notice to the three Fighting Departments to to whether troops should wear their cloaks or not.pTLEMEN-AT-      5.

TheSecretary of State for India had stated that he wouldbe glad if one representative of each of these religionscould be present at the Cenotaph, as he understood thatcertain Indian Princes now in England would be there..The Committee decided;-That the India Office should be asked to invite one Hindu driest and one MahomedanPriest to be present at the Cenotaph, and .to inform them that places would be reservedfor them on the steps of the Home bfficeand; further, that they might join the precessionfrom the Cenotaph to the Abbey or not asthey desired,:;cess to fwotaph for *binet am) ex-cabinet-ihsters.-UTILITIES FOR IS MAT A GRAPH ORATORS.7*      The Committee had under consideration the questionof arranging for convenient access to the Cenotaph forthe Cabinet and ex-Cabinet Ministers, who might beInvited to be present.In the absence of the Chief Commissioner&apos; of thePolice, the Committee agreed:-That the question should be remitted for the consideration of the Sub-Committee *8,      The Committee agreed:-.That it was most undesirable that any cinema.tagraph operators should be in the immediate vicinity of the Cenotaph; and that they should be excluded from the Abb ey *

The Committee had under consideration the questionof the position of the Archbishop of Canterbury andthe Bishop of London, and other Church dignitaries inthe Procession from the Cenotaph to the Abbey.The Dean of Westminster entered a strong protest against the Head of the Jewish Religion in England,and Indian Priests marching with the Heads of the church of England.The Committee decidedThat the first part of the Procession as . it leaves the Cenotaph on route for the Abbey, should bo formed as under:-Massed bands, Archbishop of Canterbury, Bishop of London,Heads of other British Religious denominations, The gun-carriage. .ITION OF 10.
