Clear the line.2921. Your telegram of 20th October, 1210, and connected correspondence&apos;&apos;. Afghanistan. His Majesty&apos;s Government agree that necessary preliminary&apos; to resumption of negotiations with Afghans must be to obtain, from Amir clear statement of his position vis-a-vis Bolsheviks. Pending reliable information on this point no final decision as to future policy is possible. But in one respect His, Majesty&apos;s Government wish to make their position quite clear at once. They agree that mere existence of friendly relations between Afghans and Bolsheviks need not necessarily preclude our coming to terms with former, but no purpose is served by pretending to accept plea of: Bolshevik help in developing Afghanistan when it is . matter of. common knowledge that Bolshevik policy is solely inspired by desire to damage us.If, therefore, it should prove that Afghans have actually concluded and do not repudiate agreement with Bolsheviks on lines indicated by evidence at present at our&apos; disposal, we could not possibly contemplate treaty of friendship with Amir involving renewal of his subsidy or grant of material assistance to Afghan Government. To do ) sp would be in effect to subsidise a movement openly aimed at destruction of British Empire.It remains to consider best means, of getting Amir to nut his cards on table. Following procedure is suggested : &quot; You should inform Amir in reply to his letter that His Majesty&apos;s Government were quite prepared to negotiate a treaty with him, and to send an envoy to Kabul for that purpose.   But they have recently been astonished, to hear that lie is alleged to have concluded a treaty with Bolsheviks on terms that can only be regarded as directed against Great Britain.   Actual terms as known to us from secret sources should be specifically enumerated in  letter, including subsidy on condition of consulates referred to in telegram from Chief of General Staff, India, to Director of Military Intelligence, No. 1727, of 6th October.   You should add that alleged&apos;; stipulations strike His Majesty&apos;s Government as so incredible, that they have thought&apos; it only fair to give Amir an immediate opportunity of repudiating them.   This should be followed by request that if Amir has concluded any agreement with Bolsheviks :. he should inform you of exact terms in order that perfect loyalty may be observed between our two Governments.   In conclusion, you should intimate that until this : matter is cleared up, no useful purpose would-result from sending envoy to Kabul.&quot;Subject to any comments you may have to offer, you may address Amir at once on above lines.
