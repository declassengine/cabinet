Unfortunately, there i3 no solution of the problem and the palliatives will not go very far.   Naturally, propagandists are working hard among the unemployed and especially* among ex-soldiers.The third anniversary of the Bolshevik revolution was celebrated by an Albert Hall meeting&apos; attended by from 7,000 to 8,000 people, many of whom were Jews from the East End and of course not&quot;all British. As a consequence of the speech made by Mr lialone, M.P., he v/as arrested last night in Dublin; a search of his residence produced a large number of seditious papers, which are being examined; he will reach London at 6 p.m. to-day and will appear at 10 a.m. at Bow Street to-morrow.   The aotion taken in hie case has done something to allay the public indignation at what they thought was the apathy of the Government. there is now a majority of Labour Mayors in the London Boroughs and doubtless they will make themselves felt in respect of unemployment.The Post Office Union are balloting this week on the strike policy.   The ballot is intended to ratify the decision reached by the May conference.   The membership is about 120,000.Trotsky has heoome Hon.

TEE COMMEMORATION 01? TH&quot;3 RUSSIAN HEVOLOTCOBmss,V..I;On November - 7th a meeting to celebrate the third anniversary of the Bolshevik revolution was held in the Albert Hall, under the auspices of the Communist Party of Great Britain and-the national &quot;Hands off Russia&quot; Committee. The audionce which numbered between 7,000 and 8,000 consists principally of aliens, Jews, Sinn Seiners and degenerates. The stalls and lower seats were occupied by comparatively well dressed people, but there were many men of the hooligan ; type, presumably members of the National Union of Bx-Service Men, in the balcony.   The audience-was enthusiastic and gave the reception of the evening to ex-Colonel Malone. Robert Williams was frequently interrupted and hailed as a &quot;labour Fakir&quot; and a &quot;gasbag&quot;.  McManus was cautious and in his opening - remarks gavs the impression that if the oth3r speakers chose to &quot;take risks,-he had no intention of doing so.   Purcell worked himself in a state of great excitement, but confined hie speech chiefly to a eulogy of Russia.   His most interesting declaration was the statement ,/that Itossia was sending four and a half million roubles to *, Ireland for the use of Sinn-Fein.&apos; This sum may be the  300 mentioned as being in ?eltheimrs possession for that purpose, He had diverted it ig.t$ another channel&apos;, and this fact may account for 0&quot; Shannon&apos;s remark that Sinn Fein had not yet received the money. IBy far the most inflammatory speech was made by Malone, 1 and in view of the circumstances, particularly the effect of his remarks on the audience, his speech was deliberate incitement to assassination and revolution by foroe. The following are the more important passages:&quot;On Thursday next, November 11th, His.Majesty the ling is calling a-general strike in this country in order to commemorate the victory of one set ofImperialists/
*Ifc.perlAlijrtiu^ A victory which caused xurelief, whioh has caused no- advantage to any of the working class In any land of the whoJLe-world.   A victory which hasnmis^ooiserry^to millions of men women and children In the whole world.  A victory-has brought advantage only to a mere handful of profiteers %   If we are going to have a general strl^ let us not exploit the dead to advertise the man who boasts he won the war.   If we are going to have a general strike, let it he oalled not from Buckingham Palace, hut from the ranks of labour itself.   Let It he called not to celebrate Imperialism and War, hut to bring about Peace In this old world of ours.   If wo are going to have a strike, let it not be a strike to oelebrate Imperialism, but to bring down this structure of Capitalism.   The Russian Bolsheviks have passed through their darkest hours.   The Russian Bolsheviks can snap their fingers at that arch murdeil churchill, or the vile and unscrupulous intrigues of Lord Curs on of Kedleston.   Or the loathing, disgust!:1 ... of Mr., George,  let us learn one thing from the Russian Revolution.   Capitalism and Socialism can nei make peace either internationally or in this country, If the working class of this country are to obtain freedom, then Capitalism has got to be destroyed.  Do not fool yourselves that you are going to destroy Capitalism.  Do not fool yourselves that Capitalism is going to allow itself to be demobilised by putting a bit of paper in a ballot box.   The Russian Revoluti teaches us the humbug of the old Parliament.   Democra teaches us the my the Parliament is doping you through the Press and the Parliamentary Ballot Box, ! leave no stone unturned in your organising, in prepare  for the Social Revolution.   The day is not far distair when I hope we shall not meet in this Hall merely to pass resolutions on behalf of the Russian revolution, I hope the day will come soon when we can meet here to pass blessings on the British revolution,   When we meet here, not as idle spectators, but as delegates oi the first lAll British Congress of Workers, Sailors al Soldiers1 delegates1, when that day comes woe to all&apos; those people who get in our wayl  We are out to chan the present constitution, and if it is necessary to s bloodshed, td save atrocities, we shall have to use the lamp posts or the walls.   What, my friends, are a few Churchills or a few Curzons on lamp posts?  Whal are a few Churohills or Curxons on lamp posts comparel to the massacres of thousands of human beings?  What are a few Churchills or Curzons against the wall compared to tho bombing of the harmless Egyptians in Egypt? &amp;. o compared to the reprisals in Ireland?  What is the punishment of those world criminals compared to the misery which they are causing to thousands oi men and women.and little children in Soviet Russia? What wo,ild no the death of Char chill and Curzon? vrhat would m Lose by the disappearance of a few of those arolmge &apos;J.a of Capitalism compared with the Imperialist war?  Hak-a up your mind whether you are for the Capitalistic class with their scurvy agents George, ChurchillCurzon, Thomas, Henderson and Braoe.   Or whether you are with the Communist Party and the wort, clasa movement.   If you are with the working-olass movement, support the policy of the Communist Party. The Communist Party provides the only solution.   Thehope/
hope of the working-olasees in this country lies in Communism.    The hope of the working-classes of the whole world lies in the world revolution and the Communist Internationale.&quot;It has been decided to prosecute Malone, and theJolice have arrested him in Ireland for whioh he left onMonday.    In the meantime his flat was searched and alarge number of documents seized *    These are being examined.Robert Williams, when taunted with the inefficacy of the Counoil of Action, reminded the audience that they would be powerless if faoed by two men with a machine gun, adding &quot;Get hold of the machine guns and get hold of the plaoes where they are made.&quot;Cathal 0&apos;Shannon, who made a considerable impression on the audience, gave a vivid description of the manner in which women and children in Ireland were driven away from food at the point of the bayonet by Black and Tans.An interrupter was ejected during Malone&apos;s speech after a free fight, but there was no other opposition, apart from personal Reckling of Robert v/illiams.The first resolution pledged the meeting &quot;to do all in its power to follow the glorious example set by the Russian workers and to work steadfastly for the world-wide social revolution, while the second called upon the National Council of Action &quot;to send an ultimatum to the Government&quot; declaring that unless full peace were made with Russia by a specified date, the Counoil would call a national general strike.Meetings to celebrate the third anniversary of the Bolshevik revolution have been held in various parts of the country and the important point has been the presence thereat of many of the extremists who have recentlyvisited/
visited Russia, and are apparently anxious to show their Russian masters that they are rendering at least lip servioe for money received.   Documents were found on Veltheim giving details of communist finance and propaganda, including one item of  70 given to Tanner for &quot;Solidarity&quot;, and accounts for the British Red Army. Tanner, who spoke at Tottenham to an audienoe of 700, admitted that the conditions prevailing in Russia &quot;are not what one would expect in a heaven upon earth ... the peasants are dissatisfied &quot;because although they send their produce to the towns, they do not receive sufficient return.&quot;Purcell spoke at Kentish Town Baths before going to the Albert Hall and Lansbury and Ben Turner addressed meetings ai Batley and Bradford.   Itf-lansbury was oarefuj, to say that we wanted a revolution, hut a revolution of mind and spirit first and foremost.   t)avid Ramsay addressed a series of meetings in South Wales during the week and W. McLaine gave an address on the Second Congress of the Third International at Newcastle on November 7th.W. Gallacher addressed a large meeting at Edinburgh on October 31st, describing in detail his journey to Russia and his experiences in that country.   He&apos;stated that he and Sylvia Pankhurst and Mrs.&quot;Crawford drove to the opera &quot;in the late Czar!3 motor car&quot; and that they and his companions &quot;occupied the Royal box.&quot;  Se was asked several searching questions by the audience. -Russia was also the subject of some of the speeches made at an Industrial Workers of the World meeting in Trafalgar Square1 on November 7th. &apos;In spite of these various meetings, Communists generally appear:to be depressed by the peaceful settlement . * of/
of the miners1 strike and the defeat of Labour at the Municipal Elections.   They are also really afraid of prosecution, especially in Coventry and Leicester, and curiously enough in Coventry Emery has lost influence since it became known that he is not legally married to the woman with whom he lives; she is an alien who was fined on October 1st for a breach of the Alien Regulations. In Leicester meetings are to be private and members are instructed to be discreet and not to talk of revolution to strangers.In Birmingham during the weok-end Emery addressed the unemployed. He was at some pains to explain that it would be: better policy to corrupt the Forces and the Police than to form a Red Army.As a result of the &quot;Mystery Man&quot; case there is talk among the London extremists about corruption.   Rumour has multiplied the amount of the funds received by the leaders, and many, including Malone, are beginning to be regarded with suspicion.The great effort of the Communists at this moment is to create a feeling of militancy among the unemployed.COUBOIIS OP action under the date November 8th Herbert Morrison, secretaryof the London Labour Party and D. Carmichael, secretaryof the London Trades Council, sent a circular letter,ttfor the information of the movement only&quot;, on.behalf of theLondon Council of Action to other local councils.   Thefollowing passages are of interest:&quot;It is a matter of universal agreement in the labour Movement that the Council of Aotion was thoroughly effective in preventing at the time of its creation an open commencement, of war on a large scale between the British Government and Soviet Russia.   Since that time exceedingly valuable work has/
has been performed by the Council of Action &apos; movement in gathering information and materially influencing international polloy%&quot;We understand that there.is no question as to the disbandment of the National Council of Action until the Russian question is satisfactorily settled, the intention being that the Council will continue to keep itself informed and to be in readiness for action should the need arise. ,&quot;In these circumstances, we suggest that, in the absai-joe of other instructions from the national Council, local Councils of Action should maintain their machinery in a similar state of preparation.. It is clear, of course, that the very great success of the National Council has created a situation in which it is no longer necessary for Councils to have frequent meetings or to engage in the intensive activity which was so necessary in the early days. The machinery has been created, and it must be maintained intact ready for work should the word cowl from the National Council.   This done, the Movement I should feel itself free for the ordinary work of &quot;ftaej Labour Party and Trade Unionism.   Naturally, the    &apos; 1 officers of the looal Councils will be alert in. forwarding to the National Council and ourselves alii information as to war movements, as previously.&quot;uTSfEMPIOYJJENTThe number of unemployed in the London area has more than doubled between September 1st and November 1st, and thf total for the whole country is nearly a million and a half. Agitators are taking full advantage of these facts, which oonstitute the most serious industrial problem.   Taken as a whole, the men are, at present, steady, but it-is unlikely that tliis condition will be maintained throughout the winte: as class hatred is fostered by unemployment being invariabl; laid at the door of the capitalist system.  Glaring comparis are drawn between the lot of the &quot;master class&quot; and that of the unemployed and meetings frequently terminate with the singing of the &quot;Red Flag&quot;, which the extremists intend shall replace the National Anthem.   Any unemployed demonstration is used as a means of propaganda against the Government andmen/
men are urged to join the National Union of Ex-Servioe Men and &quot;then make a powerful Red Army.&quot;   &quot;What/&quot; asked Maodonald of that Union at Tottenham recently, &quot;would have happened in the recent demonstration at Whitehall if all ex-Service men had &quot;been organised?  Would we have allowed the police to trample down our comrades like they did? Next time we go, we shall be ready for them and there will be a different tale to tell.&quot;   Asked about arms and ammunition, he replied, &quot;DQnft you worry, we know where to put our hands on that too.&quot;Jones stated recently that &quot;we are shortly going to organise a concerted line of action in West London, which will be done in each locality by its respective unemployed on a certain date at a given time.&quot;   This man is not trusted by other officials of the International Union of Ex-Service Men, who think he is a spy on the movement; there is a good deal of dissension among the self-appointed leaders.It is estimated that in Lancashire half a million workers are on short time.   34,030 looms are idle in Larwen and 4 spinning mills are on short time; 10,000 of the looms are idle   owing to trade depression and the remainder to the coal strike.   12,000 operatives are out of work end distress is very acute.   In Blackburn 38 mills were closed last week.   In most of the other towns in Lancashire the operatives are only working 24 hours a week.In Glasgow, John McLean and &quot;Sandy&quot; Ross are doing their utmost to incite the unemployed to disorder.THE OPAL MINERSWork has been resumed in practically all the pits in Great Britain, but there is considerable discontent inextremist/
extremist districts, notably South Wales, where agitators are busy urging the men to prepare for another strike within the next six or.seven months.   It is generally held by the Welsh miners that the Government has &quot;outwitted&quot;, the .miners leaders^ who are being widely and loudly abused.It seems clear that any reduction of wages would cause an immediate strike and it is essential-that&apos;the National Wage Board should cut the ground from under the extremists1 feet by immediate work on the permanent regulation of wages.Many of the miners1 associations are paying a second week&apos;s strike allowance and it is interesting to note that in Northumberland, the money, which had, to be obtained by the realisation of securities, will be paid entirely through the local co-operative stores.The.funds of the South Staffordshire and East Worcester-shire Miners1 Association -and-of the Warwickshire Miners&apos; Association are practically exhausted. -fIn Hamilton, where McLean and MoDougall have, been advocating sabotage and revolution, the extremist element attacked the offices of the Qounty Union on the afternoon of November 4th.   It.is interesting to note that the sight of about a dozen policemen with drawn batons caused the precipitate flight of 3ome 600 Red,hooligans, many of whom ran half a mile.before stopping.., In.the evening they returned broke into the premises and attacked the police with stones and brick3.   They were charged by the police, but,looted some shops.   Similar scenes occurred at BXantyre, and attempts were made at a repetition in Buraback; here,&apos; however, the older miners came to the assistance of the one policeman on duty.   There has, so far, been no recurrence of disorder in this district.MUNICIPAL/
&apos;. ;   493m      3     MMUNICIPAL ELECTIONSThe labour gains of 20 additional seats on the Glasgow City Council will scarcely add to the efficiency or equanimity of that &quot;body.   During the past year there have been frequent disorderly scenes and Labour members nonumber 44 as against 67 moderates.   The first sitting was marked by a heated debate on the election of a magistrate, Wheatley  moving that Dollan should be promoted on the principle of seniority.   Shinwell joined in the squabble and the Labour members threatened that they would never accept the decision of the Lord Provost or of the Council on any matter, indeed, they did not intend to pay the slightest heed to them.In Birmingham the communist candidate Shepperson obtained only about 300 votes and in Coventry P. H. Preece, who is locally described as the Socialist Labour Psrty &quot;fire eater&quot;, polled only 141 votes.   My correspondent states that the elections in the latter town were a &quot;severe shock&quot; to the extremists.   In Nottingham not a single Labour candidate was returned and the organisers are reported to.be &quot;struck dumb&quot; with disappointment.   In Leicester the Socialists gained one seat and lost two.   It is significant that in Newcastle the chairman of the local Lrbour party lost his seat on the Council.My Lancashire correspondent, who is exceptionallywell informed, sends the following report of the elections in his area:&quot;In Liverpool, Manchester, Stockport and wVJlasey, not a single Labour member was returned, but in Wigan, Leigh, 3;jlton (fining districts) and one or two other places they were a little more successful.)&quot;I have heard many Labour candidates during the week try to explain the cause of their defeat.Most/
Mont of them attribute it to the fact that trade is depressed and labour is blamed for it.   All the blame, they say, for strikes and lockouts has been laid on the labour movement which has been misrepresented as a Bolshevik movement and the workers have been frightened.&quot;The Lancashire workers as a whole are by no means satisfied with the way the country is boing governed and with the way the unemployment problem is being; tackled, yet they are getting tired of the Bob&apos;he&apos;vi3:: element in the Labour movement, who are always trying to incite them to revolt and continually telling them that the Parliamentary machine is played out and that the only cure for all &apos; the evils that afflict them is a strike, a general strike if possible, and then a revolution.   The workers in this area want constant work not strikes and they are not such big fools as the Bolshevik element takes them for,   They believe they can get all they require through the ballot box.   They do not want revolution and the smashing defeat of the Labour Party in Liverpool and in other towns is the Lancashire men and women1s way of showing that.&quot;If it was not for the Bolshevik element in the Labour Party, the election results would have been far different, beoause it is no use disguising the fact, that the strong vote for the Conservatives was not given because the Conservative Party is popular. It is because the workers in general are afraid of the dangerous element in the Labour Party who seem in a good many cases to have captured the labour Party machine.&quot;What the majority of the workers here &apos;can&apos;*t understand is why these extremists are allowed to preach revolution without any action being taken by the Government to punish  hem. *&quot;I stood amongst the thousands of working men and women assembled on St. George1 s Plate.Au on Monday ni/;;ht last when the results of the elections were being announced and every time a result was thrown on the screen which showed &quot;Labour&quot; had &quot;gemn down&quot; they cheered themselves hoarse.   2?rom taik3&apos;jf had with groups of men and woman I came to the conclusion that the vote was against the &quot;Bol3hies&quot; in the movement and not against the labour movement i;fcself\&quot;Of the 28 Metropolitan boroughs the following 15.have elected Labour mayors, Battersea, Be&apos;thnal Green,Camberweli, Leptford, Fulham, Greenwich, Hackney, Islington,Lambeth, Poplar, St. Pancras, Shored! tch, Southward, Stepneyand Woolwich.   14 Labour mayors appear to have been electedin the provinces.THE/
fygl t) 4iTHB PTOBProSBKT LA3QUB PARTYTho proposed new policy of the Independent labour Party which has been recommended for adoption by the National Administrative Council, has had a mixed reception; it embraces the substitution for Parliament of a National Assembly, decentralisation of local Government, communal ownership of land and capital, and direct action.The proposals are that the Independent Labour Party shall establish a system under which the community will own, organise and control all resources; land and capital are to be owned by the community and workers will control each industry and there is to be a National Assembly in place of Parliament,   Those are the ultimate objects,   For the immediate future the Party is to obtain a solidarity of Labour through the Trade Union organisation, to strengthen and expand the Co-operative movement and to capture the local and national Government bodies.   As the Party has not much confidence in the Parliamentary system it advocates recourse to direct action on certain occasions, and, as a corollary, a peaceful revolution.Only fourteen of the twenty members of the Polioy ^Committee signed the report.   Among the abstentions were Ramsay Macdonald, (Chairman), Clifford Allen, H. N. Brailsford, Prank Hodges, Tom Myers and Llargaret Bondfield.Although the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; finds the report a &quot;stimulating&quot; document, it has been severely criticised. The extremists complain that it does not go far enough, and the moderates, among whom are many vorkinb      with small holdings, declare that it goes much too far.The Bbcecutive Committee of the Second International met in London last week and issued a manifesto, strongly denouncing Bolshevism.SOCIALIST/
SOCIALIST SUNDAY SCHOOLSOn October 31st a service was held in the Trade Hall, Leicester, to dedicate four infants to the International Socialist Movement,   The oeremony was performed by a man named Minto, who taking each ohild in his arms repeated it name and said, &quot;You I dedicate to the International Socialist Movement, in the hope that you will grow up to work and fight in the cause of human emancipation, and the you and your children will know a better world than your father and grandfathers have known.&quot;   A bouquet of white flowers tied with red ribbon was then presented by a small scholar to each of the four babies and the song &quot;Hail to thee, ohild of Humanity&quot; was sung,TEE? INTERNATIONAL UNION Q? B3C-Si3RVICSi MENIt appears from a letter recently written to James Cox that Trotsky has become Hon. President of this Union.MERCHANT SEAMENThere is a revolt among the seamen on the S.S. &quot;Elbe1! against the leadership of Mr. Havelock Wilson. A sort of circular letter has been sent out by these men to be f passed round the boats of the British and Irish Steamship&quot; Co., and other boats at Dublin. They apparently want aa immediate increase of wages and to run the affairs of the Union themselves,GEORGE NICHOLSONGeorge Nicholson, who has for a considerable period been the associate of the hooligans and aliens who frequei the International Socialist Club and was at one time engaJI II
THE &quot;DAILY HERALD&quot;According to the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; of November Bth the Manchester meeting was rich in promises to procure from Trade Unions the money necessary to start a Northern edition of the paper..  Some  00 delegates were present and pledged themselves to consult their organisations, in order that fhe. necessary funds-should be provided from general funds or by levy. IErnest Bevin stated that suitable premises wereavailable/in the formation of a Red Army, has renounced, in print, his. revolutionary sympathies.   With a degree of effrontery which is astonishing even in a rascal of this type, he declared in a letter published recently by the &quot;Morning; Post&quot;:&quot;After much study of and belief in the Socialistic philosophy, I have concluded that any . attempt to apply it by force can result only in fia:3oo.   The revolutionary fails to realise that the essential to successful revolt really obviates the necessity for bloody rebellion, inasmuch as the mass of the people having revolutionised its mind the needs for extreme measures have largely disappeared. This cannot be said of society to-day, and therefore it may be assumed that any attempt at the assumption by force of the control of industry on the part of the workers would immediately bring about violent conflict and fail under bloody and primitive suppression.&quot;Bussia has taught us that, at any rste in the present state of civilisation, only a semblance of oommunism can be applied to human beings, and then only by-vigorous&quot;and forceful discipline.   I am therefore opus trained not only not to lend my support to the revolutionary faction, but to oppose henceforth by every maans the machinations of those who form the forces of destruction.&quot;Capitalism itself Is the best instrument to the hand of progress.   It will either -justify itself or destroy itself in process of intensification.   It is clear that if the whole of Europe went &quot;Red&quot; it would surely place itself at the mercy&apos; of Asia and the Now World, upon whom it is dependent for foodstuffs and those who advocate such a policy for the citizens of Britain are surely aiming at, the subjugation of - the Empire rather than the emancipation&apos;of the people.&quot;
available in Manchester, at a cost of about  46,000 and that the installation of essential machinery would entail a further expenditure of roughly  20,000.   It was proposed to enter into an arrangement with the national labour Presal Ltd., whereby they would occupy the greater part of the premises, entering into an agreement to print the Northernmmedition of the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;.   Bovin further stated that* 1something like  100,000 would be needed as working capital.!He added that the buildings would afford a collateral security for the money invested in their purchase but omitted to state the security for the  100,000.A subsequent conference between the directors of the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; and &quot;as many members of the Trades Union     I Committee as could be got together&quot; decided to pay a deposit!on the premises; it would appear, therefore, that money froiilIsome source is expected to be forthcoming.SINN FEIN IN OBEAT  hiTAINIThe Irish Self-Determination League have held several meetings in the London area, but nothing- of interest transpired.   The opinion is held that the Lord Mayor of Corkj is more use to the movement dead than alive.father Cronin is active in South V/ales and a meeting of! 400 people at Cardiff passed a resolution protesting &quot;against the savage acts of brutality carried out. by the servants of the Crown, apparently with the sanction of the British Government.   On November 6th an Independent Labour Party meeting at Preston,was addressed by Mrs. Watts, on &quot;the truth about Ireland by one who has been there.&quot;The Orange Rooms, at 193, Cowcaddens Street, Glasgow, were raided during the week and arms, ammunition and money stolen.   On the wall an inscription was left &quot;Commandeeredfor/
extremists. Any weakening or relaxation on the question of the carriage of munitions, would have a most disastrous effect.It is reported that the Railway employees in Berry have applied for re-inetatement, guaranteeing to work all classes of traffic in future.for the Irish Republican Army&quot;, and Orange regalia was stolen. A jemmy was used to effect an entry and it is thought that Sinn Seiners committed the outrage.On November 3rd a detachment of Irish volunteers, about 100 strong, is reported to have been engaged in sham battle manoeuvres at Carmunock.   Molestation of pedestrians by Sinn Feiners is still occurring.Some 15,00J Sinn Peiners attended the requiem mass for McSwiney at St. Andrew&apos;s Cathedral.ireland there has been an increase in the activity of extremists in the South and V/est and although the number of outrages reported,  05, shows a decrease, many were of a particularly serious nature. 12 policemen were killed and So wounded, an increase on the previous week of 7 and 21 respectively,   These attacks were due to efforts to revenge the deaths of Alderman McSwiney and Kevin Barry.   Numbers of Sinn Feiners were killed and wounded, and there is evidence that the pressure is hara3sin  the leaders, who are finding it more and more difficult to carry on their organisation. IThe Jianna or Sinn I?ein Boy Scout movement appears to be gaining strength, owin^ possibly to the fact that it has not been  li hproclaimed.   It is believed that many members who are over the . a$e of 18 are remaining in the organisation. IThe projected closing of the railways is bound to have a far g reaching effect.   Already the farmers are feeling the pinch of the restricted service, and it is possible that labourers and farmers will revolt against tne tyranny of Sinn Fein and Labour
