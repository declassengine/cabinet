WOBXBBS1   .0QBJPHOI   XII   BAOEOKIBS,   IB ;PROPOSES   ItDGISLAglOH.In consequence of a &quot;stay-in&quot; strike of metalworkers which &quot;began in August a general lockout in the metal industry was de-clared by the employers on 2nd September,    he Metalworkers1 federation at once ordered the men to seize all metal works throughout the country.   This they proceeded to do without meeting with any opposition.   The workers endeavoured to induce the technical and administrative staffs to join them and in some few cases were successful.    Works Councils were appointed to maintain order and organise work, to distribute raw materials and organise sales.   Other works were invaded in order to pro-cure materials for those already occupied.   Every effort was made to maintain output and the workers claimed that work pro-ceeded normally;   the employers however asserted that no work at all was being done.On 10th September the National Council of the General Con-federation of Labour met at Milan and decided that the supreme control of the movement should be entrusted to that &quot;body with the object of compelling employers to recognise the principle of trade union control of the works.   The Council also decided that the movement should be confined to the metal industry;   but in spite of this decision a number of establishments in other industries in Milan, Turin and elsewhere, were seized by the workers *On 15th September, Signor Giolitti arranged a conference with representatives of the C.G.L. and of the (Employers&quot;) confederation-tion of Industry.    The discuseiod^as adjourned without any definite agreement being reached, but immediately afterwards Signor Giolitti issued a Deoree appointing a joint committee of workers and employers to formulate proposals to assist the
Government in drafting a Bill to reorganise industries on the basis of the workers1 participation in technical and financial control and in the administration of the works.   rJ?he employers submitted to this Decree, thus conceding the principle of workers1 share in control, though under protest and subject to conditions.The final negotiations in regard to the metal-workers1 dispute took plaoe in Rome where an economic agreement was signed on 19th September,   This agreement was confirmed by a referendum among the workers and the works were evacuated on 27th September and following days.A few days later it was reported that the Metalworkers1 federation was reoeiving proposals from many employers with a view to converting their establishments into workers1 co-operative undertakings.   Signor Agnelli of the P.X.A.T, (motor works] Company began negotiations with the workers1 organisa-tions, declaring that the victory of the metal-workers made it impossible for the firm to carry on,    The Metalworkers1 federation, however, refused the offer.   On 6th October, Signor Agnelli and other administrators of the F.I.A.T. resigned their posts because of the attitude of the workers which made conditions in the works impossible.   At the end of Ootober a general meeting of shareholders of the Company was held and a motion passed expressing approval of the attitude of Signor Agnelli and his colleagues but refusing to accept their resignations.The joint committee appointed under Signer Giolittiss Decree began its sittings at Milan on 21st October.   Draft schemes for the application of workers1 &quot;control&quot; were submitted for discussion by both parties, and also draft regulations for engaging and discharging workers.   Details of the discussion have not been published, but the negotiations broke down on the question of workers1 control over the engagement and discharge of staff.
On 5th November the workers1 representatives made a statement to the effect that it was useless to oontinue the discussion as they oould not admit the absolute right of the employer to dismiss workers where there was ground for supposing that the dismissal was due to reasons other than industrial.    The employers1 representatives pointed out that agreement had been reached on several points (engagement of workers through ^oint Employment Exchanges, oompulsory introduotion of short time before discharging workers, right of workers to demand explanations in regard to dismissals).I^other meetings of the committee Sailed to result in agreement on a single soheme for &quot;control&quot;, and it was deoided that two separate schemes should be submitted to the Chamber, with whom the final decision would thus reste   It does not appear that the Bill has yet been drafted.
