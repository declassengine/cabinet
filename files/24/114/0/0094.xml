TRADE IN THE BLACK SEA.

Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty.

?binet. ? (20)

1. The Cabinet decided on November 3rd 1920 (Conclusion 5) that further explanations should be obtained from the Admiralty of the policy which is being pursued in regard to the limitation of traffic in the Black Sea.

2. The Admiralty policy is based on instructions issued by the Supreme Blockade Council to the Allied Naval authorities in Constantinople.

?reign ?ffice Circu? Telegram ? 22nd ? arch 1919.

"Supreme Blackade Council at Paris have decided to allow resumption of trade between Turkey, Bulgaria and Black Sea ports and all Allied and neutral countries subject to the following conditions:- Allied Naval Authorities in Constantinople will examine manifests of all vessels neutral or allied, destined for Constantinople and Black Sea, and will take steps to prevent unloading and transit of prohibited merchandise (for which see list in my Circular B. of March 22nd).

Allied Naval and Military Authorities in Constantinople are drawing up list of ports in Black and Azov Seas to which all trade may have to be forbidde?. Control of prohibited merchandise traffic on coast of Asia Minor and on Bulgarian coast of  Mediterranean will be exercised by local Allied Naval authorities."

3. These orders have been modified from time to time to meet the changing situation. The Admiralty Instructions which were issued in May 192?, are as fellows:-

Confidential Admiralty Monthly Order No. 896.

"The Allied Governments have authorised, with certain reservations, the resumption of trade with all existing enemy countries, and with Bolshevik Russia (through Co-operative Societies.)

2. Vessels are now permitted to sail freely to and from these countries, except that -

(a) As stipulated in Article 23 of the Terms of the Armistice with Turkey, that country is required to cease all relations with the Central Powers; and

(b) In view of the present uncertain military situation in the Black Sea, the Allied Naval Authorities at Constantinople have discretionary powers as to the ships and cargoes they may permit to proceed to Russian Black Sea ports.

Tho control of inpcrto into onomy ocmrtnriea isaxoroisod by the J/xjel AMlod Kcrvt^Trnthorittas at ports of diac^arg^ f or at OrtlFtejntinople an ro^gard-S vessels bound for destinations in tho Black Sea,4*     Any ye scoria wuspooted cf carrying urns and munitions consigned to tho Russian Soviet Government er its Agents is to &quot;be searched and, if necessary, sent for further orders to a port bolonging to, or in the occupation of, tho Allied or Associated powers.4,     Tho CorciJiander-in-Ohinf, Mediterranean, in reply to a recent question from the Admiralty as to what measures areaotually in eporation, replied on November 8th, as follows&quot;All trade from Constantinople to ports in Black Sea is controlled by Allied Captains of port noting under orders of Allied Admirals. Trade with ports in Bolshevik hands has been prohibited by Allied Admirals consistent with O.M.C. 396/2&apos;), for following reasonsDanger to ships concerned owing to mines off Bolshevik ports and to past (practices?) of Bolsheviks in endeavouring to seise or detain ships necessitating despatch of warships to ensure roloase undor threats; list traffic in arms which already exists would increase to alarming proportions if free (trade?) was allowed between Turkish and ? Bolshevik pvjrts. Trade with ports other than Bolshevik is often prohibited or restricted when local conditions render safety of ships doubtful&quot;.6,     In September, 1920, the question had been raised bythe jftrelgn Office who wroto as follows&quot;1 am directed by Barl Ourzon of K.&apos;edleston to aoknow-ledge the receipt of your memorandum Itf.I.D/O.L.1360, transmitting a copy of a telegram from the Commander in Chief, Mediterranean, on tho subjeot. of freedom of navigation in the Black Sea.I am to inform you that in His Lordships opinion, it is no longer possible to suspend freedom of naviga-tion in the Black Sea, in viaw cf tho Cabinet decision to complete the IC-rado Agreement with Soviet Russia, and of the necessity of close co-operation with the Italian Government, in all matters of European policy. Subject, therefore, to the concurrence of the Lor&amp;a&apos;Commission-ers of the Admiralty, and tho Army Cornell, who are also being&apos; consulted, His Lordship proposes to instruct His Majestyrs High Commissioner at Constantinople toallow full freedom of navigation in the Black Sea to merchant Ships....egraia from in-G*iterranean cat, ta admiralty.ter Mo. 428/B/3G m foreign ioe to&apos; admiralty, ed 18th tr.!920*
admiralty letter !j, of 27th sept. to Foreign office.see CP.3088Telegram from Admiralty to 0 .-in-c * Mediterranean, dated 11.11&amp;0.4,     From the above considerations, Their Lordships consider that it would be preferable to postpone Lord curzorJs proposals for the present&quot;.6,    Qn receipt of instructions conveyed in a personal letter from I r. Bonar law to sir James Craig &quot;dated november loth, the following orders were sent to theOommander in chief, Mediterranean;-J5:&quot;With regard to commercial trade in the 31ack Sea, the policy of His Majesty s Government is that no restrictions should be placed upon it.   An exception would be made in any case where there was ground for suspicion that arms likely to be used for assisting the forces of the Turkish Rationalists were carried by -particular ships.   You are requested to act in accordance with this line of policy and to acknowledge receipt of this telegram&quot;.fi   Hot circulated.LMerchant ships other than those carrying munitions . of war, and to consult his French and Italian colleagues as to the be^t methods&apos;of examining ships, and preventing any traffic in arms and ammunition between any of the Black Sea ports. Discretionary power will, however, still remain with the High commission in consultation with his colleagues to suspend freedom of navigation should unforeseen military conditions arise.Copies of the draft replies proposed are enclosed&quot;, jiThe Admiralty replied as follows&quot;Tith reference to your letter of the 18th September, no, 214428/N/38, on the subject ef freedom of navigation in the Black sea, 1 am commanded by My Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to acquaint you, for information of the Secretary of state for foreign Affairs, that they were not aware that a cabinet decision had been reached on the question of concluding a Trade A^re; ment with Soviet-Russia.2.    Their Lordships have never concurred in the resumption of trade relations with Soviet Russia, an$ only as recently as the 27th instant the First Lord stated his views to the cabinet on this subject.3.    Their Lordships are&quot;not in agreement, also, with the proposals respecting the Black Sea. If, as is stated, to be likely by the Commander in Chief, Mediterranean, in his tele-tram 432s, General Wran^el declared a blockade of Odessa or other ports, and was supported by the French, a very awkward situation would arise for British Herchant ships. In this connection, moreover, it may be remembered that the Bolsheviks have recently laid mines off Odessa and traffic to that place proceeds with some risk.-
As a corollary to these instructions(a) The Admiralty now propose to cancel the order (para. 2b of c.0. 396) giving&apos; the Allied Naval authorities at Constantinople discretionary powers as to the ships and ca?r^oes they may permit to &quot;proceed to Russian 31ack Sea ports.(b) They further request instructions whether any vesseis suspected of &amp;*irying arms and munitions consigned to the Russian soviet Government or its agents, may still be searched, and if necessary, sent in for further orders to a port belon^inc; to, or in the occupation of, the Allied or Associated powers,   (para 4 of same order),   Both the Black Sea and the Baltic are affected by this order.8.   They point out that the policy followed has throughoutbeen and inter-Allied - not a British - policy and theyhave represented to the Foreign office that necessary action should be taken to inform our Allies of the present position.(intld.)   W.H.L.Admiralty, &apos;/    13th Favember, 1980.
