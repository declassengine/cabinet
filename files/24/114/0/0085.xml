This Document is the Property ofHis Britannic Majestyf3 Government Circulated by the Secretary of State for Mia.CP.  2084 V IRELAND.&quot; &apos; ask for an early day for a discussion of Irish affairs.   It is not so much that I have anything to suggest to my colleagues as that I am deeply anxious about the present situation, and my anxiety is all the greater because it is not founded on any other information than that which appears in the newspapers and in Parliament.I have never since the early stages of the preparation of the Home Rule Bill intervened in the discussion of Irish affairs, because I was hoping for a happy solution of our troubles and desired to support unquestioningly the conclusions and the actions of those of my colleagues who had been entrusted with direct responsibility.But I confess I am inclined to gloomy pessimism on the subject. No reports on the condition of Ireland are circulated to the Cabinet. I do not know whether there is anything to hope for except (1) the success of the present administrative policy, and (2) the passage of the Home Rule Act.Now, as to the present administrative policy, am I right in saying that, having regard to the impossibility of obtaining lawful punishment of detestable outrage, the Government are acquiescing in unlawful and often vicarious punishment of these outrages ? I read with a glow of hope the Chief Secretary&apos;s assurances that things are improving. Am I wrong in thinking that his splendid optimism must sometimes be daunted by what appears to be the increasing frequency of murder on the one hand or the other? I am assured by the Chief Secretary or by the Prime Minister that steps are being taken to try or to punish reprisals. But I notice that uniformed men, undeterred, continue to commit reprisals, and I hear accounts of the &quot; black and tan &quot; officers as being wholly undisciplined, shooting and burning indiscriminately. I am confronted with convincing appeals that you must have regard to the provocation, and that it would be monstrous to deal punitively with those who are guilty of reprisals, and I am told that they have every reason to believe that the Government has encouraged them in the action they feel justified in taking. I hear and read stories, not of vengeance in hot blood, but of deliberate outrage, carefully planned and thought out without authoritative and definite permission by uniformed men as an answer to outrage. Terror is answered by terror, crime by crime, blood by blood. I feel a growing conviction that even if the murder gang in Ireland can be destroyed by this process which I doubt the younger generation in Ireland is being educated in murderous thought and is entering upon manhood and public life with murder and revenge in their hearts.But let us assume that peace is restored by these methods, and that, all others having failed, this is the only method which those with whom responsibility rests can find. What happens then? Surely negotiation and peaceful solution become more difficult every day with every murder and with every reprisal.If after reparation had been exacted and murderers punished the policy envisaged was to leave Ireland to stew in her own juice, I could understand ; hut we are all determined that Ireland should remain part of the British Imperial system. We have got to live with these men, or, rather, the survivors. We have got to hope for partnership with the owners of destroyed factories. The Prime Minister yesterday described the situation as one of war. Does it not follow that we should consider the termination of the war?As I understand it, the real facts of the case are that the Government dislikes reprisals as much as anybody, hut feels that, failing some better remedy for the present situation, they would he doing a disservice to the objects they have at heart in punishing them with severity. If that be the true state of the case there is, it seems to me, an admission of guilt on both sides. Thus stated it would appear that, on the one hand, the Irish have been guilty of wicked and indefensible murders and outrages upon blameless, brave officers of the Crown to whom our thanks are due. The Irish would regard their actions as acts of war resulting from years or decades of provocation. On the other hand, individual members of the forces of the Crown have been guilty, so far as I can judge, of outrages which we can only defend by quoting the undeniable provocation they have received. If this is the situation on both sides, has not the time come for immediate negotiation? 2690  100  11.20
Failing this, I presume our hopes can only he based on the restoration of order by the methods I have discussed above and the passage of the Home Rule Bill.&apos; I wish I could persuade myself that murder does not beget murder. But what of the Home Rule Bill ? I have followed debates on amendments in the House of Commons which were designed to enlarge the powers of&apos; the new Irish Parliaments, and I am. bound to confess that I have felt some difficulty on occasion in supporting the Government view. I have always thought, for instance, that we were pledged to give to Ireland the completest principles of self-government compatible with the safety of the British Empire. I cannot understand how, consistently with that, amendments such as the grant of fiscal autonomy to Ireland have been refused. I cannot under-stand that this would have been dangerous to the safely of the British Empire.lam so perplexed, I cannot help believing that there must be something definite, something which my colleagues who are concerned with Irish affairs foresee; some negotiations which are under consideration;. something which would make the position tolerable, if I was in possession of all the facts. The Prime Minister must have before him some settled plan. What is it ? For myself, I see nothing but a legacy of unconquerable hatred between the two countries and no result from a legislative effort upon which Parliament and the country has been expending a great amount of time.Meanwhile we are losing moral force and a great reputation throughout the world. Are there none of my colleagues in a similar position, and would not a Cabinet discussion serve&quot; some of my colleagues in a similar position ?May I plead further that if I have only a common interest and no direct responsi-bility in Ireland, everything that occurs there is reacting in India ? The methods of the Sinn Feiners are being observed and considered for application to India, and the Government of India&apos;s sincerity with regard to reprisals in India is being tested by their attitude towards reprisals in Ireland. It is of the highest importance from this point of view that I should be in a position to understand and accept the Irish position.E. S. M.10th November 1920.
