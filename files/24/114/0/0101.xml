BOLiSBEVIK    PROPAGANDA.ov       ffabinet fry the First Lord of, the..Aamiralty. .. ^. ,I am impressed by the diverse and conflicting reports which are being received concerning the Bolshevik movement in Russia and Bolshevik propaganda in foreign countries..       On the one hand, we learn from mere than one source of the approaching dissolution of the Soviet Government cf Russia:, on the other hand, we are tcld that their ideas S.re slowly but surely becoming dominant throughout the greater part of the world.There are undoubted indications that the extremist elements in Moscow are about to give way to a very much more moderate party*, not, indeed, that the present Government will fall, but that the more extreme menbers may gc, and a new policy cf moderation be adopted.Yet it would be idle to ignore, as it is unwise to exaggerate, the effect of the propaganda which is being s edulous ly advocate d thr oughout the wor Id.      We have abundant proof that communistic propaganda, which relies on seditious and revolutionary methods, is most activeoSo far as the Admiralty are concerned, we continue to receive evidence of such propaganda among sailors and dockyard workmen.Our present policy towards Russia may be concisely expressed .&quot;by an extract from a reply which the Prime Minister gave in the House cf Commons on the 8th November11 As scon as British prisoners are released, and &quot;all hostile propaganda by the Soviet Government !!has ceased, the trade agreement will be &quot;completed&quot;.The resumption of normal relations with Russia at a later date would be a natural consequence.It appears to me, therefore, to be of fundamental importance that we should be in a position to know that the second condition mentioned (no hostile propaganda) is in fact fulfilled.      I need only mention here the attempts made by the existing Russian Government to disclaim responsibility for propaganda by such subterfuge as the attribution cf the movement to the Third International, which they seek to represent as a body representing all nations, for whose activities they are consequently not responsible.I venture to ask whether the time has net come to set up a small Committee, tfc  examine and assess the various reports which are received; to report whether the conditions laid down for the resumption of trade are in fact being carried out - and if not, to consider what action, by way cf counter-propaganda or otherwise, is desirable to check the sinister activities of the extremists-It is net for me to suggest who should be Chairman cf the Committee but I may perhaps be allowed to say that I personally should be very glad if the Lord Chancellor were to sit in this capacity.
It will be remambered that a similar1 Oormittee appointed in January 1919 was responsible for the exist ing organization for counter-propaganda.(intldO    Wo H. Lo12*11*20.
