By Sir MontagueBarlow, M.P. and Mr. Hipweod^ the two British Government Delegates at the recent Genoa. Conference.(Previous Papers CP. 1186, CP.1379, CP. 1824, C.p. 1932and CP.1959)1, A full report of the Genoa Confer once and its resultsby the two Government Delegates is already before the 1824.     Cabinet, $    But we think it desirable to supplement that Report by a short Memorandum dealing with the position of the International Bureau du Travail,  ,its policy and its relation to Departmental and Government work in this country.2. We are clear that the Labour Organisation set up by thepeace Treaty Urts.367 etc.) has important work to discharge in t he f utu re.   Int er na ti ona 1 r el a ti ons, includi ng In t er -national Latcur relations,&quot;are becoming daily more closely linker].   The permanent Labour Organisation constituted by the Peace Treaty cons lets of (a) Conferences of Delegates such as that recently held at Genoa- and fb) an International Labour Office controlled by ic) a Governing Body of 24 members Art/388).   These Conferences and the International Labour Office should be of great help in assisting to solve labour problems all over the world-   But this satisfactory result can only be secured provided care is given to see that the work of the Bureau and of the Conferences is conducted on states-manlike lines, an6 with due regard to the difficulties of international relations.3.     The
Tho constitution of tho Governing Body is as follows,, the y?.p:&apos;--eir-(r3ir^,&apos;frlves- being chosen for three years;-M* Fontaine a very able French Government official, is the Chairman and there are 23 ether members of whom 11 are Government representatives (making 12 with M,Fontaine) while 12 represent Industry, 6 from the employers side and 6 from the workpeople (^rtc 395 of the Peace Treaty), Prance has 3 representatives on the Governing Body and so has Great Britain, no other country having more than 2*   The British representatives a re:-Got eminent Employers,, Worker SoSir Malcolm Belevingne   Sir Allan Bmith      Mr,Stuart Sunning,The 5 French representatives besides M.Fontaine (the Chairman) include the powerful personality of M*Jouhaux, tho Secretary of the Confederation Generale du Travail,   The future efficiency and good work of the Bureau must largely depend on the satisfactory work of the Governing Body.It is important to note that the Chairman as well as the Director is a Frenchman,,   It is not necessary to go into this point at length, but it is obvious that if the two chief positions, viz0 of Chairman of the Governing Body ana Director of the Bureau, are held by members of the same nation, diffi-culties may arise.With regard to tho relation of the work of the Bureau and the Conference to governmental and departmental activities in London, it is easential that there should be one centre where the whole of this International Labour work can be dealt with, and which can form a repository of knowledge as to previous Conferences and keep continually in touch   1th the Labour Bureau at Geneva and prepare the work for future Conferences,   At present the communications from the Bureau/ come
come to this country in somewhat haphazard fashion,   under the Treaty itself Urt,397) the representatives of our Government on tho G-overninpr Body is indicated an the channel for commu-nications; oonsenuently jnany ooinmunioati ons oome from the Bureau to the British Government through Sir Malcolm Del evince.In addition, however, the Bureau communoates at times direct with the Board of Trade, the Ministry of agriculture, of course with the Ministry of Labour, and also with other Government Departments.   Also addresses enquiries directly to Trade Unions and Industrial Bodies in this country *   ?his arrangement, or want of arrangement, is clearly unsatisfactory.5. In our view the Ministry of Labour is the proper centre at which aj.1 the work connected with the International Labour Bureau and the International Labour Conference should be co-ordinated.^ The documents should all be filed there and the Ministry of Labour should be the channel of correspondence, the centre with which other Government Departments should communicate.It would probably &quot;he desirable to form in the Ministryof labour something in the way of a Council or Committee witha Minister at the head, and of which the members should be thechief permanent officials of the Home Office (including SirMalcolm Delevingne), the Board of Trade, Ministry of Shipy-ingfor the time being, Ministry of Agriculture, probably theScottish and Irish Offices,- and any other Department interestedin labour questions.   There should be a Branch at the labour ministry responsible for this International wort which shouldwarn each Government Department of International, labour matters affecting that Department as they arise.   It should see that the decisions of past Conferences are dealt with and should prepare in advance for future Conferences.(Sd,) 0.A, Montague Barlow.(Sd.) C Hipwood.1st November, 1920.
