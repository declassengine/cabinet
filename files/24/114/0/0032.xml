I&quot;   II-Tbfri   ..&apos;oWinC A B I IE T.CP.SALE   gF   AUSTRALASIAN   MEAT, REPORT BY FOOD CONTROLLER. Reference Cabinet (25(2) Conclusion 6(e)cjMy last report on tho sale of Australasian Meat &quot;by my Department was tted 1st October, 1920, with a supplementary report dated 4th October, 300.STOCKS. The stock position as at 23rd October is shown on the iaoEeui&quot; chedule.CONSUMPTION4        foidos of Imported Meat for Consumption.iek ended	Total sales	Australasian	S iAmerican	Australasian		meat	meat	mutton &amp; lamb.

It is of interest to compare the output with the jrresponding period in October, 1918, when under the rationing system the otal output of imported meat was only 3,875 tons during the four weeks.A film was prepared for advertising purposes to advocate the use of )lonial Mutton. It has been shown for one week in each of about 1,000 sleeted cinemas.FORWARD SALES.   The sales specified in my last report determined the lability of the Ministry for all supplies of Beef from Australasia, and teir effect is to reduce the total quantity of meat now to be disposed of F the Ministry to about 120,000 tons.   This figure compares with the atlmated quantity of over 500,000 tons at the commencement of the current Inane ial year.The sales of Beef have evoked some hostility from the Importing Agents ho would otherwise have derived commissions from the sale of this Beef, have, however, given the Agents an assurance that the existing channels t distribution for Mutton and Lamb will be continued, since these are iequate, for dealing with Mutton and Lamb, which was not the case, in res-&amp;ot of Australasian Beef,   it is anticipated therefore that there will be o further occasion for sales in block, except possibly as regards the nal balance of stocks.NEW SEASON!S FREE MEAT.   Some difficulty will be experienced in satisfy-ig the demands oT Australia and New Zealand for space for the carriage of ae New Season^ Free Meat. Careful consideration is now being given to this itter in order to adjust the requirements of the Ministry and of the ivate shippers.   It ia possible that a limited amount of space may be made tollable for private shippers in December and an increasing amount of space hereafter.   It is hoped that the whole of the Ministry1 s meat will be &apos;fted by the end of February.TERMINATION OF CONTRACTS.   Subject to satisfactory arrangements being ide i&apos;or the carriage of the New Season1 s meat, agreement has been reached at the purchase contracts with the States of Victoria, New South Wales, f Western Australia shall terminate on 31st October and with South stralia on 30th September.STRIKE.   The strike has not so far had any appreciable effect on the le ot imported meat.   Measures have been taken to provide for effective stribution if the occasion should arise.NISTRY OF FOOD, it November, 1920.CHARLES A, McCURDY.
