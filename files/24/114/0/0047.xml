THE GUARANTEE OF TUP LEAGUE OF NATIONS IN RESPECT OF MINORITIESCLAUSES OF CERTAIN TREATIESReport presented to and adopted by the Council of the League of Nations footing in Brussels, October, 1920.I(Circulated for Information).- i-eo/4/92,tPalais d^s Academies, Brussels.27th October, 1920,The Council of the League of Nations has thought it advisable to determine the nature and limits of the guarantees with regard to the protection of jvllnoritios provided for by the different Treaties.The stipulations of the Treatlos with regard to Minorities are generally defined in the following terms: -&quot;The country concerned agrees that the stipulations -in the foregoing articles, so far as thoy affect persons belong-Ing to racial, linguistic or religious minorities constitute obligations of international concern, and shall be placed under the guarantee of the League of Nations&quot;.The stipulations with regard to Minorities declare further that the country concerned &quot;agrees that any Member of the Council of the League of Nations shall have the right to bring to the attention of the Council any infraction, or any danger of infraction, of any of these obligations, and that the Council may thereupon take such action and give but, direction as it may deem proper and effective in the circumstances&quot;,The oountries ooncerned have further agreed that any
difference of opinion ay to questions of law or fact arising; outof those articles between the Oovornnont concerned and any one of the Powers, a : ember of the Council of tho League of Nations, shall be hold to bo a dispute of am. international character under Article 14 of tho Covenant of the r.,earns of Nations, wh:J oh dispute shall, if tho other party thereto demandbo referred to the Permanent Court of International Justice.Up to the present tine international law has entrusted to the or eat Powers tho guarantee for.the execution of similar provisions.     The Treaties of &quot;oaco have introduced a now system: Thctf have appealed to the Leame of Nations.The Council and tho Permanent Court of Justice are the two organs of the League charged with the practical execution of tho guarantee.It may bo advisable at the outset to define clearly the exact meaning of the term &quot;Guarantee of the League of Nations&quot; It eeems clear that this stipulation moans, above all, that the provision for tho protection of minorities are inviolable:   that is to say, they cannot be modified in the sense of violating in any way rights actually ^recognise:&apos;, and without the approval of the majority of the Council of the League of nations.     Secondly,, this stipulation moan&quot; that the League must ascertain that the provlsionsjfor the protection of minorities are always observed,ifThe Council must take action in the event of any infraction, or danger of infraction, of any of the obligations with regard to the minor!tes in question.     The Treaties in this respoct are suite clear.     They indicate the procedure that should be follower1.The right of codling attention to any infraction, or danger of infraction is reserved to the members of trie Council, This is, in a way, a right and a duty of the Powers represented on the Council,     By this ri-irb, they uro, in fact, asked to take a special interest in the protection of minorities.
Evidently, this right does not in any way e7.oli.ido the right of the minorities themselves, or even of States not repro-sented on the Council, to call the attention of the Loague of Nations to any infraction, or danger of infraction.     But this act must retain tho nature of a petition, or a report pure and simple;   it cannot have the legal effect of putting the matter before the Council and calling upon it to Intervene.Consequently, when a petition with regard to the question of minoritiee is addressed to tho Loaguo of Nations, the Secretary-General should communicate it, without comment, to the members of the Council for information.    This communication does not yet constitute a judicial act of the League, or of its organs,    Tho competence of the Council to deal with the question arisos only when one of Its members draws its attention to the infraction, or the danger of Infraction, which is the subject of the petition or report *The state interested, if it is a member of the League, is informed at the same time as the Council of the subject of the petition.      As a matter of fact, the Secretariat General has for some time adopted the procedure of forwarding immediately to all the members of the League any document forwarded for the informa-tion of members of the Council.    This information which may give the State concerned an opportunity of submitting to the members of the Council such remarks as it may consider desirable, does not, however, partake of the nature of a request of the League for information with regard to the subjeot of the petition, nor yet does it imply, with regard to the state concerned, the obligation of furnishing evidence in its defence,Any cases where, aa the result of the petition, the intervention of the Leaguo seems to be urgently necessary, theSecretary General may also adopt the above proceduro, but in vjlewof the urgency of the case, he will forward the petition in ouestionto the
to the members of the Council as soon as possible (by telegraph if he think it advisable).

Each ? represented on the Council may demand that an urgent Council meeting be summoned in accordance with the provisions of the regulations in force.

This precaution will have the object of preventing any sudden act of oppression of minorities.

If the Council approves of the interpretation which I have had the honour to develop, it might adopt the following resolution:-

RESOLUTION

The Council invites its members to draw the very special attention of their Governments to the conclusions arrived at in the present report.
