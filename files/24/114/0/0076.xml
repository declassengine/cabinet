C.P.-2075.OABIBBT.THE ASSEMBLY flF THE LEAGUE 8F NAT^NS,report ou theATTENDING THE FIRST SESSION.1. In accordance with the Conclusion cf the Cabinet on Thursday, October 14, 1920 (Cabinet 55 (20), Conclusion 1), Mr Balfour, Lord Curzon and Mr H.A.L. Fisher, vrith Sir Maurice Hankey as Secretary, wt on Wednesday, November 3, at 5-30 p.m,, to consider whether it was advisable that the Prime Minister should attend a few meetings of the forthcoming-Session of the Assembly of the League of Nations.2. No doubt was felt that, on general grounds, it would be an advantage for the Prime Minister to attend.   M. Delaoroix, the Prime Minister of Belgium, had announced his intention of attending if Tir Lloyd George was present, and this might result in attracting the Prime Ministers of other countries to Geneva,   Thus the prestiga of the League would be en-hanced.   It is understood that the Secretary General of the Leapue is endeavouring to arrange the programme in such a manner as to focus th&apos;: discussion of the more important subjects in the last week of the Assembly, and if the Prime minister should attend at all, that would be the most con-venient time.$. The particular sublets b^ore the Assembly, for the discussion of which the Prim  Minister&apos;s presence might prove desirable, ere:-(a) The question of the admission of Germanyto t.i\v League;:and(b) DisarmamentThis Doouimmt is the Property of His BritMmlcMa lestvIs fitvernment
4. In regard to the question of the admission of Germany, it appears that Dr Simons, the Gentian Foreign Minister, recently rrade a speech in which he declared that the League of Nations was not yet popular in Germany, and that it would be premature for Germany to,demand admission.   Hence the question in not likely to be raised in,its most acute form by a request by Ger. any for admission.   On the other hand, Bulgaria and perhaps other ex-enemy States will probably demand admission, and the discussion of their request will almost Inevitably raise the question cf the admission of Germany,   This question is one of the greatest delicacy in the present state of international relations.5. British opinion appears, on the whole, to be veering in favour cf the admission of Germany to the League, and this view is supported, particularly strongly in the Labour Party,. French opinion^ however^ is unquestionably strongly against the admission cf Germany at the present time.   The official French view, as announced by H. Bourgeois in a public speech.^ is that Prance will net oppose the afeission of Germany when that country has clearly shewn her intention to carry out the Treaty cf Versailles in good faith.   Prance, however, holds vehemently that Germany has not yet shown such inten-tions, and ii. Leon Bourgeois, in a private conversation with Mr Dalfour at Brussels, did not conceal that if Germany were admitted to the League, Prance would retire from it. Enquiries are being made in various Departments as to how far Germany is showing good faith.   Those made in the Foreign Office indicate that although Germany has executed a part cf the Treaty of Versailles, she h:s not as yet gone far enough to determine the question of her admission to the S League.  &quot;For the Eritish representatives at the Assembly to advocate the admission of Germany when the representatives of Prance were opposing it, would result in a public discus-sion at the League of a highly inconvenient character, and
would a^ravate the relations between the two countries. Even if the British support to the admission of Gen; any were expressed as a counsel of perfection to be waived in deference to Franco, to whor; v;e are bound by such strong ties, it could hardly fail to create a pain Ail impression -in France.   If announced by the proposal-:e&quot; Minister, it would carry the greatest possible authority, and this impression would be accentuated,6, The second qu stibn, viz., that of Disarmament, is. a particularly thorny one at the present time.   Its inherent difficulties are increased by the fact that three of the greatest nations in the world, namely, the United States of America, Germany and Russia, are not yet members of the League.   Moreover, the Permanent OoemeLssion for the study of this question has not been Ion, in existence and cannot possibly complete the exhaustive enquiries necessary for a solution or the question before the meeting of the first Assembly.   It is doubtful, therefor, whether much progress can be ^aoV at the forthcoming aeetinr.   On the other hand, it seems urgent, in view of the Importance attached by the recent Financial Conference in Brussels to disarmament in relation to finance, that the question should be discussed. At the present ti*. s, however, it is difficult to foresee whether the discussions will reach a sufficiently important, ata^ to require tie- presence of the Prime Kindster.7. On a review of the foregoing considerations, the Oonf&apos;-:rencft, while attaching importance to the presence of the Prime Minister from  the point of view of enhancing the prestige of the League, were of opinion that it would, be wiser not to take a decision at the present moment, but to await developments both in regard to the business of the i^processes-bly, which is lively to last a month, as well as of the Parliamentary situation at home.
B. They recommend that an announcement should be madein the sense that  Thy Prime Minister hopes to take soae part in the work of. the Assembly of the League at Geneva, but that his final decision vrii&apos;i depend upon the course of business in Parliament.* * * *hitehal 1&apos; Gardens, S. v. 1, November 5, 1920.-4-
