Circulated by the Secretary of State for India.SECRET.Telegram, from Viceroij, Home Department, to Secretary of Slate,dated 3CM/t October 1920The following are weekly telegrams : Gandhi continued his tour in Punjab, where he has tried to kindle excitement among Sikhs and has attempted Mohamed Ali&apos;s tactics in Islamia College, Lahore, and Khalsa College, Amritsar. In speech at Lahore said it wasduty of his supporters to annihilate tyrannical Government and that such fearful Government had better be wiped out of existence. He referred to bravery of Sikhs who had shed blood in different battle-fields for British Government and were requitted by horrors of martial law. He urged them to adopt non-co-operation with Government, especially in mattei- of supplying recruits for Army. As already reported, non-co-operation accepted by Sikh League, and the attitude of Sikhs is distinctly disquieting, but so far as propaganda of non-co-operation goes has had no effect on recruitment for the Army or police nor on loyalty of civil officers of Government. To students of Lahore and Amritsar, Gandhi made seditious speeches urging non-violent non-co-operation as only means of securmg real independence for those who were not able to use words. Great temporary excitement caused among students. His action in tampering with them is viewed by parents and elders with disavowal and disfavour. Students encouraged to form Non-co-operation League and defy authority of parents, on analogy that they would not obey parents if ordered by them to eat beef and pork. But latest reports from papers indicate excitement among students dying. Situation in Islamia College hopeful, and in D.A.V. College out of 1,024 students only 24 have so far withdrawn names. ShafVs presence at Lahore had calming influence. About 350 students of Islamia College have signed protest against non-co-operation. College closed for 10 days. From confidential report we learn that great pressure was brought to bear on Lala Harkishen Lai to withdraw from candidature for elections at private meeting held in Lahore. To Sikhs present Gandhi said he would insist on non-violent methods, but if in spite of his advice Sikhs intended to take risks they might do so. Lala Harkishen Lai said that Gandhi was taking a great risk upon himself in preaching non-co-operation among inflammable masses of Punjab, and he himself would not support programme, but would not oppose it unless he foresaw mischief resulting. He feared Sikhs might have recourse to violence, and if he saw likelihood of this he should oppose Gandhi.Lieutenant-Governor of the Punjab has declared districts of Lahore, Amritsar and Sheikhpura as proclaimed districts under Seditious Meetings Act as continuance of public speaking on present lines in central areas of the Province must lead at no distant date to outbreaks of violence and disorder.   Communique issued by Local Government gives full and adequate explanation of necessity for this step, which has only been taken after repeated warnings, and will be withdrawn as soon as present violence of speech abandoned.   Public meetings held within municipalities Lahore and Amritsar will for the present be exempted from provisions of Act.   Religious and election meetings may be held without permission.   Zafar Ali Khan convicted by District Magistrate, Lahore, to five years&apos; transportation.   News created some local sensation, city observing partial hartal.   Gandhi left Punjab for Bombay to meet Wedgwood, but still fomenting trouble at Aligarh by writing to trustees. Hopes for peaceful evolution of struggle and that the Government will not restrict liberty, but if Government wish to suppress peaceful action, hopes they will issue&apos;lib internment orders as it will not be possible for him to respect any such orders unless personal movements physically restrained.   Letter written ostensibly on account of report that police called in to aid trustees.   Gandhi offered to attend meeting to advise trustees.   Honorary Secretary at once replied denying that special or Government aid was being invoked declining to invite Gandhi to meet trustees and stating adherence to old established policy.  During week great excitement in both camps, parents, trustees and old boys arriving at Aligarh.   Establishment of national educational institution with Mahomed Ali as Principal and Abul Kalam Azad head of religious instruction put forward by Mahomed Ali&apos;s party.   Trustees held meeting on 27th; 62 trustees, including Hyderabad and Punjab, present.   Traditional policy 2635     100 11.20
of College strongly supported by overwhelming majority. Proposal of Shaukat ,AH and eight other trustees to renounce Government grant and University Charter, and to disaffiliate College from Allahabad University rejected. Action of Shaukat Ali interfering College discipline by inducing students to adopt non-co-operation disapproved. Measures taken by Principal and Syndicate approved. Message of support and encouragement was received from many trustees unable to attend and from old boys, parents and other well-wishers of College. It remains to be seen what action students will take on decision of trustees, but Local Government has considerable hopes that majority will settle down, their first enthusiasm being dispelled. We think it is possible that Gandhi&apos;s efforts to influence students will bring great discredit on the whole of his mischievous campaign.In Bombay Gandhi now urging students to form Students&apos; Non-Co-operation Association ;and withdraw from Government-owned or aided institutions.From Viceroy, Home Department, to Secretary of State for India,Ust October 1920.Part II. At meeting of Western India Liberal Association Sir NarayanChanda-varkar, Mr. K. Natarajan, and Sir Dinshaw Wacha condemned nonTCOoperation movement, last speaker calling it political suicide. In Madras, the District Conference at Vizagapatam rejected non-co-operation resolution by large majority.Last week&apos;s telegram contained no detailed report from Bihar and Orissa. It is as follows: -Non-co-operation movement agitation being vigorously prosecuted in some districts, but so far with little success. Sporadic attempts made to found arbitration tribunals and induce people to bring grievances before them, but without success. Efforts made to induce villagers to refrain from voting may have some success owing to ignorance of villagers. Attempts beingmade to enlist support of students in colleges and schools and to organise bands of volunteer workers, but with little success. Political activity has increased somewhat. Counter manifestoes published by moderates, aud both in Gya and Patna respectable men strongly opposing non-co-operation in all iorms. Congress Sub-Committee, consisting of Gandhi, Patel, Kelkar, Rangasirarni, Iyengar, published report on draft constitution of Congress for public criticism. Main change in Article Instating object of Congress is attainment of self-government by people of India by all peaceful and legitimate means, omitting constitutional.

Chairman of Reception Committee not to speak more than 15 minutes, and President not more than .4.5.There are no developments of importance to report as regards (industrial unrest, chief interest in this connection being centred in All-India Trade Union Congress,; at which Lajpat Rai will preside.We have no fresh news from Bombay, but that Presidency and Punjab are the two areas which cause chief anxiety. In Delhi, volunteer movement developing. We will address you separately on this. In Bengal,,the financial proposals of the (? Jail-Joint) Committee are exercising moderates, and extremists also, shut the -export, of -wheat continues to be subject of some comment.
