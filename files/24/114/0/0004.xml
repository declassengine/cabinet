.........TRANS IT&apos; AND 0 012OTICAT IONS.Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.(1)       I circulate herewith copies of four draft International Conventions which have been received from the Seoretary General of the League of Nations, and which it is understood have beon prepared by an informal international Committee under the instructions of the Secretariat of the League for discussion at a General Conference whioh the Assembly of the League will&apos; be invited at its November Meeting to summon at an oarly date.(2)      The draft Conventions are intended to comply with that part of Article 25 (B) of the Covenant of the League which &apos; lays down that &quot;Subject to and in accordance with the provisions of &apos;* International Conventions existing or hereafter to be agreed Upon the members of the League will make provision to&apos; secure and maintain freedom of communication and of transit&quot;.(3)       It may also be observed that the negotiation of general conventions for those purposes is expressly contemplated by Articlo 379 of the Treaty of Peace with Germany and the corresponding articles of the other Treaties of Peace, (which require the ex*enemy powers to adhere to such Conventions when established) and also by Articles in the Treaties with the New States and in the draft Mandates whioh impose corresponding obligations on the new States and the Mandatory Powers.(4)       Though His Majesty*s Government is in no way committed to the details of any of the draft Conventions, I would point out that the general principles on which th^y are framed follow closely the principles which were strongly advocated by the British Empire Delegation at the Peace Conference.   In fact it was only the difficulties raised by certain other Powers (especially the United States) that prevented the incorporation in the Peace Treaties themselves of general Conventions on Freo Transit, International Rivers etc ;,&apos; substantially on the lines Of the drafts now submitted;   While, moreover, the obligations imposed on the Enemy powers with regard to these matters in the Treaties are unilateral at the outset it is to be remembered that all these provisions may fall to the ground at the end of five years* unless the Allies grant reciprocity, or unless in the meantime General Conventions are established binding both on the Allies and on the ex**enemy states.(5)       From the point of view of the general wellbeing of the countries whioh the League of Nations represents it is evident that the necessity of some suehXinternational agreements as those embodied in the draft Conventions has become far more urgent than formerly through the rearrangement of the map of the world under the Treaties of Peace. Trade routes and&apos; /railway*  See Article 378 of the treaty with Germany.\/
railway and river systems which were previously included within a single State have now become international, and the whole economic life of some of the states both old and new whose frontiers have been adjusted in those treaties may be imperilled by the denial of facilities for transit and traffic through the countries by which they are surrounded.    Such provision to guard against these dangers as was possible to frame at the Peace Conference has been inserted in the Treaties, but this is merely partial, temporary and provisional and needs to be completed by Agreements binding on all the States members of the League of Nations.(6)     But I would also point out the special interest of the British Kmpire in the proposed Conventions.    It is not too much to say that the British Empire is moro deeply interested than any other country (except perhaps some of the new land-locked States) in securing the establishment by International agreement of the liberal principles of transit and communications which she has generally advocated and practised and which her vast commercial and maritime interests so essentially require.    Even therefore if it be found on examination that the draft Conventions involve some slight modification of existing practice in some parts of the Empire this saorifioe has to be weighed against the far greater advantage of bringing the principal commercial nations of the world into line with British practice In many important respects.(7)      For the above reasons I suggest that it is both the duty and interest of His Majesty&apos;s Government to examine in the most sympathetic and favourable manner the details of the draft Conventions now circulated, and also to commend them to the favourable consideration of tho Governments of other parts of the British Smplre.(8)     As regards tho details of the draft Conventions, I would point out that though they have not been officially approved by any Department of His Majesty^ Government, Brigadier General Mance who was one of the British Empire representatives on the Ports and Waterways Commission of the Peace Conference was also a member of the provisional Committee by which the Conventions were drafted, and has kept the Board of Trade generally informed of the proceedings of that Committee.While it is to be expected that careful examination will reveal points in which it is desirable or even essential to obtain amendments in detail, in some at least of the drafts, I would urge that in view of the importance to British interests of the general principles underlying the Conventions, any amendments to be pressed by His Majesty^ Government should be as restricted as possible^(9)      The Board of Trade have already examined the drafts and prepared a short list of Amendments which, in their opinion should be pressed for.   Those include the shorteningof/
... -. ......of tb.d period before any contracting State can denounce the Conventions from ten to five years; more effective provision for revision of details by general agreement at any time, and (probably) the deletion of the provision in Artiole III of the Free Transit Convention which limits the charge for Customs sixpervislon of dutiable goods1 iri transit to that oharsed on free needs,   (0,&apos;his provision seems indefensible besides oonfliotihg with existing Indian and nesopctamian practice).IIo doubt the Ministry of 1&apos;transport and other Departments will have other amendments to surest, and it is proposed to convene an Inierdep&amp;rtiaental Conference to consider the drafts in detail.(10)       I surest that in the meantime a communication should be addressed by His Majesty1s Government to the Governments of other parts of the Lmpire which&quot; are members of the League of Nations, commending the general principles of the draft Conventions and suggesting that the expert advisers of these Governments should meet In London shortly before, the assemblage of the League of nations Conference, for a detailed examination of the drafts from the point of view of the empire.(11)       The Ministry of Transport and the Ministry of Shipping concur generally in this Memorandum.R.S.H. 21st Ootober, 1920.
