v* V, OOI?:iTT:^ PIT UI^ghOYiiHNT 7th Minutes.( 8)        The Com it tee had under consideration a ?&quot;omorandum whioh was circulated at the Meeting by Sir Henry rayhury (C.U. 53) i on the progress of the negotiations for road construction from which it appeared that the London County Council ^ere prepnred. to find 50J-c of the cost of arterial ror/d construction ^ithin the London County Council area;   that *rork n^ould bo begun the cane morning in the -&quot;ool&quot;ridi area on n section of the south circular road, and that other schemes would be proceeded with at once.     Similar progress was also reported *,rith regard to sohenes in tho County cf Essex-and. other areas.The Commit too took note of this statement, and expressed their satisfaction *&apos;-ith the rapid progress that had been made.It was stated in Sir HenryMaybury*s paper that great difficulty was anticipated in carrying out the decision of the Cabinet that during a probationary period of four months only 75% of the standard district rate of wages should be paid on unemploy-ed relief works.   The same point was made in the Memorandum by the Minister of Labour, ( C.TJ. 4-9).It was pointed out that the statement in Sir Henry MaVburym memorandum that the 75% limitation was   only applicable to London was incorrect, and that in any event the matter could only be re-opened by taking it to the Cabinet again.It was stated on behalf of the Ministry of Transport that it appeared from conversations which had taken place with individual officers .of the London County Councils and others, that to impose a 75% limit would destroy the wfrcle scheme;   that during- negotiations no formal intimation had been made to the London County Council Committees and other authorities concerned, although individual officers were aware cf the proposal, and were much averse to it.The Committee were informed that schemes were actually starting that day at Woolwich and Norwich, and presumably the men would be paid the standard rates, although it was probable the men themselves would have begun work without knowing what rate of wages they were going to get.
The Committee were of opinion that work should not he started without the matter of wages &quot;being settled, and that the local authorities should have been&apos; informed of the proposedlimit.     Attention was particularly directed to the Impossibility of carry&amp;ng out large schemes for ex-servioe men on houses, if the full standard rates were to be paid to the men employed on roads.The Committee agreed-That the Chairman should forthwith consult the Prime Minister and Lord Privy Seal, and that Sir Henry May &quot;bury should hold himself in readiness to telegraph to Woolwich and Norwich to stop the work till the point had been settled.2 Whitehall Gardens, S.&apos;&apos;M. 27th October, 1920,
