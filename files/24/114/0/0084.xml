This issue raises a question of great constitutional and practical im-portance.   On the one hand, it Is argued that the assumption of such powers by a. British Minister would breach the constitutional rights of the Dominions. On tho other hand, it is maintained that if the British Government be .tot so armed in times of emergeri&amp;y, serious practical consequences might easily ensue. The Issue was brought to the notice o   the Home Affairs Committee in the course of its discussion of the Wire-less Telegraphy and Visual Signalling Bill (C.P.1953) and appeared to the Committee to be of such constitu-tional importance as to deserve reference to the CabinetIn so far as it relates to Ships, the Bill in question merely confirms and makes permanent the Wire-jCopy less Telegraphy Act, 1904. *   Section. 3(3) of that Actannexed.enacts that His Majesty in Council may order that the
Act shall, subject to any conditions, exceptions and qualifications contained In the Order, apply during the continuance of the Order to british ships whilst on the high seas, i.e. among others, ships registered in the Dominions.The Act of 1904 has hitherto been renewed from year to year under the Expiring Laws Continuance Act. It has, in fact., never been enforced so far as Dominion ships are concerned.   The Order in Council of 28th February, 19C8, applying the Act to British ships on the high seas exempts from its operation persons on board any ship registered in the Dominions and equipped with a wireless telegraph installation licensed by the Government of the Dominion in which the ship is registered.The Colonial Office s&amp;ek to insert an amendment In the Bill under consideration for the purpose of giving statutory exemption to ships and aircraft regis-tered in the Dominions while outside the territorial waters of the British Islands,The proposed amendment w?s objected to when the matter was discussed before the Home Affairs Committee on the ground that it amounted in effect to the repeal of a statutory power expressly conferred by Parliament in 1904 and involved statutory recognition of the right of ships registered in the Dominions to be exempted from legislation by the Imperial Parliament.An alternative proposal is contained in a note by the Solicitor-General attached to this Memorandum in which he suggests that ships and aircrajt registered in the Dominions should be exempted from the operation of the Act only when within the territorial waters of
It Is understood that the Admiralty and the Board of Trade support the Colonial Office view,I append a Memorandum from the Colonial Office summarising the arguments in support of their contention.(Intd.)   H.A.L.P.10th November, 1920.

The draft tireless and Visual Signalling Bill (C.P.1953) now under consideration(1)   makes permanent the &quot;ireless Telegraphy Act 1904 which is at present kept in force by the Expiring Laws Ccntinuance Act.    Section 3(5) confers on His Majesty in Council the power to apply tho Act to all British ships when on the high seas, i*eft among others to ships registered in the Dominions * (2)   applies the 1904 Aot to aircraft as it does to ships and thus takes power to apply the Aot to British aircraft registered in the Dominions In applying the 1904 Act to all British ships when on tho high seas by tho Order in Council of the 29th February 1908, persons on beard British ships registered outside the British Islands were especially exempted if the ship was equipped with a tireless Telegraph Installation licensed by the Government of the Dominion jv Colony in vhich it was registered0The Aot has therefore never in fact beor. enforced as far as Dominions ships are conoerned*The scheme of legislation of the Aot of 1904 is no longer In accord with constitutional practice,.    Since the Merchant Shipping Conference of 1907, it has been settled as between His I.;ajesty*s Government and the Dominions not only that the Dominions possess full power to legislate for their own ships but also that thoy should be left to legis-late for their own ships by their own legislation^Thus in his despatch to the Governor-General cf the Commonwealth of Australia cf the 18th September 1908 tho (t       Secretary of Stato for the Colonies (Lord Crewe) stated (p.21 of (3.4355) 8*-OOLOHIAL OFFXOF I1F1&quot;!0RAKDUM*
r,It is entirely a matter for the Parliament of the Commonwealth to decide to what conditions vessels registered in Australia or engaged in the coasting trade should be subject&quot;.This principle has been followed in the Merchant Shipping (Convention) Aot 1914, whioh deals inter alia with tireless Telegraphy, and the Merchant Shipping (Fireless Telegraphy) Act 1919, neither of which applies to ships registered in the Dominions whila outside the United Kingdom.It may further be mentioned that the 4 principal Dominions are entitled to direct representation on tho International Radiotelegraph Sonferenoos on the same footing as the United Kingdom and on that basis signed separately the Radiotelegraph Sonventioxi of 1912,As regards Aircraft, urgent representations were received from the Canadian Government early In 1919 as bo the unconstitutional nature of an early tentative draft Air Navigation Bill and the Dominions are &quot;Contracting States&quot; under the International Air Convention.    Oonsequently the Air Navigation Bill which has passed the House of Lords and is now before the House of Commons is drawn on the basis that It will not apply to Dominion aircraft while outside the United Kingdom and the Dominions are thus left to pass their own legislation for Dominion aircraft while on the high seas. As between His ;.;ajesty*s Government and the Canadian Government in particular, It is well understood that we shall not legislate for Canadian aircraft outside the jurisdiction..In these circumstances it is necessary, in order to regularize the constitutional position, to add to the draft Bill some such clause as the following :^
&quot;The Principal Act an amended by this Act shallnot extend to British ships or British aircraft register-ed in the self-governing Dominions, that is to say, theDominion of Canada, the Commonwealth of Australia(including for.this purpose the territory of Papua andNorfolk Island), the Dominion of New Zealand, the Unionof South Africa and Newfoundland, while outside the*  -.....,.,.........British Islands and the territorial waters abutting on tho coast thereof&quot;aIt is recognised that the Draft Bill is partly required to meet cases of emergency but this does not in any case affect the constitutional position.     It was not only necessary but it was found in practice possible to conduct the Great &apos; &apos;ar without departing from the constitutional position that the Dominions should legislate for their own ships when on the high seas,   and if further Dominion legislation is required for emergencies,   there Is no reason to anticipate that all necessary action will not be taken. By way of illustrating how firmly established Is the constitutional rule as regards ships, it may be added that His Majesty!s&quot;Government definitely renounced during the war all right to requisition British ships registered in the Dominions, although in suoh circumstances a much stronger oase for disregarding the rule might have been made out.It is submitted, therefore, that the Colonial Office amendment introduces nothing that is either new in theory or has proved unworkable in practice and that on the other hand anything of the nature of an attempt to resume what has been freely oonceded can in the existing oircumstances of the Empire only cause trouble.
-HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OB1 HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT).ONPIPBNTIALj. -WIRELESS TELEGjiAPHY AND VISUAL SIGNALLING bill ^ Note by the Solicitor-General.X think the proposed draft clause is too wide. It must be remembered that the Wireless telegraphy Act of 1904 and this Bill, when passed, are to be read together.    (See Clause 9 of the Bill).By Section 3, Sub-Section 3.    &quot;His Majesty mayorder that this SQt shall ....... apply during the con-tinuance of the order to British ships whilst on the High Seas&quot; ,The new clause, as drafted, would except British ships registered in the self-governing Dominions from the above Section 3, Sub-sec ti^At the same time it may be important to retain the powers under the Section, because a vessel outside the territorial waters of the British Islands may still be able to create trouble in wireless telegraphy,   I suggest therefore that the new clause should be altered and that the last two lines should read - &quot;while within the territorial waters abutting on the coasts of the said Dominions&quot;.This would safeguard the authority of the Dominions in their own waters, and still leave the powers under Section 3, Sub-section 3 above, effective.(Sgd)   E.:&apos;..P.29th October, 1920.
