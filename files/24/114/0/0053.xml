s 0 VIST    g U S.......S.....]hA.The 3*3. &quot;Subotnik&quot; is still at Hamburg. S.N.O., Baltic has been instructed that, in view to search at Hamburg not having: discovered arms on board, it is not necessary to search the ship again unless a considerable period elapses before her departure from Germany.   If met with at sea, she is to be boarded and status and des-tination enquired into,Eight Russian Bolshevik prisoners from England in the Finnish S.S. !lAriadne&quot; have been transferred to H.M.S. &quot;Dauntless&quot; at Danzig, and will be detained until the exchange of the Baku British Naval prisoners is aocom-plished.The Schooner &quot;Freheit&quot; (? German) arrived at RevaL early in October and proceeded to the Gulf of Finland. She is reported to he carrying: arms.BALTIC     STATES.The ScSe &quot;Brandenburg&quot;, conveying 1,286 Poles and 108 Letts from Vladivostok to Dansig, called in at Plymouth tc complete with coale   She left Plymouth on the 28th October and is due tt Copenhagen on the 1st November. After disembarkation of passengers, at Danzig, the vessel is to follow her managers orders.CASPIANThe Bolshevik Forces are reported weak and apparently becoming weaker.   The near approach of the closing by ice of the Volga renders remote the possibility of reinforcements being sent.   Further reports as to the transport by river and rail to the Black Sea of Bolshevik Submarines and Motor Launches from the Baltic via Volga and Caspian have been received.     It was reported that about 18th October Bolshevik ships shelled the Cossack positions in the vicinity of Ihoman and North West Persian coast.&apos;B LACK    S E A.It is reported that the formal declaration by General Wrangel of Blockade and mining of the Soviet Russian seaboard is in preparation, and will shortly be issued.TURKEYThe C-in-0 s yacht &quot;Surprise11 will he at Trieste on llth November to embark the new High Commissioner, Sir Hn Eumbcld, for Constantinople.
* 4 mFRANCE.In oonsequenoe of tho sentences passed on the mutineers of tho s.s0 &quot;Menos11, the Syndicate of Maritime Conscripts declared a 24 hours general strike. The order for the strike did not howover arrive in time at all the ports, notably at 1/iarseiilos. and the only port at which the strike appears to have been rreneral was Havre, where the Maritime Tribunal, which tried the mutineers, had sat.It is reported in the press that the sweeping operations in Syrian waters will bo completed at the beginning Of November.C H I H A.On October 16th KWEIOHOW troops, on being driven out of CHUNGKING on the Upper YANGTZE by SZEOHUAN troops, fired on boats crossing the river, some of which had foreigners on board.   A British subject named OOVIL was killed and eventually K.hhS* &quot;WIDGEON&quot; fired twelve rounds over tho retreating troops.The SSECH3AN troops who are now in control of CHUNGKING and the District do not appear hostile.
PART   II.General   Intelligence.INDIA.The Viceroy has received a letter from the Amir of Afghanistan expressing his gratification with the reception accorded to the Afghan Delegation and with the fact that the way had been paved to a treaty of friendship.    The letter ended by asking- that, delegates, not exceeding 20 in number, might be sent to Kabul to conclude negotiations for a treaty.^SQPOTAMIA.Looal punitive operations are now being; carried out by the columns in Middle and Lower Euphrates to continue pressure on the tribes till they submit in the area now occupied.    Subsequent intention is to operate from north and south in the area between Hill ah and Samawa.    To reduce some insurgent tribes who have not submitted, operations will be carried out shortly between Diyala river and Mendati by small Infantry column with proportionate cavalry and artillery, and a cavalry column with guns.PERSIA.The British Officer sent to Resht to observe the recent operations reports that there were no sanguinary combats, which Starosselski alleges he has waged, and that the Cossacks had not been seriously attacked and suffered no casualties whereas they were the superior fotfoe.   Starosselski is also   strongly suspected of having appropriated a considerable portion of the money supplied for the expenses of the expedition.The dismissal of Starosselski and the Russian Officers was demanded end after a considerable amount of vacillation the Shah acquiesced, but the Government, although not at all friendly to Starosselski, felt, that their position was intolerable and the:/ consequently resigned.    The forma^ tion of a new Government by Sipahdar-i-Aaam is likely to bake place.     Sipahdar-i-Azam has guaranteed to adopt the attitude of his predecessor so far as endeavouring to get the Anglo-Persian Agreement signed at the earliest possible date.FINLAND.It is reported from Helsingfors that the Russians are sending only 40 British subjects to the frontier for exchange Instead of the 80 foreshadowed by Tohitcherin.     The Bolsheviks may intend to insist on a personal exchange, and therefore may turn all our people back unless Rabushkin and party are allowed to cross.SOVIET RUSSIA
- Q *-SOVIET   ROSSI A.The general exchange of prisoners is proceeding. There is no definite1&apos; news of Ba,ku negotiations, hut the representation of delay brought by H.M. Government to JT. Eras sin&apos;s notice has so far resulted in the Soviet Government bringing further pressure to hear on the Azer- &apos; hai^an Government. &quot;   Prisoners of War from Central Russia are being collected at the Finnish frontier.SOUTH RUSSIA.On 20th October V/r angel held approximately the line Berdyansk - Pologi ^ Alexandrovsk Railway, thence along the left hank of the Dnieper to the sea, except for a bridgehead held by the Bolsheviks at Kakhovka, 45 miles up river from Kherson.    At the beginning of August his rifle and sabre strength was between 40 and 50,000;   total ration strength,&apos; including civilians employed by the army, approximately 209,000.    Bolshevik prisoners are allowed to enlist in units, but only up to a certain proportion.    The Fighting strength of Bolshevik troops opposing Wrangel is estimated at 58,600.     The morafc of Wranp-el&apos;s troops   is good, and since his recognition by France it has &quot;improved.     Arms and ammunition are   scarce and are obtained chiefly from captures from Bolsheviks.CAUCASIA.The Cossacks and Hill Tribes are in constant revolt against the Bolsheviks;   so far, however, these outbursts are not on a big scale, but only of a local nature.    Wrangol is endeavouring to organise this anti-Bolshevik movement.&apos;   In the whole of Caucasia the estimated Bolshevik rifle and sabre strength is 45,500.    Those, are fully occupied in maintaining their&quot;position in the country they occupy and In opposing Armenia.    Wrangel&apos;s efforts and the situation in is-Caucasia are undoubtedly giving the Soviet Government grave cause for anxiety, and it seems unlikely that the Rod Army will be able to spare appreciable re-inf ore orients for operations in Trans-Caucasia until that issue is settled.From Persian sources it is reported that the railway from Samara to Koine] has been cleared of bolsheviks, and that the latter have been ejected from the Astrakhan Area by local uprisings.    Red troops are stated to be in serious straits for clothing and food.SWEDEN.A new Cabinet has been formed.     It is considered that a friendly policy to Great Britain will be continued.POLAND.
POLAND.

General Zeligowski&apos;s Provisional Committee is still in power at Vilna. Marshal Pilsudski has sent an officer to the former to beg him not to come to blows with the Lithuanians. The Poles agree to the question being solved by a plebiscite conducted under the auspices of the League of Nations providing it is held speedily in the area occupied by General Zeligowski.

The Armistice and Preliminary Peace Treaty with the Soviets has been ratified by Poles and the Soviet Governments The exchange of ratifications should take place on November 2nd.

DANZIG.

The Polish Danzig Treaty should have been signed on 23rd October. The Poles asked at the last moment for the date to be extended 48 hours in order to enable them to discuss certain details direct with the Danzigers. This was granted but the Polish delegates opened questions of principles and not of detail. The Danzigers therefore refused to continue the negotiations and a temporary deadlock has resulted.

The Act constituting Danzig as a free city was signed on the 27th October, and it is hoped it will come into force on 15th November. It is being kept secret until the modifications to the Polish Danzig Treaty are concluded.

The Allied troops at Danzig will probably remain there for a few weeks after the establishment of the Treaty.

HUNGARY.

The time limit for ratifying the Peace Treaty has been extended until November 15th.

If the Hungarians have not ratified by this date their representatives on the various committees will not be allowed to sit.

CZECHO-SLOVAKA.

It appears that the Slovaks are becoming more rest? under the Czech authority.

ITALY.

The general political situation remains unsatisfactory and it is clear that Signor Giolitti&apos;s recent compromise with labour has effected nothing but a temporary settlement.

GREECE.

On the death of King Alexander, which took place on 25th October, the Greek Government decided to offer the crown to Prince Paul, the third son of the ex-King Constantine, and in the meantime to appoint Admiral Coundouriotis as regent.

It
It is understood that the aocession of Pri.noe Paul will bo conditional on tho abdication of ex-^ing Constantino and his eldest son, Prince George.The funeral of the late King Alexander took place on Friday 29th October.    H.M. Ships &quot;Concord&quot; and &quot;Centaur&quot; were present at the Piraeus.ATOM A.In North-Western Armenia the Armenian forces appear to have held all Turkish attempts to advance beyond Novo Selim and Igdir.in the meantime the Armenian Government is making an urgent appeal to Georgia to conclude a military defensive agreement.The Georgian Government, while expressing sympathy with Armenia and.expressing itself as willing to assist the Armenians in any possible way, is not prepared at present to commence hostilities against the Bolsheviks unless actually attacked by them.The Bolsheviks have meanwhile submitted an ultimatum to Armenia roquirinp the latter country to break with the Entente and to renounce the treaty of Sevres.    The Armenians have forwarded counter terms with, a view to keeping thosd negotiations running until an agreement is reached with Georgia and climatic conditions render the continuance of military operations on the Eastern frontier difficult.CILICIA.The press states that General Gouraud has commenced a fresh offensive against the Turkish Nationalists and has cleared, the Dorak region and the loop of the river Seihun.The Nationalist garrison of Aintab offered to capitulate under certain conditions, but the French demand unconditional surrender and are bombarding the town.
