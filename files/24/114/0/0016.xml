low rates on their private work), but, after consideration ofthe Report, the Minister of Labour put forward a proposal toamend the Pair &quot;rages -Resolution by the addition of thefollowing clause;-&quot;That Government Contracting Departments should &quot;exclude from the list of approved contractors, &quot;firms which have been shown to the satisfaction &quot;of the Departments ooncerned not to observe the &quot;principles of the Resolution as regards rates &quot;of wages or hours of labour in respect of either &quot;Government work or private work&quot;.This proposal, together with the views of various Departments thereon, was considered by the Home Affairs Committee of the Cabinet in august 1918 and that Committee, while agreeing generally that the proposal was in itself desirable, felt that nothing ought to be done at that time which might tend to increase the cost of Government Contracts.The matter was again the subject of consideration by the Pair V/ages Advisory Committee at their meeting on 15th January 1920 (and it was unanimously agreed that, the amendment of the Fair Wages Resolution by the addition of the Clause detailed above, should be prcceeded with, the Contracting Departments aocepting the view that their opposition had lost its foroe. It may be taken that all the Contracting Departments now -concur.I propose accordingly to arrange with the &quot;/hips for the allocation of the necessary parliamentary time for the amending Resolution.(Initialled) T.J.&amp;.iMinistry of Lab our,  7 th&quot; Qc ^ c beT&quot; 1*0 EQ.
