7   i . ,(THIS DOCUIFNT IS TH&quot; PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S DOCUMENT).COPY NO.SECRET * &quot;)CP.2002,&quot;&apos;&quot; CABIN    T.K:PFNDITU&quot;UPON TO&quot; CAMPAIGN IN GW:AN FAST AFRICA,Memorandum by- the, jhanoel^or of, the Efecheouer?:The Secretary of State for the Colonies invites His Majosty&apos;s Government to &quot;take a bTOad view&quot; of the. matter, &quot;breadth of view&quot; meaning in this case acquiescence in the repudiation of obligations undertaken by the Colonial Office on behalf of the Protectorates, and as in so many others accop-tance of the whole burden by the British taxpayer.Looking at the matter with a broad view I venture to point out that for the Colonial Office to set an example for repudiation of obligations on behalf of Protectorates for which they are responsible&apos;is quite likely to have a serious influence on the attitude of other parts cf the British Empire. The impressive spectacle of an Empire in arms, each part contributing its quota in men and money to the common effort, uould have a sorry epilogue if each part, headed by the Colonial Office, proceeded after peace to place its burden on the British taxpayer.   There are fen arguments stated in Lord-&quot; Milner!s paper which could not be applied to the Dominions or other Colonies,There is ono novel argument, (b) of Section III, that based on geographical propinquity to German territory.   Accord-ing to this argument, if I understand it, the nearer you are to Germany, and the more immediate your interest in Germanyls defeat, the less you ought to be called upon to pay for fighting. Is the Secretary of State prepared to press the converse of this argument on Mr, Hughes 1Argument (c) is a new version of the old saying that to him who hath shall be given.   Since tho British taxpayer is already over-burdened, what does it matter if you add to his load      Unfortunately this new version is becoming the common reading of the whole of Europe, but the Chancellor of the Exehe-quer may be permitted a pretest IThe argument (d) is that circumstances have been changed by the length of the vrar; the obvious reply is that they have been changed for the worse to Great Britain also by the same fact,       &apos; iArgument (e) can be adapted to the circumstances of every military operation in every theatre of Tfar,   Each had a bearing on the others, but the logical conclusion of the reasoning of the Secretary of State is a reductio ad absurdum of the argument itself, for it would be that, since the Empirers interests were everywhere involved, the United Kingdom alone should pay,
The only serious argument I suhm.it is (a) that it would be &quot;literally impossible for the Governments of Kenya, Uganda and Nyasaland to pay for the campaign beyond tho basis no^-&apos; proposed&quot;.   If this be true no other arguments are necessary.   But it is evidently open to exception for the last sentence of the narapiraoh suggests the obvious way of doing it, tho payment of an annual sum, though this, it is urged, would cripple the development of the Protectorates, It&quot; may be noted that tho Treasury have already agreed to place a Development loan of a million at the disposal of Lord JJ.lner for Uganda?   Kenya will be able to borrow on her own security for development *Nobody desires to crush the development of tho Protectorates by an overwhelming burden of debt, but something more definite must surely be given in the way of facts and figures before tho impossibility of paying anything beyond a sum based on the pre-war (1914) military estimates of each Protectorate as the maximum is accepted.The revenue raised by the three,Protectorates In 1920/21 will be between 4 and 4-?; millions,    A 10/&apos; increase m this, raising  450,000 a year would provide 5fr Interest on 9 millions,  &apos; &quot;&quot;bother this sum is leas or more than, the possible burden on the Protectorates if the bargain were carried out, it is not possible to say,I suggest that the first step is to ascertain the charge to the Protectorates under the Agreements and then, if it be found that the totals are excessive, to remit them to such a figure as the Protectorates can reasonably afford to pay,    -For this purpose It might be possible to adopt some rough and ready measure of dividing the Common Charges fund (say by ratio of Imperial to local forces engaged in Fast Africa) and then if it wore found that the resultant charge to the Protectorates involved an impossible hur.de.ri of debt to make a remission.A.C. 22/10,
