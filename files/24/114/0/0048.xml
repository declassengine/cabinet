(This Document is the Property ofHis Britannic Majesty^ Govern&quot;*t70py No.CvP(1-8043.0 A B I N E T.LEAGUE OP NATIONS, AHWENIA.Report presented to and adopted by the Council of the league of nations meeting in Brussels, October 1920.(Giroulated fo r Info rma ti o n).At their meeting in Paris last month the Oouicil of the League of Nations decided to enquire of the Supreme Council whether it was their desire that any communication should &quot;be made to the Assembly   of the League at its forthcoming meeting in regard to the questions of aiding the Armenian poop.5 financially in their preyont difficulties.The Supreme Council has, however, not recently been in session, and no reply has boon received to tho enquiry made to thorn.Meantime several letters have been received from the Armenian authorities indicating a very serious state of affairs.     They inform us that the Armeni/n population is being&apos; subjected to violent attacks by irregular troops; and they appeal to tho League of Nations for protection.The Council, therefore, findf. itsolf confronted with a double request from this struggling nation:-(1)   It is asked to supply financial assistance; (2)   It is aspect to give military aid, or by someother means to ensure security against attacks.Both these problems are further complicated by the facNt that it is not yet known what are to be the future boundaries of the State of Armenia.     These, President Wilson, at the. request, of the Supreme Council, has undertaken to determine but the work has not yet been carried out* .
As regards the question of a loan, we all know that most of tho Governments of the world are gravely pro-occupied by the existing conditions of their finances, arid it scorns very doubtful whether any of them would be prepared to add to their burdens by becoming guarantors of a new loan to any foreign State.     This does not, however, mean that they will cease to furnish Armenia with munitions and other necessaries to en-able her to carry en a defensive war.As regards tho second point, namely, the appeal by Armenia for military aid, it is my duty to point out that this, in existing circumstances, can only be provided either by the Allied and Associated Powers, or by some Mandatory acting on behalf of the League of Nations,     Tho League of Nations itself is powerless to deal with bandits who own no allegiance to any organised Government.     It has neither troops nor police at its command.   It cannot u^e force;   economic pressure has no terror for thoSQ who live by plunder;   and to the public of the civilisation world such people are quite Indifferent.   For the League to hold out hopes that it was prepared to undertake military operations In these remote and Inaccessible regions would be a most cruel Idndness to this hardly tried people.One possibility alone remains.   The League has already offered to do its best to find a Mandatory for Armenia.     This offer we might repeat at tho forthcoming meeting cf the Assembly, and, -in the meantime, we should forward the appeal of the Armenian Authorities to the Supreme Council5&quot;?.:! tho hope that the Four Powers may be able to take some iiteps to alleviate tho position of this unhappy people.a   See C.P.-20S5.2 Whitehall Gardens, 8,1-7. 2nd November, 19 20,
