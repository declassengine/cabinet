The settlement of the strike did not take place sufficiently early for any general resumption of work this week, but it is hoped that recovery in most industries will be reported within the next fortnight, and that the figures of unemployment will be reduced next week. Employers in many cases are only awaiting supplies of fuel to re-start work. In the steel and glass industries resumption of work will take longer, owing to the effects of the damping down process on the plant.Apart from the coal strike, depression continues in textiles, wholesale clothing, boot and shoe and leather trades, but there are signs of revival in cotton industry, and also in ship-repairing.Considerable slackness also prevails in engineering and motor industries, where a large number of workpeople are on short time.Work at the London Docks is very slack.
