&apos;   114(THIS, DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITAMUC MAJESTY1 S Qf(VERBMEBT1IT&apos;   COTOOTTIAJip Copy !Jo. vDr cab i it e t.league  OF   NATIONS,P 0 LA IS, Mote by the Coo retary.The enclosed copy of a letter from Mr. Balfour to Lord curzon has been sent to me with the request that it may bo circulated to the Cabinet.(Signed)     l .P.A.HANm.Z Whitehall Gardens&quot;, S.V/,1,  5th October, 1930.Copy of lettor from Mr. BajLfour^to Lord Our-zda.palace JJv, b*?l,22nd October, 1920.dear George,I write about Poland in the interval of violent fight in the Council on quite different subjects.     But 1 must have your help and opinion, if possible, by Saturday night, for vse are to have a private and informal conversation on Sunday;   and we are to meet the Polish and Lithuanian delegates on Monday.The situation, as wo understand it here, is as follows the Poles are deliberately trying to occupy as much . as possible of Lithuania for a variety of reasons:(a) They don:t want to disband their army;(b) They are in want of Lithuanian food-stuffs.(c) They want to face the Council with tho accomplished fact; - the accomplished faot in this case meaning the practical destruction of Lithuania as a soparato country;its
its fin-forced subordination as an Ally of inferior status to Poland; and tho separation of Yilna from the rest of Lithuania. ^I hear rumours also, more or less wall authenticated, that the Qusi d&apos;0raay would like, as,far as it decently, or indecently, can, to support the Poles;   and though quite con-soious of tho difficulty of doing this without destroying tho League of Rations la the operation, think that perhaps some formula might be devised which might satisfy the appetites of the Poles without too violently Injuring the feelings and reputations of the League of Nations.   -Bertholot is alleged to have said as much in quite unmistakable language.This being the situation, wh--.t is to be done? It is quite clear that the Polish scheme, backed, if it be backed, by the French, would ruin the position for over o,? the league of nations. lieutrsl States end America are olosoly watching our procedure, *i.ad will probably pass their final judgment on us according to its results. We are therefore face to face with world issues.asThe easiest way out which has/yat been su^ested is the following:-It seems that the Poles and Lithuanians    to oay nothing of the Polish pirate3 now In occupation of Yilna -have publicly declared thsir desire to processes the Yilna question settled by a plebescite of the inhabitants, - the Poles probably hoping thet, even if the majority of the population is reslly gainst them, their military occupation of the  . town will ma.ee tho vote $0 in their favour, while: the Lithuanians, rightly or wrongly, believe that either out of love of them, or hatred of the Poles, a majority of votes v,ill be cyst in their favour.How
Now it ia quite evldeirlrthat &quot;the- ixiebomLtc plan (if otherwiaa-i^S-i^rable)&quot;&apos; can only be carried out if tho ^ol^^genuinaly leave Vilna, and if the whole operation is carried out u dor %he auGpieos of the Loaguo of Nations, or the Allied and Associated Powers.The first question I have tot to ask the Cabinet is whether they desire me to pro. s the plebiscite scheme upon the Council,   There may be many objections to it;   but it-has the enormous advantage of being a plan which neither the French for one reason, nor the Poles for another, can openly oppose.     If they did oppose it, and if per im-possibilo Bourgeois held oat to the day of the public meeting, his position would be so impossible that I think he would either resign or cc-crco   his Government.    I cannot even contemplate so extraordinary a position as my having to get up before the public, and explain the proposal which I had made, adding that, owing to French opposition, I had not been able to carry it through the Council.I am therefore confident that if that is the position which you in Downing Street wish me to t* ke up4 I can never be driven out of it by a frontal attack.   AH that could be done by our opponents would be to try and defeat it by introducing such provisions and limitations as would mai:e the plebescite no true test of popular opinion.The only doubts I have upon the policy are due to my imperfect knowledge of the local situation.   3 do not know   whether the Lithuanians are right In suppling that a fair vote would give Vilna to them;- and I do not ..now whether, if it did   not, all prospects would be lost of. making Lithuania a prosperous and permanent political unit.These
1*    117These points I hope you will consider, and if you think thero is any alternative scheme to the ono I   roposo, I hope you will let me know as soon as possible what it is,A subsidiary, but very important, Question is what threats wo are in a position to hold out to the Poles in the event of their proving recalcitrant.   Tho mildest weapon in our armoury it? to oxpol thorn, or threaten to oxpol thorn, from the League.     Tho Council could do this (l) if it were unanimous;   ( ) if it could be shown that Poland had technically violated the letter of the Covenant, as she i3 undoubtedly violating its spirit;   or (3) under the very general phraseology of ^rticlo 11.     Tho Assembly has similar powers;   but I fancy could only exercise them by a unanimous vote.Yours, (Initialled)     A* J^B.
