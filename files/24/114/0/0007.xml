1*&apos; Blind Persons Act, 1920.     On the 10th September the Blind Persons Act, 1920, came into operation.     Under Section 1 of this Act, the statutory age for the receipt of an old age pension in the case of a person who is &quot;so blind as to be unable to perform any work for which eyesight is essential&quot; is reduced from 70 to 50.   Under Section 2 of the Act, a duty is imposed upon County aid County 3orough Councils (including the Common Council of the City of London) to submit to the Minister of Health within 12 months from the passing of the Act a satisfactory scheme for the welfare of the blind in their areas.     Section 3 of the Act re-enacts and applies, with certain modifications, the &apos;/Jar Charities Act, 1916, to charities for the blind.2t   FoodsThe Inter-departmental Committee appointed to consider the question whether it was desirable that Regulations should, be made under the Public Health (Regulations as to Food.) Act, 1907, prescribing standards of quality for, and regulating the sale of, condensed, milk, have now made their Report, which is under consideration.,III.. GEKtSJRAL...1.   Poor Law.   Representations are being made from an increasing number of Urban Unions that unemployment is increasing and that distress, possibly on a wide scale, is Imminent.The drawing of inferences from the current figures received in tte Ministry is made more difficult by the fact that pauperism at the end of the war was at a very low figure, which,.though it has since been steadily rising, is still nowhere near the normal pre-war figure.
The figures do not suggest that up to the present at any rate unemployment Is leading to any considerable number of applications for relief,It is noteworthy that in lieu of the usual summer decline in numbers there has this year been a practically constant, if slow, increase throughout the summer months. This increase is no doubt connected with the position of employment; for&apos;example, with bad employment there is a greater tendency to seek pootf .le* relief in sickness, but no exact relation can be shown.Where the only ground on which relief is sought is unemployment and the Guardians propose to give outdoor relief, the cases have to be reported to the Central Authority.The only Unions from which appreciable numbers of cases are being reported are Newcastle-on-Tyne, St. Pancras, Poplar, Brighton, Poole, Redruth and Swansea.     The total number of cases (including renewals) in which relief is being given is well under 200.2.     Increase of Local Rates,   The increase of local rates, mentioned on pages 6 and 7 of the Report for June, has become more marked with the settlement by the local authorities of their estimates for the second, half of the financial year.   The amounts per pound of rateable value of the rates for the years 1918-19 and 1920-21 respectively are given below for some of the London Boroughs as examples: &apos;Boroughs,	Mount		per pound of	Increase	rateabl		e   value,of	two years	rate	ts f	or year		1916		1920-.21.		s.		s.&apos; d.	s *   d.	11	6	19.   9	8    3Bethnal Green.....	10	1	19   11	9   10,	13	7	22   10	9     3	10	1	18     0	7   11	8	8	12     9	4     1City of London...,	7	3	10     6	3     3Similar increases are reported from other parts of the country.
Enquiries have been made as to the principal causes of the increases, and it is proposed to lay particulars before Parliament.      Shortly stated, the case for the local authorities, so far as disclosed by the replies already received, is as follows. The purchasing power of moneyhaving diminished, more of it has to be paid for the services rendered to the authorities and for tho materials used by them. The increased, receipts from grants, fees, rents, and other non-rate sources, and. savings by economies, being insufficient to meet the increase in payments, the ratepayers have to be asked for more money to make good the deficiency.      The rateable value of the dwelling-houses and other properties, upon which the amount of rates is leviable, has been almost stationary, and consequently the increased amount required from the ratepayers has necessarily to take the form of an increased amount per pound of rateable value.Increases in wages and salaries of employees (police,teachers, nurses, roadmen, clerks, etc. account for thegreater part of the increase in payments.     Increases in thecost of materials (into which increases of wages and salariesalso enter) accotint for-a large part of the balance.      Itemsaccounting to a smaller degree for the increase are :-provision made for increased working balances, provision made for overtaking arrears of work(especially repairs of highways and buildings) which were allowed to accumulate during the war, and provision made for new work.
