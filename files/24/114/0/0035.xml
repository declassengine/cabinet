M..- 1st November 1920.20 6I.-Extracts from Government of India Telegrams.jX i?1:^&apos; 3rd September.&quot; Considerable interest aroused by announcement of recommendations of Corn-mission on Egypt. In some quarters it is described as first victory of Islam, and in others, for example, Independent (Allahabad), as master stroke of policy, and certain to increase menace to India&apos;s freedom and future ; but while complicating course of evolution of national freedom in India likely to impart new inspiration and strength to Nationalist movement, and call forth determination of people to win legitimate freedom without waiting upon pleasure of British politicians, but forcing their hands to do the same thing by India as by Egypt.&quot;lQtli September.&quot; The tone of the Press everywhere continues to be violent; regret expressed at Turkey&apos;s signature of peace terms, and view frankly held, especially by Independent, that Independence of Egypt should lead to India&apos;s separation from British Empire, withdrawal of Egypt materially weakeuing Indians position as member of - common-wealth of white nations.&quot;&quot; 18th September. &quot; Ehilafat Conference.   Chief resolutions as follows : . . . . (.10) [the last] congratulates Egypt on securing national independence by constant agitation and sacrifice.&quot;2ith October.&quot;5. Bengal.....More serious development is formation of body of100 volunteers professing themselves ready to sacrifice lives in cause of community. Scheme avowedly borrowed from Egypt and Ireland with object of committing overt acts, such as cutting telegraph wires and upsetting railway trains.&quot;II.-Local Governments&apos; Remarks on Effects of the Egyptian Settlement.Extract from a Letter from the United Provinces, dated 16t/i September 1920.The Press. The Muslim Press continued its unrestrained comment on the Turkish peace terms. The Leader said that the agreement with Egypt was honour-able to both sides. The Independent asserted that Britain had. been compelled to capitulate and that India should take a lesson from the Egyptians. The immediate result, it said, of the recognition, of Egyptian independence upon Indian political opinion will be to create a similar demand here, and put the older idea, or ideal, of self-government within the Empire, more and more into the background. Tha Oudh -Ahhbar and the Medina exhorted Indians to take a lesson from the event which is the outcome of union among the various Egyptian communities, and their adherence, to non-co-operation.Extract from a Letter from Bihar, dated 17th September 192Q.The report of the settlement of the Egyptian question which appeared in the Times towards the end of August has been the subject ol a good deal of discussion. It is doubtful whether the full significance of the event has yet been fully realised, 2618     100  11.20
but undoubtedly the effect must bo to make the position of the Moderates more difficult, and to encourage the Extremists in their agitation for the complete independence of India.*&apos;!** *&apos;!* &apos;ut M. Press. The subject of Egyptian independence has evoked a good deal of comment. The Searchlight asks by &quot;what methods has this been gained,&quot; and finds the answer in a policy of united opposition to the Government.Extract from the Fortnightly Report on the Political Situation in the Central Provinces anal Berar for the fortnight ending the loth September 1920.Press. The grant of a constitution to Egypt has attracted much attention in the Press. While the moderate organs regard the grant as an example of British statesmanship, which will ultimately have its reaction in India, the extremist section of the Press describes it as a triumph of the policy of systematic non-co-operation.   ,Extract from the Report on the Political and Economic Situation in the Punjab for the fortnight ending the 3 bth September 1920.The recognition of Egyptian independence has called forth copious comment. The Partab says that Government should grant Indians their rights in order to prevent the conversion of India into a second Egypt or Ireland.III.-Specimen Selections of Newspaper Articles on the Egyptian Settlement and itsbearing on India.Independent, 31s/; August 1920.The Independent (Allahabad) of the 31st August 1920 has an article headed &quot; How Egypt won her Independence,&quot; by the Hon. Mr. V. J. Patel.The conversion of Egypt into an honoured and honourable Ally has, it is feared, been forced on Britain by considerations of the effective pursuit of its policy of consolidating the self-governing Empire with a view to the governance of and the exploitation of the dependent Empire. This being the case Indians must boldly ask and fight for their recognition as an independent State in friendly alliance with the United Kingdom and her overseas brood. .   ,Democrat, bth September 1920.The Democrat (Allahabad) of the 5th September 1920 has an article by Manzar Ali Sokhta on the &quot; Independence of Egypt.&quot; The writer says that the announcement must have sent a&quot;thrill through West and East; the former seeing in it the fulfilment of its long-cherished design of converting Egypt into an &quot; Oriental Belgium,&quot; the East as the dawn of a new era. &quot; Europe like a harpy with brazen claws has held it &quot;in helpless bondage and like a vampire continuously sucked the blood of its -&apos; unhappy victim.&quot;The writer continues, the disastrous termination of the wrar made the position worse, as the balance of power which meant security for the East was upset, and England and France remain supreme. &quot;As an inevitable result there followed the &quot; immediate destruction of the Turkish Empire, and a desperate, cold-blooded, cruel &quot;attempt to enslave Persia, Mesopotamia, Arabia, Egypt and the rest.&quot; The war thus ushered in a new era of tribulation for the East and its hopes of emancipation seemed on the point of vanishing.The recognition of the independence of Egypt, however, proves to the world that the might of the mightiest Empire is impotent before the will of a determined people. It is not in a fit of superhuman philanthropy that England is consenting to enter into a &quot; Treaty of Alliance &quot; with her recent thrall. From the time of her earliest con-nection with the country up to the last England has been straining every nerve to maintain her dominance intact over the Egyptian people, by the terrible military resources of her wide Empire.
Now England stands aghast and impotent before the liny Egyptian nation. &quot;The &quot; Imperial prestige, to maintain which enough of human blood has been shed to enable &quot; the whole British nation to swim in, lies low in the dust, humiliated, pained, broken &quot; -and the will of an Eastern people, tiny, unarmed, and helpless, is seen, to triumph &quot; over all the organised militarism of the West. It is a spectacle which is bound to &quot; revolutionise human history. It is the death knell to the imperialistic era ; inspired. &quot; by the example of Egypt, the East will know now how to work its salvation.&quot;Bombay Chronicle, [)th September 1920.Referring to the Pioneer s remarks about the grant of independence to Egypt, the Bombay Chronicle writes : &quot; It (the Pioneer) is mortally afraid of the contingency &quot; of the adoption of non-cooperation in India on (he Egyptian model, but modified-&quot; according to the circumstances of this country. Its main underlying object is to &quot; show that non-co-operation has not succeeded in Egypt and that what Egypt has &quot; now got, tho Milner Commission would have given it long ago. India is not so &quot; blind as the Pioneer takes it to be. It knows how Britain,&apos; in flagrant violation- of &quot;the promise given by His Majesty the King Emperor, sought to hold&apos; Egypt &quot; permanently as a Protectorate even after the war, and how nobly Egypt struggled &quot; and freed itself from the grip of Britain. The Milner Commission went to Egypt, &quot; and it would have blessed the country with another Mont ford scheme, it&apos; it could &quot; have got from any section even a semblance of co-operation. But Egypt was in no &quot; way to be tempted. The lesson conveyed by the Egyptian example has been fully &quot; grasped by India ; the value and efficacy of non-co-operation have been fully brought &quot;home to it. . . . The only question is whether India is to pass through the &quot; agony and sufferings of Egypt or whether Britain, profiting by the case of Egypt, &quot; will prevent them by a timely grant of full autonomy.&quot;Siyasat:, Lahore, 3rd September 1920.Writing about the recognition of the independence of Egypt, the Siyasat of the 3rd September says that the success achieved by her is a&apos;splendid victory for non-co-operation. It should not be understood, however, that the Egyptians have obtained&apos; complete independence. To make a promise or to enter into an agreement is one thing, but it is quite a different thing to fulfil it. So long as the English are in possession of the Suez Canal, the independence of Egypt will be in danger. They will covertly use every means to keep her in the bonds of slavery.^ The day is not far off, however, when, by the grace of God, the Suez Canal will pass into the hands of the Muhammadans. The independence of Egypt is the first step towards the regeneration of Islam. It is now for the Indian Muhammadans to gain liberty for themselves by resorting to non-co-operation with Government. &apos;;&quot;Sidaqat, Lahone, 8th September 1920.The Sidaqat of the 8th September says that Mr. Lloyd George and his colleagues&apos; deserve no congratulations on the recognition of Egyptian independence. &apos; So far from granting independence to Egypt spontaneously, Great Britain has been forced to do so because of the Egyptians&apos; dreadful extremism. Mr. Lloyd George has taught to Asia the lesson that only those nations which can use the bomb, the pistol and1 secret forces, and thereby produce a powerful effect, can obtain freedom from Britain. As compared with the Europeans, the Asiatics are dull, stupid and slow, but if all of them follow the lesson taught them by their teacher, Lloyd George, their stupidity will make trouble for Europe in, Asia. The Arab pupils of- Lawrence are displaying their fighting capacity in Mesopotamia, which can be appreciated only by the British officers besieged at Kufa. Lloyd George has done to-day what was suggested, by Muhammad Ali. in the Comrade five years ago, although after much mischief lias been wrought.Swadesamitran, Madras, 25th Augiist 1920.Referring to the news that the British Government have recognised the independ-ence of Egypt and&apos;agreed to conclude a treaty with it, the Swadesamitran of&apos; the 25th, August traces the history of Egypt from the time when it was an independent country 2618 A 2
and, describing how the British entered into it originally to safeguard the position of Europeans and other foreigners there and stayed there permanently to protect Egypt, how British statesmen have been assuring from time to time they would withdraw, how the British sought the co-operation of France in administering Egypt, which she declined, how the British, &quot; who are always intent upon furthering their own interests at a crisis,&quot; obtained the consent of France to make Egypt a dependency of England, in lieu of the help France required of her during the great war, how they took advantage of the then King of Egypt having joined Turkey and left the place, to dethrone him and. appoint a relation of his as the King, how, in spite of the apprecia-tion by British statesmen of the services rendered by Egypt in the war, they were not prepared to grant the right of self-determination to her, how, on comiqg to know this, the people of Egypt raised a strong agitation, which could not be curbed by the repressive policy adopted by the British authorities, how, in spite of the clamour of the Egyptians, the Peace Conference decided that Egypt was a dependency of Britain, which wras also resented by the Egyptians, how the Milner Commission, appointed to enquire into and report upon what type of Government could be introduced in Egypt to keep it under the control of the British, was not able to do much and how the British have now come to a settlement in consultation with the very Suklul Pasha, whom they once treated with contempt and deported to Malta, observes: It is certain that the British Government have now agreed to grant Egypt a better system of administration than what was implied in their announcement in November last, that they were working for the introduction of responsible Government in Egypt step by step.   What is the reason for this victory of the Egyptians ?   There are no parties in Egypt and all people are nationalists.   Though the British authorities tried to gain over the Christians there to.their side, they did not succeed and the Christians declared unanimously that they did not want anything else than complete inde-pendence.   Even we could have attained indepencence at least subject to the Empire. But all of us had not the strength of mind to avoid falling victims to the tricks played by the authorities.   As a few among us, caring for the name of moderates, fell into the net of the authorities and betrayed the country, the authorities offered us Home Rule step by step and, dividing the first step into two, have given us a small piece of it, leaving.the necessary powers in the hands of those having the other piece.   In his articles to the London Times about Egypt, Sir Valentine Chirol has expressed his appreciation of the Indian.Home Rule movement.   In the Home Pule agitation in 1916-17, we stood unitedly and therein lay our strength.   The authorities had not the power to. oppose this.   So, as soon as Mr. Montagu set foot in India, he tried to create a.faction and thereby reduce our strength, so as to achieve his object.   He succeeded in his efforts and the demands of the Congress have not been granted.   It is the moderates that are responsible for this.   If they realise their mistake at least now and co-operate with the nationalists, we can also attain independence like Egypt.Gujardti, 29th August 1920.The Egyptians have, triumphed at last, and Britain has recognised the inclepen-dence of Egypt. It is expected that Ireland will be similarly dealt with. Will India alone be left to bear the yoke of subordination ? &apos; India needs to be more wakeful. Strenuous efforts must be made to convert the present form of Government which is entirely under the control of foreign officials to one which would be responsible to Indians.Burma Observer, 25th September 1920.At last Egypt is free ! For once the Coalition Government has made good the plighted word of England and has acted on that principle of self-determination for which it proclaimed wre fought the war. Once again Englishmen may hold up their heads as members of a nation that does not always repudiate its promises, whose written poems are sometimes better than scraps of paper. But the victory has been hardly won. If the words that Lord Curzon spoke but yesterday meant anything, they meant a protectorate, i.e., the veiled annexation of Egypt, because it is &quot;the gateway into Africa.&quot; In plain language England was to steal Egypt-as she is trying to steal Mesopotamia-in the interests of &quot; big business,&quot; capitalism. All the speeches of the Ministers and the utterances of their led Press pointed the same way. Concerning Egyptian independence or English promises, inspired tongues were
silent. What has wrought this happy change ? Other reasons may come to light hereafter but the main, the essential reason is beyond doubt the determination and the courage of the Egyptian people. Basing their cause on the impregnable rocks of justice and good faith, they disdained any lesser goal than full independence. They refused, to be beguiled by talk of protectorate &quot;in their own interests.&quot; They spurned the idea that they were unfit to rule themselves, that they required to be &quot;trained&quot; for self-government. They stood out stiffly for freedom, &quot;and they have won.&quot;Here is a lesson that every Burman may learn. True, Egypt had a case that might not be gainsaid. England had plighted her word not once, but fifty times over, that she should be free. But has not Burma an equally good cause ? Has she not the promise of 20th August 1917, a promise which the Government of India rightly interpreted as meaning that in all the Provinces of the Indian Empire the people, through their Ministers, should from the first have responsibility ? On that vantage ground she stands and demands her just rights. The Government of India, slighting this promise and trampling under foot English honour, has proposed a constitution that gives no Ministers drawing their power from the people or responsible to the people. (Some there be who, to uphold vested interests, hold pledges but as the idle wind, and honour as a garment that one puts off at will.) It seeks to give to the word &quot; analogous &quot; it forgets that Mr. Montagu also said &quot; similar &quot; a meaning which is not the English meaning. How shall men deal with a Government that repudiates promises and twists words from their plain meaning ? Who will trust it ? Who will believe it when it professes sympathy with the people ? Who will credit it when it says it desires that the Burmese shall rule themselves ? Only one course is open to the Burmese who have minds to understand. They must fight stubbornly, as the Egyptians fought, abating tio jot or tittle of their demand. They must fight on until Burma has at least that measure of self-government which has been granted to the Indian Provinces. No words, however sympathetic, no promises, however seductive, must beguile them to turn aside from the goal on which they are bent. Let us trust to facts and facts alone. Until the constitution which Burma demands has been finally granted let no Burman cease to strive or weaken in his work for Burma. We know those who withstand us; we know what is in their hearts. The same unity, the same high courage as Egypt showed, let Burma also show. So shall she triumph over the Government of India and those officials who, in their own interest, seek to bar her way. With the cry &quot; Who is for Burma ? Who is-for freedom,&quot; let her fight her way on to the promised land.
