No very large discharges are reported, however, and unemployment has not assumed, such serious proportions as might have been anticipated. The adoption of short time in many districts has prevented the discharge of workers. Stocks of coal in hand have proved larger than was expected. Unemployment is most serious among iron and steel workers, who are almost entirely idle. In the engineering industry, short time has prevented discharges. Trade depression continues in textile trades, boot and shoe industry, clothing and straw
hats. Some improvement in connection with ship repairing is reported both from the North and in Wales. The coal strike has retarded possible recovery in boot and shoe and leather trades.Summary of Reports of Works Closed, Staff Reduced, and Workpeople on short Time up to October 29, 1920.(Establishments employing 200 workpeople or over.)Industry.
