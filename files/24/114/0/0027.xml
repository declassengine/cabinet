The reduction from their normal wages to strike pay to-morrow will bring the seriousness of the position home to them.Unemployment is increasing rapidly; it will be a more serious menace this winter than labour disputesA meeting of the Building Trade Operatives&apos; Federation was held in Manchester on October 26th.   It was decided that the Government proposals to employ ex-Service men should not be accepted without more details and a ballot of members.   The proceedings appear to have been hilarious rather than serious.   Some of the delegates argued that the Government proposal is intended to smash the power of the Unions rather than to help ex-Service men, and fears were expressed that the Unions would have to support a larger number of unemployed if tho labour was diluted.On   Monday last a secret Bolshevik courier, for whom the police j)ave been looking for six months, was arrested as he came out of the flat occupied by Mr. Malone, M.P. with a number of doouisents whioh he was carrying to Russia.   T;;.ey throw great light upon the Communist organisation here.   Tua case will bo heard at Bow Street next Tuesday. Aiuong the documents was one showing that  300 h?;.d one spent for corrupting the Letter Dock,There/
There has been&quot;some reaction in.the provinces against the extremists in the Unions who have had far more than their due share of influence hitherto.The extremists are working up a strong opposition to the Emergency Powers Bill on the cry that it is intended to smash Trade Unionism,   The Bill has the support of public opinion.Very violent spoeches continue tp be made. , ,ThQ need for legislation providing summary procedure for seditious speeches and -literature becomes more urgent every day.The circulation of the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; appears to have decreased about &quot;25$/ , , /,The death&apos;of the Lord Mayor&quot;of Cork has oroated but a languid interest in England.In Ireland there is slow but sure progress in re-establishing order.Sylvia Pankhurst was to-day1 sentenced to six months&apos; imprison ment in the second Division.&quot;
TBS COAL BERKS &apos;    &apos;Tho majority of the miners would welcome a settlement provided that, thay got increases at once.    Probably the extremists will oppose a settlement at the Delegates Conference on Friday if there is any question of output, and in that case the moderates will probably carry a resolution referring the terms to a ballot.While deploring the, financial loss occasioned by the strike, the&apos;general&apos;public is unshaken in its dislike of any concession to the miners, and there has been considerable anxiety lest the Government attitude should woaken.The men are still giedohumoured.&apos;   There have been several: oases v)f theft of growing vegetables, but the ialners appear to ^think that this is quite a proper form of ^ relaxation.   The farmers naturally abject to the loss sf vegetables and in some cases of poultry&quot;, but there have been m conflicts.   - The miners have also commandeered coal for themselves.The chief reason for the good order that has prevailed is that.the&quot;miners still have money and are guided by their leaders, rather than by extremists.    The discomfiture of the latter has been complete, for even in Lanarkshire, - where so much was&apos; heard&apos;of the BedJGuard, the movement for . th,e seizure&apos; of the mines has come to nothing, nor do the miners listen to the violent attacks made by revolutionary speakers on the Trade Union leaders.    There is, however, little doubt that in some districts, if the strike is not settled, all laUjpur will be withdrawn from the mines.UNSHPhOmNT   &apos; ........Unemployment, greatly aggravated by the.miners&apos; strike, is Increasing rapidly and will seriously threaten the stability of the&quot; country during the winter.    . The extremist attitude towards the problem is well put in the currentissue/
issue of the &quot;Workers1 Dreadnought&quot;, &quot;Why should a great body of hungry and ragged workers leave the East ;Snd to demonstrate in the-Weet End?    Are the food and clothing tf&apos; warehouses in the West End?    And the time is here when we must ask ourselves, why be looked out of our mines, ouj shops, works and factories?    Why be starved into submissi to the might of capitalism?    We must seize and work the productive machinery of the nation.&quot;This extract is typical of most extremist speeches; many revolutionaries demand- that factories should be taken by the workers to supply the needs of Russia and allege that private ownership is,the oause of all unemployment.Emery, who has issued a manifesto to the working class on behalf of the Coventry Unemployed Workers&apos; Committee, has aroused the resentment of local trade union officials, whom he is continually abusing.    They are accordingly forming an Amalgamated li&amp;engineering Union Unemployment Committee in order, to counteract his activitieAt Glasgow also there are rival unemployment committees, and John McLean, who was first in the field, has accordingly poured his customary torrent of inveotive over his opponents luesser, Gallaoher and Campbell.    These men, whose vocabulary is scarcely less ruddy than McLean1s have retaliated and it has been left to &quot;Sandy&quot; Ross to deplore the lack of unity.    His effort, however, was confined to a rlchauffe&apos; of the Watson case and allegations that Rothstein was a spy on the Labour movement.    This statement was disputed by Campbell, who said he had Gailacher&apos;s word for the fact that Lenin placed absolute trust in Rothstein.    This acrimonious meeting was held on Glasgow Green and was attended by 1,200 people.The London Labour Mayors are demanding an iramediate enquiry to ascertain who was responsible for giving the orders for the &quot;baton chargeM during the Whitehalldisturbance/
. a - .   198disturbance on October 18th.It is reported thet a demonstration of Camberwell unemployed which started&apos;to march&apos;to Downing Street on October 26th did not proceed, beyond Southwark Town Hall, where a meeting was held. REVOLUTIONARY ORGANISATION U GR&amp;AT BRITABThe arrest of the man who refuses his name, but is known to be the principal Bolshevik courier in this country, hae thrown much light on revolutionary organisation.   For more than six months it has been known that this man was responsible for the passages of stowaways to and from Russia and for bringing in funds and precious stones.    He was closely associated with Sylvia Pankhurst, with Theodore Rothstein and with ex-Colonel Malone, and extraordinary precautions were taken by them to conceal his identity and to prevent his oapture.    He was arrested when leaving Malone&apos;s flat with all his letters for Russia upon him.    The adjourned case will be heard next, Tuesday and it is intended to oall Malone as a witness for the Prosocution.    When seen by a Police officer yesterday morning he showed considerable agitation.Evidence is accumulating against Malone.    The revolutionaries regard him as the &quot;brains&quot; of the movement. Recently he went the length of promising a seat in the next Parliament, &quot;which would be a Communist one&quot;, to an ex-Officer.of the Royal Air Force, whom he and Rease were urging to join the movement.    Hease added thet the party urgently required airmen and that the ex-Officer was just the kind of man they wanted &quot;behind the soenes&quot;.    There is good reason for believing that plans for the training of Red Army officers are oomplete.    Hease is on friendly terms with Krassin and Robert Williams.     Jack Tanner is forming classes for secret military drill among selected comrades, who will be trained to act as officers of theRed/
Red Army,    He hps thirty names on his list, and these men are ta take en oath of allegiance.Among the documents found uoon the courier was,one showing that  300 has  been spent for corrupting the Lowei Deck of the Royal Navy,In view o^ these -olans for organising a Red Army in England, attention is called to e pamphlet entitled &quot;The Dictatorship of the Proletariat&quot;, written by Kameneff apparently in June, 1920, and published by the Communist Party of Great Britain.    Among other things he says:-&quot;There can be no doubt that, at the moment of a-decisive class war, the power of command and compulsion must lie in the hands of a definite        [ ,   organisation....The army of the Proletariat, moving il battle order, must have its general staff...It must j possess equal authority over all kinds of arms at the disposition of the working class...1&apos;Ee goes on to describe exploiters, rich peasantry,engineers and bankers as the arch-enemies.TRADE UNIONS AND THE REVOLUTION    ; &apos; &apos;The past week hes: been a valuable test&apos; of the holdrevolution hss upon the great mass of Trade Unionists.The extremists are still a comparatively small&apos;body, butthey have acquired an influence altogether out of proportion to their numerical strength.     It is they whoattend meetings, they who make the speeches, they who      [. pass resolutions leading to strikes, but the great inert-mass lies sleeping like&apos;Gulliver until &quot;the uin-pricks-wake him up and he begins to lay about him.    This isexactly what happened in the threatened railway strike. As soon as the-great mass nf railwaymen&apos;realised that they. were to be ordered to strike against their &quot;will&apos; they madethemselves felt.     In Birkenhead and Liverpool they evenpassed resolutions condemning in&apos; strongest terms &quot;damnablestrikes&quot;, and the &quot;Bolshevik element&quot;, and in the former oathey/
they demanded   &quot;the immediate resignation of the extreme section of the Executive.&quot;The Wisbech branch of the Post Office Union has condemned the miners in strong terms and hts declared that it will not participate in a sympathetic strike.It is practically certain that British Labour is not yet prepared for a general strike with revolutionary aims, but as long as the object of the strike appears to be confined to a demand for increased wages a widespread cessation of work is not impossible. .  &apos;THE ASSOCIATED SOCIETY OF LOCOMOTIVE ENGINEIEN AND FIREMENThe indications of friction between the two railway unions are substantiated by the following letter, written by J. Bromley and sent to a branoh meeting of the associated Society of Locomotive Bnginemen and Firemen:&quot;Mr. Thomas  ome time before the miners&apos; strike started gave a personal undertaking to myself as your general secretary, that before the National Union of Railwaymen were in any way committed to a strike our Society would be advised and consulted.   But this your Executive have patiently waited for a fortnight or so, feeling confident that nothing serious would happen without them being consulted.   He came to London on Wednesday to be in close touch, but unfortunately, we were not approached, and only received a letter this morning (Oct. 22nd) giving the accomplished fact.   Your Executive issued a circular on the 15th instant, warning you to await your instructions.   In this consideration your Executive feel that they cannot, in fairness to you, call you out in this haphazard manner without you first being consulted as trade unionists.   The Executive Committee therefore instruct that each branch call a special meeting on -   Sunday to lay the position before the members and ask for a resolution of instruction to the Executive Committee, as to what action you desire to be taken . on your behalf; i.e. either a strike with the National Union of Railwaymen or not, and whether the Executive Committee may act on a majority decision of Sunday meetings or whether our members should be more fully consulted before action.&quot;It was stated at this meeting that a large majority of branobes of the Associated Society of Locomotive Engine-men and Firemen were opposed to striking before a ballot had been taken. BARTERING/
BABTlIiRING OF VOTES AT TRASSS UNION CONGRESSESThe report of the Committee appointed to investiga the alleged bartering of votes in the election of the Parliamentary Committee has been signed by C. T. Cramp, Robert Williams, J. Bromley, Herbert Smith and George B It states that there is abundant evidence that systemat oanvassing and bartering has been carried on for many yj behind the backs of the delegates, and that if the ruld were applied rigorously more than half of the membership of affiliated unions would be disqualified from represen] for at least three years.   The report advises that thef;- EPortsmouth Committee be allowed to remain in office and that the Parliamentary Committee will issue a special warning that the standing orders will be rigidly enf arceiTHE EMERGENCY POWERS BILLThere is little doubt that public opinion will suppol the Emergency Powers.Bill although labour leaders as welll agitators will endeavour to represent the measure as an attack on Trade Unionism.   The &quot;Daily Herald&quot; is of ooural in the van with a large heading &quot;Bill to smash Trade Unioi /Adverse comment on the license allowed to extremist speakers)is beooming very noticeable and the measure may constitute an answer to the oharge that the Government is afraid to take action.   On October 24th many people in Trafalgar Square expressed astonishment that the Governmenl did not suppress suoh meetings, especially in the present crisis.THE COMMUNIST PARTx 01* GREAT BRITAINThe proposal to appoint representatives of the Communi Party of Great Britain to the National &quot;Hands off Russia&quot;Committee/
Committee, which has now moved its secretariat to London, has resulted in an invitation to A. A, Watts, F. L. Kerran, W. MoLaine and W, H. Kyle to serve.The party reports that negotiations are almost complete for a &quot;suite of suitable offices centrally situated in London&quot;, but meanwhile the Finance Committee has been instructed to put in hand a general app&apos;eal for funds, and divisional organisers are to assist in securing the regular payment of the Headquarters levy and general branch accounts.The Parliamentary Committee has arranged to meet regularly during the session , to go through the&apos;order of Parliamentary business for the ensuing week, &quot;to advise Maione on matters that could be effectively raised in the House of Commons &amp;nd to assist in the drafting of questions.&quot;COMMUNIST MEETING Ijj TRAFALGAR SQUARE ...On October 24th the attendance at the Trafalgar Square meeting convened by Miss Sylvia Pankhursfs Communist group varied from 500 to 1,000.   The speakers dealt chiefly with the mining crisis and the following extracts are typioal: Edgar Wh1tehead:&quot;We&apos;dc not face such a strike mainly from the point of view of a wage increase or an hourTs reduction, but we view a strike of this character more as a symptom of the class struggle.   We support and encourage such strikes because such strikes are in themselves symptoms of the class struggle.&quot; . Minnie Birch;&quot;What I want now is to try to get as many workers aspossible/
M      3      *&quot;possible to take advantage of the situation ... I hope that this struggle is going to lead to a strike, not merely for higher wages but a strike for the control of industry ... We have not only to bring the Government to its knees ... We have got to turn the Government out and put a Soviet in its stead.&quot; Bishop:&quot;Parliament is useless.   We realise that Parliament is nothing and nothing less than the expropriation of the means of production, distribution and exchange, taking all they have away from the landlords and giving it to the rightful owners, the working classes of the world - this is the only solution of the difficulties that face the working classes to-day.&quot; John Steele:&quot;You cmnot destroy the wages system until you destroy the capitalist system.   You can do so by forcibly seizing political power; you can do so by foroibly taking and holdingl the railways, factories and mines.&quot; Thomas:&quot;You are robbed at the point of production; you are robbed in the factory and the workshop; you are robbed in the coal mine; then here is the place that the working class shoul concentrate cn for its organisation.   You are not robbed at Westminster, the only wealth that is produced there is poison gas.   Then wh^, in the name of goodness, should the working class look to Westminster for emancipation?   The unconditional surrender of the capitalist class is the only method by which peace can be established ... Let us march under the &quot;Red Hag the symbol of liberty.&quot; COVENTRY COUNCIL Of iCTIOflThe quarterly meeting of the Coventry and DistrictCo-operative/
Co-operative Society have decided &quot;by 116 to 74 votes not to appoint a representative to the looal oouncil of actian.   Of the Coventry delegates, 72 vote* against the motion and 67 for it.   It is stated, however* that the extremist Mabbs, who is president of the looal council of aotion, has. in spits of opposition, come to a working agreement with the Co-operative Society.The extremists in this district have almost obtained control of the Co-operative Society but the steadier elements are now taking greater interest.FEELING AMONG      SERVICE WBeyond the usual bond on meetings there has been no specialactivity among ex-Service man during the week.   Jones speaksalmost daily and his remarks are frank incitement to robbery.The following extract is taken from a speech made at Harlesdenon October 35th:&quot;I&apos;ve got a pair of brown hoots on which I pinched, my old ones let water.   The suit I have as you can sea is getting vary old.   I shall have a now one soon.   If anybody in the audienoe can tell mo where there are some nioe suits hanging outside a tailor&apos;s shop. I shall be much obliged. Do you think I should go hungry with all the good things I can sea in the shops.   If my neighbour, whether ha be poor er rich had two loaves, and I was hungry, I would pinch one. To-morrow m shall have a meeting here at 7 o1clock.  At 7*80 we shall march to the Ratepayers&apos; Meeting at Dyne ftoad, and see what they will do for us.   We want to impress them, so bring sticks, or the kitchen poker will do.  Your member for Willesden is a hypocrite.   Some of you boys ought to march to his house and ask him for money.   If he doesnTt give you any, give him a poke under the jaw.&apos;1A. 5. M&amp;nder has appealed to members of the National Union of Ex-Service Men &quot;not to be trapped&quot; by Sari Haig&apos;s circular. &quot;If the workers are about to be involved in a general conflict with the privileged class, every branch, of the National Union of Sx-Service Mm knows its duty and will do it.&quot;Many members of the National Union of ^-Service Men have not served with the Forces and are hooligans of a low type.An/
An-example-of the laxity rogaWir%&apos;Conditions of member ship&quot;&quot; it !was supplied by $om Dingley at Coventry, where he said on .. October SOth, &quot;I am not an ex-Service man and have not been in the Army, but I am proud to be.a.member of the National Union of Ex-Service Men,   I have been accepted as a member for other work that I have done.1&apos;MR, AND MRS, WALTON NBpOIP AT LIVERPOOL- On October 24th Mrs. W&amp;ltoh Newbold, who has recently returned from Russia, and her husband addressed a meeting at Picton Hall, Liverpool, under the auspices of the Union of Democratic Control.   Only about 500 of the audience of 2,500 appeared to be in sympathy with the speakers, who were severely heckled.   Tho meeting ended in confusion owing to the Chairman&apos; statement that the Lord Mayor of Cork was dead.   A vote of .   condolence with his family was declared carried, although only 25$ of the assembly voted and&apos;there was no call for hands agains the motion.   There were cat calls and loud cries of &quot;Suicide&quot; and &quot;Traitor&quot;. ,   ^ \ &apos;        . -Walton Newbold devoted most of his remarks to an exposition of the..alleged financial interests of members of the Government but said in conclusion, in reference to the arrest of Sylvia Pankhurst that he hoped the Lower Deck\would hoist the &quot;Red Hag and carry out the communist&apos;idea. He would welcome the sight of the-red flag flying from battleships and over garrisons and urge the railwaymen, dockers arid every class of worker to come out in support of the miners and bring about a general strixe,Mrs. Newbold gave an account of her experiences in Russia, but when asked if she spoke Russian1 rep lied, *No, but a friend with me spoke German.- When we Interviewed any Russians we alw&amp;y found one who could speak German; he&quot; interpreted the Russian to my friend in German and she told&apos;me the result in English&quot;,   Her husband left the platform before question time.CONVICTIOH
m 11&quot; -   202CONVICTIONOn October 21st Michael 0&apos;MLly Simmington, to whom reference was made In my report Ho. 75, was convicted at the Central Criminal Court and sentenced to 15 months&apos; hard labour.THS &quot;DAILY HSRAIiD&quot;My Glasgow correspondent reports that the sales of the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; in his area have dropped about 10^ sinoe the price was raised to 2d.   At the looal Herald League office and at a wholesale newsagent&apos;a, it is stated that the sales have decreased by 85$ and that the paper can now be obtained only if ordered.   A street vendor in a crowded district stated that his sales average 50.dozen copies daily.   The &quot;Daily Herald&quot; Glasgow correspondent, Councillor Dollan, is said tobe paid a salary of 29 per week.The decrease in sales in the Midlands is now reported to be 25$.   The sales in the North Staffordshire pottery district amount to about 500 copies daily.&amp; SINN g IN IN GRliiAT B BIT A IN91There have so far been no untoward incidents as   the result of the Lord Mayor of Cork/s death, but a large demonstration will be held in Manchester on Sunday next. It is reported that the conviction of Simrmington has had a salutary effect in Sinn Pein circles.   Secretaries of branches of the Irish,Self-Determination League are arranging to keep their doouments in a safer place than lodgings.   The Irish elements in Balaam and Tooting are particularly active and a branch of the League has been formed in Deptford.On October 24th large Sinn I?ein demonstrations were held at Darwen and Newcastle; at the former, Mrs. Sheeny Skeffington alleged that military forces -would be used against the english working classes, if occasion arose, as they were used in Ireland. On/
On October 23rd a meeting of the Glasgow Sinn FeinExecutive was attended by representatives of 25 clubs.Two letters from the Executive in Dublin were read thankingthem for money sent and for their activity in recruiting and]a lengthy report was read regarding the success of Valerain America.   A dozen Sinn Fein Clubs sent donations towardsjequipping the Glasgow volunteers here.   Receipt of thefollowing sums *as intimated;Thomas Ashe Club, Anderston District. Glasgow     30 . Emmet Club, Parkhead, Glasgow  25M. Dononoe Club, Partick  33Plunkett Club, Clydebank  40It was resolved to organise a hostile reception for any Members of Parliament coming to Glasgow to address meetingj the searching of pedestrians by Sinn Fein Volunteers on thj roads, which had begun, is now to be discontinued.IRELAND225 outrages were reported during the week; of these 146 were directly attributable to Sinn Fein, 6 were due to agrarian motives and 73 were other serious outrages affeotj the peace of the country.   The last category shows a rath^j marked increase and includes five cases of murder.One soldier, two policemen and 13 civilians were kidnapped during the week but in most instances speedily released.The opinion that Sinn Fein is going to get the worstlthe struggle seeras to be growing, and reports from the proposal show a more hopeful feeling amongst loyalists and the polIt is also to be observed thVfc whereas for a long time pelonly three or* four recruits per week have joined the RoysjConstabulary from Ireland, last week and during the prececweek the numbers of Irish recruits from this country were)and 24 respectively.   If this continues it is significant!
Sinn Fein is doing its utmost to terrorise intending recruits.The illegal Sinn Fein courts all over the country are now being dispersed by the police with very little trouble and this is having a good effect.All the papers are greatly disturbed by tho alleged policereprisals and for propaganda purposes are trying to make the most of alleged torture of Irish prisoners by British military officers.There is no change in the railway situation but the &quot;Watchword of Labour&quot; is anxiously considering the possibility that the Irish railways might be closed down and urges its readers to adopt siege measures.
