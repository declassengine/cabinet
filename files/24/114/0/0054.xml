&quot;I 1 Q i 11 OCirculated by the Secretary of State for India. SECKET.perty ;^F/f^M)        From High Commissioner, Baghdad. 2Qth October 1920. 4814\*\ (Received 28th, 10 a.m.):J 4   Briority A. ,^(Ii;)   12986.  I submit progress report as follows : After seeing notables at Basrah, I visited Nasiriyah and then proceeded by river from Basrah to Baghdad halting at Qurnah, Qalat Salih, Amara and Kut. At these centres all important Sheikhs and leaders of opinion were assembled to meet me and both publicly in Durbar and privately in conversation with each important individual, I explained policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government and my mission. Adding that, while I was anxious to hear what they had to say, I did not propose to come to definite conclusions until I had visited Mosul and settled down at Baghdad; since reaching Baghdad I have paid a visit to Mosul. In Basrah Vilayet I found no enthusiasm for idea of a national Government. The merchants and people of Basrah itself have grown rich, their trade is prospering they fully appreciate the advantages of British administration and have no actual desire for a material change. In Qurna, Qalat Salih and Amara division itself, the Sheikhs and -landowners though obliged to pay revenue regularly, do so willingly now that they are secure in their tenure and immune from the necessity of periodically bribing (? any more) officials. They contemplate with some dismay the prospect of Arab government, and urge that it would be a betrayal on our part if, after rescuing them from the Turk, we were to . deliver them to uncontrolled mercy of the Arab rule. They were reassured, however, that Arab officials, when they came, would work under proper safeguards and British supervision. Ali seemed unanimous in opinion that, if a national government had to come, it must be a monarchy under our effective supervision.In Baghdad and Mosul Vilayets, the type and temper of people are different. They are not to the same degree immersed in commerce, and they are in closer touch with the West. The practical benefits of British administration are less apparent to them, and its disadvantages more pressing. Among them there is a very general and impatient desire for a greater share in the administration and early establishment of a national government. The majority of intelligentia are no doubt strong nationalists, but realising that they cannot walk alone, are inclined to trust in our assurances and look forward to gradual formation of a national administration under our auspices. In the minority is the extreme element composed of a few older (? firebrands) and a number of ambitious and visionary young men who believe that, if we were not here, they could run the administration and have the plums for themselves. A few weeks ago they were convinced that, if they made a vigorous and immediate effort, they could get rid of us and our mandate, and having done so enlist foreign experts at their pleasure. They have in great measure been disabused of these illusions, partly by our vigorous repressive measures, and partly by recent benevolent announcements by His Majesty&apos;s Government, which have taken the wind out of their sails.To be continued in my next following telegram.(P 7809) From High Commissioner, Baghdad, 2Qth October 1920. 4815(Repeated Simla.) (Received 28th, 10 a.m.) (R.)  Simal.   12987.   The actual political position is now as follows : If rebellion has not entirely subsided it no longer gives cause for serious anxiety and it only remains to clear up debris in certain localities. Meanwhile, in connection with my coming (? the) general public are expectant of some immediate step in direction of (? national) Government which will finally demonstrate bona fides of our intentions. It is clear that question of precise form of future government and type of ruler to be selected can properly be decided only by a representative congress of all the communities and sections of the people. In this connection a (? committee) of about 30 ex-deputies have been occupied for last few weeks in framing an election law for this particular Cougress. The draft will be complete in a week or so, but at 2634     100  11.20
least three and probably more months must elapse before elections can be completed, and a decision reached on above fundamental issues. Meanwhile, it does not seehi to me advisable or possible that I can (? wait). On the one hand, if no action is taken, public opinion, which is now mainly friendly, will become disappointed and distrustful. Likewise from our own point of view it is (? necessary) that national Government of some form should get to work without delay to raise (?local troops) with a view gradually to relieving our (? troops). Number of (? urgent) questions are now arising which concern future of Iraq, and which I do not feel justified in deciding without consulting a representative body of the people of the country. I . have, therefore, taken following action : j In order to form a provisional Government I have invited His, Highness the Naqib of Baghdad, whose public prestige and the respect with which he is generally held make him eminently suited for position, to form and become president of ia-Council.of State for conduct of administration under my control until such time - as National Assembly meets and decides upon future Government. For the present purposes it is essential to make it representative of all vilayets and (? Yais). It will, therefore, consist of 17 or 18 members. Of these, eight will be given portfolios and work of the existing departments under advice of present secretaries and subject to my supreme control. In order that it may have a national and not British facade, it it has appeared to me important that invitation to members and (? distribution of) duties should emanate from Naqib and not from myself, and this has been done, but each item was suggested or approved by myself.The distribution is as follows :  . ...   .(1) President of the Council aocl Reconstruction, the Naqib. (2) Interior, Said Talib Pasha of Basrah. 1(3) Finance, Sassoon Fjffendi Haskail (held office in Ottoman Government before War).(4) Justice, Hassan Pachachi (leading lawyer, Baghdad). (5) Auqaf, Mustafa (Al)us i (formerly Qazi of Mecca). (6) Education, Izzat Pasha of Kirkuk.(7) Defence, i.e., levies, gendarmerie, &amp;c, Jaafar Pasha (Major-General inFaisaFs Army). (8) Public Works, Mohammed Fadhli, Mayor of Mosul. (9) Commerce, Abdul Latif Pasha Mandil (leading merchant of Basrah).The remaining nine include a leading Christian from Baghdad and one from Mosul, a prominent Kurd of Sulaimanyah, the head of leading Shiah family, Baghdad, and two of most influential Sheikhs among settled Shiah tribes.It has not been possible to consult you in advance, as it was important to act at once at psychological moment, i.e., when I had made sure of co-operation of the Naqib.The advantage of using Naqib was that it enabled me to include Said Talib Pasha without making him President, a course which would have excited opposition in certain directions.Please publish such portions of above as you think fit.(P 7859) From Viceroy, Foreign and Political Department, 48822Sth October. 1.920. , ,(Repeated to Baghdad.)(Received 29th, 12 noon.)Priority A.1252 S. Cox&apos;s telegrams Nos. 12987 and 13038 of 26th October and 27th October. Mesopotamia. In view of profound veneration in which shrine of Abdul Kadir Ghilan I, of which Naqib is hereditary guardian, is held throughout. Indian North-West Frontier and in Afghanistan, we anticipate that appointment of Naqib to headship of provisional Government will have happiest effect, and we hope we may be. authorised to publish news without delay. We would suggest, however, that -instead, of announcement that Provisional Council of State will conduct administration &quot; under control &quot; of High Commissioner, phrase used should be &quot; subject to advice of High Commissioner.&quot;   This will, we think, have better effect on public opinion.
(P 7886)      From High Commissioner, Mesopotamia, 2(Mli October .1920. 4916(Repeated to India.) (Received 30th, 4.30 p.m.)Clear the line.13146. Simal. Reference Government of India&apos;? telegram No. 1252, dated 28th October. In view of fact that pending creation of National Government in final form pursuant to decision of Majlis all responsibility for conduct of administration rests with the High Commissioner, formula suggested by the Government of India. would I fear be a terminological inexactitude. We might perhaps avoid use of word &quot;control&quot; by saying &quot;will conduct administration in association with the High Commissioner.&quot;
