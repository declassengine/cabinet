931/279/98) .Memo ran duiy, by f&amp;Qjj?^^  -L0Hz 0 ,-&quot;foe econcmi c weapon by the league?The economic weapon of the League is provided for by Article 16 of the covenant - paragraph 3 - in whioh the members rf the League agree that they will mutually support one another in the eocnomio and financial measures contemplated in the article in ofder to sever all trade and financial relations,, and prohibit all intercourse, personal, financial or commercial between their nationals and nationals of the State whioh has violated the Covenant by resorting to War.   The council decided at its meeting, at gan Sebastian in August 1920, to propose to the Assembly-the appointment of an international Blockade Commission to study the problem.   To this there seems no objection.The Foreign office has been in communication with the Board of Trade as to the powers actually existing in this country to give efj.ect &quot;to Article 16 of the Covenant and as there is some doubt on the point the Lav. rf fleers are being asked (l)   Whether the Treaty of peaos Act enables His Majesty&apos;s Government to. impose by orders in council all measures neoessary for carrying into effect the economic blockade, and (2)   Whether His Majesty&apos;s Government become automatically at war with a covenant-breaking State, in the event of the oiroum-stances contemplated by Article 16 of the Covenant arising.On the answer cf the Lav.; officers depends the question whether parliamentary authority will have to be obtained before His Majesty&apos;s Government can commit themselves to enforce a oomplete blockade on a covenant-breaking state.   (Although it is more than doubtful whether parliament in passing the Treaty of peace Act, realised the possibility of its application to article 16
Article IB cf the covenant.) The o zeroise of any power a which His Majesty&apos;s Government may possess will require careful con-si deration in eaoh case fro./.the political point of view.Wo action presumably by the representatives of His Majesty&apos; Government at the Assembly will he required heyend agreeing to the appointment cf an international C-mniscion to study the question,    subject to any views whicli the Board of Trade may express, no objection is seen to this course.&apos; It is however important that the selection of the British Representatives on &quot; that international commission should have the approval ^f His Maj treaty Vs government.reign office, g .1&apos;r. 1 * October 25th, 192Q.
