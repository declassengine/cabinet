Circulated by the Secretary of State for India, &apos; /SEGBE)T.^./J;*egret that I am obliged to ask that my dissent may be recorded from the 7 conclusions of the Conference of Ministers held on the 18th October, at which general approval was given to the revised draft mandate for Mesopotamia. I appreciate the action of my colleagues in approving the proposal I made in my note of the 9th. October, that in the first instance Sir Percy Cox should be asked for his report on the draft. But I still feel strongly the force of the other considerations which I put forward in that note. It has always been my hope that in our dealings with Mesopotamia, we should keep steadily in the foreground two main successive objects: first to set up an Arab Government, taking such steps as might be necessary to prevent foreign interference; and, that accomplished, to leave the country. Now the draft mandate, however great its merits to which I am fully alive as a careful and comprehensive piece of work, certainly does not and possibly could not give to those two objects the prominence which each of them, and particularly the second, requires. On the contrary, it tends to obscure them, and it may be even to frustrate them. It sets before us grave liabilities which are easy to undertake but may be almost impossible to terminate. I am more than doubtful how long public opinion in this country, in its present temper, is likely to tolerate such liabilities when they are made known in the form in which the mandate defines them. But there is an even more serious aspect to which I must once again draw my colleagues&apos; attention. As the events of the last four months have shown, our liabilities as now prescribed may only too easily require military force for their discharge. Hitherto we have looked to India for that force, because there is nowhere else to look. I must once more repeat the warning that the continued use of Indian troops in Mesopotamia, under conditions that promise no immediate termination, will be a source of danger in India beside which the convenience of a carefully-framed and exhaustive mandate is insignificant.1        &apos;1 E.
