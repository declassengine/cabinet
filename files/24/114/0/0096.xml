In a memorandum circulated by Sir James Stevenson, he pointsout that the present, establishment of Woolwich is 13,800 employees, arid that it is proposed tt re duo e the number to 11,500.The cost of maintaining Woolvdch, Bnfield and rialtham Abbey on their reduced establishments will amount in the financial year ending March 31st 1922 to 6-j- millions, leaving orders for 4rf millions to be secured to maintain the reduced establishments.Already unemployment amongst ex-Woolwich workers is severe, and the greatest difficulty will be found in reducing the establishment by 1,700 more employees.Sir Janes Stevenson recommends that the factories should be equipped for peace products by the installation of the necessary plant.     Ho states that the plant could, he thinks, bo supplied without a call upon the Treasury by selling certain current stocks.   He further advises that orders should be taken from the trade for peace-time products, or failing such orders that the factories should be allowed to enter into competition with the trado.
The Cabinet decision cf the 19th May only authorises the factories to -act as sub-contractors.It Is submitted that no true distinction can be drawn between acting as sub-contractors and acting as contractors.The factories could make locomotives, wagons, and cranes and could provide for their repair.    They could also undertake the repair of motor lorries.Sir James Stevenson reports also that there are great possibilities for the extended manufacture in this country of electrical equipment, Including turbo-generators, electric motors and electric locomotives, and also of electrical domestic appliances for heating, cooking, washing, cleaning etc, which are apparently not made in this country at present.The exceptional features which might justify State trading appear to be -(1)     The absence of housing facilities elsewhere prevents the migration of the skilled men and deprives them of the power of seeking employment with private firms elsewhere,(2)     As regards certain electrical equipment, there is at present no home manufacture,(3)     The maintenance of a nucleus staff at the Arsenal is necessary as a war insurance.   Kept idle, the staff will cost 4f millions j employed, even though the produces, are not made at competitive prices, some return will be received *(4)     Certain classes of peace products could he made on direct Government orders for Government use, A decision is required on the use to which these National Factories may be put*(Intd,)2, Whitehall Gardens.
