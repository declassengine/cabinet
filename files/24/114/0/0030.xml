PART I-THE LABOUR SITUATION.THE GENERAL SITUATION.General Survey of the Week.Formal negotiations between the Government and the miners were re-opened on the 24th October, in a conference between the Prime Minister, with other representatives of the Government, and the president of the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain, Mr. Smillie, the vice-president, Mr. Smith, the treasurer, Mr. Robson, and the secretary, Mr. Hodges, Direct conferences with the full executive of  he Federation commenced on the 26th October but had not resulted in an agreement by the 27th.* The decision of the Miners&apos; Federation, on the 23rd September, that, in the event of a strike, such work should be allowed as was necessary for maintaining the mines in condition has been generally observed, though in a few places difficulties have arisen. The delegate conference of the South Wales Miners&apos; Federation, however, and the Council of the National Union of Scot-tish Mine Workers have each adopted a resolution limiting the period of the operation of this arrangement, fWith regard to the policy of the other national bodies of organised labour towards the dispute, the two events of importance during the week have been the threatened strike of members of the National Union of Railwaymen, and the special conference, of - the executives of trade unions affiliated to the Trades Union Congress, which was held on the 27th October. It seems to be generally recognised that the resolution of the special general meeting of the National Union of Railwaymen was taken hastily, and without due consideration of the circumstances which would result from a strike. From the trade union point of view the immediate effect would have been to make impossible the holding of any special conference, representative of the whole trade union movement at which concerted action might have been taken. Resolutions have been reported from two branches of the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen, showing that the neglect of Mr. Bromley&apos;s union in this matter by the National Union of Railwaymen has given rise to a certain amount of ill-feeling between the members of the two bodies. With reference to the special trades union conference, it should be observed that the meeting is not formally a meeting of the Trades Union Congress. It is a meeting repre-sentative of the executive bodies of the various trade unions and, as such, has more authority over the membership of the various trade unions than attaches to an ordinary meeting of the Trades Union Congress. In its constitution it follows the precedent set by the con-ference which instituted the Council of Action on the 13th August. It is, however, dis-distinguished from that meeting by the fact that it contains no representatives of the political side of the Labour movement as such.There is nothing of exceptional interest in the attitude of the various ex-Service men&apos;s associations towards the strike. The Federation of Discharged and Demobilised Sailors and Soldiers have announced that their policy is one of strict neutrality and non-interference in industrial disputes. The Comrades of. the Great War have issued a state-ment enunciating a similar principle, but going on to point out the need for maintaining certain essential services for the community.An interesting feature of the situation, however, has been the securing of statements of policy from representatives of foreign and international trade union bodies. The Executive Committee of the International Federation of Transport Workers are reported to have instructed their secretary to consult the transport workers&apos; organisations of Great Britain, France, Germany, Belgium and Holland, on the question of giving international support to the Miners&apos; Federation. It has been reported that certain American unions propose to hamper the export of any additional coal supplies from the United States; and a statement has been circulated by the president of the German miners&apos; organisation that his members would see that no coal delivered by Germany under the Spa agreement should be used to break the miners&apos; strike.* On the 28th October, the negotiations between the Government and the executive of the Miners&apos; Federation concluded in a provisional agreement, which will be submitted to a ballot vote of the members of the Federation.f For the actual negotiations between the miners and the Government, see Strikes and Lock-outs, p. 509. The general effect of the coal strike on the unemployment position is briefly dealt with on p. 503. $ The attitude of the other national bodies of organised labour towards the dispute is dealt with under General Topics, p. 504. The detailed effects of the coal strike will be shown in the weekly report on the work of the Employ-ment and Insurance Department, in due course, in Part II. -
The General Situation-continued.The general problem of unemployment, with particular reference to ex-Service men,, is a matter of interest second only in importance to the coal strike. The Prime Ministers statement in the House of Commons on the 19th October, outlining the policy of the Government, has excited wide attention; and the whole unemployment position was debated in the House of Commons on the 21st October. Mr. Chadwick, of the National Union of Foundry Workers, has protested against any exceptional admission of unemployed ex-Service men to the foundry trades. The National Federation of Building Trades Operatives met in Manchester on the 26th to discuss the proposed national agreement, drawn up by the Resettlement Committee of the Industrial Council for the Building Industry, for increasing the supply of labour available for housing schemes; but they devoted them-selves chiefly to a consideration of a communication from the Minister of Health, outlining the additional proposals of the Government for the employment of ex-Service men in the building trades. A decision on the proposed national agreement was apparently postponed. The coming into operation of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920, is now exciting considerable attention.Negotiations have been continued during the week between the employers and men in the engineering and shipbuilding industries. The assistance of the Chief Labour Adviser has been sought by the unions concerned in the negotiations in the textile bleaching, dyeing and finishing trades. The interest in the road transport dispute has now been transferred to the various districts. Strikes have already occurred in Carlisle, Bradford, Leeds and some other towns in the West Riding. Where they have occurred their local effect is said to be more serious than that of the coal strike.An Emergency Powers Bill was introduced into the House of Commons by the Secretary of State for Home Affairs on the 22nd October, and received its second reading on the 25th. It was read a third time and passed the House of Commons on the 27th. The Bill has been strenuously opposed by Labour members, and the text of the resolution respecting it, adopted by the special trade union conference on the 27th, is given below.The Unemployment Position.The Coal Strike and Unemployment-Returns collected through the Employment Exchange organisation show that, in England and Wales, on the 8th October, 244,729 out-of-work donation policies and unemployment books were lodged at the Exchanges. On the 25th October the total was 372,926; and on the 26th October, 386,180. The increase is most marked in the Northern, Wales and Yorkshire and East Midlands Divisions, where the total on the 8th October was more than doubled on the 26th. The total in Scotland stood at 19,656 on the 8th October, and at 30,166 on the 26th. In Ireland the most serious effect has been apparent in the curtailment of the steamer and rail services, 50 trains having been discontinued on the Great Southern and Western Railway alone. It is reported that no coal will be sent to Ireland until the miners resume work and only the reserves actually held in the country will be available.- Returns, classified by industry, for the 26th October show that, so far as reported, 81,955 discharges were due to the entire closure of works and 128,443 to reduction in staff, giving a total of 210,398. In addition 250,868 workers had been placed on short time. The industries mainly affected were iron and steel manufacture, which, accounted for 117,626 discharges, the textile industry, which accounted for nearly 30,438 discharges and more than half, of the short-time working, and the shipbuilding and engineering industries, with 34,909 workers discharged.Other Statistics. The number of H.M. Forces and merchant seamen out-of-work donation policies current, for the United Kingdom, for the week ending the 15th October was 172,834, made up of 172,328 lodged by men and 506 by women. On the 8th October there were 168,824 policies current, 168,282 for men and 542 for women.On the 15th October, 120,184 unemployment books, 81,915 for males and 38,269 for females, remained lodged by workers under the Unemployment Insurance Acts. Corn-pared with, the previous week, when there were 82,211 books lodged by males and 37,258 by females, the total increase is 715.The total on the live registers of all Employment Exchanges on the 15th October and a detailed analysis of the unemployment position at that date will be found, on page 518.(b 16575)3T2503 - 30.10.20.
FEATURES OF THE WEEK.General Topics.Coal Strike : Sympathetic Action. The question of sympathetic strike action in support of the coal miners has been mentioned during the week, particularly in the case of the railwaymen. The General Meeting of the National Union of Railwaymen considered the situation on the 20th and 21st October, and on the latter day passed a resolution by 33 votes to 24 in favour of a sympathetic strike, to take place at midnight on the 24th, should a settlement of the dispute not have been arrived at by that time, or should nego-tiations not have been resumed between the miners and the Governments The Prime Minister, however, on the 23rd, invited the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain to depute representatives to meet him during the week-end. At a joint conference between the General Meeting of the National Union of Railwaymen and the National Executive of the Miners&apos; Federation later in the day, the miners requested the railwaymen temporarily to suspend sympathetic strike action. This suggestion was adopted by the General Meeting and the threat of an immediate railway strike was thus removed.The situation has also been closely followed by the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen, and by the Council of the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation. The former society, however, had not been officially informed of the intention of the National Union of Railwaymen to call a special General Meeting to decide upon the policy of that union, and, in consequence, their executive were not in a position to declare their policy until branch meetings, on the 24th October, had instructed the Executive Council, who decided their policy on the 26th. The Council of the National Transport Workers&apos; Federa-tion cannot, on their own initiative, call a strike; and their meetings during the week have not resulted in any ultimatum, comparable to that of the National Union of Railwaymen. .The Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress appear to have con-sidered the position on the 21st October, and it was announced on the 22nd that they had decided to summon a special conference of the executives, or representatives of the exe-cutives, of affiliated trade unions for the 27th, to consider the best means of giving such help to the miners as would ensure success in their efforts for a settlement. The state-ment of the 22nd also affirmed that the question of trade union policy to be pursued was of such importance that it should be dealt with by the whole of the movement, and ex-pressed the desire of the Parliamentary Committee that no action should be taken by separate bodies which might result in the absence of unity in the efforts to ensure a settle-ment. This position has been endorsed by the executives of the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen, the Railway Clerks&apos; Association and the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation. After the decision of the railwaymen to suspend their strike, the policy of the Parliamentary Committee held the field.The meeting of the executives of the unions affiliated to the Trades Union Congress was duly held on the 27th, but-a series of adjournments took place because of the active negotiations that day between the miners and the Government. The conference, however, passed a resolution protesting against the Emergency Powers Bill, in the following terms : &quot; This Congress, representing the organised Labour movement of the country, condemns the action of the Government in forcing through Parliament the Emergency Powers Bill, which, in our opinion, strikes at the existence of the trade union movement.We hereby enter our emphatic protest.against the Government^ action, and instruct the Par-liamentary Committee, in conjunction with the Labour Party Executive and the Parliamentary Labour Party, to immediately consider the whole matter in order that a special conference may be called, if necessary, to deal further with the subject.&quot;The conference will resume their sessions on the 28th October.Labour and Ireland. It is reported that the situation in Belfast remains unchanged. The members of the local branch of the Amalgamated Society of Carpenters, Cabinet Makers and Joiners who failed to obey the order of the Executive Committee to cease work for those firms whose employees were being dismissed on religious and political grounds have been automatically expelled from the society, and have formed a provisional com-mittee. During the week this body issued circulars advising the expelled members to hold their meetings as usual and to collect contributions and pay out benefits pending* The text of this resolution was given in this Report last week, p. 478.
the decision of the General Council. A statement in defence of their position has been drawn up by the committee, who contend, among other things, that the executive committee were not properly informed of the situation, and that the methods adopted by them were illegal.The railway situation remains much the same. Further cases have occurred in which, owing to the attempt of soldiers or armed police to board trains, officials on the railways have refused duty. Some of these men have been suspended, and others dis-missed. It is stated that several trains were discontinued during the week owing, to the depletion of staff. *Unemployment Insurance Ad, 1920. The special committee appointed in the boot and shoe industry, to inquire into the working of the Act so far as it affects the industry, have drafted a special scheme which is to be submitted to members of the Boot and Shoe Manufacturers&apos; Federation, and of the National Union of Boot and Shoe Operatives. If adopted it will be presented to the Ministry for approval.A special meeting of the Scottish Conference of Friendly and Approved Societies was held on the 16th October to discuss the proposal that approved societies should assist in the administration of the Act. A suggestion that all approved societies in Scotland should join the newly formed National Association for Unemployment Insurance was referred to the executive after discussion.Several branches of the National Union of Agricultural Workers having recently passed resolutions demanding that agricultural workers shall be brought within the scope of the Act, Mr. George Dallas brought a motion to this effect before a meeting of the Agricultural Wages Board, on the 21st October. The proposal gave rise to much discussion, and was eventually deferred to the next meeting of the Board, on the 2nd December.The question of unemployment insurance was discussed at a meeting of the National Council of the National Union of Ships&apos; Stewards, Cooks, Butchers and Bakers on the 22nd October. It was decided that the union should adopt a scheme to enable them to pay unemployment insurance benefit to their members.. Wages (Temporary Regulation) Acts, 1918-19. Arising out of the deputation repre-senting the National Federation of Women Workers and other trade unions which, waited on the Minister on the 5th October to place before him their views on the effect of the expiry of these Acts on the position of women workers,f and to urge their renewal, the Minister received on the .19th October a further deputation representing employers&apos; organisations. They informed the Minister that they were strongly opposed to any revival of the Acts, on the ground that the time had been reached when Government intervention in, and regulation of, industrial matters was no longer of advantage to the community, but they were quite prepared to meet the union representatives concerned and discuss the matter.Relief of Unemployment (London). The Parliamentary Committee of the Trades *Union Congress, on the 20th October, discussed the unemployment situation. It was recommended that a scheme of maintenance, should be introduced by the Government to supplement the Unemployment Insurance Act, the suggestion being that the out-of-work donation should be temporarily revived.The proposals of the Government for the alleviation of unemployment, as outlined by the Prime Minister to the deputation of London mayors on the 18th October, were further discussed at a conference on the 22nd October between representatives of the London County Council and the mayors of several Metropolitan boroughs. General Sir H. Maybury, of the Ministry of Transport, explained the road construction scheme which forms part of the Government proposals. It was criticised&apos; by several of the Labour mayors mainly on the ground that a very considerable proportion of the work which it is to provide will be outside the area of the Metropolitan boroughs.The special Committee on Unemployment set up by the London County Council have recommended the Council to accept the Government^ proposal that the Council should be responsible for the performance of work on the roads which come within the jurisdiction of the Council, and the Council have decided to do this.Engineering Industry. The Engineering and the National Employers&apos; Federations have undertaken to carry on the work of the Engineering Training Organisation, which has been an independent body since its formation in 1917.  The executive of the organisation* See also p* 503 above under The Goal Strike and Unemployment. f See this Report, Vol. II, No. 15, 9th October, p. 431.
recently decided that jit[was no longer possible to continue as an independent body owing to the lack of support from the leading engineering manufacturers^Board of Education: Salaries of Secondary School Teachers. The Standing Joint Committee appointed last May under the chairmanship of Viscount Burnham have put forward a revised scale of salaries for teachers in secondary schools.It will be recalled that the bodies represented on the committee are, on the one side, the County Councils Association, the Municipal Corporations Association, the Associa-tion of Education Committees and the London County Council, and, on the other, the Incorporated Associations of Head Masters, of Head Mistresses and of Assistant Masters in Secondary Schools, the Association of Assistant Mistresses in Public Secondary Schools, and the National Union of Teachers. The proposals just formulated represent a consider-able advance in the pay and prospects of teachers; the arrangements for the &quot; carry-over &quot; to the new scales, and the general conditions governing their application, follow the lines suggested in the case of elementary school teadiers.fHours of Nurses. About a month ago there was a considerable agitation in the Press in favour of a reduction in the working hours of nurses, who are endeavouring through an association known as the Professional Union of Trained Nurses, and by general propaganda, to secure such a reduction without having recourse to a threat to take corporate action to enforce their demands, a proceeding which is considered undesirable owing to the nature of their profession. Within the last few days a meeting of the General Nursing Council has been held to consider the desirability of bringing nurses within the scope of the 48-hour week provisions of the proposed Hours of Employment (No. 2) Bill. The result of the vote taken at the meeting was against this proposal, 13 voting against and 10 in favour. Among the minority were four of the representatives of the nurses. The Council, which was appointed under the Nurses Registration Act, 1919, consists of 25 members, appointed severally by the Privy Council (2); the Board of Education (2); and the Minister of Health (21), 16 of whom shall be persons &quot; who are or have at some time been nurses actually engaged in rendering services in direct connection with the nursing of the sick.&quot;Industrial and Other Organisations.National Federation of Building Trades Operatives. A special conference of the execu-tives of the trade unions affiliated to the Federation was held in Manchester on the 26th October, to consider what attitude should be adopted by the unions towards the proposed national agreement for the augmentation of skilled labour employed on housing schemes, and for securing increased output on those schemes. The conference was enabled to discuss the additional proposals of the Government for providing work for unemployed ex-Service men in large numbers upon housing schemes, which were communicated in a statement from the Minister of Health.The statement was based on the following premises: there were at the moment 180,000 ex-Service men unemployed, mostly young and unskilled; the financial con-ditions of the country were such that the continuance of out-of-work donation for a day * longer than could be avoided was wrong, and the donation was of no permanent benefit to the men. The action which the Government were taking, therefore, was to examine carefully those trades which could absorb more men, one of which was the building trade. The published figures proved that there was room for augmentation in the trade, and the trade had to bear what was essentially a war task, namely, the making good quickly of the enormous shortage of houses due to the war. The exact proposal of the Govern-ment was that they should select certain housing schemes now held up for lack of labour, and set them aside to be carried through by ex-Service men, who would be trained as the work went on, receiving rates of pay based on district rates, and rising to full rates as the men qualified by their work. These schemes would be earmarked as ex-Service men&apos;s schemes, and would be restricted to ex-Service men, apart from those who assisted in pro-viding instruction and oversight. The Government would ask the building trade unions to help, especially by encouraging trade unionists to undertake the training of the ex-Service men. The Government thought that 50,000 men should be taken on for training, in su table- proportions in the various skilled trades. These proposals were supplementary to, and not in replacement of, the proposals recently agreed upon with the Building Resettlement Committee of the Joint Industrial Council. It was suggested that the aug-mentation in &quot;abour provided under the two schemes should be taken together in respect of the numbers submitted to the unions in these proposals.* See this Keport, Vol. II, No. 12,18th September, p. 360. t See this Eeport, Vol. II, No. 17, 23rd October, p. 482.
The discussion at the conference was conducted in private, and a resolution was adopted stating that the proposals must necessarily mean intensified insecurity in an industry &quot; which had been,jin thejpast, chief amongst the casual trades.&quot; The Government pro-posals, in the^view of the Federation, meant wholesale dilution, and the suspension of all their working rules &quot; which it had taken them years of effort, pain and destitution to build up.&quot; The resolution concluded with a request that the Government should give an im-mediate reply stating in clear termsjwhat guarantees they could offer in return for the suspension of these rules, before the Federation could give further consideration to the proposals.Building Guilds. A proposal to carry out a housing scheme by direct labour, obtained through a building guild, has been, brought before the Housing Committee of the Glasgow Corporation. It was agreed to recommend that such an arrangement should be tried, the guild supplying all the labour required for the operations, and the Corporation furnishing bhe necessary plant and material.At Newport the Corporation have refused the tender of the Newport Building Guild ; the Newport Trades and Labour Council have accordingly decided to ask the Ministry of Health to make an official inquiry into the matter.Trade Union Topics.Cleveland and Durham Blastfurnacemen and Cokemerts Association. The ballot on the question of forming one union for the blastfurnacemen and kindred workers in England and Whales, taken recently, has resulted in a large majority in favour of the scheme. The unions affected are the Cleveland and Durham Blastfurnacemen and Cokemen&apos;s Associa-tion; the Eastern Midland District of the National Federation of Blastfurnacemen; the Cumberland arid Lancashire District of the National Federation of Blastfurnacemen; the Midland Association of Blastfurnacemen, Cokemen and By-Product Workers ; and the - South Wales and Monmouthshire District of the National Federation of Blastfurnacemen. It is stated that, excluding four or five plants in Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire, all the workmen employed at blast furnace plants will be covered by the new union. The Con-ciliation Board and sliding scale machinery at present in operation in the various districts will be continued under the new scheme.Ex-Service Men.Employment of Ex-Service Men. A scheme has been prepared by the Brighton War Pensions Committee for the establishment of a factory to employ disabled ex-Service men who are not able to do a full day&apos;s work. It is suggested that a sum could be raised which might be invested in Corporation or Government securities, the interest being applied to carrying on the work. It is claimed that, under the scheme, the men could add to their pensions according to their capacity for work. The Town Council have appointed a special committee to consider the scheme.Amalgamation of Ex-Service Men&apos;s Organisations. Amalgamation with other organisa-tions of ex-Service men was discussed at a meeting of the West Riding Divisional Council of the Comrades of the Great War on the 23rd October. -Delegates from about forty branches were present.   The motion in favour of amalgamation was carried by 35 votes to 3.National Union of Ex-Service Men.-At a conference of the union held at Swansea during the week, a resolution was carried declaring their solidarity with the miners and pledging themselves to do all in their power to aid them.International Relations of Labour.International Federation of Trade Unions. It is announced that the Council of this federation have decided to appoint a commission, consisting of MM. Jouhaux (France), Fimmen (Holland), and Mertens (Belgium), with a representative of the British trade union movement, not yet appointed, to consider the proposal for the occupation by the Allies, in certain circumstances, of the Ruhr coal district.
NEGOTIATIONS AND DISPUTES.Demands and Negotiations.Building Trades Operatives (Scotland).-k joint meeting of the Scottish National Build-ing Trades Federation (Employers) and the Scottish Building Contractors&apos; Association will consider the wages claim of the Building Trades of Scotland Operatives&apos; Wages and Conditions of Service Board on the 28th October.*Shipbuilders and Engineers (National).-Qn the 22nd October, representatives of the shipyard trades conferred with shipbuilding employers over the national wages claim.f The conference was adjourned by agreement for three weeks, in order that each side might investigate the position further. Discussions between the Amalgamated Engineering Union and the Engineering and the National Employers&apos; Federations were resumed on the 27th October.Commercial Road Transport Workers-The possibility of local negotiations is being explored in Cardiff, Swansea, Huddersfield, Manchester, Liverpool, Nottingham, Northamp-ton and Bristol, and jointly by Staffordshire, Worcestershire, Warwickshire, Shropshire and Herefordshire. Notices have been handed in by the men at Liverpool and Bristol. For a report on the strike in progress in Yorkshire and elsewhere, see p. 509 below.Railway Shopmen (National). The Minister of Transport held a joint conference with representatives of the shopmen grades of the National Union of Railwaymen, and of the craft unions, on the 21st October, with reference to the new wages claim of the workers employed in railway shops. The proposal of the National Union of Railwaymen included the consolidation of all war advances, and the establishment of a new standard minimum of  6 a week for skilled workers. The craft unions pressed for the adoption in railway shops of district engineering rates.Shop Assistants (London). With reference to the demandj of the National Amalgamated Union of Shop Assistants, Warehousemen and Clerks for a 25 per cent, increase on present wages for London shop assistants, a mass meeting of members affected, at the Albert Hall on the 22nd October, decided to make one more appeal to the employers to agree either to arbitration, or to the intervention in some other way of the Ministry of Labour and, in the event of this appeal being rejected, to give their shop stewards power to ballot the members.  The union are now in touch with the Ministry.Warehouse Workers (London).-Th.e claim made by the National Warehouse and General Workers&apos; Union on behalf of warehouse workers in the City of London, for an advance of  l per week and an increase on overtime rates, was the subject of a conference between representatives of the union and the Labour Council of the Wholesale Textile Association on the 26th October. It is understood that the employers made no offer, but pleaded a considerable depression in trade. The union are placing the whole position before their members at a special meeting within the next few days.Insurance Officials.&apos; The ballot taken by the Guild of Insurance Officials on with-drawing members from the employment of the General Accident, Fire and Life Insurance Corporation, Ltd.,inconsequence of a victimisation dispute, has resulted in more than the necessary majority in favour. The guild have appealed to the shareholders to appoint a &apos; committee of investigation. A national delegate conference will be held on the 7th Novem-ber, to arrange for a compulsoryjlevy on all members for the support of the clerks withdrawn, who will be paid at the rate of their ordinary salaries.Strikes and Lock-Outs.Building Trades Operatives (Midlands and Yorkshire). In consequence of the recent falure in several cases of building trades operatives in the Midland and Yorkshire areas* See this Eeport, Vol. II, No. 17, 23rd October, p. 485. f See this Keport, Vol. II, No. 16,16th October, p. 458. J See this Eeport, Vol. II, No. 15, 9th October, p. 437.
Negotiations and Disputes-continued.to &quot;accept awards by Conciliation&quot;1 Boards, and the continuance of unofficial strikes, the National Conciliation Board on the 11th and 12th October refused to deal with cases on the agenda from the areas in question until the existing disputes had been satisfactorily settled. They appointed a joint deputation to visit the affected districts with a view to a settlement. The two main cases which have occurred are at Rugby and Leeds. Operatives at Rugby, after an application for upgrading the district from B to A had been refused by the Conciliation Board, left the district in large numbers to find work in Grade A districts. The local branch of the National Federation of Building Trades Operatives contended that their members were at liberty to work in any district they might choose, and that their action in leaving Rugby did not constitute a strike. The National Federation of Building Trades Employers and the executive of the National Federation of Building Trades Opera-tives held the opposite view, the latter declaring the strike unconstitutional. At Leeds a number of bricklayers struck over a dispute as to whether unskilled labour should be employed on the construction of concrete houses. The Northern Demarcation Com-mittee decided that the work in question was unskilled, and the Operative Bricklayers&apos; Society ordered the men to resume. These instructions, however, have not been complied with.Goal Miners (National). Informal discussions which began on the 21st October between the Prime Minister, the Lord Privy Seal and the President cf the Board of Trade, on the one hand, and certain miners&apos; representatives, on the other, continued on the 22nd. On the 23rd, the Executive Committee of the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain were summoned to London, whereupon the Prime Minister officially invited conversations with a view to finding a new basis for negotiation. The executive deputed Messrs. R. Smillie, F. Hodges, H. Smith and J. Robson, to confer with the Prime Minister. Conversations were continued over the week-end, and, on the 25th, were advanced to a point at which the Governments new suggestions were put in the form of definite proposals for the consideration of the miners&apos; executive. Up to the 27th, the only further development had been the re-establishment of definite - negotiations between the whole body of the Executive of the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain and the representatives of the Government.The delegate conference of the South Wales Miners&apos; Federation at Cardiff, on the 22nd October agreed to the following recommendation : &quot; That representations be made to the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain to convene a national conference, to be held on the 27th October, to consider and determine a policy with reference to the withdrawal of the whole of the men from each of the collieries in Great Britain, such policy to be put into action on the 30th October should the strike not be settled before that day.&quot;Similar resolutions have been passed by the special delegate conference of the National Union of Scottish Mine Workers, by the Council of the Nottinghamshire Miners&apos; Associa-tion and by the Council of the Derbyshire Miners&apos; Association. The-Durham County Mining Federation Board have issued an appeal to the men to abide by their agreement with the owners on the matter of safety work ; and the executive committee of the North-cumberland Miners&apos; Association have been endeavouring to overrule the decision of some branches not to allow workmen down the pit during the strike. The Oldhill and District Miners&apos; Protection Society, on the 26th October, decided to prohibit the further drawing of slack for pumping operations in the local mines.Commercial Road Transport Workers. Following on the failure of a joint conference at Bradford, on the 21st October, of representatives of employers and employed in the road transport industry, the men came out on strike on the 22nd in several centres in Yorkshire. Nearly 5,000 are out in Leeds and about 3,000 in Bradford. The strike has extended to Keighley, Bingley and Skipton, and other districts are seeking permission to follow suit.  A further joint conference on the 26th also failed to effect agreement.At Bradford the strike does not affect carters in the employment of railway com-panies, who are members of the National Union of Railwaymen, or carters employed by the Bradford Dyers&apos; Association, Ltd,, who are in a separate union. A multiplicity of unions are involved, including the National Union of General Workers, the Amalgamated Associa-tion of Carters and Motormen, the United Vehicle Workers and the United Carters and Motormen&apos;s Association.

The strike of plain net workers in the Nottingham lace trade, after lasting 19 weeks, concluded on the 25th October, the men resuming on the old terms except for the substitution of a 48-hour for a 55-hour week. The employers definitely refused to pay percentage increases on piece-work prices compensatory for the reduction in hours. Time-workers, however, are to receive the full weekly rate for the reduced week.Tramwaymen (Glasgow). The threatened strike of Glasgow tramwaymen has been averted, the Corporation having granted an advance of 4s. a week which has been accepted by the unions concerned &quot; as a temporary expedient.&quot;[Other disputes, negotiations and settlements are referred to in the Industrial Relations Departments section of the Report, page-t 511 to 515.]

Members of the Shoe Rivet and Wire Nail Makers&apos; Society accepted their executive^ suggestion* that work should be resumed on the prices and. conditions in operation prior to the strike, subject to the employers agree-ing that a joint conference should be held as soon as possible after the resumption of work to discuss certain points of difference. By the 18th October the men had all returned to work.Co-operative Societies (Northern Area).--hi August, the members of the Amalgamated Union of Co-operative and Commercial Employees and Allied Workers voted in favour of a strike for a 20s. increase upon minimum wages, on account of the increase of 25 per cent, in the cost of living. After several meetings between the parties, the societies were willing to grant 50 per cent, of the employees&apos; demand, provided that any &quot; district or society &quot; claiming to be unable to pay the increase should have the right to appeal to the Joint Wages Council, who should decide thereon. The union refused to agree to this provision, and issued strike notices to expire on the 16th October. Through the Chief Conciliation Officer&apos;s intervention, a joint conference was arranged on the 13th October, when the Central Council agreed to drop the word &quot; district &quot; from their offer, and agreed that any appeal should be lodged within 14 days of signing the agreement, and should be settled within 14 days of their receipt. This led to a settlement of the dispute, and the notices were with-drawn.Co-operative Society&apos;&apos;s Employees (Peterborough). A dispute over the refusal of the society to pay the rates of wages agreed upon in July by the Co-operative Hours and Wages Board and the Amalgamated Union of Co-operative and Commercial Employees and Allied Workers, culminated in a strike on the 21st October. All the retail shops were closed, and. 400 employees were out.

J. Maude &amp; Sons, Hebden Bridge, sole manufacturers, for an advance of 2d. an hour, to operate from the 1st April. This the firm would not concede, and, on the 21st May, 60 operatives ceased work. On the 26th May, however, the firm agreed to pay the 2d. an hour advance and to give a lump sum of  .2 per man in lieu of retrospective payment.  This was accepted, and work was resumed on the* See this Eeport, Vol. II, No. 15, 9th October, p. 452.

Early in October, the union applied for a further advance of Zd. an hour on behalf of their members employed by Messrs. J. Maude &amp; Sons, and a strike was threatened. The Chief Conciliation Officer arranged a conference on the 15th October at which, a settlement was reached. The agreement reached in May was to be considered as terminating on the 28th October, and the new agreement was to operate from that date for four months. Advances of is. Gd. and 2s. 3d. per week were granted to datal workers, men and boys, respectively, and of 15 p*er cent, to piece-workers. Arrangements were also made for the decision of questions relating to age demarcation between men and boys, and to the compilation of new piece-prices.interpretations  and rulings.Effect of Termination vf Wages Act on Agreements. The Asbestos Association, Ltd., have asked the department what effect the cessation of the Wages (Temporary Regulation) Acts will have in respect of agreements as to rates of wages. As regards an agreement made before the termination of the Act and unaltered by the Joint Industrial Council, they have been informed that, while the Minister has no authority to determine the legal questions raised in their letter, he has been advised that an agreement made in accordance with the provisions of the Wages (Temporary Regulation) Act, 1918, has no statutory sanction after the 30th September, 1920. As regards agreements made by the Joint Industrial Council and approved by the Minister of Labour after the date when the Wages (Temporary Regula-tion) Act came to an end, they have been told that the power of the Minister to approve agreements for the purpose of making them statutorily enforceable, which was derived from the Wages (Temporary Regulation) Act, 1918, was withdrawn by the provisions of the Industrial Courts Act, 1919.questions pending and miscellaneous.Vehicle Building (National). A conference between representatives of the National Federation of Vehicle Trades on the one hand and the National Union of Vehicle Builders, the Amalgamated Wheelwrights, Smiths, and Kindred Trades Union and the Amalgamated society of1 Woodcutting Machinists on the other, was held at Montagu House, on the 22nd October, under the chairmanship of Mr. McKerrell. It was agreed to recommend that the federation agree to pay an advance of l\d. per hour on all existing rates, the advance to date from the resumption of work; that payment by results be instituted in all factories where the employers so desire, the details of each, system to be mutually agreed ; that the agreement be valid up to the 22nd March, 1921, and that two months&apos; notice of any pro-posed variation be given by either side; that there be no victimisation on either side ; and that, on the acceptance of these terms, work be resumed immediately.The Scottish Vehicle Builders&apos; Association informed the Chief Conciliation Officer, Glasgow, that they were unable to accept his proposal that they should meet representatives of the National Union of Vehicle Builders in conference, but that they would agree to the claim being referred to arbitration, if the men first returned to work. At a mass meeting of the workmen, the employers&apos; suggestion that the dispute should be referred for settlement by arbitration was not accepted. The Chief Conciliation Officer is still hopeful that a conference may be arranged.Dyers and Finisher s(Manchester). Representatives of both sides have had interviews with the Chief Labour Adviser, at which offers were made of the assistance of the department to overcome the difficulty which had arisen as to the appointment of a chairman of the arbitration court. It was proposed that the arbitrators nominated by both sides should meet the Chief Labour Adviser with a view to the joint selection of a chairman.Warehousemen (Liverpool).-Bj agreement of both parties the claim* of the National Warehouse and General Workers&apos; Union for the payment of the dockers&apos; rates to ware-&quot; housemen employed by Messrs. Ridgways, Ltd., was referred to the Negotiating Committee set up under Lord Shaw&apos;s report, on the definite understanding that, if the application was refused, the firm would negotiate direct with the union regarding increases of wages, any settlement to take effect as from the 25th August. The decision of the committee is that they have no jurisdiction in the matter. The firm interpret this decision as definitely establishing the fact that the men concerned do not come within the terms of Lord Shaw&apos;s report; and expect that local negotiations will now ensue with the union.
Ship Repair Trade (Mersey District). An officer from headquarters is in Liverpool and is endeavouring to find a way to a settlement of this disputedFurniture Porters (II.M. Office of Works). The Office of Works report that, after an extended trial, the arrangement under which porters at the Surplus Furniture Stores, Chiswick, engaged in collecting and unloading furniture, work additional time on five days a week, but do not work on Saturday, continues to work satisfactorily, and is proving economical.Fair Wages Advisory Committee.

JOINT STANDING INDUSTRIAL COUNCILS.Reports.Building. The Management and Costs Committee met, on the 19th October, to consider the views of the constituent bodies of the Council on the report on insurance against stress of weather. No unfavourable replies were received from the trade unions ; the employers&apos; associations were either prepared to pay up to 50 per cent, of &quot; wet time,&quot; or refused to consider the proposals favourably. In view of the negotiations between the Government and the Resettlement Committee, it was decided to take no further action for the time being. It was decided, however, to re-affirm adherence to the recommendation, that a scheme of insurance against stress of weather, conditions should beaset into operation.The Building Resettlement Committee met on the 20th October. A representative of the Employment Department explained the Unemployment Insurance Act, and answered questions regarding the provisions for supplementary schemes. The Committee approved, with slight amendments, the draft letter for circulation to the constituent bodies of the Council, recommending that, in return for the Government^ concessions regarding time lost on housing work owing to stress of weather, the employers and operatives should support the scheme for adult apprenticeship. A resolution was passed that protests should be sent to the Minister of Health against his action in circularising the trade unions regarding the committee&apos;s,s?negotiationsTand omitting to send copies to the employers&apos; associations. The chairman and vice-chairman were instructed to draft a letter to the Prime Minister, the Minister of Health/and the Minister of Labour, pointing out that the statements now appearing in the Press regarding the intention of the Government to apply dilution to the buildingljtrade are calculated to prejudice the reception of the committee&apos;s recom-mendations to the constituent bodies regarding augmentation by adult apprentices.Cable-Making. The Council met on the 20th October. It was decided to increase the representation of each side from 8 to 10, on the ground that the northern unions desire more adequate representation.The Council had referred the question of the establishment of joint works committees in the industry to a sub-committee. The sub-committee have reported that they have no recommendation to make. It is understood that this decision was taken, on the grounds that employers and operatives&apos; representatives alike fear that such committees might tend to prejudice the authority both of the Council and the trade unions, and might, in practice, deal summarily with matters which should properly be referred to the higher bodies. The matter, however, is expressly left open for further discussion should occasion arise. The Council have undertaken to consider the question of consolidating war wages and bonuses in the industry.Cooperage. The District Joint Council for the London, Eastern, Home and Southern Counties, met on the 15th October. They decided to recommend the full Council to pro-ceed with the preparation of a special scheme of unemployment insurance. A resolution was carried to the effect that employers of coopers should give immediate notice to the trade union officials of any vacancy in their cooperage departments. It was agreed that employers should be urged to take on apprentices up to the full proportion sanctioned.

minimum rates for the grades of local authorities previously agreed by the Council. No decision could be reached on the rates for the Rural District Councils and County Councils, nor could the Council agree to refer the matter for settlement to the National Council. It is understood that the situation will be reported by the trade union side to the National Council. The District Council for Northumberland and Durham met on the .15th October, and considered an interim report presented by the Grading Sub-Committee. The employers&apos; side objected to the proposals as to grading the area, and to the 44-liour week laid down by the sub-committee as the basis upon which suggested wage rates had been estimated.  The report was referred back for further consideration.The West Riding District Council met on the 21st October. The Standing Committee had previously referred back to the Council an application by the trade union side for an increase of the minimum rates in Grades A, B, C and D by 3d. per hour. After separate conferences of the two sides, the employers&apos; representatives declined to grant the appli-cation or to make any offer. The secretary of the trade union side thereupon moved that the Council be suspended sine die. The motion was not accepted by the chairman, and the trade union side withdrew.The executive committee of the District Council for the Northern Home Counties met on the 21st October, and agreed to recommend that the basic wages of adult women employees should be as follows: In Grade A (places where a penny rate produces over  1,000), 6d. per hour; Grade B (urban districts where a penny rate produces over  500 but less than  1,000), 5^d. per hour ; Grade C (all other areas), 5d. per hour. The com-mittee also agreed to recommend basic rates of wages to be increased by a fluctuating bonus, the working week to be one of 47 hours.The District Council for the South Midlands area met on the 22nd October. The recommendations of the National Council regarding payment of wages during sickness were adopted. Further basic rates were fixed for certain additional classes of workmen, to be included in the schedule now in operation, and the Basic Rates Committee were asked to prepare a scheme for wage increases owing to the increased cost of living.Needle, Fish-hook, Fishing Tackle and Allied Trades. The Council, on the 19th October, received a further report from the Wages Committee on the grading of various classes of workers not yet included in the grading scheme. Further progress was made in connection with the formation of a special class for training needle tool makers, the expenses of which will be borne by the employers&apos; side of the Council. A suggestion from the employers&apos; side that steps should be taken to contract out of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920, was considered, but the trade union representatives felt that they could not discuss this question until they had consulted their head offices.Quarrying. The Executive Committee met on the 19th October. An address on education was given by the liaison officer of the Board of Education, and discussed at some length. It was decided that the views of the various sections-on the subject should be ascertained before the next Council meeting in December. It was reported that, owing to the action of the Granite Section, the quarrying dispute in the North, of Scotland had been amicably settled. The labour side approved of the admission to the Council of representatives of the Operative Society of Stone Masons, Quarrymen, and Allied Trades, on the basis of the agreement reached by the Manchester Conference. It was resolved that the completion of the organisation of the Freestone Section should be pushed forward; and that steps be taken, as soon as practicable to form a Sectional National Council and District Councils for the Chalk Section, which is at present represented by one District Council meeting concurrently with a District Council of the Joint Industrial Council for the Cement Industry.itSurgical Instruments. On the 20th October, the Council discussed a proposal put forward by the employers for the technical training of boys from 14 to 16 years of age. These proposals were intended to supplement such compulsory education as is provided for under recent legislation. The scheme was referred to the operatives&apos; representatives for detailed consideration. The Council further discussed, the question of augmenting labour in the trade by increasing the number of apprentices. The employers suggested one boy to four men, counting as men boys of 18 who have received three years&apos; training. The operatives pointed out technical difficulties in the scheme as then framed, and the matter was adjourned to enable the operatives to suggest means of overcoming these difficulties.
GENERAL DEPARTMENT.TRADE BOARDS. PROCEEDINGS.Lace Finishing Trade Board. The Board resolved to issue a Notice of Proposal to vary the general minimum piece-rates, and the general minimum time-rates for workers other than learners and late entrants. It was agreed to represent to the Minister that, in spite of repeated requests, no effective steps had been taken to protect the industry from the effects of the much lower wages paid to outworkers in France, and to request that steps should be taken to secure some international regulation of wages, and that the whole matter should be brought before the next International Labour Conference.

The National Council met on the 22nd October. It was reported that one District Council was now in process of formation, and that arrangements had been made to hold conferences of the local authorities and staff associations concerned to consider the formation of District Coimcils for nine other areas.

The committee resolved, in view of the possible co-ordination of the Trade Boards for the metal trades, to recommend the Board to take no action at present with regard to the minimum rates for female workers employed on kick-stamping, but suggested to the Board the desirability of urging the represen-tatives of employers to press the members of their associations to prevent the increase in the number of women workers employed on men&apos;s work in this process. The committee resolved to recommend the Board to take no action with regard to the minimum rates for female workers employed on swing-turning lathes.Deputation from Trade Boards.

The Board have issued a Notice of Proposal, dated, the .18th October, to vary and fix minimum rates of wages for male and female workers.The general minimum time-rates and piece-work basis time-rates proposed for male workers, 22 years of age and over, other than learners, are Is. \\d. and Is. 3d!, per hour, respectively ; with general minimum time-rates ranging from Is. 1\d. to Is. %\d. per hour, and piece-work basis time-rates rang-ing from ls.t id. to Is. lOd. per hour, for certain specified classes of workers. Lower general minimum time-rates are proposed for male learners under 22 years of age. The general minimum time-rates proposed for female workers other than learners, are 8f d. per hour ; for workers employed as cutters, trimmers and fitters-up, 8fd. per hour for those under 19 years of age, 9 d. per hour for those of 19 and under 20, and 9f(l. for those 20 years of age and over. The rates proposed for female learners commencing at ages ranging from 14 years to 21 years of age and over, range from 9s. Zd. to 31s. Qd. per week of 48 hours. The piece-work basis time-rates proposed for female workers other than cutters, trimmers and fitters-up is 9fd. per hour. The Board also propose to fix overtime rates for male and female workers.
All divisions except the Wales Division report increases in the men&apos;s register, and all show increases in the &apos;women&apos;s register.Statistical information as to the effect of the miners&apos; strike will be found on page 503. The following summary of the state of employment relates to the week ending the 15th October.Mens Employment.Shipbuilding and Other Industries. Reports from the Exchanges received during the week deal with the position before the coal strike. While little change is recorded in the general outlook, the whole position altered materially for the worse when a strike became imminent.With regard to the shipbuilding and allied industries, reports from the Clyde indicate that firms have still sufficient orders to provide work for many of the unemployed if raw materials could be obtained as required. On the Tyne, further discharges of ship-repairers have taken place on the completion of work in hand. Ship-repairing on the Wear has been fairly good, but the shipbuilding and engineering trades are still greatly handicapped by a shortage of material. Except for a number of discharges from the works of Messrs. Bolckow, Vaughan &amp; Co., Ltd., South Bank, due partly to slackness and partly to the threatened miners&apos; strike, the previous satisfactory position on Tees-side still obtained at the time of reporting. On the Mersey the shipwrights&apos; strike still continues. Barn-staple report that shipbuilding is very brisk ; two ships of 1,800 tons are under construction, and other keels have been laid. In South Wales, unemployment is considerable at all ports, but it is probable that, so far as ships at present laid up in port are concerned, repairs which would have been deferred may now be undertaken during the coal strike.In the North-Western Division it is evident that the coal trade dispute transcends all other matters. One immediate effect of the imminent strike appears to be that employers are curtailing employment and suspending the engagement of new hands. At Manchester, for example, a large engineering firm have instructed the local Exchange to cancel their numerous vacancies forthwith. The employees of many large firms have received notice of discharge, and are on a day-to-day engagement. It is expected, how-ever, that most firms will continue work so long as coal stocks last. Apart from the coal question, however, the cotton industry is passing through a very difficult period. The unemployment position in certain districts had already become very serious. Manu-facturers with orders booked for the Eastern markets, South America, France and Italy, are complaining of orders being cancelled. This has left a large amount of goods made from high-priced materials on their hands. They cannot afford to cut their losses, and, as in some instances they cannot dispose of the goods except in the markets for which they were made, there is no alternative to holding their stock until trade improves.The settlement of the strike in the plain net section of the lace trade has improved the outlook in this industry to some extent. The reports in regard to the textile wool trade are far from encouraging. Short time is still marked in the boot and shoe, furniture and hosiery trades.   The pottery industry continues good.Industrial Developments-At Salisbury, additional work is being undertaken at the Royal Engineers&apos; experimental ground at Porton, which will increase the civilian staff from 50 to 200. The Agra Petroleum Co., Ltd., are making four berths for oil-fuel installations at Fawley, Southampton ; it is expected that the work, will last three years. At Torquay the South Devon Motor Co., Ltd., have acquired a large building for an extension to their workshop and garage. At Northallerton the conversion of a brewery into a yeast factory will probably provide employment for 150 to 200 workpeople.Shortage of Material. A shortage of cement is reported to be hampering building operations at Camberwell, High Wycombe and Walsall. A considerable number of unskiled workpeople have been discharged in the Deptord district owing to a shortage of material in the tin box trade. The construction of the new gas works at Belvedere, Kent, is being held up by a shortage of material.Women&apos;s Employment.General Industrial Situation. Local reports indicate in general an increase of short time and of discharges in most of the important staple industries, but show in certain areas some slight signs of improvement. This improvement was hampered by the pending coal strike, and now that the strike has taken place has been completely checked.Local Reports. The industrial areas of London continue to report increased discharges and short time.  At Leyton, large numbers of highly-skilled machinists in the clothing
trade have been discharged. In Stepney also the clothing trades are very slack. At Willesden, Messrs. S. Smith &amp; Sons, Ltd., manufacturers of electrical accessories, have discharged 200 women. Sheerness state that the furnaces for the new glass works at Queenborough have been fired, and that women and girls should shortly be required for inspection and packing.At Bristol, tailoresses and tinplate workers are on short time. Messrs. Fussell &amp; Co., Salisbury, manufacturers of condensed milk, tire discharging women. At Swindon a number of factory tailoresses are unemployed. The glove-making industry is beginning to show signs of slackness at Yeovil.The rubber and motor-cycle works are slack in Aston ; discharges are taking place from the motor works at Coventry; unemployment is increasing at Bromsgrove and is serious at Handsworth. The silk industry remains slack at Leek ; at Walsall, metal machinists, iron and steel goods workers, and leather goods makers are unemployed, and a number of tailoresses have been discharged.At Wednesbury and Willenhall, registers are steadily increasing ; at Worcester, dis-charges have occurred at sauce, leather trunk, leather button and tin works. In Burslem, Longton and Stoke-on-Trent, the pottery firms may be able to carry on for a week from the declaration of the coal strike. At Burton-on-Trent the hosiery trade is busier, full time being worked during the week.The boot industry remains slack in Leicester and Wellingborough, and in Northampton the depression is said to be increasing. The wholesale clothing trade and the rubber trade is also slack in Leicester. At Braintree a number of women have been restarted by Messrs. Courtaulds, Ltd., silk manufacturers, and by Messrs. Hollington, wholesale clothing manufacturers.At Bedford the Cosmic Crayon Co. have started work, and Messrs. Peek, Frean &amp; Co., Ltd., biscuit manufacturers, are requiring women for their packing room. Messrs. Jurgens, Ltd., Grays, margarine manufacturers, are discharging workers. At Watford, Messrs. North, engineers, have discharged about 100 women, and Messrs. Waterlow Brothers &amp; Lay ton, Ltd., have discharged 50 women from their paper mills.Throughout the Yorkshire and East Midlands Division under-employment is on the increase, and in some instances is developing into unemployment. Throughout the textile areas there are indications of bad trade affecting both the heavy woollen and fine worsted districts.The general position on the wholesale clothing trade is getting gradually worse, and unemployment in the lace, hosiery and leather industries is on the increase. There is still an unsatisfied demand for skilled workers in the silver trade. Over 2,000 women are on short time at Derby in the hosiery, lace and net, corset and surgical belt, cardboard box and boot and shoe industries. At Batley and Dewsbury, workers in the rag trades are on short time.Little change is reported from the North-Western Division. The cotton trade is still unsettled, and slight improvements reported from some districts have been checked by the coal strike. Depression is also felt in the wholesale clothing, shirt and under-clothing trades at Crewe and Levenshulme, the glove-making industry at Glossop, the silk making-up industry at Macclesfield and the slipper industry in Bacup.In Scotland many of the staple industries are slack. At Arbroath there is great depression in the flax industry ; hosiery knitters have been paid off at Aberdeen ; textile firms are slack at Barrhead, Bridgeton and Kirkcaldy. At Dunfermline there is no improve-ment in the linen industry, and the hosiery trade is.slack in Irvine. The jute industry continues slack&apos;in Dundee, and a number of jute workers are going on short time in Aberdeen.   The Exchanges are still supplying women for potato lifting.LOCAL EMPLOYMENT COMMITTEES.Activities of Committees.Employment and Resettlement-Committees in all divisions continue to approach their local authorities with a view to pushing forward, where possible, any public works or schemes which might tend to relieve unemployment. At Lincoln the City Surveyor has agreed to prepare a scheme which, would absorb unemployed workers of the light labouring type, who are mainly represented in the district.  A grant is being applied for.A report was submitted to the Bristol Committee of a conference held between representatives of the committee and the Somersetshire County Council with regard to the making of a new road between Wells and Weston-super-Mare.  The Council are prepared
* See this Report No. 7, 13th March, p. 232.to put the work in hand provided the necessary funds, approximately  300,000, are allocated by the Ministry of Transport. It was decided to forward full particulars to the Minister, and to ask him to receive a deputation within seven days.The Grimsby Committee have asked the Minister to approach the Development Commission with a view to the immediate commencement by the Great Central Railway Co., Ltd., of the new fish dock. They state that, for some years past, the company have been deriving extra remuneration by way of rates and dock dues for this purpose, and the congestion of shipping makes immediate action imperative. Though an extension of the time limit for the work has been given, no move, so far as is known, has yet been made, and the committee suggest the time limit now fixed should be final.Disabled Ex-Service Men. The Accrington Committee regard very seriously the growing number of cases in which disabled ex-Service men, totally incapable of work, are certified fit for employment, and strongly recommend that the Government absorb these men under a national scheme ,on such work as fruit culture, forestry or poultry farming.OUT-OF-WORK DONATION.Payments Made. Returns by the Finance Department, according to information received at the Claims and Record Office, Kew, for the week ending 14th October, show 178,328 payments to policy holders involving an amount of  184,755 3s. id.s UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE.Payments Made. The number of payments of unemployment insurance benefit made during the week ending the 8th October was 54,029, involving an amount of  27,827 3,s.DISCHARGED AND DISABLED SAILORS AND SOLDIERS.National Scheme.Up to and including, the 20th. October, 21,728 certificates have been issued to employers enrolled under the scheme. The undertakings given by these employers cover 231,894 disabled ex-Service men.The Stoke-on-Trent Exchange report a large increase in placings, due to the general Press campaign; but the Walsall Exchange report a period of severe trade depression, which has not only decreased the number of placings, but has thrown a number of disabled&apos; men out of employment. The manager of the Exchange comments that it would appear that disabled men are the first to be discharged by most firms.Placings.AtBirminghama man, badly disabled in the left arm, has been placed as an artist&apos;s model, and at Burslem a one-legged man has been placed with his pre-war employers at his old occupation of potters&apos; placer, his fellow workmen having consented to do the lifting-incidental to the work. At West Bromwich a deaf and dumb man has been placed as an ash wheeler. At Newcastle-on-Tyne a man suffering from shell shock has been placed as a groundsman at  l per day.JUVENILE BRANCH.Juvenile Employment Committees.Choice of Employment Schemes and Unemployment Insurance -After consultation with the Board of Education, a letter is being sent by the department to all local education authorities who are co-operating with the Ministry of Labour in the work of Choice of Employment Schemes, giving them formal intimation of the coming into force of the new Unemployment Insurance Act, and inviting their co-operation im dealing with juveniles who come under the Act.Hotel Work. A meeting of members of the local hotels&apos; association was recently held in Brighton to consider the methods of recruiting labour for hotel work. The members regarded training schemes, such as that instituted in London at the Westminster Technical Institute^ with little favour, although they considered that a central school training with
APPOINTMENTS AND TRAINING.APPOINTMENTS AND CIVIL LIABILITIES DEPARTMENT.APPOINTMENTS.Statistics. During the week ending the 15th October, the Appointments Department placed 510 candidates for appointments, bringing the total number of candidates known to have been placed to 42,868. Of these 5,801 were placed through the agency of the departments Interviewing Boards. Applications were registered from 862 ex-Service men and 34 civilians. The total number of candidates available for appointments on the 15th October was 11,753 ex-Service men and 1,622 civilians. At the same date, 1,284 &quot; live &quot; vacancies were at the disposal of the department, 649 having been registered during the week.R&amp;ports from Direclorates. In the Cardiff district placings are well maintained, in spite of dislocation of trade due to the coal strike. A special canvass is being made to follow up the appeal made by the Minister at Cardiff on the 16th October.The Director at Cambridge reports that there is a slight increase in the number of placings. Of the candidates who have appeared before the Luton Appointments Panel, 55 per cent, have now been placed by them. The panel stated that they would raise a fund to defray the expenses of those attending the panel who were not in a position to pay their fares, but they consider that the Government should be asked to devote a small sum to this purpose.The Controller of the. Appointments and Training Branch (Ireland) reports that the special course in Belfast in flax culture for officers going to the British East African Disabled Officers&apos; Co-operative Colony has terminated. The average weekly placings in Ireland during the first nine months of 1920 have been 48 a week, more than double the rate for the second half of 1919.   There is no reduction, however, in the live register.BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONAL TRAINING. -tMaintenance and Training Grants Scheme. During the week ending the 15th October the Appointments Department received applications for training under this scheme from 172 officers and men of equal educational qualifications, of which 97 were for training of the type provided by the department. Deducting cancellations and withdrawals, 28,263 applications for training of this latter type have been received in all, and 50,402 for training of the types provided by other Government departments.  The Interviewing BoardsEmployment and Insurance Department-continued.a bias towards hotel requirements would be a distinct advantage. The opinion was expressed that prospective hotel employees should spend some time abroad to gain the necessary experience, and that the enforcement of attendance at day continuation schools would result in the non-employment in hotels of workers below 16 years of age.Apprenticeship: Engineering Trade. Three Juvenile Advisory Committees are at present taking steps to secure the adoption of local schemes of apprenticeship in the engineering trade. The Dewsbury Committee have submitted a draft scheme to the local branches of the Amalgamated Engineering Union and to the Engineering Employers&apos; Federation. The Grays Committee are proposing to call a meeting of representatives of employers and workpeople in the trade, after full information regarding local conditions has been obtained. The Northampton Committee have invited employers to attend a meeting to discuss the question.Domestic Service. In some cases the Juvenile Employment Committees are succeeding in persuading more girls to enter domestic service, but this is attributed to some extent to the poor demand in other occupations. A recent report from Walsall, however, indicated that the local supply of domestic servants was greater than the demand.[Reference to matters of interest to the Employment and Insurance Department will also be found on pages 503, 505 to 507, 513, 514 and 526.]
have dealt to date with 27,165 applications, of which 22,808 have been recommended. The Grants Committee, dealing with applications so recommended, have received 21,666 applications and sanctioned grants in 17,868 cases.Training of Disabled Officers under Pensions Warrant. The Appointments Department have dealt with a total of 880 cases, in 418 of which the training sanctioned is provided by the Appointments Department and in the remainder by other Government departments. Candidates accepted by the Ministry of Labour have completed their training in 215 cases and abandoned training in 39 ; 139 are still in training and 25 are awaiting training.TRAINING DEPARTMENT. INDUSTRIAL TRAINING.Disabled and Other Ex-Service Men.Statistics. On the 20th October, 25,071 men were in training, as against 25,083 on the 13th October, and 25,102 on the 22nd September. There were 17,174 men awaiting training, the corresponding totals for the 13th October and the 22nd September being 17,219 and .18,984 respectively. The number of men whose training had been completed since the 1st August, .1919, was 18,521, the totals for the 13th October and the 22nd September being 18,085 and 16,820 respectively.The figures for the past two weeks suggest a slight but general retardation, probably attributable to uncertainty in the labour world. The weekly increase in the numbers of men in training, though checked during the later summer months by holidays and other causes, became continuous again in September. During October a tendency to fall off has again been shown. The waiting list has been reduced by 45 names only during the week; from June onwards, the average reduction was 300 or 400 each week. For the past fortnight the waiting lists in a number of divisions have shown a tendency to expand, although a fair average rate of placings in training has been maintained. In practically all divisions the industrial situation is enhancing seriously the difficulty of finding improvers&apos; vacancies.Pen Making. Sanction has been given to the training of men in gold pen making and vulcanite turning for a period of 18 months, on certain conditions.  .Exhibitions. At an exhibition of the work of ex-Service men trained by the City School of Art, Liverpool, a special section was devoted to disabled sailors and soldiers, some of whom could be seen at work.An exhibition and examination of baskets made by men in training under the Ministry of Labour scheme was held, at the Girdlers&apos; Hall, under the auspices of the Worshipful Company of Basket Makers, on the 15th October. About 100 exhibits were shown, and the Company awarded some 20 certificates of merit to trainees. The chairman of the National Trade Advisory Committee gave a prize to the value of  5 for the best specimen of work, and the Company awarded a special prize of  5 for a basket used for dipping metal in acid.Expenditure has been sanctioned for an exhibition at the Radnor Street Factory, Bristol, in December.Hostels, Canteens and Welfare. Welfare grants amounting to nearly  400 have been made to the Walker, Hornsey, Bristol and Beverly Factories. The United Services Fund have recently made a grant of  200 to the Tottenham (White Hart Lane) Factory.Government Instructional Factories. The Minister recently visited the Sarisbury Court and the Cardiff Factories and inspected the various courses in detail. In both cases satisfaction was expressed at the progress made, and the opportunity was taken to discuss questions raised by men in training and other persons connected with the Factory. A visit by Mrs. Macnamara to the Liverpool Factory was highly appreciated by the men, whose work she inspected.Returns show that, on the 28th September, 6,696 men were in training in factory conditions out of a total of 21,068. The proportion was highest in the North&apos;-Eastern Division, where, of 791 men in training, 670 were being trained under factory conditions.Good progress is reported at the newly opened Guildford Factory, the number of men in training having risen from 10 to 49. There are now- 20 men in training at the new Factory at Romford. At Norwich the number of men in training at the new factory nas increased from 37 to 71. The Woodhouse Lane Factory, Leeds, where there have ueen a good many vacant places, is now practically full.
Equipment and Supplies. Deliveries to Central Stores during the week included woodworking, tailoring, plastering, plumbing, shoemaking and engineering tools.National Trade Advisory Committees: Leather Goods. A meeting of the Committee was help! at St. Ermin&apos;s on the 18th October. With reference to a suggestion by the London Local Technical Advisory Committee that a trainee had a legal right to the minimum wage during the improver period, even though on short time, a resolution was passed that, while sympathising with the desire to provide an improver with a full weekly wage, the committee were unable to express an opinion which would legally possess binding effect.   Trainees should accept the conditions prevailing in the trade.The representative of the Master Saddlers&apos; Federation stated that he had received several letters from associations affiliated to the federation, objecting to the conditions of training in the retail saddlery and harness trade. It was resolved that the general secretary of the federation should be asked to circularise all the affiliated associations to obtain their opinion.Liocal Technical Advisory Committees: Brush Making. The secretary attended the inaugural meeting of the Norwich Committee on the 13th October. It was resolved that it was unnecessary to set up a training scheme in a Government Instructional Factory, on the ground that a disabled man could quite well be taught in an employees workshop. It was pointed out that, at present, there is great depression in the trade, and that most workmen are on short time. It was finally resolved that, at present, there are no openings for trainees, but the committee, at the first opportunity, would take and train as many men as the trade could possibly absorb.Local Technical Advisory Committees : Tailoring (Bespoke). The first meeting of the Bangor Local Technical Advisory Committee was held on the 13th October. The formation of this committee, which has been badly needed to supervise the training centre started by the Ministry of Pensions in February, 1919, was delayed owing to difficulty in obtaining nominations for the employers&apos; panel. The members have engaged to do their utmost to find the improvers&apos; vacancies urgently needed, but, in the present state of trade, this will be extremely difficult.Apprenticeships Interrupted by Service.Statistics. Up to the 20th October, agreements had been received at headquarters in respect of 44,303 apprentices under the 41 schemes approved. Grants had been sanctioned in respect of 42,160 apprentices, employed by 16,594 employers. The total number of agreements lapsed on the expiration of the appropriate period of training, or by mutual agreement between the parties, is now 12,130.Wages.-Frequent reference has been made to the difficulties experienced in inducing employers in Devonshire and Cornwall to pay the wages required by the scheme. It is now reported that some 40 ex-Service apprentices are unemployed in the building trades at Plymouth and Devonport. One firm suggested 15s. per week as an appropriate rate. Local headquarters have visited many employers on behalf of these apprentices, but the prospects of placing them locally are far from bright.Applications. Further reports in regard to apprentices who have been unable to find employers are on the whole satisfactory. Local headquarters for the West Midlands record excellent progress in spite of the falling-off in trade. In Birmingham, for instance, the Exchanges report only nine apprentices &quot; unmated.&quot; There are also a few at Wor-cester. In the London and South-Eastern area several further districts are reported to have no &quot; unmated &quot; apprentices. At Newcastle-on-Tyne the Civic Committee, formed by the Lord Mayor to deal with all classes of ex-Service men, are making a special effort on behalf of the remaining &quot; unmated &quot; apprentices. At Stockton-on-Tees, and also at Jarrow, only one apprentice remains &quot; unmated.&quot;Acceptance or Non-Acceptance.-Progress is reported in bringing apprentice plumbers at Edinburgh under the scheme in accordance with Lord Hunter&apos;s award; apart from special cases to be considered by a joint conference of the trade, agreements have been completed in most cases.Training in Operation: Progress. Messrs. Thwaites Bros., Bradford, engineers, take special pains over the training of their apprentices. Movement from one sort of work to another is assured, progress is thoroughly checked, and most careful records are kept. The apprentices are in charge of the labour manager, and local headquarters report that &quot; the class of work done tends to repetition and there would be great risk of imperfect training if it were not for his excellent work.&quot;
Institutional Training. Applications are coming in well both at the Manchester School of Technology and the Salford Koyal Technical Institute. Training in the former institution appears to be particularly sought after, and several apprentices from other areas have asked for it. The printing classes appear to be specially valued; and the combination of half-time institutional training with half-time in the workshop is regarded as an admirable method of training. At Salford the facilities in engineering have consider-ably increased since last year, and there are also facilities at Bolton.In the Yorkshire and East Midlands area there has recently been an increase in applications, which is attributed to slackness in various industries.General Training: Apprentices and Boys.Apprenticeship: Building Industry. The President of the Leeds Master Builders, Association regards the proposals of the national scheme as admirable in theory but unworkable in practice. In particular, difficulty may arise where builders have contracts outside their own towns and recruit their labour locally. At Newark-on-Trent the complaint is made that the wages rates of the national scheme are too high, and will tempt firms to keep apprentices on remunerative work to the disadvantage of their training.Exploitation of Apprentices: Pattern-Making. A Liverpool firm draw attention to the serious results which follow the employment of apprentices by firms whose range of work is limited. They instance a boy who was employed for three years in making patterns for stair-rods ; when he came to them he was quite unable to make very simple patterns of other kinds. The firms consider that this &quot; practice amounts to serious exploitation and should be put a stop to.&quot; They advocate the definite organisation of training, and the development of a permanent scheme of State supervision.Welfare Work: Wales. The recreation scheme in the Rhondda Valley is making headway. In spite of considerable extremist opposition, committees, on all of which the miners are represented, have been formed at the Treorchy, Ynysybwl and Ogmore mining centres. The Ocean Colliery, Ltd., Treorchy, have guaranteed 50 per cent, of the initial outlay, and a welfare supervisor has been appointed. The welfare scheme at Port Talbot is also making excellent progress, and the hearty co-operation of the local steel manu-facturers has been promised. On the other hand, great difficulties are being experienced at Barry and Morriston, as employers are unwilling to continue to provide the necessary funds,[Reference to matters of interest to the Appointments and Training Departments will also be found on pages 503, 505 to 507, 513, 514, 521, and 522.]
APPENDIX.QUESTIONS  IN PARLIAMENT.The following extracts from the Official Report of the proceedings of the House of Commons relate to questions in which the Ministry is interested.Minimum Wage Bill.Major Barnes asked the Prime Minister whether he can state when the Bill dealing with the establishment of a minimum wage will be introduced?,Mr. Bonar Law : I hope that it may be possible to proceed with this Bill during this Session.  ([9th October.)Unemployed Disabled Ex-Service Men.Major Barnes asked the Prime Minister if he has received a resolution passed by the Newcastle-upon-Tyne War Pensions Committee at their last meeting stating their opinion that the limit of assistance which could be rendered by local authorities and private employers of labour in connection with the provision of suitable employment for unemployed disabled ex-Service men had now been * reached, and urging the Government to take immediate steps to house, maintain and provide with suitable employment all disabled ex-Service men who, through their disability or other cause beyond their control, have not yet been absorbed into the various industries of the nation ; and if he will say whether the Government concur in the view therein expressed and will give effect to the proposals made ?Dr. Macnamara : I have been asked to reply to this question. On the evidence before me, I cannot agree that the limit of assistance which can be rendered by local authorities and private employers in this matter has yet been reached. There is, I am glad to say, still a continuous increase in the number of local authorities and private firms who are helping, through the medium of the National Scheme for the Employment of Disabled Ex-Service Men.As to local authorities, the results are not even yet very satisfactory, although there has been considerable recent improvement. I understand that one month ago the position in England and Wales was that 382&apos; local authorities had been enrolled, out of a total of 2,514 (excluding parish councils). In Scotland, the total number of county and municipal authorities which had adopted the scheme was 25, out of 236 (excluding parish councils). With the concurrence and support of my right hon. Friends the Minister of Health and the Secretary for Scotland, I have recently appealed to local authorities, urging upon them that, particularly in view of the considerable influence which they are able to exercise within their respective districts, they should not only enrol under the National Scheme, but do everything they can to secure that the question of the employment of disabled men is taken up in each locality with all possible vigour. Up to date, additional under-takings have been received, bringing the total of local authorities covered in England and Wales up to 430, whilst applications are being considered in other cases.As regards employers generally, there was a further material increase in the number of firms on the National Roll between the beginning of June when 16,989 firms were on the Roll and the 30th July, when the figure was 18,975. The number of disabled men employed by these firms at the beginning of June was 140,759, which number had increased on the 30th July to 176,889.It is clear that there is still a great opportunity for all classes of employers working together to remove the disabled ex-Service men entirely from the category of the un-employed, and I desire to associate myself in this matter most completely with the appeals on this subject which have been made recently by Field-Marshal Earl Haig and others.As indicating the attitude of the Government on the matter, I may refer to the facts that the name of His Majesty&apos;s Treasury has now been placed on the Roll on behalf of Government departments and also on behalf of Government industrial establishments, while the percentage of disabled men employed by Government departments is, in actual practice, considerably higher than the minimum necessary under the Scheme. (19th October.)DEBATES  IN PARLIAMENT.Unemployment.A full debate on the unemployment position took place on the 21st October on the motion of Mr. Adamson, &quot; That this House views with regret the growing volume of unemployment, and, recognising the responsibility of the State towards members of the community who are bereft of the means of livelihood, is of opinion that every possible step should be taken to arrest the decline in trade and industry, and to provide work, or, in default, adequate maintenance, for those whose labour is not required in the ordinary market.&quot;
