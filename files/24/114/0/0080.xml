Vessels with repatriateo Russian prisoners of war will be met by Soviet cfaft outside the entrance to the harbour and prisoners transferred.BULGARIA.
*r 4 -BULGARIA.Die Conference cf Ambassadors inferred the Bulgarian Delegation cn 27th October that BULGARIA is to keep strictly to the terras cf the Treaty and is not to set up a War Fleet..ITALY.The Conference of Ambassadors has considered a series of questions as to the precise character of the equipment Which the German Government are to hand over with the light cruisers and destroyers which are to be incorporated in the Italian Fleet and has decided that this is to include reserves of ammunition and guns corresponding to the quantities allowed to the German fleet and a?so fresh guns to replace those now in the vessels which are reported to be unserviceable, pro-vided they have been rendered unserviceable by neglect or sabotage and not   by wear and tear.   The leral&apos; advisers are to be asked whether the term &quot;equipment&quot; is regarded as covering na\dgaticnal and other auxiliary gear.The Conference of Ambassadors at a meeting on 1st November announced that the U.S. Government was now willing to hand over to Italy the two ex-Austrc-Hungarian Battleships &quot;Radets&amp;y&quot; and &quot;Zrinyi&quot; at present under United States Guard at Spalato.

-   412t*   ...ggMRAL   INTELLIGENCE.AFGHANISTAN.Increasing recruiting activity is reported in Kabul.     Jemel Pasha and bis party left Herat for the capital at the beginning of this month.PERSIA.The new Prime Minister has issued proclamation setting forth reasons for the dismissal of the Russians and the advantages likely to accrue through this action.    The attitude of the Press is satisfactory and two papers have even published helpful articles.    Starosselski and his family are due to leave for Mesopotamia on November 6th for deportation. In the meantime a Persian has been appointed as nominal head of the Cossack Brigade and its re-organisa-tion is taking place.The attitude of the Russian officers      the Cossack Brigade is satisfactory and practically all are glad to avail themselves of a free Dassaga out of the country.The elections for the Med^liss are proceeding and it is hoped that it will be able to open within a -month.General Ironside, after the recent debacle of the Persian Cossack Brigade had to make a reconnaissance towards the North and found the Bolsheviks entrenched with machine-guns, cavalry and field-guns.    They were uniformed and disciplined.     In an engagement which took place the Bolsheviks suffered not less than 40 casualties while the British forces had 3 killed and.6 wounded.    The Bolshevik forces were forced to retire.    The Persian Cossacks/retired behind the British troops under night.MESOPOTAMIA.The situation in Mesopotamia shows continued signs of improvement although it is still necessary to carry out some further operations between Hi11ah and Samawa, as well as punitive measures in other directions.    The Brigade operating at Xerbala have established and wired posts round there and the town is quiet.     One of our aeroplanes was shot down south, east of Hillah hut before the insurgents could capture the Airmen another machine landed, took them on board, and made good its escape.     The insurgents, however, burned V-e abandoned machine.RUSSIA.Crimea.    Red offensive has commenced on the Tavrida.front. General Wrangel has withdrawn to the Perekor line and heavy fighting is taking place.    white troops are confident and moral is- reported to be very good.     On 2nd November Wrangel occupied the following line:- Liman - Utlyutski - Yuritsino. Situation in the Perekop sector quiet.POLAND.part ii.
POLAND.The Vllna ooup.     On the 38 th October, the Council of the League of Nations passed a resolution, whioh was accepted .by the Polish Government, whereby the allocation of the Vilna area was to be decided by a plebiscite of the inhabitants, under arrangements to be made by tho League. In the meanwhile, both sides were called upon to cease hostilities.     Otherwise no appreciable change for better or worse has taken place in the situation.    Some fighting&apos;, between General Zeligowskl&apos;s troops and the Lithuanians, has taken place north and north-east of Vilna, towards Dwinsk;   but hostilities, except for an air raid on Wilkomir (north-east of Eovno), on the 1st November, appear to have been of a purely local nature, and not to have boon participated in by Polish forces proper.Danzig.    The polish Government has instructed IF, Paderewski to sign the treaty with the ^ree City of Danzig provided Poland be granted -(l) the mandate for the protection of the frontiers of Danzig.(0,) tho former imperial dockyard, the Island ofPoln and certain other property formerly owied by the German Government.(3) effective control of the Vistula.The date fixed by the Council of Ambassadors for the signing of the treaty (15th November) remains unaltered.It is hoped that it will be possible to withdraw the British and French troops from Danzig in December.Tho Polish Government has officially denied any intention of a coup dl6tat on Danzig for whioh they are said to be preparing according to the press.The acting High Commissioner has forbidden all political meetings in oonnection with the Danzig-Polish Treaty.Direct negotiations are now taking place between Italy and Jugoslavia on the Adriatic question.     The meetings are being held on the Italian Riviera, and both sides appear to be animated with the most sincere desireVenizolos has now made the question of the succession to the throne a direot issue of the elections.Tfino&quot; operations by Greek troops in the TJshak and Gediz aroa have terminated successfully.ITALY.to reach an agreementARMENIA.
The Georgian Government have so far avoided any definite commitment as to the conclusion of an Alliance with Armenia against tho Katdonai.is.ts and bolsheviks&apos;.    It appears probable that they are awaiting some definite assurance of support from the Allies before pledging themselves to active military operations.The Armenian Government continues to appeal for arms, ammunition a-nd clothing, and also for an allied occupation of Trebizond.The S.N.O, Batoum reports that Kars has been captured by the Nationalists and that the Armenian forces have fallen back on Alexandrupol.In Southern Armenia the inhabitants are said to have risen against the Bolsheviks and to have expelled them from  the district of Sangezur.The French have made a rapid advance from Wazzan to the Northward and.are now in occupation of the country as far as the frontier of the Spanish zone.The Spanish Column advancing; on Snssbouan frojn Larache has met with determined resistance and at one time was reported to have suffered severely and to be in serious difficulties,     General Berenguer however now denies this and reports that the column, is engaged In constructing bridges over the ^iver Lukkus, with a view to establishing communication with French forces operating from Vazzan. Ho reports however from French sources point to any intended plan of Military co-operation on the part of the French.SYHIA.Northern Syria and Cilicia.It is reported that French reinforcements, amounting to 16,000 men have reached Cilicia, and that they have cleared the surroundings of Adana and have advanced to Bozanti.    Tarsus and the Adana Railway are now free-. According to the Press, Armenian refugees recently deported are being- sent back to Adana.Had^in fell into the hands&apos; o-* the Nationalist Turks on 16th October.     According to Press reports, 10,000 Armenians were massacred when the town fell, and it is thought that there are few survivors.    Two factors which add to the appalling character of this disaster, are the well authenticated report that the French Authorities actually prevented an Armenian relief column fr^m rendering-assistance, and the probability that the massacres were carried out pith arms and munitions supplied to the Nationalists by Italy.The caravan-tr^de has been resumed between 7)eir -Sz-zor and Aleppo.SOOTH CHINA.
SOUTH   CHINA.General Caen Chiung Winpr, who has advanced from tfukien on Canton, has now occupied t^at city and driven out his political opponents.     It appears that disorder sufficiently serious to endanger the lives o^ foreigners is no longer feared.    The President of China is endeavouring to improve the occasion by issuing mandates stating that China is now reunited.JAPAN AND SIBERIA.The evacuation of Harbarovsk by the Japanese was completed by 21st October 1920, and the W/P Station was handed over to the Russians.
