The extremists fought hard for rejecting the Government terms and the decision hung in the balance until the last moment, when a majority v/as obtained for the principle that if a tv/o-thirds majority was required for a strike, a two-thirds majority was required for a continuance of a strike.It is not at all certain that all the men will go back at once, but a great many will and the others must follow their example in a few days.   They are getting short of money and the Co-operative Societies are giving them credit guaranteed by the Federation.   This guarantee will now be withdrawn.The Bolshevik courier Veltheim, a Finn, was sentenced to six months&apos; hard labour and deportation.   Special attention is called to the appendix to this report, in which are extracts from the British &quot;Red Officers Course&quot;, which was found upon him.There are indications that the arrest of this man and of Miss Pankhurst and the exposure of the extremist efforts to extend the miners&apos; strike are producing a reaction against the revolutionaries.   There is a very general demand for&apos;the suppression of revolutionary speeches and literature, and it is certain that if legislation were introduced, providing a penalty for receiving money from abroad for revolutionary purposes and for sumnary procedure for sedition, the.evil would be greatly abated.Labour/
- E -labour has suffered a defeat at the Municipal elections in spite of an unusually strenuous campaign.Practically no disorder has occurred in any part of the country in consequence of the Sinn Fein demonstrations follow in the death of MacSwiney.   2he extremist Press, which is unusuall; violent this week, has been in mourning for him.Information from a reliable source reports that little short of  2,000,000 worth of gems of Russian origin have reached the country during the last few weeks.   This has reduced the value of diamonds sold in Hatton Garden from  35 a carat to  18.   The various revolutionary societies, normally in financial difficulties, have been unusually affluent. Steps are being taken to verify this information.The &quot;Daily Herald&quot; has published a certificate showing the following average sales of the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;:August 300;OilSeptember        329;869 &apos;    October &apos; 298,511 ,a fall of 31,358 daily^in one month.   This is believed to be a great understatement.
THE) COAL MIHBRSAs announced in this morning&apos;s papers the delegates1 conference decided yesterday to. advise the men to resume work to-day.   The decision hung in the balance up till almost the last moment.   Violent speeches were made by the extremists, but in the end the more moderate men had their way and carried on a vote the resolution that if two-thirds majority was required for a strike, two-thirds was necessary for a continuance of a strike.   Although temporarily defeated, the extremists will continue their campaign against the steadier officials and the path of the federation will not be smooth.   It is clear that revolutionaries like A. J. Cook are consolidating their position and it is quite possible that there may be resignations of the more responsible officials in the near future.There was a majority of 8,459 against accepting the Government offer.   Lancashire and Cheshire, South Wales, Nottinghamshire and the Forest of Bean polled a majority against acceptance, and in L^jacashire the adverse votes were 82*77$ of those castj in South V/ales 65,49$,   The total vote was 684,549, as compared with 816,526 at the second ballot and 845,647 at the first ballot.   The ni:mber of abstentions was therefore very large indeed and it is fair I   to assume that the men who abstained from voting were against a continuance of the strike.The detailed figures of the last ballot are as followsSouth Wales/

An attempt was made to ,,:et men to the poll by paying out strike pay on (Tuesday instead of Friday, but even this failed to a large extent.   T e       were beginni^ to run short of money and the,Co-operative Sooieties were giving credit guaranteed by the federation.An attempt has been made to gather the opinion of other workers on the proposed settlement.  Most of them appear to think the Government offer a victory for the miners, though the more thoughtful are saying that the miners v/ould have done better to have accepted the datum proposal.THE/
THE KRITISH BED ABMYOn November 2nd Erkki Veltheim alias Anderson alias Carlson alias ftubinstein was sentenced to six months&apos; hard labour and deportation.   This man was known to have been the chief Bolshevik courier in Great Britain for the past six months, but a3 he entered the country as a stowaway and failed to register and every effort was made to keep his identity concealed, he eluded the Police for a considerable time.   He had, however, contracted a love affair with Miss Gilberts on and this was his undoing He was arrested when leaving the flat of Mr. Malone, M.P. who, nevertheless, denied on oath at Bow Street any knowledge of him.   Among the mass of documents seized at the time of the arrest was a &quot;Red Officers1 Course&quot;, of which Malone is believed to have been the author. Extracts from this document are given as an appendix to this report.   There can bo no doubt that Malone committed perjury, for Yeltheim, when applying to see his friends at the conclusion of the case, mentioned Malone as one of them,Malono made a speech in the North of England a few days ago, inviting recruits for the Bed Army.   The speech has boon submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions. , He is believed to be conducting a Red Officers&apos; Training Course at 21a, Maiden Lane.   Steps are being taken.to verify this.   In any case, it is not improbable that criminal proceedings will have to be taken against him before long.UNEMPLOYMENT,Meetings of unemployed have been held throughout the country, but the speeches made contained nothingnew/
new.   Tho largest London gathering was at Trafalgar Squarj on October 21st;   about 1,000 people were present, but many of them were casual spectators who were not in       g sympathy with the speakers.   H. Sara has spoken at Hacknsjj and Finsbury Park meetings.   There are rumours of forthcoming attacks on London Labour Exchanges.Unemployment in the provinces appears to be inoreasirl but the prominence given to various suggestions and measml of relief appears temporarily to have steadied the men.MUNICIPAL ELECTIONSBeturns so far obtainable indicate that of 747 Lrboi candidates, 199 have been successful, while 548 were defeated. In view of the special campaign, Labour has had a decided rebuff, due in all probability to its reckless finance. An interesting example of Communist candidates&apos;propaganda has been received from Siilford; it reads as follows:-REVOLUTIONCAPITALIST DEFINITIONBloodshedRed Flaas Red Herrings LopeThe peaceful taking ove; of the means of Life viflEH YOU ARE READY How then Workers,   .

*.   k   mREAITIOH iQAIHSS REVOLUTIONThe exposure of Russian subsidized communist intrigue has had an excellent effect in Birmingham,to which revolutionary speakers have of late devoted special attention.   last week Shepperson, who had previously been arrested and bound over, met with a hostile1 reception and on the audience suggesting that he should be tarred, hia meeting came to an abrupt conclusion.On October 29th Harvey was severely heckled by anaudience of about 200 who probably objected to beingaddressed as &quot;bellow wage slaves, tame rabbits and mugs.&quot;The following conversation ensued:Harvey:      &quot;Our editor, Sylvia Pankhurst, has been sentenced to 6 months1 imprisonment because she had the pluck to tell these parasites that before long the Army and Navy would he on the side of the workers.   I don&apos;t care if 1 get 6 months.&quot;Audience:Harvey:&quot;They ought to give you 6 months.&quot;Hear.   Hear I &quot;lou are a b- Bolshevist and you ought to be drowned.&quot;Pull him off the b- platform, he gets paid for that job.&quot;&quot;Fellow wage slaves, this dirty rag in my hand, the Lloyds Hews,&apos; is -drumming it into you that the Bolshevists are&apos; mixrderers.&quot;Audience:   &quot;So they are and so are you.&quot;(Harvey then got down whilst the audience were holding small meetings of their own)Harvey:Audience: Harvey:Audience:&quot;As you tame rabbits are satisfied with the conditions laid down, then all I can say is that you deserve all you get.&quot;&quot;How do you get your living?  I expect you are living on Bolshevik Gold.&quot;&quot;Yes, I wish I was, I Ts&amp;uid not refuse  75,000 like the   &quot;Daily Herald&apos; did, I wish Lenin would send me 75,000 pence. I:&apos;d soon damn well take it and so would you^&apos;&quot;No we wouldnVt, we don&apos;t want that b-Russian Gold, neither do we want the likes Of you oomiLg here and preaching revolution.&quot;As the orowd was becoming hostile, Harvey said:&quot;Comrades/
REVOLUTIONARY education the importance1 attached by labour to revolutionary education is emphasised by a letter sent by tho Fife, Kinrosj and Claokmannon Mine Workers Association to the Scottish Labour College, enclosing a cheque for  475.   &quot;This money represents a maintenance allowance voted by members of the Assb ciation to * three students.... The1 money is to be allo cate] in the following proportion:    .100,  175 and  200.&quot; (MIt is interesting to note that the Stenhousemuir Co-operative Society has made arrangements with the ScottishT. tbQT&quot;Comrades, itTs no uae rae trying to speak any more. I will conclude &quot;by asking you to buy the f Workers1 Dreadnought1 and read it for yourselves.&quot;In Coventry there is also evidence of reaction against fjthe extremists;   the loyal ex-Service men appear to have started a campaign of organised heckling and state that ifthe authorities will not give them a lead &quot;to put down theBed Flag business&quot; they will take matters into their omhands.   The men have devoted special attention to Tom Dingley]who was hustled off his platform and only saved from a-fighte.i %o, e&apos;e,.L ;:&apos;.eee ve jec$ eev/ \\avi-&apos;&apos;^k e-; \.e &apos;^\y4o.&apos;$v*j: trOby the intervention of the police.f&amp;&amp;W* ee iraa-o^aa %itfmp*sq. odv; CM Je:^:.e to e-eeK ,eeThe Emergency Powers Bill has produoed something akin to consternation among the extremists, but the general publicl has expressed strong; approval of the measure,THS NATIONAL UNION Off -BS-SKRVIOB. imAstonishment is expressed in Coventry regarding the funds at the disposal of the local branch of the National Union of Ex-Service Men&apos;.

. &apos;    364Labour College for a class to bo lectured by John McLean. The students are reported to have expressed &quot;unbounded delight&quot; that his services had been secured.THE CO-OPERATIVE MOVEMENTOn October 30th the 120 left wing delegates of the Co-operative movement held a conference at Derby, with the abject of compelling directors to conform with the policy of the group,   $he delegates, who represent only about 60 retail societies decided on a questionnaire to be submitted to every new candidate seeking election to the Co-operative Wholesale $ooiety Board.   This questionnaire is intended to draw from the candidates a definition of their attitude to the political activities of the society.The Co-operative Press evinces considerable anxiety as to the need for more oapital in the movement and eleven speoial conferences are to be held, from November 10th to November 25th, as part of the &quot;great co-operative campaign for capital.&quot;  Eight of these meetings will be addressed by Burt Williams of the Co-operative Wholesale Society&apos;s Financial Propaganda Department.AgggSTSOn November 1st Robert Jones and A.E. Stoneham were charged at Marylebone Police Court with &quot;unlawfully disturbing the peace and inciting others to commit crimes and misdemeanours against the peace.&quot;   They were remanded, bail being refused.THE MTRMST PRESSInfuriated by the failure of the miners1 strike as a prelude to revolution and by the firmness of the Governmentin/
in regard to tho lord Mayor of Cork, the extremist presshas this week revelled in an orgy of abuse,   &quot;The Worker&quot;,organ of the Scottish Workers1 Committee,  contains the&apos; ...following passages, between heavy mourning lines:&quot;Out of it3 tortured casket the inconquerable spirit of Terence MTSydney has flown ...&quot;Others are suffering pangs identical with his and for a similar piirpose: and while they do so (and while he did so) the great inarticulate, inert mass cf soulless,, selfish, and besotted clay called the British&apos; working class  oes on reading its foot-ball and sporting new3, and acquiescing in the foul and bloody deeds of the filthiest, slimiest, and mo3t bestial politicians that ever cut.a countryTs throat ...&quot;Eia&apos;avengers will&apos;be Irishmen.   Of a surety they will be - for Ireland, breeds the rebel.   If Lloyd George and his minions believe in a God, let them pray to Kim.   MTSwiney will.not travel his dark and unknowable journey with the ignominy they will carry.with them. ,&quot;Let the tyrants, tremble I   Lo&apos;c them shake in their coward shoes1.   Let their evi^. faces blanch with fear\ ...&quot;Misbegot spawn of wombs envenomed, may the day soon come when their loathsome carrion shall be devoured by.the sevrer rats of their skull-strewn Empire.   The blight is upon them already.   They quake at the nearness of their doom.   The slaying of the poet-hero is but symptomatic of that madness with which the Gods afflict those whom they desire to destroy.   Let us do the work of the Gods.&quot;In the same paper J, R, Campbell deals with the organisatiof the unemployed;&quot;The present unemployed crisis is not an ordinary trade glut.   It is due to the collapse of capitalist production and exchange over the greater part of Europe.   Nothing but,a MraciUous reversal of the present Allied attitude to Russia and Germany; nothing but a greater agreement amongst the Allies on economic questions can prevent the situation from becoming worse.   Such a &quot;miracle&quot; is unlikely,&quot;Both the employed and unemployed must realise that the end of all their efforts must be to smash the power of the capitalist state, take possession of the y/orkshops, and run them on behalf of the whole working&apos; class,&quot;The &quot;Vanguard&quot; prints the following passage, do&apos;ubtles written by the editor, John Maclean:&quot;Greenwood1
&quot;Greenwoods comb-out starts with the letting &apos; of Fitzgerald, one of the Cork hunger-strikers, die, and with the forcible feeding, with what looks like drugged food, of the Lord Mayor Of Cork, Terence MacSwiney.   Since recent feeding, the Lord Mayor has had attacks of delirium.   Is he being secretly tortured?   Having had some, I tell the world that he is.   If the English fancy that this terrorism is going to orush the Irish I am afraid they are mistaken. Ireland, keep on; you are winning the world on to your side.&quot;Under the heading &quot;Stray Straws&quot; from the same pen thefollowing passages occur:&quot;These fiends in human form, parading &amp;s the &quot;Government1 of the British Snpire, have flooded the country v/ith leaflets and posters denouncing Russia and the Bolsheviks for tho shedding of imaginary blood ...&quot;Lloyd George and his gang in power are robbers and murderers.   They rob the Irish of their country and murder the patriots who stand by their native land.   Comrades, champion IrelandTs cause with trebled energy and thus avenge the martyred Lord Mayor. Never in all our reading of history have we read of a slower and more cruel torture than that practised in , Brixton prison,   fio cruelty perpetrated by the Belgians on the Congo rubber plantations, no cruelty perpetrated by the Spaniards and other laropeans on the&quot;natives of America, no brutality of the slave-snatcners of Central Africa, no torture of Asians by the merchant princes of Europe ever excelled in refinement of cruelty this deliberate slaughter of a hero who will rank beside the greatest martyrs of the world.   Down with the bloody Government that attempts to do such deeds in our name.   Down with the system of greedy Capitalism that develops bloodraania in Its dominant class.&quot;The &quot;Socialist&quot;, the organ of the Socialist LabourParty, asks in the leader, &quot;Are we faced with a revolutionarysituation&quot; and answers its question in the affirmative.Detailing the advice given by Mr. J. H. Thomas &quot;the labourtraitor&quot; in regard to the miners1 strike, the articlecontinues, in thick type:&quot;The above advice to a starving working class is a monstrous inault.   It means that when you are struck down by a bully you have to respect, his filthy carcase.   It means that when Capitalism reduces you to starvation and misery, when it is dripping with the blood of your class, when it has drawn every ounce of energy from the flesh of Labour, when it has committed a thousand crimes upon your class, crimes which would be humanely rewarded by the sword - when it has done all these things, you have to turn round and orawl before it like a wounded dog pleading mercy from its slayer.   The crimes that have been committed against labour bear the hall-mark of murder most foul, and oan only he met by the organised weapon of prole tarian revenge.&quot;&quot;Millions/
&quot;Millions to-day are in starvation.&quot;Millions are unemployed.&quot;Millions are held in subjection by force.&quot;Millions are to be drummed into submission by capitalist hirelings.   While the real problem is the means of life - to ensure the right to live and work -labour must own the mines, railways, shipping, factories, workshops, stores and all distributive agencies.   The real character is at present showing itself.   The army will be organised to beat down the workers.   The navy will be organised to beat down the workers.   The police will be organised to beat down the workers.   Spies, agents and provocateurs will be kept to help beat down the workers. Treacherous labour leaders will be used to beat down the - workers.   Behind all these agencies Capitalism will be found operating to club the revolutionary masses, the rising working class, who must, on their part, realise the gravity of class war when they go forth to battle with something more substantial than empty phrases.&quot;The revolutionary workers must organise to save themselves.&quot;With the destruction of the monster - Capitalism -the path to real life is clear.&quot;Ex-Colonel Malone, M.P., contributes an article &quot;from the Gasworks&quot; to the current issue of his party&apos;s organ,&quot;The Communist&quot;:&quot;The Executive Committee of the Imperialistic and Capitalist Brigands met again on Tuesday.   The opening debates were good examples of the mockery and humbug of Parliamentary institutions...&quot;The coal miners must realise this: Parliament -the official organ of capitalism - with its conservative bureaucracy, paid Cossacks and White Guard army and navy, will never help the workers; even a concession of extra wages will be more than counteracted by increases in the oost of commodities to the community, who are the workers, so long as capitalism controls the banking and financial machinery .....&quot;A fair deal can only be achieved when the workers own and control the means of wealth production in this country, and they must prepare for the day when they may have to seise them.   Rely on no help from the lackeys of the capitalist in Parliament such as Brace, Adamson &amp; Co,. Their speeches are not worth quoting -&apos;Thomas18 speech has already&quot;been reproduced in block type articles in the Sunday Press, which shows you how valuable he is to the employers...&quot;&quot;On Friday, Home Secretary Shortt brought in the Emergency Powers Bill, which allows the Government to   ,, take monster anything, control anything, arrest or imprison anyone in the coming class war - in fact justifies        * repetition of the Cossack tactics we witnessed in        H Whitehall last Monday.&quot;This/
&quot;This is the sort of oppression the workers in Russia experienced under Tsardom.&quot;I hope the workers of this land will bear in mind what happened to Tsardom in Russia, and overthrow it in this oountry, too.&quot;In regard to MaloneTs speech on unemployment, which the&quot;Communist&quot; and &quot;The 7/orker&quot; reproduce at some length, thelatter paper writes:&quot;We print below the major portion of Cecil Malonels speech in the House of Commons on October 21st,   This speech, delivered by the lonely champion of communism and labour, scarifies both capitalists and labour fakirs.   It was completely boycotted by the Press -including the 1Daily Herald&apos; which has altered some these days.&quot;THE &quot;DAILY HERALD&quot;The project of starting a Northern edition of the &quot;Daily Herald has been   renewed and a conference of Trade Unions, called by the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; Trade Union Committee will oonsider the matter.   The &quot;Daily Herald&quot; hopes &quot;that the delegates to this conference will be in a position to state what financial assistance the powerful Northern Trade Unions are prepared to render.&quot;There has latterly been a slight increase in the business advertisements in the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;.A well known diamond dealer in Hatton Garden states that during the last few weeks diamonds to the amount of little short of  2,000,000, most of which are pronounced by experts to be of Russian origin, have been placed on the English market with the result that diamonds have fallen from  35 a carat to  18 a carat.   They are being disposed of in packets valued at  30,000 each and some of them are believed to be now at Edgar Lansbury^ house.   Others have been offered for sale in the North of England, the only stipulation beins* that payments shall be made in French notes, which bear no numbers and there-fore cannot be traced.   If this is true - and steps are beingtaken/
taken to verify it - the large suras of money which are being disbursed by revolutionary organisations con be ClfCSJj accounted for.   It points for the urgent need of Ilegislation making it ah offence to introduce or receivj, money from abroad for the purpose of revolutionary propaganda.   It is worth mentioning that this week a    i British subject named Leslie, who declared himself to bj a Bolshevik and was donorted to this country by the Nob Authorities, landed with  90 in English notes, for which he declined to account.SINK gEIN U GREAT BBITAIMThe death of Hie Lord Mayor of Cork has overshadowed all else in Sinn Fein circles but the activity is perhaps best described in the words of my Yorkshire corresponded) who writes that there has been &quot;a glut of rosary recitatji and religious services.&quot;   Tbe procession in London appeal to have a good effect on the spectators who were amaaed si the repulsive types forming the cortege.   There has been j practically no disorder in this country, and although theI threat of reprisals cannot be discounted there is evidenci of nervousness lest they should recoil upon the Sinn Fein11 movement.It is estimated that some 40,000 people took part in the Manchester procession; a hearse containing a coffin was draped with republican colours and several men wore t, unfform of the Irish volunteers.   At Liverpool a service held in front of an open grave, but although- the processio of 12,000 was jeered at by spectators, no disorder occurre In Newcastle the demonstrators, who numbered between 3,000 and 4,000, also followed &quot;a coffin,   R, Purcell, who presg at an enthusiastic mooting, is active in this district.About/
About 4,000 people-attended the Bradford demonstration..    On Ootober 29th some 2,000 people were present at , a patriotic-Orange mooting in Bootlo and unanimously passed a resolution condemning; Sinn :?ein.Hanna, the president of the Belfast Boilermakers Society, and C-reensbor, a&apos; Belfast Jew, are active in -South Wales on behalf of the expelled Sinn ?ein workmen. They are addressing meetings and approaching trade unions for financial assistance.There Is a.report, not &quot;yet confirmed, that drilling and rifle exercise is carried on at the Irish Club in Coventry,Four Sinn Seiners have been arrested as a result of the shooting outrage at Bothwell,   It is not unlikely, however, that the &quot;Bed Guard&quot; was implicated and it is ... , , thought that the incident arose through an attempt to raid the Brill Hall-.   Rumours of reprisals for the death of MacSwiney are still current in the Glasgow area.There is evidence that the Irish Labour representatives, who.1 recently came:to London to&apos;- confer with the English Labour ,;Vt, leaders, have attempted to Get into touch with Erassin. .   The immediate object is apparently to open trade with Russia . through.the medium of-the Co-operative Societies.   There , appears to be friction between the Irish Commtinist party and the Liberty Hall ;,roup.IRELANDPractically the whole country with the exception of North.East Ulster continued in a disturbed and restless state. Although the total number of outrages reported  again  shows a slight decrease the state of affairs is extremely bad andmurder/
murder is a matter of daily occurrence.   There is little regard for life or property.   In all 213 outrages wereitreported.   Of these 143 were directly attributable to SindjFein and Included five cases of murder of civilians inaddition to murders of police.   The week-end coinciding wiMaoSwiney&apos;8 funeral was an extremely, bad one.   DistrictInspector Kelleher was murdered in his hotel in Granard,Co. Longford, two police were murdered at  illorglin,Co. Kerry, two in Tipperary and Littletown     R.I.C. barrain the some county were attacked and burned to the ground.)11 outrages were due to agrarian motives and the remaining59 were grave crimes of a non-political character and thesincluded five more oases of murder.Three vacated police barracks and one-courthouse were!Imaliciously burned. The mail was held up and robbed on ovl thirty occasions.Police and military were active and a large number of I searches, ^seizures of arms and seditious literature as well as of arrests were made.The Sinn Fein papers appeared as usual and devoted a good deal of space to eulogies of the late Lord Mayor though &quot;Young Ireland&quot; was the only one of the principal papers of this class to appear with mourning columns.   It contains an article by M.M., presumably Michael MacWhite, entitled &quot;France and Ireland&quot; dealing with the alleged rece demonstration in Paris against British atrocities in IrelanThe Labour situation remains unchanged and the railway struggle still continues. Recent returns show some increas in the strength of the Irish Transport and General Workers-Union. A keen watch is beins; &amp;6P&quot;t affairs in England . in the hope of turning them to advantage.
APPENDIXRED   OFFICER   COURSEPREFACEThis little &quot;book is intended to be a guide for teaohers of R.O.C. Classes.     (R.O.C. s Red Officer Course)...The Course can be completed in 9 instructions of from two to three hours duration each.   If this is spread over a period of 8 or 9 weeks (including two lectures for revision and examination) and thereby allowing time for private study at home, intelligent cadets should have a fair general knowledge at the end of the CourBe.     In the Imperial Army this course on an even less comprehensive scale, would occupy from 6 to 9 months.     In view of the uncertainty of the time of the revolutionary crisis, it is thought better to have a comprehensive course capable of repetition rather than a long course liable to interruption...Training in signalling, Morse, Semaphore, etc, should be given *ell through the course, allowing about 15 minutes in each leoture for this...We put this book into your hand, comrades.    Use it to the best advantage in our fight against the capitalist class. It is a weapon wrested from the hands of the bourgeois-militarists.We are soldiers of the International Red Army, that Army of Proletarians and Workers led by the Communists, who fight or soon will fight in every country over the five continents of the ILarth.    We shall not lay down our arms before the world is ours, before the dark night of oppression and the bloodred, stormy dawn of Revolution have changed it into the glorious day of Freedom and Communism.SiA grim struggle lies before us on our section of the International front.Down with our enemies, the Churchills, the Capitalists, the Imperialists and all their lackeys 1Long live the Red Army&apos;.SYLLABUSOutlines of Course.

We have to conquer that, otherwise exploitation, ,misery and imperialistic wars will be perpetuated.    To pretend anything else is to be a fool or a traitor, who deceives the working class and prolongs its sufferings.    We have gone far beyond the silly cries about &quot;bloodshed1 of short-sighted hesitators...Every year of continued slavery in this merry, capitalist England costs so much in suffering and blood, in destruction^ of human lives of present and unborn generations as to justify the bloodiest of revolutions.    We uiow that as long as the bourgeois militarism prevails, no fundamental change for the better will be possible - and even if it were possible, say, through ??arllament, etc., to introducecommunism/Machine Gun Drill.

communism find internationalism, it would be impossible to maintain it when the capitalists command the whole, or even a part, of the armed force.     It is obvious that they would use the first opportunity to seize power again, destroy all the results of a peaceful1 revolution and, raging after their first defeat, instigate a hellish White Terror like that which has occurred in parts of Russia, in Hungary and Finland and after the Commune of 1871 in Paris.    Ho;   we must be able to &quot;out an iron-strong Proletarian militarism1 against the bourgeois militarism.   Complete disarmament of the capitalist and bourgeois class, and arming ourselves - that is the only guarantee for the success of the Revolution and of Communism. Only when the hard, transition period is over, and the class state has been transformed into the class-less working community will all militarism and all arms disappear.But before that we shall have a long and terrific struggle. We must now prepare for that struggle.   To show how this is to be done and to help every communist to the necessary knowledge - that is what this Course is out for.Object of the Course.,.The object of the R.O.C, is to train a number of men into conscious communists, and to give them sufficient knowledge about the different sides of military v/ork, in order that they may be able, in the near future, to carry out the duties of (1). Organisers of the British Red Army, (2) Officers of the British Bed Army, (r6) Communist-Military Commissaries to control non-communist technical officers and staff which may be employed by the Revolutionary Authority.The body of thus trained communists must be entirely at the disposal of a certain Communist Revolutionary Authority atthe time of an actual revolution and when the order for the mobilisation of the Red Army is issued.   Who thut authority will be cannot here be defined.For the present, the work must be carried out &quot;Underground&apos; and under strict secrecy, but it is also of absolute importance that this body of Red Army Leaders does not regard itself as an independent, fighting, terroristic or similar organisation. It is not a body of ^plotters1 or 1riotmakers&apos;, but of future Red Army leaders and officers, who act closely and loyally in line with the Communist Mass Movement.It is perhaps necessary particularly to.lay stress on the fact that the object of the R.O.C., for the present time, is not to train a Red Army, but to train officers, organisers and instructors for it.    The organisation of the masses cannot be done secretly.    The preliminary work for that is being done, consciously or unconsciously, by the ex-Service M9n&apos;s Unions,    As individuals we can guide and participate in that, but directly it is not the concern of the R.O.C..,,We must be calm and stubborn In our preparations, &amp;nd keep our minds well directed towards the big&quot;, final goal, and coming social hurricane on the back of which we are going to ride and the reins of which we must be able to handle.     Then we shall make our move with accumulated strength which shall not have been spoiled by wavering end side-tracking...Some comrades, quite In earnest and keen on the job, may have doubts as to the possibility of getting anything really efficient done compared with the Regulor Army, when we have towork/
work in suoli difficult conditions.    Well, it IS difficult, but! it is not hopeless by any means, if we consider the following A points.     (l) &quot;Oho efficiency and discipline of the Regular Army oan be practically broken by propaganda, end parts cf it may come over on our side.    (Z) We shall have to fight, mainly against people who are more or less trained and organised like ourselves, viz: bourgeois white-guards.     They may have more skilled officers, but it is up to us to show that they have less morale, less determination, less endurance, (3) The revolutionary civil war will, at any rate in the beginning, have largely the character of improvised guerilla warfare, street-fighting and so on.    Although we must be prepared to meet tanks, aircraft, flame-throwing and gas even here, it will not be quite the same as the gigantic, skilful murder engineering of the imperialist war.     (4) In the ti,;e shortly after the revolution which may have been comparatively! bloodless in its first stage, even the raere existence of a Communist Red Army and its armed demonstrations in the streetsj may be enough to impose the will of the revolutionary proletariat and keep down counter-revolutionary aggressivenessl (5)   In a revolutionary v/ar, more depends on the high personal quality and spirit of each fighter than on the technical equipment.Standing OrdersThe Cadets of the R.O.C. are subject to the following standing rules:Precautionary1.    The Cadets must never speak about this Course, or about persons connected with &quot;it, directly or indirectly, not even with fellow comrades outside the class.Books and capers and notes must not be left lying about . They must be destroyed if there is danger of their fallinf into the hands of unauthorised persons. In the event of any Cadet being arrested by the enemy, bef must sacrifice himself rather than his organisation,3.    The Cadets of a Course must not enquire, or try to obtain] otherwise, information about things that do not concern them directly.    They will be told everything that is necessary in the class.    TRUST and you will be TRUSTED.4.    Cadets must not frequent Public Rouses^5.    Persons who act as provocateurs or who with malicious intent betray their comrades, this Course and its organisation, may be punished with death...Oath to be taken by the Red Army on Enlistment and Renewed on l.lay Day of each year.Before the working classes of Great Britain and of the whole world I 3wear to bear my calling honourably and to perform my training conscientiously.I swear straightly and unflinchingly to observe revolutionary discipline, and unhesitatingly to obey all the orders of the commanders appointed      the revolutionary authorities.
I swear to abBtain myself and withhold my comrades from all actions lowering to the d.ignity of a revolutionary communist, to direct all my actions and thoughts towards the great aim of the liberation of all the workers.I swear at the first call of the revolutionary authorities to take up the duties for which I shall have been specially trained, and in the battle for the British Soviet Republic, for the work of Socialism and the brotherhood of the peoples, to spare neither my energies nor my life itself,If by malioious intent I break this my solemn promise, then my universal contempt &quot;be my lot, and Hay I be punished by the stern hand of the revolutionary law...LECTURE VStaff: Requirements - Organisation..... When a revolutionary situation has arisen, the mobilisation of the R$d Army may be brought about by various means.If possible, the order will be sent out from the Central Revolutionary Authority and the trained officers will be called together and the situation explained to them, or again, the situation may develop in such a manner that no communication is possible, in which case &quot;Mobilisation&quot; must he brought about by the initiative of Officers in their localities.But however the    question of mobilisation has been brought about, the procedure should be as uniform as possible.Pirst call a mass meeting of workers; probably under the revolutionary situation existing there will be many meetings proceeding; these can of course be utilised.Either tako the chair, or by tact and push obtain a hearing, explain the necessity immediately of organising the Red Guards to protect Labour interests, preserve order and stamp down counter-revolutionary activities.Call for volunteers, tell off&quot; suitable persons as your second in command, Secretary and Messenger. , Probably you will have earmarked these before the revolution, and so assured yourself of trusty Communists, although it would not have been necessary to do more than sound them as to their views.Pick out the Ex-Service Men and earmark the specialists, i.e. fl.C.0s, or Corporals, Signallers, Engineers, etc.    Pick out as many suitable leaders as you know of.0&apos;rganise the men up into companies of not more than 200 men or less than 100 men, thus, if you have any number up to 200 only form one Company, any number between 200 and 400, two Companies.Make/
Make the men fall into two ranks or four, if space jLsj limited. ,Sub-divide each Company into a platoons, allocate ^2 leaders to each plateau , if necessary each platoon can be divided into 2 sections,   Distribute the ex-service menj but remember that it is mere important to have communists evenly distributed than ex-service men, for the Army is to I be a political Army of communists.   Hunt out the anti-socialists,Tell off specialists as follows:-Signallers Messengers Transport Commissariat Machine Gunners Rod Cross...Provide all men with arms and ammunition; if no instructions are received from headquarters, use your discretion as to whether any known depots&apos;or gunsmiths should, be raided.    In any case, weapons should be improvised.Decide on your local headquarters, Post sentries, have password if necessary, iDocile on barracks for the men, a public building, school, church, Tov/n Hall,. Library, large private house, store, etc, would be suitable, taken by force if necessary, much better to keep the men than allow them to] go home...When taking over food supplies, a requisition note must be given for same, this requisition note to be signej by a Had&quot;Army Laader.   Tho requisition note will, of cowl be to the store keeper a receipt for the goods taken by tj Rod Army.Select ammunition magazine, post guards as necessarjPut out scouts and get into touoh with adjoining Companies, also ascertain  movements of &quot;White&quot; forces ii\ -locality.Arrest and detain known or suspected reactionary conspirators.Report in code to headquarters the strength of yotJ Company or Companies. Arms available, and report the loof situation.Preserve order in your district, prevent looting, particular attention to Brnks, Telegraph Stations, Telephone Exchanges, etc., occupy if necessary.The question of occupying factories will probably the first question to be considered.Prepare barricades as necessary to protect the fa or other localities...lecture/
Barricades... Usvo/Lly time will not permit of erecting a &quot;Drill Book&quot; &quot;barricade, and it must be improvised.Overturned 1 buses, trams, carts, form a good framework for a barricade.If not available, procure either bales of cloth, rolls of paper In vicinity of newspaper offices, scaffolding poles, timber, telegraph poles, lamp-posts, shop shutters, heavy furniture.Barricades can be &quot;armoured1 by mattresses, pillows, light furniture, paving stones, etc..LECTURE VIIDefence of a FactoryOn taking over a factory, first of all tighten up walls, strengthen weak places, barricade gates, select central &quot;keep&quot; for final stand, select shelters for occupying troops whilst being shelled, mount machine guns (well hidden) to command all approaches (rifles if no machine guns available), barricade approaches; if sufficient number of men and arms available, put out outposts to oommand approaches.Establish means of vlsxi&amp;l signalling with nearest Red Centre.Requisition, if possible^ sufficient food for 3 weeks...When factory fortifications are complete and if no opposition occurs, construct inner and outer row of defences.   (Employ local civilians for your work).You will then have following defences which enemy must surmount before you surrender:-lf Outer defenoe. About i to 1 mile from Factory. 2.   Inner defences    Immediate vicinity of factory,probably 100 to 200 yards.3.   Factory walls. 4.   Keep.If the factory produces essentials, work it and exchange or barter goods if opportunity presents itself.This procedure applies to defence of Food Stores in docks, Flour Mills, etc, but attack from seaward must be watohea for.Hold up all traffic in neighbourhood, alloy/ ample supplies to pass or requisition as necessary.Settle down and organise a Factory Staff on the routine lines you have been told,..If it is considered necessary to keep the factory working, because of its importance to ourselves, or if only a limited number of trusted revolutionaries are available to carry out the duties of the armed force, we may conscript the civil population for building barricades or for doingauxiliary/LECTURE VI
auxiliary work insido the factory, etc.   The non-combatant population is likely to he more or less idle during the most critioal time...Defence of a Mine d... The defence of mines differs from the defence of factories5 therefore, in that the defence must in the first instance be tii defence of an area, probably many square miles.Groups of mines - valleys in South Wales - should therefore co-ordinate their arrangements.   .Many areas are extremely vulnerable from a blockade toy Churchill.   Especially is this so in the enclosed Welsh Yalleyg with one road and single line.   These approaches must therefore he guarded and held. .Many mining areas contain only a hare 2 or 3 days&apos; food supply.   It is obvious that their ability to hold out in the event of a blockade will depend materially on the co-operation which they can get from the large centres.Durham and Northumberland Coal Field from Newcastle, Middlesbro1, Hartlepool, etc.Welsh Coal Valleys from the Ports of Cardiff, Port Talhot and Swansea, where there are extensive Flour Mills.Leaders of the Party should not overlook any method of preparation with comrades in these localities.The surrounding hills must also he defended.   They can best be held by a series of Blockhouses.   Natural positions, refuse and shale dumps, woods, can all be adapted.Seizure of a BankEvict occupants.   Locate bullion.   Every entrance seal.In big towns .If a central branch, prepare for defence, strengthen windows and doors (vide &quot;Manual of Field Engineering&quot;, Plate 23).Await instructions from Central Revolutionary Authority. Post OfficeRemove essential parts.   Cut wires.Confer with Revolutionary Authorities, if possible. Telephone Exchange /VStop linking entirely.LinesCut- m i ^mim&amp;^MmM si
