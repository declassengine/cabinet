This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government,   4 51)SECRET. jNf       3THE CABINET.REFUGEES IN MESOPOTAMIA.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.I circulate for the information of my colleagues a Memorandum showing the present     121 situation of the Assyrian and Armenian Refugees in Mesopotamia in continuation of     3 my Memorandum of the 13th June last (CP. 1463).   I am convinced that we shall    1881 never get effective handling of this question, or escape the indefinite continuance of heavy expenditure, so long as the Department controlling the policy is not responsible for paying the cost.   I must again emphasize the fact that the expenditure on these people is in no sense an Army service, and is governed by political considerations which lie outside the purview of this Department.   It is not right that the War Office should have to take a large supplementary estimate for this purpose.-  - - W. S.-.C.7The War Office.9th November, 1920.At a Cabinet meeting on the 30th June last (Cabinet 38 (20J Conclusion^)) it was decided that the Secretary of State for India should send instructions to the local Administration in Mesopotamia that the repatriation of these refugees was to be expedited to the utmost possible extent. The following statement shows what little progress it has been possible to make since that date towards getting these people oft our hands, and how the liability of Army Funds, which it was originally intended to limit to the sum provided in Army Estimates ( 643,000), is in a fair way to reach  1,830,000 for this financial year alone.(i.) Assyrians. The concentration of the Assyrians from Baqubah camp in the Mosul area has been completed, but the refugees have been unwilling to proceed through hostile Kurkish territory to their new home until they were adequately armed with guns and rifles. As His Majesty&apos;s Government could not honourably turn them out insufficiently armed, certain mountain guns for which they asked were promised them early in July, and some of these reached them some time ago. It was further arranged that the Lady Surma Khanum, an influential Assyrian lady, whose arrival was expected to have some effect in inducing them to move, should reach Mesopotamia in the course of October.Since the promise of the guns was made, two reports have been received from the Civil Commissioner, Baghdad. The first, at the end of August, was to the effect that in spite of every effort put forward locally to accelerate repatriation., it might not be possible in view of the disturbed condition of affairs in Mesopotamia to get the refugees through the passes into their new home before winter had set in, though they would be in a favourable position to make a forward move in spring. The second, dated 18th October, was slightly more hopeful in tone;; it stated that arrangements were in train, that the forward movement of the first portion had commenced and that it was expected to be complete before winter. It is not known what proportion this first contingent may bear to the whole, but, with winter so near at hand, it would only be reasonable to suppose that the great majority of these refugees must be maintained in the Mosul Yilayet at the expense of the Imperial funds until at least the end of next March, instead of to the end of&apos; October only, as was hoped when the matter was last before the Cabinet.It appears that the French Government are now interesting themselves in these Assyrian refugees. It is hoped that their disposal will not he still further postponed by diplomatic correspondence with the French Government.(ii.) The Armenians have in the past few weeks been brought down to Basrah with a view to their possible repatriation by sea.   Various proposals have been made(B20/450)   100  11/20  H&amp;S, Ltd  8697wo   &apos;
for their repatriation by sea or land, or alternatively for their settlement in Mesopotamia, but hitherto the Foreign Office has found that racial or political difficulties prevent the acceptance of any of the solutions suggested. The latest proposal to repatriate them to Erivan by sea was stated by the Foreign Office to be impossible in view of the famine conditions prevailing in that area.In a telegram of 8th October to the Foreign Office, however, His Majesty&apos;s High Commissioner at Constantinople stated that in a recent interview a representative of the Armenian Government had expressed the willingness of his country to receive the refugees now at Basrah provided that the British Government assisted in the supply of fuel necessary for the Armenian railways now that their supplies had been cut off by Azerbaidjan. It is not known whether this offer bore the.express authority of the Armenian Government, but an endeavour is being made to ascertain this. In the meantime they are reported to be costing some  60,000 a month.An interdepartmental conference is now being arranged with a view to arriving at some agreed policy.(iii.) Additional refugees. It appears that there is at least one other body of refugees in Mesopotamia, consisting of 1,300 Assyrians and Armenians hitherto supported by the Lord Mayor&apos;s Fund, which has notified its inability to continue. It is possible that this responsibility will now be undertaken by the American Mission, failing which, Army Estimates will no doubt be expected to take up this fresh burden.On the assumption that all these refugees remain on our hands till 31st March next, the total cost during the present financial year is estimated at not less than  1,830,000 or nearly  1,200,000 more than the amount provided in Army Estimates.
