IHTFRNATIONAL LABOUR OiATCL,Memorandum by the Secretary to the Cabinet.The attached cony of a letter from Sir Malcolm Delevingne, the British representative on the Governing Body of the International Labour Office, is circulated for the information of the Cabinet,Attention is directed particularly to the following passages:-Paragraph 2,     Ratification by the British Government of the Conventions agreed to at the Washington International Labour Conference -Paragraph 3,    The effective representation of British employers -Paragraph 4.    Finance * Instructions to the british representative in regard to the Estimates for 1921,Paragraph 7*     The selection of the President for the Conference of 1921,Paragraph 11.     The issue by Government Departments to the international Labour Office of reports and official publications on questions affecting labour.Paragraph 12, .   The formation of a special inter-departmental organisation to keep in touch with the International Labour Office0Decisions of the Cabinet are required in respect of paragraphs 7 and 12,     Paragraph 12 raises incidentally thequestion which Department shall be the channel of communi-cation between the International Labour Bureau and theBritish Government,The.choice appears to lie between the Department ofthe British Representative on the Labour Bureau, who mighthave a -special branch for this work; the Ministry of Labourand the Cabinet Secretariat.,   The latter has been actingprovisionally,hut the work is increasing and requires more attention than can be given by the e-isting staff.   there appears much to he said for concentrating the work i n the
Ministry of Labour, which is &quot;&quot;tore concerned t)Department.The question is submitted for decision.(Blroied) K*P9A*Hankey2, &quot;&quot;hitehall Gardens, S/-U; October 28th, 1920,
fttiolnL:ttre to fl.P.g*83.Oopv of letter ^rom Sir Kluloolm rMtljvingn:.- to th^HOME oyFIOB,8*9.1*19th October, 1920. ear Sir Maurice Hankoy,I have just returned from tho first mooting of theiGoverning Body of tho International Labour Of floe at Geneva, and aa the Office Is now established there in aooordanco with tho Treaty, and its organisation has taken a definite shape, I think it may be useful for mo to submit far the information of the Government, some notes en the organisation of the Office and the. work whioh is being done.1.     The Office which is provided for by the Treaty of Peace as part of the International Labour %rganisation did nut come into being until after  he first International Labour Conference at Washington last November *t which the Constitution of the .Governing Body of the Office was completed.     Tho Governing Body met at Paris in January to make arrangements for the institution of the Office.    M. Albert Thonas, formerly Minister cf Munitions in France, was appointed Director of the Office, and Mr. H.B.Butler, C.B.i of the British Civil Service was at once appointed by M. Thomas as Deputy Director.    Mr. Butler had had considerable $xporlonco of labour questions in tho Industrial Division of the Home Office and afterwards as Assistant Secretary at the Ministry of Labour; and had also acted as one of the Secretaries to the Labour Commission e-f the Peace Conference, as Secretary to&apos; the Organising Committee of the Washington Conference, and as General Secretary of that Conforanco.     Tho Office was in tho first instenoe provisionally established in London (whore the Secretariat of the League of Nations was also temporarily/(Thore have been four previous meetings at Washington, Paris, London and Genoa).
temporarily settled), but was moved to its permanent scat at Geneva in Juno,   A large building about a mile outside tho town has boon secured on a threo years1 lease, with option of purchase, on terms which are moderate in view of the present prices at Geneva, where the cost of everything is becoming very hoavy.   An international staff has boon g?t together, not without difficulty.   Tho Director has been bombarded w:.th. applications, and subjected to a groat deal of pressure; men of the right kind have been difficult to find, and the removal to Gonova, which service in tho Office entails * has prevented some very competent persons from accepting posts.   The English and French elements, almost of necessity, predominate, but important poets are also held by men from tho United States, Italy, Canada, Belgium and other countries,    There are some weak spots and some means may have to be found of strengthening tho Director1s hands against, pressure from particular countries or particular interests.-     Tho English staff includes several civil servants who have boon seconded from thoir Offices, and is taking an important part in tho work.     It will.be further strengthened next month; several administrative posts are being offered and it is proposed to hold an e .amination for thorn in London, with the assistance (it is hoped) cf tho Civil oervico Oommissionors..   A system of examination is being introduced for all grades of the staff.   The staff including all ranks now numbers about 180*   &apos;The organisation of the Office has also presented difficulties.     The director brought with him.ideas cf organisation based on the methods of French Ministries, and the leputy Director and the E%lish official element associated with him have contributed ideas based on the English system of administration.. The result has been an amalgam ox tho two systems.   I attach a diagram showing the present constitution of the Office. There has been someoonfusicn
and overlapping both between tho administrative departments and tho Cabinet on the one side and. between the departments and tho technical soetiono whose position how not yet boon clearly dofinad on the other, and tho arrangement cannot be permanent in the present form; but tho organisation has boon stoadily improving, and with tho groat increase in the amount of work, tho English methods are, I think, bound finally to prevail.    The Cabinet will become a pifcrato secretariat end tho taohnical sections will bo subordinated to the administrative departments.The relations of the Director and Deputy Director aro, I believe, very good, and the combination of the two is perhaps as good as any that could, have been got.   M, Thomas is a man of tremendous, energy and great personal influence   Mri ButlorTe administrative e-perionce and knowledge of labour questions have boon of great value in organising tho office and its work, My own relations with the Director have been particularly friendly.. He takes a very largo view of the functions and mission of the Office and is determined to make it a real force.   There is a danger on tho other hand that he may attempt more than the Office is able or fitted to undertake.M, Millerand recently paid a visit to the Office,   It would be very desirable that a similar crislt ehould be made by the Prime Minister if the opportunity pit.    -s itself.   Perhaps Mr. Balfour, who you will remember had some hand in&apos; the shaping of Part XIII of tho Treaty, would also pay a visit to tho Office when ho attends the mooting of tho Assembly of the League next months2.     The work of the Office up to tho present has boon concerned mainly with (a) the business consequent on tho Washington Conference (b) the preparation and holding of tho Gonea Conference(on
(on oeamo:.ifo employment) last June, and tho business arising out of it; (c) special inquiries) (dj tho collection and circulation of information on labour natters.Tho Director has been busy pros sing ratification of tho &quot;ashington Conventions on tho different Governments and has visited many of tin- Euronoan capitals and interviewed Ministers, pith that object *     That there is not very much yet to show in -one shape of actual ratification is not&apos; duo to any slackness on tho part of the Office,     A number of questions have arisen on the Conventions and on the Treaty (as to the moaning or effect of tho Conventions, tho procedure for ratification, whether it is possible to ratify with reservations and so on), which have boon dealt with by the Office in consultation with the legal advisors .of the League of /latlons.It is of the greatest importance for the success of the Industrial Labour Organisation that ratification should proceed as rapidly as possible *     Violent attacks are being made by tho extreme elements of labour on the Organisation and on the labour loaders who giY&amp; it their support, eg. at the recent mooting of tho French C.G.T. at Orleans.     Failure or delay to ratify the Conventions - at any rato trie more important of them and particularly tho Convention on the tight hours Lay - will shake the confidence of labour in the Organisation, weaken tho hands of the more moderate loaders, and strengthen tho extreme sections. There are already signs of reaction against tho \ashington Conventions in some countries (eg. in Switzerland       whore the action of tho Director in pressing ratification has boon severely criticized in the press and by the Swiss employers1 representative at our recent meeting; in Prance difficulties arc being raised in official circles in re ard to the procedure for ratificationlaid/
laid down in the Treaty etc. etc.) - and tho workers arc watching the action of tho government in regard to the Conventions.     It would have a very good effect if Groat Britain were able to ratify some, at any rate, of the Conventions, especially tho Fight Hours Convention, before the end of the year;Tho most important inquiries undertaken up to thepresent aro(1) the inquiry into Emigration, directed by tho Vfashington Conference on tho proposal of tho Italians. - An International Committee, of which Lord Cave Id President, has house:1 appointed for the purpose;(2) the inquiries into the industrial conditions iw Russia and Hungary, initiated by tho C-ovornin-g Body;(3) the inquiry into the factors affecting industrial production at the present time, initiated by the Governing Body on a proposal from the employers1 representatives supported by tho workers.A valuable preliminary volume has already been issued by the   Office on the industrial conditions in Russia which has been favourably reviewed both in this country and America, and may help to remove the impression in the United states that the Labour Conference and Office are a &quot;red&quot; Organisation.     The Soviet Government refused to allow a mission from the Office to enter tho country for the purpose cf waking investigations on the spot but in spite of this the Office has been ablo to continue the inquiry and has collected much further material which will shortly be published.     A report on conditions in rungary is about to appear.     The other inquiries mentioned are only in the early stages.The arrangements for the collection and distribution , of information which is iwo of tho most important functions of the Office, are making progress, but have not yot been completed. A special division of tho Office has been constituted and Dr.)lockerof/
of the United l/tatcn ministry of Labour haa been placed in char30 of it and has just taken up tho work.    Kin appointment nan received with favour in the United   tatoa*     A eeries of publications io contemplated, including a weekly bulletin of information on the work of the Organisation etc,, a monthly review of a scientific and technical character on industrial questions and a series of pamphlets on special subjects,       ho first numbers of the bulletin, and pamphlets have already boon issued.     The chief industrial laws of tho different countries are also to bo issued in several languages,&apos; in continuation of tho work of the old &quot;International Association for the legal protection of Labour&quot;, and the valuable library of that Association has boon acquired.     This division of the Office will do centrally much work which is at present done independently in different countries, and to,that extent will be able to&quot; re1i0vc the Govornmonts,The Office is already receiving a large number of requests for information on industrial questions from Governments, trade organisations otc*It is too soon yet to judge tho Office by the visiblo results of its work, but I think, considering all the difficulties encountered, there is no reason for dissatisfaction,3,   The Governing &quot;oily has worked on the whole harmoniously The-employers group usually act together, and tho workers group do the same.   In tho employers group, Trench influence seems to predominate.     The British employers &apos; representative, f!ir Allan Smith, has unfortunately only attended at 0:10 of the four meetings so far held, and British employers are not. exercising much influence In consequence on the development and work of the Office,     This apathy on the part of tho employers is dlsapnointing.     It is very  1 much, to be desired that the views of British employers, which are not by any means always the same as those of the other countries-   represented/
represented, should he effectively represented on the Governing Body, but this is impossible without continuity of representation. A real grasp, of the work of the office cannot bo obtained if the representative is varied from meeting to meeting.   In the workers group the lead is taken by M. Jouhaux, the French representative.   Mr. Stuart Running, the representative of the British workers, has not done very much.   I understand he is resigning his post.The members of the Government group set independently but on questions of real importance there has been no serious division of opinion.The minutes of the proceedings at the meetings of the Governing Body wil&apos;! in future be circulated officially to each Government which is a member of the International Labour Organisetion.Strong complaints were mr.de at the Washington Conference by some of th&quot; Non-European countries of the predominance of European Countries on the Governing body, and in accordance with a resolution adopted by the Conference, the question of the constitution of the Governing Body is being considered by a Committee, of which I am one of the members.   Various proposals have been put forward for the alteration ov&apos; the constitution of the Governing Body as settled by the Treaty, including a proposal for o considerable enlargement of its number-.   I have opposed a &quot;y proposal being m?.:de for an alteration of the Treaty at the present time, and I think the general feeling is against that course.   The Committee will settle Its report in time t   be considered by th. Governing Body at its meeting in January.4.     The exp rises of the Of Lice were estimated for the first year - April 1920 to March 1921 - at  250,000, but this included a considerable sum in the nature of capital expenditure. In future the financial year will be the calendar year, and theestimate
estimate for 1921 is now being prepared.   Allowing for theloss of exchange, it will probably amount to between  350,000and  375,000 - and the sum of 7,000,000 gold francs hps been provisionally given to the Secretariat of the League in replyto their request for a figure to be inserted in the budget tobe submitted to the Assembly in November,   The estimates areprepared by the Office, and submitted to and closely scrutinisedby a finance Committee appointed by the Governing Body,   &apos;%emembers of this Committee are the President (M, Fontaine), M*Carlier (Belgian employer), M. Jouhaux (French worker) and myself,the Director and Deputy Director attend its meetings.   Thesum proposed for 1921 is considerable, but not 1 think excessive.It includes some capital expenditure   necessarily carried over -from the previous estimate (1920-21) as ft result of the changein the financial year, and the cost of the annual conference,but the bulk is in respect of the current work of the Office,The main items of        expenditure for the 9 months to 51st december next are as follows (estimated):*Salaries  75,000 Rent etc, 3,500 Printing 11,000 Travellingl6;500 Stationery 5,500 Library 5,000 Correspon-dents etc9,000The salaries paid are in the main based on the standards set by the Secretariat of the league, and pre net extravagant when compared with the salaries (including war bonus) now being paid in England,&quot;, and taking into account the higher cost of living in Geneva, and the fact of the employment being in a foreign country, There is in fact a considerable amount of.dissatisfaction amongIthe intermediate and lower grades of the staff who complain that they cannot live on the salaries fixed by the Governing body. Travelling expenses form a considerable item,   The Office is not responsible for the travtlling expenses and allowances of the Government members of the Governing Body but it is
is responsible for those of the 12 non-official members and of the members of the Committee and Commissions, find in the case ofnon-European members these are very heavy.   This cannot be avoided.A substantial saving would be effected if it could be arranged that the postal matter sent cut from the Office could&apos; be franked internationally.   Under the present postal arrangements the whole of the sum paid for postage goes to the S-wiss Government, while the cost is borne by all the members of the Organisation. In view of the circumstances in which the Office has been established at Geneva, this does not&apos; seem a fair arrangement. It has been suggested that the question might be considered at the International Postal Congress now sitting at Eadrld. Incident&quot; ally if the &quot;frank&quot; could take the form of an international &quot;Labour&quot; stamp, it might prove a useful means cf giving publicity to the Labour Organisation.Some question uas raised at the meeting of the Councilof the League at Gan Sebastian as to the cost of the LabourOffice, but the Council decided that it had no control over thedecisions of the Budget Committee of the Labour Office or the totalestimate for the budget and that it Is the duty of each Governmentto give to its representative on the Governtrj;   Body any Instructionsit may deem necessary.Having regard to the subjects for which the InternationalLabour organisation was created, and the present situation In theworld of Labour, it cannot be said that the sum proposed is a heavyone for the members of the League to pay.The equalisation of labour conditions as between thei;: also a v.,luOlo -.3dot to the -dv!.noed oountrioj.various countries/ The improvements tc which Japan, for instance, pledge herself at Washington in regard to hours of work, employment of women and children etc. will help the &quot;British manufacturer to compete on more level terms with Japan in the Eastern markets.A\
A system for the examination and checking *f expenditure has been instituted in the Office, which appears to be effective, ^and financial regulations are in preparation.I have proposed that the detailed estimate for 1921 when passed by the Governing  Body at its meeting in January should he published in the some form and with the same detail as an English estimate.5.     A difficult question has arisen with regard to the preparation of the reports on the agenda of the Annual Conference. The duty of examining the subjects which it is proposed to bring before the Conference with a view to the conclusion of International Conventions, is placed upon the International Lab our Office by Article 396 of the Treaty.   In the case of the Washington and Genoa Conferences, the&quot;procedure adopted was to circulate a full questionnaire on each of the subjects included in tho agenda to the Governments belonging to the Or organisation with a view to obtaining full information in regard both to the existing position in each country and the attitude of the Government towards the particular proposals under considera-tion, e.g, the eight hours day, prohibition of employment of women at night, etc,     The information when received was digested into a report and a draft Convention on the basis of the replies received, was prepared-     IIfor the,consideration of the Conference.   In the case of the Washington Conference this procedure worked satisfactorily; all the questions for consideration had already been the subject.of jnuch consideration and discussion in the chief 4 idustrial countries, and a great deal of information was available with Regard to them,     The Organising Committee which was entrusted under the Treaty with the preparations for the Conference consisted of official representatives of a few of the most important countries fk and they were able to agree without difficulty on the reports and the form of the draft Convent-ons to be submitted to the Conference,The.
The reports and draft Conventions proved to be a satisfactory working basis for the discussions In the Conference.     In the case of the Genoa Conference the procedure more or less failed, at any rate as regards the chief subject under discussion, viz: the limitation of hours of employment of seamen.     This subject had not previously been so fully considered and the policy of some Governments, including cur own, was not definitely settled^     The replies from the Governments - were also very late in reaching the International Labour Office.     Tho result was that the reports and draft Conventions for the consideration of the Conference had to be settled by the Director himself and were never seen by members of tho Governing Body and were In fact njt Issued till the Conference was on the point of meeting,     Further, the draft Conventions prepared by him were not on the lines which the British or a number of other .Governments could approve and their form gave rise to considerable practical difficulties at the Conference *    Two consequences followed, both cf which militated against the success of the Conference.     In the first place as no delegate in the Conference was in any way responsible for the reports or draft Conventions thero was no one to take charge of them, as a Minister takes charge of a Bill for which his department is responsible $ and to explain and defend them.     The result was that the Director himself, as the author of the proposals, was drawn in to take part in the proceedings with, results which were not altogether fortunate.     It is very desirable that this ahouldbe avoided in future, as It is clearly incompatible with hisposition as Secretary General of the Conference that he shouldtake part in the actual consideration and discussion of the subjectbefore the Conference,     M, Thomas himself feels that the present procedure is.defective and he has proposed to the Governing Bodythat in future tho questionnaire issued to the Governments shouldbe lightened, that the preliminary work of collecting Informationas to the position in different countries should be undertaken iffthe/&quot;ll-
in the Office itself and that the questionnaire should put specific questions to the Governments as to the possibility of drawing up a convention or conventions for some definite reform and as to the provisions which such conventions should contain.     I think it is essential that if the Labour Organisation is to reach practical results, it must receive from the Govern-ments the clearest possible indication as to what steps they consider practicable in regard to the matters under considera-tion.     Unless that information is given, there must always be a great risk that the suggestions submitted by the Office to the Conference will prove unacceptable to the Governments and in consequence that the work of the Organisation and Its value as a means of promoting Improved conditions for labour will be fatally weakened,     I think these difficulties ,will be esneci-ally felt in connection with the questions relating to agrlcul-tural employment which are to be considered at the Conference next year.     These questions, which were placed on tho agenda as a result of Italian persistence and without sufficient consideration by the Governing Body, will be very difficult and it will not be easy to obtain practical results in the shape of International Conventions.     I have suggested to M,Thomas that he should consult privately with the Departments of Agriculture in some of the most important countries with a vie&quot;; to discussing Informally beforehand on what lines and in what directions pro-gress might be possible and generally ascertaining the attitude of the Governments on this subject.     He may be able in this way to obtain a justor appreciation of the altitude of the Governments than by means of written answers to a questionnaire *-b.ich would be open to the inspection of the Conference.A suggestion has been made that the reports and draft Conventions should be submitted to the Governing Body for appro-val before they are issued.     This is not in my opinion possible.The/
members of the Governing Body would not be in a position to go into the merits of the question and if they did, the result wouldbe to anticipate the Conference and it would be extremely unlikely that the three parties in the Governing Body would beable to arrive at an agreed conclusion.     It is right, however,that the reports and draft Conventions should be submitted inadvance to the Governing Body and this will provide an opnortu-nity for the Governments &apos;bo raise any points beforehand whichthey wish.     The whole question will probably come up at thenext meeting of the Governing Body In january      I have referredto the matter at some length, as it Illustrates the difficulties that arise in connection with an International Labour Organisa-tion of this character, but I have no doubt that with good willthey will be satisfactorily overcome,60     The Director is establishing, with the anproval of theGoverning Body a system of &quot;correspondents&quot; in the more importantcountries *     He has already appointed whole time officials inthis capacity in Great Britain, France, Italy and the UnitedStates,     Their functions will be to collect information, tokeep the Office in touch with labour movements in the countryto which they are attached, to popularize the work of the Officeamong employers? and workers * organisations, and generally tofurther its aims and work,     There is obviously a risk here of friction and duplication of work and possibly of embarrassment to the Government.     The International Labour Office has directcorrummi cation with the Government in each country and will receiveofficial information on labour questions and the action of theGovernments from the Departments concerned,.   I have discussed the matter with K,Thoras who assures me that the intention isthat the correspondent shall work in full co-operation with theGovernment representative on the Governing Body,     So far as great Britain is concerned he has made a very good selection in-    &apos; Mr./-13-
Itr. Herbert, who was formerly the labour correspondence of the &quot;Times0 and is a man of good judgment, and I have no fear of his doing anything indiscreet,   I think there is no doubt that the correspondents can do&apos;very useful work, especially in keeping in touch with the employers and labour organisations. I have in fact suggested to the Director that Mr. Herbert should devote special attention to these organisations and if possible arouse a greater interest Bmon^; them in the work of the Office. -7.        A question which will come up for consideration very shortly is the selection of the President for the Conference of 1921,   That Conference will be held at Geneva, which will, under the terms of the Treaty, be the ordinary meeting place of the   Conferences of the future.   In the case of the Washington and Genoa Conferences, a distinguished American and a distinguished Italian were selected in accordance with the usual practice of International Conferences.   The position, however, will be different under the new conditions,   Switzerland cannot claim or expect that a Swiss citizen should always occupy the presidentia chair simply because the seat of the League of Nations has been fixed iij Swiss territory, and some arrangement for selecting the President will have to be devised.   No provision on the subject is contained in the Treaty beyond the provision that the Conference shall elect its own President.   The matter is one of real importance as so much of the success and smooth working of the Conference depend Upon the qualities displayed by the President. The matter of course is in the hands cf the Conference itself and neither the Governments nor the Governing Body can in any way-dictate to the conference i. but the Governing Body ought to considered   the matter inadvance and be prepared with some suggestions, and I should be glad to know if the Cabinet have any Instructions,to give me in the matter.   If I might venture to make a suggestion it is that Mr. Barnes should be considered in connection with theConference
Conference of 1921.   His prestige in the Organisation, as you know, is very great and I &quot;believe it would be possible to secure his nomination..   If we do not move,, 2 think we may take it as certain that the French will, to secure a French President.8f        The co-operative movement are demanding representation in the Labour Conference and on tho Governing Body of the Labour Office.   The Governing Body to whom the application has been submitted are unanimous in thinking that the demand is an Impossible one, but M, Thomas, who is an enthusiastic co-operator, has obtained the consent of r.he Governing Body to address -a communication to each of the Governments suggesting that in future they should appoint a representative of the co-operators as one of the technical advisers to the official delegates to tho Conference.   He will urge this on tho. ground that they will represent, the consumers1&apos; point of view,-  When the matter was being discussed I pointed out that the co-operative movement is now very closely connected,. at any rate in England, *with the labour movement and the amalgamation cf their organisation for political purposes with the labour movement is under consideration. Also the co-operatives only represent one section of consumers and the Government if they thought it desirable to appoint a represent-ative of the consumers, might think it preferable to appoint a different kind of representative.   The Government itself represents the consumers and no special representation appears to me to bs necessary.   The workers1 group in the Governing Body were not willing to find a place for the eo-cperators among their technical advisers.-   It was made quite clear in assenting to the Director&apos;s request that the Governing&apos; Body was not to be understood as expressing any endorsement of the proposal.-9.        Places on the Governing Body were reserved for the United States,- on their entrance into the League - but they are &amp;0J-present filled by representatives from other States.   It is interesting
JL (lrrteJcostlog-^-no-tre -ttart &quot;Vatf^Vnlted &quot;S-Urt-es -Government ha ve expressed si desire to take part in the Emigration Inquiry (referred to above), and to lie officially represented on the Tommis-sion; and the Governing Body has acceded to this request. The appointment of Dr. Meeker, the head t*f the Statistical Department in the Ministry of Labour at Washington, will also help.to draw American interest to the work of the Labour Office.10.      Germany is represented on the Governing Body by an official representative (Dr. Leymann) -who took part in the International Labour Conference at Berne (191?) before the war -and by a labour representative (Lcgien).   They say little - and their attitude has not been in any way difficult or obstructive. The Director tells me that great interest is being taken in Germany, particularly amcng the Unions, in the work wf the Office.11.      It will greatly assist the Labour Office if the Government Departments viill communicate to the Office all reports and official publications (periodical or other) on any question affecting labour (whether industrial commercial, agricultural, maritime etc;)-, as soon s s they appear.   This is already being done, but only; partially, and it is desirable that systematic arrangements should be made in each Department.   A formal request has been addressed to me by the Director on the subject which I am circulating to the Departments concerned.12.      Some Governments are already finding it necessary to make special arrangements for dealing with the questions arising in connection with the work of the International Labour Or- anisa-tion.   Italy has establisned a special secretariat at Rome for the purpose, and France has specially detached M. Fontaine, the President of the Governing Body, for this work.   The Japanese Government are sending a commissioner with a selected staff Jt trained men to Europe, who is establishing himself at Geneva.Some
Some special organisation will., I think, also ho required in this country and I have already discussed the matter informally with you.     The position is very much tho seme as the position in regard to tho Loa^u^ of Nations work, with wh.ieh of course it is   closely connected.     The work of tho Labour Organisation co n o&apos; rn s a numb :r of Departs nt. s.     11 ha o a loo i nt e mat i o nal bearings which have to he taken into account.     I have also pointed out above the importance to the labour Office of obtaining clear indictionc of Government policy.     Some inter-departmental organisation r&quot;hich would be in close touah with the Departments mainly concerned and also with your office seems to be indicated.13&apos;     I attach a volume containing the Standing Orders adopted by the Governing Body.
