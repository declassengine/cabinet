DANZIG.Report pros on to A to and ado ^ tod .by the Council,oi &quot;The^^^gn^o^ Nations mooting, in ^ruasoTft ,&quot;0cto^or7T^* (Circulated for Information).At its last Session in Paris, the Council decided that the question of tho constitution of the future Free City of Danzig should be placed on the Agenda of the Brussels meeting.Tho 3gcrotary-General has recently.circulated to the IviOmbors of the Council the following documents on this question:-(1)   A Note from the Socrotary-Genoral in which ho communicated to the Council tho Report of M. Loon. Bourgeois at tho Council Meeting at Paris, which suggested that tho Secretary-General should attend tho Conference of Ambassadors in order to obtain information on tho Agreement to be negotiated by the Principal Allied Powers between tho Free City and tho Polish Government (Council Do 1 uniont No.81).(2)   A copy, with French and English translation, of the Draft Constitution of Danzig, in the form in which it has boon drawn up by.tho duly nominated Representatives of the City and of the Territory of Danzig., elected for this purpose (Council Document 81a.)(3)   Memorandum by tho Secrotary-General dealing with certain points affecting the question of tho guarantee of the League of Cations, under which the Constitution of the Free City of Danzig is to bo placed.
(4)   Kota by tho Secretary-General transmitting to tho Members of the Council a copy of a lottar from Paris, dated October 20th, 1920, from tho President of tho Conference of Ambassadors to the Secretary-General, with the following annexesj-(a) Copy of the tert, dated October 19th, 1920,of tho draft Convention between Poland and tho Free City of Danzig, provided for by Article 104 of tho Treaty of Versailles.(b) Note concerning the draft Constitution of the Free City of Danzig, from the point of view of the Treaty of Versailles.It was not possible to distribute these docu-ments to tho Members of the Council until within tho last few days-.     The Memorandum by tho Secretary-General mentioned in paragraph 3 examines in dotail the Draft Constitution and raises a large number of important questions which the Council must consider before it can decide whether this Constitution should bo placed under the guarantee of the league cf nations, and whether the League should consent to the Free City being placed under its pro tec 1, ion nThe Draft Treaty with Poland only reached the Secretary-General oil the evening of tho 21st instant.I am of tho opinion that tho question whether tho League of notions should guarantee the Constitution of tho Free City of Danzig, and also the closely connected question of whether the J&apos;roo City of Danzig should be placed under tho protection of the League of Nations, are problems of such great importance and ones which raise so many points requiring the most careful consideration, that it would not bo desirable to discuss this matter at present, but rather to postpone it to the coming Meeting of the Council at Geneva.
If the Council agrees to this view, it should instruct the Rapporteur to prepare at the earliest possible moment a detailed report which might ? the basis of a full discussion of the matter.

It would seem desirable for the Council to ask the Constituent Assembly of Danzig to send a Representative to be present at Geneva when this matter is discussed, in order that he may be able to give any information the Council may require. The importance of the relations between Danzig and Poland make it desirable also to ask the Polish Government to send a representative to be present at the Council. This representative would be able to give, for the information of the Council, his views as to the Constitution of the  Free City of Danzig.
