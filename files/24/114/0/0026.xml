UBOUR.SCRBT  he special extension of Out-of-Work Donation at 20s. aCP.    week for ax-Serviee men oomeB to an end at the close of next 2o.      week when the new unemployment Insuranoe %ot comes into force. The AOt will, however, make no provision for the large number of ex-Service men belonging to trades not previously insured, who will be unemployed on that date.    This was not overlooked in July when the Special Extension terminating on November 8th was granted, and it was then contemplated that it would be sufficient to make a further grant from the hxohequer as from November Oth, at the rate provided by the Act, viz, lbs a week.In view, however, of the cost of living, the amount of unemployment and the general state of feeling in the country, this reduction in the rate of payment irpm 2Qs. to 15s. for ex-Service men ts^mpOsilbte,.     20s. wHoTTIs only equivalent to to a pre-war 7sIs tlie&quot;&quot;lowest figure possible.An extension of donation to ex-Service men at 20s. a week and providing a maximum of 15 weeks1 donation in the period from, November 8th,1920, to the end of March 1921, would cost about ;c5,000,000 assuming the &quot;waiting period&quot; to be three days as under the new Act and not six days as at present.There is, however, considerable difficulty in proposing a further oayment to ex-Service men at 20s. while the rate of benefit to be paid to contributors under the new Act is only 15s.     Ellis would certainly lead to a demtnd for a corres-ponding increase in the rate of benefit in all cases.I am satisfied myself that the 15s. rate of benefit-under the new Act is inadequate, and the increasing &quot;civilian&quot; unemployment which is Inevitable this winter will force this sharply to the front.     I am definitely of opinion that much the best and, in the end, the oheape&amp;t - plan will be at once to pass a short Act (which should not be controversial) increasing the benefit provided under the Act forthwith to 20s. ana fixing a higher rate of contributions from employers and workmen to be paid as soon as the necessary administrative . arrangements can be made,    The Aot should also provide a special benefit to ex-Servioe men enabling them to receive 20s. a week for a maximum of 15 weeks between the date when it is passed and the beginning of July ne3.t.   Up to the date of the passing of the Act donation should be continued to ex-Service men at 20s. a week.   Assuming that the Act is passed by the middle of December, the effect would be to provide fully for ex-Service men till towards the end of noxt Uarch, and this would be a favourable date for refusing &amp; further free grant to ex-Service men./Details
Details oi the soheme are given in the Appendix.   On the beet estimate that oan be made, the oost to the Exchequer in addition to the oost to the.fixchequer of the present Act, would be; -In the poiioduU:j to July 19El (entirely for the benefit *. .       ^ ........   ^ ex-Service men);-ill.000,000 in respeot of donation up to the passing of the Act (assumed to be about five weeks). 2,700,000 in respeot of free benefit for ex-Service men from the passing of the Act till July,1921, after oharging to the Unemployment l^und the amount otherwise due under the Act.Annually thereafter (for the benefit of all insured persons);-12,000,000.It is proposed that the ooet of increasing the general rate of benefit to 20s. for men and 16s, for women (apart from the free gr;nt to ex-Service men) in the interval up to July,1921, shall be borne by the Unemployment Fund, which has an accumulated balance of  22,000,000 arising partly from tho relief afforded to the imnd whilst donation was boing paid.fhe general advantages of this proposal may be summarised as follows;-(a) !i?he exchequer will bo relieved of the oost of a further immediate grant of donation, whioh would be about ^b,000,000 even if stopped at the end of next March.   the  total oost of the proposal to the Exchequer for the period up to July is t1y700.000.(b) The subsequent annual oost to the Exchequer of ^2,000,000 is fully compensated for by the following advantages;-(i) The higher rate of benefit (20s.) will go far to minimise the need for relief works or similar costly expedients in future winters;(ii) with an unemployment oonefit cf 20s. as a basis, the very difficult and urgent problem of reforming the poor Law in respeot of the able-bodied will be rendered muoh more tractable.I therefore ask for authority to introduoe a Bill as a saatter of urgency to ^ive effeot to these proposals. pending the passing of the Act I also ask for authority to continue the weekly payments feared the O03t of the Bxohequer to unemployed ex-Servioe men and women and merchant seamen, tho rato for men being 20s. and for women 15s, as under the existing donation scheme.
