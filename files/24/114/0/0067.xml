LOCAL AUTHORITIES, THEIR EMPLOYEES, ANDTRADE UNIONS.CASE FOR THE OPINION OF THE LAW OFFICERS OF THE CROWN.The attention of the Minister of Health has been drawn to several cases in which local authorities have been exercising pressure of various kinds upon their employees for the purpose of compelling them to become members of Trade Unions, and he desires to be favoured with the opinion of the Law Officers upon certain legal questions which arise in connection therewith.In the first cases which were brought to his notice the local authority had passed a resolution to the effect that increases of salary by way of war bonus or the merging of war bonus and salary should be conditional upon the officer or workman being a member of a Trade Union or becoming a member within a specified time. In a later case a local authority caused a poster to be issued to the following effect: &quot; The Council on the 11th February, 1920, passed the following resolution, viz.: &quot; That all employees of the Council be members of their respective Trade Unions.Borough Engineer.&quot;There have also been cases, as the Minister understands, where employees who did not fulfil the required conditions have had their employment terminated. In one instance in the metropolitan district a local authority terminated the employment of a workman, an ex-soldier, solely on the ground that at the date of his engagement shortly after his demobilisation, he was not a member of a Trade Union, although he had become one since. The local authority in this case, however, were compelled by the local Association of Discharged Soldiers and Sailors to reinstate the workman, after some uproarious scenes, during which the Council Chamber itself was invaded by sympathisers of the dismissed man.It appears to the Minister that the liberty of the subject is directly challenged by the action of any local authority who make the payment of additional salary or wages, avowedly granted to meet the increased cost of living which presses upon all citizens alike, dependent upon membership of a particular trade organisation. A local authority is a popularly elected body representative of the ratepayers in general, and ought not, in the Ministers opinion, to differentiate between its employees on any such grounds. The Law Officers will appreciate the danger of the introduction of a system in which the conditions of employment may become dependent upon the political colour of the employers, whatever that maybe, thereby forcing the employees, who should be the neutral servants of all parties, into the political arena. The wholesome rule which prohibits civil servants from engaging in political activities would seem on all grounds to be equally applicable to servants of local authorities throughout the country.The Minister, however, recognises that there are grave difficulties in the way of taking effective action for the purpose of checking the policy of the local authorities to which he has referred above. A memorandum is attached to this case which sets out the powers which the Ministry of Health are legally entitled to exercise in connection with the dismissal of their employees by local authorities. From this it will be seen (1) that there is no provision enabling the Minister to withhold payment of any Parliamentary Grant administered by this Department for the purpose of bringing pressure to bear on any local authority acting in the manner complained of;(2) that the consent of the Minister is in general not required for the dismissal of any officer or servant of a county council, town council, urban or rural district council or London borough council, save in certain circumstances in the case of the medical officer of health and sanitary inspector;(3) that the Minister has a greater measure of control over the appointment and dismissal of officers and servants of Boards of Guardians by reason of Section 46 of the Poor Law Amendment Act, 1834, which gives him power m  (33)12113 Pk69 250 11/20 E&amp;S
by Order to direct the mode of appointment and to determine the con-tinuance in office or dismissal of paid officers of the Guardians. This power has, however, only been exercised in the case of clerks and treasurers to.Boards of Guardians, medical officers, chaplains, masters and matrons, schoolmasters and schoolmistresses of workhouses, superintendent nurses and relieving officers, and the tendency is more and more to leave minor matters of administration in the hands of the Guardians themselves.It has been suggested that the auditors might take note of the differentiation in pay of two officers doing the same work; but it is difficult to see on what grounds they could surcharge the higher payment, which, ex hypothesi, would be payment at current trade union rates, and for this reason could scarcely be surcharged as an extravagant, and therefore possibly illegal, payment, whatever it might be in fact. Legislation would therefore seem to be required if differential payments are to be prohibited, but for the reason above given this does not appear to be a practicable solution, inasmuch as the real complaint is, not that a higher rate is being paid to one officer, but that a lower rate is being paid to another. - &apos;Similarly, while it might be theoretically possible to enact that all employees of a local authority of the same grade should receive the same salary j it is difficult to see that any practicable means exist (short of giving the employees of a local authority absolute security of tenure) to prevent the authority from dispensing with the services of non-unionists in their employment; and in this way an authority, while adhering to &apos; the&quot; letter &quot;of the law, would entirely defeat its object and intention.The Minister would accordingly be glad to be favoured with the opinion of the Law Officers on the following questions: (1) Whether, under the existing law,&quot;it is possible for him to take any effective action to prevent discrimination on the part of local authorities in the matter of salary or wages between their officers and servants who are and who are not members of a trade organisation?(2) Whether the action of local authorities in discriminating between their officers and servants in the manner indicated can be legally challenged, and, if so, in what way ?(3) Whether an auditor would be legally entitled to surcharge members of a local authority the cost of printing and issuing the poster referred to in the above case by reason of its illegality on grounds of public policy or otherwise ?(4) Whether, if the answers to the above questions are in the negative, the i&apos;    ,        difficulty can be satisfactorily dealt with by an amendment of the law, and, if so, what form that amendment should take ?
A.-THE WITHHOLDING OF GRANTS PAYABLE TO LOCAL AUTHORITIES IN AID OF THEIR EXPENDITURE.The principal grants payable by the Minister of Health in aid of the expenditure of local authorities are those authorised to &quot;be made to the councils of counties and county boroughs from the Local Taxation Account under Sections 20 and 22 of the Local Government Act, 1888.The basis on which the grants are to be distributed by the Minister is prescribed by the Act. The sums so received by the council of a county and county borough are to be carried to the Exchequer Contribution Account of the council, and are directed to be applied in the payment of the grants to boards of guardians and other local authorities in the county or borough in the manner set out in Sections 23 to 26 of the Act. In certain special cases conditions have to be satisfied before the grant is payable. Thus if a medical officer of health has failed to send the Ministry his report and such returns as are required by the Regulations, the grant covering one-half of his salary becomes forfeited [Section 24 (2) (c)]. Similarly if the Home Secretary witholds his certificate as to the efficiency of a police force, the grant in aid of the police is forfeited under Section 25 of the Act.But there is no provision enabling the Minister of Health to withhold payments from the Local Taxation Account to the council of a county or county borough or enabling such council to withhold any grant payable by them to a board of guardians or other local authority on the score of extravagance on the part of the authority.The grants made by the Minister to spending authorities under the Agricultural Rates Act, 1896, from the Local Taxation Account are made specifically in respect of the deficiency in the produce of rates arising from the partial exemption of agricultural , land under the Act. The manner in which the share of each spending authority is to be arrived at is prescribed by Section 4 of the Act, and there is no power to withhold the grant thus ascertained from the spending authority.Grants made by the Board of Education in aid of elementary education are on a different footing, because the conditions to be fulfilled are prescribed in the Education Code, but it is very doubtful whether a condition enabling a grant to be reduced or withheld because the local education authority were paying excessive allowances to their employees could properly be inserted in the Code by the Board of Education.B.-DISMISSAL OF OFFICIALS OF LOCAL AUTHORITIES.(1) Borough Gouncils in London. As regards officers and servants of the London borough councils, the consent of the Minister of Health is necessary, under Section 108 (2) (6) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, and the Order of the Local Government Board of 8th December, 1891, to the removal from office of a medical officer of health or sanitary inspector who was not appointed for a limited period. But in general, other officers and servants of the London borough councils hold office under Section 62 of the Metropolis Management Act, 1855, which allows the borough council to remove at pleasure any officer or servant appointed under the section, without the consent of any Government Department.(2) Borough Gouncils outside London. The town clerk and borough treasurer hold office during the pleasure of the town council (see Sections 17 (2), 18 (2), of the M.C. Act, 1882). The tenure of other officers appointed under the Act of 1882 is not similarly prescribed by Section 19, 1882, and apparently depends on the terms on which the particular appointment was made.As regards officers appointed by a town council under the Public Health Act, 1875, a medical officer of health and a sanitary inspector, not appointed in either case for a limited period, can only be dismissed with the consent of the Minister of Health. This protection extends only to officers, one half of whose salaries is repaid from the Exchequer Contribution Account of the county or county borough council under section 24 of the Local Government Act, 1888, and if the borough council do not desire repayment from the Exchequer Contribution Account, the medical officer of health or sanitary inspector would hold office at the pleasure of the town council under section 189 of the Public Health Act, 1875. Other officers of the town council appointed under the Act of 1875, similarly hold office at the pleasure of the council under section 189/1875.(3) Officers of Urban and Rural District Gouncils. The officers of these bodies almost invariably hold office under the Public Health Act, 1875, and would be in the same position as regards dismissal as the officers of town councils mentioned in the preceding paragraph of this memorandum.
(4) Officers of County Councils. The Clerk of the Peace (who is ordinarily also clerk of the county council) and the county treasurer are subject to special enact-ments. Other officers of a county council are either appointed under Section 19 of the Municipal Corporations Act, 1882, which is applied to county councils by Section 75 of the Local Government Act, 1888, or under Acts of Parliament con-ferring a special power to appoint officers, such as the Diseases of Animals Acts and the Weights and Measures Act. As has already been stated, Section 19 of the Municipal Corporations Act, 1882, does not provide that officers appointed under its provisions shall hold office at the pleasure, of the council, and the tenure of office would depend on the terms on which the particular appointment was made.A county medical officer of health can only be removed by the county council with the consent of the Minister of Health (see Section 68 (5) of the Housing, Town Planning, &amp;c, Act, 1909).(5) Officers of Boards of Guardians. These officers are in a different position to the officers already mentioned. Under Section 46 of the Poor Law Amendment Act, 1834, the Minister of Health has power by order to direct the mode of appointment and &quot;determine the continuance in office or dismissal of&quot; paid officers of the guardians. This power has been exercised by General Orders, and by an Order of the 12th February, 1879, the Local Government Board directed that every master, matron, schoolmaster and schoolmistress of a workhouse and every relieving officer appointed after the 28th February, 1879, should continue to hold office until death, resignation or dismissal by the guardians, subject to the consent of the Local Government Board, or by the Local Government Board, or proved insane on such evidence as the Board might deem sufficient.A similar tenure of office had been conferred on medical officers of workhouses and district medical officers by the Medical Appointments Order of the 25th May, 1857, and the clerk to the guardians, chaplain of the workhouse and treasurer of the guardians can only be dismissed by the Minister of Health under Article 187 of the Consolidated Order of 1847.Any porter, nurse, assistant or servant may, however, be dismissed by the guardians without the consent of the Minister as successor to the Local Government Board, under Article 188 of the General Consolidated Order of 1847, but the consent of the Minister is required to the dismissal of any superintendent nurse under Article 6 of the Poor Law Institutions (Nursing) Order, 1913. A superintendent nurse is appointed for every institution of the guardians containing not less than 100 beds for sick inmates. The consent of the Minister is not, however, required to the dismissal of a head nurse employed at smaller institutions.For many years the policy of the Department has been in favour of a relaxation of their power of control over the appointment and dismissal of subordinate officers of the guardians. Thus as far back as 1867 an Order was issued by the Poor Law Board giving boards of guardians full control over the appointment and dismissal of all officers employed in the relief of the indoor &apos; poor, other than the principal officers mentioned in Article 3 of the Order.The position is, therefore, that principal officers of the guardians could not be dismissed by the guardians on a refusal to join a Trade Union, but that subordinate officers could be so dismissed.OPINIONofTHE LAW OFFICERS OF THE CROWN.(1), (2) and (3). There is not in our opinion anything illegal in -the action of the local authorities complained of, and we think, therefore, that the first three questions should be answered in the negative.(4). Except by giving the Minister full control over the appointment and dismissal and salaries of all employees of local authorities, we do not think that the difficulty can be satisfactorily dealt with by legislation. It would, we think, be possible to evade any statutory provisions of a less drastic character.GORDON HEWART. &apos; E. M. POLLOCK.Law Officers&apos; Department, 7th October, 1920.
