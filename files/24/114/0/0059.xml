Circulated by the Secretary of State for India,SECRET.Grievances of Indians in Kenya.A difference lias arisen between the Colonial Office and the India Office regarding the treatment of Indians resident in the territory formerly called the East Africa Protectorate which is now known as Kenya Colony and Kenya Protectorate. This territory contains an Indian population greatly outnumbering the European popnla-tion. The figures shown in the current issue of the Colonial Office List are 17,427 Asiatics, 5,570 Europeans.   The Asiatics are nearly all Indians.The Indian community have put forward two principal claims : (1) that a policy of race segregation which has recently been adopted should be reversed;(2) that their future political status should as far as possible be guaranteed.(1) The economic position of the Indian community is seriously threatened by New policy this policy of race segregation.   The Kenya Indians are wholesale and retail traders, of race middlemen, market gardeners, professional men, clerks, artisans, &amp;c.   Their livelihood segregation, for the most part depends on economic relations with the European settlers and with the African natives as well as with one another.   Under the policy of race segregation they would be restricted in their right to own land and to occupy business premises in the quarters where their business interests lie.This policy has been adopted without consultation with the India Office and in spite of the objections put forward on behalf of the Government of India. The Colonial Government has been directed that the principle of separate localities for separate races should be adhered to in residential areas and whenever practicable in commercial areas also. As a general rule no transfer of land either by way of ownership or mortgage between Europeans and Asiatics in townships is to be allowed, and new plots put up to auction in the European or Asiatic quarters are to be reserved to European or Asiatic bidders as the case may be.The grounds on which the new policy was based were at first sanitary require-ments, but these could clearly have been satisfied by sanitary regulations applied without racial discrimination ; it is now based also on grounds of social comfort, social convenience, and social peace ; that is, race segregation is put forward as a desirable principle in itself quite independent of sanitary grounds.The Government of India could never acquiesce in race segregation on social or Probable any other grounds, because it implies a stigma of racial inferiority ; but, although the economic policy is defended ostensibly on social grounds, it is probable that, so far as its local f1^.1^ ^ European supporters are concerned, there is also an economic motive.    Similar ^^policy ostensible grounds have been put forward in support of a similar policy in the Transvaal, but it is notorious that the real object of attempts at segregation there is c^u^.ous trade rivalry.   Segregation has also been advocated in the Transvaal as a means of stances in squeezing Indians out of the country by economic pressure.   There is danger that a the Trans-similar method of dealing with Indians will suggest itself, if it has not already done vaal-so, to the European settlers in Kenya, for their avowed object appears to be to make the Colony a white man&apos;s country so far as possible, and they desire to imitate the anti-Asiatic policy which has been pursued in South Africa.It is relevant to observe in regard to South Africa that His Majesty&apos;s Government Opposition have always followed the policy of opposing and, so far as local European opinion of His would permit, limiting the operation of the law in the Transvaal as to Asiatic locations Majesty^ both before the South African War and during the period of Crown government. ^0J^^f During the latter period in 1904 Lord Milner as Governor proposed an Ordinance to tkm polfcy J require Asiatics in municipalities to live and trade within bazaars, except those fitted in the for a European mode of life and those who had acquired vested interests before the Transvaal, war.   Mr. Lyttelton, the Secretary of State for the Colonies, declined to sanction any tJvg restriction of Asiatics to trade in locations, and also laid down the principle that &quot; those jn 1904. &quot; required to live in locations or bazaars should be so required for sanitary reasons in *- each case.&quot;1   As a result of Mr. Lyttelton&apos;s despatch the proposed Ordinance was1 Cd. 2239.2627   100  11.20 A
Futility of attemptingdropped. Thus, in South Africa His Majesty&apos;s Government have refused to acknow-ledge that racial segregation in itself is a desirable object and have refused to sanction it and have prevented complete effect being given to it. The law in the Transvaal (No. III. of 1885), as interpreted by the Courts, permits locations to be set aside for the residence of Asiatics but does not place restrictions on their occupation of business-premises. It thus appears that the view that race segregation is a good thing in itself, which is now enunciated by the Colonial Office, is an entirely new doctrine and one which is at variance with the established policy of the Imperial Government.Moreover, any attempt to carry out such a policy seems likely to stultify itself. In a town where there is a mixed population of various races, there is a naturalraces m their ecouo mic life.^L!!8;!?^6 tendency for each race to centre, for purposes of residence, of its own accord in a separate quarter so long as no attempt is made to compel such separation. If, from, misguided economic motives, an attempt is made to compel each race to reside and trade in a particular quarter only, such restraint on the natural course of trade inevitably provokes resentment, and every effort will be made to avoid the operation of the law. The history of the law which prohibits the ownership of land by Asiatics in the Transvaal affords abundant experience of this.Political status ; present position.Prayer for a declaration by His Majesty&apos;s Government of a policy of equal political status.Indian anxiety owing to anti-Indian attitude of non-official Europeans.Influence of non-official Europeans on the Govern-ment.(2) The present position of the question of political status is as follows : In July 1919 the Royal Assent was given to an Ordinance for the election of representatives of the European community to the Legislative Council. This creates eleven territorial constituencies, each returning one member. The franchise appears to be manhood suffrage, and illiteracy is not a disqualification. The Ordinance made no provision for the representation of Indians, in November 1919 the Eastern Africa Indian National Congress asked that at least one-third of the seats in the Legislative Council should be allotted to Indian elected representatives. After discussion between the Colonial Office and India Office, it has been decided that two Indian, representatives shall be elected to the Council on a special franchise, as to which the Governor is to make recommendations. It is hoped that the franchise will be a generous one, and though the number of representatives must be regarded as inadequate and ought to be gradually increased, I do not press for further action on this part of the Indian claim immediately, not because the action taken is right in extent or principle, but because I despair of any further change at the moment.But in addition to asking for practical steps towards adequate representation, the Congress of November 1919 also passed a resolution praying the Imperial Government to make a definite declaration of &quot; their policy about the equality of political status of Indians.&quot;   Their anxiety in regard to this is grounded on (a) the declared anti-Indian policy of the non-official Europeans ;(b) the fact that the latter already control 11 seats in the legislature ; and(c) indications that they anticipate the ultimate grant of self-government andresulting freedom to exclude Indian immigrants and impose every kind of disabilitv on Indian residents.(a) above is clearly illustrated by certain resolutions of the (European) Conven-tion of Associations of British East Africa (called &quot; The White Man&apos;s Parliament&quot;) passed at its 1919 session.   These are quoted in the Annex.&quot;(e) is indicated by the language of the resolutions quoted in the Annex, and by the claim put forward therein by the European Convention to representation in the Imperial Conference (see the last, part of the Annex); it is further, illustrated by a chapter included in the first draft of the Report of the recent East Africa Protectorate Economic Commission; the chapter in question advocated the federation of the various British territories in Central Africa as a Dominion.Moreover, it is natural to regard the recent addition of 11 elected European members to the Legislative Council as the first step in the process of evolution from Crown Colony government to representative government and finally to responsible Dominion government. In future the legislative body will no longer consist solely of the nominees of the executive Government, but will contain a large elected European element which maybe expected to grow and presently become, if the natural process is continued and unless the Indian representation is much increased, a very Jarge majority of . its.. lnembei^s. It follows that, unless and until Indians as welt as Europeans are adequately represented, those Europeans who have passed the resolu-tions of the &quot; White Mari&apos;-g Parliament&quot; will presently be in a position to give legislative effect to their ideas.
One of their principal ideas is &quot; that steps should be taken at once to restrict Declared &quot; Asiatic immigration in order that this stronghold of European colonisation in Central anji-Indian &quot; Africa may stand beside her sister colonies in their Asiatic policy.&quot;1   That is, the JIJn.c^,ial ultimate policy of the new Dominion will be Asiatic exclusion on the South African Europeans, model.   In the meantime the non-official Europeans will advocate a policy of legis-lative and administrative discouragement and harassment of the Indians already in the colony by the invention of social and economic disabilities.   For example, the European resolutions recommended disabling Indians from holding land, save in townships on short leases, as well as the permanent refusal of any franchise to them.The reasons advanced for this anti-Asiatic policy both in these resolutions and in Alleged a passage of the Report of the Economic Commission which deals with the question reason of are the alleged interests of the African native.   He is said to suffer morally from an^-Inclian contact with Indian culture, and economically and educationally from the competition p0 lcy&quot; of Indian craftsmen.   It is worth noting as a comment on these allegations that the positive recommendations which the Commission made in the interests of the natives included in encouraging them to emigrate from their reserves and to become labour tenants on European farms.It is natural that the Indian community should feel alarm about its future. Reasons for Although neither the resolutions of unofficial Europeans nor a Commission^ recom- suggested mendations are the views of the Government, they are the views of those who seek ^^parti and expect at some future date to control the Government.   Moreover, in view of the 0f His attitude of the Government, particularly in regard to race segregation, Indians may Majesty&apos;s feel that it is disposed to do less than what lies in its power and might reasonably be Government., expected of it to resist the policy which European opinion seeks to impose.   A. declaration by His Majesty&apos;s Government of a policy of equality of status would restore confidence and be an answer to the European non-officials who are already in a position to exercise large influence and have announced their own policy of denying political and other rights to Indians.   It is not suggested that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment should undertake to give full immediate effect to such a policy in the matter of political status, but that equality of status might be declared to be the ultimate aim of policy in regard to Indians in Kenya, to be worked out gradually, and that it should be accepted as the guiding principle of the administration.The position of the Government of India on this question was declared hy the Viceroy on 30th January 1920, in a speech at the opening of a session of the Indian Legislative Council, to be &quot; that there is no justification in a Crown Colony or &quot; Protectorate for assigning to British Indians a status in any way inferior to that &quot; of any other class of His Majesty&apos;s subjects/&apos;This utterance was made with reference to the grievances of Indians in Kenya, and the failure to remove those grievances has now given rise to a widespread demand in India that, if effect cannot be given to the principle enunciated by the Viceroy, the Government of India should embark on some form of retaliation against the colony. A declaration such as is suggested should do much to allay anxiety in Kenya and to overcome the dissatisfaction and embarrassing demands to which the Kenya grievances give rise in India.The Government of India is naturally unable to decline a certain degree,of Locusstandi responsibility in the affairs of Indians who have settled in other parts of the Empire. ^0^n It has the responsibility which rests on. every Government for the protection of its ment 0j.. , nationals abroad.   Failure to secure redress of their just grievances tends to react India, very seriously on the political situation in India itself.   This tendency inevitably becomes greater with the progress of India towards&apos; responsible government and her admission side by side with the Dominions to the League of Nations.   Such failure also throws discredit on the principle of the Imperial connection, and lowers the prestige of the Government of India when the result of its representations is revealed as less effective than the action which an independent Government might take to secure the protection of its nationals in a foreign country.These considerations apply to the grievances of Indians even in the Self-. Discredit Governing Dominions.   The disabilities imposed on the Indian community in South y^J^011 Africa particularly have long been, a serious embarrassment to the Government of Joyemtaeift India.   Anti-government critics in India on the score of these disabilities, have with by existence difficulty been convinced of the impotence of the Imperial Government in regard to of Indian the Self-Governing Dominions.   But if similar disabilities are imposed on Indians in disabilities___Z._1_ &apos; &apos;___. in a Crown1 Resolution passed by the European Convention at its 1919 session. Colony.2627 A 2
fepeoiaJ reasons against assigning an inferior status to Indians in Kenya.Conclusion.a Crown Colony or a Protectorate, the position is obviously altered. Not only is it impossible to disclaim responsibility on behalf of the Imperial Government but doubt is also cast in the minds of Indians on the bona fides of the disclaimers already made&apos; in regard to the Dominions. If an anti-Indian policy appears to be accepted by. His Majesty&apos;s Government in deference to European demands in Kenya, His Majesty&apos;s Government will also be suspected of worse than passive acquiescence in the anti-Indian policy which has been pursued in South Africa.The resentment which is aroused in India when Indians in&apos;anyp)ominionor Colony-are assigned an inferior status is especially marked in the case of Kenya for the following reasons: (a) The numerical preponderance of the Indian population.(b) Their substantial interests.(c) The territory has been developed by Indian capital and Indian labour(especially that employed on the Uganda Railway).(d) The close economic relations between India and East Africa.(e) The historical connection of Indians with the East Africa coast which datesfrom a period very much earlier than that of the British Protectorate or the advent of British Europeans. ( /) The employment of Indian troops in East Africa during the war. (g) The fact that Indians are classified with Europeans for purposes of taxation.I may recapitulate the claims which are made by the Government of India on behalf of the Indian community in Kenya.   They are : (I) That the policy of race segregation should be abandoned. It is a policy of disastrous interference in the vital economic interests of the relatively large Indian community on racial grounds. Its adoption on these grounds is not only a new departure but is at variance with the traditional policy of the Imperial. Government.(2) That the Indian community should be reassured as to its political security by a declaration that the policy of the Imperial Government contemplates their ultimate attainment of a stattis of political equality with Europeans.E. S. M. &apos;1st November 1920.Annex.Resolution of Convention of Associations.The following resolutions were unanimously passed with reference to the petition re Indians : This Convention wishes to point out to the Government that during the discussion-of the petition re Indians, as also those affecting the native peoples of this country, they had the assistance of four missionaries, one being Roman Catholic and three being from the Missionary Conference, which was sitting in Nairobi at the same time as the Convention.That whereas our nation has assumed responsibility for the future of the indigenous East African peoples and of the countries they inhabit :And whereas our national ideals of enlightenment and progress are crystallised in our Christian western civilisation, and it is our duty to make sure that the best contained therein is readily available for the needs of awakening Africa :And whereas the maintenance of this country depends entirely on the prestige and force of character of the white man :And whereas certain Indians have entered this country as traders, clerks, and artizans :And whereas these people follow in all things a civilisation which is eastern and I in many respects repugnant to ours :And whereas their social status brings them more frequently into contact with the African and thus subjects him to intimate personal influences, antagonistic to the ideals of the west:And whereas the African has shown that he possesses latent qualities which under western guidance hold promise of material development and an aptitude for filling various needs of industry, more particularly those which involve the use of. mechanical appliances :
And whereas Indian competition denies him all incentives to ambition and opportunities of advancement:And whereas the Indian community in this country are agitating for adult suffrage aud by this means seek to gain control over the destinies of the country :And whereas the Imperial Conference at a meeting held on 21th July 1918, considered the matter of reciprocal migration between India and other component parts of the Empire, and passed four resolutions, of which the principal is as follows:  &quot; It is an inherent function of the Governments of the several communities of the British Commonwealth, including India, that each should enjoy complete control over the composition of its own population by means of restriction on immigration from any other communities.&quot;and. thereby recorded as the final judgment of the British Commonwealth that the principle of self-determination shall govern immigration and the composition of populations.&quot; We, the Convention of Associations, representing the white community of the -country, pray His Excellency the Governor to approach the Right Honourable the Secretary of State for the Colonies, so that the functions thus solemnly pronounced to be inherent in the government of this British Community may be exercised by declaring forthwith that the right of self-determination rests with, the European Government of this country acting for the Europeans and in trust for the native peoples, and should ask the Secretary of State to rule that the position should not be prejudiced by giving any system of franchise to Asiatics, nor by allowing them to acquire land except in townships on short leases, nor by the employment of Asiatics in Government work, and that steps should be taken at once to restrict Asiatic immigration in order that this stronghold of European colonisation in Central Africa may stand beside her sister colonies in their Asiatic policy.And further, we beg His Excellency the Governor to make known to the Imperial Conference, through the Right Honourable the Secretary of State for the Colonies, our earnest petition that to the conquered territory, formerly called German East Africa, the same policy towards the Asiatic be applied; for the indigenous peoples of this country and of the conquered territory are of the same types, even to the extent of tribes having been served (? severed), and economic relations centuries old having been interrupted by the late artificial frontier. We can conceive, short of the retro-cession of the territory to Germany, of no transaction more immoral and more certain to recoil on our heads than the betrayal to the Asiatic of a section of the African peoples whose destinies have fallen into our hands, and who at present are unable to protect themselves. We submit that to buy off Indian or other agitation at the expense of the natives of Africa would be a policy neither wise nor honourable.In view of the far-reaching issues involving the whole future of East and Central Africa which are at stake, we, the Convention of Associations, representing the white comm.unity of East Africa, pray His Excellency the Governor to make immediate application to the Right Honourable the Secretary of State for the Colonies for the -appointment of a representative chosen by the British colonists of this country on the Imperial Conference.
