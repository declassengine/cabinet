Tho Meeting was convened by the president of the United States in conformity with Article V of the Covenant.The Council elected M. Bourgeois to tha Chair. It has been the practice of the Council, pending the ests^j; sh-ment of the League at its permanent seat, to elect as prse^u; for each. Session the representative of-the Member of the Oorjcil in whose country the session was convened.     A list of the sessions of tho Council with the questions considered is appended as an Annex to this Report.8*   The.....Finances of the League .The Council has approved the two first budgets of the League.    The first budget covers the preliminary period of the work of the League from May 5th to Juno 30th 1920*   The second budget covers the six months July 1st to December 31st 1920.The Counoil decided in September that the third budget, which covers the whole of the year 1921, should be prepared for its consideration during the Session to be held at Brussels&apos;in October, subject to ratification by the Assembly-Tho two budgets previously approved by the Council&quot;will similarly be submitted for ratification by, the Assembly.
Tho Council has decided that the financial year ofthe League shall correspond with tho calendar, year.   The Secretary-General has been instructed to present the budget of the League throe months before the end of the financialyear, and the accounts within four months following itstermination.     Under Article 11 of its Rules of Proceduretho Council Uidortaicos to present the budget each year for final approval by the Assembly as soon as circumstances permit **Accounts for the preliminary.period ending June 30th 1920 have been audited by the Comptroller and Auditor-General of the British Treasury.     The Council invj.tod the British government to a-io.it these accounts in view of the fact that the Secretariat watf or: tablished in London during the period covered by the first budget of the League.The Council decided to communicate these, accounts to all Members of the League, and to publish them in the Official Journal.Articlo VI of the Covenant provides that the expenses of the Secretariat shall be borne by the Members of the League, according to tho scale of assessment adopted for the Universal Postal Union.     This scale of assessment, though it has necessarily been followed in drafting the first budgets -of the League, seems hardly liiiely to prove satisfactory as a permanent arrangement,    a Technical Committee, appointed from among the delegates of the International Financial Conference has accordingly boon, armed to, advise the Council on the principles of assessment which should serve as a guide in estimating the financial capacity of the contributory States,Members of the League are now assed to make their payments in gold francs, and the budget, for the period July/1st to^December 31st, 1920, was drawn up on that basis.
f3&apos;   EliHIl?ions for the assembly.Tho Council telegraphed to the President of the United States on May 19th asking him in virtue of the powers conferred i.y n him by Article 6 of the Covenant, to convene the Assembly during the first fortnight of- November-   On July 12th President Wilson, in response to this invitation, summoned the Assembly tc neet on November 15th in Geneva.The Council adopted a resolution on August 5th to the effect that, pendirg the election by tho Assembly of its President, the otair at the first meeting of the Assembly should, be ta,ven by tho Acting prosit oat of the Council.(^)   Aocessione to the League. There are under the Covenant throe groups of Members or possible Members of the League(a) Signatories of the Treaty of Versailles or SaintGermain.(b) States invited under the Covenant to accede within two months of the coming into force of the Treaty of Versailles.(c) States whose Admission is Approved by the Assemblyunder Article 1.Wo difficulty has arisen with regard to the States in group (a), and a seoarsio Report is being presented to the Assembly on the. States desiring to be included in group (o).The Council was required to take an important decision with regard to Switzerland, a State belonging to group (b).Switzerland desired to have.her Military neutrality and the inviolability of her territory recognised as consistent with her Membership of the League.The Council considered the claim of Switzerland in, theif ght
light of Article 435 of the Treaty of Versaillo-s, whereby the Members of the League,. Signatories of the Treaty, recognise &quot;that the guarantees in favour of Swiss neutrality contained in the Treaties of 1815 &quot;constitute international obligations for the maintenance of peace.&quot;The Oou..-oil declared that the &quot;perpetual neutrality of Switzerland and the guarantee of the inviolability of herfcarrliofcy incorporated as in the Lav; of Nations, particularly in the Treaties and in the Act of 1815, are justified by the interests of general pesos and as such are compatible with the Covenants   It was understood, however, that Switzerland, while refusing to participate in military action bar to admit jthe passage of foreign troops, fully recognised the duties or solidarity she was incurring as a Member of the League, particularly the duty miner Article 16 of participating in any economic action taicen by the League against a Oovenant-breaiiing Stats.Stress was laid on the fact that the position of Switzerlard w.!?8 quite exceptional, and that the action of the Council was not, therefore, to bo regarded as a precedent.(5)   rThe Registration of Treaties,. The purpose of Article 18 of the Covenant is to ensure publicity for international engagements, end to provide in future for o system of open diplomacy.     The Council has interpreted in the widest practicable manner the obligations( of the League in this connection.The Council has authorised the Secretariat to register all treaties, engagements, or acts establishing obligations, between States, whether concluded before or after the covenant, and./it ishoped
15hoped that even Treatise concluded between parties neither of which 13 a i/le^bor of the League v.-ill be voluntarily presented for rogis-tration.All Members of the League have been invited to conform with tho stipulations of Article 18 of the Covenant and tho Secretariat has already begun to register the treaties presented.(6).   The^Permanent Armamonts Commiss.1 on.A Permanent Armaments Commission has been constituted under Article IV of the Covenant to advise tho Council on the execution of Articles ? and &quot;III. ane on military, naval, and air questions gen-erally.    This Commission consist:! of one naval, one military anc1 one air representative no &apos; inc. tod by each of the :;o*/ers represented on the Council.     Any other  :ember of the League will be represented when a question affecting it is .under discussion.      The Commission is divided into three Oub-Commiesion;?-, which deal respectively with military, naval anc&quot; air questions.    ,,;hess tiub-Co&quot;mlesions hove . established permanent Secretariats at the seat of the League,The Commission assembled for the first time at San Sebastian and hold meetings during the eighth Session of the Council.     It immediately began to consider the measures necessary for the execution of Article 1 of the Covenant,     It had, in particular, to advise as to the regulation:- to be prescribed by the League rdth regard to the military, naval and air force&apos;:&apos;, of the countries which had anlied for admission to the League. &apos;The Commission has been further instructed by the Council to obtain from the Bignatorie-- of the Arms Traffic Convention of the 10th September, 1919, and other States Members of the League, all the information regarding the export of arras and munitions necessary to enable the League to supervise the traffic in arms.The

In particular the Council decided that this Commission should contain a majority of members chosen from non-mandatory Powero, and suggested that it m.i/&quot;ht be well to frame a rule whereby no Member of the Co.m:::ieeion woul:i vote upon a report of the State ct ^nroiro of which he has a Representative&apos;.
()   Tho Vrit--vm11&apos;oral Vt.boiir Or^.:ilsj&amp;t to i.(a)   Co-operation between the Secretariat of the league and the Labour Organization.The Council has recognised the International Labour Organization as constituted by the first Labour Conference held at Washington in November, 1919, and has affirmed the Principle of a close co-operation between the International Labour Office and the Secretariat of the League&quot;,The relations of the International Labour Office with the Secretariat are determined by Article 398 and V:\-0 of the Treaty of Versailles.    The International Labour Office is entitled to the assistance of the Secretary General of tho League in any matter in which it can bo given, and the expenses of the Labour Organ!- -zation aro paid to tho Director of tho Labour Office by the Secretary General out of the general funds of the League,     The Director of the Labour Office is responsible to the Secretary General for the proper expenditure of all monies paid to him, but the budget of the Labour Organization is approved by the Governing  &apos; Body of the Labour Organization,The Council has approved an arrangement made by theSecretary General under which certain services of the Secretariatwere common to both organizations during the period when bothBodies were located in London,     The Council has also sanctionedan advance of  55,000 made by the Secretary General to cover theexpenses of the Washington Conference and the establishment of theLabour Office.(b)   The Claim of India to bo represented on the Governing Body of tho International Labour Offioa.Article 393 of the Treaty of Versailles provides thatthe Governing Body of the Labour Office shall.include twelve personsrepresenting the governments, eight of whom shall be nominated bythe Members of the League which are of chief industrial importance.The Article further provides that the Council of the League shalldecide which of the.

w The present Governing Body of the Labour Office wasappointed before the ratification of the Treaty of Versailles, and,IIn consequence, before the Council of the League was in a position to fulfil the duller?, on trusted to it imder Article 393.The Council has, therefore, decided to postpone its ruling on this question until the present representatives of the Governing Body have completed their term of jffico; which lasts until 19 2.

This Treaty is to come into force at the same time as the estab-liehment of the Free City.The Principal Powers on the coming into force Of the Treaty of Versailles appointed -ir Reginald Tower Temporary Administrator of Danzig.
In ordor to expedite the elaboration of the constitution of Danzig the Council of tho League, acting under Article 103, appointed Sir ft. Tower nigh Commissioner of the League.     Sir Reginald &apos;&quot;ower has, thus, a two-fild office.     He is Temporary Administrator of Danzig for the Allies and as High Commissioner for the League, he is responsible for carrying into effect the first part of Article 10*      As High Commissioner for the League he has kept the Council of the League continuously informed on all matters relating to the preparation of the Constitution.The Council, in appointing   ir F;.

Of the three members, natives of oountrios other than franco and Germany, tho first is Belgian, the second Danish, and the third a Canadian.Thu Council subsequently appointed Hector to bo Saar member of the Commission in place of M* do 3och who resignedtThe Council decided that the French Member of tho Commission should bo president in view of tho special economic interests of Franco in tho territory of the Saar and the close economic relationship which would have to be maintained between the Territory of the Saar and the provinoea of Alsace and Lorraine *The Governing Commission of the Saar. as representing the League of Nations, has in accordance with the instructions of the Council, submitted regular monthly reports upon its administration -:-nd upon general conditions in tho Territory of tho Saar.Tho Council has taken an important decision on the subject of petitions addressee to it by the inhabitants of the Territory of the 3aar.     It was realised that auch peti-tionc, If allowed to come direct to tho Council, would im-pair the authority of tho Saar Government,   It was felt, on the other hand, that the Council ought to have knowledge of petitions addressed to the League.     It was accordingly decided that petitions should not bo addressed directly to tho Council by individuals requiring redress, but th.\\t they should in all esses bo addressed to the Saar Government, who, in turn, should forward it to the Council.
(3I    Eupon and Malmody.Undor Article 34 of the Treaty of Veraallies, the League is required to decide whother the transfer to Belgium of tho sovoroign-ty of Germany over the districts of Eupen end Maimedy shall he defini-tive.     The League is required to decide the question after the Belgian Government has communicated to it the result of a public expression of opinion held undor the auspices of tho Belgian autheri-ties, sM designed to give to the people of the districts an oppor-tunity to record their desire to see all or part&apos; of the territory in question remain under German sovereignty.During this public expression of opinion the German Government addressed to the President of the supreme Gouncil and to the Socre-tary-General of the League of Nations a scries of notes protesting that the Belgian Government was making it impossible for the people of Euoen and Maimedy freely to register their wishes.   The German Government proposed th.it a Commission should be appointed by the League of nations to supervise the   consultation   of the people in these districts-The Council of the League took the view that the League had no riant undor the Treaty to intervene in Eupon and Malmedy until tho Belgian Government had communicated the results of the consul-tation of the people, and until tho interval of six months pro-scribed by the Treaty had elapsed.The results of tho public expression of opinion were in duo course communicated to the Council by tho Belgian Government *   The council denidoc that&quot; tno arrangements made      thfi&quot;*Wl iap&quot;authorities&quot; for the public expression of opinion were in conformity with the spirit and letter of Article 24 of the Treaty of Versailles, and, after having considered tho German protests and the results reported by tho Belgian Government, definitively confirrae-&apos; the transfer of the districts to the sovereignty of Belgium.The Council/
The Council has also had to consider a protest from the-Germrr Government regarding an alleged breach of the Treaty of Versailles by the Delimitation Commission unarmed with fixing the frontier be-.fcW3en Germany and Belgium.   The Council did not feel competent to take any action in the matter.The Council decided that tho correspondence of the German Government with the Supreme Council and with the Secretary General of the League on these matters, together with the notes of the Belgian Government, &quot;should be published In the Official Journal of the League...(B)     GENERAL DUTIES Of&apos; THE LEAGUE IN THE INTERESTS OF PEACE AMD JUSTICE.(1) The Protection of Armenia.The Council of the League was notified by telegram on March 12 of a proposal put forward on behalf of the Supreme Council, that Armenia should be placed under the protection of the League of nations the Council of the League, in its reply to the Supreme Council, expressed warm desire to co-operate in the establishment of an Armenian Republic upon a safe and independent basis.   Xt was repre-sented, however, that the League was not a State; that it had no military or financial resources; and that the Covenant of the League did not contemplate the exercising of a Mandate by the League itself,The Council suggested that the future of the Armenian nation would best be assured if a Member of the League or some other Power could be found willing to accept a Mandate under Article 22.The Council offered to inquire whether any Member of the League would accept a Mandate for Armenia, provided the Supreme Council &quot;would assure to the Republic of Armenia the evacuation of the terri-tories assigned to it under the Treaty, secure to the Republic free access to the sea, and provide for the defence of Armenian territory until it could be assured by other means.   The Council of the Lea;r,,. further, o...,
^further asked the Supreme Council whether it would give a provisionalfinancial guarantee to the Independent Republic of Armenia on theunderstanding that the Council of the League would recommend theAssembly&apos;to put the finances of the Republic on a sound basis byguaranteeing a loan from all the States Members of the League.The Supreme Council subsequently informed the Council of theLeague that it was asking the President of the United States whetherthe United States of America would accept a Mandate for Armenia, andthat it was further inviting him to arbitrate on the boundaries be-tween Turkey and Armenia in the Vilayets of Erzerumj Trebizond, Vanand Bitlis, and on the question of the access of Armenia to the Sea.The Supreme Council undertook to communicate to tho Council ofthe League President Wilson&apos;s reply, and to consider the matter further in close consultation with the Council of the League.The Council of the League in a reply to this intimation of theSupreme Council on May 29th, said that it was well satisfied with thesolution of the Armenian problem suggested by the Supreme Council;but that, in the event of it being necessary to study the questionfurther, it would be happy to know that the Supreme Council was pre-pared to examine the points previously submitted in order&apos;that someether Power might be induced to accept a Mandate.   The Council of theLeague again declared that it was ready to do all in its power toassist the Supreme Council in assuring the inture security of Armenia ,On the 20th September the Council Instructed the secretary general to ask the Supreme Council whether it de&amp;required  the Council ofthe League&apos;to submit to the Assembly the proposals for assistingArmenia previously put forward, particularly as regards the financialguarantee to be furnished&apos; to Armenia by the Members vf the League,Meanwhile on May loth the President of the Armenian Delegation hadin Paris/informed the president  of the Council of the League of the Immediate danger to Armenia arising, from the attitude of Azerbaidjan and a hostile concentration of Turksih nationalist troops.   The Councl of the League decided that this,appeal should be forwarded to the Supreme Gouncil of the Allies..
t(2)   The Protection of Minor 1 ti^iaJ.h^0^.^,JS3&amp;S,^.,The Council received on May 19th a telegram from the President of the Council of Foreign Ministers and Ambassadors, forwarding for consideration a number of recommendations to the effect that the provisions of the Treaty of Peace with Turkey for the protection of Minorities in the Ottoman Empire should be placed under the guarantee of the League, and that the League should co-operate in their execution.The Treaty of Peace with Turkey provides, inter alia, for the appointment of mixed Commissions charged with important duties in con-nection with the indemnifying of persons belonging to the Turkish Minorities who have suffered in their persons or their property from measures authorised by the Turkish Government during the war.The Council of the League, in its reply to the Supreme. Council, said it was prepared to nominate qualified persons as Members of these Commissions, on the understanding that the Members so nominated would act under the control and responsibility of the high contracting parties to the Treaty.i The Council could make no definite declaration regarding the minority Clauses as a whole, or regarding their guarantee and execution, as at that time they had not been drafted in their final form.The question of the protection to be afforded the Turkish Minori-ties has since been the object of several communications between the representatives of the League and those in Charge of the Treaty.The Treaty with Turkey was signed/On April 10th, but has not yet been ratified&apos;.   It prescribes that the Allied Powers shall determine in agreement with the Council of the League the measures necessary to guarantee the execution of the Minority clauses&apos;.(5)   The frftteotion of MinOFrties in Poland. The Treaty between Poland and the Principal Allied and Associated powers, providing, inter alia, for the protection of persons belonging to racial, religious or linguistic Minorities, was ratified simul-taneously with the Treaty of Peace of Versailles,   Article 12 of this Treaty provides that the stipulations of Articles 1 to 11 constitute.n obligations
.18-Theobligations of. intermktonal^ concern, and that they shalL-come&quot; underxvhe guarantee of the League of Nations.The Council has noted its obligations and consented to guarantee the stipulations of Articles 1 to 11 so far as they affect persons belonging to racial^ religious or linguistic minorities.(4) ctlon of Minorities in Greece and Bulgaria.    &apos;Article 8 of the Treaty concluded on November 27, 1919, between Greece end Bulgaria concerning the reciprocal and voluntary emigration of ethnical&apos;i religious, or linguistic minorities in Greece and Bulgaria, (provides for the domination by the Council of the League of two Members I of a Mixed Commission entrusted with the execution of the Treaty.The Treaty was ratified on April 9, 1920.   On September 20, Ithe Council provisionally approved the nomination of two persons, nationals of States disinterestedin the questions with which the Commission will deal, and instructed its Acting President to take such [steps as were necessary for making final appointments.The Council, in taking this step, recalled a decision, reached [during its session in April, 1919, concerning the protection of minor-facilities in Turkey, and, in consenting to nominate the two members of the Mixed Commission, formally stated that, in the absence of any material means for enforcing a decision, it must be understood that the Members of the Commission would fulfil their duties under the author-jity and on behalf of Greece and Bulgaria.f5)   TpJj-151.L-L of-?ersia to the League.^ Persia, whose territory had been invaded by Soviet troops, demanded that the Council of the League should be summoned in sccord-fence with the provisions of Article 11.   The Persian Government asked or a meeting of the Council on May 29, and the Council assembled h June 14.The Council considered this appeal, not only with reference to Irticle 11, but alsC\with reference to Article 10 of the Covenant, [rider Article 10 &quot;the Members of the League undertake to respect and reserve as against external aggression the territorial integrity andI - It        T*bisting political independence of all Members of the&apos;League. In lase of such aggression, or threat or danger of it, the Council is p advise upon the means by which its obligation shall be fulfilled.
The Soviet forces were then established at T]nzeli, and were said to be pushing, forward into the interior.      Meanwhile, negotiations were proceeding between the Government of the Soviets&apos; and the Government of Persiaj   and Prince Flrouz. who sat as the Member for Persia on the Council while this matter was under dia-cusslon, was also in correspondence with the Government of the Soviets.     It was alleged in telegrams addressed by M( TchitcheMn. to the Persian Government and in representations to the British Government made by ivj. Krassin. who was then in London, that the Government of the Soviets desire 3. friendly relations with Persia, and that it had Issued orders for the withdrawal of the Soviet forces from Persian waters and Persian territory.The Persian Government was, when the Council met, waiting n reply from the Soviet Government to a telegram which had been sent to Moscow on June 12.     In this telegram Persia had asked for conditions of peace which would effectually re-establish her territorial integrity*The Council decided that, before advising further upon the means by which the obligations prescribed by the Covenant should be fulfilled, it should await the result of the negotiations then in progress between the Persian Government and the Soviet authorities.     It explicitly recognised that the Persian Government had acted in the best Interests of peace, find that It had rightlyappealed to the fundamental principle of co-operation   laid down by the Covenant.(6)   The Aaland^ Jsl^nds. The British Government requested that a special meeting of the Council should be summoned to consider the case of the Aaland Is lands *     The action of the British Government was based on
v    28the friendly right conferred on Members of the League by Article XI of the Covenant to bring to the attention of the&apos; Council any matter affecting international relations and threatening, to disturb the good undei standing between nations uoon which oea.ce depends. The case of the Aaland Islands then in dispute between Finland and Sweden aoneared to fail within the scone of the Article.The Council dealt &apos;&quot;ith the case under paragraph 4 of Artiole IV of the Covenant as a matter affecting the oeace of the world, and aoplied as closel^ as possible the nrincinles of Articles XII, XV and XVII,During the seventh and ninth   sessions of the Council&apos; at which the case was considered, M. Branting. the representative of Sweden, sat as a Member of the Council under Article IV of the Covenant,   M. Fnckell, the representative of Finland, also attended the Council with the consent of Sweden, though Finland was not yet a Member of the League.At the seventh session of the Council the two parties presented each their point of view and supported it with various arguments,Finland claimed that the case fell under paragraph   8 of Article 15 of the Covenant, and argued that the questions sub-mitted to the Council fell within the domestic jurisdiction of Finland and within the sphere of her sovereignty.   Sweden asked that a plebiscite should be held in the Islands *By the consent of both parties, delegates of the Aaland Islanders were admitted to present a declaration,,The Council observed that, if the Permanent Court of International Justice had already been established, the question whether the dispute between Finland and Sweden should be regarded as solely within the domestic jurisdiction of Finland under paragraph 8 of Article 16 of the Covenant would naturally have been referred to tha t 13*)dy ,To the absence of the Permanent Court, the Council decide! ,rith the consent of Sweden and Finland to ask for an opinion fvw-i a special Commission of three - International Jurists appointed ;To: -the purpose,-..-oe-
Tho Commission was asked to answer the two following questions(1) Doss the Swedish case as presented to the Council on the question of the Aaland Islands arise out of a matter which by international law is solely within the jurisdiction of Finland&quot; within the meaning of paragraph 8 of Article 15 of the Covenant?(2) What is the present state of the international obligations regarding the demilitarisation of the Aaland Islands?Meanwhile, the Council appealed to both parties to do all in their power during the consideration of the case by the Council not to oause any aggravation of the existing position, M. Brantlng publicly read a declaration engaging the Swedish Government to undertake nothing calculated to increase the existing tension, and M. TUnckell publicly stated that the Government of Finland would take into account the wishes expressed by the League of Nations.The Commission of Jurists sat from the 3rd of August to the 5th of September.     The conclusions of the Committee were as follows(a) The de facto position which led to the dispuoe between Sweden and Finland arose at a moment when Finland had not yet acquired the character of a definitely constituted State *    The dispute does not fall exclusively within the territorial sovereignty of Finland, and international law does not leave the question of the Aaland Islands to the exclusive compet-ence of Finland0     The Council of the League is com-potent to recommend any solution which it may regard as most equitable and expedient.(b) As regards the demilitarisation of the Aaland Islands the stipulations of the Convention and Treaty of Paris of 1856 are still in force.     Fach interested State accordingly has the right to claim respect for these stipulations and whoever possesses the Islands must conform to the obligations imposed by these stipulationse
The Council resumed tho examination of the question of the A.p.iftnd Is lands--during its-8th session held in Paris in September.The Council resolved on Sept-ember 20th that the question &quot;presented an international aspect , which brought its consideration within the competence of the League&quot; *     It laid stress on the duties imposed uoon It by Articles 11 and 4 of the Covenant -in the Interests of oeace between nations, and declared itself &quot;competent to make any recommendations which it mi $it deem just and proper in the case&quot;.It decided to appoint three delegates chirked with thew * Kit Wduty of &quot;furnishing the Council, in the shortest time required for the necessary consultations, and having regard to the legitimate Interests of all parties concerned, with a report which will enable it to frame a final or provisional settlement of the question and to establish conditions favourable to the maintenance of peace in that part of the world&apos;5 *The two parties accepted this procedure *   The represent-stive of Finland, however, criticised the report of the Jurists and made a formal statement to the effect that Finland reserved to herself the ri^ht to maintain that she possessed an exclusive competence to take a decision on the subject of a plebiscite in the Islands.The Council anticipated that, owing to the exceptional difficulty of the problem, a certain delay would be necessary before it we sin a position to rjive a definite decision, and it asked the Interested Governments to avoid  ivinm. any cause for public irritation in Sweden, Finland, or in -the Islandst so long as the question remained sub judice*The Council at the same time noted the special interest taken by Russia in the destiny of the Aaland Islands, and stated that it would naturally desire to hear the views of Russia on the subject, when she had emerged from the exceptional position In ^hich. she found herself.
(7)   Tho Lisjmte betwm Poland and Lithuania^Pl-lnw^apioha, tho Polish Minister for Foreign Affairs, informed the Council of tho League by telegram on September 5th that the Polish. Government Co j,ire a tho intervention of the Council in order to prevent war between Poland ...,nd Lithuania.      The Lithuanian Government, in conformity with Article 17 of tho Covenant, accepted for this dispute the obligations of a Member of the League and entrusted Professor WLdera&amp;r with full powers to give to tho Co-moil all necessary informations.     The Polish Government was represented V M. padorewjici.The polish representative stated that the danger of war arose from the presence of Lithuanian troops to the west of the provisional frontier assigned to Poland by the declaration of the Supreme Council of December 8th 1919.The Lithuanian representative said that Lithuania had no knowledge of the frontier fixed by the Supreme Council and that under a Treaty which it had concdudor- with the Government of the Soviets on July 12th, another frontier had been partially doterminod.     Under the Treaty with the Soviets this other, frontier was to have been completed by an agreement to be con-eluded, between Lithuania and Poland, and negotiations were pro-ceeding at iCalvarya for the conclusion of peace between the two countries upon a permanent basis.The Council was not asked to propose a final settlement of the dispute, but its immediate intervention appeared to be necessary in order to obtain a provisional acceptance by the two countries of a line of demarcation of the zones of occupation.The most important factor in the problem was the oresence within Lithuanian territory of troops of the Soviet Governmentsd?he Lithuanian representative stated that the Government of the Soviets was prepared, according to a telegram of M. Tchiteherin of September 5th, to evacuate tho whole of the terri-tory of Lithuania provided the Lithuanian Government could guarantee that the neutrality of Lithuania would be respected by Poland.
*     3 wActing upon these considerations the Council, by a resolu-tion adopted in Paris on Sopteiabor 20th, addressed an urgent appeal to the Governments of Lithuania and Poland to take immediately all necessary measures to prevent any hostile acts between their troops, snd tho representatives of Lithuania and Poland publicly undertook to recommend their Governments to act immediately in the 3enac desired.&apos;The Council further proposed that the two Governments should bind themselves by the following mutual undertakingsfl) The Lithuanian Government adopts as a provisional line of demarcation, reserving all its territorial rights, and awaiting the result of its direct negotiations with Poland, the frontier fixed by the Supreme Council of the Allies in its declaration of the 8th December 19ly, and undertakes to withdraw its troops from the territory to the west of this line:(.2) The Government of Poland undertook kes, reserving all its territorial rights, to respect during the war now in progress between Poland and the Government of the Soviets, t he-ceutrslity of the territory occupied by Lithuania to the east of the line of demarcation above specified, provided respect for this neutrality be also secured from the Soviet authorities by Lithuania.The Council declared thst it was ready to appoint a Commission entrusted with the duty of ensuring on the spot the strict observation by the interested parties of the obligations arising from their reciprocal undertakings.     The French, Spanish, and Japanese- representatives on the Council were instructed to receive the replies of the two Governments and to afford them any assistance they might require.The Lithuanian Government, in a telegram dated September gist, accepted the proposals of the Council.The Polish Government, on the other hand, complained on September 25th that the Lithuanian Government had refused to accept proposals for peace ^ut forward by the poles at Kalvarya.
The Polish Sovernawit further alleged that the Lithuanians were acting in co-operation with the Soviets and that it might not in these circumstances be able to respect the line of demaroa-tion suggested by the League.On the same date the Lithuanian delegate in Paris notified M. Bourgeois that on September  3rd the Polos had attacked tho Lithuanians along the whole of their front and that, crossing the line of demarcation, the Polos had advanced to places never before in their occupation.On september 27th, the Charge&apos; dvAffaires for Lithuania in London asked that the Council should at once be convened under Articles 11 and 17 of the Covenant to examine the position thus created.The Secretary General replied to this communication from tho Charge dTAffaires of Lithuania on September 30.     He said that the situation which had arisen was receiving the careful attention of the three Members of the Council who had been, authorised to deal with it.He further informed the Charge&apos; dTAffaires for Lithuania that the Members of the Commission entrusted with tbe fluty of ensuring on the spot the maintenance of peace had boon appointed, and that if in the opinion of the Commission the position became such as to require consideration by a full Session of the Council, the Commission would doubtless take the necossary stens to call the Council together.M. Bourgeois on u he same date called a meeting in Paris of the acting Representatives of the Council and the Hepresent-atives of Poland and Lithuania-     The acting representatives of the Council have iiept themselves continuously in t ouch with the representatives of the two CovernmontsoMeanwhile, the majority of the Members of the Commission appointed by the Council had already assembled on the spot and taken up their duties.
(8)   The appeal of the King of tho Ho&amp;5ae:.Tho King of tho Hedjaz addressed an appeal to the League in July against the arrest and imprisonment by tho yrench author-ities of certain Members of the Administrative Council of Lebanon. He asked that a Commission should bo sent to Lebanon to investigate the facts.Peace was not yet concluded between Turkey and the Allied Powers;   and Syria, by international law, was still part of an enemy country within whose territory there subsisted a state of war.     The Council hold the opinion that tho League had been created to maintain peaoe ;,fter peace had boon established by the Treaties, and it did not.fool itself called upon to inter-vene.The Council, therefore decided that it had no competence to deal with the matter, and forwarded   the appeal to the French Government, abstaining -from any comment on its merits.(C)   SPECIAL LUTILS ACCEPTED BY TRU LhAOLTB.(1)   The Despatch of a Commission of Inouiry to Russia.The International Labour Organisation had decided to send a Commission of Investigation to Russia to examine the.labour position in that country.    The Supreme Council thought it would be opportune to orgnise a more extensive inquiry into the con-ditions then prevailing in ftuosia under the supervision of the Council of the League..    The Supreme Council requester&apos; the Council of the League to take charge of the matter \nd the Council considered this request on March IE.The Counoil decided to ask the Government of the Soviets whether they were prepare&apos;1 to give to the proposed Commission of Inquiry the necessary facilities for their work.     Meanwhile, the Secretary-General was authorised to assist in the organisation of the Commission and of the Secretariat of the Commission.The Soviet Government, in a wireless message dated May 10, agreed in principle to the admission into Russia of a delegation of the League,   but alleged that it oould not for military reasons admit at that time any delegation among the members of whioh
there wore representatives of nations actively,..supporting Poland in tho Ukraine.In a further telegram despatched from Moscow, on May 25, M. Ichitcbsrln accused the League of having allowed, full liberty to one of its Members, namely Poland, to attack Russia in the Ukraine.     He further drew attention to the attitude of other Members of the League who were assisting Poland by sending war material and military instructors.     His message (which was incompletely transmitted) concluded, so far as could be ascertained, with a statement that for reason of national security it was impossible for the government of the Soviets to send a favourable answer to the request of the Council.The Council of&apos; the League finally decided that these communications amounted to a refusal on the part of the Russian Government to receive the Commission of Inquiry, and the project was abandoned.(2)   ffho Internstional Finanoial Conference.The decision to hold an International Financial Conference under the auspices of the League was taisn at the second session of the Council, on Fab *uary liith.    The object of the Conference was to study the present internstional   -Financial position, and to discuss remedies.
It was decided that tho Conference should be convened by a- Committee composed of Members of the Council nominated by the Pr c side&apos; nt &apos; o f the C o u r.c 11 ;;or t he t irne bo i ng. It \.r\s hoped that the Conference would be able to meet in May.The preparations for the Conference were entrusted to a Committee of Organisation presided over by U* Jean Iviomiot, Dep .ty ,ocretary General o.: the League.     m;, Monuet has acted for the Secretary-General in all natters relating to the ifinauaial Conference.     The Gounc.il sub-sequent ly appointed Mc Gustav&amp;a Ador, president of the Conference.Invitations wore issued to 87 Members of the League.   The Governments of Luxembourg, Finland, Botnonia   Latvia and Lithuania were also invited to ss.&quot;iu delegates to taice port in the discussion, when mattors cone em lug their countries were before the Confer saca-     The United Stakes Government was invited to participate In the work of the Conference.It was throughout realised that the Conference could not deal adequately with the existing financial situation unless Germany and her late Allies were represented.     Invitations were issued to ana accented by the Governments of Germany and Austria. An invitation was also addressed to Bulgaria.It vms further realised that it would be necessary for the Ccnfeianeo to have exact information on the financial obligations of Germany under
under the   Treaty cf Versailles.   In this connection it should&apos; do notod that the Reparations Commission wasunder the Treaty of Versailles.     In this connection it should he ntted that tho Reparations Commission was invited to send a representativeM. Bourgeois, who acted on behalf of the Council in all matters relating to the financial Conference, endeavoured from the first to impress upon the Supremo Council the importance of coming to an early decision rog-arding the German indemnity. It was hoped that tho Conference at Spa would bo able to notify the Council of the League of its decisions in time for the Conference, which has already been repeatedly postponed, to be held on July S3.On July 14th, however, M. Delacroix, President cf the Supreme Oouna.il at Spa, informed M. Bourgeois that the Supreme Council was unable to givo to the Council of the League any useful or preoiso indications as to the decisions which vvould be taken by the Allies in regard to the German indemnity. M. Delacroix, subsequently telegraphed t* Mr, B&amp;balfour, asking the League of Nations to postpone tho International Pinanoial Conference until after September 15.The Supreme Council, in requesting this postponement, ex-pressed the hope that it would be able to furnish the Council of the League before September 15th with the information required.The Council of the League during its eighth Session at San Sebastian decided that the Conference should, in any event, be held on September 25th,     It was decided that, if before that date the Supremo Couneil had failed to notify the Council of the League of its decisions, the Conference should be instructed to tontine itself to. questions whieh wore unrelated to the German indemnity,M. Bourgeois had prepared a list of agenda for the Conferanee from which all questions relating to the German indemnity had been omitted, and ha proposed that the President of the Conference should be instructed not to go beyond thelimits
limits of tills restricted list.     It was undorsto-od. that if &quot;before the opening of the Conference tho Supreme Council had communicated its decisions, the Conference might be notified of them and the President of tho Conference might t,ake them into account in dealing with the agenda oi the Conference and the method of its work&apos;.Meanwhile the German Government was warned that the President of the Conference had instructions from the Council of the League to exclude from deliberations all questions still under discussion between Germany and the Allies.The&apos;Financial Conference began its work in Brussols on September 25th.ACTION OF THE LEAGUE IN TEE GEKblBAL DTORSSTS OF EUMLaHITY. (1) The Campaign agalrst Typhus^,in .P,p3,aM*The Council during its 3rd Session adopted a resolution asking the International Health Conference, which was t^ meet in London towards the end of April, to submit to it plans of united official action for the protection of Poland and other countries lying to the west of Russia from the epidemic of typhus.The Health Conference recommended that the Council of the League should appoint an Executive Commission to work in co-operation with the Polish authorities and the authorities of the countries likely to possess surplus materials, and with the League of Red Cross Societies.Acting on these recommendations, tho Council of the League appointed Mr * ICenyon vaughan Morgan to be Chief Commissioner for the Jieague, and Dr. Norman White to be Medical Commissioner for the collection, organisation and despatch of the necessary hospital units and staff.     The Seorotary General was authorised to make any nominations which might be necessary to complete the Executive Committee,After an investigation made on the spot by Dr.Norman White, the League Commissioners drafted a plan of co-operation with the Polish Ministry of Health and the Red Cross Societies.-30- The
The Jjondon Conference stated that the campaign would have 3 to be financed by the Governments * and not by tho Rod Crops Societies, whoso moans wore limited.     The total coot of the campaign was estimated at 3f million sterlingsThe Council dooidod that it would try to raiso 2 million sterling from the Governments and make a further appeal to private generosity through the League of Rod Cress Societies.The Socretary-Ceneral was authorised to appeal at once to tho Governments of 28 States for contributions towards the  2,000,000 required, and Mr. Balfour, who was the representa-tivo on tho Council entrusted with this appeal on behalf of the League, endeavoured to obtain  250,000 for immediate use.. He secured from the British Government a promise to contribute  50,000 to this preliminary sum; provided four other Powers were also prepared to respond,   Mr, Balfour thereupon appealed to the Governments of $ranee, Italy, Japan    Spain and tho Netherlands*     France replied that she woul  contribute on the same conditions as Great Britain, but at ijhe time of the Council meeting at San Sebastian no further uefinito eontri-butions to the preliminary sum of  250,000 had been promised by the States addressed.Dr* vaughan Morgan has resigned the post of High Commissioner for tho League in the absence of tho funds, necessary to start the campaign, and the Council has asked Dr, Norman White to accept the post of Acting High Commissioner in his place*The Council has since been informed that there is serious danger of a greatly Increased epidemic of typhus intho
the autumn,Mr. Balfour lue accordingly undertaken to make a further appeal to tho Governments, anr! has ursrod his colleagues on tho Oouneil to do all in their power to make his appeal successful.     Offers of contributions to the general fund of  2,000,000 have boon, received from Belgium ( 1,000), Greece ( 10,000), Canada ($300,000), Persia ( 2,000) and Siam( 1,000),     Poland has intimated that the annual credit of 800,000 merles allotted in the Polish budget to the campaign arc3inst Typhus must be considered as the contribution ox Poland.     Austria has offered 100,000 crowns, and Germany a Million paper Marks * Germany stipulates that German experts be associated with the work of the Executive Committee.     The Council has replied that it would hardly be possible to appoint to the Executive Committee the representative of any country not a Member of tho League.(2)     Re3.i0f in 0entral ffurop0.On February 24 the Acting President of the Council addressed a letter to the President, of tho International league ox Red Cross Societies, urging it to organise an effort to deal with the ravages inilieted by disease upon the underfed populations of Central Suropo.The -wearuc of Hod Cross Societies,- in reply, said it was impossible for them to take up the matter until the Governments of the world had found the means to provide the necessary foodstuffs/clothing
olothing and means of transport, but that they would prepare plans for the further development of relief in Central Europe, and address a general appeal to ell the nations of the world for the necessary materials, personnel and funds upon receiving an assurance from the League that the Governments of the world were prepared to render them the necessary assistance *The Council of the League considered that, in view of the measures ta^en by the governments represented on the Inter-national Committee for Relief Credits to assist the countries in question through the agency of this Committee, it might safely assure the Red Cross Societies that there would be sufficient material available for carrying out the work which the Council had invited them to undertake.A letter was accordingly addressed to the League of Red Gross Societies, expressing a hope that they would proceed with their plan and issue their appeal.(3)   Rejnstriation of War Prisoners.to February&apos;?, the Supreme Economic Council passed aEesolution inviting the Council of the League to take measures for the assistance of prisoners of war in the territories underthe sovereignty of the Government of the Soviets.     Efforts todeal with the matter had already been made by various private and public bodies, notably by the International Committee ofthe Red Cross, the Red Cross Societies of Scandinavia, theAmerican Bed Crtss Society, r-nd the American Young Men&apos;sChristian Association.In spite of these efforts, there still remained some500,000 prisoners of war in Europe and Asia to be repatriated.In many o-iaes these prisoners had been absent from their homes for from four to six years, ond were suffering severe hardship.    Itwas calculated that there were some  50,000 prisoners in Russiaand
and Siberia belonging to Central Europe.Tho Council during its 4th Session at Paris decided that Dr. Nansan shnuld be invited to act on behalf of the Council of tho Leagues     lie was authorised to negotiate With the Governments interested, to co-ordinate the efforts of tho existing organisations4 &apos; nri to prepare plans.   He was furthor invited to submit recommendations regarding the financial credits required for the work.Dr. Mansen immediately beftan negotiations with theGerman Government, with tho Government of the Soviets, and with all the Governments interested.   He out himself in touch with the voluntary organisations which had hitherto been dealing wit 1 the question, ana in particular with the International Committee of the Red Cross,Dr. Nansen reported to the Council on the progress of his work during its 6th Session held in London.   Ha described in particular the arrangements which he had successfully made for the repatriation of prisoners through Narva and Bjorko across the Baltic.   Ho stated that ho hoped to repatrieto some 60,000 prisoners over the Baltic before the winter.Dr. Nansen also arranged for a scheme of repatriation through Vladivostok under an agreement which had been madebe-tween the Gor.ee.a Government end tho - Government of the Soviets xor en exchange of Russian prisoners in Germany against prisoners belonging to the Central mrpiros in Siberia.   Ho also hoped to open another route for repatriation &quot;over the Black Sea for prisoners in Turkestan.It would have ta.cen some considerable time to raise money by private subscriptions to finance the work he had undertakenDr. Nansen haid therefore addressed himself to the International, iOomnittee of Belief Credits in Paris and to tho governments represented on this Committee in the hope of obtaining iwModlateadvances.     He asned the League for its meal support In thonegotiations
negotiations ho was pursuing with the various Governments, andin tho. appeal which he proposed to tusko ::*or private subscriptions,5?ha Council addressed letters to the Governments ofSsthonia and Finland, and to the President of the international committee of tho Hod Cross, thanking thorn for the services theyhad rendered, rad sent a further letter to til the Governmentsconcerned aB inL, them to allow the necessary transit facilities-The Council also endorsed tho appeal of Dr. Hanson to.theGovernments on the international Committee of Belief Credits.Most of the Governments addressed have allocated funds Cor repatriation through the,Committee of Relief Credits.Denmark has allotted  35,000;   iiorway  35,000;   the Netherlands 45,000;   the United Xin^dom  113,000;   Sweden  35,000;Switzerland  48,000.   France has vromised  115,000 subjectto certain conditions.   Italy hopes to contribute  86,000.The Netherlands and the United Kingdom have promised to furnishsupplementary contributions of  10,000 and  113,000 respectivelywhen the credits allotted by the various Governments through theRelief Credits Committee have reached the total of  635,000(the supplementary contributions included).   Dr. iJanaen was thus,enabled to proceed with his arrangements.   He estimated thattho schemes of repatriation actually being carried out would,cost some  850,000.   He hopes to obtain- from private sources   ,.the balance necessary to bri% tho sura obtained from thoGovernments up to the total  850,000 required.Dr. Nansen ftgg 84cl?38gQ&amp; sn aopoal Cor private subscriptions to tho American Young Men&apos;8 Christian Association, tho British Red Cross, end the American Red Cross.   $1,500,Q00 had already been collected in.America.During its 6th Session, the Council received an appeal from; Count wrau^el, who was rooxorenting aux^ariau interests inLondon
London, concerning the c conditions of the Bulgarian prisoners in Greece and Sorbla,     The Council authorised Dr. Nansen to make an unofficial enquiry into the facts, and to take any measures which, appeared to him. to be necessary.    In consequence of Dr. Nanson&apos;s representations satisfactory arranr-y-nonts were made by the tvro Governments for a settle-men t of the question,IV,HHL?. GIVFK LY TI-&quot;- VyMW TO AfiSOCI.

ft.45province of the League itself, and have had to be undertaken by the Secretariat at increased cost and labour.     The Council at the same time paid a&apos; tribute to the value of the work achieved by the Union of International Associations, and expressed full sympathy with its objects.During its Session at Rome, the Council decided to send to the Conference of the Federation of National Associations in support of the League of Nations, which was to be held at Milan In the autumn of 1920, a message of sympathy and encouragement*
