CO?.!! &quot;ITT5B OK TOLANT.1 tSECOND CHi\MB^RS.The Committee on Ireland have adopted generally the proposals in the attached Memorandum with regard to Second Chambers in Southern Ireland and Northern Ireland subjeot to the following provision viz.,   Whether the Bill should provide for a Second Chamber in the Parliament cf Northern Ireland as well as in the Parliament of Southern Ireland!     This question the Committee consider oan only be decided by the Cabinet.A suggestion was made by Sir L. Worthington-Kvang that it should be left to the House of Commons of Northern Ireland to decide whether a Second Chamber should be added to that Parliament and a Draft Amendment to carry out this suggestion is attached.Subject to the derision of the foregoing question the Committee approved of the Draff Provisions for the establishment of 2nd Chambers,ft     ;    t     r     A     ft     B     (2 Whitehall Gardens,  S,W,1, 3rd November, 1920,

Greer).in committee on the Government of Ireland Bill the x principle of second chambers in the parliaments of Southern Ireland and Northern Ireland was accepted on behalf of the Government, and an undertaking given that before the report stage the necessary amendments for the purpose would be placed on the paper (see official Report, 18th May ocl263-1277).The committee on Ireland have provisionally decided that the senates should be constituted on the same lines as the senate of Ireland proposed by the Irish Convention, and directed that a memorandum and amendments should be prepared on the subject for further consideration.I.Composition of senates-1.     The Convention&apos;s scheme for a senate in &quot;the Irish parliament is appended hereto.   It is devised not so much with a view to protecting the minority as of securing representation of interests not likely to be represented adequately in the House of Commons.The convention recommended that the senate should consist of sixty-four members-   Of these four were to be I      ex-officio members; viz., the Lord chancellor cf Ireland M      and the Lord Mayors of Lublin, Belfast and cork.   Elevenwere to be nominated by the Lord Lieutenant and the remainder were to be representatives of various interests and classes.

T(abour ..... .... . i ..........................   4^&quot; Learned institutes (included in the eleven members to be nominated by the lord lieutenant) ........ *......:................   3The Convention did not give any indication as to the manner in which the representatives of the various interests were to be chosen, and, in the constitution of so important a body as a second Legislative chamber, this is not a matter 7/hich could be left at large.There is no recognised association or body representing such interests as commerce and industry or labour,-or even the county councils, resident peers or archbishops and bishops in which the right of electing representatives could be vested by the Bill, and even if there were, it would
be riftc^smary to prescribe regulations for tho elections,a course which, in the case of some of the bodies at any rate, would hardly be practicable,   it would seem to fclloV therefore that the appointed! of such representatives must be given to the lord Lieutenant, the Bill merely specifying the respective numbers and directing that reoommendatlons ef any representative associations or bodies are to be attended to.   if the senates are to be safeguax-dir-for-^he re&amp;p&amp;cti-vs minorities, it would be necessary to provide that the appoints merits are to he made by the Lord Lieutenant, subject to in-Btructions from His Majesty, otherwise they would &quot;be made on the advice of the Ministers of Southern or northern Ireland. It would -appearto--^e-^u.oot5si3ary- to reproduce the C-onvention&apos;^--re^xamemdati on of four P^ivy Councillors of two years * staioding and four other persons to be appointed by him; and as regards ex-officio members, the Lord Ohancollor can hardly be retained as an ex-officio member of both or either   senates; first, because of hi3 judicial duties as president of the High court of Appeal; and, secondly, because he may probably be nominated president, of the Council of Ireland.   The ex-off icio Lord Mayors should probably be replaced on the Northern senate by representatives of the two northern-county borough councils, Belfast and Londonderry, and on the Southern senate by representatives of the four southern county borough councils, Dublin, Cork, Limerick-and Waterford. 2.     The number of members of each senate requires considera-tion.   If there are to be joint sittings sf the two Houses in the event of disagreement, it would seem on the precedents that the number of members in the Second chamber should be about one-half as a maximum to about one-fourth as a minimum af^h^^ffifcervaiVme^^ Under the
convention&apos;- o-chew-^w^mKlbsa^-crf&quot;member&apos; of the Jirtrt^haaiber was to be eventually one hundred and sixty, and the number of the second chamber was then to be Increased J^ryon-d sixty-four,   in the Act cf 1914 the respective members are one hundred and sixty four and forty.Apart from the question of joint -sittings, the number would be determined by the number of interests to be repre-sented, consideration of efficiency and the number of suitable persons available for the office,   It should be borne in mind that, when the one hundred and twenty-eight members of the Southern House of Commons, the fifty-two members of the northern House of Commons, and the (possible) twenty outside members of the council are eliminated, no very large supply of eligible representative men will be left,   possibly a senate of about forty in Southern Ireland and about twenty in northern Ireland would be most satisfactory. 3.    one of the most delicate matters in the composition of the two senates is the representation to be given to the clergy.   The following table shows the numerical strength of the leading denominations J-Roman        Church of    pre by    Metho-    Other C^atlTollc     irelancT      Ten an&quot;   dietSouthern Ireland. 2,8l2,5y$ 249,535 45,486 16,440 1^,718 northern Ireland 430,161 327,076 395,039 45,942 52,313 Ireland 3,242,570   576,611      440,525     62,382   08,031in southern Ireland the Roman Catholic Church predominates; next comes the Church of Ireland, and,, in point of number, the ethers are relatively significant.   It would seem therefore that in the southern senate three members might be assigned to the Roman catholic- clergy and two to the Church of Ireland Clergy,
In Northern Ireland the Roman Catholic Church ranks first in numbers, the Prebytefian Church second, and tho Church of Ireland third.     The three would be entitled to representation, and ths difference in numbers is hardly sufficient to justify any discrimination in the number of representatives to be given to each on a senate of twenty, and it is accordingly sugg*stoc? that there should be one representative for each.It is asstvseo1 that the representation should bo given to the clergy of the respective denominations;   first,, because this follows the principle of the Convention^ rocos-mondation-: and, secondly, because the clergy of the Church of Rome and (probably) those of the Church of Ireland aro disqualified   &apos; for membership of either house of Commons,.    A draft provision for the constitution of the senates Is annexed. /! .    Whether the Convention scheme is or is not adopted as the basis, it is submitted that tho same principleo oust be -applied to each senate.     The draft is intended to adhere to the principles on which tho Convention scheme was framedt but, as that was a scheme for a senate of a Parliament of the whole of Ireland, adjustments must be made in adapting it to the case of separate Parliaments for separate parts of Ireland the majority in one part being the minority in tho other.IIDisagreements between the two Houses, 5.   It is for consideration whether a provision should be inserted for a loint sitting of the two Houses on a disagree-raent, on the linos of section 11 of the Act of 1914 which follows section 35 of the South Africa Act.     It provides that if there is a disagreement on a bill in one session and the House of Commons pass the Bill again in the next session
and a dio agreement again arises, then there is to he a joint sitting of the two Housoe.     If the protection of tho minority is the main purpose of the sen&apos;..to, then its efficacy, in --outhorn Ireland at any rate, would he much impaired by the &apos;nmention of such a provision^     On the other hand, the absence of any machinery for settling a disagreement between a nominated and a representative chamber might produce a deadlock with most unfortunate consoquonces,     There is no provision for joint sittings in the Canadian ;:ct.     In the Australian Commonwealth the joint sitting is not held unless tho -Hill has been passed throe times by the Lower House., and there must bo an interval cf at least three months between the first and second disagreement and a dissolution must intervene between&apos; the -second and third disagre rniont. (s .57)IIIiionoy Hills.Presumably provisions corresponding to sub-sections (l) (o) and (4) of section 10 of the Act of 1014 should be inserted in the Bill.     They define the relations between the two Houses on money Bills and money clauses, providing that money Bills must originate in the House of Commons, the senate may not reject a money Bill and may not amend -money clauses or increase nublie charges.There are similar provisions in the Australian and South Africa Acts (as.53&quot;and CO)SThe Contention rocommended a modification to enable the senate to^suggest amendments to money Bills, but no express provision for this purpose seems necessary.     The senate could proceed in the same way as the House of Lords proceeds in the case of privileged amendments.
jtfpir. irta i ion o f U em fco.tR o f t ho 0 o u.n e i 1 cf Irs land.7.     Under the Bill each House of Commons is to nominate twenty of the forty-one members of the Council of Ireland, and the question arises whether the right of nominating any of the.twenty shall be transferred to the senate.The Council is to initiate suggestion for the delegation to it of the powers of the two Parliaments, and there is no doubt that, if nominees of the senates were place I upon the Council, this might introduce a leaven of moderate men who would woric for the united action and ultimately for u.:io.n.   On the other hand, effective steps towards union.can be ta*cen only by the Parliaments themselves, end the admission to the Council of a new element nominated by an authority independent of the two Houses of Commons and electorates would tend to increase the suspicion with which the Council is regarded, and would diminish its efficacy as a bridge between the Parlia-ments.Iz.Term cf Office.6. .  The term of office of senators is five years,under thoAct r  1914, six years in the Australian parliament, tenyears in the South African Parliament, and for life in theCanadian Parliament.   The Convention apparently accepted the five years of the Act of 1914, although a suggestion for a term of seven years was made by a sub-committoe.
