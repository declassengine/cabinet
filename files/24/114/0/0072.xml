PART L THE LABOUR SITUATION.THE GENERAL SITUATION.General Survey of the Week.The formal negotiations between the Government and the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain, which re-opened on the 24th October, concluded on the 28th in a provi-sional agreement, details of which are given below. * During the week this provisional agreement has been submitted to a ballot vote of the members of the Miners&apos; Federation. The result was communicated to the National Delegate Conference of the Federation on the 3rd November. A majority of 8,459 against acceptance was shown, on a total vote of 684,549, and the Delegate Conference determined to end the strike and to advise the men to resume work on the 4th November, or as soon after as possible.This ballot vote is the third taken by the Miners&apos; Federation during the course of the negotiations on their &quot;wages and prices demand,&quot; originally put forward on the 7th July. It is distinguished from the second ballot by the fact that acceptance of the terms of settlement was recommended by the National Executive. In the previous ballot no such recommendation was issued, and the various counties and districts were each left to determine their own course. In this instance, only two of the constituent bodies of the Federation have given recommendations definitely opposed to that of the National Executive, namely, the Delegate Conferences of the South Wales Miners&apos; Federation and of the Lancashire and Cheshire Miners&apos; Federation. The influence of the local delegate bodies is shown by the overwhelming majorities in South Wales and Lancashire against acceptance of the provisional agreement.The provisional agreement of the 28th October naturally suspended the activities of the other national bodies of organised labour with regard to the coal miners&apos; dispute. The special conference of trade union executives summoned by the Parliamentary Com-mittee of the Trades Union Congress, which met on the 27th October, adjourned inde-definitely omthe 28th October, and will probably not be called together again. The General Meeting of the National Union of Eailwaymen met on the 29th October, adopted a resolu-tion recommending the miners to confirm the provisional agreement, and adjourned until the result of the miners&apos; ballot should be known. Details are given below of the effect of the coal strike upon the unemployment position as shown by returns from Employment Exchanges.The course of events connected with the coal strike has been the principal item of interest in the week. The most recent Government proposals for the employment of ex-Service men on the housing schemes have again been considered by the National Federation of Building Trades Operatives, but no decision has yet been taken. The preparations being made by local authorities for the relief of unemployment during the winter continue to be widely reported. Attention, however, has been drawn for the moment from the general unemployment position to the difficulties which may arise on the coming into operation on the 8th November of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920, and the cessation on the 6th November of the third special extension of out-of-work donation.The Emergency Powers Bill, which was introduced in the House of Commons by the Secretary of State for Home Affairs on the 22nd October, passed the House of Commons on the 27th, and received the Eoyal Assent on the 29th. The Shops (Early Closing) (No. 2) Bill passed the House of Commons on the 1st November, and on the same day the Women and Young Persons (Employment in Lead Processes) Bill received its second reading in that House without a division, and with little opposition.The Unemployment Position.The Coal Strike and Unemployment. returns   Icollected through the lEmployment Exchange organisation show that, on the 8th October, 244,729 out-of-work donation* See p. 534 below,
FEATURES OF THE WEEK.General Topics.Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920. The Sheffield branch of the National Union of General Workers discussed the Act at a meeting on the 25th October. The provision which forbids the payment of benefit to men who, although not participating in a dispute at a works, are unemployed as a result of it, was strongly criticised. A resolution was carried endorsing the union&apos;s policy in deciding to admimster the Act, and calling on the Labour Party to press for the deletion of the offending sub-section relating to trade disputes. At a mass meeting of the United Ladies&apos; Tailors&apos; Trade Union last week it was resolved that Jewish workers should immediately set up an Association under Section 17 of the Act.The position of persons not previously insured against unemployment who may be unemployed between the 8th November and the 6th December is attracting attention.Relief of Unemployment (London). The position with regard to unemployment in London, and the scheme for the employment of men on arterial roadways were discussed on the 1st November at a meeting between the members of the House of Commons, of all parties, representing London constituencies and 15 Mayors of London boroughs. The chairman, Mr. J. D. Gilbert, M.P., promised that the question of providing relief should have the close attention of the members, and a meeting has been called for the 4th November to consider the matter. The Woolwich Borough Council have already prepared a plan for work on an arterial road at Eltham, and expect to employ at least 200 men on this work in the near future. A deputation from this Council to the War Office, to protest against the decision to discharge all workmen in the Arsenal and other Government works at Woolwich at the age of 60, instead of 65, resulted in an agreement to suspend the discharges for a month.Industrial and Other Organisations.Trades Union Congress : Labour General Council. It is understood that considerable progress has been made with the preparations for giving effect to the decision of the Ports-mouth Congress to set up a General Council in place of the Parliamentary Committee. The preliminary work in connection with the grouping system is now practically completed, and the setting up of sub-groups will be undertaken when the main groups have been established and the necessary officials appointed.National Federation of Building Trades Operatives. In connection with the Govern-ment proposals for the introduction of ex-Service men into the building industry the Emergency Committee of this Federation met in London on the 2nd November, to consider the reply of the Government to the resolution passed at the special conference at Man-chester on the 26th October. This resolution requested the Government to state imme-diately what guarantee they would offer in return for the suspension of trade union rules necessarily involved in the proposals.* It is understood that the reply took the form of(jj 16594)3 Y2The General Situation-continued.policies and unemployment books were lodged at the Exchanges in England and Wales. On the 2nd November the total was 437,480, and on the 3rd November, 443,058. The increase is most marked in the Wales and Yorkshire and East Midlands Divisions, where the total on the 8th October was more than trebled on the 3rd November. The total in Scotland stood at 19,656 on the 8th October, and at 35,065 on the 3rd November.Returns, classified by industry, for the 3rd November show &quot;that, so far as reported, 95,275 discharges were due to the entire closure of works and 147,570 to reduction in staff, giving a total of 242,845. In addition, 347,722 workers had been placed on short time. The industries mainly affected were iron and steel manufacture, which accounted for 125,256 discharges, the textile industry, which accounted for 33,788 discharges and nearly half of the short-time working, and the shipbuilding and engineering industries, with 48,957 workers discharged.A detailed analysis of the unemployment position on the 22nd October will be found on page 543.
an invitation to a joint conference between representatives of the Federation and the Government, to take place on the 3rd November. No statement was issued by the committee at the close of the meeting on the 2nd, but a meeting took place between the Minister of Labour, the Minister of Health and representatives of the Federation.United Textile Factory Workers&apos; Association-Tine proposals for the closer federation of all trade unions in the cotton textile industry, outlined at the annual conference of the association in July,* were approved at a meeting of the Lancashire Cotton Weavers&apos; Amalgamation in Manchester on the 9th October. The Amalgamated Association of Operative Cotton Spinners and Twiners, who would have been one of the three largest unions in the proposed new federation, have, however, refused to participate in the scheme, as have also the Amalgamated Association of Card and Blowing Room Operatives, who rejected it by an almost unanimous vote at a meeting on the 23rd October. The reason for the two unions&apos; action appears to be their fear that the proposed federation would have a prejudicial effect upon their industrial power &apos;The scheme proposes that each affiliated organisation shall continue their own work and carry out their own domestic policy, but that the scope of the Association should be &quot; extended so as to include industrial and political questions.&quot; Their main objects are &quot; to secure the best terms and conditions of employment for the workpeople employed in the various sections of the cotton trade, to support Labour representation in Parliament, and to promote Labour legislation on any other object which may receive the sanction and support of the General Council.&apos;&quot; It is proposed to meet the working expenses by means of levies on the affiliated organisations, leaving each body to find their own strike and lock-out pay.At the annual conference it was agreed that the scheme should be submitted to the members of the organisations concerned before any decision was arrived at, and a special conference was called for the 13th November, when the organisations, having had time to consider the matter, will give their final vote. In view of the opposition of the spinners and cardroom operatives, it does not seem probable that the scheme will be adopted in its present form.The unions affiliated to the United Textile Factory Workers&apos; Association are the Amalgamated Association of Operative Cotton Spinners and Twiners; the Amalgamated Association of Eeamers, Twisters and Drawers (Hand and Machine); the General Union of Associations of Loom Overlookers; the Operative Bleachers, Dyers and Finishers&apos; Association; the Amalgamated Association of Card and Blowing Room Operatives; and the Lancashire Cotton Weavers&apos; Amalgamation.National Union of Boot and Shoe Operatives. The October monthly report of this union states that it is proposed to ask the branches to deal with the problem of members who may not be discharged from employment, but who, nevertheless, are suspended from employment from day to day. It is suggested that in future any member without employ-ment for 12 consecutive working days shall be entitled to out-of-work benefit payment, to count from the first day of unemployment. The usual holiday periods will be excluded. Branches are asked to take a vote on this proposal at their meetings, by show of hands, and to inform the general secretary of the result not later than the 14th November, so that instructions for the inauguration of the new scheme may be sent to the branches at the earliest opportunity.  The matter will again come up for consideration in December.It is also stated in the report that 7,984 members signed the out-of-work, books for the past month, and that the amount of benefit paid during the month exceeded  10,000, bringing the total for the last 12 weeks to more than  30,000.The previous &quot; special suspension &quot; scheme inaugurated by this union to meet the needs of suspended, as opposed to discharged, members operated from the 21st June to the 26th September. It will be remembered that the union complained that the arrangement, which some employers adopted, of suspending their workpeople, in turn, for a week at a time, put an undue strain upon the out-of-work fund of the union, thus thrown open to almost all suspended members. The special scheme outlined above is intended to meet the same need as the previous scheme, but its detailed provisions are clearly drafted so as to prevent those members who may be suspended on the system of alternate weekly &quot; suspensions being eligible for the special benefit.Labour Co-partnership Association. A congress to discuss the principle of co-partner-ship in industry was held in London under the auspices of the Labour Co-partnership Associa-tion on the 26th, 27th and 28th October.  Lord Robert Cecil took the chair at the first
day&apos;s session. The chief speakers were Lord Robert Cecil, Lord Emmott, Lord Salisbury, Sir George Gihb, Sir George Paish, Mr. J. H. Whitley, M.P., Mr. G. J. Wardle, Mr. B. 0. Greening, Mr. Henry Vivian, Dr. Carpenter, and Mr. Aneurin Williams. The following resolution was passed: &quot; That in the opinion of this congress all possible means should be taken to advance the adoption of co-partnership in industry ; and in particular it recommends-&quot; (1) That legislation should be immediately passed removing from all statutory and other companies any legal obstacles that may exist in the way of its adoption.&quot; (2) That a special department of the Board of Trade, the Ministry of Agriculture, or the Ministry of Labour, should be constituted to study the practical aspects of the question in con-. nection with the various industries of the country, so that, where opportunity offers, recom-mendations can be made for the best scheme of co-partnership to be adopted in any particular case.&quot; (3) That a committee consisting of persons conversant with the trade union movement be appointed by the Labour Co-partnership Association, to consider what steps should be taken in the adoption of any co-partnership scheme to secure the hearty co-operation of trade unionists.&quot;Lord Robert Cecil pointed out in his speech that the object of the association was to promote co-partnership in every sense, and not merely to advocate the adoption of profit-sharing schemes. Mr. Wardle stated that trade unions generally were known to be hostile to profit-sharing undertakings, and would insist upon a share of power as well as of respon-sibility before they would agree to take part in any joint schemes which might be formulated.Trade Union Topics.Amalgamated Engineering Union. The final nominations for the election of a general secretary to succeed Mr. Tom Mann, who will retire under the age-limit rule of the union next July, have now been received. The nominees number 32, and include Messrs. W. H. Hutchinson, Sam Bradley, Arthur MacManus, W. McLaine and W. E. Watson. The first ballot will be returnable to headquarters by the 5th January, and a second ballot will then be taken to decide which of the two candidates receiving the highest number of votes shall be appointed, unless any one candidate has a clear majority over all the rest.Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen. A change in the constitution of this society is suggested by the general secretary in the November issue of the Locomotive Journal.  Mr. Bromley suggests that the District Councils, which are formed of delegates elected by the branches, are, as at present constituted, a waste of time and money, as they have no power directly to influence the policy of the society, because immediately they attempt to do so they clash with the functions of the Executive Committee, which can only take instructions from the Annual Assembly of Delegates.  The Executive Committee are at present elected by a ballot vote of the members, the branches of the society being grouped into twelve districts for the purpose, each district electing one member; and the members of the Executive Committee are not responsible to the branches but to the Annual Assembly of Delegates which meets once a year. Mr. Bromley&apos;s proposals are that the number of District Councils, of which there are at present 17, should be reduced to 10, or that the present councils should be merged into 10 groups.  Each group would then elect a member to the Central National Council, which would replace the present Executive Committee as the executive body of the society.  The advantage of this proposed change would be that the new Central National Council would exercise all the functions of the present Executive Council, and, in addition, would have greater direct authority, because it would be more closely in touch with branch opinion and instruction, especially in times of trouble. The branches would govern the society directly by the appointment, to the Central National Council, of a man in touch with them and responsible to them through their District Council.  It is also proposed to give the District Councils power to take entire charge of the welfare of the members in their area, except as regards national conditions of service, which would be regulated by the Annual Assembly of Delegates, and national negotiations, which would be conducted by the Central National Council.  With regard to Mr. Bromley&apos;s scheme, it is of interest ,to notice first, that it has some resemblance to the Soviet organisation, and secondly, that the proposed incorporation of the District Councils in the working consti-tution of the society may be compared with the increasing prominence of the analogous bodies in the National Union of Railwaymen.,National Union of Printing, Bookbinding, Machine Ruling and Paper Workers.  t is reported that the rules which will govern this union an amalgamation of the National Union of Printing and Papers Workers and the National Union of Bookbinders
* See this Eeport, Yol. II, No. 16,16th October, p. 457.and Machine Rulers is now complete, and will come into force when the new union is finally established at the beginning of next year. The union will include the majority of the workers in paper mills and binderies, and most of the semi-skilled workers in the industry, as well as employees of publishers, stationers and other kindred trades. Provision is made in the rules for the subsequent admission to the amalgamation of those societies who at present remain outside, the most important of whom are the National Society of Operative Printers arid Assistants. It may be noted that this amalgamation will bring to a conclusion an inter-union dispute which has considerably weakened sections of the trade during the last few years. About three years ago the National Union of Book-binders and Machine rulers made an attempt to organise the women employed in binderies. This brought them into conflict with the National Union of Printing and Paper Workers and the National Society of Operative Printers and Assistants, both of whom had already enrolled a certain number of the women so employed. The result was the exclusion of the bookbinders, who refused to abandon their position, from the National Printing and Kindred Trades Federation.The new union, which will be the largest in the industry, is to be divided into three sections, namely, printing, paper-making, and bookbinding, the smaller trades being grouped with the most appropriate section. Each of these sections enjoy complete autonomy for five years. At the end of this time individual power will be somewhat limited. The supreme authority will be in the hands of a Delegate Council, elected every two years, which can be summoned at any time. Each section will have its own executive, with a general Executive Council for the whole body. \Amalgamated Society of Woodworkers. Further particulars are now available with regard to the approaching amalgamation of the Amalgamated Society of Carpenters, Cabinet Makers and Joiners and the General Union of Operative Carpenters and Joiners.* The new society, which comes into existence on the 1st January, 1921, will begin work with a membership of over 170,000, of whom 156,000 come from the Amalgamated Society and 15,000 from the General Union. The figure includes a membership of about 26,000 in Australia and New Zealand. It is expected that the new union, which aims at including all woodworkers, except those who belong definitely to an industry not mainly engaged in woodworking, will immediately open up negotiations with other unions of woodworkers. About two years ago the Amalgamated Society of Carpenters, Cabinet Makers and Joiners made an attempt to secure fusion with the National Amalgamated Furnishing Trades Association, and it is probable that the negotiations which then broke down will be resumed when the new society comes into being. Fusion with this association would open the way to the absorption of the smaller societies of upholsterers and other furnishing trades. Other societies likely to be approached include the Amalgamated Society of Woodcutting Machinists and the National Union of Packing Case Makers.Ex-Service Men,Employment of Officers. The Advisory Committee set up under the chairrnanship of Earl Haig to co-ordinate the work of the Officers&apos; Association and the Appointments Department of the Ministry have issued an interim report, which recommends the transfer to the Appointments Department of the appointments work hitherto performed by the Officers&apos; Association, but suggests the continuance by the association of the provision of financial assistance in cases of hardship.International Relations of Labour.International Federation of Trade Unions. Further details are now available of the meeting of the Bureau of the International Federation of Trade Unions at Amsterdam on the 22nd and 23rd October. The Bureau discussed with a special delegation, representing German trade unions, certain questions with regard to the position of Germans within the international trade union movement; and the commission of inquiry, to which reference was made in this Keport last week, was to meet at Essen on the 31st October.The Bureau were also concerned with the arrangements to be made for the congress of the Federation, which is to meet in London on the 22nd November, and will continue in session until the 29th November. The agenda covers the international distribution of raw materials, the stabilisation of rates of exchange, nationalisation and socialisation,
NEGOTIATIONS AND DISPUTES.Demands and Negotiations.Building Trades Operatives (Scotland). A joint meeting of the Scottish National Building Trades Federation (Employers) and the Scottish Building Contractors&apos; Associa-tion was held on the 28th October to consider the wages claim of the Building Trades of Scotland Operatives&apos; Wages and Conditions of Service Board. The claim was fully considered, and there was a consensus of opinion that no further increase should be conceded, but, before agreeing to a conference with representatives of the Wages and Conditions of Service Board, the meeting decided that the president, vice-president, and two other members of the two organisations should meet representatives of the National Federation of Building Trades Employers in London on the 2nd November, with a view to the organisation of con-certed action on wages demands.Textile Printers, Bleachers, Dyers, and Finishers (Yorkshire, Lancashire, Cheshire and Derbyshire). A small joint conference of the parties to this dispute*, held in Manchester on the 25th October with a view to arriving at a settlement, proved fruitless.Commercial Road Transport Workers (Various Areas). Negotiations are proceeding at Manchester, Cardiff, Bristol, Plymouth and Londomf In the last-named area, the National Union of Vehicle Workers and the United Vehicle Workers are negotiating separately -ately.  Both have rejected the employers&apos; offer of payment by results.Shop Assistants (London). The National Amalgamated Union of Shop Assistants, Warehousemen and Clerks received intimation on the 2nd November from the London Employers&apos; Association that, in respect of the staff employed by the Army and Navy Stores, a uniform schedule of rates of pay was in process of preparation and that, on its completion, further communication would take place with the union. On this point Mr. J. Turner, general secretary to the union, states that claims similar to that submitted to the Army and Navy Stores have been sent to other firms in the London Employers&apos; Associa-tion, but these firms have&apos; referred the union to the Retail Distributors&apos; Association, and this organisation has declined to meet the unions&apos;&quot;representatives and have also refused arbitration. $Theatrical Employees (London). The National Association of Theatrical Employees have submitted to the Theatrical Managers&apos; Association a new scale of standard rates of pay and working conditions for every dramatic and variety house in the Metropolitan area.The scale varies from a minimum of  9 a week for a stage manager, master carpenter, chief electrician, chief engineer, or property manager, to the London district building trade labourers&apos; rate for charge hands and other day men. For rehearsals it is proposed that every employee should receive a minimum sum equal to three hours&apos; pay. It is further claimed that all employees, after six months&apos; employment should be given a week&apos;s holiday with pay, and after 12 months, a fortnight.Warehouse Workers (London). A mass meeting of London members of the National Warehouse and General Workers&apos; Union, who are making a claim for an advance of  1 a week on behalf of warehouse workers in London textile houses, passed a resolution on the 2nd November instructing their officials to approach the Ministry of Labour with a view to arbitration.* See this Report, Vol. II, No. 18, 30th October, p. 512.f See this Report, Vol. II, Nor 18, 30th October, p. 508, and also pp. 534 and 535. I See also p. 538 below,and the alleged attacks by existing Governments upon the workers&apos; organisations. Reports on these four topics will be presented by MM. Mertens, Jouhaux, Oudegeest and Fimmen, respectively.The full congress of the Federation will be preceded on the 19th and 20th November by a meeting of the International Executive Committee of the Federation.
Negotiations and Disputes-continued.Strikes and Lock-Outs.Commercial Road Transport Worlcers (Yorkshire). This strike continues at Leeds, Brad-ford, Keighley, Skipton, and Bingley,* and has spread to Huddersfield. On the 28th October a meeting of the West Riding employers declined to discuss with the unions their demand for a minimum of  4 7s. a week, but stated that they were prepared, if the demand were withdrawn, to arrange an immediate conference of all organisations in the West Riding directly concerned in the dispute, to consider any reasonable proposals. On the 2nd November the War Wages Committee of the Bradford Corporation, after receiving deputations from the Bradford Chamber of Trade and from the men&apos;s representatives, passed a resolution urging the Lord Mayor of Bradford to endeavour to effect a settle-ment.The strike, however, appears to be crumbling,^and numbers of men have returned to work.Vehicle Builders (Glasgow). Glasgow vehicle builders, on the 29th October, unani&quot; mously rejected the offer of the Scottish Vehicle Builders&apos; Association of an advance of 2d-per hour on the existing standard rates, and reference of any further demand to arbitration, provided that work was resumed on the 3rd November.fPackers (Manchester). A lock-out of about 500 members of the Manchester Hydraulic Packers&apos; Society, in consequence of their refusal to accept new working conditions, began on the 30th October. The chief points in dispute are the period of notice before the intro-duction of short time, and the question of &quot; migration,&quot; i.e., the transfer of men from one warehouse to another. Joint conferences &apos;are being held under the chairmanship of Mr. E. F. Stockton, of the Manchester Chamber of Commerce, but up to the present, no settlement has been reached.   The dispute was settled on the 3rd November.Settlements and Agreements.Building Trades Operatives (Manchester). It is understood that the dispute con-cerning the payment for &quot; wet tim j &quot; between the Manchester Housing Committee and the building trade operatives engaged on the &quot; direct labour &quot; housing scheme at the Gorton Mount Estate has been settled. Arrangements are being made whereby virtually full-time employment can be provided for the operatives concerned.!Coal Miners (National). On the 28th October, the negotiations between the Govern-ment and the executive of the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain resulted in the drawing up of a provisional agreement which the executive recommended for adoption as a tem-porary measure.  The following are the chief points of the agreement: -(1) Advances of wages by 2s. a shift to persons of 18 years of age and over, Is. to persons of 16 and 17, and H. to persons under 16, from the date of resumption of work, such increases to remain in operation up to and including the 1st January, 1921.(2) Adjustment of wages from the 3rd January and thereafter every four weeks, on the basis of export coal values. The September quarters export values are taken as a standard warranting advances of Is., Qd. and i\d. a shift on present earnings; every increase in the proceeds of export coal by  288,000 a week over the weekly average of the September quarter (after deducting 15s. a ton as the cost of extra output) will entitle the workers to an additional Qd., 3d. or 2\d. a shift; all coal raised in excess of a tonnage at the rate of two hundred and nineteen millions a year will be assumed to be export coal.(3) The Mining Association and the Miners&apos; Federation, by not later than the 31st March, 1921, to prepare a scheme for the regulation of wages in the industry &quot; having regard, among other con-siderations, to the profits of the industry and to the principles upon which any surplus profits are to be dealt with.&quot;(4) The setting up of District Committees and a National Committee to increase output.A special conference of delegates of the Miners&apos; Federation was held at the Memorial Hall, Farringdon Street, on the 3rd November. Mr. Robert Smillie, president of the Federation, took the chair. Mr. Frank Hodges declared the result of the ballot. The number of votes cast was 684,549. For the terms there voted 338,045 ; against, 346,504; majority against, 8,459.The president pointed out the Federation rule relating to any ballot while a strike is in progress, the rule being as follows : &quot; That before a national strike is entered upon as the result of any finding of a conference, a ballot vote of the members shall be taken, and a strike shall not be declared unless two-thirds of those voting vote in favour of such a strike. If a ballot vote be taken during the time a strike is in progress, a vote of two-thirds of those taking part in the ballot shall be necessary to continue the strike.&quot;* See also pp. 533 and 535. f See also p. 536 below.J See this Report, Vol. II, No. 16,16th October, p. 459.
Negotiations and Disputes-continued.A long discussion followed, and a resolution was carried by a substantial majority, that in view of the result of the ballot, and the application of the above rule to the result, the strike be declared off and &quot; the men be advised to resume work to-morrow (Thursday), or as soon thereafter as possible.&quot;Commercial Road Transport Workers (Various Areas). As a result of local negotiations, settlements have been effected at Carlisle, Liverpool and Swansea. At Carlisle the men resumed work on the 29th October, the employers granting 7s. Qd. a week advance. At Swansea, the men received an advance of 10s. per week, making the weekly minimum  4. At Liverpool the employers&apos; offer of a weekly increase of 4s. to motor drivers, 3s. to teams-men, 2s. to single-horse drivers, and Is. to juniors was accepted, the employers undertaking that no change should be made in haulage rates charged to merchants and traders in con-sequence of this agreement.Operative Bakers (South Wales and Monmouthshire). It will be remembered that the South Wales branches of the Amalgamated Union of Operative Bakers, Confectioners and Allied Workers were instructed to negotiate locally with the respective masters&apos; associa-tions.* In some instances the coal strike has caused delay, but in others agreements have already been reached. In the great majority of cases these are based upon an advance of 10s. per week, but certain co-operative societies are conceding an advance of 2s. per day.Grocers&apos; Assistants (Glasgow). An agreement has been arrived at between the National Amalgamated Union of Shop Assistants, Warehousemen and Clerks, and the Glasgow Grocers and Provision Merchants&apos; Association, applicable to Glasgow, Lanarkshire and the Clyde Valley. The agreement prescribes a minimum rate of 72s. Qd. for male assistants at the age of 26, and of 45s. for female assistants at the age of 24. It further prescribes that all employees shall receive 12 consecutive working days&apos; holiday, in addition to all statutory and customary holidays, after 12 months&apos; service, and that those with less than 12 months&apos; service shall receive one day&apos;s holiday for every month of service. The agree-ment is to continue binding upon both parties until three months after either party give notice of their intention to terminate or revise it. This agreement has been recom-mended to the Scottish Employers&apos; Federation for general adoption throughout the country. The union have approached the Edinburgh and Leith Grocers&apos; Association on the question of wages and conditions of labour.[Other disputes, negotiations and settlements are referred to in the Industrial Relations Departments section of the Report, pages 536 to 540.](b 16594)
PART II-THE WORK OF THE MINISTRY.INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS DEPARTMENT.ARBITRATION AND CONCILIATION.AWARDS.The number of awards issued during the week was seven, all under the Industrial Courts Act.Papermakers (Great Britain). The Court gave interpretations of various clauses of their Award No. 473 and fixed rates for juniors doing the work of adults. (Awards Nos. 503 and 504.)&apos; Carpenters (Ireland). The Court decided that the rate for carpenters employed in railway shops outside a radius of twenty miles from Dublin should be l\d. per hour less than the rate eventually established for carpenters employed in railway shops in the Dublin area.   (Award No. 509.)AGREEMENTS AND  SETTLEMENTS.Vehicle Building (National).-At a conference at Montagu House on the 27th October, under the chairmanship of Mr. McKerrell, it was agreed that there shall be an advance of 2d. per hour for adult workmen, Id. per hour for youths between 19 and 21 years of age, and 2s. 6d. per week advance for. youths and apprentices under 19 years of age.Systems of payment by results may be introduced, or, where piece-work or other systems are in operation, they may continue. Where any of the employees on any particular class of work in any individual shop agree, the employers shall not be debarred from arranging a system of payment by results with these employees, provided that the details are mutually agreed, and that in all cases the time-rate is guaranteed irrespective of piece-work earnings. Provision is made for mutual fixing and acceptance of all piece-prices and for overtime allowances in addition to piece-prices. No piece-masters shall be allowed. All wages or balances are to be paid through the office to each man, and no debit balance is to be carried forward beyond the weekly or monthly period of settlement. This agreement will be valid up to the end of March, 1921, and two months&apos; notice of any proposed variation is to be given on either side.There is to be no victimisation on either side. Where it is impossible for an employer to find employment immediately for all his workpeople, no new man shall be engaged until all the old employees have had an opportunity of returning to their former employ-ment. Work is to be resumed forthwith. The representatives of the workpeople shall cordially co-operate with the employers to promote the highest possible efficiency among their men, in order to secure, in the best interests of the trade, such increased output as will recompense employers for the advance.The parties to the agreement are the National Federation of Vehicle Trades, on the one hand, and, on the other, the National Union of Vehicle Builders, the Amalgamated Wheelwrights, Smiths and Kindred Trades Union and the Amalgamated Society of Woodcutting Machinists.Taxi-cab Drivers (London)-A dispute between the London drivers and the owners resulted in about 800 of the men striking early in September^ Under the auspices of the department, a meeting of the United Vehicle Workers and the Joint Committee of the London Motor Cab Trade was held on the 27th October. A provisional settlement was arranged, by which the owners agreed to bear all petrol mileage and other running charges. The drivers are to receive 22-g- per cent, commission, in place of 25 per cent., to be increased to 25 per cent, if and when the present fares are increased. This agreement is subject to confirmation by the constituent members of both sides.* See this Report, Vol. II, No, 12,18th September, p. 363.
* See this Report, Vol. II, No. 15, 9th October, p. 452. (b 16594) 3 Z 2Mow Millers (Ireland). Sir J. R. 0&apos;Connell was appointed as conciliator, under the Conciliation Act, in a dispute between the Irish Transport and General Workers&apos; Union and the Irish Associations of Flour Milling Employers. Advances were agreed to of 105. per week for men in mills in Dublin, Belfast, Cork and Limerick, and of 6s. and 5s. per week in country mills having roller surfaces over and under 500 inches, respectively; women and boys to receive half these advances. Holidays with pay and other working conditions were fixed.Garters (Rosyth).-Members of the Scottish Horse and Motormen&apos;s Association employed by an Admiralty carting contractor at Rosyth Dockyard threatened to strike during September to enforce an advance in their wages. The contractor contended that his contract price would not permit him to pay more, and stated that, although he had made repeated representations to the local Admiralty authorities, he had received no satisfaction. The case was reported to the Admiralty by the department, and, as a result of an inquiry, the contract price was raised from 17s. to 25s. per horse and man per day.Lair age Workers (Manchester). The slaughtermen&apos;s dispute in Manchester* is now settled, the men having applied for reinstatement on the old conditions. A number were taken on again on the 18th October, but the employers could not reinstate all of them, as they refused to discharge fresh men taken on during the strike. The total number reinstated is about 50, exclusive of the casual men working for non-federated firms.Waste Payer Workers (London). A strike occurred at the works of Messrs. Lendrum, Ltd., on the 25th October, arising out of a notice that all employees should consider that they were daily servants. A form of application for employment was also issued, stating, as a condition of employment, that the applicant should be a daily servant, although wages might be paid weekly. A conference was held at the firm&apos;s offices at which the unions concerned and the Chief Conciliation Officer, London, were represented. It was ascer-tained that the firm&apos;s chief argument was the extra cost involved in giving a week&apos;s notice. After much discussion it was agreed that all employees, for the first month of service, should be subject to a day&apos;s notice, but a week&apos;s notice should be given afterwards. The agreement is not to become operative until one week after the settlement of the coal strike.COMMITTEES, CONFERENCES AND DEPUTATIONS.Demarcation Dispute: Plumbers and Heating and Domestic Engineers. Demarcation questions between the plumbers and the heating and domestic engineers are of very long standing. Trouble has broken out afresh on important housing schemes for the Manchester Corporation. A hot water supply is to be provided from a central station, with distributing mains laid under the streets, and branch pipes from&quot;the mains to the houses. The heating and domestic engineers are fitting up the supply stations and the mains, leaving to the plumbers all work in connection with the branch pipes. The plumbers, however, claim that all work in connection with the distributing mains belongs exclusively to them.The Chief Labour Adviser received a deputation from the Heating and Domestic Engineers&apos; Joint Industrial Council on the 26th October. They explained that the plumbers&apos; action was at variance with an award of national application given by the Federation of the Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades last June. They stated that the plumbers contended that they had never consented to refer the question to the Federation, and declined to recognise the award. Matters had reached a deadlock, and they desired to know whether the department would be&apos; prepared to set up a Court of Inquiry.It was explained that only in one case had a Court of Inquiry been set up without the consent of both parties, and that the policy of the department was to establish such Courts only with the full concurrence of. both sides. The deputation were informed, however, that the department would get into touch with the plumbers&apos; union.Members of the executive council of the United Operative Plumbers and Domestic Engineers&apos; Association were accordingly interviewed on the 28th October, and, after their views had been ascertained, Sir David Shackieton informed them that he proposed to summon a conference of the parties, to be held at Manchester on the 4th November, to see whether some provisional settlement could be made with regard to the Manchester dispute, and to arrange, if possible, to settle the demarcation issue on national grounds. The conference will be held under the chairmanship of an officer of the department.
QUESTIONS PENDING AND MISCELLANEOUS.Ship Repair Trade [Mersey District). Despite prolonged efforts by a representative of the department, it was found impossible to get a joint conference of the employers and workpeople while the men remain on strike.Shop Assistants (London). The National Amalgamated Union of Shop Assistants, Warehousemen and Clerks have communicated the resolution passed at the Albert Hall meeting on the 22nd October* to the Incorporated Association of Retail Distributors and the London Employers&apos; Association, who are now considering it. From informal conversations between the Principal Assistant Secretary and representatives of both sides, it appears that both parties are inclined to continue the discussion, and that the intervention of the department is not needed at present.Request for Re-Hearing Refused. In July the Admiralty were informed that the Ministry were not prepared to re-open a casef which had been the subject of a recent Industrial Court award. The Admiralty have inquired whether the Minister would now see any objection to assenting to an application for a further reference of the claim to arbitration. The Minister has replied that he is not in a position to discuss the merits of the claim which was referred-to the Industrial Court and settled by their Awards, and that he adheres to his previous decision that the case should not be re-opened.INDUSTRIAL COUNCILS. JOINT STANDING INDUSTRIAL COUNCILS.Reports.Boot and Shoe Manufacture.-The committee appointed to draft a special scheme of unemployment insurance met on the 21st October. A draft scheme, prepared by the National Union of Boot and Shoe Operatives, was considered in detail and agreed to. After the opinion of an actuary has been obtained, the scheme will be submitted to the department.Building. The Education Committee met on the 28th October to consider steps to put into operation the findings of the committee on technical and general education and on boy apprenticeship. It was decided to request the Training Department to put their organisation at the disposal of the committee, with a view to stimulating local interest and to facilitating the setting up of local Building Trades.Apprenticeship Committees. At a subsequent conference with headquarters and local officers of the Training Department, it was stated that the Ministry were willing to comply with the request.Gas. The Council met on the 27th October. It was reported that the Executive Committee had agreed upon the model constitution for works committees in the industry. The Council received reports from the District Councils in regard to the progress made in zoneing and grading, and the Executive Committee were instructed to obtain information upon existing schemes of education and training for persons employed in the industry.Hosiery. The second annual meeting of the Council was held on the 20th October. Mr. N. Naylor, a workers&apos; representative, was elected chairman and Mr. H. F. Lancashire vice-chairman. The CounciTs draft scheme for contracting out of the Unemployment Insurance Act, and the report of the recent conference with officers of the Employment Department, were discussed. The Council decided to make strong representations to the Government on the necessity of marking imported goods to indicate the place of origin, and of making provision to safeguard the industry against dumping and the importation of goods manufactured by cheap labour.Local Authorities&apos; Non-Trading Services, Manual Workers (England and Wales). The District Council for the Northern Home Counties met on the 25th October and fixed rates of wages for full-time and part-time women employees of local authorities within the area.Match Manufacture. The Council met on the 27th October.  The business was almost entirely formal.Printing. Owing to the coal strike no further developments have occurred in the wages negotiations in the printing industry. Although the master printers had made it clear that they are not willing to improve upon their offer of 5s. and 2s.,, the Printing and Kindred Trades Federation asked for a further joint conference on the 3rd November. The masters agreed to meet them.* See this Report, Vol. II, No. 18, 30th October, p. 508. f See this Report, Vol. II, No. 4, 24th July, p. 164.
Process Engraving.-Th.e Council met on the 26th October. It was stated that it had not been possible as yet to form any District Councils. The main discussion centred round a report of the Unemployment Committee. It was agreed that a special contracting-out scheme would be difficult to arrange, and it was generally agreed that the possibility of forming a voluntary supplementary scheme, raising the benefit to 52s. per week, should be explored, the masters contributing to the cost of this scheme equally with the employees. It is suggested that attendance at a technical school should be required of all persons receiving unemployment benefit, if the schools are available. It is probable that the Council will consider a juvenile scheme at their next meeting. The vice-chairman has arranged to discuss such a scheme with the department shortly.Tin Mining. The Council met on the 22nd October and settled several minor differences arising out of the last wages agreement.Tramways. The Council met on the 27th October to consider an application, sub-mitted on behalf of the trade union side, for an immediate advance to all tramway employees, aged 18 years and over, of 12s. per week upon the wages at present paid, and of 6s. per week to all youths under 18 years of age. The companies&apos; representatives present declined to take part in any negotiations which might result in increased wages haying to be paid to tramway employees. They then withdrew from the meeting. The municipal and trade union representatives appointed their respective secretaries as a committee to collect data as to the increased * cost of living compared with the increased wages or bonuses paid to the various classes of tramway employees ; to draw up a comparison between the wages paid to the various classes of tramway employees and other classes in comparable occupations and to draw up a report on the present financial position of the various municipal tramway undertakings, with a view to ascer-taining the increased costs of operation, and the result of the increased charging powers that have been put into force. The municipal representatives stated that their offer of further consideration did not in any way commit them to recommending the acceptance of any portion of the application, whilst the trade union representatives stated that they were not prepared to make wages dependent on the financial conditions of the respective under-takings, but adhered to the principle that they were entitled to advances comparable with the admitted increases in the cost of living. It was decided that the Council should meet on the 12th November to consider the application further.Wool (and Allied) Textiles. The West of England District Council met on the 28th October. The workers asked for a revision of the wages settlement arrived at by arbitra-tion in April, 1920, but, following on the statement of the chairman, in which he outlined the serious depression in the industry at the present time, they withdrew their demand.Local Authorities&apos; Administrative, Technical and Clerical Services (England and Wales). -A conference of representatives of local authorities in the West Midland area, and of the staff associations, on the 26th October, agreed that a District Council for the area be formed, and a committee was appointed to draft the constitution.Civil Service. The National Council for the Administrative and Legal Departments of the Civil Service met on the 26th October. Sir Malcolm Ramsay, K.C.B., presided. The Council received two reports from the Cost of Living Committee. One report recorded an agreement in regard to the revision of the rates of overtime pay of permanent and quasi-permanent classes whose overtime pay is calculated at a fixed rate, or is subject to an over-riding maximum. This report was formally adopted by the Council. The other report recorded a disagreement in regard to the remuneration of temporary officers and employees not covered by Awards Nos. 84 and 101 of the Civil Service Arbitration Board. It was announced that this matter was being referred to the Arbitration Board and that the hearing had been fixed for the 1st November. The Council adopted the Interim Report from the Committee on the Further Education of Civil Servants, dealing with the position of civil servants between the ages of 14 and 16, with special reference to the provisions of the Education Act, 1918.The Council adopted the following resolutions regarding the communication of adverse reports: (1) Except in cases which may give rise to criminal proceedings, full particulars of any charge against an officer&apos;s Conduct shall be communicated to him in writing, before any disciplinary action is decided upon. (2) The procedure to be adopted in the case of reports affecting promotion is a matter for the consideration of the promoting-tions Committee. (3) When a report upon an officer in circumstances not covered by (1) or (2) reflects adversely upon his character or efficiency, he shall be informed of the
INTERIM INDUSTRIAL RECONSTRUCTION COMMITTEES.Reports.Gas Mantle. The sub-committee appointed by the Interim Committee met on the 25th October. The model Joint Industrial Council constitution was discussed, clause by clause, and accepted, with slight modifications. The recommendations will be submitted to the Committee on the 22nd November.[Reference to matters of interest in connection with Industrial Relations will be found also on pages 528 to 535, and 548 to 550.]defects attributed to him, in order to enable him to offer any explanation, before the report is placed on record. (It was decided to set up a special committee to consider the general conditions of superannuation in the administrative and legal departments of the Civil Service, and a special committee to consider the conditions of service of professional, technical and scientific civil servants. The Council decided to postpone the consideration of a proposal to appoint a special committee to consider the rates of travelling and subsistence allow-ances, pending the submission of a memorandum setting out the results of an investigation being made by the staff side. The practice of requiring a stamped receipt for salaries was raised, and the official side stated that they were making inquiries in regard to the matter. It was arranged that the question of exempting unestablished civil servants who had served in the Forces from medical examination on establishment should be discussed by three members of each side of the Council.A number of other matters were discussed, notably the question of acting appoint-ments, and certain aspects of the report of the Lytton Committee on the employment of ex-Service men in the Civil Service.Miscellaneous.Proposed Association of Joint Industrial Councils and Interim Industrial Reconstruction Committees.-Th.e Provisional Committee met on the 21st October and agreed to make the following proposals to all Joint Industrial Councils and Interim Industrial Eecon-struction Committees: (1) That an association be formed whose functions shall be to discuss matters of common interest and to make a joint representation to the Government. (2) That the Association be formed of all Joint Industrial Councils and Interim Industrial Reconstruction Committees, to each of which shall be allotted two representatives. (3) That the Ministry be asked to provide a secretariat and accommodation for con-ferences. (4) That the officers be a chairman and vice-chairman, who should preside alternately, and that the Ministry be respectfully requested to attend meetings of the Council. (5) That the Convening Committee consist of the chairman, vice-chairman and two members from each side of the Council, with the secretary.These proposals of the Provisional Committee will be submitted to the full conference on the 8th December, when it is hoped that Mr. J. H. Whitley, M.P., will be able to address the conference. It will be noticed that the proposals are now confined to the establish-ment of a body which will hold regular conferences on matters of joint interest.Lotk, Latch and Key. The Midland Lock and Latch Trade Wages Board met on the 26th October, when the question of transforming the Wages Board into a Joint Industrial Council was considered. The trade union concerned has already expressed itself in favour oi this course, and the employers&apos; representatives decided to refer the matter to a special general meeting of their association which will be called in the near future.
GENERAL DEPARTMENT.TRADE BOARDS.PROCEEDINGS.Hollow-ware Trade Board (Great Britain). The Piece-work Committee decided to defer consideration of the possibility of making further provision for the&apos;protection of piece-workers.General Waste Materials Reclamation Trade Board (Great Britain). The Woollen Rags Sub-Committee considered minimum rates for workers in the woollen rag section of the trade, but reached no agreement. It was resolved to report the views of each side of the committee to the Board.Pin, Hook and Eye and Snap Fastener Trade Board (Great Britain). The Board agreed to fix general minimum time-rates and overtime rates for male and female workers, other than homeworkers, and female piece-workers employed in carding hooks and eyes or snap fasteners, and also to fix piece-work basis time-rates for certain classes of female workers. A sub-committee was appointed to consider the question of fixing minimum rates for female workers, less than 18 years of age, employed on carding. A report from the Special Rates Committee was considered, and it was resolved to give Notice.of Proposal to vary general minimum time-rates in respect of female workers, 18 years of age and over, employed as charge hands, and of certain classes of male workers, 21 years of age and over. Consequent upon the report of the Homeworkers Sub-Committee, the Board agreed to issue a Notice of Proposal to fix a piece-work basis time-rate of l\d. per hour for al lhomeworkers.The Board appointed an Administrative Committee, and delegated to this committee the issue of permits of exemption, and also the question of co-operation between Juvenile Advisory Committees and the Board.4 letter was considered from the Stamped or Pressed Metal Wares Traae Board (Great Britain), relating to the desirability of the consolidation of the Boards for various metal trades. It was agreed that representatives be appointed to attend a joint meeting with representatives from the Button-Making Trade Eoard, the Coffin Furniture and Cerement-Making Trade Board, and the Stamped or Pressed Metal Wares Trade Board, to discuss this question, and to report to the Board.Toy Trade Board (Great Britain). The Board agreed to propose general minimum time-rates for male workers. It was further agreed that the Special Rates Committee, constituted at the previous meeting, should consider and report to the Board what rates, if any, should be fixed for any special class of male workers.Grocery and Provisions Trade Board (England and Wales).-The Board agreed to issue a Notice of Proposal to fix minimum rates for female workers employed as shop assistants and porters, as defined by the Board, and considered the question of minimum rates for male and female clerical workers. A sub-committee was appointed to consider what minimum rates shall be proposed for commercial travellers, and to report to each side and to the Board.Retail Bespoke Tailoring Trade Board (Great Britain). The Administrative Committee deferred consideration of the minimum rates to be proposed for female apprentices and learners excluded from the operation of the rates fixed for female workers, and the question of a possible adjustment in the rates fixed for female learners, pending receipt of the Special Sub-Committee&apos;s report in connection with these matters, and also of the proposed scheme of apprenticeship.The Board resolved to refer to the Administrative Committee, for consideration, the question of varying the minimum rates at present fixed for male and female workers, in their application to country districts.Notice was given on behalf of the representatives of employers that it would be moved at the next meeting that cutters and trimmers should be excluded from the operation of the rates fixed by the Board.In reply to an inquiry from the Ministry as to the desirability of including within the scope of the Dressmaking and Women&apos;s Light Clothing Trade Board, certain alteration hands and others, now within the scope of the Retail Bespoke Tailoring Trade Board, the Board resolved to inform the department that, in their opinion, no case had been made out for any alteration in the present definition of the scope of the Board.The Board considered a resolution passed at a conference of Local Technical Advisory Committees for retail bespoke tailoring, urging the Government to provide a permanent field of employment for disabled ex-Service men.  They agreed to endorse the resolution
in so far as it applies to the retail bespoke tailoring trade, and to urge the responsible authority to give effect to it. It was also agreed to ask the Ready-Made and Wholesale Bespoke Tailoring Trade Board (Great Britain) to co-operate in this matter.The Board considered a report from, the Ministry on the enforcement of Trade Board minimum rates in the tailoring trade, and agreed to ask for fuller information with regard to inspection.-The Board considered certain questions of scope referred to them -by the Ministry, and agreed to communicate the opinions expressed to the department.It was agreed that the Log Committee should be asked to meet again, with a view to coming to an agreement as to the application of log rates to the piece-work basis time-rates fixed by the Board.The Board agreed to recommend to the Ministry of Health that, for insurance purposes, the special units of work for outworkers should be 50s. for male workers, and 30s. for female workers.Hair, Bass and Fibre Trade Board (Great Britairi).-Th.e Administrative Committee received a draft scheme, prepared by the chairman, providing for co-operation between the Board and Juvenile Advisory Committees.The Board fixed and varied certain minimum rates of wages for male and female workers on the basis of their Notice of Proposal dated the 26th August, 1920.* Con-sideration of a motion that all minimum rates fixed by the Board be increased by 15 per cent, was deferred.It was agreed that a letter be sent to the Ministry requesting reconsideration of the question of the application of the Trade Boards Acts to the hair, bass and fibre trade in Ireland.FIXING AND VARIATION OF MINIMUM RATES OF WAGES.Rope, Twine and Net Trade Board (Ireland). The Board have issued a Notice of Proposal dated the 27th October, to fix general minimum time-rates for certain classes of female workers. The general minimum time-rates proposed for female workers of all ages employed &quot;within the area of the county of Belfast range from 8-\d. to 8f$. per hour, and for those outside that area from 7fd. to 8^. per hour, with lower rates for cleaners, layers, dafiers and learners.Jute Trade Board (Great Britain).

The Minister has made Special Orders applying the Trade Boards Acts to the boot and floor polish trade and the whip trade.[References to matters of interest in connection with Trade Boards will also be found on pagejS50.]General Department continued.
EMPLOYMENT AND INSURANCE DEPARTMENT.EMPLOYMENT EXCHANGES.The Unemployment Position.Owing to the strike in the coal mining industry the usual figures of registrations, placings and vacancies are not available.For statistical information as to the effect of the strike on claims to out-of-work donation and unemployment insurance benefit, see page 528 above.Metis Employment.General. The labour situation during the week has been overshadowed by the dispute in the coal industry. A comparison of the claims of out-of-work donation and unemploy-ment insurance benefit for the weeks ending the 15th and the 22nd October show very appreciable increases, but, on the whole, the figures in most divisions are by no means so alarming as was expected. The position, however, is sufficiently grave as an intimation of what would happen if the dispute were prolonged. There are indications that, in a number of districts, the Order restricting the consumption of fuel has precipitated unemployment owing to the diminished supply of power and light.It is obvious, however, that, apart from effects clearly attributable to the strike, un-employment has increased in the engineering, textile and other industries, in which depression has been more or less marked for many weeks. This is shown by the increases reported in the live registers of Exchanges in areas not appreciably affected by the strike.Local Reports. In the North-Western Division, with the exception of Crewe, Horwich, Royton and Shaw, every Exchange reports a considerable increase of unemployment. At Bootle the strike of shipwrights is still the main cause, and there is no immediate prospect of a settlement. There has, however, been a slight improvement in employment at the docks. Unemployment at Liverpool has been considerably increased by the strike. It is reported, however, that employers are showing a tendency to re-engage workpeople suspended owing to the strike. At Birkenhead and Wallasey the position is still dominated by the shipbuilding dispute; but 350 men registered at the Exchange have obtained employment with Messrs. Clover, Clayton &amp; Co., Ltd., who have received three ships for repair. At Blackburn and Great Harwood there is considerable unemployment owing to the general depression in the textile trade ; 43 cotton mills are closed entirely, and a number of others partially. In the engineering industry a short-time working arrange-ment has been adopted, which allows each man three short days employment per week. There is considerable distress in Great Harwood, where 25 per cent, of the looms are idle from causes not connected with the coal dispute.  A local Distress Fund has been started.At Salford complete unemployment increases comparatively slowly, as there is a tendency to resort to short-time,arrangements rather than to general discharges. At Chorley the increase is barely appreciable. At Darwen there has been a change for the worse; 10 cotton mills have closed down indefinitely, and the remaining 25 are working short time. The main cause is the general depression in the textile trade, and the enforced reduction in fuel consumption.In the Yorkshire and East Midlands Division the increase of claims to donation and benefit is not entirely attributable to the strike. A general depression affects textile, lace and clothing firms, and the strike of transport workers in Leeds and Bradford is responsible for much unemployment in those towns. Stocks of coal held by employers are greater than as at first believed, and, with the exception of the iron and steel works, which closed immediately, general discharges have not been large. Short-time schemes have been freely introduced. The transport strike, with its attendant picketing, has greatly diminished deliveries: storage accommodation is congested, and there is a prospect of a stoppage of production and cancellation of orders.The depression in the clothing trade increases from week- to week. The position in the textile trades is somewhat similar, although there is as yet no. shortage of coal such as would cause the mills to close down completely. The lace trade is working on short time, and much unemployment continues.In Wales the conduct of the miners and other unemployed workpeople affected by the coal dispute has been exemplary.  The early incidents at Tonypandy have proved quite(b 16594) 4 A
exceptional. Employers have striven to continue employment until their stocks of coal have been exhausted. Some tinplate mills have stopped partially, but tlieir products are being finished in other departments as long as coal supplies hold out. The representa-tive of the Coal Control has agreed to give special consideration to cases brought to his notice by the department, where additional coal would prevent unemployment. The co-operation of several Exchange managers in this matter has had useful results.The ship-repairing industry at Swansea and Newport has been active during the past fortnight, and boilermakers from Cardiff have been transferred to meet the shortage of labour at Newport.  At Barry and Cardiff, however, the trade is depressed.In the London and South-Eastern Division the strike has not been very appreciably felt, except in Canning Town, Deptford and Poplar, where its effects have been rather severe, chiefly among coal porters employed in Joading ships for foreign ports. The general trade depression, however, tends in many districts to become more acute, At Bermondsey, many firms are working short time, including Messrs. Peak Frean &amp; Co., Ltd., who employ upwards of 4,000 workpeople. Unemployment is reported to be on the increase in the Borough, Leyton, Shoreditch and Stepney and is still acute at Camberwell, Poplar and Woolwich. At Camberwell there have been demonstrations of unemployed, and deputa-tions to the local authorities. The Borough Council have started work at certain of their depots, for which 72 men are being supplied by the Exchange;, to work four days a week. Work on a scheme for further road repair work has been started, but is held up owing to lack of materials. At Woolwich, the decision of the authorities to discharge Royal Arsenal employees at the age of 60 instead of 65 will affect 800 men in the course of the next few weeks. They have no prospect of re-employment in the locality. The matter, however, has been taken up by a Town&apos;s Committee.In the South-Western Division the unemployment rate at Bristol is still high and continues to give occasion for much anxiety. Unemployment at Cowes is abnormal, owing to the closing down of the Skoota Mota factory, and continued discharges by Messrs. S. E. Saunders, Ltd. At Redruth, owing to the position at the Dolcoath and Tincroft mines, it is expected that fully 500 men will be unemployed at the end of the week. Un-employment in Southampton, which is only slightly above normal, is attributed to slackness in the shipbuilding yards and to the coal strike. A considerable amount of repair work has been transferred to Belgium and Germany, and employers are unable to accept contracts for new work owing to the uncertain labour situation.There has been no marked increase in unemployment in the West Midlands Division, as many employers have placed their workpeople on short time. It is thought that, with an early settlement of the strike, abnormal unemployment would rapidly diminish. Employers show a ready disposition to assist the department by carrying out their arrange-ments. The Coventry City Council have resolved to commence work immediately on the roads and the memorial park. *In the Northern Division, most firms at Newcastle-on-Tyne hope to carry on without much change of staff for about a month. The employees of Sir W. G. Armstrong, Whitworth &amp; Co., Ltd., Elswick, have been kept at work on day-to-day notices. Darlington report no extensive discharges during the week. Messrs. Palmer&apos;s Shipbuilding &amp; Iron Co., Ltd., Jarrow, have been engaged during the week in repairs to their blastfurnaces, steel works and rolling mills. Wherever possible, they have re-engaged discharged workers to carry out these repairs. The situation at Middlesbrough has steadied considerably, although the majority of the blastfurnaces have been damped down. Firms have been employing as many men as possible on reconstruction, maintenance and repair work. At South Shields, casual workers have been discharged by various firms, and the River Wear Com-missioners have suspended about 200 men at Sunderland.In Scotland the ironfounding industry continues to be that most adversely affected by the strike. Motherwell, with 6,000 steel workers unemployed, Rutherglen, with 2,000, Springburn, with 2,500, and Parkhead, with about 5,000, are the districts chiefly affected. The steadiness of employment in the shipbuilding and the engineering industries has been one of the most satisfactory features of the week. In the woollen and hosiery industries, which expected large discharges, work is proceeding on practically normal lines, and a serious dislocation is not now expected. The jute industry at Dundee is working short time, three days employment a week being all that is available for some 50,000 workpeople.In Ireland, except among dock and ship workers, numbers of whom have been thrown out of work owing to the curtailment of the cross-channel shipping service, unemployment has not been appreciably increased owing to the strike. Most large industrial concerns have had sufficient stocks of coal to keep their staffs employed. The situation at Belfast, as regards unemployment due to the civil commotion, remains unchanged.  Employ-
ment in shipbuilding at Cork is still on the decline. Since the building strike began at Dublin on the 4th October, 200 skilled building operatives have been sent to cross-channel vacancies. A number of textile workers in Lisburn and Londonderry are on short time, and there is continued depression in all branches of trade at Galway, Kilkenny, Sligo and Limerick.  Railway dislocation continues in Limerick and Waterford.Woman&apos;s Employment.General. As reported for many weeks past the unemployment and under-employment of women has been gradually increasing in the great majority of staple industries. Among the many factors contributing to this situation the uncertainty created by the possibility of a coal stoppage has played an important part. While it is certain that the effects of the strike will be serious and cumulative, the reports from the divisions for the week ending the 23rd October indicate that, in regard to women, they have not been as sudden or as serious as might have been expected. The iron, steel and engineering industries, which have hitherto been most adversely affected, are mainly men&apos;s industries. In the industries in which women are employed in large numbers, as, for example, the textile industries of the North-Western, Yorkshire and East Midlands and Scotland Divisions, great efforts have been made by the employers to work short time, in order to avoid wholesale dis-charges, and this has minimised distress. The case is the same in other industries. The South-Western Division states that at Portsmouth all the corset-making firms have gone on short time, and that at Taunton the lace factories are working alternate weeks.The London and South-Eastern Division state that, while firms continue to close down, the strike has aggravated but not created the industrial depression. The South Midlands and Eastern Division also state that, though the general trade depression has been accentuated by the strike, no considerable developments of abnormal unemployment have yet taken place. In the West Midlands Division, also, no very sudden increases have yet occurred. At Kidderminster, carpet manufacturing firms employing 2,000 workers, mainly women, are on short time. Nearly all the pottery firms in the Burslem area are said to be closing down, and many in the Longton area are on the verge of complete stoppage through lack of fuel. It will be remembered that hitherto there was marked activity in these two industries, compared with the depression in other staple trades. In Wales every effort is being made to continue employment in the tinplate and other industries.LOCAL EMPLOYMENT COMMITTEES.Activities of Committees.Employment and Resettlement. The Wolverhampton Committee considered the emergency arrangements for dealing with unemployment arising out of the coal strike, and appointed two sub-committees, one to assist in the payment of out-of-work donation and the other to assist in finding labour for essential services. They also decided to draw the Mayor&apos;s attention to the rapidly increasing numbers of unemployed, and to assure him of their co-operation in any scheme for providing work instituted by the municipal authorities.The Boston Committee refused to set up sub-committees, and the Macclesfield Com-mittee deferred setting up a sub-committee until the term &quot; essential services &quot; should he more clearly defined. ,At a conference of the Enfield Committee, employers of labour and local authorities, called to discuss the abnormal conditions of local employment, the members pledged them-selves to do all they possibly could to restrict discharges, and to use every influence to pro-vide employment during; the coming winter. It was decided to forward a copy of the resolution to every employer in the Exchange area.The Bridgwater Committee report that a deputation waited on the Chamber of Commerce with a view to the immediate relief of unemployment. The Chamber of Com-merce undertook to do their best to urge forward housing improvements, and any other schemes for the good of the town and the relief of unemployment.Out-of-Work Donation and Unemployment Insurance-The Eccles Committee deem it advisable for the Minister to announce that it is his desire that all members of trade unions shall, where possible, make arrangements to obtain their unemployment insurance benefit through their respective unions.Ex-Service Men. The Acton Committee are of the opinion that the time has arrived when the Government should take up the question of the employment of ex-Service men(b 16594) &apos;     4 A 2
APPOINTMENTS AND TRAINING.APPOINTMENTS AND CIVIL LIABILITIES DEPARTMENT.APPOINTMENTS.Statistics. During the week ending the 22nd October, the Appointments Department placed 449 candidates for appointments, bringing the total number of candidates known to have been placed to 43,317. Of these, 5,874 were placed through the agency of the department^ Interviewing Boards. Applications were registered from 689 ex-Service men and 35 civilians. The total number of candidates available for appointments on the 22nd October was 11,694 ex-Service men and 1,621 civilians. At the same date 1,247 &quot;live&quot; vacancies were at the disposal of the department, 556 having been registered during the wreek.BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONAL TRAINING.Maintenance and Training Grants Scheme.-D\mng the week ending the 22nd October, the Appointments Department received applications for training under this scheme from 113 officers and men of equal educational qualifications, of which 58 were for training of the type provided by the department. Deducting cancellations and withdrawals, 28,236 applications for training of this latter type have been received in all, and 50,325 for training of the type provided by other Government departments. The Interviewing Boards have dealt to date with 27,225 applications, of which 22,853 have been recom-mended. The Grants Committee, dealing with applications so recommended, have received 21,728 applications, and sanctioned grants in 17,911 cases.Training of Disabled Officers under Pensions Warrant. The Appointments Department have dealt with a total of 890 cases, in 424 of which the training sanctioned is providedapart from the National Scheme, as they are of opinion that the solution of the question is one for the Government and not for employers.OUT-OF-WORK  DONATION  AND  UNEMPLOYMENT  INSURANCE  BENEFIT.Out-of-Work Donation. Returns by the Finance Department, according to information received at the Claims and Record Office, Kew, for the week ending the 21st October, show 125,304 payments to policy holders, involving an amount of  129,884 Is. lid.Unemployment Insurance Benefit. The number of payments of unemployment insur-ance benefit made during the week ending the 15th October was 56,803, involving an amount of  29,473 8s. 5d.DISCHARGED AND DISABLED SAILORS AND SOLDIERS.National Scheme.Up to and including the 27th October, 21,922 certificates have been issued to employers under the Scheme. The undertakings given by these employers cover 233,998 disabled ex-Service men.The Divisional Controller of the London and South-Eastern Division reports that the Bankers&apos; Association of Great Britain and Ireland have agreed to adopt the provisions of the National Scheme with a slight modification.The Sutton Exchange report the placing of a disabled man, aged 52, with a firm of scientific instrument makers. The man had served 15 years in the Army, and 20 years as a postman, and had received 11 months&apos; training.The Catherine Street Exchange have placed two men who have lost their left arms, as cigarette makers, at a weekly wage of  3, plus a cigarette ration.The Grays Exchange report that the disabled register has been cleared during the month, and that it is expected that, in future, each disabled man will be placed as he registers for employment.[Reference to matters of interest to the Employment Department will also be found on pages 528 to 530, 538, 539, 542, 548 and 550.]
by the Appointments Department and in the remainder by other Government departments. Candidates accepted by the Ministry of Labour have completed their training in 217 cases, and abandoned training in 39 ; 140 are still in training, and 28 are awaiting training.TRAINING DEPARTMENT.INDUSTRIAL TRAINING.Disabled and Other Ex-Service Men.Statistics.-On the 26th October, 25,024 men were in training, as against 25,071 on the 20th October, and 25,176 on the 29th September. There were 17,198 men awaiting training, the corresponding totals for the 20th October and the 29th September being 17,174 and 18,426 respectively. The number of men whose training had been completed since the 1st August, 1919, was 19,030, the totals for the 20th October and the 29th Sep-tember being 18,521 and 17,234, respectively. Including the 11,000 men estimated to have completed their training under the Ministry of Pensions, a little over 30,000 men have received a full course under the Government.There has again been a slight falling off in the number of men in training. A con-tributory factor is no doubt the gradual increase in the number of terminations, which now averages over 400 a week ; but, having regard to the number awaiting training, it might have been expected that all vacancies would be filled as they occurred. There can be little doubt that the practical closure of new admissions in certain important branches is reflected in the figures. For the first time since early in June there has been an increase, though very small, in the number awaiting training.Full reports on work during September indicate that, while a certain degree of progress is still maintained, the advance is not so marked as would have been the case had the general industrial situation been more hopeful. Large scale training facilities have, up to the present, been more difficult to secure in the Home Counties and the South than in the more distinctly industrial areas of the North and Midlands, but in recent months much has been done, especially in Middlesex, to make good the deficiency. It is evident that almost all Divisional Directors are distinctly anxious about the future. It is increasingly difficult to secure improvership vacancies owing to trade depression, as employers are reducing rather than enlarging their staffs.Of the men in training at the end of September, 27 per cent, were receiving instruc-tion in Government Instructional Factories, 33 per cent, in other institutional centres, and 40 per cent, in employers&apos; workshops.Exhibitions.-Tl\q Bristol area is a difficult one, as there appears to be considerable latent opposition to the training of ex-Service men. It is hoped that the exhibition sanctioned-for the middle of December at the Radnor Road Factory, Bristol, will help to educate local opinion, and to facilitate the work of finding improvership vacancies.Hostels, Canteen and Welfare. Inquiries are being made as to the allowances granted for absence on leave, sickness, etc., at hostels and other residential centres, as it is con-sidered desirable that a uniform system should be adopted.. In certain cases some difficulty is being experienced in making canteens self-supporting. In one case, where the closure of the canteen has been proposed unless better financial results can he shown, it has been suggested that management by a committee of the men in training might be adopted. The canteen at a neighbouring factory is controlled by such a committee,.and results so far appear to be quite satisfactory.Government Instructional Factories. The situation with regard to training facilities in Government Instructional Factories in the Yorkshire Division has greatly improved recently. At Spring Bank, Hull, there are now 68 men in training. Great interest is being taken in the watch and clock and the tailoring classes by the chairmen of the Local Technical Advisory Committees, who are well satisfied with the work. Training has recently been started at Keighley, and there are now 51 men in training at the Townhead Street Factory, Sheffield.In the Essex Division 100 men are in training at the Leytonstone and West Ham Factories, and the work of the bricklaying class is regarded as particularly promising. In the South-Eastern Division, where work was until quite recently seriously handicapped by the lack of factory facilities, two Government Instructional Factories are now at work, training having started at Guildford a few weeks ago, and at Wimbledon during the past week.
Sanction has been given to expenditure upon the purchase of Springfield College, Moseley, Birmingham, with the surrounding grounds, as a training college for manual training instructors in elementary schools.The manager of the Cardiff Factory reports that he has disposed of a number of suits of clothes, boots and shoes to the Comrades of the Great War; he has hopes that this association may prove a useful outlet for many of the factory products.National Trade Advisory Committees: Rair dressing. A meeting of the committee was held on the 21st October, when the scheme for closer liaison between the Ministry of Pensions and the Ministry of Labour in regard to training at convalescent centres was approved in principle. The secretary was instructed to proceed with the establishment of committees for Erith and Romford, with a view to ascertaining the possibilities for classes at these centres.Local Technical Advisory Committees : Engineering. The first meeting of the Reading Local Technical Advisory Committee was held on the 22nd October. The committee were of opinion that some twenty men could probably be absorbed in Reading, and agreed to this number being placed for preliminary training at Portsmouth. It was decided that the area of the committee should be enlarged to include,Slough, Oxford andBasingstoke.Apprenticeships Interrupted by Service.Statistics. Up to the 27th October, agreements had been received at headquarters in respect of 44,434 apprentices under the 41 schemes approved. Grants had been sanctioned in respect of 42,494 apprentices, employed by 16,705 employers. The total number of agreements lapsed on the expiration of the appropriate period of training, or by mutual agreement between the parties, is now 12,432.Wages. In the engineering trades of Portsmouth and Southampton, owing to the slack state of industry and the high rate of wages, several employers regret having brought apprentices under the scheme, and some are doing all they can to get rid of them. Efforts are being made to arrange institutional training for these men at Portsmouth. In other parts of the South-Western area, a few firms urge that they cannot retain their apprentices unless they can be provided with institutional training.In the case of an apprentice who owing to tuberculosis has had to leave Messrs. John Telfer &amp; Sons, Newcastle-on-Tyne, tobacco manufacturers, the firm have already made him presents amounting to  20, and are maintaining his dependants. They regard this as a moral obligation in view of his services in the Forces.Objections are raised, in such trades as glove-making and cooperage, to the non-payment of State grant in respect of piece-work, where the men are earning the stipulated proportions of the prescribed rate. The contention is that, though the firm may lose nothing, the apprentice does, since he would have earned much more but for his military service.Applications. At Edinburgh it is hoped soon to complete all outstanding cases. In the Nottingham lace industry, in spite of the recent strike, the secretary of the &quot;employers&apos; association, acting in close touch with the operatives&apos; representative, arranged for the few outstanding apprentices in&quot; the plain net branch to be brought under the scheme. In the Scottish branch of the industry a long-standing difficulty in fixing the basis for wage payments has been settled. In the Northern area, a number of dental mechanics are unplaced.Non-Observance of Conditions. Strong opposition to carrying out the scheme comes from Messrs. J. Lewis &amp; Sons, Ltd., Aberdeen, engineers and shipbuilders, who have brought all their apprentices under it. Every possible effort has been made to induce them to fulfil their agreement without any success. Action through their federation has also been ineffective, and the withdrawal of men from the firm&apos;s jobs by the union concerned only confirmed them in their obstinacy.Institutional Training.-The special class at the Heriot Watt College at Edinburgh has been sanctioned. At Portsmouth twenty places for institutional training are reported to be available, though a larger number could probably be filled in view of the state of employment in the South-Western area. At Bristol, several engineering firms have recently closed down; it is thought that some, at least, of their apprentices can be sent to Portsmouth.General Training.Apprenticeship (Building). Reports from Yorkshire indicate that, as a rule, firms in country towns see no necessity for the national scheme of the Joint Industrial Council.Appointments and Training-continued.
APPENDIX.QUESTIONS  IN PARLIAMENT.The following extracts from the Official Report of the proceedings of the House of Commons relate to questions in which the Ministry is interested.Wages.Mr. Newbould asked the Prime Minister whether there have been any cases, since the lapsing of the provision of the Industrial Courts Act stabilising war wages on the 30th September last, of reduction of wages in the industries affected.Dr. Macnamara: I have been asked to answer kthis question. I know of one such case. Three or four possible cases of reduction have been brought to my notice. In another case there has been a readjustment of the method of calculating wages, but whether it will involve a reduction in weekly earnings I do not know. My hon. friend will realise that notification of such cases to the Ministry of Labour is not required by statute.-(28th October.)Joint Industrial Councils.Mr. Jesson asked the Minister of Labour if, having regard to the fact that an increase in our annual production of wealth is essential before we can solve the problems of high prices, heavy taxation, unemployment, and labour unrest; and that increased production must be accompanied with either higher wages or lower prices to prevent gluts; and that before any increase in production can be obtained a better understanding between employees and employers and the thorough organisation of every industry must be established, he will consider the advisability of introducing legislation for the compulsory establishmentThere seems no general difficulty in getting apprentices, and the size of the firms renders personal supervision easy, while facilities for institutional training are lacking. At Leicester, the Master Builders&apos; Association decline to consider the scheme till an un-authorised strike at Rugby is settled. A large Burnley firm, who approve the scheme generally, consider that apprentices should be paid on the basis, not of age, but of the length of training.Training (Engineering). Encouraging reports are received regarding a scheme for training in civil, electrical and mechanical engineering, inaugurated in 1919 by the Bradford Technical College Engineering Advisory Committee, a joint body composed of representa-tives of employers and workpeople. The scheme is designed to fulfil the requirements of the new Education Act and to furnish complete courses of training for boys of varying capacity. It is considered desirable for firms to employ boys between 14 and 16 on light work in the shops, when their suitability for the industry is carefully considered. At 16, on passing a simple examination, they are formally indentured for five years, and attend the Technical College one half-day per week. At 18, a further examination is held, to determine whether an apprentice shall continue his trade apprenticeship, qualify to enter a higher grade, or receive a full university course. This examination also decides whether an apprentice shall become a civil, electrical or mechanical engineer. The committee consider that, in all three branches, it is best for boys from 16 to 18 to receive the ordinary workshop training of a trade apprentice. Fears are, however, expressed by the managing director of an important firm that the inclusion of electrical engineering may cause some promising mechanical engineers to take up the easier and less important electrical work.Messrs. Siemens Bros., Ltd., Woolwich, electrical engineers, have instituted special classes at a local London County Council School on three evenings per week for boys under 16, providing instruction in both general and trade subjects. Demonstrations are given of the working of finished instruments upon the manufacture of which the lads are engaged and also practical demonstrations of the treatment and character of metals, of acetylene and ordinary welding, and of blacksmiths&apos; work. Three courses are given, an intro-ductory course, a general technical course, and a two years&apos; instrument-making course.[Reference to matters of interest to the Appointments and Training Departments will also be found on pages 529, 532, 538, 539, 541, 542 and 545.]
Appendix- continued.of industrial councils or trade parliaments in every industry in this country, upon which both sides are equally represented, such bodies to have power to enforce all agreements concerning wages and conditions of employment upon the whole of their respective in-dustries, subject to representatives of the Government being allowed to serve upon those bodies to watch and safeguard the interests of the consumers.Dr. Macnamara: On the question of compulsory enforcement of agreements, I would refer my hon. friend to the answer given to him by my predecessor on the 8th March,* a copy of which I am sending him. The agreement of opinion between employers and work-people on this subject, to which my right hon. friend refers, does not yet exist. I should certainly like to see in every industry, either a Trade Board or a Joint Industrial Council, or failing that some equivalent machinery for dealing, not merely with wages matters and subjects of disputes, but with all matters affecting the well-being of the industry. But apart from the fact that many industries, being comparatively unorganised, are unsuitable for joint industrial councils, I do not think that the element of compulsion which he. advocates-cates would tend to secure industrial peace. (28th October.)Trade Boards Act (Catering Trade).Mr. Raper asked the Home Secretary if he is aware of the conditions prevailing in certain tea shops in the City, where the girl assistants are paid a total wage of about 12s. 6a!. per week; and, if so, why these tea shops are allowed to keep open.Sir M. Barlow: I have been asked to reply. The attention of this department has been called to the alleged low wages prevailing in certain branches of the catering trade, and investigations are proceeding at present with a view to setting up a Trade Board or Boards for this trade with as little delay as possible. As my hon. friend is aware, the Trade Board or Boards when established will have the duty of fixing minimum rates of wages for workers in tea shops and other catering establishments. (26th October.)Labour Disputes.&quot; Mr. Rawlinson asked the Prime Minister whether, having regard to the enormous injury caused to all classes in the country by strikes during the present critical period of the nation&apos;s history, he will forthwith bring in legislation either amending the Trades Disputes Act or for the purpose of prohibiting men from striking before they have sub-mitted their grievance to some independent tribunal.. Sir M. Barlow: I have been asked to reply. Legislation for the adjustment of labour disputes requires, for success, a substantial amount of support from both organised em-ployers and workpeople. The Industrial Courts Act of 1919, which carries out a number of the recommendations of the Report of the Committee on Relations between Employers and Employed, better known as the Whitley Committee, embodies the present policy of the Government on the matters raised by my hon. and learned friend. In this connection I would observe that that Committee definitely reported against any compulsory powers for delaying strikes and lock-outs.-(26^ October.)DEBATES IN PARLIAMENT.Port of London Authority (Consolidated) Bill.The Bill was read for a second time in the House of Commons on the 28th October. Mr. A. Short, moving that the Bill be read on that day three months, raised the question of the decasualisation of dock labour, and claimed that labour should receive greater representation on the Port of London Authority. Mr. Wignall supported the claim on the grounds of the &quot; brutal conditions of employment &quot; in and about the London docks. Mr. Gilbert claimed that something had been done to improve matters; a permanent weekly staff of over 4,000 had been established, and the findings of Lord Shaw&apos;s Report had been loyally carried out, except in so far as they were still under consideration by employers and employed. Mr. J. Jones and Mr. Sexton both recognised the value of the Authority&apos;s work from the commercial point of view, but pressed the question of decasualisa-tion and the representation of labour on the Authority. Mr. Sexton described the clearing-house system in Liverpool, administered by the Ministry of Labour, which had abolished the &quot;degrading system of the ready-money job.&quot; He urged the general establishment of clearing-houses, and of a maintenance scheme during unemployment.!* See this Report, No. 8, 20th March, p. 287.f See this Report, Vol. II, No. 13, 25th September, p. 383.
