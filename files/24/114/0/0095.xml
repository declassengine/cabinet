War Office,London, S.W*10th Novoiabcr, 1920.121/L.of nations/3&amp;.(D.JM.(Hevaive3 in Office?, of the Cabinet November 13th.)SirTith reference to Admiralty letter No*M.03128 of November let, 1920, 1 ar commanded by the Amy Council to say that they concur with the opinion of the British ftaval, Military and Air Reprer-entativoo on the Permanent Advisory Conmisoio?: of th^ League fif Nations that the essential pointr? to be consid^r^d in framing th^ organisation to exercise th* ri/tfit of investigation referred to in Article 213 of the Treaty of Peace of Versailles and corresponding Articles in other Treaties are at? stated in paragraph ? of the Memorandum dated 23rd October 1920 by the British Naval, Military and Air representatives.2.   I am commanded also to a ay that the Council concur in the suggestions made in paragraph 10 of the Memorandum referred to above, with the proviso that local attaches should not be members      rih of Commissions of Investigation.     The reason which animates the Council in forming this opinion is that they consider it essential that the Military Attache should be in eloe^ touch and on good terms with the War Office and other Kilitary Authorities of the country to which h** is accredited, a position which ho would probably find it impossible to maintain if h^ were also a member of a Committee which nay w-\ll have to *&amp;tort information from an unwilling Gcvfsrnm^nt.1 amSirYour obedient Servant(Signed)   H.
