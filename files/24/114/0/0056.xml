C.P. 2056.

CONTRACTS FOR THE SUPPLY OF GOODS TO SOVIET RUSSIA.

Attorney-General&apos;s Opinion on Case submitted by the Board of Trade.

(Circulated by request of the President, Board of Trade, with reference to C.P. 1890).

As contracts are being negotiatod between certain firms of the United Kingdom and the Russian Agency in London, to consign certain goods to Reval, which is not within the area to which the prohibition on exportation to Russia relates, the Attorney-General has been asked for his opinion on the following points:-

A. If the firm that makes the contract (a) knows (b) does not know that the goods are in fact destined for Russia has he committed any offence

1. by contracting to sell the goods

2. by contracting to ship the goods to Revel or any other port not in Soviet Russia

(Is either contract either (a) fully legal or (b) illegal in the sense of unenforceable or (c) illegal in the further sense of being an offence),

or

3. by shipping the goods to Reval or any other non-Russian port when no license has been obtained.

B. Have the Customs any legal power to prevent shipment to Reval or any non-Russian port.

1. if satisfied that the goods are destined ultimately for Russia

or,

2. pending proof on the part of the shipper that they are not so destined.

The following opinion has been given by the Attorney-General :-

"In answer to the questions submitted to me, assuming that Reval is not a port to which export is prohibited, I think:

A. The firm has not committed any offence by contracting to sell ? goods, or by contracting to ship them to Reval or to any other port ? which exportation is not prohibited, or by shipping goods to any
such port, though the ultimate destination may be one to which exportation is prohibited. If, however, the firm knows when the Contract is made that the destination of the goods is a place to which exportation is prohibited, the contract is, I think, void and unenforceable, but is not illegal in the sense of being an offence.

B. No.
