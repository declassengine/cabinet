Note by the Secretary, Cabinet.

With reference to Cabinet 30(20), Conclusion (2), I circulate to the Cabinet the attached urgent telegram received from Sir A. Geddes on the subject of the Anglo-American Debt.   As the Chancellor of the Exchequer wishes to bring up this question for further discussion on the earliest possible occasion,  the item will be placed on the Agenda for the Conference of Ministers to be held on Monday, November 1st, 1980, at 4,0 p.m

Paraphrase ox   tolegram Wo, 717 from  Sir A * Ooddos, ^Washington, October 23rd, 1920.Urgent and very; oqnf ldential,The question of funding British War Debt to America is one which deserves tho closest examination end I feel I must draw the immediate personal attention of Your Lordship to it. Itshould be settled at the earliest opportunity.Last,,June you will remember tho two exchequers had almost come to terms but e complete settlement was prevented at the last moment,   I understood at the time that communication on the subject would be set Up between the President and the Prime Minister.On August 18th a letter was received of which though I was promised a copy I have never received one ( see telegram of August 21st from mo).   This letter w- s handed to tho President immediately after its reooapt but 1 do not know if the President ever replied to it,    I do not know exactly how matters stand at the present moment though I do know that negotiations have been temporarily stopped, &apos; A settlement now would be in British interests and I fear we may not make use of the opportunity.If you refer to the second and third paragraph hs of my telegram No. 458 you will see that I have laid particular stress on tho necessity of keeping the whole matter out of Congress and that I have advocated negotiations between the two Treasuries as the best method of settlement.     I am not aware of any great change in the position at present though subsequent to the elections there may be radical alterations.It ivi not likely thai a satisfactory agreement will be. oomo
opnio to during tho last two months of the present administration if a iisssi&amp;fcfost-republic&quot;nominee is elected and during tho first period of Office of a rev; republican administration the corning to of an agreement would bo equally difficult.Senator Harding stated in a speech on October 8th that it waa possible excess profits might bo reduce (Li! Amerlaa^-s-f or-esgn-,, loans wore readjusted in such a way that Allies would pay off their loan at a fixed term in negotiable liiuropcan bonds.,Tho election pledges which the Republicans will have given should thoy-oomo in will-.greatly harrpor-any negotiations, on., this question which tho x might wish to make since they propose to compete with industrial and economic disturbance with somo scheme such as had boon already outlined-,Harriman Banking interests are inserting full pageadvertisements in the newspapers urging tho necessity of replacing the present payable on demand debt of the Allies by an obligationpayable at a fixed date.     They want a re-issue of the debt asbonds with an &quot;attractive&quot; rate of interest - these to be exchangedfor Liberty Bonds and they also hope for frosh investors.What they really want, in short, is for a large number ofprivate investors to take tho place of United States Treasury -this would not bo satisfactory for us and would to a large extentdo away with any hope of making a satisfactory--fttnd:Jng.-arrangoment,It seems to me most desirable that the two Treasur:Len.-,-should.time at once put into operation a draft arrangement - there is/still before November 2nd - and unless there is somo  ,oint of view with which I am not cognisant I can see nothing against -this lino of act ion
