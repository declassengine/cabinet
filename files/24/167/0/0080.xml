Note by  the President of the Board of Trade.     The Lord Privy Seal, the Home Soorotary and I  (to whomthe matter was referred by tho Cabinet) have ooneidered thocomposition of this Committee.  We oame to the conclusion,after considering numerous alternatives, that the Chairmanshipshould be offered to Sir Arthur Balfour, KcB^E., who has  iustvacated the presidency of the Associated Chambers of Commerce.As time pressed, I was empowered to approach him privately inorder to ascertain whether, if the proposal wero definitelymade to him,  he would be able to aooopt.     We were  also of opinion that the other suggested membersof the Committee should be confirmed; but that an additionalTrade Union representative should be added for iron and steel,and he might  be Mr. W.J. Baker, of the British Iron and SteelTrades Confederation.  It is also suggested that Mr. Pybusmight be asked to represent Electrical industries.     We doubted the necessity of including any representativeof the ooal export trade, the name suggested being  that ofSir John Hindley.     I append the complete list as now suggested, for final approval, together with the terms of referenoe and  explanatory memorandum. If approved, I propose that they should be broughtto the notice  of the Unionist and Liberal V/hips, and alsoSir Arthur Shirley Benn and Sir George croydon Marks (moverand seoonder  of resolution).(Intld.)

flonfiae-ntjal.Memorandum on proposed Inquiry into Industry and Trade.     With regard to the proposed Committee to inquire into industry and Trade, the following terras of reference havebeen suggested          &quot;To  inquire into and report upon the conditions     and prospeots of British industry and oommeroe, with     special reforenoe to the export trade, and to make     recommendations in regard thereto&quot;.     It has further been suggested that the soope of thetorms of reference should be on the general lines set out inthe three following paragraphs and that these should bepublished at the same time as the torms of reference withan intimation that they are intended as explanatory of theaubjoots on whioh investigation is specially desired andnot as an exhaustive definition of the inquiry          &quot;The first question to which the attention of the     Committee should be directed is the present position    , of British overseas trade and the prospect of British     participation in the markets of the world being such     as to ensure sufficient and continuous employment and     a satisfactory standard of living in this country. The     examination of tendencies and developments in the     markets of the world and also in the ohief competing     countries will be involved together with an inquiry     into the growth of competition with British goods in     theso markots, tho likelihood of its continuance, and     its probable consequenoes.          The second question ia the ability of British                                                    t     industry to meet competition under the conditions thus     determined and to adapt itself to changes in the
nature of overseas demand.  This involves an inquiry into British productive oapaoity and organisation,including the supply and efficiency of capital, labourand management, the present and future adequacy of rawmaterials and possible improvements in their utilisationand the part played by the United Kingdom In new developments of industry, particularly those whioh aretho outcome of scientific researoh.  Matters to which attention might be direoted are the present extent oflargo scale production? its possibilities and limitations\the efficiency of plant and equipment/ power supply andtransport as faotors in oost of production? marketingorganisation at home and abroad) and the current methodsof Industrial and commercial, finanoe.  It will beneoessary, in addition, to take aocount of the effectof State regulative action upon costs and output.     The third question Is that of the relations between those engaged in production.  This will involve inquiry into methods of industrial remuneration, the mainoauses of unrest and disputes, and tho methods ofavoidance or settlement of disputes, as, for example,oo-partnorship, oo-operation, Wages Boards and voluntaryarbitration, State regulation or wages, and compulsory arbitration and^compulsory enforcement and extent!oneof agreements&quot;.
