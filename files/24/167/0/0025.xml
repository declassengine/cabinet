(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; S GOTORMMT)SECRET.                                    COPY No.&amp;l ^                                                        v  /CP.534 (24).                        CABINET.                    DEVOLUTION.               Memorandum by the Lord Privy Seal.           My colleagues will recollect that on Friday, the 9th    instant, a debate took place in the House of Commons on a    Private Bill brought forward by Mr.Buchanan for the grant    of a form of Home Rule to 8ootland.   On that occasion the    Seoretary for Scotland was the Government spokesman,   and    was authorised to indicate that the Government gave their    approval to the general principle involved in the Bill, but    that as they recognised that it raised a large and vital    issue for this country as well as for Scotland, they felt    that the most appropriate prooedure would be the appointment    of a Committee to examine the whole question and to report to    the House.   It was further suggested that the constitution of    this Committee should be arranged through the usual channels.           Since that date I have been in consultation with  the    Secretary for Scotland, the Home Seoretary and the Minister of    Health on the question of the terms of reference to be given to    the body which it is proposed to set up to examine this    question.   The views of the various Departments are  embodied    :in the following formula, which appears to me to meet the case    and which, I invite the Cabinet io approve.                &quot;To consider Hie formulation of a scheme           whereby the responsibility for administrative  and           legislative matters relating solely to England,           Scotland or Wales respectively should devolve  upon           National Governments and legislatures, the powers           of such Governments and their relations with the           Imperial Government, the nature and construction of           suoh legislatures, their relation to the Imperial           Parliament, their financial powers and the soope           of their jurisdiction and functions, and to report&quot;                            -1-
      The  question  of  the nature of  the body to be appointedraises, in my  judgment, questions of greater difficulty,which had not  been considered in detail at the time whenthe Secretary  for  Scotland made the statement to whioh Ihave  referred.  The last occasion on which the principle of devolution was examined was in 1919, when a joint Committeeof both Houses of  Parliament was appointed under theChairmanship of the late Speaker,  Lord Ullswater.  that body was not fruitful of useful results,  ana I do not recommend that a similar Committee should be re-appointed.Squally I do not favour the appointment of a Select Committeeof the House of Commons, though the words used by theSecretary for Sootland might perhaps be read to Imply thatthat was the intention of the Government.   Indeed,  Iunderstand, that that was his intention at the time.   ACommittee of this character seems  to me to entail suchserious disadvantages as to render it quite unsuitable for the present purpose.     I confess I am doubtful whether an enquiry of  so momen-tous a character and entailing such far-reaching effects is appropriate to a body composed of  avowed  partisans,  who couldnot fail to approach the subject on the lines of their part convictions.  If however such a body were suitable,I see strong objections to an arrangement whioh in  existingcircumstances would be inevitable, whereby the Governmentof the day would only be represented by a small minority.Moreover an enquiry of this kind wouia undoubtedly
  be  of  a  complicated and  protracted  character and  in view  of the fact  that Select Committees automatically lapse  on the  dissolution of  Parliament, it might well happen that^ after months of enquiry such  a Committee might be interrupted in its work, and never be able  to report.      Apart however from the merits, the attitude of the Conservative  Party at the present time renders the appointment of such a Committee  impossible.  I have learnt through the usual channels that the  Conservative Leaders have decided to adopt towards the proposed  Select  Committee to investigate the Poor Lav/ the same  attitude as that which they took in relation to the similar Committee proposed to investigate the claims  of 3x-Ranker  Officers  and  to refuse  to nominate Members thereto-   I see no reason to doubt that they would  adopt  the same attitude  if asked to serve  on a Committee in regard  to  Devolution.   In such a matter the  Government ar:;  of  course  entirely  at the mercy of the Opposition.  It remains therefore to consider what other  type  of tody is best  suited for the  present enquiry.     After  giving this  matter careful  consideration I  have formed the  conclusion that  it  could  be best  dealt with  by  the appointment of a Royal  Commission.  Such  a Commission  should be strictly limited  in  numbers,  strong in its composition, and  generally of a character to command national approval.  I feel  convinced  that only by such means could  proposals  involving such great constitu- tional  changes,be formulated  with any chance  of  ultimately being passed  into law.
