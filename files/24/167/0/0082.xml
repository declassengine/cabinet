In the  course of their exunimtion of the problem           of  Electrical  Development in Great Britain,  the CoEir.ittee-           have  heard the evidence of Sir John Snail,  the Chairman snt        of  the Electricity Commiesion, and of Mr.C.H.Merz,  the. t-ion                                                        &apos; Future     eminent Consulting Electrical Engineer.apects4?   The Committee have also had before them memoranda on various aapeote of the problem prepared by theElectricity Comniasigners and others and they have alsoheard the views of Lord St,Davids, the Chairman of theUnemployment Grants Committee on a specific proposalsubmitted to them by the Electricity Commissioners.5,   At the outset of their enquiry,, the Committee were impressed iiith the evidence of Great britain a inferiorityin electrical development as compared with other countries and particularly with the electrical development of herforeign commercial competitors.   This inferiority isthe more remarkable in aa much as in certain highly important respects Great Britain is distinctly ahead ofother countries.6,   The relatively backward position of Great Britainelectrically may he attributed to many different causes.Among others which may be mentioned are  the  absence oflarge water power resources, the existence of a verylarge, fully developed and  active gao industry, thefailure in the past of industry to appreciate theadvantages of electrical operation, and possibly mostimportant of all, the mistaken policy followed in theyears after the passing into law of the Electricity.Supply Act 1888 of allowing tha generation of electricityto&quot;proceed on parochial lines, the consequence of whichIs that there has sprung up ail o\s r the country anumber of very small and consequently inefficient stations
erected on different frequencies for-the purpose of serving their immediate neighbourhood and -without reference to future possibilities or national interestsj  -in the result * out&apos; of 532 publio utility stations inGreat Britain (of which 71 are owned by Railway or TramAuthorities 5, no less than tso-thirde are very smallstations, the majority of which ought to be closed andthe electricity produced by more modern methods.     The Committee are advised that in a oountry likeGreat Britain, whioh must depend mainly upon fuel firedstations, the principal economy can be effected by eon-oentrating the production in larger and properly placed,generating stations.   The policy of the EleotrioityCommies ioners^has consistently been to encourage theconstruction of such modern,stations, to educate thesmaller authorities, both municipal and company In theadvantages to be derived.in closing down their smalllocal stations and buying in bulk from 1he larger stations and also to encourage new applications from both muni-oipalities  and companies for special Distribution orders in districts not now  served, advising suoh bodies to dispense with looal generation if they can obtain supplies in bulk at a reasonable cost from the larger stations.sQ.  The*Ilectrieity Supply Act of 1919 has undoubtedlydone much to remedy the general position and the following figures indicate the substantial improvement in thesituation which has taken place since 1919,   The capital invested in Electricity Supply undertakings has risen fromapproximately  99 millions in 1919 to  144 millions in1922, an increase of 43 per cent,   Generating plant hasincreased in three years by 60 per cent and the numberof units generated has increased by 24 per cent in thesame period.   Indeed, the power plant installed orauthorised by the Electricity Commissioners will give
  an electrical production in  the aggregate  in excess of  the estimated requirements of  the  oountry  In 1930.   9,   The Committee  ere informed  that  the  Electricity  Commissioners find very great  difficulty in inducing  undertakersj  whether municipal or  company,  to  undertake  works of any magnitude with  a  view to  actual provision  &quot;being made  to meet the possible-demand a few years  ahead.  This reluctance  ia not necessarily cue to  lack of enters-  price,  since  it  must he  remembered that large  expenditure  which at the moment  is not necessary,  might at any time  be rendered out  of date by some  new development in  generation  or  transmission and thus become a burden on&apos;  the  industry.    The  opposition to  reorganisation  sation is also  due  to  the  reluctance  of  the smaller authorities to close  their local stations and  purchase     electricity in bulk  from another  source, or to agree  to the transfer of  their stations  to a  Joint Authority and to the fact that  the  larger  Authorities and  the Power Companies regard  themselves  in the main as  self-sufficient  and  are averse  to any  form of  co-operative  efforts which  involve inter-  ferenoe with  their powers  and  aspirations.   The experts  are  unanimous  in the view that if  electricity  in Great  Britain is  to be brought  in  advance of other countries,  as assuredly  it  should be, having  regard to Britain&apos;a----material resources and densely populated areas,  it  will be  necessary to  obtain  much  greater  oo-ordination of effort   ,  and  far more  readiness must  be shown to subordinate  local to national interests  than has been  the  case  in  the  paut
                                                               1  37:irflCY        lf^*   Ths Comrnittaft ars  adritfod that the Ideal *9^iMsrtfi,URDIS1T10H.            for  is on.fi  standard frequency throughout the oountry,            the  large generating  stations erected on the Clyde,            Tyne, Tees, Horsey, Don,  Sevorn,  Trent  aid the Thames,            in Ucrth Wales  and at appropriate points on the South            Coast heing all interconnected with arterial cables and            fwrming adequate reserves for even the  largest industries            and  for railway electrification,  and that the first            step should aim at securing the adoption by the non-            standard areas  of the British standard  frequency of            fifty cycles per second,  the standard also in use on            the  Continent and in  Australia and Canada.  To secure            standardisation throughout  the country  it will be            necessary to alter the present frequencies on the North-            East coast, on  the Clyde, in Birmingham, in parts of            London and  in South Wales.   The  change-over in non-            stendard areas  will entail considerable orders for            new  electrical  machinery giving work to skilled men.            The  electrical  advantages of the  proposal are two-fold.            In the first place, standardisation will enable            electrical  manufacturers, to reduce the  number of their            stocks and  patterns,  thus cheapening products and            assisting manufacturers  to compete with other eeuntriesf            3econdly, interconnection of the  capital generating            stations throughout the  country will be greatly            facilitated^  The policy of station interconnection            means greatly increased  efficiency and  economy and            will enable cheaper electrical power to be supplied            in adequate quantity.            11.   The Committee are  convinced of  the supreme            importance  of adopting the  policy of standardisation            if practicable  and they have accordingly authorised            the  Commissioners to  arrange with Mr. Merz to make a            survey and  special report on the  non-standard frequency
areas.    It is hoped that the report will ho available by october and will oover questions suoh as the probableoost of the policy and the nature and extent of thedifficulties, if any, to its realisation.   Mr.Merz&apos;sreport  will also deal with the question of the capacityof the  electricity industry in Great Britain to undertake the various schemes contemplated in this report and alsothe question of the possible rise in prices in the eventof the  policy being adopted, and will contain suggestions for safeguarding the public interest in this respect.12.   It is understood that conplote frequency standard-isation would probably take about three years to carryout.   As the change-over will confer no direct benefiton those interested in the production t:.nd consumption ofelectricity it will be impossible to carry out the reformexcept  on the basis of the whole of the direct cost ofthe provision and instalment of the new machinery beingassumed by the  tate.  &apos;.t present the Goromittee cannotgive a  closer estimate of this cost than the very roughapproximation of  10,000,000 which has been tentativelysuggested to them.13.   The Cabinet will appreciate that,pending Mr.Kerz:senquiry and the subsequent examination of the report, itwill not bo practicable to make any announcement of policy regarding frequency standardisation except in very general terms.14,   The Committee recomnend:-            That the announcement on the subject of            frequency standardisation should take the            form of a statement to the effect that the            Government have been advised that as an            essential preliminary to extensive and            co-ordinated electrical development in            Great Britain it will be advisable to            standardise the frequencies throughout the            country.   ,ith a view to the earliest possible            decision being taken the Government h&amp;ve            arranged for an expert Report on the whole            matter to be furnished forthwith, ,  If the            Report in question is favourable the Government            will then be prepared to consider whether a            substantial proportion, if not the whole,            of-the cost should be borne by publio funds.
 15,,   The second direction in which the electrical, equipment of  this country might be accelerated, by State action is in the laying of main transmission lines.   To produce electricity cheaply it is nece-ssary to concentrate its generation in large stations and distribute it at high tension  to sub-stations.   Furthermore, to avoid keeping a large reserve plant standing idle at each station for emergency purposes it is desirable to have these main stations inter-connected. 16.   The high cost of tranmission lines is a great obstacle to such development and tends to cause such works to be delayed until they are immediately profitable.   If, however, electrical  development is to be accelerated the laying of these cables should be undertaken well in- advance of immediate requirements,  and the Committee consider that this is a suitable field for State assistance. 17.   On the advice of the Electricity Commissioners the Committee consider that the local authorities or companies undertaking such works individually or jointly be given a grant  making net revenue (after allowing for depreciation or sinking funds)  attributable  to       up  ;                 the line/to  a rate of interest  (approved .by the Treasury) cn their expenditure  until such time as  the  net revenue  is sufficient to  meet this charge  or for 10 years whichever  is less.18.   In cases in whioh it is desired,  to open up a  new districtelectrically it  may not be sufficient  to cover  the  interest only onthe main transmission line and  It may  be necessary,  if  the scheme isto proceed,  to Include the distribution system  as well in the grant.The Committee must warn the Cabinet that the rate  of  grant suggestedin paragraph 17  above represents, for  the  full  10 year  period (on the 5% basis) 59% of the  capital  outlay.   The  Committee arereluctant to recommend payment  of grant  at  so high  a  rate,  particularly in the case  of distribution systems if this can be  avoided,and theyconsider that applications under paragraph 18 above should only  be entertained  if It can be conclusively  shown that alternative  methods of Government assistance (such,  for example, as the  ordinarygrants of the Unemployment Grants Committee) are insufficient to secure the carrying out of the  scheme  as a  whole.
he Committee recommend therefore:-1) That, the Electricity Commissioners  be  authorised  ^   to hold a Conference of the  Incorporated   Municipal Electrical Association, the   Association of Power Companies  and  of  the   Provincial Supply Committee  of  Great  Britain   with a view to securing the  maximum possible   development of the main transmission  system   on the terms outlined in the following   scheme, but that they should have discretion   in the event of it appearing that an  adequate   extension of such lines into new districts   cannot be secured without more  generous   terms for the distribution system to  include   expenditure on distribution  lines within the   100/? interest  grant in cases in which they are   satisfied that desirable extension  cannot be   secured without further assistance.2) Scheme.   (a)  Work to be assisted to  be  main transmission        lines as defined in Section 36 of the        Electricity Supply Act  1919 and  subject,        as mentioned in (l) above, to  substantial.        schemes of distribution in areas  where        electricity is not available.   (b)  The work must be of a kind which  the under-        takers have no intention in the  near future        of carrying out with their own resources        and must not be accelerated work in the        ordinary sense or mere  additions  to or        extensions of schemes already  in  operation.   (c)  The financial assistance to be given to        consist of a grant to local authorities*&apos;       cr companies undertaking&apos; approved works        individually or jointly sufficient  in amount        to make up the net revenue (after allowing        for depreciation on sinking funds)  attributable        to the particular work  to  a rate  of  interest        (approved by the Treasury) on  the expenditure        incurred until such time as the        net revenue is sufficient  to meet this charge,      &apos;  or for ten. years whichever is  less.  , (d)  Steps must be taken to  emphasise  the wholly        exceptional character of the electrical grants        and to keep those grants separate and distinct        from the system of grants  administered by the       - Unemployment Grants Committee, and  in order        to maintain this distinction the  electrical        Grants should not, in the  Committee1s opinion,        be administered by that Committee.  &apos;
&apos;I$MJ5HT       &amp;*  ,5Dlie Electricity Commissioners have strongly re-LliPlES i?02?SU1&apos;I0N    presented to the Committee that tho Government should give          facilities for the passage of the Commissioners&quot; Order for          London-and the Home Counties Electridity District, of the          two  London Company Electrical Bills, the Horth Metropolitan          Power Bill, the County of London Corapany&apos;s  Bill for Essex,          the  Yorkshire Power Bill, the Grampians Water power and          the  Lanark Water Power Bills.          21,.  The Cabinet -are no  doubt aware that after prolonged          and  difficult negotiations a settlement has at last been           effected which, in the opinion of the  Commissioners; is          a highly advantageous settlement from  the point of view           of efficient future development in the London electrical           area and also of the public interest.   The  Committee           are  informed that if the opposition to the  proposed Order  .           is successful, there will be a permanent set&apos;back to           development and the reorganisation^of  the industry which          will be felt not only in London but all over the country.          Moreover, the purchase of the Companies will be postponed;.           to 1931;  development will be stayed in the areas of the           Companies concerned and  while the nature and amount of           the  compensation to-be payable in 1931 under the Electric           Lighting Act of 1888 is  problematical  it seems&apos; clear that           the  present arrangements will mean a saving on the 1931-           terms ofyat least  250,000 per annum,  while, moreover,-           the  proposed Order lays  down definitely and clearly the           basis on which compensation will have  to be paid in           1S71 when the undertakings of the Companies will pass           into the hands of the Joint Electricity Authority.
a i o 22.      In  the  course  of  discussions which have taken placo  between the Committee and deputations from the General  Council of the  Trades Union Congress and tho London labour Members it has become obvious to the Committee that very strenuous opposition to the proposed Order and legislation mast be expected from the supporters of tho Government.   In this connection it has been pointed out that any delay in bringing the legislation and Order Into operation on an early date must have a very serious effect on tho provision for immediate employments   In  these circumstances the  Committee feel doubtful as  to the praticability of complying with the  representations of the Electricity Commissioners at the present moment and they accordingly recommend:-23c    (l)   That tha Minister  of Transport  should            be authorised  to endeavour  to re-open            negotiations with  the  parties concerned            with a  view to seeing  whether it may            not  be  possible to obtain  terms more            favourable  to  the  public  than those at            present  contemplated in the Electricity            Commissioners  draft  Order,  particularly            with a view to expediting the time  when            the  various  undertakings will be            transferred  to  the  Joint Electricity            Authority.

BUS X.USC-    24;.   The Committee has examined  the question whetherKIOII&apos;YCOKKlSSIOtf-  it will be desirable to confer  on  the electricityCOMPULSORY   Commissioners coapulsbry powers similar  to  those origin-JCSSKS.            ally inserted in the 1919 Bill,  Expert  opinion inclines            to the view that in the long run  the highest interests            of the country end of  the electricity industry will  be-            better served by arrangements reached as at present  by            means of voluntary negotiation  rather than  by resorting            to compulsory powers.   Having  regard to this considera-                                IB            tion and to the- difficulty  of passing amending legislan            tion of a contentious  character on this  subject, the            Committee recommend:-                 That for the present  no alteration should                 be made in  the existing&apos; statutory  position                 of the powers of the  Electricity Commission.RilLiiiY       .25, she Committee have considered the  general questionOJiCTHIPI-           *CiTlCll.      of Railway electrification  and  have been assured that            with regard to main line, as distinct from  suburban            line, electrification,the general attitude  of the            Railway Companies is in favour  of  postponement.    The            reluctance of the Companies to  electrify is, the Committee            are informed by Mr.Mera, based  on  the fact  that the  full            financial benefits of  electrification will  only begin to            materialise after a considerable   j                                -11-
portion of the whole railway system has been convertedfrom steam to electricity.  Electrification will involvea complete re-arrangement of all railway time tablesand undoubtedly revolutionary changes in railway methods and management.  While, no doubt, certain of the companies are electrifying their local and suburban lines, and while tils policy may be extended in the future in response to  the demand of the public, it is improbable,the Committee are advised, that the goneral policy ofthe Hallway  Companies towards main line electrificationwill undergo substantial alteration until their staffsinclude a &quot;&quot;much larger and mpro influential olectricalelement than is the case at present.26.  The attitude of the Railway Companies might be materially influenced if  the Prime Minister were todiscuss the  position with the Companies but in any casethe Government could hardly present a complete statement to Parliament without having explored the situation tothe fullest  extent.27.  Having  regard  to all the circumstances the committee recommend:-          that the Prime Minister should          be requested to confer with the          Railway Companies within the nest          10 days.
28.     In the course of their ersaraination of the questionof afforestation, the Committee have heard evidence from^rd lovat, the Chairman of the Forestry Commission theMinister of Agriculture and Fisheries and the Chairman of theSoptstish Board of Agriculture and have also consideredMemoranda and other documents submitted to them by the ForostryCommission, Sir William Haldane and others-29.     AS the Cabinet will no doubt realise, it is impossibleto deal with Afforestation as e means of relievingUnemployment,  except as part of the larger Question cfAfferestation Jcliey.   It has accordingly been necessaryto review the Forestry arrangements which have been inoperation since the War, and as a result of careful am-sideration of the matter the Committee submit to the Cabinetthe suggestions and recommendations contained in the following.paragraphs.30.     3he Cabinet will remember that the Forestry Sub-         i                                   -Committee&apos;of the Eecons truetion Committee (She Acland Committee),contemplated that in 60 years 1,770,000 acres shsuld baafforested and that in the first 10 years,  thero  should baplanted 850,600 acres, of which 150,COO acres should beplanted by direct ^tate action.   The rate of planting wasto be nil in the first or preparatory year, and te wor3r upby ecpzal annual increments cf 3,300 acres per annum to 30,000acres in the 10th year,*31.     fhe Forestry Commissioners were appointed on the29th November 1919 under the Forestry Act of  that year,and at the outset the Commissioners were able somewhat to accelerate the 150,000 acre programme;  the programme was,however, upset as the result of the decision  taken by theCabinet in 1921 (after the Committee on National   %Expenditure had reported) to limit the planting programme  tvAFFORBSTAfflOfl
 10,000  acres per annum.   By accelerating the present rate of planting to the extent of 4,200 acres per annum the 150,000 acre programme can however be carried out in the 10 year period originally contemplated.   Since their establishment the Commissioners have actually themselves planted about 38,000 acres. 32.     The rate at which Afforestation can be accelerated is limited by three main factors -        (a)  Adequate finance.        (b)  Adequate supplies of suitable plants,  which            on the  average require to be three years  rid before            planting out,   and        (a)  The availability of land for planting, which            must necessarily be acquired some time in            advance in order that it may be properly            prepared and ripe for planting at the  proper            time. 33.     There are,  of course, other faotors such as the pre- vision of trained technical staff,  whioh must not  be  over- looked.                      &quot;  . 34.     $he Committee are  generally of opinion that it  is desirable to revert to the arrangements originally contemplated by tho Acland Committee and the Forestry Commission and  to carry out the 150,000 acre programme within the  10 years ending 1928/29..   If this  general conclusion is  accepted by the Cabinet,  steps will have to be taken  to make good the deficiency in the amount of land whioh  the Commissionerswill require;  in other words, it will be necessary for the Commissioners to acquire  on the average  45,000 to 50, COS acres of pi an table  lana in each of the next 5 years. this estimated area is based  on the  assumption that a given estate will not be completely planted up in  less than 10 years.    To avoid instability in local employment and  for adequate technical  reasons, this period cannot be  shortened.
                                                      3 6 335.     The Committee sre informed by the Forestry commission that  they have always been in favour of the creation ofsmall holdings adjacent to all areas te be planted.  Fromthe Commissions point of view it is highly desirable tosettle permanent forect workers on part-time holdingsadjacent to the forest, rather than to depend entirely forforestry operations upon temporary labour.   !Bie commission are in favour of an arrangement under which a forest holderwill be provided by the Commission with a small holdingon reasonable terms,  and will also be guaranteed by theCommission not less than 150 days work in the forest o&amp;ahyear.   In order that the scheme should be successful both from the small holding and the forestry points of view, itis desirable that the following, among other conditions,should be inserted in the scheme -       (i)  that not more than 5 forest holdings            shall be ereated by the Commission for            every thousand acres of forest land            acquired.31      (ii)  that not more than  800 shall be            expended on the provision of a house            and buildings for each forest holding.     (iii)  that the end seed land to be associated            with the ferest,  shall not exceed  150            in capital cost.             v36.     The Forestry CoJ^ission have discussed the wholequestion of the provision of  small holdings in association with afforestation, with the  Ministry of Agriculture andFisheries and with the Board  of Agriculture for Scotland.In the reBult, an agreed scheme has been submitted the Committoe for the details of whioh,  see Appendix.Hote,  x  She number which can be settled  in  the earlier years ofthe Porestry Scheme is neosssarily  small.   When thinningbegins the number should be  substantially  Increased.
                                                       d o a37*   The main feature of the arrangements is that in all questions relating to the acquisition of land and landsettlement, tho Forestry Commission will, In future, workin the closet oo-operation with the two Departments oon-cernedo   Small Holdings proper will eontinue, as In thepast, to be administered in England and Wales by the County,.Councils under the general supervision of tho Ministry ofAgriculture, and In Scotland by the Scottish Board ofAgriculture.   Forest Holdings, on the other hand, will be administered throughout Groat Britain by the forestry commission..   It is essential, in order to avoid dualresponsibility, that the planting in the aroa set aside forAfforestation and the provision of Forest Holdings forworkmen, should he under the apaa authority, via; thoForestry Commission.33,   The acceptance by the Government of an acceleratedafforestation programme, combined with the provision offorest holdings, will enable the Forestry Commission to makea more substantial contribution towards relieving ruralunemployment than has been possible for them since theCabinet decision of 1921.  The Commission^ activities in this direction extend to the making of roads andother works of a permanent character in their forestsand crown woods and forests, including, of course, normalfwestry operations of preparing the ground for plantingand clearing of scrub areas.   In addition to theemployment afforded directly by the Commission^ activities,there is also considerable employment provided by thescheme under whioh the Commission make grants towards theplanting of municipal and private estates.

The  Committee recommend the Cabinet:-(1)   To approve the aysteraatio  establishment     of forest holding on the  general lines     Of the  soheae set out in the AppendixZhereto,     the arrangements to include  inter alla-     (i) That not more than 5 forest  holdings         should be oreated by the Commission for         every 1,000 aores of forest  land  acquired,    fli) That not more than  800 BhouM be         expen&amp;od cm the provision of a house         and buildings for oaoh foreat holding.

In the years 192f to 1983 various programmes gf roadworks ware drawn up and put in hand with a view to providing employment.   The provisional total cost of these programmes,including the proportion to be met from the local funds, was originally estimated at  39,23C,Q08.   As a result of oloserestimates, falling costs, variations of detail and the lapse of some &quot;scheme a.,. this total ad at may now Tre put in round figures at  25,500,to which, national funds contribute  14,5007000*:.41.  When the present Government took office they found thattheir predeoeasors had recently authorise/^ a further unempjoy-ment Programme of road works estimated to ooat in the aggregate-- 11,750,000 towards whioh contributions w$re to Ve made fromRoad Fund moneys to the extent of  8,000,000.&quot;   This programme has frequently, but inaccurately, been referred to as a 14,000,000 Programme.   As a matter of fact this figure couldonly be arrived at by the inolusion of the proposed Liverpool-lancashire road, the Governments offer to contribute to whiohhad lapsed under the time limit imposed and for whioh no new financial, provision had been made by the late lovernment.42.  Thua up to the date of the present Government coming intooffloe the Unemployment road programmes totalled  37,250,000towards which the Government had offered to make grants, as and when  required  up to  22,50f,P00.43.

We understand that there are clear indications that many local authorities have no?/ as much work of this nature in hand asthey can properly perform,  or are prepared to undertake,  on the                                                       scale
soale of assistance from the 3oad Fund hitherto provided.    Insome oases they are withdrawing from,  or felling to complete,schemes which they have initiated,  on  the plea that the contributions from the Boad Fund are inadequate.47.  .      !Ehe chief advantage of the  new proposals recentlysanctioned by the Cabinet,  for the  reconstruction of sectionspf certain main trunk roads, lies in the feet that the  workwill in mfis* cases be  carried out by the Ministry of Transportunder direot contract,  wholly at the cost of the Hoad Fund: theobject  being that the. works should  be  treated apart from, and additional to,  the existing activities of highway authorities.4fi.        The  above programmes have involved pledging  theestimated balance on the Road Fund  up  to 31st  March,  1931.49.        In view of  the enormous  amount of work still outstanding  the Committee doubt the advantage of initiating anyfurther programmes at  the moment and accordingly reoommend           that work on the programme  already approved           should be pressed forward and the position           reconsidered as  soon as  substantial further           progress has been madfi-

FFORESTATIOS . &apos;     The following proposals have been agreed by the forestry commission, the Ministry of Agriculture, and Fisheries and theBoard of Agriculture for Bootland (hereafter referred to as&quot;the Ministry&quot; and&quot;the Board&quot;respectively)      (a)  In considering the suitability  of areas in England      and Wales for the Forestry Commission&apos;s purposes,  the      Commission&apos;s Acquisition Officer will keep in close      touch with Uie ministry1s Director of Land Acquisition,      and the latter officer will attend tha Commission&apos;s      Acquisition Committee in London when relative matters      come up for discussion.           In considering the suitability  of areas in Scotland.&apos;      for the. Forestry   Commission&apos;s purposes,  the Commission1s      Acquisition Officer will notify the  Board  at the earliest      possible moment (and before negotiations are completed)      of the area and boundaries of  any estate the acquisition      of which is under consideration.           A representative of the Board will attend the      Commissions Acquisition Sub-Committee in  Edinburgh when      questions affecting both departments are under discussion.      (b)   In the event of tho Forestry Commission being in a      position to acquire any property which includes a      proportion of agricultural land, it  will be necessary      for the Treasury to waive the  financial restrictions      above referred to in order that a limited  number of small      &quot;forest holdings&quot; may be established by &quot;the Forestry      Commission,      (c)   It it is found in any particular  case that in order to
  acquire  a suitable  block of  land for  a.ffore station... a iid  for  forest holdings the  Commission is compelled to acquire  an additional  area  of  agricultural land,  any  area in  England  and Wales  surplus  to the Commissions own require--  ments  will immediately be  offered through the Ministry  to the County  Council  in whose  area it is situate in  order  that they may  consider the desirability  of acquiring  it for sub-division into small  holdings.   Should the  County Council,  after  a  specified interval not  decide to  acquire  such land,  the Forestry Commission will take  steps  to dispose of  it in the  open market.      Any area  In Scotland  surplus to  the  Commission1s  own  requirements will  immediately be  offered  to the Board.  (d)    On the basis  ,of  present experience  it is  not  considered necessary that  the existing normal limit of   4 per acre for  properties purchased  by  the Forestry  Commission, or 5s*6d.  per  acre  per annum for  properties.  leased or feued  by  the Commission, need  be modified.  (e)    The forest holdings  which it is proposed should be  created  under  the above  scheme  will consist of  a cottage  and  garden with  enclosed agricultural or cultivatable  land up  to a maximum of  10 acres together with such  additional grazing  land  as might be available.   The holder  would  thus be  able  to  keen two  cows and  use the holding  for  t&apos;: e - production  of  potatoes  and other  crops  according  to the character of the  land.    The holder would be guar-  anteed by the  Commission not  less than 150 days&apos; work  in the forest, for  the most  part at fixed piece work ratesj.  these  rates enable  the men to earn more  than  the local  agricultural wage,   The forest  holding would need to be  situated advantageously  as regards the forest work and____let on 564 day tenancies^1  Both the  Forestry  Commission, the Ministry and the Board consider itlentiai in  order  to avoid  dual responsibility that the planting of thefa set aside for  afforestation and the provision of forest holdings.forJkmen should bo under  the  same authority, i,e, the Forestry Commission,
