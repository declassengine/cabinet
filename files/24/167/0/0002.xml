 (SB 13 DOCUMENT IS MB PROPERTY OF HIS HBI3MJHIC MA JESSY&apos;S GOVERNMENT).            3IB JOHN MABBIOWg MOTION ON OVERSEAS EMIGRATION.        Note by the Parliamentary Secretary, Department of Overseas      A &apos;Jyaa9:  (circulated at .the request of She Prime Minister).;  A BUMMARY of conclusions is given at the back of the memorandum).        Sir John Marriott is to move on the 28th May that             .,  &quot;Thia House  regrets that the rate of progress under the  Empire  Settlement Act,  1922,  has been disappointingly a low and urges  the Government to do  everything in their power to give  the fullest  possible effect  to  the policy embodied in that Act&quot;.   Shis will  afford an opportunity for stating our policy in respect to migra-  tion and settlement.        The Empire  Settlement Act,  which was passed in the summer  of 1922,  empowers His  Majesty&apos;s Government to spend up  to   3,000,000 a year for  15  years in all in promoting migration and  settlement by contributing to the finance either&apos; of passages,  training,  etc.,  or  of  development and settlement schemes,  but  always with  the proviso that the  British Government is  not to bear  more than half of the  expense of any scheme under the Act.    *&apos;   She first  scheme under the  Act came into operation in July  1922.    Up to the end of  March 1924 some 55,000 migrants have  been assisted to  go overseas and some  452,000 have been actually  spent.   She figures  of departures month by month naturally vary  according to the  number of steamers sailing during the  month,  etc.,  but there ia nothing  in the recent figures to suggest that there  BAA been any conspicuous  falling  off such as might be attributed  to any change of policy since the present Government came  into  power.         The results  to  date no doubt fall far below anticipations  at the time  of the  initiation of the scheme.   It IA obvious                                     W.                     that/
  that those anticipations did not give sufficient weight to  the economic difficulties of the time not only in this country  but in the Dominions.    Eor  was  sufficient allowance  made for  the time required  to bring settlement schemes  to fruition.       Shese points  are brought  out  in  the  report  made  to the  Imperial Economic  Conference by  the Committee  on Oversea  Settlement.   It is perhaps unfortunate  that the  original con-  ception of the immediate possibilities  was high,  as it has  inevitably  coloured opinion since, both as to  the value  of the  policy and as to the way in which it has been worked.         &apos;       In this country there has up to the present been no  sign  of  a  lack of persona prepared to go overseas except in the case  of  women.    She supply in fact has exceeded the numbers which the  Dominions have been prepared to take.    Progress on this  side must  necessarily depend on $he absorptive capacity of the Dominions  overseas.    It is  unquestionably at the^ &quot;Dominion-end&quot; that the  flow of migration  has been checked.      Canada for instance has  not hitherto taken full advantage  of the terms of the Empire Settlement  Act.  She has produced  only one small settlement scheme and her assisted passage schemes  are limited to (a)  nominated persons for the land;(b)  certain  classes of children- end juveniles,  (c) domestic servants.      Australia has  arranged three land Settlement schemes in the  States of Western Australia,  Victoria  and New South Wales.  She  two latter schemes  were  framed 6h exceedingly optimistic estimates  of what could be achieved.   50he  Victoria and Hew South Wales  Governments insist  that  the settler should have certain minimum  amounts of private  capital.  This requirement has proved fatal  to success.      The Western Australian scheme, where such a  requirement is  not made,  has given the  best  result.    Under this scheme there  have been  3,968 departures representing 891 families in something  under a year.   it  is understood that  further progress with the  scheme has  been temporarily suspended.                                                         At/WSttmimBSmSSii.....;.............   ............
     At the same time there  may he new prospects  opening up for Australia  on the basis of further co-operation  with  the  Common- wealth Government, to which  I refer below.       In  the debate we shall have to  mec-t criticlsta not  only  from the angle of the mover of the motion, but  also.from  those  members  of our own party who  are anxious as to  the proper  conduct  of migration and settlement,  especially in regard to  the interests of single women, children and juveniles.       My own view is that we should place in the fore front  of our policy insistence upon the supreme importance of family  migrations   The difficulties are well known.   It is necessarily  the more expensive form of settlement, especially where,  as  for instance in Western Australia,, prelijiinary &quot;development work  has to be undertaken,  during which time the wife and children  have to be housed and maintained,  but I am firmly of opinion  that we must concentrate upon its promotions       With family settlement should be associated &quot;group&quot;  settlement which does so much to counteract the sense of  strangeness  and loneliness which affects the settler in a  new landc&apos;       I have  discussed this matter with Senator Wilson,  the  Commonwealth Minister for Migration,  and find him in general* agreement with me.   Ee has placed before me a scheme which,  if brought into operation,  would eventually supersede the  existing arrangements with the Australian States,  and I made  it clear to  him that we could only co-cperate on the lines  which he adumbrated if there were a cloar understanding that  the Australian Government would meet our views on family and  &quot;group&apos; settlement as well as with regard to the arrangements  for the placing and aftercare of all classes of settlers.-,       Senator Wilson1s scheme is at present und^r the considera-  tion of the Chancellor of the Exchequer.    A separate  memorandum dealing with the scheme will be circulated.                                               Another/
     Another  matter  of  great  moment  is  the due  safeguarding of  child migration.  Our party, as I have  said,  are greatly concerned in  this matter, and it  is  also of vital  importance  to the whole policy of Empire settlement,  since  if  anything went seriously wrong under this head it might well imperil the whole movement.   There is much to  be said for child migration both from the point of view  of the  child  and of the Dominion concerned, but it is essential that we should be absolutely satisfied as to the precautions for the child&apos;s welfare.     The question primarily affects  Canada, to which Dominion owing to itB proximity to the mother country,child migration  has hitherto been mainly directed.   The Cabinet will recollect that much anxiety has recently been aroused by the suicide of two youths who  went as child migrants to Canada.  In neither case, so far as we have been able to ascertain,  did it appear that the boys had been badly treated, though in one instance the decision of the magistrates court went against the farmer con- cerned, on  a technical ground,     I have now been able to arrange, at the invitation of the Canadian Government,  that a deputation should  proceed to Canada during this summer with  a view to  obtaining first-hand information on the whole question of the supervision of migrant children and of the arrangements  generally for  their welfare. Miss MargaretBondfield has consented  to act as  Chairman of  the delegation,     I have also,  in view of these incidents,  caused a thorough enquiry to  be made by two members  of  the Oversea Settlement Committee,  into the  precautions taken by voluntary  societies etc. on this side to secure that the  suitability of children is - thoroughly  tested before they are  permitted to migrate.   Theirreport has  been wholly reassuring  on  this point,                                                        The/
     The report of the delegation which the late Governmentsent to Australia, and on which Labour was represented byMr. Wignall, M.P., will be issued on Monday the 10th instant.It deals very comprehensively with every aspect of settlementpossibilities in Australia.
                &apos;  &apos;   SUMMARY.     In dealing with Sir John Marriott&apos;s motion, I would propose to explain the causes of slow  progress, and thenwould expound our conception of policy in regard tomigration and settlement.     I would, first and foremost,.lay  stress upon theessential need for encouraging family and &quot;group&quot;migration.   Senator Wilson has authorised me to refer ingeneral terms to the discussions with him but this must ofcourse depend on the Cabinet&apos;s decision regarding the scheme.     As regards children, I would inform the House about theproposed delegation to Canada.     I would also deal generally with the salient featuresregarding other classes of migration.     I would explain to the House what has been done tocarry out the recommendations on oversea,  settlement agreedto at the Imperial Economic Conference,     Finally I would attempt to give some forecast for thefuture,  pointing out at the same time, that unless there isa sudden and unexpected economic recovery throughout theworld,  we must only expect slow progress for some time tocome.   If the&quot;&apos;&apos;matter is viewed in the right light,  this need afford no ground for premature despondency.  We fully recognise the importance of the policy of State-aidedEmpire Settlement and Development,  not from the point ofview of an immediate remedy for unemployment,  which  for manyreasons migration cannot seriously affect,  but in order togive a chance to those  of our people who wish to try a nowlife overseas, and in order to assist in the developmentof the Empire,     We mean to do our best to promote this policy on the                                                    lines/
lines which I have  sketched,  but just as it is becomingclear tha^ we cannot look for a meteoric improvement inour trade but rather for a gradual upward movement,  so, inmy view,  we cannot  expect more than a gradual increase inthe capacity of the Dominions for the absorption of settlers.     After all, as  I have said, we have the families willingto go.   It remains for the Dominions to show that they can accept families without capital and guarantee&apos; them fairconditions and a reasonable chance of success.    WILLIAM LUM.       Chairman,Oversea Settlement Committee.
