 TltfS document IS  THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVBRKMENj?9 --&quot;               .....            ...  ..                 ,      ,      ^&quot;SECRET.                  YANGSTE  RIVER        PROPOSED  BUILDING OF TWO GUNBOATS FOR PROTECTION OF                           SHIPPING,     The Foreign office in a letter of the lith April addressedthe Admiralty concerning the protection for British shipping on                       andthe Yangtse River in China/asked for assurance that theAdmiralty are satisfied that the gunboats available, when supplemented by motor boats, will as regards both number and efficiency be adequate for all reasonable needs, having regard to the probability that the present state of disorder in China will if anything growworse as time goes 011*     The letter goec on to draw serious attention to the fact thatthe general political situation in China is such that, so far as can be seen, the very important British interests will have to rely                                                        -for their protection more and more on such provision as theAdmiralty can make.   In this connection the Commander-in-Chief,China, asked for some coastal motor boats *   These small vessels are,however, entirely unsuited for the work, for, although thoy areshallow draught their engines are similar to those of aeroplanes,and they can only carry a very small machine gun.   Apart fromthe hulls being very lightly built and easily damaged, the enduranceof the engines is such that after every few days&apos; running theywould would have to be thoroughly overhauled,   In addition the crew consists of 2 or 3 men only and there are no proper quarters for their accommodation on board*     In consequence arrangements have been made to send out twomotor launches for work in the Yangtse Reaches.   These vessels are a more substantial craft than the Coastal Motor Boat and can carry a bigger gun, they have also better accommodation on board for their complement.   Unfortunately they draw over 5 ft. of water and are therefore limited to a passage of the rapids to the UpperReaches of the Yangtse at high river only, i,e. for about  twomonths in the year and it will probably be necessary to lighten
Ligliten them for this purpose.  Gunboats with a specially reduceddraught are the most suitable vessels for duty in the UpperReaches of the River.   Franco and Japan already have four moderngunboats each suitable for the Yangtso reaches, while the UnitedStates are proposing to build six.     The only satisfactory way of giving adequate protection toBritish Interests in the Upper Yangtsa above the rapids is by meansof shallow draught gunboats, which, should not only carry guns of special calibre but also have a ship1a company which is of sufficient number to be of importance.?.,   They also roquire to beable to subsist on their own resources for some period.     The Admiralty have only two gunboats suitable for theUpper Reaches of the Yangtse at present, and they are bothgetting very old (I.o. 2o years) and are under-powered for their work.   There are two other old gunboats which were specially designed for the Upper Roaches but they are now 27 years old and nearly worm out, and it is no longer safe to let them attempt topass the rapids to the higher reaches.   Apart from these, theAdmiralty have no other gunboat suitable for the work and inconsequence the only means of giving adequate protection to Britishinterests is to build at least two new gunboats.     Two replacement vessels were included in the programme for naval Construction towards the ond of last year, but they weredeleted for reasons of economy.     If the proposal to build two gunboats is now proceeded with a supplementary estimate amounting to approximately  180,000 willbe required, as there is no money available out of naval votes.The period of construction will be approximately 15 to 18 months.                                   (INITIALLED)  Clo;2nd June. 1924.
