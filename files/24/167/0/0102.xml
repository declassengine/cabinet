This docnment is  the  property of His Britannic Majeflty&apos;8 Government.SECRET.                                                           COPT No.  3 9CP.  399 (24)THE CABINET.DISPOSAL  OF SURPLUS  MUNITIONS  TO  FOREIGN                           COUNTRIES.                   MEMORANDUM BY THE WAR OFFICE.    The decision of  the Cabinet of  15th April last (Cabinet 27  (24), Conclusion 5),relative to the sale of surplus Government arms  and munitions of war to foreign States,if rigidly adhered to,  is calculated to have such serious effects on military policy that theArmy Council feel it  desirable to bring the matter again before the Cabinet, with a viewto  reconsideration.   While the previous submission to the  Cabinet  gave the general grounds for and against the sale of arms, ammunition, &amp;c, to foreign Powers, and showed the important bearing  of  such  sales on  the  maintenance in  this country of  a nucleuscapacity for the  production  of essential munitions, it did not disclose the considerablesums which might be realised by them, nor did it emphasize the importance of utilising the proceeds to replace obsolescent equipment by  more up-to-date patterns.    Apart from some 10,000 Hotchkiss machine guns  and a  number  of guns of otherdescriptions of which the sale value cannot be closely estimated, the main items whichmight be made available for disposal are represented by  800,000 rifles of early  S.M.L.E.and 1914 patterns with bayonets and scabbards  (estimated  sale  value   2,400,000),900,000,000 rounds  of  small arms ammunition ( 3,650,000), and 11,000 revolvers ofnon-service patterns ( 33,000).  These stores are not hi  every case surplus to service requirements ; for instance, some 500,000,000  rounds of the small arm ammunition areincluded  in the  approved war reserves, and if disposed  of now  would require  to  bereplaced by ammunition of post-war manufacture.  This  reserve ammunition will shortly be out of date and must in any event be replaced in the  not distant future.   Similarly,the rifles and revolvers are  largely of obsolescent  or obsolete patterns, and the sumsrealised by their sale  are required to enable the Council to provide arms of later pattern.    While the  foregoing  instances have been  quoted  as outstanding cases  in whichcomparatively large sums  of  money are involved, similar  considerations are of general application to  army reserve stocks  of  other descriptions, which by the process of  time are becoming  obsolescent or are from their nature  subject to  progressive  deterioration.In either  case their  early replacement by material of new or,  more modern  patterns is called for.    In present financial conditions it  would  be of great  assistance to the  Council, in keeping the reserves up to date, if they are permitted to  dispose  gradually of the olderpattern material,  and  to devote the proceeds, to the extent to which they will go, to  theprovision of post-war designs, as and when they are evolved.    The Cabinet decision of  15th April,  as  it stands, severely restricts not only thedisposal of purely surplus stocks but also of all Army equipment as it becomes obsolete.If this restriction  is maintained, it  will be  increasingly difficult to  keep  the forcesproperly equipped or  to do much more than work out improvements which, for want of funds, cannot  be  put into practice on an adequate scale.    Where replacement is carried out, the  whole cost will have to be incurred instead ofpart cost, entailing either  an increase on  the Army Estimates, or  the limitation of  the reserves to scales below the margin, of safety, or alternatively  the  curtailment   of other essential Army services.    The Council are  aware that some of the equipments might not realise  a great price,but in other cases it should be possible to obtain  for them quite appreciable sums, whichcould be utilised  to very great advantage.    20/J?tg/364  100  7/24  W.O.P.  1435
     Moreover, as indicated in the previous submission to the Cabinet, this country wouldreap many advantages, both military and political, if foreign  countries with whom it isallied or in friendly relations were to equip their forces with munitions of British patternorders for  the replacements  and repairs of which would have to be carried out in thiscountry, with material benefit to the employment situation.     The Council fully appreciate the Treasury objections to the  granting  of credits bythe British Government in the present state of indebtedness of many  of  the european countries  which would be likely to enter  into negotiations  for  the purchase  of  thesemunitions, and they are quite prepared to observe  any conditions  which the treasury and  the Foreign  Office may  lay  down to  govern such transactions.   They would,however, press very strongly for reconsideration of  the previous  decision and for somelatitude to be given to them to go outside the Dominions and Colonies, and they therefore ask to be authorised to take steps to find markets in suitable cases for their surplus orobsolescent equipment amongst  the  Allied  and Friendly Powers (whether directly or through private conti&apos;actors who are recognised and licensed dealers).THE WAR OFFICE,       Uth July, 1924.
