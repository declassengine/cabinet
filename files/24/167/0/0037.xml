CABINET,36/24.                                                       &apos;  f             RELATIVE RANK OF OFFICERS OF THE NAVY,                      ARMY AND A IR F ORCE,         MEMORANDUM BY THE&apos;FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTYe          On the  6th April 1921 Memorandum was circulated by  the   First  Lord of  the Admiralty to the Cabinet (C,P,2805)  pointing   out the anomalous and unsatisfactory position In  regard to   relative rank  of Officers  of the Navy,  Array and Air Force,   For the sake of convenience a copy of the Memorandum is   attached,          The Secretaries  of  State  for War and for Air being   unable to accept the  adjustments in relative rank  proposed   by the Admiraltyp the question was referred to  a Committee   consisting of  Mr, Baldwin  (then President of the Board of   Trade)  and one representative of each of the fighting  services,          The Committee  reported on the  26th October  1922,  and   it will be seen from  their report,  a  copy of which is  attached,   that it was recommended that  the table  of relative  rank should   be amended in  accordance with the  Admiralty proposals,   The   report  was considered by the  Cabinet  but  a  decision was  deferred   sine diec          Since the  question  was  first under  consideration repre-   sentations have  been  received  from Naval  Commanders-in-Chief   pointing out that  the relative &quot;rank of Naval and Air Forco&apos;   Officers  is not  laid  down  in Admiralty Regulations  and asking   for a ruling in  the matter.   Quite recently the Air Ministry   has also  drawn attention to the  omission and has pressed for   the publication  of the table of relative rank as drawn up  ,/   between the Air Ministry and War Office,
BUrnt               I would point out  to  the  Cabinet  that  the  table        of relative rank adopted  by  the  Air  Ministry  was  never        referred to the Admiralty as has always  been  customary        in matters which affect more than one  Service,  and        up to the present the Admiralty  has  not  agreed  to it *               The matter clearly cannot be  allowed to  rest        and a decision is urgently needed from the point  of view        of all three Services, I suggest, therefore, that Cabinet        authority be given to bring  into effect  the recommenda-        tions of mr Baldwin1s Committee,  or,  If the  Cabinet is        unable to arrive at an immediate decision, that the whole        question be referred to the  Lord Chancellor as  Arbitrators                                  (Intd.)

  E 0 R    T--  -     *     RELATIVE  RANK  OF  CP PIPERS   OF               THE   NAVY,   ARMY  AND  AIR  FORCE,                10 JADMIRALTY  MEMORANDUM  FOR&apos; THE  CABINET ,        The  present  position in regard, to  relative  rank of Officers  of the Navy, Array and Air  Force  is  very anomalous and unsatisfactory.   2c    This is due  to two  facts     (a)   That the  rules  as to  relative rank  between  the        Navy and the Army differ in  important respects        from the&apos; corresponding  rules In practically all        other countries :     (b)   That the Air Force in recently adopting new        titles of rank have appropriated certain  naval        titles,but have claimed to retain  a higher   &apos;        relat&amp;iro rank than  the  titles  normally carry.   3.    In practically all  foreign countries  the  following relative  rank applies as between the  Naval and Military Officers  mentioned:-     (I)   Captain Navy  ,*...*.,...............    Colonel (Army)     (S&apos;J   Commander, Capitaine de. Pre gate  ....    Lieut.  Colonel          Capltano di Fregata etc , (Navy)             (Army)   4*    This  country of course  insists that British Naval Officers  must rank  equally with Foreign Naval Officers, i,e0 the  British Captain,  REN9,  ranks strictly with  the United  States, French, or  Italian Naval Captain, and the British Commander,  R,N,, with  the United  States  Commander, the French  Capitafce do Fregate,  the Italian  Capltano di Gregata,,.  etc.   50   But  the rules as  to relative rank  as  between British Naval and Military  Officers introduce, a serious  complication, being as  below:-     (1)   Captain over 3  years  (Navy)         Colonel  (Army)    (2)   Captain under 3 years  (Navy)  .....  Lt0  Colonel (Army)    (3)   Commander  (Navy)    ,....Lieut. Col,  (Army)                                             but  junior  of that                                             rank,   6*   The British  Commander,  R.N.,  therefore ranks after the&apos; British Lieutenant  Colonel, but with  the  United SStates Com-mander who  in his turn ranks with&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos; He   United States Lieutenant Colonel,                         &apos;  7,    It follows that on any occasion when British and ForeignNaval and Military  Officers are assembled together, difficUl- ties arise owing to the want of uniformity in the rules as torelative rank,  8D   There is also constant pressure on the part  of  ForeignNaval authorities to get the relative rank of their Naval Officers raised in relation to ours, on the  ground  that their relative  rank in relation to the Army is higher,  9,   A further complication lias now been introduced by theAir Force,  The Air Force originally adopted  Military titlesiand the Colonel R.A.F, and Lieutenant-Colonel R.A.F,  necessarilyhad the&apos;same relative  rank as the Army Colonel and  Lieutenant-Colonel,
  10,  The Air Force has now substituted semi-NavalTitles, viz: Group Captain and Wing-commander,  but claims to retain the relative rank associated with the MilitaryTitles,  This would have the effect of making the Group &apos;Captain rank with a Naval Captain of over 3 yearsseniority and the Wing Commander with a Captain R,N,  of under 3 years instead of a Commander R.N,  11.  The similarity of Title and general approximationofi duties makes this differentiation in relative rankmost unfair from the point of view of the Navy,  As  soonas it becomes known abroad, It Is bound to re-open In an acute form the foreign contention that British NavalCaptains and Commanders are not entitled to rank strictlywith Foreign Naval Captains and Commanders,  12.  I suggest that the Cabinet should appoint an impartial Arbitrator, of Cabinet rank, to consider thewhole question, and that his report, if approved bythe Cabinet, should be submitted to the Kings(Intdo)   L,  of F.6.4.21
                     REPORT OPi THE COMMITTEE APPOINTED BY                                 THE CABINET, S E C R E T, C .Pc4293 o        RELATIVE RANK OF OFFICERS IS THE NAVY,, ARMY                              C  AMD AIR FORCE a                    Note by the Chancellor of the  Exchequer 3                The anxiGxed draft Report of the Committee on         Relative Rank of Officers of the Navy, Army and  Air         Force was approved by the Chairman and the Naval         Member of the Committee,           2o   The Air Force and military members discented         from the Report as they desired the naval ranks of         Captain and Lieutenant should be divided into two classes         for the purpose of determining the position of naval         officers of those ranks in relation to officers of the         Army and Air Forces           3.   It is possible that by that arrangement a more         equitable grading as between officers of the British         Army4 Navy and Air Force can be insured; but it leads         to complications and anomalies when British Naval Officers         meet foreign naval and military officers; and for that         reason it is desirable that the practice should be         discontinued 0           4.   I recommend that the rules contained in the         annexed draft Report of my Committee be approved.                                (Intd, )S,B,2, Whitehall Gardens, S0W0lo   October 26th, 1922e
COMMITTEE 01 RELATIVE RABX OF OFFICERS Bf THE          NAVY, ARMY AND AIR FORCE,TaMas of HaferenoG and composition  of  Committee.          On 5th July 1928, the prime Minister decided toappoint a Committee to consider the relative rank: ofOfficers in tha Navy, Army and Air Force.          The terms of reference given to the Committeewere as follows:-     &quot;To enquire into the question of the relative rank     of all commissioned officers of His Kajestyts     Haval, Military and Air Forces, and to report to     the Cabinet whether any, and if so, what     modifications of the existing rules as to relative     rank should ba made 5  it being distinctly under-     stood that the scope of the enquiry will not     extend to any consideration, general or particular^     of the present scales of pay of commissioned     officers of the fighting services, and that no     ra-openiag of the pay question in consequence of     any alterations in relative rank which may be made     as a result of tha enquiry can be entertained&quot;,The following were appointed Members of the Committee :-     The Rt0HonaS*Baldwin, M.P, (Chairman)     Vice Admiral Sir R.F. 3?hill.lmores       KvCB. ,E.C.McGn ,M.V.O,     Admiralty j     Lieutenant-General Sir W.E,Peyton,       EcC.B:l,EiC0ViOi ,0,8.0,,     war Office,     Air Vice Marshal 0,3wann,CoBo sCB                                  Air Ministry0Lieut-Colonel Sir J.E.
