[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty^ Government.]              Printed for the Cabinet.  June 1924.SECRET.CP.  354  (24).                                            39                              CABINET.  SPECIAL   REPORT    ON    UNEMPLOYMENT.          No.  105.   Period ended May 26,  1924.    THE unemployment figures given in Part I (A) of this report show a decreasefor this period of 32,154 or 3-1 per cent, of the total number of unemployed personsregistered on the 28th April.    The improvement  in  employment was steadily maintained throughout  theperiod to which this  report  relates,  the&apos; reductions in  the number  of  personsunemployed in each of the four weeks being respectively  7,120, 14,522, 5,106 and5,406.  To some extent this resulted from seasonal causes,  but it will be seen fromPart II of the report that the industries of shipbuilding and engineering contributedtowards the general improvement.

A decline in employment  has  occurred in this industry, due to the seasonal decrease in home consumption and to a falling off in export trade.   In the North-Eastern Collieries  the depression  has chiefly been felt in Durham  and Northumberland, particularly in the coal-exporting centres.   Employment in the South Yorkshire  collieries, however, has  continued to be  satisfactory.  In  the Lancashire area there has been a falling off in orders and consequently less work, but the decrease in trade is only regarded as temporary.   In the Midlands, employment has remained normal in  North and South  Staffordshire, but a slight falling  off in demand  is now beginning to be felt in other centres.   Short-time working  has commenced at Chesterfield, where 8,000 men  are  working four days  per week.   In the South-Western counties the Bristol  pits are fairly busy, but work is slacker in the Somerset coal-fields.   The position in the  Forest of Dean area is not at all satis- factory,  largely due to bad export trade, but also to the decreased home demand. Unemployment and short-time working have resulted.  In Wales and Monmouthshire the position has become worse owing to a reduction in demand, which  in turn caused a shortage of wagons. Approximately 22,000 men have been involved by the stoppage of  collieries in this area,  hut in some cases these collieries are now working  inter- mittently, or have resumed full-time&apos; working.    The problem of securing  suitable employment for men in the more advanced age groups, particularly unskilled men, is becoming increasingly difficult.  In Scotland there has been a falling  off in  demand from home and foreign markets.  Short-time is being worked  at Airdrie and Ayr. At the latter place difficulty is being experienced owing to the lack of wagons.     Stone Quarries. Employment generally  remains  good in  this industry.     China Clay. There is no change to report in this industry.  The Cornish pits are still very busy, but there is still a considerable surplus of labourers.     Iron Mines. There  is  no change  of importance  to record  in  this industry. Unemployment continued to be heavy in the  Cleveland district and in Cumberland.    Tin  Mines. A further slight improvement has occurred in Cornwall. IRON AND  STEEL  PRODUCTION.    The  position in this  industry has  not improved, although certain  individual centres showed signs of improvement.   In the North-Eastern Counties no appreciable change has taken place except at Middlesbrough, where suspensions of men  have occurred..  A special feature in this area is the import of 100 tons of  pig iron  from India for making up into railway chairs and reshipment to India.  Foundries in Sheffield  are understood to have more  work in hand than was  the case a year ago, and firms engaged in the manufacture of steel sheets are maintaining their  rate of production.  Makers of manganese steel points  and crossings are actively engaged on increased orders received from Home and Colonial Corporations.  Manufacturers of railway material are still busy.  In the North-Western Counties, full time is being worked at Workington, and the iron furnaces are in full blast.   Employment has also improved in the steel furnaces.   At Barrow the Haematite Steel Company anticipate reopening their works during the next few weeks.  In the Midlands area unemploy-ment is still heavy and the position is  unstable.   A firm of ironfounders  at  Tiptonhas closed down,  and 200 men have&apos;  been  discharged.    Trade is  very  poorat West Bromwich and Cradley Heath, but there has been improvement at BrierleyHill and  Stourbridge.   In the central  Midlands area the position has improvedslightly.  In the Welsh area there is a slight falling off in activity, but the positionremains fairly satisfactory.  In Scotland the  demand continues to be limited, but any improvement  is dependent upon  activity  in the shipbuilding industry.  It  isreported  from Motherwell that exceptionally large  quantities of foreign partly-      [11728]                             &apos;                         B 2
finished steel have been imported, which is having an adverse effect upon the puddlingsection of the tube works.TIN-PLATE TRADE.    Continued activity is still being experienced in Wales and there is no falling offin trade.  In the South-Western Counties at Lydney and Bristol, firms are still busy.SHIPBUILDING AND SHIP-REPAIRING.    There is a steady though  slight improvement to record in this  industry, and reports from all districts show that work is now proceeding more regularly.  In theNorth-Eastern Counties orders  for new  vessels have been placed at Middlesbrough,South wick,  Stockton, Thornaby  and West  Hartlepool.   In  the North-western counties also there has been a definite  improvement, particularly at Barrow.  Inthe Merseyside area repair work still continues to provide employment for increasing numbers.  The position in the London area is still bad,  but a slight improvement inthe South-Eastern Counties is apparent,  especially  at Gravesend and Chatham.Increased activity is  also being experienced at  Yarmouth  and Lowestoft,  due topreparation for the fishing season.  In  the South-Western Counties ship repairershave been busy at Southampton and Woolston finishing up arrears of work following the strike.   At Avonmouth the repair yards are somewhat slacker, but at  bristol and Cowes a steady improvement has been made.   There  was little or no improvementin  Wales  except at  Swansea,  where increased employment was  available.   AtScotland several  contracts have  been finished which  have accounted for a  few .discharges, but these are neutralised by the  fact that new orders are coming in orin contemplation.   At Dundee only  three out of ten  slips are empty, and it isanticipated that these berths will  be commissioned in the near future.  New orders have been received at Clydebank,  Port Glasgow, Dumfries and  burnt island.  Not-withstanding these indications  of improvement,  unemployment  in this  industry onthe Clyde continues to be heavy, and the prospects of revival are not encouraging.ENGINEERING.    Motor and Cycle Engineering.-The employment position in this branch of theindustry continues to  be good.   In the North-Western Counties  the general activity has been maintained, except at  Trafford Park, where discharges by the  Ford motor company have taken place, alleged to  be due to the falling off of orders.    In the Midlands area trade  is still good and the  general  improvement main-tained, although the  outlook  is uncertain.   There has been  a slight setback atCoventry, due to discharges by the Morris Motors, Limited  (350 men), and by theTriumph Cycle Company.    At Birmingham  the motor-cycle  trade  is good, and orders are  still on hand.The motor-car trade also remains good,  with the exception of the Calthorpe motor company, who have discharged  500 men, and are  in process of voluntary liquidation.Trade is good at Derby/and  has improved at Redditch, where overtime is beingworked by  the Enfield Cycle Company.    At Northfield (Birmingham) the Austin Motor Company, Limited, continue to bebusy on small cars, and workers are being  taken  back at Tipton by Messrs. Harper,Sons and Bean.  The Raleigh  Cycle  Company  at Nottingham  are still very busy,and contemplate extending their premises  at an early date.     In the South-Eastern Counties  the position has  scarcely  changed.   Activitycontinued in the manufacture of commercial motor vehicles, but in the case of lightmotor-cars the position is uncertain and discharges have taken place.   On the otherhand,  a firm at Southall  have notified  vacancies for fitters,  builders,  turners  andpainters used to light-car work.     In the South-Western Counties the tendency is in the direction of improvement.300 workers mainly semi-skilled or unskilled out of the 4,000 hands employed bythe Morris works at Oxford have been discharged, and  an auxiliary firm who makeradiators for the Morris cars have placed 200 of their employees  on short-time.   TheDouglas motor-cycle works at Bristol  are still working  at high  pressure.  At Poolework on motor-body building  is still busy,  and  at  Swindon motor  firms are fully employed.   Seasonal activity on repair work is evident.     General Engineering, This branch of the industry continues to show improve-ment.   In  the Sheffield area structural firms are understood to be  very  busy,  and dropped stamped tools are in  more demand, whilst  files continue to be required in increasing quantities.  Twist drill makers are moderately busy,  and saw makers are quite fully employed.
    In  the  North-Western Counties  there&apos; has  been a  gradual  improvement.Textile machinery manufacture appears to be the least affected by this improvement.    In the Midlands there is little change to report, and  unemployment remainsheavy.  Employment in the Electrical Engineering trade at Coventry remains good.    In the South-Eastern Counties improvement has been maintained, and work onmarine engines, agricultural implements and printing machinery  continues to be good.  Work, however, is still slack at East London, Bedford and Ipswich.    In the South-Western Counties there has been a continuous steady recovery,especially  in ironfounding and agricultural machinery.   Agricultural engineeringat Banbiiry shows improvement, and the railway shops at Eastleigh  and Swindonare very busy.  At Bristol and Newbury work is slack.  There has been no improve-ment at Portsmouth,  and the Stroud Valley  is only moderately busy.   In Scotlandan improvement has taken place at Dundee,  due to the shipbuilding activity.TEXTILES.    Cotton. The position in this industry showed  little.change,  increased employ-ment at some centres being balanced by decline at others.  Employment has been well maintained in the manufacture of high-grade goods, but in  the American cottonspinning section, and in the manufacture of cheaper cloths for  the Indian and chinese  markets, curtailment of production continued.  Short-time in the finishingsection of this industry tends to increase.  In most branches of the industry there isstill an appreciable amount of under-employment, and in several  cases four days aweek are being worked, whilst in other cases operatives are employed on only two orthree looms instead of the normal complement of four looms per weaver.    Woollens and Worsteds. The position in this industry is fairly good, but is somewhat uncertain.  There has been a sudden depression in the wool-combing sectionat Bradford.  Other woollen textile districts in Yorkshire, however, show a slightimprovement.  The piece-goods trade continues to improve, especially in the home market.  Far Eastern business is on the  slack side,  but there is a distinct improve-ment in  the general position.  Steady improvement  is reported from Scotland.    Hosiery. The position remains good in most  districts,  but  in the underwearsections  short-time is still  being  worked.   At Ilkeston, Rugby and Ruddington(Notts) improvement has been maintained, but work is slack  at Sutton-in-Ashfieldand Derby.  A similar situation obtains  in Scotland.    Lace. In the Midlands area there is a considerable amount  of unemployment,and trade is very depressed at Basford, but there has been a slight improvement inthe curtain section.  At  Beeston,  in the curtain sectionj there has been a  temporaryslump, but trade is better in the  plain net section.   The leavers&apos; section continuesvery slack. Improved trade is reported  from Long Eaton and Ilkeston.  Improvedemployment is also reported from Barnstaple and Torrington.    Silk. The position  generally is very satisfactory, and the dyeing departments at Leek are busier. The artificial silk industry at Derby is still busy.  Trade continuesgood at Coventry^and Longton.    Jute. There is no change to report.  At Dundee a shortage of weavers is stillresponsible for the unemployment of other workers in the main, but a further causeis the anticipated fall in the price of jute, causing employers to postpone buyingraw material until the present production is worked off.    Carpets. General improvement  is maintained in this  industry,  and  there is continued  prosperity at  Kidderminster.   The  factories  at  Stroud, Salisbury andSwindon are still working whole-time.BUILDING AND  BRICK AND  TILE MANUFACTURE.    The position in this industry is very satisfactory, and a high level of  activity ismaintained.  In the North-Eastern counties work is continued at high pressure, andthere is  a  proposed extension in housing schemes by colliery companies at Barnsleyand Moxborough.   In the  North-Western area the  work is brisk, but is  restrictedsomewhat  by the scarcity of skilled workers, all efficient bricklayers, joiners, masonsand plasterers being employed.  Seasonal activity is  keeping painters and decoratorsfully employed.    In the Midlands area employment is good in all sections, and  there is increasedemployment amongst painters. In most areas there is a shortage of skilled workmen
 and an increasing demand for plasterers.  In the South-Eastern counties the demand for bricklayers and joiners exceeds the supply, though the demand for plasterers has slackened somewhat.  A firm of paper manufacturers at Sittingbourne contemplate building 750 houses to accommodate their workpeople.     In the South-Western counties work is steady, and there is a shortage of skilled workers.  At Gloucester the Corporation Housing Scheme  is in full swing.  At Portsmouth the shortage of bricks has now been met, and work is busy.     In Wales and  Scotland  there is increased activity, and the shortage of skilled labour in these areas is also felt.     In the brick and tile trade employment is generally good, and the demand for Fletton  building bricks at  Wellingborough  is  greater  than the  output.   At Hanley full pressure of work is maintained, and a local firm contemplate enlarging their plant.     In the South-Western area trade  is brisk at Bridgwater and Bristol. CLOTHING.     The  general seasonal improvement is maintained, especially in the tailoring and dressmaking  trades.     In the corset trade some slight improvement has been made at Ipswich, but there is still considerable  unemployment.  Trade in this industry is good at Kettering and also at Leicester; short-time is being worked at Derby.     In thei shirt and collar trade work is better at Taunton.  In the glove trade work is in full swing at Barnstaple, Yeovil  and Torrington. BOOT AND SHOE.   - There has been an  improvement in most areas in this industry, except in  the Midlands.  At Leicester there  has been a rush of orders  for Whitsuntide1, but a slackening-off after  this period  is expected.    Full-time is maintained  at Mansfield, Bromsgrove and Northampton factories, and there is a slight improvement at Kettering, Wellingborough and  Rushden.  At Derby and Coalville short-time  is being  worked.   Trade is  very poor  at Raunds,Wollaston and Wolverhampton.    In the South-Eastern  counties there  is little change to report.    Trade isgenerally busy, but there is a fair amount of surplus labour.  At Norwich the industryis in a satisfactory condition, and 9,000 operatives are employed, which is  almostequal to the pre-war figure.    In the South-Western counties there has been a rapid improvement, which is,however,  considered to be only temporary.  The Bristol firms generally  are slack.  AtKingswood there has been a sudden rush of work to make up depleted  stocks after heavy consignments  to Ireland, prior to the imposition of an import duty by the FreeState Government.POTTERY.    Employment is  still below normal, but there is a slight improvement.  All areasin the South-Western counties are still busy, and little unemployment prevails.    In the Midlands at Hanley increased activity is manifest in the better class ofchina and earthenware.   Conditions generally are better at Longton, Burslem andNewcastle-under-Lyme.TRANSPORT.    Little improvement  has taken place, except of a seasonal nature.    In the North-Eastern counties there has been an increase of employment amongmerchant seamen at Blyth,  North Shields and  Sunderland.  At Boston the  BostonDeep Sea Fishing and Ice Company, Limited, are leaving the port, and the majorityof fishermen in this  area will have to seek work at other ports.    In the North-Western counties unemployment is very heavy at the docks; this is largely due to the poor state of the cotton industry.    In the South-Eastern counties work at the docks continues to be steady.    In the South-Western area work at the docks is rather quiet. There  is improvedemployment among seamen, which suggests an early increase of activity at the docks.At Bristol and Avonmouth there has been a slight depression due to the slackening ofthe timber trade.  Weymouth is already benefiting by the opening of the channel islands season.  In the Welsh area conditions are good, and employment has improvedat Newport, Barry and Swansea, while the position at Cardiff is better.
                     III. OVERSEAS  SETTLEMENT.                              (Colonial  Office.)    tinder the Empire Settlement Act, 1922, assisted passage schemes for Australia,New Zealand, Canada and Ontario have been agreed with the Dominion authorities concerned.   In addition, schemes for the settlement of immigrants on the land havebeen agreed with the Governments of New South  Wales, Victoria and  Western Australia.   A number of organisations, having  as  their object the provision  of facilities for the  settlement of immigrants in certain  of the Dominions, have  alsobeen assisted.   An extension of  this assistance  to  other  organisations is underconsideration.    The number of persons approved for assistance and the number of  departuresduring the month of April  (with  the corresponding  figure  for  April of the  lastfinancial year) and for the whole period up to date  are set  out in the followingTable:-&apos;MONTHLY  Progress  Return  relating to Schemes approved  under  &quot; The Empire                            Settlement Act, 1922.&quot;Approval and Departure Figures.Dominion.

With regard to the latter, the methods of financial co-operation are so  diverse that it is impracticable to give an aggregated figure of ExchequerAssistance.  For this reason, the accompanying Summary is only indicative of theextent to which the Exchequer is involved, and must be regarded as supplementary to,  and  not  in substitution of,  the  detailed information  given  in  the  Tablesthemselves.
