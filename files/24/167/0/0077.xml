[This Document is the Property  of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]                      Printed for the Cabinet.     July 1924.SECRET.CP.  374(24).                       The Amritsar  Disturbances.                      0&apos;Dwyer-Sankaran Nair Libel Action.    Following on the discussion of my previous Memorandum, CP. 351 (24), by theCabinet on the 18th June, the Prime Minister replied in these terms to Mr. Lansbury&apos;request, on the 23rd June, for the grant of time to. discuss a motion dealing withMr. Justice McCardies remarks : &quot; I have come  to the  conclusion, that a discussion on this subject would only add to the harm that has been done in India by the wordscomplained  of.   However  unfortunate  the words  have been,  they clearly do not constitute the kind  of fault, amounting to a moral delinquency, which constitutionallyjustifies an Address  as  proposed.  It ought  in  fairness to be borne in mind.thatthe objectionable passage occurred, not in a considered written judgment, but in an oral charge to a jury delivered at the conclusion of a lengthened and somewhatheated trial,  and the very form  in which it  was couched shows that  the learnedJudge  was not  informed  as to what  took place.  As  I have already  stated, HisMajesty&apos;? Government completely associates itself with the  decision of  the Govern-ment (not merely the Secretary of  State) of the day.  Eis Majesty&apos;s Government will always uphold the right  of  the judiciary  to pass judgment, even on  the Executive, ifit thinks fit, but, that being the right of the judiciary, it is all the more necessarythat it should guard itself  against  pronouncements upon issues  involving gravepolitical consequences which are not themselves being tried.&quot;    The position of His  Majesty&apos;s Government with regard  to Mr. Justice McCardie&apos;scomments has thus been made plain to Parliament.   It appears to me to be  desirableto reaffirm that position  in  the  form  of executive instructions  to the  authoritiesin India, in  order to remove any possibility of doubt, based  on inferences fromMr. Justice McCarclie&apos;s statements, as to the principles which must be held to govern the use of force to suppress civil disorder.    1  circulate accordingly the  draft,  in which the  Prime  Minister concurs,  of a despatch  to the Government of India which  I  propose, subject to the concurrence ofmy colleagues and my  Council,  to issue next week.  1 ask that the draft may betaken as approved  if no dissents reach me by Tuesday, the 8th July.   I also propose,if the despatch issues, to arrange in consultation with the  Government  of India for it to he -published after its receipt in India.                                                                   OLIVIER.    3rd July 1924.    Draft Despatch to His Excellency the Right Honourable the Governor-General                              of India in Council.    1 have no doubt that Your  Exceliency&apos;s Government have  read the  reportscontained  in the public Press of the trial of the action 0&apos;Dwyer v. Nair, and haveobserved the  remarks made  by the Judge, particularly  on the 2nd May and the5th May, and in his summing-up to the jury on the 4th and 5th June, regarding the actions of General Dyer at Amritsar  in April 1919.  Mr. Justice McCardie expressed his view that General Dyer acted rightly, and that he was wrongly punished by theSecretary of State for India;    This  expression  of opinion  upon a point for a judgment upon which all the materials were not available  to  the Court, and in a  case  in which  the Secretary ofState, who was criticised and condemned, was not a party, has been dealt with by thePrime  Minister in  the House of  Commons in answers of which I enclose copies for your information, and His Majesty&apos;s Government do not propose to  comment further on it in its more personal aspect.    But it has  a wider  aspect  and  raises a  general  question of grave public importance.  For Mr. Justice McCardie&apos;s  deliberate  condemnation of the  action ofHis Majesty&apos;s  former Government,  together with the remarks which fell  from His     7464    100  7.24                                                  \l
Lordship-at  earlier stages- of the trial,-might lead to the inference that  one of HisMajesty&apos;s Judges  holds views regarding  the  use of force, when military action isinvoked,  in  support of  civil  authority, which are at variance with those which havehitherto  been accepted by His Majesty&apos;s  Government and upon which the existino-orders on the subject are  based.  Whether  or not  this inference is correct HisMajesty&apos;s Government are not aware  and  are not  concerned  to enquire.  But it is their duty to make their own attitude  plain, and in  order that there may be no doubt in the minds of Your Excellency&apos;s  Government, your civil and  military officers, andthe public at large, they desire to reaffirm  in their own behalf the principle laid downby their  predecessors in Mr. Montagu&apos;s despatch No. 108  (Public) of 26th May 1920in the following terms : &quot; The principle which has consistently governed the policyof His Majesty&apos;s Government in directing the methods  to be employed when military action  iu support of  the  civil authority is required, may be broadly  stated as theuse  of  the minimum force necessary. His Majesty&apos;s Government  are  determined that this&apos;principle  shall remain the primary factor of policy whenever circumstancesunfortunately necessitate the suppression of civil disorder by military force within theBritish Empire.&quot;            &quot;&apos;  &quot;&quot;     They therefore dissociate therhselves from the view that the action proper to betaken by a  military or police !offi6er&apos;  for dispersing an unlawful  assembly may bedetermined  by a consideration of the  moral effect it  may be thought likely by theofficer taking it to have on&apos; other &quot;persons  whom he may believe to&apos; be contemplatingdisorder elsewhere.   1    &quot;  &apos;     &apos;  &apos; &apos;  &quot;               &apos;     They also&apos; adhere  to  the&quot; views&apos;  of their &apos;p]jede6essors, expressed in the  samedespatch, from which Mr. Justice McOardie would appear to  have been  disposed todissent, as! to the principles which should  govern the use of aeroplanes to avert civildisturbance.         &quot;&apos;     I, attach to this despatch, for your information, a transcript of the Judge&apos;s charge to the jury.
