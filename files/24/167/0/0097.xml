DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT). RET.594 (24)t                                                          HQ                         CABINET.            RELATIONS BETWEEN THE NAVY AND THE AIR FORCE,                    NOTE BY THE LORD CHANCELLOR.   1.   At a meeting of the Cabinet held on March 12th, 1924, I   was requested, aB Chairman of the Committee of Imperial Defence,   &quot;to Inquire Into the interpretation of any doubtful  points in the   report of the Sub-Committee (consisting cf  the  Earl  of  Balfour,   Viscount Peel and Lord Weir)  of the Committee of  Imperial Defence   on tho  Relations of  the Navy  and the Air Foroe.   (Cabinet 19 (24) Conclusion 4,  12th March,  1924).   2,   I  accordingly convened several meetings  of the  representatives   of the  two Services  involved, as a result  of  which it was found   possible to arrive at  what appeared a  favourable  basis  of agreement   between the two parties to the  dispute.     I  therefore   invited   Air Chief Marshal Sir  H.M. Trenchard,  Bart.,  G.C.B., and Vice-   Admiral Sir R.J.D. Keyes,  Bart., K.C.B., to discuss  the  outstanding   details together and to furnish a joia&amp; report  on the subject.   3.   This report has now been completed and shows that agreement   has been reached on  all outstanding points of difference, with   the exception of that  concerned with the incidence of oost of the   Fleet Air Arm as between the  two Departments.   This matter   has been referred to the Treasury for  decision.   4.   Though no doubt amendments to the arrangements  now  proposed   will be required from  time &quot;to time in  the  light of practioal                                                       /experience
experience, yet it Is hoped that the main principles willprovide a lasting and satisfactory settlement of the questionswhich have been at Issue between tho Admiralty and the AirMinistry.5.   The Report itself is of a very technioal nature, and Ido not think It Is necessary for my colleagues to burden them-selvea with a detailed examination of its provisions,6.   I should like to place on record my appreciation of thevery helpful  spirit in which Air Chief Marshal Sir HughTrenohard and Vlce-Admiral Sir Roger Keyes have approachedthis      difficult end controversial question.   The goodwillwhich they have displayed provides the best possible auguayyfor the successful development of the Fleet Air Arm.7,   I suggest therefore that r-           (a)  The Cabinet should take note of the faot                that machinery has been created by mutual                agreement of the parties concerned, whereby                the recommendations of the Committee on the                relations of the Navy and Air Force, can be put                into operation.           (b)  The Report of the representatives of the                Admiralty and the Air Ministry should be                brought to the notice, end filed In the                archives, of the Committee of Imperial                Defence.                               (Intd.) H. of C.2, Whitehall! Gardens, S.tf.1.        July 11th, 1024.
