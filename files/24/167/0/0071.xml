[&quot;This Document is the Property of His Britannic Ma)esty&apos;s Government, jPrinted for the Cabinet.   July 1924,SECRET.Copy No.C.P. 368 (24).CABINET.THE  CHANNEL TUNNEL-1920.MEMORANDUM  BY MR. BALFOUR.(Reprint of Committee of Imperial Defence Paper No. 96-4.)    THE problem of the Channel Tunnel has come up in a new shape and undernew conditions.  Undoubtedly the results arrived at by previous enquiries must be revised.  Whether they should be reversed  or not is  a different question.   On thewhole,  after considerable hesitations and some vacillation of opinion, I am inclined to think that the old decision should be upheld.    My reasons are the following :          ,    It  is of the first importance that the country should be  secure from invasion; itis almost as important that if  it is secure, it should think  itself so.  For only thuscan we avoid the perpetual agitation and the recurrent alarms which are inevitableif our existence as a nation is in doubt.    Before the Defence Committee came into existence some twenty years ago therewas no pretence of agreement between the Army and the Navy on this subject. TheNavy always declared that it could protect us from serious  invasion; but the Armyuever  even pretended  to believe them.  Discussions in  the Defence Committeebetween the heads of the two Services and the statesmen of the day effected at least the appearance of agreement.   The Army conceded that while we retained command of the  sea invasion on a conquering scale was impossible;  the Navy, for its part,conceded that  it could not guarantee our shores against a  raid; each side perhapsmaking its concession with some slight mental reservations.    It  was in this state of  affairs that repeated decisions  against the ChannelTunnel were arrived at after long discussions and duly recorded.    Since then what has occurred to change our views ?    1.  Our alliance  with France has made us feel that anything which  would facilitate the rapid transfer of British troops to French soil  is in  the interests ofboth countries. This argument,  as far as it goes, is, I think, a good one;  though1 must observe that  there is some doubt  whether a Channel Tunnel would alwayssecure the object aimed at.  Its very existence would destroy an immense proportionof the cross-Channel steamers on which we had so largely to rely during the war inorder&apos; to  maintain our communications with France.   Once destroyed, they  wouldbe extremely difficult to replace,  and we should have no temptation  to replace them so long as the Channel Tunnel was in good working order. But if, either by accidentor design, through the blunder of an official or deliberate sabotage, the tunnel was put out of  action, our means of communicating&quot; with the Continent would be worse than they have ever been within living memory. If such a calamity occurred at somecritical moment in the fortunes of a British army engaged  in a continental war theeffects would be disastrous.    2.  Railway  communication  with France would  make  the blockade of thiscountry by raiders and submarines far more difficult than it is. This, I think, maybe admitted; but  I fear that we must not exaggerate the advantage we should thussecure.  It we were fighting for our lives against a strong naval Power and france were a neutral, the advantage of the railway, from the supply point of view, would,I doubt not, be very considerable.  But this is a somewhat  improbable contingency;[11774]
and if France were either&quot; our friend of bur enemy,&apos; the advantage would be almostnegligible.  This is quite obvious if France were  our enemy; but it would also be true if France were our ally, for in that case she would herself be a large importerof food,  of raw materials,  and of munitions.   Her railways would be choked withmoving troops, and her rolling-stock would be required for her own purposes.  &quot;Weshould get nothing.    3. Some of the  precautions for rendering the railway  useless for.purposes of invasion,  which were suggested-before the war, and which were  even then thoughtinadequate,  are  now  impossible.  The viaduct  connecting  the tunnel with theinterior,  which was to be so arranged as to be vulnerable to gun-fire from the sea,might, under existing circumstances, be more useful to the enemy than to ourselves.They could bombard it from submarines as well as we; and I have already explainedhow perilous it would be to have our communications through the  tunnel interruptedat a time when the railway might be the main line  of communication between our home bases and our forces at the front.    4. The  possibility  of  a  raid has always  been  admitted;  and  it would be unreasonable to assert that if a raid is possible elsewhere along our coasts, it couldnot be effected where that coast approaches most nearly to shores  held by an enemy.No doubt it would be within our power to station sufficient forces in the  neighbour-hood of Dover  to repel any raid which was lucky enough to elude our Navy.   Butthis would involve, I suppose, the construction of  new barracks and the  permanentlocking-up, in peace as in war, of a considerable body of regular troops.  This wouldbe expensive,  and from a  purely military point  of view extremely inconvenient.Nor would it be made  more attractive by the  fact that modern artillery can easilykeep Dover&apos; under fire from the French shore,  can make the harbour useless, and the barracks  untenable.    5. I do not dwell upon the risks which are inseparable from the most cunninglydevised schemes for denying, at the right moment, the use of the tunnel to an enemy.All such schemes may be defeated by some  accident happening to a complicatedmachine, or a nervous official losing his head.  I do not say that such a contingencyis likely;  I  only say that  it is remotely possible :  and this,  for my argument, is sufficient. On the other hand, what  is not only possible, but relatively easy, wouldbe the destruction of the tunnel by sabotage, at a moment when military  operationsbased upon its use were being carried out on  the other side of the Channel.    6. The  dangers I have adverted to  are known,  and in a  certain sense arecalculable, but I am even more afraid of the dangers which are not known and whichare not calculable.  All that has happened in the last five years in the way of militaryand naval development submarines,  aircraft,  and long-range  guns has  tendedwithout exception to render the  Channel Tunnel a more  dangerous experiment.These have all made it more difficult for us to be sure that it will be open when we want it to be open, and closed when we want it to be closed.    And  have  we the least  ground  for thinking that  the  process  is going to be reversed ? And if it is not, if after the economic and  sound habits of the world haveadjusted  themselves to this new  mode of access to the  Continent  we find that it isfatal  to  our  safety,  what  are we going to  do ?  Destroy the tunnel in times ofprofound  peace?  Impossible.   Wait  till its  dangers  have been  proved by a disastrous war 1  Still more impossible.  The riddle will be insoluble.    It-may of course be said that  the unknown dangers which I fear, may possibly be of a kind which will put an end to our position as an island Power, and make the command of the sea useless  as a means of defence.  It may be so;  but let us wait tillit is so,  and so long as the ocean remains our friend do  not let us deliberatelydestroy its power to help us.
