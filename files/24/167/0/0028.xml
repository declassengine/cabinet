In the following remarks on the Hours of industrial employment Bill I have the concurrence of the Secretaries ofState for War and Air who share on the one hand my generalsympathy with the principles of the Bill and on the other handmy apprehensions as to the danger to the efficient administrationof the Fighting Services of certain provisions in the  Bill.     I regard it as imperative that the Head of a service department should have full power to authorise working overtimeboth in Government Establishments and in contractors  Workswithout having recourse to the cumbrous procedure provided in theBill which would be liable to hamper us very seriously on occasionsof real urgency*.     The draft Convention leaves each country free to  adoptthe administrative machinery most convenient to it,.and, inmy opinion, the purposes of the Bill would be equally  safeguardedand risk of serious inconvenience and delay in work of greatImportance would be avoided if the: several Departments concerned were each made responsible for carrying out the overtimeclauses in respect of their own employees and contract work.   Thiswould be no new principlej we are already responsible  in this way.for instance, for giving effect to tho Fair Wages Resolution.     I would accordingly urge that It should be provided in clause S that in respect of employment in Government Establishmentsor of employment on work   . that is being carried out  by contract for Government. Departments, the regulations in the section may be                                                      made e....- J.
made by the Ministers responsible to Parliament for theseveral Departments concerned in placo of the Minister of Labour     Tho clause should also provide that so far as the service departments are concerned;, they should not necessarily followagreements made between outside organisations, that, where necessary in the interests of the State, regulations may be made without consultation with such organisations or with therepresentatives of the workpeople, and that in obtainingagreement to variations of hours or overtime the service departments should be abla to deal, if necessary7direct withaccredited representatives of their own workpeople *     There are two further points of minor importance in whichamendments seem to me to be required in the Bills   Firstly, Ithink it is clear that it was not intended that the convention should be regarded as covering persons employed in connectionwith industrial undertakings but not engaged wholly or mainly on manual work, such as clerical classes in industrial establishments, messengers, gatomen, caretakers and warderso  i suggest that the wording of the Bill should be looked atcarefully to make certain that people of this kind have notbeen swept into itc     A ruling is required regarding tho application of the Billto establishments such as Storehouses (Ordnance Depots)  and to individuals such as Foremen and Assistant Foremeno     Secondly, the exemption in clause 7 dealing withemployment at soa or on inland waterways has been so draftedthat it does not cover men employed in tugs or dredging craft,and it is important from our point&quot; of view that these classesshould be exempted equally with those employed in the transportof passengers or goods by soa or inland waterwayso  So far as I i see, this is not contrary either to the letter or tho spirit ofwhat has boon agreed internationallyotoMlfiAlTY.  30bh May* 1924e(INITIALLED)    CV
