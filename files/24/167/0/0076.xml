Memorandum             by the        Minister of Transport.     1.     Before tho War the charging powers of transport undertakings were regulated by means of statutorymaximum charges which were set out in the Aot or Orderauthorising the undertaking or by subsequent amendingActs or Orders,   The Increased costs of labour and materials, &quot;brought &quot;about by the War made these maximainadequate, and to meet the difficulties which thenarose, the Minister of Transport was given temporary powersto modify the permanent statutory maximum charges afterreference to Advisory Committees.          These temporary powers were sanctioned by thefollowing Acts         x Statutory Undertakings (Temporary Increase of              Charges) Act, 1918,           Ministry of Transport Act, 1919.         x Tramways (Temporary Increase of Charges) Act, 1920.         x Harbours; Docks and Piers (Temporary Increase of               Charges) Act, 1920.         x Harbours, Docks and Piers (Temporary Increase of              Charges) Aot, 1922,           Canals (Continuance of Charging Powers) Aot, 1922,               x  Continued from time to time by the                    Expiring Laws (ConJ-inuanoe) Aots.
    2.   In the case of Railways, provision has been madeby the Railways Act, 1921, under which the Railway rates tribunal was appointed and givon powers both to fix thestendard charges and to revise them periodically, with thenecessary transitory powers until standard charges are fixed.    3.   In the case of other transport undertakings thetemporary provisions remain.   As things stand at presentthey will end ac regards Harbours, Docks, Piers and Canalson 15th February, 1925, and as regards Tramways on 31atDecember, 1924.   Directly they coase, the undertakings will automatically return to their pre-war statutory maximumcharges, unless freBh legislation is enacted.   The pre-warstatutory maxima may continue to be inadequate, and consequent-ly some of tho larger undertakings have introduced PrivateBills to obtain higher charging powers.   While the largerundertakings, more particularly the larger docks and harbours,are in e position, if necessary, to bear the expense of aprivate bill, there are many smaller undertakings to which such expense would be prohibitive.     4.   Associations representative of the canal andTramway Undertakings approached the Ministry last year witha request thatythe Government should promote legislation tomake the present temporary arrangements permanent.          It may ultimately be considered desirable tointroduce permanent legislation, but ponding further considera-tion of the matter, the late Government authorised the Ministryof Transport to announce that it was the intention of theGovernment to include the temporary Acts, to which reference is made above, in the Expiring Laws (continuance) Acts of 1924and 1925 so as to relieve the undertakings in question of thenecessity of incurring the expense of promoting Private Bills.
099ci &apos;J hThe Associations representing the various transport undertakingsconcerned were notified accordingly,  and tho necessary steps have been taken to Include the temporary Acts in the expiring laws (Continuance) Bill of this Session.   I am now advleed,however,  that the Canals (Continuance of Charging Powers)  Act,1922, has been so drafted that its operation beyond the 15thFebruary, 1925, cannot be secured by including it in the expiring Laws (Continuance) Bill and that the only way to overcome this technical difficulty is to introduce duringthe current Session a one clause Bill amending the Act inquestion so as to make it operative until the 15th February,1926, thus redeeming the pledge given to the Canal Association.Such a Bill has been so drafted that  it would be possible  forfurther extensions of time, if necessary, to be dealt with infuture Expiring La*&apos;S EillB and it would, I think, be non-controversial in view of the notoriously weak financialposition of most canal undertakings.       Possible&apos; opposition might come from traders who mayapprehend that canal charges would be maintained at an unduly                                                               ihigh level, but it ia unlikely that they will raise this point,as it is open to them, under the existing Act, at any time toask the Minister to refer the existing charges to the RatesAdvisory Committee constituted under Section 21 of the Ministryof Transport Act, 1919, before whom they can state their case,a procedure which is preferable to opposition before a parliamentary Committee.       The main safeguard against unduly high charges on the canals is, however, the competition whioh they sustain fromrailways, road vehicles and other transport agencies.   5.    In the circumstances, I recommend that I should have authority to introduce on an early date a one clause Bill  (adraft of which is attached)  to extend the operation of the
Canals (Continuance of Charging Powers) Act, 1922,one year from 15th February,  1925.                                  (Initialled)  H.03rd July. 1924.or
