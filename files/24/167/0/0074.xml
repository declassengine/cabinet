MS   (CUSTOMS)  BILL, 1924,     Memorandum &quot;by the financial  Secretary  to the Treasury.          This iB an Annual Bill, confirming the resolutions of  the  Manx legislature.          The Isle of Man has a  separate financial existence,  levying its own taxes and defraying its  own expenditure, and  in particular  it is completely free as to Customs and Excise  Duties subject to confirmation by the Imperial Parliament,  While  the Resolutions of Tynwald (the local Parliament) require  confirmation by the Imperial Parliament, it would be unprecedented  for us to alter them.           Resolutions in the Court of Tyhwald have effect for six  months from the date of the Resolutions, and if Parliament is  then in session until the end  of the then current session but  unless the Resolutions are confirmed by  an Act, they cease to  have statutory force at the end of that  time.   The Resolutions  confirmed by this Bill were passed on the 27th May.           The effect cf the Resolutions confirmed by this Bill  is as  follows:-           Tobacco.   The Insular duties remain the same as the  Imperial duties.           Beer.      The Insular import duty remains at  3. 4. 0.,  as compared with the Excise duty of  3.15.0. (average) in this  c ountry.           Spirits.   The Insular duty on  spirits remains at   3. 7. 6. a gallon, as compared with  3.12.11. in this country.           Cocoa.     Reductions are made  in the rates of the                                                            Insular

There is no  Resolution providing.for the continuance ofthe Insular ad valorem duties oh Clocksj  Watches, and certainhusical Instruments,    The duties on these articles will thereforelapse on the 1st August hext concurrently with the correspondingImperial duties.         Tea, Coffee  and Cliicory Duties  in the Isle&apos; of Kan are so small as to he not worth considering.         There are no Insular duties on Sugar and Sugar Cognates,,         Cinematograph Films, Dried ffrtiits,  Hatches, Motor Cars         and Cycles.                  Hpte on,,the &quot;Common Purse&quot; Arrangement^.        In cases where the Isle of Man Customs duties differ fromthose in force in the United Kingdom; the proceeds are paid direct to the Insular Exchequer,        :-;/here the duties are the same, the &quot;Common Purse&quot;arrangement is in operation:  the whole duty is paid into theImperial -Exchequer, and the Island is subsequently credited withthe amount of duty payable on its estimated consumption of such articles, calculated by multiplying the resident population plusan artificial &quot;fiscal equivalent&quot; for visitors by the averageconsumption per head in the United Kingdom.   The true &quot;fiscalpopulation&quot; is ascertained at intervals of 10 years by obtainingreturns of the actual imports to the Island of the articles inquestion, and dividing the total duty value of such imports bythe total duty value of the consumption per head of similar articles in the United Kingdom for the same yearB.  The &quot;fiscal equivalent&quot;for visitors in that&quot;.year is then obtained by deducting the residentpopulation from the ascertained  &quot;fiscal population&quot; and is variedin subsequent years in proportion to the annual increase or decreasein the number of visitors.
