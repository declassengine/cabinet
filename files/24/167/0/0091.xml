I DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT.                                                           % secret                                                      W  / &quot;388&apos; (24)                                                     1                               CABINET        PROPOSED INQUIRY INTO INDUSTRY AND TRADE.       Note by the president of the Board of Trade.     I ciroulate herewith to my colleagues a Memorandumby the Secretary for Mines about the representation ofthe ooal export trade on the proposed Committee to inquire into Industry and Trade.     This matter will be before the Cabinet to-morrow.                                 (Intld.) S.W.Board of Trade,  8th July, 1924.
                                                          ISO             Memorandum by the Secretary for Mines.     I have just seen your memorandum to the Cabinet of the4th July  (O.P.377/24) about the proposed inquiry &quot;into theconditions and proapeots of British Industry and Commerce, withspeolal reference to the export trado&quot;.  In it you say &quot;We (i.e.yourself, the Lord Privy Seal and Home Secretary) doubted thenecessity of Including any representative of the coal export trade&apos;!     For reasons that I have already oommunioated to you I feel bound to record an emphatio protest against this decision. In theexport trade of thi3 country, with which this Comnittee isparticularly to concern itself, coal, directly and indirectly, isof unique importanoe.  How oan the omission to put someone onthe Committee who has some knowledge of the country!s. primaryindustry  possibly be defended?  I understood your argument to bethat the  Committee was not to be representative  of particular industries but was to take evidence from all.  But I must havemisunderstood you, for I see that in your own memorandum youspeak of  &quot;adding an additional representative for iron and steel&quot;,and of asking another man &quot;to represent eleotrioal Industries&quot;.And indeed it is obvious that practically every  man on your listwill regard himself, and will be regarded by everyone else, as&quot;representing&quot; a particular industry.  It seem a  to me that ourposition  will be Indefensible if we include Banking, Shipowning,Cotton Spinning, Engineering, Railways, Textiles, Iron and steel and eleotrioal Industries, and omit the industry on which allthese, and indeed the whole industrial prosperity of this countrydepend.   I am oonvinoed that if this is done there will at&quot;once be such an outory from the coal industry that the Governmentwill bo forced to do under pressure what it would be muoh better to do now voluntarily.     I hope that you will lay this protest before the Cabinet.                               (Sgd.) 15. Shinwell.                                        8th July, 1924.
