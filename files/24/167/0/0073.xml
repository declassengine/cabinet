Commissioners for. the purpose of financing the bodies authorised by Parliament fco lend money for Local Loans.    The capital required is provided by the issue of Ufa Local Loans Stock,          The main purpose of the annual Bill is to fix.the maximum amount which may be issued by the national Debt Commissioners to the lending bodies .   Last year&apos;s Act authorised the issue of  80,000,000 to the  Public Works Loan Commissioners,          It is no* necessary to  renew this authority to enable advances to.be continued and it is essential to pass the Bill before the House rises.   Clause I. of the present Bill authorises the issue of 525,000,000 to the Public r*orks Loan Commissioners,  which sum it is anticipated will be sufficient to meet requirements for about another 12 months when the next Bill will in the ordinary course,.be taken.         -The  25,000,000 includes the provision which is considered adequate by the Ministry of Health for the purposes of the new &apos;Housing Bill and also  provision for advances under the- Agricultural Credits Act,  1923,  and for the purposes of the Public Health Acts.

Clause II. accordingly authorises the write off  ofthe annual instalment of principal of a loan of  10,000 grantedto the 3yemouth Harbour Trustees.          In some cases it is necessary not only to write  offbad debts from the assets of the Fund but further to remitthe debt (which remains due to the Hxchequer) as against the borrower, and this course has been necessary for several years in the case of the Hyemouth Loan (Clause III.), the circumstancesof which are fully explained in the preamble to the clause.          The Bill is not likely to give rise to any controversy in the Hous e.TREASURY.  S.W
