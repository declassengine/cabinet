                Engineering - General Trade.     Colonel Armstrong  said that the situation in general engineering was not quite so good.  Enquiries had fallenoff somewhat, and orders were not coming forward as well as before.  There had been a check in the upward tendency.He had received reports that the Japanese, after issuinginquiries in this country, had placed a good many ordersabroad, in Germany and  elsewhere, for a cheaper class ofgoods.     Speaking from the point of view of the Federationof British industries, he said that the general feeling wasone of somewhat diminished confidence.  Perhaps this was due to some extent to ,the renewed fall in the Frenchexchange.     Sir Arthur Balfour said that the situation in Sheffieldwas not quit9 as good as when he last reported:  the rateof absorption of unemployed had fallen off somewhat.  Tradein general was very patchy?  orders were small and buyersshowed a disposition to hesitate.  The Japanese trade was almost at a standstill, partly on account of the rush of importation when the tariff was taken off:  there had alsobeen a good deal of speculation both here and In the UnitedStates which had had an adverse effect upon the exchange.Orders from India were good,  but those from South america had fallen off.  Trade in engineering tools was not as good as it had been a month ago.     Referring to the subject of Chinese trade marks,  sir arthur said that in his own oase a Chinaman had registeredone of his marks:   he was proposing to pursue the matter,but in the meantime, he had felt compelled to register all his other marks under the Chinese law.   Traders generallywere new doing the same.
                       QONFIPEHTIAL.                Eleotrioal Engineering.                                  ....     MrA Hugo Hirst wrote; -     &quot;The conditions of the Electrical Industry are prettymuch the same as they were last month.  In the South ofEngland activity is rather less: in oertain Northern Areas,particularly Sheffield, we seem to notice an improvingtendenoy.     &quot;Heavy Engineering during the last month has been rather lifeless, business having been scarce and whatthere was, was obtained at poor prices.     &quot;I regret that also in Export we notice no improvement&quot;.                   Iron and Steel.     Sir Glynn lest wrote:-     &quot;With regard to the heavy steel industry, theconditions in this trade have not improved, in fact it maytruly be said that the conditions are getting graduallyworse.  Sinoe the last meeting, two or three steel works have entirely shut down, and this has been due to the steady fall in the value of heavy steel work.  The bulk of the big steel works are still oarrying  on and selling their products at a trading  loss, hoping for better times in thofuture.     &quot;It Is interesting to note that the import figuresfor iron and steel, mainly semi-finished material from france, were in April, 198,900 tons, as compared with165,200 tons in March&quot;.     Mr. Arthur Dorman said that he had never knownprospects in the heavy iron and steel trade to be asgloomy  as they were at the present  time.  The industry had 1felt the effect of continental competition for seme years past,  continental manufacturers generally being able to
CONFIDENTIAL.215                  Iron and Steal   pntd. ),.undercut it to the extent of  1 or  2 per ton on bars andbillets.  His own firm had been compelled to close down arolling mill during tho last month, thereby putting some S00hands out of employment.     There had been a slight improvement in shipbuilding, andplate mills were doing a little better.  The chief trouble was the lack of export business, which normally amounted tosome 66$ of the total.  India had been taking smallerquantitiess there was also a- great lack of orders for steelrailsj we now export only some 200,000 tons of these perannum, as against about 1,000,000 tons normally.  during his recent visit to South Africa he had found that railsproduced by Krupps were being laid, purchased at some 35/-a ton below British prices.  He anticipated that it would now be necessary to revert..to the pre-war position in theiron and steel trade of this country, which had been too much extended during tho war:  This meant that a number ofworks would have to close down indefinitely, and only the better equipped would survive.  There was probably an excessof iron and steel production throughout the world,  british manufacturers were in addition hampered by high charges for railway rates, op&amp;l and wages, especially the two former.The situation as regards sheets, tin plates and wire was not so bad, but there was a heavy slump in angles, girders,billets and other heavy iron and steel products.     Mr. Baker said that the tonnage output of pig iron andcastings for April was lower than for March or for april last year, but this was perhaps due to some extent to the factthat.the Easter Holidays had been extended this year owing to
                    Iron and Steel, (oontd.).trade conditions.  There seemed no reason to think that the &apos;figure for May would show any further drop.  Works at Barrowand Consett, were still idle, and Messrs. Dorman Long had found it necessary to close down one of their rolling mills,with the result that 800 men were thrown idle.  The lastascertainment of smelters&apos; wages under the Bliding scalehad given an advance of 1^- per cont., which indicated some-what harder prices:  the Midland Wages Board had given a2-1 per cent, advance.  The improvement which was reported as showing itself in shipbuilding had not yet affected theiron and steel trades.  The depressed tendency was perhapsdue in part to the renewed depreciation of the franc.     Mr. Beaumont Pease said he had heard through his Bank&apos;sreports that there was a fairly brisk enquiry for pig Iron.Mr. Baker replied that the reports which MB Union receivedfrom Scotland were to the effect that the pig iron situation was very bad there.   It was true that the plant in theScottish work was to a oertain extent out of date.     Be noted efforts on the part of iron and steel makersIn India (which had not so far been successful), to establishmarkets in America.  Firms in China had,  however,  suoceededin this.  Attempts were also being made to work local oresin Borneo.  These indications pointed to  the probability ofa dimunition in the effective market for  British iron andsteel goods in the future.     Mr. Lindsay,  asked for his views upon this question,  saidthat before making any forecast,  he would wish to  see what happened to the Iron and Steel Protection Bill which was now before the Indian Legislative Assembly; he thought that  itwould pass into law.  It was true that there were  someopponents of the measure in the Assembly,  who were actuatedsolely by the interests of consumers.                          -4- &apos;
CONFIDENTIAL.                     Textiles - Cotton.     Mr. Holroyd.-said that the improvement in theootton trade whioh he had reported a month ago hadnot been maintained: demand had fallen off considerablyduring the last two or three weeks.  This, for thefirst time, was true of the Egyptian Section of thetrade as well as the American Section.   So far as theAmerican Seotion was concerned, the principal reasonfor the decline probably lay in the difference betweenquotations for spot or near-month cotton as oomppredwith futures for the new crop.   The price now teingquoted for forward cotton for October was 15.60d.per lb., i.ec, about S-g-d. a lb, oheaper than forimmediate delivery.  This had caused Far Easternbuyers to hold off, and the tendenoy would probablyoontinue until more was known about the prospects ofthe new orop.     He also thought that the dyeing position was not without its effect upon the general situation of thetrade, since it was found that British yarns could besent to Germany to be dyed and brought back to thisoountry at a oost including incidental expenses lessthan if the dyeing were done here.   It was, true thata certain amount of yarns had always been sent abroad to be dyed in the past.-   The President remarked thatthis situation wa3 being oarefully watched by the Boardof Trade, but that statistics did not seem to showany increase in this development.
CONFIDENTIAL.              Textiles - Cotton (Contd.)                       i     With regard to the prospeots of the new cotton crop, Mr0 Holroyd said that the first report of theUnited States Agricultural Bureau on the subject had just been received, and was a discouraging one.   Theorop was baokward, though this would be remedied ifthere were suitable weather during the next two orthree months  As, however, the Bureau&apos;s reports arenot always to be relied on implicitly, the british trade were sendipg out investigators of their own, and hoped to receive their report during the next month or six weeks.     Sir Edwin &quot;Stockton wrote:-     &quot;There is  very little change in the tradeposition as regards Cotton Piece Goods sinoe the last meeting at the beginning of May.  The important markets of the world still show a desire to buy, but arerestricted in their operations owing to the high valuesruling here at present; caused very largely by theshortage of the Raw Material.  I am afraid we cannothope for any substantial improvement until the winter months, when by that time we shall.have better indioa-tions of what the  prospeots are of the next CottonOrop, and the present discount on future months will of oourse have then materialized.&quot;
                        TEXTILES - WOOL    Mr.Andrews wrote:- &quot;Raw Material, During the  last month.prices have had a slight tendency to droop, and is probably theresult of the financial pressure customary at this time of theyear, owing to the financing of large imports from the Colonies.    &quot;Combing. The X Bred Section is fairly well employed, but theMerino Section is still only very badly employed.  Probably thewhole of the woolcombing section is working to about 15% capacity.    &quot;Spinning. Spinners are fairly well employed, more especiallyin the X Bred Section.  Nearly the whole of the Machinery is working, because the demand for Hosiery is still  fairly good.Exporters of Yarn to Germany aro still finding it extremelydifficult to obtain payment for the heavy exports of the last3 months, and thero will probably be a considerable curtailment of exports to that country during the next few months, onaccount of the purchasers in Germany being unable to obtainsufficient sterling to make their payments.    &quot;French Exohange. At the moment the competition from Franceis not so keen as it was in the early part of the year fororders placed in the British Home Market, on account of the in-stability of the French Exchange.    &quot;Australian Exohange. The Importing Season being now over,the wool trade is not much interested in the Australian Exchange,but unless something is done, the difficulty of obtainingCredits will be very great during the next buying season.  as this is purely an Australian domestic matter, I cannot see how the British Government can interfere, or do any real good.  in calculating expenses, if we pay dearly for the Exchange, weinclude this in the expenses, and the wool grower receivesless remuneration than he otherwise would if the  Exchangewere at par - therefore, the loss is thrown back  upon thegrower  of  the wool.
                         CONFIDENTIAL,.                                                                (.1 v                    Textiles   Wool (Contd,)     &quot;Wages Agreement. The Wage Agreement in the Wool TextileTrade expired on Hay 31st, and has not been renewed. The workersolaim a 10$ rise on the basic rate, whioh, with the cost of livingadded, means a 17$ advance on present wages, and this the employers are quite unable to concede.  I do not think, however that theIndustrial Counoil are incapable of arriving at a settlement. TheEmployers have made the offer of oontinuing last years agreement,and beyond this they do not seem disposed to make any concession.&quot;                      Textiles - Worsted.     Mr. Sutoliffe Smith wrote:-  &quot;There is no general improvementin the trade since I last reported, and the number of peopledrawing benefits in Bradford from the State UnemploymentInsurance has slightly increased since last month.     &quot;The looms are still running about the same percentage, say60$ but the spindles are not quite so well employed as a month ago owing to the check  to the export yarn trade to Germany.     &quot;The politioal situation in China is hampering our businessthere, as it prevents traders in the interior from carrying ontheir business and they are not inclined to act except with thegreatest oaution.  In the Treaty Ports stocks are reduced almostto a minimum, but the present high replacement costs of goodsrestricts buying to bare  necessities.  This also applies toIndia although there has been a fair amount of miscellaneousenquiry for textile goods from that country.  As stocks are very low, it is anticipated that there will be a good demand later onshould the monsoon be favourable.     &quot;There ha3 been a fair demand for certain goods for theUnited States and also for the Continent, but buyers for SouthAmerioa, Egypt, and the Near East continue to give out ordersvery sparingly.     &quot;The weather has been against the Home Trade, but with moresettled weather there should undoubtedly be a revived demand.&quot;
                     BOOTS x,MD SHOES     Mr. Poulton said that the home trade in boots andshoes had shown some improvement, but probably this wasonly due to a temporary demand for Whltsun goods.  Theexport market was badly situated, and did not seem likelyto improve.     He had been asked to bring three specific points tothe Board1s notice.  The first related to the new tariff on boots and shoes in the Irish Free State, the operationof this had been advanced by one week from the datepreviously announced, with the result that many thousandpairs of boots and shoes which had been intended forexport to the Free State were lying up in this country.He asked whether&apos;the Department could aive any assistancein coming to an   arrangement with the Free StateGovernment in regard to this,     The second point related to a growing tendency tosend goods to this country from abroad put up in Eritishcartons and sold as British goods.  This was a serious matter for the boot.and shoe trade, and here again he asked that the matter should receive the Board!s attention.     The third matter was one of special gravity from thepoint of*view of the British industry, namely, thePure Leather Bill which was before the South AfricanParliament.  The effect of this measure would be practically to rule out all British leather goods, since it set up impossible standards.  Adulteration of goodswas not in question.   The result of the measure, if it became law, would be that, while.the best portions cutfrom a bend of leather would be admitted, the importationof other cuts from the same bend would be prohibited.He had been asked on behalf of the manufacturers, whoserepresentative was unable to be present,  to bring this                        -9-
                     CONFIDENTIAL                  222                    BOOTS JIND SHOES (Contd. )matter to the Government^ notice, with a view to theirtaking any possible action to assist the trade.                      CHEMICALS.     Mr. Perry said that there was no change in thevolume of trade in chemicals: the index figure forsulphuric acid remained the same as last month.Considerable anxiety was felt as to the proposed Anglo-German Dyestuffs agreement, about which there was as yet no definite information:&apos; he hoped that some pronouncementmight be made shortly.   A second point over which theindustry was much exercised was the problem of the disposalof the large quantities of sulphuric acid which would, beproduced as a by-product of the new zinc smelting industryin this country.   Attempts which had been made by those concerned to come to ah agreement with the fertilising andsulphuric acid trades in this country had not so far been successful.   The consequent possibility of the market for sulphuric acid in this country being flooded wastherefore causing anxiety:  it was already very wellsupplied, producing power being much in excess of cOKsumption.      There had been no change in the condition of export markets,  fin the two factors of uncertainty to whichhe had referred were removed, there was no greatincentive to develop overseas trade.     Referring to the proposed Dyestuffs /^re-inforcement, thePresident said that the Government was fully alive tothe importance and urgency of this question, and would takeho  - steps without consultation with the chemical industry itself; they would also keep in view other interests which were likely to be affected, such asthose of the textile trades.
W hJ jjj                 FOOD INDUSTRIES - GENERAL TRADE.     Mr. Machln said that his general impression, in contrast to the view expressed by some other speakers, was that therewas now more confidence generally and that trade conditions were somewhat better.   He spoke more particularly for the produce markets and the food industries.   In the case ofthese, the home demand was better and the tendency towardsImprovement seemed likely to continue.   Touching on thequestion of retail prices which had been referred to at thelast meeting, he said he was inclined to endorse the viewsthen expressed;  there appeared to be an excessive disparity between manufacturers&apos; and wholesalers1 prices on the one hand,and those which the public was called on to pay on the other.     Generally speaking, the food Industries found a marked improvement in their foreign markets, especially South africa and parts of South America;  but the position in Europe was rendered difficult by exchange fluctuations, and he fearedthis state of affairs was likely to continue.   The situationall round, however, was better than it was a few weeks ago.                           SHIPPING.     Sir*Alan Anderson said that freights were slightly down:the Chamber of Shipping Index figure for April stood at 31per cent of the average 1920 level, as compared with 32 percent for March.   Tonnage laid up during the quarter endedApril amounted to 410,000 tons, as against 630,000 duringthe quarter ended January.   With regard to the prices ofnew tonnage, a figure of  8 per ton was now quoted for a newready steamer of the general tramp class, aa compared with 8.15 in January, 1923:  this figure was very low.   He thought                         - -11-           &apos;l!
                                                      991                                                      &amp; u a                         SHIPPING. (Contd.)however, that the surplus of general tramp tonnage waa beinggradually absorbed.   The case was different with specialsteamers:  here owners felt that they ought to get in their orders before prices rise - as they had already begun to do to some small extent, though builders were still under thenecessity of cutting their profits.     He referred to the International Shipping Conference whichhe had mentioned at the previous meeting.   Fourteen nationswere represented there:  the United States representatives,who had originally attended only in the capacity of observers,afterwards became delegates.   One of them had informed SirAlan that American shipowners objected to the proposed pre-ferential railway rates in the United States:  whether thiswas really the case seemed rather uncertain, but undoubtedly the Chambers of Commerce in the United States did not favour the proposal.   The Conference had succeeded in reaching commonviews on most of the questions before it, though a certainamount of criticism of Great Britain was expressed - generally to the effect that we had gone ahead too fast over certain new proposals, more especially the Hague Rules.   The Scandinaviansparticularly objected to the application of the Hague Rules to full cargoes, and Sir Alan said that he personally was inclined to share this view.     Foreign representatives also had a complaint on the  subjectof the British Government^ action in regard to wireless,  wherethey said we had applied more onerous rules than those laid downIn the International Convention.   General opinion was to theeffect that the time was now ripe for a revision of the life-saving and wireless rules.   There was also a feeling amongowners and seamen that the deck cargo rules should be altered:
                       RAILWAYS.        Mr. Brooke said that railway carryings of merchandise had been good in March, and passenger traffic had also been exceptional on account of the      vstrikes, but receipts were still down,  receipts formerchandise being Q% and those for passenger traffic9% below the corresponding period of last year.                   SHIPPING.  (contd..)in this last particular he thought that the existingScandinavian Rules were better than our own.        The Conference had received a letter fromM. Albert Thomas, stating that the InternationalLabour Office was concerned, from the point of viewof seamen&apos;s interests, in questions which theConference had under discussion.   The feeling ofthe Conference was that the results of theirdeliberations should be communicated to the InternationalLabour Office, but that some delimitation anddefinition of that body&apos;s functions were needed.
                                                        9 feet                      CONFIDENTIAL                        l- 0                 CO-OFERAilVE  SOCIETIES.     Mr.Gallacher said that the situation of the ScottishCo-operative - Societies had not shown much change since lastmonth.  There  was a slight improvement in furniture: the grocerybusiness was steady with&apos;a tendency towards improvement:clothing factories were also slightly better situated than amonth previously.     With regard to the effect of the budget reductions on teaand sugar prices, he observed that the sale of sugar had not increased to any appreciable extent, and the price had gonedown, apart from, and in addition to the budget reduction.On the other hand, there had been an increased demand for tea,where the duty had previously been a fairly heavy one.     The Scottish Co-operative Societies were giving serious consideration to the question of retail prices, and he hadbeen asked to address meetings all over the country on thesubject.   He thought there was a disposition on the part ofthe public to welcome the advent of %e system of fixed prices at all stages.   The Grocers1 Association had now taken thismatter up.  If the idea found favour generally the result would be that the public would pay the same prices everywhere.He thought that profits would probably be stabilized inconsequence on a more reasonable level.  The system wouldalso protect the manufacturers and wholesalers, and he hoped,might lead to some advantage to the consumer.      The President observed that there seemed to be some risk that, while this arrangement might prevent undue profits insome  cases, in others it might amount t,0 an agreement to keep up prices. Mr.Gallacher replied that the system had probably been  originated owing t0 the fact that certain manufacturersfound their goods were being, sold at unremuneratively low prices: the fixed minimum price, however, tended to become an absolute price, which in practice was not exceeded. It wouldbe to the manufacturer&apos;s interest to see that retailer1?&apos;profit margins were not excessive.                                -14-
                         BANKING.     Mr. Tennant said that the hanking situation showedlittle change as compared with the previous month.  Advancesand deposits remained practically stationary.     Mr, Beaumont : Pease said, with regard to the hankingsituation, that there had been little change in monetary-conditions.  The fluctuation of the foreign exchanges wasone of the chief factors at present to he reckoned with,and the depreciation of the franc was reflected in an appreciation of the dollar.  The dollar exchange was lower than it had been for two months past, and this fact, takeain conjunction with the large amount of loan issues abroad,was causing some anxiety for the future.  The possibilityof a German loan was still looming in the distance.     With regard to the Australian exchange position, hehad observed notices in the Press that a Bill wag being introduced by the Commonwealth Government to remedy thepresent difficulties.  He understood that, as a result of conferences between the bankers and the Commonwealth PrimeMinister and Treasury, the opposition of the Notes Board tofurther issues of currency had been to some extent overcome.     Sir William MacBeath i said that, though it was uncertainwhat method exactly would be followed, he did not think itwould be by way of an increased issue by the Notes Board,The necessary steps would, he thought, be taken by theGovernment through the Commonwealth Bank, in the form ofGovernment loans to the&apos; banks,                   BANKING - GENERAL TRADE.     Mr. Baring said that financial business had been quietduring the past month.  Over most of the world, it seemed,  &apos;the policy of buying from hand to mouth, prevailed,, and though this policy, by preventing, any accumulation of stocks,  might

Among commodities, rubber and sugar had attractedattention by the decline in their prices.  There ma pressure on the part of Central Europe to place contracts for the  saleof the coming beet-sugar crop,.  which, if the weather turnedour favourably, might be large.  Anxious eyes would also  be turned on the weather, during the next few months, withreference to the coming American cotton crop,  in fact it looked as if the weather, In the Northern Hemisphere, wouldbe an unusually important factor this year.     In Germany there was an acute shortage of money; bothexporters and importers  were offering fancy prices for theuse of dollar or sterling creditso  With regard to someproducts, of which she was in normal, times a free taker,such as oil nuts and West African produce, Germany was nowreduced ^o a meagre ration, and in many respects the financial...condition of that country was viewed with anxiety.  Amongmerchants of finished goods and yarn in this country, forinstance, it was natural, that there should be someapprehension with regard to the ability of Germany to carryout contracts for the purchase of goods made before the markwas stabilizedt,  Some raw cotton had indeed been re-shipped,he believed from Hamburg and Bremen owing to payment not beingforthcomings  But on the whole it looked as if the recently-enacted banking measures would prove effective and enable the trading community to meet their contracts.

BANKING - GENERAL TRADE  (Contd).     America wa3 undoubtedly suffering from a temporarydepression, the effect of which was being felt throughoutthe commercial world0  The great textile industries of theNorthern States, for instance, were unremunerative - raw woolhad even been re-shipped, in some quantity, from Boston to europe - and in spite of the fact that the world&apos;s outputof gold was being poured, as fast as ships could carry it,into the lap of America, merchants in that country were notfree buyers of commodities, and the American publio showed a marked disinclination  to invest money outside their own country.  No one could blame them for that, but the fact was unfortunate for Europe.  The dollar exchange had moved downabout 10 cents during the month of May, which meant a deterioration of about     in our currency,  This wasdisappointing, since this was the time of year when weusually looked for steadiness or  strength in the rate, andit was to be ascribed, he supposed, to the fact that Americain general was an unwilling buter, while in addition therehad been going on a certain amount of investment in dollars byFrenchmen and other people who were dissatisfied with theirown currency,  These fluctuations in sterling and francscaused uneasiness and impaired the confidence of merchants and traders.  On the other hand encouragement was to be derived      vfrom the definite progress which certain European btates had achieved in setting their finances in order.  Turkey and russia,  unfortunately, were both still looked upon asobstacles to progress.  &apos;                     AUSTRALIAN TRADE.     Sir William Mo3eath  said that the general condition of australian trade continued very good.  There had been goodrains, and the wool crop would be larger than last year.He referred to the progress made in the cultivation ofcotton:  62,000 acres in Australia were now under cotton ascompared with 30,000 last year.
                       CONFIDENTIAL.                     : ^             AUSTRALIAN TRADE (Continued).     There had been some contraction of trade during thepast two months on account of the  shortage of currency.The Notes Board had refused to increase the Notes Issue.He had, however, been  in touch with the Prime Minister of theCommonwealth, and had pointed out  that traders in thiscountry were anxious for some steps to be taken to relieve the situation.  Mr. Bruce had now  cabled  that the government proposals are to be embodied in a  Bill to be introducedalmost immediately.  This should be of assistance for thenext wool season.  It was proposed to adopt some features of the Canadian System, though he  was not able to give any definite details yet,,  At present  the banks in Australiawere unable to meet, their customers1 demands which werewarranted by the expansion of trade  He felt sure, however,that the wool trade in this country would be satisfied withthe Commonwealth Government^ proposals when they became known.                      INDIAN TRADE.     Mr. Lindsay  said that April  had shown a reduction Inthe favourable balance of India1s  trade  This had increased during January, February and March successivelyfrom  6,000,000 to  9,000,000 and  12,000,000.  April on theother hand had shown a notable reduction,  resulting 3n aslight Adverse balancec  This was principally due to alarge purchase of sterling for the purpose of payments tothis country on Government account, which was included inthe trade figures.     There had been a slight reduction in the proportion ofIndian imports from the United Kingdom.   These had previously averaged 60 per cento  but had fallen to 57 percent, for the year ended 31st March,  1924,.     Otherwise the import trade continued  steady,  and,
                                                           29 4                                                             O i                           CONFIDENTIAL,                      INDIAN TRADE (Continued) .owing to the absence of stocks in India, probablyrepresented the country&apos;s absolute hand-to-mouth requirements,and was therefore not likely to fall off.     The India Government was making efforts  to extend and improve the cultivation of cotton.  There had been anincrease of 50% in the acreage under cotton as compared withthe season before, and legislative action was also beingtaken to improve the quality of the crop.  It was proposedhowever, in the Lee Commission^ report that  theagricultural service should pass entirely into the hands ofthe provincial legislatures, and it was impossible to say what the effect would be upon these projects.
