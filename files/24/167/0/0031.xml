J7[This Document is the Property, of gig Britannic Majes-ty^s Government).Memorandum hy the Chancellor of the Exchequer.     1.   Everyone -would be glad to see a sugar beetindustry prospering in this country on an ordinary commercial.basis and it must be admitted that the recentreduction in the sugar duties haa the 6ffect ofdecreasing the profits of sugar beet cultivation.     But,when all this is granted, it by no means follows thatthis Government should adopt the policy of directlysubsidising an industry.    This would mean taking a step ofsuch seriousness and such far-reaching consequences as torood air overwhelmingly good case for its Justification.     2.    I do not for my part consider that such a casecan bo mado out for the sugar beet industry.    At thepresent moment it enjoys two exceptional advantages -3 3 0 B E I.C4BIEEI,0,  P.  330(24).3UGAR(a)
(a) Home grown sugar carried no excise duty, unlike all other products which are subject to a Customs duty.

Even with reduced sugar duty, this means protection to the extent of £11.16.0 a ton (l1s. 8d. per cwt.).      (b) At the present time and as far as one can see for some time in the future, sugar producers throughout the  world have considerable difficulty in keeping up with the demand.  No one is dumping sugar and the market is willing to take every ounce it can get. None of the usual arguments for protection are therefore applicable.

(c) Further, I understand that owing to the length of the root, sugar boet is a particularly useful crop to the farmer for loosening the soil. The Minister of Agriculture himself admits that the root crops at present grown  in ordinary rotation are unremunerative. It follows therefore that farmers in their own interests should welcome sugar best growing even if that crop yields then a very small profit.

These points would certainly not escape the notice of the British sugar refiners who are mostly free traders and who would greatly  resent a further and direct subsidy to home-grown sugar; and would also be used as a lever by  Empire sugar producers, e.g. the West Indies, for demanding equivalent protection for their products.

3. Apart from these general considerations I an by no means convinces that with skilful management the industry cannot be conducted a profitably without a Subsidy.

The
The Trade Facilities Committee recently granted an application for a guarantee of £90,000 to the Anglo-Scottish Beet Sugar Corporation. This Corporation produced  - figures which tell a very different story from that told to the Board of Agriculture when the growers are seeking a subsidy. On the assumption that the  price of sugar is as low as £23 a ton and that the duty is about £12.10.0 a ton, the Corporation expects to make a profit of  £11.7.0 per ton, or at the rate of something over 30%. Even if the import duty were as low as £6.5.0 (instead of the present rate of £11.16.0) they expect to make a profit of nearly £7 a ton on a selling price of £29.5.0. These figures do not strengthen the case for a subsidy.

4. The Minister of Agriculture&apos;s plan contemplates the gradual withdrawal of the subsidy at various stages. It requires no exceptional powers as a prophet, with the McKenna duties fresh in our minds, to be certain of a tremendous outcry from the vested interest which ex hypothosi will have been created when it is proposed to put into effect the reductions in subsidy at the end of the fourth and seventh years. Incidentally the principle of a ten years scheme goes directly counter to the policy of the Government which I set out in the Budget speech with regard to the etabilisation of sugar preference.

5.  On a point of procedure Mr. Buxton&apos;s scheme, which involves the payment of excise duty by the home producer, would mean that a Ways and Means Resolution would have to be put down in the House of Commons,

presumably
presumably in connection with this year&apos;s  Finance Bill, imposing this duty, apart altogether from taking a supplementary estimate for the subsidy itself. This Resolution and the estimate could presumably only be carried with the support of the Conservative Opposition.

6. The output of home-grown sugar in the current year is said to have been 15,000 tons. I believe that the Ministry of Agriculture hope, if  a subsi?y be agreed to, that the output in the near future would rise         to some 31,000 tons derived from 250,000 tons of best. The acreage of boot? to produce 50,000 tons may be taken  at 5,000 acres, so if the Ministry of Agriculture&apos;s hopes are fulfilled, there would be in a particular year some 25,000 acres under boat cultivation. As the arable acreage of England and Wales is about 11,000,000 acres, only an insignificant portion of agricultural England would be affected. I do not feel that for so  Small a result it would be either prudent or consistent for a Free Trade Government to embark on a policy, the objections to  which on Parliamentary, fiscal and financial grounds are so weighty.
