;S ^nmMT^jPJ^E lWEItTY 0? HIS BRITAKjilC  MAJESTY13 GOVERNMENT).P.353. (24).0 A B I H E T,5THE AMRITSAR DISTUBBANCBS.01DW YER-SAJKAJAI UAIH LIBEL ACT ION.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India.     I wish to bring under the consideration of mycolleagues certain observations made by Mr. JusticeMoCardie in the recent libel trial of 0&apos;Lwyer versusSankaran Nair, which appear to me to require correctionin the interests of the public.     I raise no question as to the judicial qualitiesdisplayed by the Judge Jn his conduct of the case, or his directions to the jury on matters of lav/ or ofevidence given before him.  What I have to comment onare pronouncements on matters whioh were not issues inthe case, and on which neither argument nor evidencehad been tendered by Counsel.  The Judge was expressingto the jury his view as to what kind of action might properly be*termed an &quot;atrocity&quot; and that i3 obviously aquestion on which he was entitled to express an opinion and the duty of the jury to form one.     But in dealing with this question the Judge made twoinaccurate statements and asserted as sound a principleof civil administration which has consistently beenrepudiated in this country, in the Colonies and in India, as to the conditions under which an assembly of personsmay be fired upon or as in this case, bombed from aeroplanes.
                                                   U t) t     The untrue statements are these.   (I quotefrom the &quot;Times&quot; report,  not having&apos; the  official report before me.)        (1)  &quot;The action of General Dyer     received the approbation of all the     Military authorities.&quot;        (2)  &quot;In my opinion he was wrongly     punished by the Secretary of State  for India.&quot;     General Dyer was not punished by the Secretary ofState for India.  On the findings of Lord Hunter&quot;sCommittee,  the Government of India, i.e. the governor general in Council (see Cmd.705, 1920, page 25, para,44)reported that, after carefully weighing  all the factors in the case, they could arrive at no other conclusionthan that at Jallianwaia Bagh,, &quot;General  Dyer actedbeyond the necessity of the case, beyond what any reasonable man could have thought to be  necessary, andthat he did not act with as much humanity as the  cagepermitted&quot;, and that they had directed that thisjudgment should bo communicated to the C-in-C. withthe request that he would take appropriate action.Before this report had reached the Secretary of State,and prior to any expression of opinion by the Secretaryof State, the Government of India reported that theC-in-C had directed Brigadier General Dyer to resignhis appointment as Brigade Commander and had informed him that he would receive no further employment in.India, and that the Governor General had concurred.     The case was reviewed by the Secretary ofState- for the Cabinet, and  Mr, Montagu, not as Secretaryof State for India in Council, but on behalf of HisMajesty&apos;s Government, wrote a despatch,  speakingthroughout in the name of His Majesty&apos;s  Government inwhich he stated that he approved this decision and had referred the circumstances of the case to the Army Council.
      The Army Council concurred in the decision.      Whether, therefore, General. Dyer was rightlyor wrongly punished, he was not punished by theSecretary of Statet  nor is it true that his action received&apos;the approbation of either of the iailitary authoritiesofficially concerned with it.      The other matter on which the learned Judgesought to lay down for the guidance of the jury a principle which His MajestyTs Government cannot possiblyaccept,  appears in the following statement.      &quot;The jury would have to consider whether itwgs an atrocity to fire on the mob to prevent incidentswhich it was feared might occur.&quot;      It does not appear from the &quot;Times&quot; report whether this point was put to the jury and whetherthey did so consider; in any case Sir Sankaran Kaircould not have justified his imputation of responsibility to Sir Michael 0&apos;Dwyer. &quot;But the Judge himself apparentlyfavoured the view that it is justifiable to fire on a.mob to prevent incidents which it may he feared might occur.      In a further passage, he indicated the opinionthat an administrator would be justified in causingaeroplanes to use bombs or machine guns against a crowdwhich was about (in his opinion) to attack buildings orto murder.      The principle which has been consistentlymaintained in all administrative spheres of British  ,Government with which I am acquainted, is that no policeofficer or military officer is to fire on a crowd because he thinks it may be meaning mischief.  He is only to direct firing after he has ordered the crowd to dispersein which  case, if it  does not disperse, he may use suchforce as  is necessary,  including firing,  to disperse
it or he may order firing or force after the crowd has actually attacked; for example, if there is persistentstone-throwing., but this also only after warning.   Further,he is not to exercise more force; or to allow more firingthan is necessary for the purpose of dispersing the mob.The learned Judge in his charge apparently ignored theevidence that at Jallianwala Bagh the firing was continuedlong after its purpose had been effected&apos;, in a degreewhich, whether it might properly be Called an &quot;Atrocity&quot;or not, has shocked and horrified everyone acquainted with what took place,      I should be glad to take an opportunity of a question in the House of lords which I would arrange to be asked,or that a similar opportunity should be taken by the PrimeMinister in the House of Commons definitely to correct thetwo inaccurate statements of fact which I .have quoted fromMr..Justiee McGardie&apos;s charge &quot;(as to which, as I have said, he had had no argument or evidence before him -and which were merely obiter dicta) and also to reassert,contrary to the opinions expressed by the Judge as to reasonable cause for firing or bombing, the principles which have consistently been inculceted on civil administra-tors, and on police, and military officers, as to the soleconditions under which crowds, may be fired upon.      The latter pronouncement I regard as even moreimportant than the correction of the Judge!s mis-statements,                               (Sgd) OLIVIhR.INDIA OFFICE,      16th June,  1924.
Sir Archibald Williamson&apos;s Answer in the House           of Commons, 50th June, 1920.     My right hon.  Friend has asked me to reply.    As the hon.Member is no doubt  aware, Brigadier-General Dyer was relieved of his appointment  in India by the Commander-in-Chief in India,and consequently he is now unemployed and, under IndianRegulations, he is  in receipt of the leave pay of his rank.The conditions under which an officer can be dismissed from theArmy will be found by reference to Section 44 of the Army Act,The conditions under which he can be placed on retired pay willbe found by reference, to Article 527 of the Royal Warrant,   the disciplinary action taken by the Commander-ln-Chief in India in relieving Brigadier-General Dyer of his appointment was not taken under the authority of the Secretary of State for War or theArmy Council, and in this connection I may say that the Commander-in-Chief in India is under the orders of  the Government of Indiaand not  of the Secretary of State  for War or the Army Council.In reference to the progress which the Army Council has made withregard to the  case, I would refer  the hon,Member to my reply tothe non-Member for Eastbourne  on  the  8th  June last.   The  state-ment mentioned in that reply has  not  yet  been received in  theWar 0ffic6, but  it  is expected to-day.    The  conditions underwhich an officer can  appeal will  be  found by  reference to  Section42 of the Army Act.   The  Regulations governing  the  setting upof Courts of  Inquiry  will  be  found by reference  to Rule  ofProcedure 124  and  paragraph  666  of the King&apos;s Regulations.
    tfr. churchill&apos;s Answer  in House of Commons,             Dated 7th July, 1920,     I am about to lay a Paper on the Table indummy which will, I hope, enable Hon.Members to be inpossession of Brigadier-General Dyer&apos;s statement intime for the Debate tomorrow.   Everything will bedone to expedite it.     With regard to the decision of the Army Council,they have come to the following conclusion:   TheArmy Council have considered the Report of the HunterCommittee, together with the statement which Brigadier-General Dyer has by their direction submitted to them.                             mThey consider that,in spite of the great difficultiesof the position in which this Officer found himself on 15th April, 1919, at Jallianwallah Bagh, he cannotbe acquitted of an error of judgment.   They observe that the Commander-in-Chief in India has removedBrigadier-General Dyer from his employment in Indiaand that he has been informed that no further employment will be offered to him in India and. that he has in con-soquence reverted to half-pay,  and that the SelectionBoard in India has passed him over for promotion.    these decisions the Army Council accept.   They do not considerthat further employment should be offered to Brigadier-General Dyer outside India,
