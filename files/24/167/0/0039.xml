Capital for the development of the telephone system is     normally provided by advances made by the/National Debt     CommioDioners and repaid to them by means of annuities charged     on the Post Office Vote.    The advances authorised to date     amount to  69,421,083.          The last Aot was passed in 1933 and authorised the issue                      i     of oapital to the extent of  15.000,000.   This sum will, it     is estimated, be exhausted by July.    The Engineering Works     estimates sanctioned by the Treasury for the ourrent year will     involve an expenditure of about  8.200,000.   The present Bill     will;authorise the issue of  17,000,000, whioh, it is expected,     will meet the capital requirements of the telephone service     for about two years.          The  Bill has been approved by the Treasury, subjeot to     the proviso that the inoluslon of this sum will not prejudice     the discussions whioh will take place next year as to the     amount to be expended within the financial year 1985-2&apos;-..          The Bill will require  a  money resolution and it is     desired to introduoe It as early as possible after     Whitsuntide.
