M.P.,    Secretary of State for the Home Pepartgrent,        Home Office,..&quot;           London.
                                                     1......    9      The policy  of Bis Majesty -s  Government  is  stated  in the  lost paragroph of a despetoh  from the Secretary  of State for  the Colonies to the Governor  General of  the Irish Free State on the 7th April last in  the following words:             &quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government are prepared  on          &quot;any day upon which your Ministers may intimate          &quot;that  in their view the Conference has finally          &quot;failed, to exercise  all the povvers vested in          &quot;them  by Article 12 of  the Treaty  to constitute          &quot;the Boundary Commission&quot;,,. These words were expressly framed in view of two facts -      (l) the known intention of? Northern Ministers to refuse         to edvise the Governor to appoint a representative of         Northern ireland      (2) an opinion given by the  Law Officers of the Crown         that the Commission would not be constituted until         a representative bad been appointed by the Government         of Northern Ireland,A final request for the constitution of the Commission wasreceived from the Government of the Free State on the 27thApril and steps were taken the same day to request  theGovernment of Korth^rn Ireland to appoint their representative and to Invite Sir Robert  Bprden to act as the representativeof His Majesty&apos;s  Government,    He has now replied that hewill accept  the appointment,  provide^ that  both the Governmentof the Free  State and of  Northern Ireland agree to  it andappoint representatives  of their own.   This  reply  wasforwarded to both Governments on the same day that  it wasreceived (8th WAY)  and was probably known to  the  Governmentof Northern  Ireland before they despatched  the  reply  they
                                                          n had already  prepared  to  the Home  Secretary&apos;a  letter  refusing to.make  an appointment.   This refusal was. dated the 10th May and  received on the  12th May, end at the  moment  no reply be-- yond. an  acknowledgment dated 11th  May has, been received from them to the despatch forwarding Sir Robert Borden&apos;s message.     It  will clearly be  difficult, If not impossible, to find s man of judicial training v;ho will agree to  act as  Chairman until he is satisfied that the Commission over which he is asked to preside is in fact to be called into being.     That the Northern Ministers will maintain their refusal to advise the Governor to appoint a representative may be assumed,  unless or until it is decided that the scope of the Commission is by Article 12 limited to a mere rectification of the Boundary,,   In the event of such a decision they will probably reconsider their refusal.   But, except by agreement with the  Free State,, no such decision can be reached until the Commission is appointed and is able to declare how it interprets Article 12 o     The  question remains whether it  is within the legal power of His Majesty&apos;s Government to  instruct the  Duke ofAbercorn (his advisers having failed  to discharge  their statutory duty) to appoint a representative arid so enable      &apos; if, the Commission to be constituted,;   An opinion on  this subject,  even if given by authorities so eminent as the  Law Officers  of the Crown, will  scarcely  meet the case, because it would leave the validity of the award when made open to doubt,  and a  question of  such gravity would  be bound  to  come to the Judicial Committee of the  Privy Council for  final decision.   Fortunately,  however, it  is open to :11s Majesty&apos;s Government to ascertain the  views of  the  Judicial  Committee at once  under the provisions of the Judicial Committee Act of 1833,    A  pronouncement on the . point1)by  the Judicial Committee made in advance would in effect safeguard the
legal validity of subsequent proceedings conducted inaccordance with its findings,   Pledged as His Majesty&apos;3Government are to exercise to the full the powers vested in the Executive Government by law, the Constitution has provided them with specific machinery for ascertaining whatthose powers are from a  court which is at once the finalarbiter of British law and second in authority to none in                       ,                                 ... i ,J; ^ the world.     It is.therefore proposed that a special reference shouldbe made to the Judicial  Committee under the Act of 1833  andthat the Committee should be asked to report upon the following questions.:^     (I)  Whether, in the absence&apos; of a Commissioner appointed          by the Government of Northern Ireland^  a Commission        ... within the meaning of Article 12 of the Treaty will          have been constituted or can be competent to determine          the boundary under that article,,     (2)  Whether, if the answer to (l) is in the negative,          it is lawful for the Governor, in default of advice          from his Ministers, to make an appointment and so          enable the Commission to be constituted.     (o)  If the answer  to both the preceding questions  is  in          the negative,  whether there is any other constitutional          method of bringing the Commission into existence  so          long as the Ministers of Northern Ireland maintain          their refusal,                          (Signed)   J.H.
