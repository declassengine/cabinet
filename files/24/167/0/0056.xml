9 Q 96 0 6&apos;TS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY S GOVERNMENT.CABINET.353(24 )  WASHINGTON HOURS1  CONVENTION - QUESTION OP ACCESSION OP                             QERMAFlrj                   .      -                   Memorandum by the Minister of Labour.     It is understood that the question of the accession ofGermany to the Washington Hours&apos; Convention may be raised at the International Labour Conference which is now takingplace at Geneva, and It is necessary to decide what line should be taken by the British Government representative,  1understand from the Foreign Office that the question of a 10 -as opposed to an 8-hour day recently arose in the Britisharea of Occupation in Germany, when the view adopted by HiaMajesty&apos;s Government was that It was one of domestic Germanconcern in which they were not called upon to intervene.     2. In the discussions, that have taken place in thiscountry on the proposal of the Government to introduce legislation ratifying the Washington Hours&apos; Convention, thepoint has been made that Great Britain should not ratify theConvention whilst competing countries, such as Germany, donot adopt the Convention.  This is a point of which the mostwill be made in the House of Commons when I introduce theHours of Employment Bill,     3, Declarations have already been made at Geneva and elsewhere indicating that it is the intention of theGovernment to proceed with legislation dealing with theConvention, and it is difficult for the representative ofGreat Britain to avoid expressing the hope that theConvention will be adopted by all other oountries.     4.  On the other hand, the discussion at Geneva may very                                                   /likely                           -1-
                         -2-likely    embrace the. question of Reparations and it is necessarytherefore to hear in mind that the German Government maypload the &quot;eight hours day&quot; as justification for inability tocarry out the Report of the Experts; and although theproceedings of the International Labour Conference cannotbe held to commit the British Government in regard either toForeign Affairs or to Reparations, it must be assumed thatthe terms of any statement which the British government representative at that Conference may males on the subject at the present time will be watched with interest.     5.  Having regard on the one hand to the importance ofmaintaining our general attitude in favour of the Hours&apos;Convention and, on the other hand, to the need to avoid giving any handle to the German Government to seise to the detriment or embarrassment of the Allies in the Reparationsdiscussions, I suggest that the British Government representative at the International Labour Conference at Geneva should be instructed to say that Germany, and Germany alone, mustdetermine tha hours to be worked in Germany, but at the sametime he should be authorised - stating the position from thepoint of view of the International Labour Organisation - toexpress the hope that Germany may find herself able toadopt the Hours&apos; Convention.     6. The matter is urgent and I should be glad to have authority to telegraph instructions on these lines.                                        (Inild.) T.S.Ministry of LabourJune 17th, 1924.
