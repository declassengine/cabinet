3 $9iHIS BOCqMEOT  IS THE PROPERTY  OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY15 OCWSRHMBTOx,KO A B I H B f iRQAD IMPROVEMENT BILL.Memorandum by the Minister of Transport.        In pursuanoe of tho decision of the Cabinet on 9th July 40(24), I submit herewith the rough draft of a Bill, dealing with five matters which I believe to be entirely unoon- controversial, and which at the same time are of considerable importance to the Minister of Transport and to highway authorities.  It is proposed that any expenditure incurred by the Minister of Transport under any one of these heads should be met out of the Road Fund.     (1)  Road-aide tree planting.        The Bill proposes to confer on the Minister of Transport, and on all highway authorities, power to incur expenditure in the planting and maintenance of trees or shrubs by the side of highways, far the maintenance of whioh they are responsible.  It also enables the Minister to make grants to highway authorities out of the Road Fund towards expenditure incurred by them under this head.        Under the existing law it is only urban authorities who are empowered to plant, trees by the roadside, and no such general powers are* possessed either by the Minister of Transport or by County Councils.        Considerable attention has been drawn to the question of tree-planting in connection with the new arterial roads in the neighbourhood of London, and I am constantly being pressed In the House by members of the opposition to state when steps will be taken to obtain the necessary powers.    (2)  Experimental work.         Power is oonferred on the Minister of Transport to incur expenditure from the Road Fund on experiments connected with the user, construction, maintenance and Improvement of roads and bridges.
          I need only point to the fact that highway expenditurein Great Britain now readies a sum of over  40,000,000 a year,and yet it ia not within the competence of the Minister ofTransport or of any other authority to carry out the investigations and e xperiinents necessary to ensure that thisvast expenditure is directed to the best advantage.          A few carefully designed experiments and tests, on different forms of road construction, arid on the effects on road surfaces of different types of vehicles, might in the end.effect far reaching economies. -     (3)  Inquiries into Road Accidents..          A Clause similar to that in the Bill was recentlyinserted by me in the London Traffic Bill during the committee stage, and was accepted by all parties without any criticism.It gives effect to one of the recommendations in the second interim Report of the Departmental Committee oh the Taxation and regulation of Road Vehicles.     (4)  Abolition of Tolls.          Power is given to the Minister to contribute by grants from the Road Fund towards expenditure Incurred in the freeingof bridges or .roads from tolls.  Under Section 3 of the Highwaysand Bridges Act, 1891 ^ highway authorities may incur expenditurein this behalf.  The Minister of Transport however may only make grants towards the construction, maintenance and improvementof roads and bridges (Development&quot;and Road Improvement FundsAct,1909 and Roads Act, 1920).          It seems only proper that Road Fund moneys should bemade applicable to the abolition of tolls, and this the Clause  inquestion would effect.     (5)  Erection of Road Direction posts and Warning Sifns.          This Is another matter on which there is some doubt as to the powers of the Minister of Transport.
          It Is made clear in the Bill that the minister may make grants frcaa the Road Fund towards the cost of erecting directionposts and warning signs.(Initialled) H.G.12th July. 1924.\
