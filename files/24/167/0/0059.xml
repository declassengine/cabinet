DQOUMEtTT IG THE PROPERTY  OF HIS BRITAMIO MAJESTY &apos;S  GOVERNMENT)  278            CABINET.                             1         MILITARY MISSION TO FINLAND, Note by the President of the Board of Eduoation.       I wish to oall the attention of the Cabinet to  aquestion of polioy whioh arises on the Foreign OffloeTelegrams 14693, issued on June 10th, No06 on Page 3.It appears from this telegram that seven experts from  theAdmiralty, War Office and Air Ministry, with the necessaryolerical staff, are being sent to assist the finnish government in arranging for the defenoe *f tho SouthernLittoral of Finland and of Lake Ladoga.     I BUbmit tothe Cabinet the following considerations       (l) We are at this moment doing our best to reaoh           a satisfactory settloment on political and           eoonomic questions with the Soviet Government           of Russia,   Yet this particular moment is           chosen to send over a large military commission           to teaoh Finland, one of Russia&apos;s neighbours,           how to arm themselves most effectively against           her.   What would the Frenoh think if we were           to sond a Military Minsion to Spain to help to           fortify the Pyrenees?   What sort of despatch           should we get from Mussolini if he heard that           we had sent a full Commission of Experts to           teaoh the Serbo-Croats how to arm their new           frontier against Italy?  It is a definitely           unfriendly act to the Russian Government and           for that roason alone I suggest- to the Cabinet856(24),that it ought to be stopped.(2)  I put forward the  general  proposition  that no                                      military...
military assistance whatever ought under anyciroumstanoes to be rendered by any of theServices to any foreign oountry without theoxplioit consent of the Foreign Seoretary.  Itis a matter of foreign policy first and fore-most,    I have no knowledge as to whether thismatter was even brought before the PrimeMinister.I further put forward the suggestion that thematter is of suoh vital importanoe that theCabinet ought always to know if it is proposedto render this kind of military assistance toany foreign oountry.I should like the Cabinet to consider whetherIt should not be part of our general policy to abstain from such military advloe altogether,as incompatible with our new world attitudetowards foreign nations.   We do not any longerintend to seloot special nations for assistance and support.   We base our policy on the Leagueof Nations, which implies no sectionalalllanoes.   We have rightly been criticisingthe late French Government for the way inwhioh it has been arming and instructing in military matters its various vassal nations inthe East of Europe.   It is most objectionablethat we should begin to play the same game.Heoently the Cabinet decided that the Govern-ment was not going to sell any spare armamentsto any Country but rather to sorap them.   Itis proposed in this case to do a far more valuable military service to Finland than the                                  selling.....
selling of a large quantity- ox^amaments would-..be,   We must be consistent in our *r^*^Gy     It would therefore I suggest, be wise(a) to abandon this particular proposal atQnce; (b) to make it clear to the Services that military assistance of this kind i3 too import-ant a matter to be undertaken by them withoutCabinet approval, and (o) to decide that suohmilitary advice to foreign countries isgenerally oontrary to public policy.(intd)  C.
