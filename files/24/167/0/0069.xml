NOTE BY THE PRIME MINISTER.    THE  following  memorandum  has  been prepared  in  the Treasury by my instructions, and embodies a suggestion which has for some time been  present tomy mind for a Standing Committee, analogous to the Committee of ImperialDefence, whose function will be to examine, from the point  of view of ascertainedand ascertainable  economic  data, proposals of policy, potential as well as actual.The formulation and  decision of policy is a matter for the Cabinet.  The businessof this Committee (as is  the case with  the Defence Committee)  would be toensure that all  the  material  facts and  information  at  the  disposal  of  theGovernment Service are made  available  in practical form for use by the Cabinetin reaching its conclusions.   I am sure that my colleagues will agree with me inmy view that there is room  in  spheres other than that of national defence for a body similar to the Committee  of Imperial Defence, and that the precedent of thelatter Committee  provides an  assurance that the labours of such a body will beinvaluable to the Government.                                                 (Initialled)      J.  R.  M.    10, Downing Street, S.W. 1,         June. 30, 1924.                          TREASURY MEMORANDUM.              Foresight and Co-ordination in Economic Enquiry.    1. Experience of the problems, both of the war  and of the post-war period,has demonstrated the necessity for connected exploration of economic tendenciesas a preliminary to the formulation of Government policy.  That exploration mayproceed upon various lines, but the part  that  official  statistics must play in themajority  of  such surveys becomes  increasingly predominant.  The complexity of modern problems  and the new aspects given to them by the present abnormaleconomic conditions call for fuller knowledge of  the&apos; underlying and surroundingfacts.  It has  been  said, with  much force, that  in this age  most political and social problems are at bottom economic, and most  economic problems are  atbottom statistical.    2. In many proposals for change, or the resistance of change, controversy anddifference of view are inevitable, and, indeed,, frequently healthy. &apos; Experience hasshown, however, the abundant advantage of confining such differences so far  aspossible to the principles involved and of  having  for  the common  use a body ofmaterial facts so collected as to  be  beyond suspicion of any party.  Where con-troversy exists as to the adequacy, fairness  or accuracy of facts and statisticscompiled by bodies  which,  to  one  section of the community or  another, mustappear as partisan,  the search for economic truth is  made unduly difficult.  Thesuperiority of  official statistics over all privately collected facts  as a basis for practical  State economics, from this point of view can hardly be gainsaid, and theresponsibility of the State for the timely  provision  of material  appropriate  to      [11775B]SECRET.CP. 366 (24).(Final Copy.)
current problems, where the State  has  special facilities not otherwise available to individuals, is forcing itself upon public notice.   There is,  therefore, over and above the question of the pursuance of economic enquiry for State purposes, thefurther question of the publication in  appropriate  instances  of its statisticalresults and of the  publication of official statistics  bearing  upon the treatment of matters  of public importance  in the  economic  or  social  sphere outside  theimmediate limits of  Government  action.  The increasing  consciousness of  theimportance of  economic  and  statistical  knowledge  has, for  example,  foundexpression in  recent writings and speeches of the Prime Minister,* Mr. Baldwin,!Lord Salisbury^ and Sir Leo  Chiozza Money,! emphasising  the importance andthe comparative paucity of statistics dealing with  the division of  the product ofindustry and with the distribution of the national  income.   It is reflected also inthe general tenour of the  Petition which was prepared by a Committee of  theRoyal  Statistical Society, signed by a number of economists, statisticians, businessmen and others, and  presented to the  Government in November 1919, although many of the individual statements in the Petition&apos; proved on examination to bemisconceived.    3. No occasion has  occurred since  the armistice to make any detailed reviewof the methods  adopted in individual Departments for pursuing  economic-as distinct from statistical enquiries,  but of course the  Departments principally concerned possess  upon their establishments economists available for enquiries-either continuous  or ad hoc-which  the functions of a Department throw up.The methods of collection  and  presentation  of official statistics,  on the otherhand, have recently been the subject of a general survey.   The statistical field is a wide  one, inasmuch as, in addition  to administrative statistics produced forimmediate purposes of  State administration, other statistics, sometimes termedinformative statistics, have long been habitually  prepared and  published as abasis of publio information  on matters  affecting the welfare and progress of  thecommunity.    4. The review referred to was carried out by the Committee on the collection and Presentation of Official Statistics-a Committee, which was  appointed by the then Cabinet, sat under  the  chairmanship  of Sir Alfred Watson  and reported inFebruary 1921.H  This report recalls that no Government responsibility has beenaccepted in this country for the provision of statistics relating to the whole life and activities of the nation, and that the body of existing official statistics is to agreat extent the product of  accidental  evolution.  The  report mentions that  theprovision of informative as distinct  from administrative-statistics has been subject at all times to certain conditions  of which the following are the chief :-      (i.) The  purpose to be served must  be recognised to  be of  definite national           value.     (ii.)  The cost must be reasonable in relation to that purpose, i.e., it must be           such as  Parliament  may properly be asked to  sanction, regard being           had to the general financial position of the country.    (iii.)  The enquiries necessary to the collection of the material for the desired           statistics must not be such as to excite irritation and resentment among           those from whom the  information  has to be obtained; and, in close           relation to this point.    (iv.)  If compulsory powers are required, these powers must be such as Parha-           ment may be willing to grant, and the action  to  be taken under them           such as Parliament will approve.    5&apos;. Alike in relation  to economic enquiry for Government purposes-whetherproceeding from statistical research or pursued  in other ways-and in relation tothe publication of informative official statistics  as a basis of knowledge and actionoutside the sphere of Government, it will  be found that-subject to an exceptionwhich will be mentioned in  a  later paragraph  of this noteH-there has not yetbeen  established any  definite or considered machinery of  co-operation  between    *  1923.

 separate  Departments, either for laying down subjects requiring economic study, for thinking out the proper lines of development of regular Government statistics, for their systematic co-ordination, for the collation and mutual interpretation of related  statistics  gathered  by separate  Departments,  or  for the  occasional promotion of ad hoc statistical  enquiry in matters in which regular presentation or collection is unnecessary or undesirable.   These matters have in general been left upon the tacit assumption  that  informal  co-operation will be arranged from time to time as circumstances may require.    6.  But if  it  be granted that economic  foresight  and adequate statistical knowledge are  essential requisites both  for the initiation of  Government action in  new spheres (either positive, in the prosecution  of  proposals for change, or, what is perhaps  equally important, negative action in  resisting  or criticising suggested innovations) and  for the  progress  of  public  knowledge and  the better adjustment of  the  social and  industrial  scheme, this  assumption is  not watertight.    7. Where economic problems hang upon the fringe  between the territories of different Departments they may not be fully envisaged by any, and where economic enquiry  needs  to  be  pursued  primarily on  a  statistical  basis  administrative statistics which may be of the first importance to the Minister of one Department in the framing  of  policies may be available or  obtainable in another Department, but, in the absence of some regular co-ordinating machinery, the  knowledge of the need and of the possibility of its satisfaction may not come together, at any rate at a sufficiently early stage  in the development of a scheme of action.    8. In the case of  informative statistics, the need for  co-ordination is present in at least an  equal degree.   It is probably true of  many Departments it could hardly fail to  be true of some that sources of informative statistics continually cross the path of  the  Ministers duties, but  do not run along it. By a deviation he  may secure a valuable addition to  knowledge.   It  may happen that that deviation, despite  its value, is an embarrassment to  his own  special duties, and he may have no ready means to appraise the value if it lies in a sphere  outside the functions  of  his  office and outside  the sphere  of  knowledge  of  his  expert advisers.   Nor  is the advancement of public knowledge at present the care of any single organisation by which  such issues could be envisaged as  a whole.    9. It may  be  convenient to  refer at this  point  to a particular step towards co-ordination and collaboration which has  recently  been  taken in  the realm of pure  statistics.  The Watson Committee (see  paragraph 4 above) thought that a higher level of efficiency in  the collection  and presentation of  official statistics would be  achieved by a system of  regular consultation  between the statistical officers of the different Departments in a committee enjoying an official status, with  power to  make recommendations  to  the  Departments through  their representatives and so to secure that  purely statistical  considerations will be given due weight by the administrative  heads of Departments in deciding on the form and nature of the statistics they publish.    10. This committee is now  in being.  It is, however, purely professional.   It exists in order that the statistical officers of the principal  Departments may avail themselves of  cornmon deliberation  on subjects  of common  interest,  but  no executive functions or duties are assigned to it. The existence of the  committee&quot; serves an admirable object, for it keeps all the statistical officers in touch with one another,  and  encourages  consultation  between them in  connection  with new projects or the  curtailment of existing returns.  In addition, it has  prepared  and issued an admirable guide to  official statistics, which  has met with a wide welcome from the public.  But, in the nature of things, it does not go  to the root of the matter discussed in this memorandum, for it was not  designed  for thinking ahead&apos; as to  the future  requirements  of Government or  the nation  for new economic enquiry  or new  developments  of  statistical knowledge, and  has neither  the necessary constitution nor the necessary powers to that end.    11. It is suggested, therefore, that there is room for an organisation under the ultimate direction of the Prime Minister and the Cabinet charged with the duty of giving connected forethought from a central  standpoint  to the development of economic and statistical research in relation, more especially, to problems of  an interdepartmental character,  or in pursuit of knowledge in spheres not within the: orbit  of any single Minister.  It would delimit  new areas in which enquiry would be valuable, and explore the limits of its feasibility, and at the same time (as a subsidiary function I delhnit areas in which the production of statistics has ceased
to be of use.  It would be vital for  the success of  such an organisation  that it,should have among its primary counsellors the Ministers of those Departments.in which economic problems arise  and statistical material exists Ministers who,on  the active side, can alone compile  statistics and authoritatively interpret thematerial from which they emerge, and who, on the passive side, ean alone properlyvoice from interior knowledge any  reasons of public  policy or conflict with  generaladministrative polity to which, in  particular  cases, even interesting or importantstatistical demands ought to&apos; be subordinated.     12. Such a  suggestion is in no way new.   In a report on the machinery ofGovernment issued in 1918 by a Committee over which Lord Haldane presided-(1918,  Cd. 9230) the  case  is  set  out for making  further provision for  the organised acquisition of facts and information  and  for the systematic applicationof thought as preliminary to the settlement of  policy.  The report, in allusion tothe Committee of Imperial Defence, recognises  that  &quot; the exact objectives  of civil administration are less obvious and less easily defined than those with which  thenavy and the army are  confronted; and the elaboration of policy cannot be soreadily distinguished from the business of administration.&quot;  But,  subject to these limitations, the case is argued for  some general  form of organisation  to order invarious spheres the lines of enquiry and research.     13. The analogy for the body suggested in. the present note an analogy whichhas  been tested by experience may be found in  the  Committee  of  ImperialDefence.   The ultimate sanction of the body whose sittings would be occasionalas the business  before it might dictate would be  the Cabinet.  The president would be the Prime Minister and the regular Chairman, in the absence of the PrimeMinister, would be a Minister nominated by him for the purpose. As in the case ofthe Committee of Imperial Defence, the membership of this Committee would befluid in the sense  that only those persons would  be summoned on particularoccasions whom the President (or Chairman)  might invite on account of their interest in or their knowledge of the business on hand.     14. The President  (or Chairman)  would  also  summon for consideration ofparticular  business such outside  economic and statistical experts as he might think fit.     15. Such  a Committee on the analogy of the Committee of Imperial Defence would  as a normal  part of its working approve the reference  of particularenquiries to special  sub-committees, which  might include  outside specialists aswell  as expert  officers  of the  Department or Departments  mainly concerned.Provision would also  be made for using the  services of suitable DepartmentalOfficers in the capacity of Secretary to such sub-committees as occasion required.   1  16. Such an organisation a Committee of Economic Enquiry would seemto contain the necessary elements for the purpose in view, and to  achieve a three-fold object:      (a.)  To ensure that national  problems were actually being faced and thought           out in advance on a basis of fact;     (&amp;.) To assist the Government of the day with an organisation-stable but uot           rigid for exploring the problems in which it is interested, without  the           need of improvising co-ordination; and     [c.) To utilise to the greatest advantage the existing facilities of the Govern-           ment Departments under conditions most likely to command the ready           co-operation of their officials.&quot;Treasury Chambers, June 1924.
