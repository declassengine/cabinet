         JOINT   COMMITTEE                    ON THESITTINGS  OF  PARLIAMENT.OBDERED TO EEIPOBT :    1.  That the Committee have met and have inquired fully intothe subject referred to them.  The  Committee were instmcted to consider  &quot; the desirabilityof altering the customary period  of  the Parliamentary  Session,and the incidental changes necessary thereto.&quot;  The  evidence of Sir Leslie Wilson, Chief Government  Whipin the  last Parliament, and of Sir Arthur Thring,  the Clerk ofthe Parliaments, taken by the Joint Committee on the sittings of Parliament during  the  Session of 1923 was referred to thisCommittee.  In addition to the Clerk of the Parliaments, whoagain attended, the following  witnesses gave  evidence :-LardDononghmore  (Chairman of Committees), Sir Lonsdale Webster(Clerk  to  the House of Commons),  Sir Ernest Moon (Counselto the  Speaker), Sir 0. Niemeyer (Financial  Controller of theTreasury)  and  Mr. Graham Harrison (Parliamentary Draftsman,on behalf  of Sir F. Liddell, who was ill).  The  Speaker was invited  to give evidence.   But  while he expressed  himself as ready to place himself at the disposal  of theCommittee if they desired to examine him, he did not  considerit necessary to add anything to the evidence which  he had givenin 1914, as Chairman of Ways and  Means, before  the  SelectCommittee of the House of Commons on  their Procedure.  The  evidence taken before  that Select Committee was also referred to the present Committee.   Extracts from the evidence given before it on the subject of  the Sittings of  Parliament areprinted as an Appendix to this Report.  2.  The Committee had before them particulars as to the sittings of the House in recent years.  It appears that Autumn Sessions or Sittings have been held in no less than 15 out of the last 18 years.  They have thus graduallybecome the rule instead  of  the exception.    The  Committee,have therefore, come to the  conclusion  that, in considering the  The cost of  printing and publishing  this Report is estimated by the Stationery Office at M 15s.
question of the Sittings of Parliament, it must be assumed that,except under very special circumstances, an Autumn Session willin future be of normal occurrence.  3. Acting on that assumption, the Committee have given their consideration to the  question whether it  would be to the con-venience of Parliament, and lead to the more effective despatchof business, if some alteration were made in the present sittings of Parliament.  4. In the opinion of the Committee the present, normal sittings of Parliament are sufficiently  prolonged;  and,  any proposal forre-arranging the Sessions must be judged by the effect it is likelyto have  in shortening rather than in prolonging the total periodof the annual Sittings of Parliament.   In  this matter  they agreewith the view expressed by Mr. Asquith  before the Committeeof 1914 .-      &quot; I think,&quot; he said, &quot; that the Session is too long now, I    think it is having a very serious effect  not only on the health    of Members and the efficiency of Ministers and Departments,    but  also on the  attractiveness of Parliament to the kind of    man we want to have here.  I think our Sessions  are too    long, and I should deprecate  anything which  had the effect    of even indirectly,  although,  unintentionally,  adding to the    average duration of the Session.&apos;&apos;  (Questions 2178 and 2180.)  5. The Committee also have in mind the very real advantage which would accrue to Ministers and to   Members of  bothHouses,  and to the principal officers of the Departments of theGovernment, if an  annual  summer recess  could  be  definitelysecured which would coincide with the ordinary school  and familyholidays.   It  would,  moreover,  be  a great convenience  and relief to Members to know beforehand that their holiday would begin approximately on a certain date.  The present uncertaintyrenders it difficult for them to make private,  public and businessarrangements for the summer.  6. In  the opinion  of the Committee a definite Summer Kecesswould add also  to the efficiency of Parliamentary work.    the continuation of  the Session into  the iate  summer,  with  anexhausted  House of Commons, is not  conducive  to good workand good temper; and  the business of Parliament would be inevery  way more satisfactorily  conducted   in  the  months ofNovember and December  when  Members  would  come backrefreshed, than in the hot weather at  the  end of the summer.  7. Under present conditions, the Government of the day habitu-ally begins the Session as though there were to be no AutumnSitting and holds out some hope  that they will be able to complete the  work of the Session by sitting late into- the summer.  Thishope is  continually frustrated, Parliament sits far into August,and an Autumn Sitting follows.
4,97 question of the Sittings of Parliament, it must be assumed that, except under very special  circumstances,  an Autumn Session will in future be of normal occurrence.  3.  Acting on that  assumption, the Committee have given their consideration  to the question whether it would be to  the con- venience of Parliament, and lead to the  more effective  despatch of business, if some  alteration were mads in the present Sittings of Parliament.  4.  In the opinion of the Committee the present normal sittings of Parliament are sufficiently prolonged; and, any proposal forre-arranging the Sessions must be judged by the effect it is likely to have in shortening rather than in prolonging the total periodof the annual Sittings of Parliament.  In this matter they agreewith the view expressed  by Mr. Asquith before the Committeeof 1914:-      &quot; I think,&quot; he said,  &quot; that the Session is too long now, I    think it is having a very serious effect not only on the health    of Members and. the efficiency of Ministers and Departments,    but also on the  attractiveness of Parliament to the kind of    man we want to have here.

It  would, moreover,  be a  great  convenience   and relief to Members to know beforehand that their holiday would begin approximately on a certain date.   The present uncertainty renders it difficult for them to make private, public and business arrangements for the summer.  6.  Iu the opinion  of the Committee a  definite Summer liecess would add also  to the efficiency of  Parliamentary work.    The continuation of  the  Session  into  the late summer,  with  an exhausted  House of Commons, is  not conducive to good work and good temper; and  the business of Parliament would be in every way more satisfactorily  conducted  in  the  months of November and December  when  Members would come backrefreshed, than in the hot weather at the end of the summer.  7.  Under present conditions, the Government of the day habitu- ally begins the Session as though  there were  to be no Autumn Sitting and holds out some hope  that they will be able to complete the work of the Session by  sitting late  into the summer.  Thishope is continually  frustrated, Parliament  sits  far into August, and an Autumn Sitting follows.
  8.  At the same  time  it must be  recognised that the definiteprovision of a Summer  Recess would make an Autumn Sittin&quot;still more inevitable under normal circumstances.  9. In considering in the light of the above observations whatalterations, if any, might be usefully made in the arrangement of the sittings of Parliament, the Committee took, as a basis fordiscussion, the proposals made by  Sir  Leslie  &quot;Wilson in theevidence which he gave  before the Joint Committee last  year.That Committee was unable to report owing to the  dissolution of Parliament  (See House  of Lords Papers, 144, 161 of 1923.)  10. The proposals  were as follows :   That each year Parliament should be opened about the beginningof November and sit until just before  Christmas.  Dining thatperiod, Parliament should dispose of the Address in Reply tothe Gracious Speech from the Throne;  and,  in the House ofCommons, the Committees of Supply and  of Ways and means should be set up, and  the Supplementary  Estimates should be passed.&apos;   At the  same  time  the Second  Readings of the  mainBills of the  Session  would  be  taken.  The whole time of theHouse during this period of the Session was to be at the disposalof the Government.  The  House would  adjourn for a  Recess at  Christmas, andmeet again about the third  week in January.   From thence  itwould sit onwards,  with  the  usual  Easter and  WhitsuntideRecesses, until the 31st July, on which  day, under  a standing order, the business  of  the  Session would conclude, and theHouse would stand prorogued.  11. The main  object of the proposal was  to anticipate and  toremove  the pressure of  financial business which now prevailsup  to March 31st by disposing of the  Address and  the Supple-mentary Estimates before Christmas.  Hitherto that pressurehas usually  prevented  any substantial progress being made  inGovernment  business other than finance, or with the principalmeasures of the Session until after March 31st.  Then by  taking the Second Readings of some of the mainGovernment  Bills before the  Christmas Recess,  it  would bepossible&apos;not only to  set up the Grand Committees immediatelyafter the Recess, but to  refer Government  measures  to them  atonce.  The House itself  would also be in a position  at an earlydate in the year to go into  Committee of the Whole House onsuch Government Bills as are referred to it.  The ultimate object of the proposal was to secure that Parlia-ment should always be  prorogued  in  July and should not sitduring the late summer months.  12. The Committee agree that the proposal to open  parliament in November with the object  of finishing  the  Debate on the
Address, of disposing of the Supplementary  Estimates,  and of taking the Second Readings of important Bills before Christmas,in order that the more vital legislation of  the Session should begin in the New Year, so that the House should rise on July 31st,is an attractive proposition; and  they have given it their carefulconsideration.  This proposal appears, however, open to most serious objections.  (a) It  would  necessitate, without  question,  a ParliamentaryHitting in the Autumn of every year.  [b) While Parliament would,  of necessity,  meet three monthsearlier than is customary at present, there would be  no securitythat the Session would be brought  definitely to a conclusion atthe  end  of July.   It is recognised  that, in  view  of unforeseencontingencies, such as the Demise of the Crown, etc., July 31stcould not  be made a Statutory date  for  the prorogation ofParliament.  It  would necessitate the passing  of &apos;a  Standing Order tobring the business of  each House to an end on the 31st July.But a Standing Order is not sacrosanct,  and there would  be nothing  to prevent the Government suspending the  standing order whenever it  thought fit.   There would be  a constanttemptation to them to  do so in order to complete the full work ofthe Session instead of sacrificing a portion  of it.  ConsequentlyParliament, which had met in November, would often find itselfsitting into August.  There is no virtue in the particular date, July 31st.  It does not constitute  a &quot; dead-end &quot; such as,  for instance, is  the  case ofChristmas which would  normally bring about the  end of the session.   The Government, moreover, would be deprived of an effective  weapon which they are now able to utilise  in order tobring the Session to a  close in the Summer,  namely, the threat of an Autumn Sitting.  On the other  hand a fixed date would undoubtedly constitute an objective which the Opposition would have in mind in  theirdealings with Government measures and business.  In order, therefore,  to  enforce and to  secure the effectiveness of the Standing  Order the Government would be  tempted to employ the drastic closure of Bills, Supply, etc., beginning somelime before the 31st July.  This would be objectionable.  (c) One of  the main objects in view in  beginning the new session in November was that the Second Readings of importantGovernment measures should be taken before Christmas.   Theevidence given to the Committee, and  their own knowledge ofParliamentary proceedings, appear to them conclusively to  showthat, if the House met for a new Session each year in November,there would not be nearly sufficient  time at  the disposal of theGovernment to  enable  them to consider, prepare and draft theirBills before the new Session opened.
  Assuming  that Parliament  were prorogued on the 31st Julyaccording to  plan,  it is obvious that August  and Septemberwould be devoted by Ministers and Officials to a Recess.   Thesemonths,  covering as  they do the general holidays, are in any caseunsuitable for those consultations with  experts  which  are  afrequent  and almost a necessary part of the preparation of Bilk.The  Cabinet  would  meet  in October.   It would then  haveto  come to  its  final  decision  in  regard to  the Bills  it proposed to take at the forthcoming Session in November.  but until  the Government have decided on the main provisions of aMeasure  the  draftsman cannot begin drafting the Bill.  We are assured by Sir Arthur Thring, who has had great  experience inthe matter,  and  by  Mr.  Graham Harrison  (the  GovernmentDraftsman), that the drafting of  an important Government Billinvolves at least two, and very often three months for completion.  Apart  from the  original draft made  after the  Governmentinstructions are received,  an important  Bill often involves fifteenor twenty, amended drafts, most of which have to be referred tothe Cabinet  or  to  a Cabinet Committee.   Each fresh draftinvolves some consumption of time.  (cl)  As regards Supplementary Estimates, the Treasury witnesswas emphatic that,  while some  of the  less important Supple-nifcJitary  Estimates could be taken before Christmas, it would be highly inexpedient to attempt to prepare  or to take the bulk ofthe Supplementary Estimates in November.   It would be impos-sible for a Department to know in November, with any accuracy,what  their deficits were likely  to be in the following March; andto make  themselves safe, they would tend to over-estimate their requirements,  and the House, therefore,  would be .asked to voteEstimates which were misleading.  13.  With a view to meeting  these and other financial objectionsto the scheme, the question arose whether it would be necessary or advisable that  an alteration should  be  made in the financialyear,  that is  to  say, that the financial year should run from january  1st  to  December  31st, instead  of from April  1st  to march 31^t.   The Treasury witness pointed out the grave iucou-venience  which would,arise not only to the Treasury but to the taxpayer  by a reversion to the  old system, which was supersededin 1882.   In  any case the Committee  are of opinion  that suchalterations as  are required in  the  Sittings of the House  can  bemade  without any change iu the financial year.  14. After  having  fully   considered  Sir  Leslie   Wilson&apos;scheme the Committee turned their attention to another pro-posal for dealing with the matter which would  not substantiallyinterfere with  the  present  Sittings to which Parliament hasbecome accustomed, and  which would not in any  way  affectSupply or the Budget.
  15.  The proposal was that  Parliament  should  meet,  as now,after the turn of the year, and sit until near the end of July, withthe usual Easter and Whitsuntide recesses.   That it should berecognised that if the business of the Session could not be con-eluded by  or about that  date, Parliament should be adjourned until October or November.  The actual date of re-assembling for the Autumn Sitting would depend on  the  amount  of work  still  to be completed  before christmas.  16.  The advantages of  this  scheme are as follows.:     (a) While is presupposes, it would not necessitate, an Autumn          Sitting,  which, in favourable  circumstances,  might          sometimes be avoided.    (!)) The length of the Autumn Sitting would be  dependent          on the amount of  the  work still to be accomplished          before Christmas,  as far as.could be estimated by the          Government  in July.    (r;) The end  of July would not constitute a fixed period for          closing the Session, it would not, therefore, act as an          incentive to. the   Opposition to delay  Government          business.    ((/) Christmas would form an effective &quot;  dead-end &quot;  which          would  tend automatically to bring the Autumn Session          to a conclusion by about the middle or towards the          end of December.    (c) Tt   would  secure  a  definite and  recognised  Summer          Recess at the right time of the year; and Parliament          would sit under more suitable conditions in  November          and December than would be the case in the summer.    (/) The Government  would no longer  be subject  to  the          annual temptation  to  force through  legislation in          July  and August,  or even  September, in  order to          avoid an Autumn Sitting.    (r/) The financial  year,  and  the  normal preparation  and          presentation   of  Supply   and  of  Supplementary          Estimates, would not be affected.    (/() There would  be available  the same amount of time as          at present for the due drafting of Government Bills.  17.  As  regards Private Bills,  we were informed  by LordDonoughmore and  Sir Ernest Moon that  the  procedure in con-neetion with Private  Bills would  not be  adversely affected  by either of the proposals made.  18.  The  Committee, having explored the alternative  schemessuggested to them, are unanimous, both in the light of their ownParliamentary experience and as a result  of  the evidence theyhave heard, in rejecting  the scheme outlined in paragraph 10 andin adopting the scheme  outlined in  paragraph  15.  They recom-mend, therefore, that Parliament should each Session be adjournedon,  or if possible before, the 31st July, if it has not by then
  19. In connection with the schemes proposed, the Committeehad under consideration the question whether they should recom-mend that Parliament should meet somewhat earlier than  atpresent, say in the third week of Januaiw instead of in the firstor second week in February.                          \  The only Sta-commanding  Order of  the House  of  Commons whichwould require amendment would  be that which fixes the 5thlAugust as  the date for bringing Supply to a close.  This date would have to be advanced to a date  in July, e.g., 26th July.   Itis within the competence of the Government of the day to summonParliament at a  somewhat earlier period than is customary, if itis found necessary for this or for any other purpose or in order thata sufficient number of days should be allotted to Supply.(48620-33)  Wt. 7174-3079  1260 7/24  H, St, G.71completed the business of the Session, and  that it  should meet again in the/autumn to finish  such business as still remains tobe completed before the end of the year.
