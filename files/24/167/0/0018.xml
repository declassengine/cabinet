no0 A B 1 H2I.BJ!S!]MTlfe tS PtlRGrlAS:^ OP SMALL-HOLD ING8              IN SCOTLAIO.Memorandum by -the&apos; Secretary for: Scotland.     1.   Under the provisions  of  the  Small Landholders.(Scotland)Adts a considerable measure of  security  of tenure  is  conferred upon email-holders, but holdings under the Acta may,  nevertheless,be resumed by the owner on certain specified  grounds.    One ofthees grounds is that the owne2 desires  personally to  Occupy the holding, but he can avail himself  ef thi3 right of resumption1only if he possesses no landed  estate  other than the  holding haproposea to resume,   Formerly  this power of  resumption  wasrarely exercised and caused no  trouble,  but in recent  years therehave been a number of cases where,  owing to the break&quot;rig up ofestates, small-holdings have been  sold as separate subjects at prices, beyond the reach of the&apos;  occupiers, and the  purchasers,thug becoming owners of a single holding which ia.their  only.landed estate, have then proceeded to  exercise: their,  statutoryright of resumption for persons^, occupation, with-the &quot;resultthat the occupiers have been evicted.    This has given rise to serious complaints and has, not unnaturally, produced  a  feeling of insecurity amongst small-holders generally.   Moreover, in acertain proportion of such caaas the purchasers real  desire hasbeen to secure a residence, and not to engage in the  active culti-vation of the holding.   ^his has  led  to holdings,  which have beenformed by the State at considerable coat, be^ng diverted from thepurpose for which they were crestsd.     2.   The matter is one which  is causing widespread  anxietyamongst small-Jiolders,   It has formed the subject -of parliamentary questions and representations to my Deijaftmant.   Recently I received a deputation of Scottish Membere whs grossed me to finda legislative&apos; remedy.   Still more recently (on 9th April), thesubject Was debated in tha House of Ocmm/ms, and.in the  courseof the debate it was mads clear that there waB remarkableunanimity as to 1^he necessity for  an amendment of  the  law although not complete agreement aa to the method which ahould be  adopted.A Bill dealing with the matter has been  introduced by Sir RobertHamilton and is now awaiting Second Reading.     3.   The right of resumption  of a holding for  personal-occupation by the owner who had no sther property wag undoubtedlyIntended-to meet the case - probably a rare one,  but still one with a strong sentimental  appeal - where the hoiking wag the oldfamily home of the owner to&quot;which he deoired to return to apendthe evening of his days.   It was  certainly not in  contemplation,when this right was reserved,  that estates would be broken up,and small-holdings be sold as separate properties  to newindividual purchasers who  would thus be  enabled to  take advantageof a right of resumption designed to meet circumstances furida-mentally different.    It has also to be kept in view that the&quot;old family homo&quot;  case i.s  of necessity pre 1836 in date,- for3ince that date no one has been entitled to the privileges! oflandholder1 s/
Ill landholder&apos;a  tenure unless he has himself provided the major part  of  the improvements,  including the dwelling house and other buildings.    If  these have been so provided ainoe 1886 the holding  cannot fee described as the &quot;old family home&quot; of the owner.    So far,  therefore,  as&apos;the&apos; original purpose of the power of resumption for personal&apos; occupation is concerned,, it is probably fair to assume that it  is practically &quot;spent&quot;,  and that-the cases intended  to be- safeguarded have all  been met by-resumption having&quot; already&quot;taken-place in the course of the 38 years which have elapsed -since 1858.   Accordingly, it-may not unfairly  be  argued..tiuvt. t a.- repeal now this special power of resumption would not really be to take away what Parliament intended, to,:.give,, but&apos; would&apos; merely, prevent recourse to the power in cases to which it was never intended to apply.    -  4,  -  Various methods of dealing&apos; with the:-;situation have-- been  suggested.-&apos; These, jn*y be- summarised aa. foilow3:&apos;-:&quot;&apos;-    -  (a)  That the  small-holder should have a right of pre-     -      emption of hia&apos;holding ;at-:a -price to be fixed.,-- -     --&apos;    failing agreement&apos;,  by the Land Court.&apos;-:     (b)  That the  Board of Agriculture should purchase the           holding,  and retain the. small-holder as-tenant.      (c&quot;)  That- the  small-holder  should have,a  right to !,take his           holding in feu on terms to be fixed,- failing,agreement           by  the Land Court.                        / -   ,   -  (d)  That-the&quot;Land Court should have a discretion,  on the           &quot;greater  hardship&quot;  bnsis,  to grant  or refuse -         -  resumption.     .,    &apos;      (e)  That there 3hould  bea legislative  declaration that           the purpose- of personal occupation should no longer .  -           be  a good ground for resumption.               .   .   5.    The first two proposals would almost certainly involve heavy financial  demanda on the Government.    The first would clearly  be  oluaory  as a remedy unless the State,were prepared to advance  on easy  terms the capital  sums necessary to enable smallholders- to purchase, while the  second would involve State  purchase on what might  prove to.be a large-scale.   -If either of  these  proposal? were adopted,,it  seems certain,that&apos; many  landowners  would brin^  pressure to -bear  upon the occupants of small-holdiinge to induce  them to : purchase,-when-this  could be done  on&apos; terms not unduly  onerous to-them-, and thus ah - .  ,.-  - immediate  demand for the provi5tf.on of-public funds would enaue-.           The third proposal,, would-.avoid! this  financial difficulty, but  both it-and  the  first are .open to a serious objection from the  small-holder&apos;s point of  view.    Aa -the  law ntanda at  present a small-holder-is, rated, only as occupier,  ano. only  on  the unimproved value&apos;of  his -holding-,- wnich in Highland holdings is usually of trifling amount compared with the. full ahnual. value  of  the subject  as a&apos;whole.-.  If,  however,, the- small-holder  were to become  oWner of  -his holding,  either by - purchase or by feu, .he would  Pt  once  be rated,  both-a?, owner and so occupier, oh&apos;-.the full.annual value of the holding. Thia  was no doubt;the reason which led,the  crofters in, Lewis  to decline/
j. jf. hidecline  the  recent  offer cf their holdings as free rifts.  andI arc  oatisfi-edr-th-s^-the objection-is s&amp; serious as to rule outoccupying  ownership in any form as a solution unless at thesame  time  provision can he: made for deal in r. with the ratingdifficulty.           The  suggestion that the Land Court should have a discretion in  the matter must also, I think, he ruled out.It would throw unon the Court a difficult and invidious duty and would  not  definitely cstab]iah security of tenure, hutwould leave  the matter of resumption in such a state of un-certainty  aa to satisfy none Of the parties concerned.           There remains the repeal of the -provisions in theSmall Landholders Acts whlph, have Jiven rise to the difficulty,This  is  the  course  adopted&apos; in Sir-Robert.&apos;Hamilton&apos;s Bill,  butit will  inevitably  evoke strong opposition on the part-of thelandowners on  the ground thst it would&apos; go far to render small-&apos;holdings unsaleable and so subject the owners to an unfairdisability.  /  They  will undoubtedly press : fo.r the -adoption ofa scheme on-the purchase or feuing? basis,. coupled&apos;with, property ^.-&apos;vioionB  to. Obviate  the rating difficulty. &quot; -       &apos;-&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;.-.&apos;      6.  - .Aeauming  that financial considerations forbid the  &quot;&apos;adoption cf  State purchase through the Board of.-agriculture for Scotland or. purchase, by eraall-hqldere assisted, by Stateloans, the.scheme which would probably meet with, the least&quot;,&apos;&apos;opposition,  especially in the House of Lords, would bY one  -which would  give-the small-holder the option of purchasing or&apos;-&apos;feujng hie hoi din,:&apos;  at &quot;a1; price., orfpuduty,  ae the case might ;be,to be fixed, failing., agreement., by&quot;the Scottish Land Court.   -&apos;&apos;.The alternative right to feu would meet: the case of the small-holder whose resources were insufficient to enable him topurchase and so obviate a claim for&apos; State assists-nce;           Td. ma-ke. such.&apos; a scheme&apos; acceptable.&apos; to &quot;small holders- it -would be necessary  to provide&apos;that. the,.valuation for ratingpurposes of  the holding after purchase .o,r feu should continueto be. made.&apos;on  the- same, basis as before the transaction.  - Nedoubt, a. provision of. this nature would, appear ts be: productive&apos;of anomalous results.  &apos;  It would not.,, however, create theanomaly, but would  merely continue an existing anomaly in a slightly different  form...   In any cape, it would be supportedas a-  temporary- expedient pending a general/rating reform..&apos;   &apos;&apos;!  &apos;&quot;    .  7..,.&apos; -If&apos; we do  not proceed dn the lines Indicated in theforegoing,  para^rfljh/-we are thrown back upon the repeal of&apos; theobnoxious,  resumption provisions.    This course&apos;,- though certain to -.evoke, strenuous..bpno.sit&apos;ion from the landed interest, is,thesimpl eat.-method ^rbm-the. legislative point, of view,  end for/the-reasons  stated .In paragraph 3,  it seems, capable of a fairly, strong,  defence.&quot;  . It is: true that the limitation of the -:right&apos; o.f,.,,ros-consumption&apos;i:on/will militate against  the sale of smallholding 8 as  separate&apos; subject 8&apos;,&quot; but-&quot;the only potential-purchasers who. will, be ..di s.co,uraged are those whose&apos; primary object -de-.-to supplant-the eittin? tenant,        -&quot;       -. After full consideration of. all  the circumstances, - endafter -consultation  with/my&quot;Sdottish Labour -colleagues in theHouse,-.

It  -will be necessary,  however,to &apos; gc . a,&apos; 1 it tl e - further than a &quot;mere.&apos; repeal  of the &quot;personal  -                         &quot;&apos; -   &apos;-  -  -&apos;         - ,;-  occupationw/
occupation3 ground of resumption,&quot;   In my  opinion, we musta! as rsge&amp;l the words In &quot;Section&quot; 19 of the i3m3.H Land-holder a (Scotland) Act, 1911, relating to  f euin^^o-ther^i seI fear that a locphola. j lor.--e^ELLorr-would&quot;h-e .lef t.          This point is overlooked in Sir  R. Hamilton&apos;s Billhut it is one which must, I think, he met, if the  contemplatedlegislation-is to he effectual,   I may add that amplepowers of. fsuing for all proper purposes would still, remain,so &quot;that, on this head,  landowners would have no  just ground of complaint.          I attach a draft Bill to give effect to my proposals and I shall he glad to have authority  to introduceit in the near.future.     8.   The case as presented, in the foregoing paragraphsrelates&quot; particularly to the class of small-holders whopossess the full landholders&apos; tenure.   There is a furtherclass, namely, the statutory small&apos;tenants, whose tenurediffers in material respects from, that of  the land-holder,but who are&apos; also affected by the powers of resumption nowunder consideration.-   Their&apos; case for inclusion&apos;  in a pro-tactive measure - on any  of the lines indicated is not,perhaps, so strong as the case&apos; of,the small-holder in the fuller sense, but I think that they&apos; ought  also to be included.     9.   The proposals contained in this  Memorandum havebeen examined and concurred in by the Lord Advocate and theTreasury:  the concurrence of the latter Department is subjectto the understanding that there is no question of adoptingeither State-purchase or purchase^j by small-holders assisted by State-loans. .                    &apos; .   &apos;WM.
