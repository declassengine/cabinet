C.P.-363 (24).                                 CABINET.MEMORANDUM  BY  THE  FOREIGN  OFFICE  RESPECTING  THE                         YANG-TSZE  RIVER.         Proposed Building of Two Gunboats for Protection of Shipping.    IT is desired to submit the following comments to supplement tha memorandumof the 2nd June circulated to the Cabinet by the Admiralty.( J?.    2. The region of the River Yang-tsze, which numbers amongst its great citiesShanghai, Nanking, Hankow and Chungking, is the main centre of British interestsin China.  It was the  British sphere of  influence in the days before the policy ofspheres of influence was superseded by the more enlightened  policy of international co--operation,  which may  yet  for  all our  efforts relapse- into the old system  ofinternational competition.    3. Of late years there has been a considerable development of British interests on the upper part of the river  from Ichang to Chungking, where specially builtsteamers  now run when the level of the water permits (generally from  about  theend of April until October or November).    4. It is particularly  upon this  upper  portion of the  Yang-tsze, and  on itstributary  the  Siang,  on  which stands  the important  town of  Changsha,  that conditions have recently been so bad.   Not only is there much brigandage, but therehas also been a considerable amount of fighting between the rival armies of the Northand South,  which may recur at any time.   The resultant looting and disorders haveadded greatly to the  risks of  foreign  residents, and there have been  repeatedinstances of firing on foreign  ships.   Nor  is there any reason to anticipate a realimprovement in these conditions for years to come.    5. The Chinese authorities make no  attempt to patrol the river, and they  areeven powerless  to repress effectively  the disorders  on land, with the result thatforeigners must rely on the protection of their own naval forces, the presence ofwhich is provided for  under  the treaties.   Of the gunboats available for service on the upper river, it is understood that     Japan, whose interests, although very &quot;1    f 2 being 18 years old.         important, are less so than those  F  7 -I 1 being 13 years old.         of this country, has            J    ^4 under 1 year old.    The  United States  of America, whose (  \ ^rxrfaiS     &apos;   ,          -       .  n         ...              i     n   J  o I Bnt provision for o more is reported         interests are on a much smaller&quot;!    J     r    ,           .       1           ,                  ,       ,     i    on  good authority  to have  been         scale than ours, have at present     0 I         i.i          i                      &apos;-       r        I  8 L   recently sanctioned.    -p,        ,     .  ,                 If 1 15 vears old.    1 ranee,  whose  interests  are com- I 3 j j_3 rgars 0ld         paratively unimportant,  has      J    1 -^ v^ small *&quot;&apos;    Great  Britain,  with   the   largest&quot;! 9  /Both very old, 20 years or over,  and         interestsjtt stake, has only       J &quot;  \   underpowered.    6. If, therefore, His Majesty&apos;s Government are to provide adequate protection for their nationals and to safeguard British interests on a scale at all commensurate with their  position, it  is clearly necessary  to lose no time in building the two newgunboats recommended by the Admiralty.   Conditions in China are more likely to deteriorate than improve in the immediate future, and it is  far from clear whetherthe proposed  addition to our forces will  of itself  be adequate. &quot;While,  therefore, itis hoped that authority may be granted  for laying down these vessels forthwith, itis pro-posed that His Majesty&apos;s Minister  and the  Commander-in-chief on the Chinastation  should  be requested  to investigate  the  matter  further and report their considered conclusions whether  any further&apos; naval  protection is desirable, havingregard to all the circumstances  of the case, including the need  for strict economy and the  undesirability on general grounds of policy  of  any avoidable increase inarmaments..              ____      2276.  [117651   &quot;    [This Document is the Property of His Britannic Ma)esty&apos;s  Government.]                   Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1924.                -SECRET.
