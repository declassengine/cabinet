OLIVIER.  27th June 1924.         Telegram from Viceroy, Home Department, dated 25th June 1924.    D. 2014.  Reference to correspondence ending (sic).   Alipur conspiracy case.In our telegram  No. 86 G, dated 19th April, we have already informed you  of thegeneral considerations which determined  our action in authorising the  execution ofwarrants under Regulation 3 against the accused in this case.  The two main grounds.were, firstly, the imperative necessity for protecting Tegart and other police officers from the plot to assassinate them, the existence of which was proved beyond question,and, secondly, the increasing  gravity of  the general  situation  in  regard to revolu-tionary conspiracy in Bengal.    Subsequent proceedings and events  have fully  confirmed  the  views  we thenformed.  We have carefully examined the case  laid before  the judicial officers, andtheir report, copies of which have been transmitted to  you with our Home Secretary&apos;sletter, No. 104/1998 D, dated 12th June 1924, and we consider, (a)  that Santosh Mitraand his associates had before their arrest  been conspiring to assassinate certain police officers,  (6) that  during the  course  of  the  trial their confederates at large  had committed certain overt acts in pursuance of conspiracy, ta) that, under trial, prisoners had  continued to aid  and abet conspiracy by surreptitious  correspondence, and,(d) that there was every reason to believe that on release they would have resumed an active  part  in  the conspiracy.  As reported in our telegram of the 11th instant, wehave given the benefit of the  doubt expressed  by the judicial  officers  to  NarendraNath fSirkar, and  ordered his release, but we are convinced that there are the amplestand  most cogent  grounds for the detention of  tho remaining three persons, namely,(i) Santosh  Kumar  Mitra,  (ii) Dhirendra Nath Baghchi, and  (iii)  Sabodh KumarLahiri.7445    100  6.24
