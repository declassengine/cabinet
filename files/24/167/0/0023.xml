The genesis of the attached  draft Bill ie  to he found   in questions  which arose as to the necessity for continuing   the Sheriff Court House at Inveraray,  Argyllshire.            This Court  House is available  for sittings  both .   of the  High Court of  Justiciary on Circuit  and of the Sheriff   Court,  cut  no civil or criminal business has been transacted   in the  Sheriff Court  since 1919,  and the last sitting of  the   High Court  there was  in 1908.    In these circumstances there   appeared  to be no sufficient reason for  the continuance of the   Court House which involved the payment of considerable   maintenance expenses  by Exchequer.  The Secretary for Scotland   can by  Order  provide  for the&quot; discontinuance.of the Sheriff   Court but the High Court are bound by.statute to arrange  for   the holding of Circuit  Courts at Inveraray  if there are any   case:; and accordingly, it is impossible to discontinue the   Court Houoe without amendment  of the statute referred to.            The possibility of legislation was,  therefore,   considered  and the conclusion reached  was th-&apos;t it would.be   desirable,&quot;  if any legislation were introduced,  to  take the   opportunity of consolidating and  improving  existing enactments   relating to the holding of Circuit Courts of Justiciary.             The Court of Justiciary under this Dill will  have   more or less&apos;complete freedom in fixing the times and places   of Circuit Courts and thsre will be no statutory impediment   tO the discontinuance of the Court House at Inveraray.:             Opportunity has at the same time been taken to  make   certain amendments in the criminal procedure code designed   to facilitate and expedite proceedings.             The Bill, which haa been adjusted with the   authorities of the Justiciary Court and has the approval  of   the Treasury,  ehouM prove non-contentioua,  and in these   circumstances I aek authority to introduce it,  on the  : ,   understanding that time will not be sought to press it   through Parliament this Session should any serious opposition   arise^   It is possible that objection will  be  taken, on   grounds of sentiment and long usage,  to the  abolition of   the Circuit Court at Inveraray.                                      *  T^K.
