THE  CABINET.RELATIVE  RANK OF  OFFICERS  IN  THE  NAVY,  ARMY                         AND  AIR  FORGE.       MEMORANDUM  BY  THE SECRETARY  OF  STATE  FOR WAR.    With  reference  to  OP.  336  (24), wherein the  First Lord of  the Admiralty   300re-raises the  question  of the  relative  ranks  of  officers  in   the  thi&apos;ee  fighting  Generalservices, I desire to call the attention of my colleagues to the subjoined memorandum   7615which my  predecessor circulated in November,  1922,  as  OP. 4312, and in which I fully concur.              ...                                                  S. W.  THE  WAR  OFFICE,          2152 June, 1924.    The Chancellor of the Exchequer has circulated  a  draft report of the  Committee    100appointed under his chairmanship by the late Prime Minister to consider the relative  Gen. No.rank of officers in  the Navy, Army and Air Force,  with a memorandum,  OP. 4293,    7044dated 26th October,  in which he  submits  that the recommendations made in the draft report, although not accepted by the War Office and Air  Ministry representatives on  theCommittee, should be approved.    The  difference  of  opinion has arisen  on the question  of  the precedence to be accorded to Naval Captains, Commanders and Lieutenants.    The present table of precedence of these ranks is : Navy.	Army.	Air Force.Captain of 3 years&apos; seniority. Captain under 3 years&apos; seniority. Commander, but junior of the Army rank. Lieutenant-Commander. Lieutenant.	Colonel. l Lieutenant-Colonel. Major. Captain.	Group Captain. Wing Commander. Squadron Leader. Flight Lieutenant.The Chancellor and the Naval Member of the Committee recommend that the table of precedence as regards these ranks should be 		Navy.	Army.	Air Force.Captain. Commander. Lieutenant-Commander.&apos; Lieutenant.	Colonel. Lieutenant-Colonel. Major. Captain.	Group Captain. Wing Commander. Squadron Leader. Flight Lieutenant.2B/Ptg/364 100  6/24  W.O.P. 1399
 _______ThgcMilitary and&apos; Air  Force representatives on the Committee did not agree to any alteration of  the present rules as affecting Naval  Captains and Commanders ;  but, if anychange were  to be made, they thought that, in view of the early age at which a naval officer usually attains the rank of Lieutenant, the Junior Officers, of that rank, say, those with less than four years&apos; service as  such, should rank one step lower than at present,i.e., with Lieutenants of the Army and Flying or Observer Officers  of the Air Force.     The  Chancellors  proposals have the merit  of  greater  simplicity,  km are also recommended on  the ground  that  the  present rale  as  regards   Naval Captains andCommanders leads to difficulties when British Naval  Officers meet foreign  Naval andMilitary  Officers ; but the  Army Council cannot agree that these  considerations affordany justification for lowering the status of British  Army Officers.   They urge that  theresponsibility of a Lieutenant-Colonel commanding a regiment of cavalry or a battalion of infantry is surely greater than  that b&apos;f  a  Commander in the Navy, and they see noreason for altering the table of precedence of  those&apos; ranks, which has  stood the test of time and experience, and has not given rise to any insurmountable difficulties.     There is, further, an important financial consideration.   It is true that, the terms ofreference to the Gbm&apos;mitte6  preclude  atiy  effect  on  p&apos;a&apos;y, but in ftfct they offer n!o&apos; reliablesafeguard on that point.   At no very distant date, the simple fact would have to be facedthai the junior  Captain in the  Navy is  senior  io the  senior Lieutenant-Colonel in theArmy ; and  so on.   Moreover, while the reference precludes  any  reopening of the scale of pay in  consequence of the  alteration of relative  rank,,  it does  not  (even  in terms)preclude the  taking into consideration of relative rank in a general resettlement of payarising independently, such as is now in prospect.     The present table of relative rank, age and. service being taken  into account, is by nomeans disadvantageous to  Naval Officers, and the Army Council can see no  reason for raising their  status.   They recommend that the  present rules should be maintained.                                                                               D.20th November, 1922.
