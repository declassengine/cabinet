A B IOI        USE.  OF. NMAX  HBgaggMBI IN  INDUSTRIAL DISPUTES.     C b        MEMORASDUM BY TEE FIRST LORD OP  THE  ADMIRALTY.                It will be  remeiabero4 that when at  the  Cabinet      meeting  en&apos;Friday 6th Jane the Cabinet had under their      consideration the question of  using  Naval ratings to run the      Electric Power  Stations, they  ware  informed,  on the  authority      of the Lord Advocate  and the permanent Under-Seoretary  of  State      for Home Affairs, &quot;that  the necessary  legal powers existed,      &quot;but that  in the past the  Admiralty  had wished  to avoid      &quot;using Naval ratings  in  this way before the issue of an      &quot;Emergency  Proclamation&quot;.                I think that the Cabinet should be  made aware that      this advice is  contrary  to the opinions given by the Law      Officers of the  Crown, the judge Advocate General and the      judge  Advocate  of the Fleet when this  subject was considered      in the winter of 1919-19SO.    I attach copies of these  opinions,      the effect  of whioh is to  lay  it down  definitely that an order      to Naval personnel  to run the  London Electric power  stationa      is not a &quot;lawful command&quot; within the meaning  of the  Naval      Discipline  Act  unless such a condition of affairs has arisen      that the safety of  the Realm and the existence  of the Kingrs      Government  and  authority are endangered and consequently      His Majesty acting  through his responsible Ministers has      decided  to entrust  this  Bervica to military administration      or    control,  - the  proper  method of  notifying which is a      Royal  proclamation.                In  view  of  the Cabinet  deoision of  last Friday,      I gave instructions for  all.  requisite  steps to  be taken to      hold.  lava! ratings  in readiness to proceed on this service  at                                                 short.....
hi IJ tjshort notice, in case of necessity, in spite of the factthat it would he open to any Kaval rating receiving such  anorder to refuse to comply with it,   I did so in the confidence that on this occasion the Admiralty would receive timelywarning beforehand from the ilavai Depots, if there were any possibility of this difficulty arising, and that in that  casethe royal Proclamation would be issued before a situation sodisastrous to the discipline of the naval Service actuallyoccurred,          I urge most strongly, however, that this is a risk which should not ordinarily be taken.   In view of thefact that this matter may become one of urgency at any moment, I circulate this memorandum without prior cons aIt a-tion with the Secretaries of State for War and Air,                               (Intd) 0.

Each oommand must be judged on its own merits.          It must not&apos;&apos;be;  orgertften that the question arises in relation to a criminal matter, for disobedience to alawful command entails any punishment be low penal servitude,          lbs re are duties which all members of the communityare morally bound to perform, e,g, to give assistance in times of emergency, but a refusal to perform such dutiesunconneoted with the service to whioh he belongs cannot, inmy opinion, be turned into a orime merely beoause the personrefusing the duty belongs to a disciplined foroe,          I think the following principles may be laid down:-     (1)  that the lawfulness of the command does not          primarily depend on the lawfulness of the act          ordered to be done, but upon the duty of the          person giving the order to give it;     (2)  that no order to do an obviously illegal act          can be a lawful command;     (3)  that the act to be dons must be directly or          indirectly connected with the service, and     (4)  that it must be such an act as the person to          whom the order is given may reasonably be          considered to have undertaken to do as part of          his ordinary, or in an emergency, his extra-          ordinary duties&apos;.          Ho difficulty is likely to arise with regard toorders to be obeyed within the ship..   With regard to actsto b* done  outside the ship in circumstances such as aredisclosed in these papers, it is extremely difficult to draw the  line between what is a &quot;lawful command&quot; and what is not;
0 *Vthe difficulty trising from the application of theprinciples  (3) and  (4).   For instance, there ccn be nopo&amp;sible doubt that it would be s lawful command to order a party to fetch stores required for the ship awaitingdelivery at a Railway Station.  I think it would be alawful command to order competent engine-room ratings to drive the train in which those stores were, from anotherstation to the place where they wera required; but it wouldnot. in my opinion, be a lawful command to order them to drive a train upon which were passengers travelling on thoirown private business or pleasure, because such an act wouldnot be directly or indirectly connected with the Service,nor would it be lawful to order - say - a Paymaster Sub-lieutenant to drive any train, because it is not a dutywhich he could reasonably be considered to have  undertaken,,          Nor &amp;o I consider it would be a lawful command to order ratings to go ashore and sweep the streets whon thescavengers had gone on strike, because such wort is not directly or indirectly connected with tho Navy,  and does notarise out of suoh an emergency,  as  the Navy as an organisedbody of men might reasonably be expected to meet.     *                      (intd).

        Opinion of the Jud(:,e, Advocate l-lenerf&apos;!.lo    &apos;    The question raised I understand to be whether an order to soldiers or airmen to carry on vital services in the event of a strike is a lawful command so as to rendethose, who collectively or individually disobey such anorder, liable to the penalties for mutiny or disobedienceof a lawful command under the / rmy and Air Force Acts whichare death or such less punishment:as in the Acts provided,As there is no difference between the case of soldiers and airmen, I deal in the subsequent paragraphs with soldiersonly, but they must he taken to f-pply to both solaiers and airmen alike,2,        By vit: 1 services I understand to he meantservices, the non-performance of which would in a short period of time bring the whole life of the community to anend, such as transport, water supply, mining, lighting and food production.  Whether a strike in any such industry in fact becomes threatening to the life of the community mustin large measure depend on the efforts made to replace the strikers by other voluntary civilian labour.3,        It has sometimes been contended that a lawfulcommand means any commend which is not contrary to theordinary law of the land,  But this is not the view takenin the Manual of Military Law, see paragraph 10 on page 16and note 6 on page 383, and it has been decided in theCourts, not to be the correct view, see garden ve Baileyreported in 4 T .iuiton&apos;s Reports at page 67 and B&amp;iley v.Warden reported in 4 Maulo and SelwynrB Reports at page400,  I am of opinion that a command to be lawful mustbe both not contrary to any law of the land and also withinthe scope of military service end authority,4,        In determining what commands&apos; fall within the                                                 scope....

                                                      2  tiscope of military service regard must be had to the army act and the soldier1 s attestation.  In the preamble tothe Annual Act the purpose for which the land Forces are maintained is stated to be &quot;the safety of the UnitedEingaom and the defence of the possessions of His MajestyTsGrown&quot;.  A soldier by his attestation engages to serve HisMajesty and by his oath swears that he will as in dutybound honestly find faithfully defend His Majesty, HisHeirs and Successors in Person Grown and Dignity against allhie enemies and that he will observe and obey all orders ofHis Majesty His Heirs snd Successors and of the Generalsand Officers set over him.  Accordingly the duties which a soldier undertakes when he enlists are to defend His Majesty,His Heirs and Successors His Crown and Dignity against all his enemies foreign and domestic, to train and preparehimself for&quot;that purpose and to do all acts and thingsconnected therewith or incidental thereto, and in connectionwith such service to obey the orders of His Majesty or anysuperior officer,50        Applying these principles to the question underconsideration I am of opinion that a soldier oahnot lawfullybe commanded to perform  vital services except under thefollowing conditions    (a)   if and in so far as some military object purpose          or proceeding in the sense indicated above is          affected;or  (b)   If such a condition or affairs h s arisen that          the safety of the realm and the existence of the           Lag&apos;a Government and authority are endangered          and His Majesty acting through His responsible          Ministers to save the State has decided to entrust          any such service or services to military          administration and control.6.        With regard to (a) of paragraph 5 the followingexamples will serve to make more clear what is meant.  a soldier can be required to run trains conveying troops or military stores or munitions but not trains carrying civilian                                               passengers....
                V  -3-passengers or traffic unless some special military objectwere served thereby, as might be the case in war time ifcivilian workers had to be carried to and from munition factories,  The  preservation of collieries frcm lastinginjury in consequence of pumps not being worked might bean object of military importance as the wavy and Army might otherwise for a  long time be deprived of their supplies ofcoal,,  The application of this principle to individual cases must depend on the special facts and it is obviousthat different considerations would arise in peace and war,&apos;70        With regard to (b)  of paragraph 5 the steptherein referred to of handing over vital services to military administration and control is one that can only bejustified on the ground of danger to the safety of the realm whioh pursuant to the preamble of the Army Act theArmy exists to maintain,  and is a measure -to--which recoursecan only properly be had in the last resort.   Before sucha step is taken it would probably be desirable to issue  a proclamation bringing home to the minds of all concerned the grave national danger which had arisen..

Opinion of the Law officers of the Crown.1.        We agree with the opinion of the Judge advocate general that such orders as are referred to can legally begiven only under one or other.of the two conditions specified by him in paragraph 5 of the opinion.  Except under one orother of those conditions we do not think that a member ofHis Majesty&apos;s Forces is under any higher or other duty to perform such services than if he were a civilian.2.        The same conditions apply to this question.   Ifthe orders&apos;can legally be given they are lawful commands soas to render the persons disobeying them liable to thepunishments provided for disobedience to lawful commands sotforth in the Acts mentioned.(Signed)   GORDON HHSAttD.(Signed)   ERNEST M.POLLOCK.
