[This Document  is the  Property of His Britannic Majest/s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.  June 1924.SECRET.CP. 359/24.CABINET.RELATIVE  RANK  OF  OFFICERS: IN  THE  NAVY,  ARMY  AND                           AIR  FORCE.    AS the First Lord points out in CP. 336(24), the question of the relative rank of officers of the Navy, Army and Air Force has been before the Cabinet since April1921.   I  share his view that an early settlement of this question is desirable in theinterests of all three Services.    The recommendations of  the Baldwin Committee are unacceptable to the AirMinistry for the  reasons set forth in two memoranda (CP. 4107 and CP. 4349)circulated to the Cabinet in July and December 1922, copies of which are reproducedherewith for convenience of reference.                         ,            . ,.    I desire to endorse the views expressed in these memoranda by my predecessors.    In particular, it seems to me anomalous that Naval Sub-Lieutenants, whose agewill never exceed 23,  should rank with  Army Lieutenants  and  Air Force FlyingOfficers, who may be as much as 30, and that  these latter officers should rank juniorto Naval Lieutenants of whatever seniority.  The  Air Ministry propose that infuture Naval Sub-Lieutenants should rank with Army Second-Lieutenants and AirForce Pilot Officers; that Naval Lieutenants of less than four years&apos; seniority shouldrank with Army Lieutenants  and Air Force Flying Officers; and that  only NavalLieutenants of four years&apos; seniority and over  should rank with Army Captains andAir Force Flight-Lieutenants.    I commend these proposals to the Cabinet as a reasonable method of rectifyingthe existing anomalies in these ranks, on a basis which takes account of comparativeages and responsibilities.    My colleagues may feel that the determination  of relative rank in the three services is,a complex question, involving  a number of technical factors, on which itwould be difficult for them to pronounce judgment; in this event I desire to supportthe First Lord&apos;s proposal that the Lord Chancellor should be invited to undertake the role of arbitrator,  if he is willing to do so.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR.T.Air Ministry, June 23, 1924.Secretary of State for Air.L11720J
CP.  4107.                                 CABINET.RELATIVE RANK OF OFFICERS  IN  THE NAVY,  ARMY AND                            AIR FORCE. -              MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR.    1. ON the 27th April,  1921,  I circulated a memorandum  to the Cabinet onthis subject, CP.  2890,  agreeing  that the position  in regard to relative rank ofofficers in the Navy, Army and Air Force was unsatisfactory.    In view of the length of time which has elapsed  I think it well to recapitulateand amplify the original views of the Air Council.    2. The present position is as shown in the following relative table : Navy Ranks. -	Army Ranks.	Air Force Ranks.Admirals of the Fleet. Admirals. Vice-Admirals. Rear-Admirals. Commodores. * Captains of 3 years&apos; seniority. Captains under 3 years&apos; seniority. Commanders. Lieutenant-Commanders. Lieutenants. Sub-Lieutenants.	Field-Marshals. Generals. Lieutenant-Generals. Major-Generals.. Colonel-Commandants.* Colonels. Lieutenant-Colonels. Lieutenant - Colonels, but junior to this rank. Majors. Captains. Lieutenants. Second Lieutenants.	Marshals of the Air. Air Chief Marshals. Air Marshals. Air Vice-Marshals. Air Commodores. Group Captains. Wing Commanders. Wing - Commanders, but junior to this rank. Squadron Leaders. Flight Lieutenants. Flying Officers. Pilot Officers.* These two are temporary ranks.  Air Commodore is substantive.    3.  This Table is believed to be the result of an effort to establish it on a basisof relative ages in the two Services and to distribute the ranks accordingly.   thus a Colonel in the Army takes rank with a Post-Captain in the Navy, provided thelatter be over  three years&apos;  seniority.  It is probable that  the  position  as regardsrelative ages in the two Services is quite different from what it was when the existingscale of relative ranks was evolved.   However that may be, Naval Captains with less than three years&apos; seniority are forced into the same  relative position  as thenext rank below them in their own Service, i.e., Commander.    4.  The  suggestion in the  Admiralty  Memorandum,   CP.  2805, that  recentaction  on the part of the  Air  Force has  contributed to  the difficulty cannot beaccepted.  So  far as officers of  the Air Force are concerned, when  their  titles werethe same as for the Army,  they had by law  a vested right to the same relativerank;  when their titles were changed by King&apos;s Order to those which now obtain,their position as regards relative rank was still  secured  to them by the King&apos;sOrder.   It cannot be admitted that this involved any fresh claim.    5.  The  specific points  dealt with in  the  Admiralty  Memorandum  are reallyan issue between the Admiralty and the War Office, the Air Force not being concernedexcept in so  far as vested rights are affected.    6.  The ranks of Commodore and  Colonel-Commandant in  the Navy  and Armyrespectively  are temporary ranks, whereas that of Air Commodore in the Air force is substantive.  This does not appear  of any great relative  importance.  This rankwas made substantive by the  Air Force to comply with carefully considered  policy,namely, that the Air Force should have no temporarv ranks and thus avoid whatwas considered one of the greatest drawbacks to the older Services, i.e., the sudden
granting of temporary higher rank and  the subsequent ^reversion to a lower rank,which  no  officer likes.  The Air  Force  being untrammelled  by tradition,  it wasdecided to create the substantive rank equal to the temporary  ranks of Commodoreand  Colonel-Commandant in the other two Services, with regard  to the pay, theduties, and the responsibilities that officers of that rank would have to undertake.    7.  With regard to the relative ranks of junior officers, it is considered that thegreat disparity in age between Flying Officers  and Lieutenants in the Army on theone hand and Sub-Lieutenants in the Navy on the other, is unsatisfactory.    The Sub-Lieutenant, R.N.,  rarely exceeds the age of 22 or  23, whereas the flying Officer can attain the age of 30, and will as a- rule not be promoted to FlightLieutenant before he  reaches  the  age of  25.    It is considered  therefore  that the flying Officer and Lieutenant of the Army should rank with Lieutenant, R.N.,and that Flight  Lieutenants and Captains should rank with Lieutenants, R.N., of four years&apos; seniority and over, thus bringing their ages more nearly in line.    the point is of importance, as it ensures equity of treatment when dealing inthe future with questions of pay or pension, or other vested rights.    8.  That the Admiralty have realised  the anomaly created by disparity  of age and rank when officers of military rank are in contact with Naval  officers appearsto be borne out by the fact  that an arrangement to overcome this has been effected in the  case  of  Marine  officers when embarked.   The regulations to effect  this,which are based  on length of  service from date of entry, have  the result of makinga Lieutenant of Marines, on completing four  years&apos; service  from date of entry,rank with Lieutenant, R.N., and Lieutenant or Captain of Marines, on completingtwelve years&apos; service from date of entry,  to rank with Lieutenant-Commander.    The Air Council therefore propose the following table  for acceptance: Navy Rank.Army Rank.Rear-Admiral.Commodore.*Post-Captain.Commander.Lieutenant-Commander.Lieutenant of 4 years&apos;  seniority  and over.Lieutenant   under   4   years&apos;  seniority.Sub-Lieutenant.Major-General.Colonel-Commandant.*Colonel.Lieutenant- Colonel.Major.Captain.Lieutenant.Second Lieutenant.Air Force Rank.Air Vice-Marshal.Air Commodore.Group Captain.Wing Commander.Squadron Leader.Flight Lieutenant.Flying Officer.Pilot Officer.Temporary rank.A ir Ministry,    July 14, 1922.F.

CP.  4349.                                  CABINET.RELATIVE RANK OF OFFICERS  IN  THE  NAVY, ARMY AND                            AIR FORCE.              MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR.    WITH reference to the draft report of the Committee under the chairmanship of the Chancellor of the Exchequer on  the subject of the relative rank of officersin the Navy, Army and Air Force, and the  Chancellors memorandum OP. 4293,in which he submits that the recommendations made in the draft report, although not accepted by the War Office and Air  Ministry representatives on the Committee,should be approved, I desire to associate myself generally with the remarks submittedby the Secretary of Sfate for War in his memorandum CP. 4312.    2. The Air Council desire to call attention to  paragraph 4 of my predecessor^memorandum CP. 4107, where it was pointed out  that the introduction of the newAir Force  titles did not affect the vested right of the Royal Air Force Officers tothe relative rank of the corresponding military titles which  they had previouslyenjoyed.    3. As regards the relative rank assigned in the draft  report to Sub-Lieutenants,R.N.,  maintaining  their  position on  a level  with Lieutenants  in the Army and flying or Observer Officers in the Air Force, the Air Council wish to point out thatthe Sub-Lieutenant, R.N., is a young officer learning his  profession, and who neverexceeds the age of 23 at the utmost.  His position and responsibility are very similarto those of a Second-Lieutenant in the Army or a Pilot Officer in the Royal AirForce, and  the Air Council consider that his relative rank should correspond to thoseranks  accordingly.   It should be  remembered that the  period of service as Sub-Lieutenant . is invariably of short  duration,  whereas  the period of  service  ofa Lieutenant in the Army and a Flying Officer in  the Air Force will  always be of much greater  duration, and the Air Force will always  have  officers  in this rankapproaching the age of 30.   It appears to the Air Council undesirable that a youngNaval Lieutenant should take precedence both in service matters and in social lifeover Lieutenants in the Army  and  Flying Officers in the Air Force, who are considerably his seniors in yecirs, who have passed  through almost exactly the samecourse of training, and  who have had longer service  and wider experience.    4. It may be pointed out that  the  Admiralty, in selecting a specialist branchof Naval Officers  for observing duties in aircraft have selected officers of the rank of Lieutenant.  As the pilot who will control the  aircraft is almost always of the rank  of Flying Officer, the  anomalous position will arise under the present table,which, as regards the junior ranks, the  draft report proposes to maintain, that theofficer commanding and controlling the  aircraft will almost invariably be junior tohis observer, though often considerably the senior in age and experience.    5. A  further  point to  which I wish to  draw attention  is  the effect of  anyrelative rank assigned to the executive branches of the three Services on the technical,administrative and other branches.  It does not appear either just or reasonable,for instance, that a Medical Officer, who enters the Royal  Navy as a Lieutenant,should, if he enters the R.A.M.C. or the R.A.F., enter in a rank relatively lower.                                                                       S. H.    A ir Ministry, December 7, 1922.
