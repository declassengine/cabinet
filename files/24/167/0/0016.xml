CABINET.              proposed Bill to deal  with  Road-side Tree-              planting and Experimental work  In connection-SET.           with the User,  Construction, Maintenance and              Improvement  of  Roads and Bridges.&apos;.514(24)*                     ,__                Memorandum by the  Minister of Transport.         In connection with the Ministry of Transport Vote whichis to be taken on May 29th, I desire the permission of the Cabinetto promise to introduce legislation on one or two uneontroversialpoints on whioh I have been pressed.   I should, of course, announce that the Bill could only be proceeded with, If. it is unopposed, but so substantial is the agreement an many points that I, eel confident that I could get a tiseful piece of legislation without any debate on second reading or report.          The scope of the Bill would include power to planttrees by roads, power to make experiments in new road surfaces,power to contribute to the abolition of tolls, and possibly powerto hold inquiries into road accidents and for the erection of warning signs or direction posts.          I seek leave therefore to prepare a Bill of this naturefor submission to the Cabinet, and at the same time I desire leave to state, in deallng^with my estimates, that suoh a Bill will beintroduced and will inolude the two following points          Tree-planting, by tha^ side of the, hJ.fih.way.,     (a)   enabling the Minister of Transport to incur expenditure          from the Road Fund in the planting and maintenance of          trees or shrubs by the side of highways constructed or          maintained by him, and to make grants from the Road Fund          to highway authorities towards the cost of the planting                                                         -          and maintenance of trees or shrubs by the  side of          highways.     (b)   Enabling highway authorities  to incur expenditure  in the          planting and maintenance of trees  or &apos;shrubs by the  side          of highways  constructed  or maintained by them.
                               -2-    .                       Im          Experimental work.      (a)  Enabling the Minister of Transport to incur expenditure          from the Road Fund on experiments connected with the user,          construction, maintenance and Improvement of roads and          bridges.          Considerable attention has been drawn to the question oftree-planting in connection with the new arterial roads, about90 miles in length, which have been under construction duringthe past few years in the neighbourhood of London.   These roadsare in many oases 100 feet or more between fences, though thecarriageway may for the present be restricted to 30 or 40 feet,and a great opportunity presents itself of adding to the amenityof these new highways by the planting of suitable trees.  Unfor*unfortunately, trees have had to be out down for the construction ofthese roads and it seems only fair to posterity that immediate steps should be taken to replace them.          Under the existing law, it is only urban authorities who are empowered to plant trees by the ic&amp;dside, and no such general powers are possessed either by the Minister of Transportor by County Councils.   The proposed Bill would remedy this.          As regards experimental work en roads I need only point to the, fact that highway expenditure in Great Britain now reachea     Wa sum fever  40,000,000 a year, and yet it Is not within the     ftcompetence of the Minister of Transport or of any other authorityto carry out the Investigations and experiments necessary to ensurethat this vast expenditure iB directed to the best advantage.          A few carefully designed experiments and tests, corxrLedout under actual traffic conditions, on different types  of roadmaterials and forms of oonstmotion, and on the effects  on roadsurfaces of different types of vehicles, might In the. end effectfar-reaching economies.   in some  oases  also experiments  with newdesigns  or types of vehicle are required and power to  constructthese should also be included in a bill.                                    (Initialled)&apos;&apos;H.G.83rd May. 1984.
