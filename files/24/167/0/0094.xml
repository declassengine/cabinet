THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY 01? HIS  BRITANNIC MAJESTY &apos;S  GOVERNMENT.!CRBT.P.391 (24).          .   .                  CABINET.                           (Home Affairs Committee).                              PIT HEAD BATHS.               Note by the President of tho Board  of Trade.         I submit to the Home Affairs Committee a Draft Bill  to    make the provision of Pit Head Baths compulsory and an    explanatory Memorandum by the Seoretary for Mine3.         I think it is very desirable that, if possible, this    Bill should be introduced before the Reoess.                                  (Intld.) S.W.Board of Trade,    9th July, 1924.
                                                &apos;    469            Memorandum by the Secretary for Minest     I should be glad if Cabinet approval could be obtained for the introduction of a Bill malclng it oompulsory for everyowner of a coal mine to provide and maintain bathingaccommodation and drying facilities at the pithead (exoeptwhere it is proved not to be reasonable or practicable to doso).     It is universally agreed in principle that it isdesirable that baths should be provided at the pithead, andthat the men should take a bath before leaving their work, and keep their pit clothes in a drying room at the colliery,instead of taking the aooumulated dirt back into their ownhomes.     In this respeot this country ,1s far behind Continentaloountries, Germany. France, and Belgium, all compel mine owners to provide baths.     In the Ooal Mines Act, 1911, a half-hearted attempt was made to provide for bathing accommodation.  Section 77 ofthat Act provides that if, on a ballot, at least two-thirds of those workmen at any mine who are engaged in &quot;dirty&quot;occupations express themselves in favour of baths and dryingrooms&apos;and undertake to pay half oost of maintenance, the mineowner shall forthwith provide such aooommodatlon so long asthe total cost of maintenance (including Interest on capitalexpenditure) does not exoeed 3d. per week for each workmanliable to contribute.     This Seotlon has in effeot been Inoperative for the following reasons: -     (a) Ballots have not been taken, or, where they have,          they havo not shown the neoessary two thirds          majority of the men entitled to vote, owing to the          large number of abstentions.  The reason for this          is that, speaking generally, there has been a          prejudioe against pithead baths.  It is difficult
          to break down this prejudice until the men have had          an opportunity of experiencing the advantages of the          system but among the younger miners and particularly          those who have been in the Army, there is now a          muoh more hopeful field, and it is most important          to take advantage of this opportunity while it          still exists.     (b) Even if a ballot of the men did result in a two          thirds majority in favour of baths being provided,          the proviso that the mine owner need not provide          baths if the estimated oost of maintenance exceeds          3d. per week for each workman has the effect of          releasing every mine owner from his obligations. As          early as 1913 the Departmental Oommittee then          sitting to consider the -drafting of regulations under          Seotion 77, stated that 3d. a week was insufficient          to give the same facilities as were afforded on the          continent, and at the present time, owing to the rise          in costs, 3d. a week would barely cover interest          on capital cost of erection alone.         In oonsequenoe, there are very few pithead baths in          this country, and what there are have been provided,          not under Section 77, but as the result of the          initiative of individual Colliery Companies or by          grants from the Miners&apos; Welfare Fund.  Hor are the          maintenance oharges levied, as the Section provides,          on all the men liable to contribute, but only on the          men voluntarily using the baths.     I think the time ha3 oome when we should at leastbring ourselves into line with Continental countries and tothis end I should like to introduce a Bill requiring evoryowner of a coal mine within a period of three years of thepassing of the Bill to provide sufficient and suitable
bathing aooommodation and drying facilities at the pithead.I should reserve power to exempt any mine where owing to laokof water ot for other reasons it was not reasonably practicable to provide batha or where the ooal seams were likely to be exhausted in a short time.     I should leave it to the owner of the mine to meetthe oapital cost of erecting the baths and the running costs of maintaining them; but I may point out that during theourrency of the present wages agreement the running costs(though not the interest charges on the. oapital expenditure)would In many districts be borne largely by the miners.     Although the mine-owners have announced their adherence to the principle of pithead baths being provided and used,they have told me that they will strongly oppose any Bill onthe above lines for the following reasons:-     (a) the men will not use the baths If they are provided,     (b) the industry oannot stand the cost.     As regards (a) the answer is that the men cannot usebaths if there are no baths for them to usej and it is putting the oart before the horse to say the men must ask for bathswhen most of them do not understand the benefit they arelikely to derive.  Where baths have been provided they are used and the use of them has extended.     As regards costs, BO far as it is possible to form anestimate, the running costs should not amount to more thanId. or l^d. per ton of output,     As regards the oapital cost, thore Is no doubt sometruth In the argument that many mine owners will find itdifficult to raise the neoessary oapital, whioh is likely to amount to something in the region of  10 for each man for whom bathing aooommodation has to be provided.  But thisobieotion is met to some extent by allowing a period ofthree years in which to provide the aooommodation, and I donot feel that it will be general or that it is insurmountable.
  Interest  charges  on  oapital oost  should not  exceed -Id. per ton  of  output.   I also have  hopes  that  by making the present regula-  tions more  elastic it will be  possible to provide  baths at a  lower oapital cost than   10 per head.       When the Bill comes before Parliament,  I anticipate that  amendments  will be moved to effect  three alterations  in the  scope of  the Bill.        (l)  to make  provision of  baths dependent  (as at  present)on            a demand  on the part of  the men at eaoh colliery.        (s)  to enable deductions  to  be made direot from  the wages            of the  workmen to meet  the whole or part of  the cost            of maintenance,        (3)  to make  the taking of baths by the  men oompulBOry.       The  tendency of amendments 1 and 2 would be to revert  to  a modified version  of the existing Section 77.  Pressure  might become so severe as to make it necessary to accept such  amendments  in  order  to secure  the passage of the Bill, but in  that  case I should propose to  stand out for  making provision  compulsory  on  the demand of a  bare  majority  of the men entitled  to  vote,  for excluding any limit  of maintenance costs and for  excluding interest charges from costs of maintenance.        As regards  the  third amendment, I  think it would be quite  unreasonable to  accept it at the  present  time, but if the  House shows strong feeling on  the subject, I think it might  be  praotioable to insert a clause providing  that six  years  after the passing of the Aot  (by  whioh  time  muoh of the  prejudice against bathing might be  expected  to have been  dispelled)  a Resolution  of both Houses  of Parliament  could  authorise the  Seoretary  for Mines to make regulations for  enforcing the  use of the baths by the workmen  before  leaving  the colliery.
