[This  Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty^  Government.]     9 Q C    THE death of Mr. Justice Bray in March and the retirement of Lord Coleridgeon the 12th October, 1923, created two vacancies upon the  Bench of the King&apos;bench Division.  But under the Judicature Act, 1910, neither of those vacanciescould be filled except upon  the  presentation of an Address by both  Houses ofParliament representing that the state of business in the King&apos;s  Bench Divisionrequires it.    The question now arises whether Parliament should be asked to pass such an address and, if so, whether the Address should ask for two Judges or only one.    Upon Mr. Justice Bray&apos;s death the question was considered, and it was then decided in the negative.  The King&apos;s Bench Division, at the time (June 1920) when mr. Justice Swift and Mr. Justice  Acton were added to  its numbers, had to face a volume of work which was unprecedented in quantity.  In spite of the efforts ofthe Bench  thus strengthened, arrears  continued to grow, and  it  was  foundnecessary upon  the occurrence of the next vacancy again to  ask Parliament topass a resolution, and Mr. Justice  Branson was appointed.  By these and other measures the  arrears were attacked and cleared off.    There was in the spring of 1923 a decline in the number of cases standing for trial, though there was even then some indication that this decline might prove tobe only temporary.    Experience  since that date has verified the anticipation of a renewed increasein the amount of work to be performed by the Division.   The number of actionsset down for trial at the  beginning of the present Easter  Term is almost equal tothat of 1920, and more than double that of 1923 (1920, 888;  1923, 380;  1924, 861),and the number of proceedings commenced in the King&apos;s Bench Division up to thebeginning of the Sittings was 17,753 this year as against 15,780 in 1923.   If thefigures are  looked at not relatively but as they stand, they are sufficient to causesome  anxiety  as  to whether the cases can be disposed of by the present judicialstaff without leaving arrears.    On a more general survey there are strong reasons for keeping the number of judges up to the limit allowed by the Act of 1910 :-    1. The  divorce  work,  though fortunately somewhat less than in the years immediately following the  Armistice, remains  heavy and  shows an increase from1923.  On the 1st June, 1923, 594 divorce cases were pending.  The number onthe 1st June,  1924, was 686;  620 cases stood for trial at the beginning of EasterSittings 1923; 700 at the beginning of Easter Sittings this year. (  But the  list isheavier in comparison than it appears, for at the beginning of  Trinity .1923 therewere  set down  .11  special juries  (2 i of which remained  undisposed  of  at theend of the Sittings).  This  year  there are  18 special juries  set down.   Thenumber  of  undefended  causes set down has  risen from 327  to 380.  But,  inaddition, the Admiralty work in  the  Division shows a very substantial increase.The Admiralty  list  cannot be analysed beforehand with such accuracy as  the divorce list can, because actions are appointed for trial on a  particular day to suitthe movements  of  ships and witnesses.  But  Mr.  Justice Hill estimates thatthere will be more than enough Admiralty to keep him very fully engaged duringPrinted for the Cabinet.

the whole of Trinity Sittings, and  that  he will  not during that time be able togive assistance in Divorce.    It has again and again been necessary to lend a King&apos;s Bench Judge to the divorce Court, even when both the  Judges of the Division were available either forAdmiralty or for Divorce.  But&quot; the President of the  Division is now disabled byillness from sitting, and  even  if the Kings Bench Division lends a Judge, as isproposed, during the whole of the  Sittings, the needs  of the Division will not be fully met.    I  see no  prospect that the Probate, Divorce and Admiralty Division will beable to dispense with assistance from the King&apos;s Bench Division if it is to give a reasonably speedy  trial in divorce  cases and to deal punctually with Admiraltycases.   The King&apos;s Bench Division  now habitually gives help to the ProbateDivision in two ways, namely:     (a.)  In town, by lending a Judge or Judges to deal with divorce and Admiralty -          work at  the Royal Courts of Justice, and    (6.)  By the King&apos;s Bench Judges themselves disposing of  divorce cases on          Circuit.    The trial  of divorce cases  on Circuit only began in October  1922.   The cases to be tried on Circuit are at present limited to undefended cases and Poor Persons&apos;cases, whether defended or not, and  the number of towns at which divorce businessmay be taken is at present limited  to  ten.  But so far the work has  proceededsmoothly, and there is considerable and growing demand which I anticipate itwill be necessary to meet-for  the  enlargement  both  of the class of cases to be heard  and of the number of towns at which they may be tried.  Further, it  is tobe  anticipated that the number of cases will increase as the  country solicitorsbecome more accaistomed, to the practice.    The King&apos;s Bench Judges, therefore, are detained a longer time on Circuit byreason of these cases, and as time goes on the period for which they are so detainedwill increase materially.    2. It has  only been possible to dispose of the heavy arrears in  the King&apos;s bench division because by War legislation the right  to  a trial by jury in civil cases is largely cut down.   That right has to some extent been restored, and it is proposedto restore it by the  Administration  of Justice Bill, which is now before Parliament,to the exact position in which it was before the passing of the  Juries Act,  1918.The effect of  the  partial restoration which has  already taken place  has  been considerably to increase the number of cases in which resort is had to trial byjury.   Excluding commercial causes  and actions for trial under Order XIV, of thecases set down for trial at the commencement of the Easter Sittings 1922, only one in every forty were jury actions, while at Easter of, this year nearly one-half weremarked to be tried  by a jury, and at  the  end of those Sittings  there are no lessthan  364 recorded for  trial by jury  as against 51 at the beginning of  TrinitySittings 1923 ; 82 at the beginning  of Trinity Sittings  1922 ; 42 at the beginning ofTrinity  Sittings 1921, and 15 at the beginning of Trinity Sittings  1920.  It isnotorious that the  trial of a cause with  a jury takes&apos; on an average at least twiceas long as a trial by a Judge alone.   It was for this reason, amongst others, thatthe legislation restricting the right was retained in force until the arrears had been cleared off.  But if, now that the arrears have been cleared off and jury trial has again  become popular, the judicial  strength is allowed to fall, the result must he afresh accumulation of arrears.    3. Nothing could be more uneconomical than  to allow arrears to accumulateonce more.  The existence of arrears is in itself a denial of justice, but, in addition,it has the immediate effect of reducing largely the revenue of the  Court.  If speedytrial cannot be obtained in the Courts, litigants will have recourse to arbitration,and when business has once been lost, experience shows that it is extremely difficultto bring it back again.  Meanwhile, the  main expense of the Courts goes on at thesame figure.  The  building itself cannot be reduced  in size or  devoted to  other purposes.   Trained clerks cannot be improvised  at  a momenfs notice.   Thestanding charges thus remain  the same, while  the revenue which they earn fallsoff.  The cost of  a Judge is limited to the  amount of his salary and that of hisclerk, a total  of  5,400 a year less tax-a very small percentage upon the totalturnover.     4. One of the expedients resorted to in order to deal with arrears has been theappointment  of Commissioners to take the place of  Judges on Assize and thus set
 them free for work in London.   This expedient  is very unpopular in the country. Litigants on Circuit consider, with some justice, that they are entitled to the services of what they call a &quot; red Judge.&quot;  And the practice works unevenly in  different parts of the country.  In Lancashire and Yorkshire, where the whole of the heaviest class of case  comes to be tried on Circuit, and where also are the heaviest lists of criminal matters, there is special dissatisfaction.   By immemorial custom, which it is impossible to ignore, the Judges choose their Circuits in order of seniority.  The Northern and North-Eastern Circuits, which involve the longest continuous absence from London and which comprise the less agreeable places of residence, are there- fore left  for the junior Judge, or, where a Commissioner is sent, for the Commis- petitioner.   These Circuits,  therefore, which are the  most important as regards the volume of work, have again and again to content themselves with the visit  of a Commissioner instead of a Judge.     In considering the cost of now appointing an additional Judge, there must be set  off  against the gross figure of . 5,400  mentioned  above, the cost of the Commissioner who will necessarily be employed if  such a Judge is not  appointed. In the financial year 1922-23, Jl,242 was spent on fees to Commissioners, and in the financial year 1923-24,  3,102 was spent on the same object.     5. The autumn and winter are the critical periods of  the legal year.   During that time the Courts not only feel the effect of the work which the solicitors have been able to prepare for trial since the end of the Trinity Term, but are depleted by the absence of most of the judicial staff on Circuit.  There are periods during these months when not more  than two Judges  of the King&apos;s Bench Division are available for work in London, and any accident, such as the temporary illness of a Judge, or an  unexpected rush  of work on Circuit, or a lengthy trial  at the Old Bailey, may leave the Royal Courts of Justice without more than one King&apos;s Bench Judge, to the great inconvenience of the public.     6. The work of  the  Railway and Canal Commission is at present  unusually heavy.  By Statute a King&apos;s Bench Judge assigned for the purpose is Chairman of that Commission.  Great difficulty has been found during the past year by the King&apos;s Bench Judge occupying that position in finding enough time for  his duties.     7. The judicial staff at present can only get through its work by accumulating substantial arrears, even if all  the  members of the  Judicial Bench are  always available for their duties.  But,  as already observed, the President of the Probate Division  is ill,  and it is improbable that he will be available again until after the Long Vacation, when abnormal  arrears may be  expected to  have accrued in his Division.  Mr. Justice Salter is also  seriously ill, and it is uncertain when he will return to duty;  and there  is  a growing disposition  to  utilise  the services of Judges for extra-judicial work.  At  the  moment  Mr.  Justice Talbot is engaged upon the Syme enquiry, Mr. Justice  Swift is needed  from time to time  on the Aliens Committee, and  there  is a  prospect of  other   demands  being made. Furthermore, Mr. Justice Astbury, of the Chancery Division, is ill, but no Judge can be lent from the KingV Bench  Division to  take  his  place because no one is available, and  there must have  been a breakdown in  that Division but for the voluntary offer of service made by Lord Buckmaster.    8. The Lord Chief Justice, upon  whom rests the duty of  the management ofthe King&apos;s Bench work, has expressed to me in the strongest terms his  view  thatthe circumstances are such as  not  only to  justify an application to Parliament,but to render that course a plain duty.  But there is, in addition, a strong feeling among the King&apos;s Bench Judges generally whose knowledge and experience arevaluable in these matters in favour of again  raising the judicial  staff  to its fullnumber.    For  these  reasons, I  suggest to my colleagues that an Address  should be moved in both  Houses,  under  the  Act of 1910, for the appointment  of  two additional Judges in the King&apos;s Bench Division.  I do not anticipate any serious opposition in the House of Lords; it is probable  that, in the House of Commons,the motion will have the support of the ex-Law Officers.    I attach an Appendix giving the history of the matter.                                                                 H. OF C.    House of Lords, June 25, 1924.[116741
    BEFORE the reign of  Richard III the numbers of the Judges of each of the three Courts of Common Law varied from time to time, and there was no attemptto maintain an equality of numbers in each Court.    Under Richard III         The Court of King&apos;s Bench had one Chief Justice and two puisnes.        The Common Pleas had one Chief Justice and three puisnes.        The Court of Exchequer had one Chief Baron and three puisnes.    Henry VII added an additional Judge to the Common Pleas and Henry VIIImaintained these numbers.   Under Edward VI, Mary and Elizabeth each Courthad one President and three puisnes.    James I added one  puisne each to the King&apos;s Bench and the Common Pleas,but he reduced  the  King&apos;s  Bench again  to four, and Charles I made a similarreduction  in the Common Pleas.    Thus in the latter reign the establishment was fixed  at one President andthree puisnes  for each Court, and  these numbers continued until 1830, when, by11 Geo. IV and 1 Wm. IV, cap.  70 (the  Law  Terms  Act,  1830), an  additionalJudge was appointed to each Court, making a total in each Court of one president and four puisnes.    In  1868 the Parliamentary  Elections  Act,  1868  (31  &amp; 32 Viet., cap. 125),transferred  the trial of election petitions  from  the House  of Commons to the judges of  the Courts  of Common Law, and, by section 11 (8) and section  55,authorised the appointment  of an additional Judge to each of  the three Courts.    Accordingly,  upon the  25th  August,  1868, Hayes, Brett  and Cleasby were appointed  respectively  to   the  Courts of  King&apos;s  Bench,  Common Pleas  andExchequer, making the strength of each Court one President and five  puisnes.    The next  alteration in the number of the  Judges of the Courts of common law  followed  upon the&quot; operation  of  the Judicature Acts  of 1873 and 1875 andof the Appellate Jurisdiction Act,  1876.   The Acts of 1873 (except sections  20,21 and 55, which relate  to the Court  of Appeal proposed to  be constituted underthe Act of 1873 and to appeals to it and  to the House of Lords) and 1875 came into operation together on the 1st November, 1875.  Sections 20, 21 and 55 of theAct of 1873, so far as they came  into operation at  all, did so  together with the appellate  Jurisdiction Act, 1876, on the 1st November, 1876.    As the Act of 1875  amended  the  Act  of 1873 before the latter had come intooperation, and the Act of 1876 amended both those  Acts before the appeal sectionof the former had come into operation, it  is difficult to  state concisely what their effect (so far as material to the  present matter) was.  It may perhaps best besummarised as follows :     The Act of 1873 contemplated that the permanent establishment of the HighCourt should be twenty-one Judges,  that  is to say, four  Chancery Judges (oneMaster of  the  Rolls  and three Vice-Chancellors),  two Judges of the  Probate,Divorce and Admiralty Division, and fifteen Judges  of  the  Common  Law Courts(Lord Chief Justice of England, Lord Chief  Justice of the Common Pleas, lord chief Baron and twelve puisnes - four in each Division with a power by Order inCouncil to reduce the number of Divisions  of  the High Court and abolish the offices of Chief Justice, Master of  the  Rolls, Chief Justice of the Common Pleasand Chief Baron of the Exchequer).*    This  involves the reduction  of the  Common Law  Judges (Presidents  andpuisnes taken together) from eighteen to fifteen ; and section 5 of the Act of 1873accordingly provided again  in somewhat obscure words that new appointmentsshould not  be made until  the number of the Common Law  puisnes had been   * The words used (see section 32 of the Act of 1873) are so obscure as to be almost incomprehensible.The intention no dnubt was t.o give power to  merge the Common Law Courts all together and to haveonlyone Chief Justice instead of two Chief Justices and one Lord Chief Baron, but not, so far as this section isconcerned, to reduce the number of Judges.  It  may be that the extreme partisans of fusion contemplatedeventually a  High Court in which there would not be any Divisions at all.
9 9*7h (J 8reduced below twelve.  Before this provision for reduction  came into operationsection 3 of the Act of 1875 supervened.  That section, after reciting the provisionsof section 5 of the Act of 1873, recited that, &quot; having regard to the state of business in the  several Courts . . . . , it  is  expedient that the number of Judges thereofshould  not at present be reduced,&quot; and repealed the provision.    Thus, when the Act of 1875 came into  operation, there were in office eighteenCommon Law Judges ii.c, two Lord Chief Justices  and one Lord Chief Baron,and five puisnes in each Division).    The Act of 1875 made fundamental alterations in the arrangements for appeals from the High  Court proposed by the  Act of 1873.   The earlier Statute (see section  6) had contemplated a  Court of Appeal comprising besides the LordChancellor, the Lord Chief Justice of England, the Master of the Rolls, the chief justice of the Common Pleas, and Chief Baron of the Exchequer (who were to beex-officios)  &quot;so many ordinary Judges (not exceeding nine  at  any one  time) asHer Majesty shall from time to time appoint.&quot;  The first ordinary Judges were tobe the then existing Lord Justices of Appeal in Chancery (James and Mellish), the then existing salaried Judges of the Judicial  Committee  appointed under theJudicial Committee Act, 1871 (34 &amp; 35 Viet. cap.  91), who were four in number,*and such three other persons as Her Majesty may be pleased to appoint by letters patent.&quot; The Court of Appeal thus constituted  was to  exercise, in  place of theHouse of Lords, the jurisdiction of that House in appeals from England.    The Act of 1875, on the other hand, left the jurisdiction of the House of Lordsas an appellate Court where  it was  before the Act of  1873 passed.   It  constitutedthe Court of Appeal as  a Court intermediate between the  High Court and theHouse  of Lords.  It was to consist of the five  ex-officios  mentioned above andthree ordinary Judges, who were to be the  two Lord Justices of Appeal in Chancery.and &quot; such one other person as Her Majesty may be pleased to appoint by letters patent.&quot;  Sir Richard Baggallay,  then  Solicitor-General, was  appointed  to theCourt of Appeal under this power.    The Appellate Jurisdiction Act, 1876 (39 &amp; 40 Viet., cap. 59), authorised theappointment  of three more  &quot;ordinary Judges of the Court of Appeal,&quot;  and itdirected that the  first three appointments were to be made by the transfer to theCourt of Appeal of three  Judges of the  High Court, and that the vacancies socreated  in the High Court &quot; shall not be filled up except in the event and to theextent  hereinafter mentioned&quot; (see  section 15).  The Judges so transferred wereto he taken from the three  Common Law Divisions, from amongst  Judges whohad held office for not less than two  years, and the Judges so transferred were laidunder an obligation to go Circuit in the  same manner as if they were Judges ofthe High Court.    In execution of this power, Bramwell B., from the Exchequer, Brett J., fromthe Common Pleas, and Amphlett B., from the Exchequer, were  transferred to theCourt of Appeal.  The  condition imposed by  section 15 upon the filling  up ofthe vacancies so created is described later in  this memorandum.  It is enough tosay here that it was not fulfilled  immediately, and  accordingly the vacanciescreated by these appointments to the Court of Appeal were not  filled up.   At thesame time,  however, another vacancy was created in the King&apos;s Bench  Division bythe appointment  of Mr. Justice  Blackburn to be a  Lord of Appeal in  Ordinaryunder the Act of 1876.  Hawkins was appointed to the King&apos;s Bench  Division inBlackburn&apos;s place and immediately transferred to the  Exchequer  Division,  his place  in the  King&apos;s  Bench  Division  being  left unfilled.   The  vacancy  in  theCommon Pleas and the other vacancy in the Exchequer Division were left unfilled.Thus the Common Law Judges were reduced in number to fifteen (three Presidentsand twelve puisnes), but three of the Lords Justices remained liable to performsome of the  duties which would naturally fall upon  the Judges  of the  HighCourt.    In practice it was found that the obligation to go Circuit resting upon three off the Judges of  the Court of Appeal could not be fulfilled without dislocating thearrangements  of that Court.  The result is that the number of Judges availableto perform the ordinary work of the Common Law Courts has remained ever sincebelow that  contemplated as necessary in 1876.  As will appear hereafter, measures have from  time  to time  been taken to increase the judicial strength, but these were rendered necessary in each case by the then state of business on the common law side.         * Sir Barnes Peacock, Sir Montague Smith, Sir Robert Collier, Sir James Colvile.
     In the autumn  of  1880,  Cockburn,  Lord.  Chief  Justice  of  England,  andKelly C.B. died, and advantage was taken of the vacancies thereby created to take action under section  32  of the Act of 1873.  On the 16th December, 1880, by anOrder  in  Council  which came into  operation on  the  26th February,  1881, theCommon  Pleas and  Exchequer  Divisions were  united in  the  King&apos;s bench division, and the offices of Chief Justice of the Common Pleas and Chief Baronwere abolished.   Coleridge,   then  Chief  Justice of  the  Common Pleas, wasappointed  Lord Chief Justice of England, and two puisnes were  appointed inthe place of the two Presidents.  The number of  Common Law Judges, therefore,was still fifteen, namely, the Lord Chief Justice and fourteen puisnes.     The &quot; event&quot;  and &quot; extent&quot; to be &quot; hereinafter mentioned,&quot; as indicated insection 15 of the Act of 1876, are described in  section 18  of that Act, which is asfollows:         &quot; Whenever any two of the said paid Judges of the Judicial Committee of     the Privy Council have died or resigned, Her  Majesty may, upon an  address     from both  Houses of Parliament representing that the state of business in     the High  Court  of  Justice is  such as to require the appointment of an     additional  Judge, fill up one of the vacancies  created by the transfer herein-     before  authorised by appointing one new Judge of the said High Court in any     Division thereof;  and, on the death or retirement of  the remaining two paid    Judges of  the  said Judicial  Committee, Her Majesty may,  upon  the like    address, fill up in like manner another of the said vacancies, and from time to    time fill up any vacancies occurring in  the offices of  Judges so appointed.&quot;    Sir James Colvile died on the 6th December, 1880, and Sir Robert  Collier onthe 27th October, 1886, and thereby a power arose to make an appointment undersection 18, if  such an address as that section contemplated were  passed.   Nosuch action, however, was taken.  Sir  Barnes Peacock died on the 3rd December,1890, and  Sir Montague Smith on  the 3rd May, 1891.  But it was not until 1899that any  action was  taken under the section.    In that  year Farwell J. wasappointed to the  Chancery Division.   In  1907 Coleridge was appointed to theKing&apos;s  Bench  Division, also  under that section, and the number of the King&apos;bench  Division thereupon  became sixteen one  Lord  Chief Justice and fifteenpuisnes.    In 1910, the  Supreme Court of Judicature  Act,  1910 (10 Edw. VII and1 Geo. V), authorised the appointment of two additional  Judges of  the HighCourt.   These Judges were to be attached to the King&apos;s Bench Division, but itwas  provided that, whenever  after the 1st August, 1911, the number of puisneJudges of  the Division amounted to fifteen or more, a vacancy should not be filledup except upon the presentation of an address from  both Houses &quot; representingthat the state of business in the King&apos;s Bench Division requires that such vacancyshould be filled.&quot;     The Act came  into operation on the 26th July,  1910.     Walton J. died on the 25th September, 1910, and Jelf J. resigned before theend of the Vacation.  To fill these vacancies, and  in execution of the Act of 1910,Bankes, Avory, Horridge and Lush  JJ.  were  appointed Bankes  to  Walton&apos;svacancy, Lush  to Jelfs vacancy, and Avory and Horridge  to the two new Judge-ships.  The number of puisnes thus became seventeen.     Grantharn J. died on the 30th November, 1911, and no appointment was madein his place, the number being thus reduced to sixteen.     Lawrance J. resigned in March 1912, and no  new appointment was made inhis place, the number being thus reduced to fifteen.     Hamilton J. was appointed to the Court of Appeal on the 1st October, 1912,and  Rowlatt was appointed in his place, retaining the number at fifteen.     On the 1st November, 1912, an address having been presented under the act of 1910, Bailhache was appointed, bringing the number to  16.     On the 30th  May, 1913, an address having been  presented under the Act  of1910, Atkin was appointed, bringing the number to 17.     On the 21st October, 1913, Phillimore J. was appointed to the Court of Appeal,and  no new appointment  was made  in  his place,  the number being therebyreduced to  sixteen.     In February 1914, Buoknill J.  resigned, and no new  appointment was made inhis place, the number being thereby reduced to fifteen.     On the 23rd April, 1914, Channell J. resigned and Pickford J. was promoted&apos;to
the Court  of Appeal Shearman  and Sankey  being appointed in their places andthe number being retained at fifteen.    On the 13th January, 1915, Bankes J. was appointed to the Court of Appeal,and Low was appointed in his place, the number being retained at fifteen.    On the 12th October, 1916, Scrutton J. was appointed to the Court of Appeal,and McCardie was appointed in his place, the number being retained at fifteen.    On the 11th October, 1917, Low J.  died  and Salter J. was  appointed in his place, the number being retained at fifteen.    On the 12th October, 1917, Ridley J. resigned and Roche was  appointed in his place, the number being retained at fifteen.    On the 8th March, 1919, Atkin J. was  appointed to the Court  of Appeal andGreer was appointed in his place,  the number being retained at fifteen.    On the 22nd June, 1920, an  address having been presented under the Act of1910,  Swift  and Acton  were appointed,  the number being thereby  raised  toseventeen.    On the 15th April, 1921, A. T. Lawrence J. having  been appointed Lord chief justice of England in the place  of Lord Reading L.C.J., and an address havingbeen presented under  the Act of 1910, Branson  was  appointed,  retaining  thenumber at seventeen.    On the 27th March, 1923, Bray J. died, and no  appointment was made in hisroom, the number being thereby reduced to sixteen.    On the 12th October, 1923, Coleridge J. resigned, and the number was therebyreduced to fifteen.    On the 13th November, 1923, Darling J. resigned and  Talbot was appointed,the number being retained at fifteen, at which it stands at present.Before Richard III  ...Bichard III  ......Henry VII   ......Henry VII to ElizabethJames ICharles I    .........Until-  Law Terms Act, 1830Until-  Parliamentary Elections Act,    1868......Until-  Appellate Jurisdiction  Act,    1876    ...   ......Until-  26th February, 1881Until-  12th October, 1907......Until-  Judicature Act, 1910Until-  30th November, 1911Until-  March 1912......Until-  1st November,  1912COMMON  LAW JUDGES.
