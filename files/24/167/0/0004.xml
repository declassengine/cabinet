;S DOOUiiEKT  IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANMIO &apos;MAJESTY&apos;S OOVERNKMT.jET^           HOURS  OP  INDUSTRIAL  EMPLOYMENT  BILL.              MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER OF LABOUR.?A)       The proposal to introduce a Bill which would enable the   Government to ratify tho Washington Hours Convention oamo boforo   the Home Affairs Committoe early in the lifo of the present   Government in conneotion with the priority to bo accorded to various   Government Bills, and the introduction of such a Bill was approved   in prinoiple by tho Cabinet whon the list of Government Bills waa   reviowod.  On the 14th February I stated in anowcr to a question in   the House that it was the Government1s intention to ratify the   Convention and to introduce a Biil for that purpose, and.I have   repeated that statement on several oooasionB sinoo that date.  The   Bill was circulated to the Cabinet and to the Government Departments   oonoornod at the end of March and was oonsiderod by the Homo Affairs   Oommittoo on the  4th April.  At that meeting, in viow of certain   difficulties which had beon raised with regard to tho working of   Governmont industrial establishments undor the Bill and in view of   representations rooelvod by the Ministry of Transport as to its effect   on tho railways it was decided that I should confer with the Minister   of Transport and the Financial Secretary to the Treasury to seo how   far these difficulties oould be overcome.  The Cabinot on tho 7th   April docidod to postpone consideration of the Bill until after this   conferonco.                    V   3.   At  the conferonoe which took place on the Snd May, the   difficulties apprShendod by various Departments were considered and   also the position due to tho agreements now in force between the   railway  companies and railway unions.   it was decided that during   the following weok tho Minister of Transport should oxplain the   position to the Railway and Dock intorosts and the Treasury should   consider whether, whilo maintaining the possibility of ratification,   any amendments oould bo made to the Bill whioh would be of assistance
                                                                 soto Government establishments, and that I should subsequently be free to bring the matter again before the Cabinet,5. .  So far as Railways are ooncerned, I understand from theMinister of Transport (see oopy of memo, attached) that athis interviews with the Companies thoy made it plain that theyare opposed to the Bill because (apart from the questions of(a) the inoreased cost and (b) the effect upon their agreements with the Unions) they do not think it is practicable - withinthe limits of the Convention - to apply the provisions of theBill to the Railway Service.   In my opinion, however, theCompanies have not sufficiently taken into account the wide powers to make regulations which the Convention contemplated andwhich the Bill provides. &apos;4.   As regards the Railwayman&apos;s Unions they informed theMinister of Transport (as they had already informed me) thatthey were opposed to the Bill because it would put an end totheir present practice of working what is practically a regular week of 48 hours, plu3 overtime, plus (fairly regularly)Sunday work.5.   in my opinion the olaim of the Railway Companies and of theUnions to remain outside the Convention ought not to beadmitted;   and I suggest that we should proceed with theBill, leaving those interests to put their case forward in theHouse of Commons,6.   As regards the Docks, I understand from tho Minister ofTransport-that the men&apos;s loaders are in favour of the Bill but the dock Authorities are against it.         I propose that
that in this case too, we should leave it to tho DockAuthorities to justify their opposition In the House ofCommons.7.   So far as tho Government Departments are concernsdI havo received no further memorandum from the Treasurywho have, I understand, been in touch with other Departments,including tho Service Departments.   I understand, however,that the Service Departments desire an opportunity of ox-pressing their views as to the position of their industrial establishments&apos;and that, so soon as this memorandum hasbeen circulated, they will prepare and issuo any statement which they consider It necessary to lay before tho Cabinet.8.   CopieB of the Bill have been sent to the Law officersand the Lord Advocate.9&apos;   In my view the Government is pledged to the introduc-tion of a Bill to deal with the Washington Hours Convention-.Under this Bill arrangomonto can be made which will giveelasticity in daily working hours, provided always thatthe Weekly average calculated over a period does not excood48.   There is also provision for longer hours to be worked in oontinuous processes in cases of accident, breakdown,or &quot;force majeuro&quot;, in accosBory or intermittent work andin exceptional cases of prossure of work. 10.  If any tradee wish to maintain a longer working week, taking the average over the year, they ought, in my  judgment, to put thoir case.publicly in order that thero may bo no doubt as  to tho extent of tho opposition and the grounds on which  it ic based. 11.  As regards Government Departments, I havo already pointed out that  there is power in the Bill to sanotion any  arrangement of hours  that loaves  the 48 hour principle
unimpaired, and I fail to see how this Governmentcould defend, a olaim to violate that principle in anyof the establishments under its own control.12.  There is further the international aspect to beoonsldored.   I do not think I need labour  the point that foreign countries will rogard our attitude in thismatter as an acid test of our sincerity in  that sphereand of our goodwill towards the International LabourOrganisation.13.  The Government and the party are fully pledged to this proposal.   The introduction of a Bill on those lines has for a long time bean declared to be theGovernment&apos;8 intention and I strongly urge  the Cabinetto give me permission to introduce the Bill withoutdelav.

/considered,                Memorandum by the Minister of Transport.Minister of Labour.     As  arranged with you I have discussed with representatives ofemployers and employed in the Railway and Dock Industries the effectof the application to railways and to docks&apos; of the provisions of theWashington Draft Convention with regard to hours of labour,     (l) Railways.  I explained, to the representatives both of theUnions and of the Companies that I \mderstood your position to be thatyou would consider in the most sympathetic spirit, in order to meet thespecial  circumstances of the railways, any agreed proposals so long asthe principle that an &apos;average of 48 hours a week was  maintained.  Bothsides stated that, in view of the necessity for running railwayscontinuously and the uncertainty due to delays in train working, intheir opinion no proposals could be framed which adhered  strictlyto this  principle.  They pointed out that even in those cases wherethe provision of an elaborate system of relief might enable this to bedone the change of basis from a 48-hour week in six days  to a 48-hour week in seven days would mean a complete re-drafting of the existing agreements and,a loss of income to individual men, together with agreat increase of cost to the Companies.   Ths Unions stated that their objection^ to the seven days week were not merely the loss of overtimepay but the fact that the necessary re-organisation of train men&apos;sshifts would throw them back to the bad systems of working which havebeen largely mitigated during recent years,   So strongly did they feelon this that they expressed the opinion that, quite apart from any questions  of pay, the alterations in conditions involved would meansuch serious dissatisfaction as to make stoppages probable,     Both  Companies and men agreed that the extended use of reliefwen which  would be required in signal boxes and among the permanentway gangs  was unsatisfactory, particularly when public safety was
considered,   The Companies pointed out that even ifagreements are reached with the men for a 48-hour weekbased on seven days, great extra expense would be involvedbecause the number of extra men required must oost considerably more than the amount of overtime at present paid,   In otherconnections, the Railway Companies1 view is understood to bethat the present railway rates will not bear any seriousincreased expenditure,   It would appear therefore that thepresent Bill may cause disputes on the railways and might require a revision ,of rates since the Companies are entitledto demand that rates shall be raised in order that they mayearn their standard revenue.     I fully appreciate, however, that in your opinionno objections however cogent based on financial considera-tions or the disturbance of existing agreements are in themselves sufficient to outweigh the advantages tothe Government in fulfilling by the introduction of a bill the pledges given at Washington.   The real difficulty,however, in applying the provisions of the draft Bill orthe principles of the Convention to the railways is notthe trouble with the public if railway rates have again to be raised, or the trouble with the railway workers ifthe agreements have to be revised, but the difficulty of defending the introduction of a Government Bill which,if passed, must result from time to time in stoppages ofrailway transport or in breaches of the law,   On theevidence before me I am satisfied that this will be theposition.   It must be realised that if in any particular area, e,g, a mineral area, the pressure cf traffic is, asoften is the case, exceptionally heavy for,a week or more on                                                /end,
end, practically the whole staff in that area must workovertime to keep the trains moving.   To attempt to remedy this by averaging out later would mean that the congestion would recur, and the provision of a duplicatestaff to meet those inevitable and incalculable pressuresof traffic is impracticable,,   Similarly, if a late trainis delayed, it follows that not only the train staffbut the whole of the stations staffs at the stationsconcerned must Y?ork overtime in order to clear it,,   Ifthey have to save this out of a later week&apos;s working,quite disproportionate extra staffs must be provided0(2)   Docvst,  As regards Docks, the employers pointed outthat the principle of a 44-hour week is already applicableto the greater-part of port labour, and they consider that having regard to the special nature of work at docks,which is subject to inevitable fluctuations, dependingupon tidal conditions and weather, and the uncertainty inthe arrival of ships, and the volume of traffic, it wouldnot be possible to carry on the work at ports efficientlyunless overtiiiie working were permitted and that no systemof averaging hours of work would permit of the necessaryelasticity.   They also pointed out that in so far as arigid limitation of hours of work could be brought intoforce by an alteration in existing methods, any suchalteration would., in many cases, involve a very large increase in the expense of working the port.   This expensewould not fall upon the Dock Authorities themselves who, inmost cases, are Public Authorities charging dues sufficientto  cover their expenditure, but on the consumer                                                 /or
or the industries of the country, and tho effect ofsuch increased cost of working might have mostaerious consequences on trade and industry.     Theas views are not, however, shared by theTransport and General Workers&apos; Union.   Kr.Bevin ontheir behalf states that he considered that it wouldbe possible so to reorganise the method of working at ports as to make It possible to apply the Convention.     I cannot therefore agree that the impracticabilityof giving effect to the provisions of the draft Bill isabsolute in the case of docks as it is in the case of railways, no condrete arguments having been adducedby the employers.   I would, however, remind mycolleagues that somewhat serious complaints haverecently been made by foreign shipowners of the expenseentailed in handling traffic at British docks, and anyre-orgonisation of dock labour, if it is not to Incurexpense, must take a considerable time,     I think it Is right to warn my colleagues .thatthose responsible for working both the railways and the docks in the country are definitely of the opinion tfcrtany attempt to apply the provisions of the i/ashingtonConvention to railway and dock employment would make itimpossible for railways and docks to be carried onsatisfactorily.
