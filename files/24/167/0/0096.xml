[JMlJJgg&quot;-^&quot;1  is tne  Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.].                        tainted for the Cabinet.SECRET.CP. 393 (24).                                CABINET.SALE OP AIRCRAFT  TO THE PERSIAN GOVERNMENT.              MEMORANDUM BY THE  SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR.    I CIRCULATE herewith, for the information of my colleagues, a  note by&apos; theAir Staff on the supply of aircraft to Persia.    It will  be  seen that the Persian  Government  have  recently  purchased anumber of German and French machines (the former through Russian sources),which have apparently failed to give satisfaction;  as a result Reza Khan (thePersian Prime Minister  and Minister for War) has requested to be allowed topurchase British machines.    The Air Staff are in favour of granting this request and propose that in  thefirst instance  an Air Force officer should proceed to Tehran to advise the PersianGovernment as to the types of machine most suitable for use in Persia.    The Foreign  Office concur in this course of action, but have asked that thematter may be referred to the Cabinet, and I shall be glad to learn my colleagues&apos;views, since I regard the question as one of general foreign, rather than purely air,policy.    It is clear that, if the aircraft which the Persian Government require are  notsupplied from British sources, they will be obtained elsewhere very probably fromRussia and in these circumstances I recommend making supply, provided anytransactions are carried out on a cash basis.    Such action is not, I think, in any way inconsistent with the decision takenby the Cabinet on the 15th April (Cabinet 27 (24), Conclusion 5) that the disposalof Government-owned arms and munitions of war to foreign States should not infuture be sanctioned, since I read that decision as referring to surplus stocks only.                                                            T.,                                                 Secretary of State for Air.    Air Ministry, July 10,  1924.         NOTE BY THE AIR STAFF ON SUPPLY OF AIRCRAFT TO PERSIA.    THE present  Persian  Government  has  lately  shown  considerable interestin aviation.  It will be remembered that Reza Khan combines the office of PrimeMinister with tbat of Minister for War, and he is applying a considerable part ofhis exceptional energies  and abilities to improving the administration  of themilitary forces of the country.   He  is himself a soldier by profession, who has risen from the ranks to his  present dominating position in Persia.    2.  The  Persian  Government  recently  bought   seven  Junker  (German)machines through Russian  sources also  six French  machines,  and have intheir employ  a  few mechanics  of German and  of French nationality to look after them.    3.  No information is at hand  as to the  condition of the Junker machines,but the French machines have given poor  results, and  Reza Khan,  in a  recentinterview with the British Military Attache, expressed  strong  dissatisfaction, and added the hope that he would be allowed to buy British machines through RoyalAir Force Headquarters at Baghdad.      [11813]
    4. The&apos; Air Force suggest that the Persian Government should be informed tothe following effect :-    (a.)  His Majesty&apos;s Government will be prepared to advise the Persian Govern-           ment in regard to the types of aircraft suitable, and as to the nature of           the organisation necessary to maintain  them.   For this purpose they           would be ready to send a responsible officer from the Air Headquarters           at Baghdad to visit Tehran.    (&amp;&apos;.)  The first necessity  is the provision of efficient mechanics.  Unless  and           until there is an adequate  ground staff rapid deterioration  and failure           of any machines they buy is inevitable.    (c.)  They should begin with training machines only, which  are cheaper to  buy           and to maintain  and could be used to some extent as war aircraft.    (d.)  Aircraft (and spares) cannot  be supplied from Royal Air Force depots in           Iraq, but would have to be supplied from  England.    (e.)  Any material supplied must be paid for cash down.    5. It is in the view of the Air Staff improbable that the Persians will succeedunder  any  conditions  in  forming an efficient native air service.   The  above proposals are, however, based on the assumption that there is no way of preventing the Persians from buying aeroplanes, and that it is therefore preferable that theyshould be  supplied  from Great Britain rather than from any other country,  andunder conditions in which any subsequent failure will  be  clearly attributable tothe defective capacities  of the Persians themselves and not to misrepresentationor  lack  of  sound  advice  as to  the  requisite  conditions for the  maintenanceof aircraft.    6. It is not proposed to mention the possibility of Persian officers or mechanicsbeing received for training in British air establishments, as  it is believed that  thissuggestion would at present be regarded by the Persians as an  attempt at  foreigndomination.  If at some future time the proposal were originated by the Persiansthemselves (and they were ready to produce the money required) the Air Staff see no reason why facilities  similar to those contemplated for Egyptians and  Iraqisshould not be afforded.    7. The Foreign Office have expressed their readiness to instruct His Majesty&apos;charge  d&apos;Affaires  at Tehran in the  sense  of  paragraph 4 above, but have asked that the proposal should first be laid before the Cabinet.Air Staff, July 3, 1924.
