Franco-British Memorandum of July 9,1924, concerning          the Application of the  Dawes Scheme.    THE British and French Governments have agreed to submit to the Allied Governments the following note,  and recommend to their acceptance the conclusions therein set out:     1.  In  the view  of the British  and French Governments  the object of the conference to be  convened in London on the 16th July is to settle the method of putting into execution the Experts&apos; scheme so far as concerns the questions the solution of which devolves upon the interested Governments.    2.  The  two  Governments  recognise the importance  of   the economic  and financial  points  of  view,  and more  especially  the necessity  of  establishing a state of confidence which may give  the necessary security to the eventual lenders;  but they do not consider that&apos; thiq necessity is incompatible with respect for the provisions of the Treaty  of Versailles, a point which the considerations stated below will make perfectly clear.    Moreover, the violation of these provisions would lead to the collapse both  of the permanent foundation on which rests the peace SO. painfully  achieved and of the confidence in solemn  national engagements, and would tend not to prevent,  but  to inaugurate, fresh  conflicts.    8. The Experts were appointed by the Beparation Commission, who invited them on the 30th November, 1923, to  &quot;consider the means  of  balancing the budget and  the measures to be taken to stabilise the  currency  of Germany.&quot;    The Beparation Commission in this respect acted in virtue of the powers vested in them by  Part VIII of the Treaty of  Versailles, and notably  by article 284, which  runs as  follows :        &quot; The Separation Commission shall, after the 1st May, 1921,   from time to time,  consider the  resources and capacity  of   Germany,  and,  after  giving her representatives  a just oppor-   tunity  to be heard, shall have discretion  to extend the date, and   to modify  the form of payments, suoh as are to be provided for   in accordance with article 238, &amp;c.....&quot;   It  was in order to obtain enlightenment in the exercise of these powers  that  the Beparation  Commission   consulted the  ExpertsCommittees appointed under paragraph 7 of  Annex II to Part VIII,which runs as follows       &quot;The  Commission is  authorised to  appoint   all  necessary   officers, agents and employees  who  may  be required for the   execution  of its functions, and to fix their  remuneration;  to   constitute committees, whose members need  not  necessarily be   members  of  the  Commission, and to take all executive steps   2302  Wt.- 2500 7/24  F.O.P. [11836]
   necessary for the purpose  of discharging its  duties;  and  to   delegate  authority  and  discretion  to  officers,  agents  and   committees.&quot;   4.  The Experts submitted their reports    vrie Separation Corn-mission, who, by a letter dated  the 17th April, communicated themto the  interested Governments, stating  that  the  Commission  had unanimously decided :       &quot;(10 To take note of   the reply  in  which the  German   Government adhere to the conclusions of the Experts&apos; reports;      &quot; (2.) To approve within  the  limits of its  competence the   conclusions formulated in these reports and to adopt the methods   contained therein;      &quot; (3.) To transmit officially the reports of the Committees to   the Governments concerned recommending to them the con-   clusions which fall within their competence so that tho suggested   plans  may  produce  their  full  effect  as early  as possible,   &amp;c.......&quot;  &apos;                          ; -   As  the  Reparation   Commission  points  out,  certain  of  themoasures which have to be taken in order to put into operation the experts&apos;  Plan  are  thus  solely  within  the  competence  of  theGovernments.   This is, moreover, most explicitly stated in the Dawes Report,paragraph 3 of which runs  as follows:       &apos;&apos; If political guarantees and penalties intended to  ensure the   execution of  the  plan proposed are considered desirable,  they   fall outside the Committee&apos;s jurisdiction.          t      &quot; Questions of military  occupation are  also not within  our   torms of reference.      &quot;It  is, however, our duty to point out clearly that  our   forecasts  are based  on  the  assumption  that  economic activity   will be unhampered  and unaffected by any foreign organisation   other  than the  controls herein provided.  Consequently,  our   plan is based upon the assumption that existing measures, in so   far as they hamper that activity, will be withdrawn or sufficiently   modified  so  soon as  Germany  has put into execution the plan   recommended, and that  they will not be reimposod except in the   case  of flagrant  failure to  fulfil  the  conditions accepted  by   common  agreement.   In case  of such failure, it  is plainly for   the creditor Governments, acting with the consciousness of joint   trusteeship  for the  financial  interests  of  themselves and  of   others who  will have advanced money  upon the linos of  the   plan,  then  to determine the nature of sanctions to be applied   and the method of their rapid and effective application.&quot;   5.  It  becomes necessary,  therefore, that the creditor  Govern-ments should conclude  an arrangement in virtue of which theyengage to take  the measures within their  competence in order tobave the  Dawes Plan put into operation.   The British and French Governments declare that it is of  thehighest importance that  the Experts&apos; Report shall become operative    [11836]                                            B 2
without delay so as  to ensure the payment of reparations by Ger-niany and to bring the Allies back to co-operative action.   To this end the two Governments have agreed on  the followingpoints: .       ... .-.............. ,&apos;, (a.) A conference shall,  meet in London, on the.16th July; tho      .  -  two Governments note with satisfaction  that  the United          States of America have decided to be represented.   \b.) Tho  Governments  concerned will first of  all confirm the  -;    &apos;   acceptance, so far as they are.concerned, of the conehi-   ;  &apos;&quot;:  sions  of the  Dawes  Eeport an  acceptance which they          have  already announced individually to the  preparation a..&apos;Oj;.i&apos;.-ji!  Commission.   (o.)  The arrangements to be concluded  must not  diminish the     &apos;   \  authority  of the Reparation Commission.-  But in view of        &apos;  the fact that  some security must be given to the lenders          who provide the 800 million gold marks and to  the holders          of  the economic  bonds, the&apos; two Governments will  unite          in  an  effort to secure the presence of an American oil the          preparation Commission in the event of the  latter having          to  consider a default on the part of Germany. , If this          solution proved  impossible  and in the event  of tho          members of the Separation Commission being divided  in  ....     opinion as to  the  significance of the facts of  the case, the        .  two Governments would recommend that the  Reparation          Commission  should  call   in   the  Agent-Gener.al   of   &apos;,&apos;-&apos;   preparation  Payments,   who  is  to  be  of   American   &apos;    &apos;   nationality.   &apos;                          .   .  .   (d.) The  Dawes  Beport contains provisions  to .  meet..minor          defaults by means of the various supervisory, organisa-        .  tions; but an  important wilful default would  at Qn&apos;c.e raise          the question, of Germany&apos;s good faith.  In  the event  of          the preparation Commission declaring such a default, the  : &quot;;i  r&apos; &apos; Governments  concerned will undertake to confer at once  &quot;&apos;  \  on  how to put into operation such measures  as they shall          agree  to take in order to protect themselves and the          investors.   (c.)  The plan by which  German economic  and fiscal unity shall        &apos;  be  restored so soon as the preparation Commission  shall          havo decided that, the  Dawes Beport is in operation,  shall   ;       be settled at the Inter-Allied Conference.  The Reparation          Commission will be asked to prepare and present to tho          Inter-Allied Conference suggestions  for. such a plan&apos;.,   (/.)  Should experience show the necessity  for modifications  in          the Experts&apos;  Plan, such  modifications should  only  bo         introduced  subject to all  necessary guarantees and  by          common agreement between the interested Governments,          except in  so far  as the Reparation Commission already         has the necessary  powers.                      .   -?   (g.)  In  order to take f disadvantage of the reparation payments&apos;   i      provided for in the Experts&apos;  Report&apos;and  to Secure that        , they may  benefit  the  nations interested, ,the Allies  shall .
                               s         appoint  a  special  body  to  advise  the  Governments         interested  what  organisation should be  set  up in each         country for putting to proper use the  payments made by         Germany (in particular by way of transfers and deliveries         in kind).   (h.) It will also be necessary to settle the question who shall be         the authority to be.entrusted, if the necessity  arises, with         the interpretation of the Dawes Beport, as well as of the         arrangements to be concluded in  London for  putting the         Eeport into operation.   6.  In the event of difficulties of interpretation arising in eonnee-tion with the present document, the two Governments agree to referthese to their respective legal advisers.   7.  The  two  Governments have had a preliminary exchange  of views on the question of inter-Allied debts.  The British Governmentdeclare that they will, in consultation with the Governments con-cerned, seek an equitable solution of  this problem, due regard beinghad to all the factors involved.  This question is therefore referred for preliminary  examination to the experts of the Treasuries.   8.  The  two  Governments  have  likewise proceeded to  a pre-liminary  exchange of views on  the question of  security.  They are aware  that public  opinion requires  pacification; they agree   toco-operate in devising, through  the League of Nations or otherwise,as opportunity presents itself, means of securing this, and to continuethe  consideration  of  the  question  until  the problem   of general security can be finally solved.   Paris, July 9, 1924.
