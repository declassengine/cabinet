GIB I i E ISIB HUGH LANBrS PIC 1012S,Memorandum &quot;by the Secretary of State for the Colonies,,     In October 1913 Sir Hugh Lane, who was an  Irishmen,made a will leaving to the national Gallery in London39 pictures which he had previously offered to DublinbIn March 1914 he was appointed Director of tho national gallery of Ireland,  In March 1915, when he was con-contemplating a visit to New York, he wrote a codicil tothis will bequeathing the 39 pictures to the City of dublin, placed it in a sealed envelope addressed to hissistor in vifcoso keeping he had loft tho will, and leftit locked in his desk at tho National Gallery in Dublin,On his way back from New York he was drowned in tha&quot;Lusitania&quot;0  When the codicil was opened it was foundthat his signature was net witnessed.  There is evidence to show that Lane did not know that a codicil requiredto be witnessed, and the fact that he initialled a                                             i - 3)1&apos;; ,correction in the date suggests that he thought he was                    -1-

Tha  Trustees  of the National Gallerycontend that the  pictures  should be retained  by them     The attached report  on the matter  was circulatedby. my prececossor  in January 1923, but  he purposelyrefrained  from asking the  Cabinet  for a decision so longas the campaign of destruction in  Ireland continued^The Government of the Irish Pre a State  now asks for adecisions     I concur with  the  Duke of Devonshire in  thinking that an independent  tribunal should be  appointed toreport, if nooosary  by majority, on the equities of thocasoc  I therefore recommend that  -     Mr. George Barnes, late MePo  for Glasgow     Mr. J0W.

January 1923.SECRET.CP. 29(23).lCABINET.SIR  HUGH  LANES  PICTURES.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.    THE question  of  the  ultimate disposal of  certain pictures owned  by the  lateSir Hugh Lane has again been raised.    It may be remembered that  under his  original Will, Sir Hugh Lane bequeathedthese pictures to the  National Gallery, which has since been responsible  for theircustody.  By a codicil, which was not properly witnessed, he transferred the bequestto the City of Dublin.  The full history of the  case  is  described in the  followingCabinet Papers :     1. Note by  Mr. Macpherson  (then  Chief Secretary for Ireland)  covering  Memo-         randum from a deputation.   (G.T. 7823.)    2. Memorandum by the Trustees of the National Gallery.  (G.T. 8283.)    3. Extract from Minutes of 43rd Meeting of the Committee  of Home Affairs.    4. Extract from Conclusions of a Conference of Ministers held on the 17th Novem-          ber,  1919.    5. Memorandum by Viscount Long (then First Lord of the Admiralty.)  (CP. 162.)    1 am advised  that the legal position is  not free from ambiguity ;  it appears,however, that if, as is being urged in certain quarters, the pictures are to be handedover to the City  of  Dublin in accordance with Sir  Hugh Lane&apos;s desire, as expressed inthe codicil, legislation will be necessary to empower the National Gallery Trustees to dispose of their responsibility for them.    It has been  suggested  that an independent Commission  of three should  beappointed by Government to hear evidence and report on the equity of the case.   Inthe circumstances I recommend that this suggestion be adopted.(H.A.C 43 (2).)DEVONSHIRE.January 22, 1923.[9390]
        There has  been  further evidence of Hugh Lane&apos;s intentiongiven since this pamphlet was written.        At the great  meeting  at the Dublin Mansion House inJanuary 1918 Alderman Kelly told that he had met Hugh Lane in new York a few days before he sailed from there in the Lusitania,and having asked about  the pictures Hugh had said &quot;You will havethem back in Dublin.&quot;        Mr.  George Russell (A.B.) had told roe that on one ofHugh Lane*s last days in Dublin he said the same thing to him&quot;you will have the pictures back here.&quot;        Mr.  John Quinn,  the well known Lawyer and Art Collectorof New York has written to me more than once that from his con-Tersations with Hugh  when in  America he has no doubt of his intention to restore  them to  Dublin.    He is prepared to make anaffidavit to this  effect.        Mr.  Freeman Smith, writing from 9, Curzon Street, London,wrote me on May 30th. 1921 :Dear Lady Gregory,        I have read your book on Hugh Lane with the greatestinterest; and am writing you  that I may add my voice to those

Hugh Lane called on me the day before sailing, and i must have been one of the last to see him before he left England.This visit left a deep impression, as he was obviously ill at easeat the prospect of going away - his manner was disquieting and  sounlike the intense and enthusiastic friend I always welcomed.He spoke much of the journey and of the dangers of travel, andthen referring to the pictures he most definitely said &quot;I havealtered my Will so that the pictures at the National Gallery  shallafter all go to Dublin11, and knowing these were his sentimentsI feel it would be a breach of faith to do other than supportyou in your efforts to give effect to his last wishes, so if  Ican be of the smallest assistance please do not fail to call  uponme. -                  ?H P; &apos; - -           -:;^V:^:&apos;r&apos;:&apos;-:-  &apos;    &apos;-  &apos;   :                          Yours faithfully,                                  R.

SIR HUGH LANE&apos;SFRENCH PICTURES
SIR  HUGH  LANE&apos;S   FRENCHPICTURESBILL is about to be laid before Parliament to1\ make legal a  Codicil written by the late  SirHugh  Lane shortly before his tragic death in  theLusitania disaster on 7 May 1915.  I am the Trustee  named in the Codicil and so feel1 have a right to speak.  Hugh Lane, an expert in art, having made  somemoney by buying and selling pictures by Old Masters,founded when only  28 a Gallery in Dublin contain-ing work  by living and modern Masters. ireland had already a National Gallery on the same lines asthat of London, showing the works of past genera-tions, but in Dublin  there were no modern picturesof merit in  any  public  collection, students had togo out of  their country  to  see  what would besthelp their  own work, w]jat had been done  near theirown time.   He,  with  his  vehement enthusiasm,roused others to  help, he  himself giving  many finepictures.  Others,  owners and artists and groups offriends, did  the same; the present King and Queenwere among the donors; Mr.  Roosevelt,  then Pre-sident, was a subscriber; Mrs. Watts,  after her hus-hand&apos;s  death, carried&apos; out his unattested wish to giveone of his own  paintings to Ireland.  The DublinCorporation provided a  fine old house to be used asa  Gallery  for  the time  being;  a  Gallery was to be
built later, but difficulties as to a site were in the waj one in St. Stephen&apos;s Green which Hugh Lane had hoped for was refused;  of those proposed, some wentoo costly, some too cramped or too much out of theway.  Then, failing solid ground, it was proposed tobuild a bridge over  the Liffey to serve as a founda-tion in the  Florentine fashion.  Mr. Lutyens madeplans  for this  Bridge  Gallery,  so beautiful that many became enthusiastic, and the most enthusiasticwas Hugh Lane. He  set his heart on it, but objec-tions were  made, some  reasonable, some  frivolousand discourteous both  to  him and to  the  architectSome  newspapers were more than  discourteous, imajority of the  Corporation rejected the plan in thesame fashion.  And Hugh Lane, angry and disheart-ened, took away the conditional gift he had offered andexhibited the group of pictures named on pages 17 and18  of this pamphlet, and  which he had  described as&quot; Complementary to those already in the Gallery.&quot; Im-mediately afterwards, Oct. 1 i-M,  still resentful, he made a will, his last, which is nowheing carried out; init he says,&quot; I bequeath my Sargen t portrait, the ModemPictures now being shown in Belfast and any ModernPictures of merit (John Drawings, etc.), that I possessto the Dublin Gallery of Modern Art, other than thegroup of pictures lent by me to the London national gallery, which I bequeath to  found a Collection otModern Continental Art in London.&quot; But  his angersoon passed away, and though he  arranged to havethe pictures shown in London, we know from his ownlips that  his  preoccupation with Ireland made himhold to the hope  of bringing back to  the DublinGallery the pictures he had collected as complementary to  those already there..  In March 1914 he was ap-pointed Director of the National Gallery of Ireland.It was there, on  3 February 1915, that he wrote the
Codicil that is illegal only because his signature is notwitnessed, and that would be legal as it is, in scotland or in the trenches.  It is in his own handwriting andsigned by him; he locked it in his desk at the national gallery, addressed to his sister, Mrs. Shine. He says,&quot;This is a Codicil to my last Will to the effect thatthe group  of pictures now at the  National GalleryLondon, which I had bequeathed to  that Institution,1 now bequeath to the City of Dublin, providing thata suitable building is provided for them within fiveyears of my death.  The group of pictures I lent  toBelfast, I give to the Modern Gallery in HarcourtStreet. If a building is provided within  five years,the whole  collection will be housed together. the sole Trustee in this question is to be my Aunt, LadyGregory.  She is  to appoint any additional Trusteesshe may think fit.  I also wish that the pictures now on loan at this (National Gallery of  Ireland) Galleryremain as my gift. &quot; If within five years  a Gallery is not forthcoming,then the group of pictures at the N. G. London is tobe sold and the proceeds go  to fulfil the purpose ofmy Will.  Hugh Lane,  February 3rd, 1915.&quot; The &quot; purposes of his Will&quot; are  the sale of prac-tically his entire property (some legacies to his familyexcepted), to  be  invested and the proceeds given  tothe National Gallery of Dublin, &quot; the income to  be spent on  buying pictures of  deceased painters  of established merit.&quot;     * Because of the lack of a witness, the  pictures have become the property of the London National Gallery.Memorials were laid before the Trustees at their BoardMeeting on November  the 14th last by me  and bythe Representatives of  the  Educational Establish-ments and Learned  Societies of Dublin, and by theLord Mayor  and Corporation of Dublin, asking that
the last wishes of Sir Hugh Lane, as expressed in hisCodicil,  might be carried  out.  The Trustees, after consulting with  the  Treasury,  answered  that they&quot; have been informed by the Treasury, acting uponthe advice of the Treasury&apos;s Solicitor, that as trustees of the National Gallery they have no power to dis-pose  by gift to the  National Gallery of Ireland orany other body of objects which are vested in  themby  virtue of Sir  Hugh Lane&apos;s legally drawn and at-tested Will and of the provisions  of the national gallery  Act of 1856.&quot;  It is to  empower them tocarry out these last wishes of the Testator that we ask the help of Parliament to-day.                      AUGUSTA GREGORY.                  POSTSCRIPT   1 add to this statement a  statutory declaration byMrs. Shine, Sir  Hugh Lane&apos;s  sister, describing thecircumstances  under which  the Codicil was writtenand her reasons for believing that he intended it tohave  the weight  of law;  a  statutory declaration byMr. Martin, my nephew&apos;s close friend, and by Mrs.Duncan, curator of the Dublin Municipal Gallery, anda report of a  conversation by Mr. John Quinn, oneof the governing body of the Metropolitan Museumof New York, to show that  Sir Hugh Lane did notchange  his intention in the last weeks of his life.Mr. Quinn has wired that he has also made a statu-tory declaration, but I have not thought it desirable to delay the pamphlet for its arrival.

q ^ 7              APPENDIX  I  1, RUTH SHINE of Lindsey House, 100 CheyneWalk, London, S.W.,  Widow, do solemnly and sin-cerely declare as follows:  The late Sir Hugh Lane was a brother of mine andhe is hereinafter referred to as &quot; my brother.&quot; &apos;  In January  1915  my  brother  spoke to me ofmaking another will.   He went to Dublin, however,without having done so.   It was there (on February3rd)  that he wrote and signed his codicil and lockedit in  his desk at the National Gallery in a sealed en-velope addressed to me;  it was very  clearly  andcarefully written and I have no doubt whatever thathe considered it legal.  My brother had no business habits in the ordinarysense of the word and  was ignorant of legal technical-ities. He dictated both his wills to me, the first leavingall to the Modern Art Gallery in Dublin and the secondleaving all to the National Gallery of Dublin with theexception of the French pictures left to London.  Butfor my persistence neither would have been witnessed;even when he dictated the  second will he had forgot-ten all I had told him  about that necessity.  So littleam  I surprised at  there being no witnesses to thecodicil that my surprise  is  altogether that he shouldhave written  it so carefull^.   He  must have maderough drafts, as he composed letters with great diffi-culty, and the codicil was so well written.  I  think from my knowledge of him that if hethought of a witness  at all he would perhaps have considered that a codicil to an already witnessed will
NEEDED NO FURTHER FORMALITY.  WHEN HE SEALED UP THEENVELOPE HE  WAS GOING ON  A DANGEROUS JOURNEY TIAMERICA, AND WAS SO MUCH IMPRESSED BY THAT DANGEITHAT AT FIRST HE HAD  REFUSED TO GO AT ALL UNLESS THOSE,WHO HAD INVITED HIM FOR BUSINESS REASONS, WOULD IN-SURE HIS LIFE FOR  50,000 TO CLEAR.HIS ESTATE OF CERTAINLIABILITIES, AND HE THOUGHT HE WAS GOING NOT IN SEVENOR EIGHT WEEKS AS IT HAPPENED BUT IN TWO OR THREE.   I HAVE APPROACHED THIS SUBJECT WITHOUT ANY BIAS ISFAVOUR OF DUBLIN BUT  AS HIS  SISTER ANXIOUS THAT HISINTENTIONS SHOULD BE CARRIED OUT, AND I MAKE THIS DE.CLARATION CONSCIENTIOUSLY BELIEVING THE SAME  TO  be true AND BY VIRTUE OF THE PROVISIONS OF THE STATUTORYDECLARATION ACT  1835.                              RUTH  SHINE.   DECLARED AT MARKHAM HOUSE, KING&apos;S ROAD, CHELSEIIN THE COUNTY OF LONDON, THIS 13TH DAY OF FEBRUARY1917                   BEFORE ME                          G. F.

I, ELLEN DUNCAN,  CURATOR  OF  THE DUBLINMUNICIPAL  GALLERY  OF  MODERN ART,  17  HARCOUTLSTREET IN THE CITY OF DUBLIN, AGED 21 YEARS AND UP-WARDS MAKE OATH AND SAY AS FOLLOWS:   1.  FOR FIFTEEN YEARS I WAS ACQUAINTED WITH THE LATESIR HUGH LANE, WHO WAS  A CLOSE PERSONAL FRIEND 0!MY HUSBAND AND MYSELF.   2.  SIR HUGH LANE WAS  HONORARY DIRECTOR OF the municipal GALLERY OF MODERN ART UNTIL HIS DEATH. IWAS CURATOR FROM OCTOBER 1914.  WHENEVER HE came to DUBLIN HE SPENT A GOOD DEAL OF TIME IN THE GALLERY&apos;AND TOOK A KEEN INTEREST IN ITS WORKING AND OBTAINECSOME GIFTS FOR IT, THE LAST BEING A BUST BY RODIN.                        8
  3. I last saw Sir Hugh Lane on the last day of hisstay in Dublin before he sailed for America. He came to the gallery that day and had  a conversation with me about his collection of continental pictures whichwere then stored in the London National Gallery.He said  that he wished to  bring these pictures to dublin. He said that with regard to the building ofa new gallery he did not wish to insist now upon anyspecial plan but would be content if the Corporationreaffirmed their already expressed intention of build-ing  a gallery.  He asked me whether I thought i could get the Corporation to give some assurance tothis effect.  The words he used were, &quot; I do not wishto appear to  have &apos; climbed down &apos; about a new gallerybuilding, but I do not wish  to revive any of the oldcontroversies. I wish to bring the pictures back to-Dublin as soon as possible,  and they might be  re-hung here pending the building of  any gallery theCorporation may decide upon.&quot;  4. The impression I gathered from the conversa-tion aforesaid was that Sir Hugh Lane had definitelymade up  his mind to adhere  to his original intentionwith regard to these pictures which he bought for the dublin Municipal Gallery of Modern Art.  He ex-pressed  himself as  indignant at the  way in whichthese pictures had  been  treated  by  the  LondonNational Gallery, with the result that the public had.no opportunity of seeing them.                    ^    ELLEN  DUNCAN.

    I, ALEXANDER MARTIN, of 37,  Vicarage  Road, East Sheen, do solemnly and sincerely declare as follows: I have been asked to state in a word my  impression of Sir Hugh Lane&apos;s wishes regarding these  Pictures, in so far  as I gathered  it in conversation with him when I accompanied him to  Liverpool.1  I am pleased  to accede  to this request, and I should like to preface it  with the remark that  it was the more strongly fixed in my mind because  his wishes as he  expressed them were not those with which 1 had most sympathy.  Personally, I should have pre- ferred to have seen the  Pictures  placed in London rather than in Dublin. From earlier conversations I was aware, of course, of Sir Hugh Lane&apos;s deep in- terest in Ireland, and was not,  therefore, at all sur- prised when on this occasion he spoke of it, and of his recent visit to Dublin, with the greatest affection. He spoke to me also of the Modern Gallery, referring again to the  ambition  he  had entertained  when col- lecting the Pictures of seeing them housed in Dublin, and he gave me to understand  that his mind was made up that it should after all be the destination of his Pictures, and I make this  declaration conscienti- ously believing the same to be true, and by virtue of the Provisions of the Statutory Declaration Act, 1835.          Signed   ALEXANDER MARTIN.  Declared at No. 15 Duke Street, St. James&apos;s, in theCounty of Middlesex, this 27 day of February 1917.Before me,                A.  FAIRLIE ALLINGHAM.

As we recognize that the pictures  are the legal property of the National Gallery we believe that their return would be an act,  not  only of justice,  but of generosity,  and we would  respectfully suggest that the Trustees apply to  Parliament for  the necessary powers.  The signatories to  this  Memorial  have all con- tributed pictures to the Dublin Municipal Gallery, believing that their work would hang  in a  great re- presentative collection  of modern painting, and are convinced that the breaking of the collection someof the pictures going to London and some remaining in Dublin would lessen the value of the whole, toArtist and to Student alike.   We have the honour to be,          My Lords and Genoemen,                  Your obedient Servants,                               JOHN LAVERY.GEORGE ATKINSON.

STEPHENS GREEN,                               DUBLIN.                                 &quot;January 291b, 1917,SIR,   I  HAVE THE HONOUR TO PRESENT HEREWITH ON BEHALF OFMY  COMMITTEE THE  ENCLOSED  MEMORIAL  FROM 150IRISH ARTISTS  AND  MEN OF  LETTERS, PETITIONING HISMAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT TO  GIVE  EFFECT, TO THE LASTWISHES OF THE LATE SIR HUGH LANE, AS EXPRESSED IN THECODICIL TO HIS WILL, WITH REGARD TO THE DISPOSAL his COLLECTION OF MODERN CONTINENTAL PICTURES.               I AM,                 SIR,                     YOUR OBEDIENT SERVANT,                         BEATRIX  DUNCAN.                             Hon. Secretary.THE RIGHT HONOURABLE DAVID LLOYD GEORGE,       PRIME MINISTER OF ENGLAND.    To the Right Hon. David Lloyd George, Prime             Minister of England.SIR,   WE,  THE UNDERSIGNED IRISH  ARTISTS AND &quot;WRITERSVENTURE TO APPEAL TO YOU AS THE HEAD OF HIS MAJESTY&apos;SGOVERNMENT TO GIVE STATUTORY RECOGNITION  TO THETERMS OF THE UNWITNESSED CODICIL OF SIR HUGH LANE&apos;SWILL, BEQUEATHING HIS  COLLECTION  OF  MODERN CON-continental ART TO THE CITY OF DUBLIN.   THESE PICTURES WERE ORIGINALLY HUNG IN THE DUBLINMUNICIPAL ART GALLERY AS A GIFT CONTINGENT  ON THEERECTION OF A SUITABLE GALLERY, AND REMAINED THERE FORSOME YEARS, PENDING THE FULFILMENT  OF THE CONDITIONS.   OWING TO CIRCUMSTANCES  INTO WHICH WE NEED NOTHERE ENTER IT  WAS  NOT FOUND  POSSIBLE TO FULFIL THENECESSARY CONDITIONS WITHIN THE SPECIFIED  TIME. SIR                        22
Hugh Lane then removed the pictures from Dublinto exhibit them as a loan collection in London, inorder that their merits might be more widely known,and while there he devised them  in a duly executedwill to the National Gallery of England.  Subsequently, however, Sir Hugh Lane revertedto his original  intention, as expressed in a previouswill, and  bequeathed the pictures&apos; by the codicil towhich we have alluded, to the City of Dublin.  Although  this codicil was not witnessed, it  is in-disputably under his hand and signature, nor is there any doubt in our minds that this was his real desire.  Sir Hugh Lane repeatedly expressed his determina-tion in conversations with  his friends before his lastdeparture to the United States, to restore the picturesto Dublin, there to form the nucleus  of that per-manent collection of Modern Art which he  con-sidered so essential to  the interests  of Art in hisnative country.  Although the Trustees of the National Gallery ofEngland  do  not  dispute  the authenticity  of  thiscodicil and view  sympathetically the claims of theCity of Dublin, they are  nevertheless precluded intheir fiduciary capacity from carrying out its terms.  Knowing as  we  do how universal is the desire inIreland that these  pictures should  return to Dublin,we appeal to  His Majesty&apos;s Government to introduce legislation givingVeffect  to the codicil.    We have the honour to be, Sir,                        Your obedient servants,Joseph Poole Addey.      Mary Barton.George Atkinson,         Rose Barton, R.W.S.  R.H.A.                Louie Bennett.W.
