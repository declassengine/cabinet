(THIS, IOQTJMMI IS  TEE PROPERTY OF  HIS  BRITAMIO MAJESTY&apos;S GQW:)B C R E T.     -       0 A B I  H E  T.p.  395/84,                  IMPERIAL WIRELESS SERVICE,                3 9        MEMORANDUM BY THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY&quot;.          I would refer to the Post Master General^ memorandum cp, 376(24).          The Admiralty particularly wish to emphasize  their agreement with paragraph 5 of the memorandum and  would  add thatthey do not consider that the new short wave(Beam)system can  be relied on in war time or emergency -to the same extent as theproposed super High Power long wave stations since under certaincircumstances of deliberate enemy interference the reception of these short wave signals would,.become, impossible.          In the case of this new system deliberate interferencecould be employed to prevent reception without detriment to theenemies own communications.          Should therefore one or all of the Dominions  decidenot to proceed with the erection of Super Power long wave stationsthe erection of one or more elsewhere than in this country or theDominions will become&apos; a matter of urgency for strategical reasons.(Intd)   C.  Admiralty,8th July,  19M0
