[This Document  is the Property of His  Britannic  Majesty&apos;s Government.]                     (Printed for the Cabinet.    July 1924.)SECRET.CP. 392 (24).    I circulate  for  the information of my colleagues  the following private  and personal telegram from the Viceroy in regard  to  the  situation  created in Bengal bythe issue of an injunction  by the Calcutta High  Court restraining  the President ofthe Bengal  Legislative Council from putting  to the Council a  certain resolution which the Government had intended should he discussed on the 7th July.    I do not propose, to comment on this situation until I receive further details.                                                                   OLIVIER.    9th July 1924.                   Telegram from Viceroy, dated 8th July 1924.    Private and personal.   I have  received the  following private and  personal telegram from Lord Lytton :      &quot; Private  and personal.   Intolerable situation has been created here  by HighCourt interference in the affairs of the Legislative Council.  On the application of theSwarajist  members of  the  Legislative Council, Mr. Justice Ghosh has issued an injunction against the President, restraining him from putting resolution regardingMinisters&apos;  salaries to-day.  Such  action must seriously undermine the authority ofthe President,  who decided that he could not take the chair until  he  was clearly andauthoritatively relieved from  the  possibility  of such external interference.  I have therefore prorogued Council, and we are appealing against the order.&quot;    I have  not yet sufficient material to enable me to consider the  decision  of the judge.  I have telegraphed  ray  sympathy to Lord  Lytton,  and promised him allassistance  and support in clearing the situation.7476    100   7.24
