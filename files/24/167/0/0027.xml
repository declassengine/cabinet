Relation of Shop Stewards to the Trjadqa Dillons.                Memqrandxm byn. the First Commissioner of Works.                     With reference to Cabinet 24  (24) Conclusion fcfaj           I attach a memorandum handed by me to  the Trades Union           representatives in ot-nnoction with the recent  claim by          -Engineering Attendants of my Department for an increase in           wages.  The following Councils and Committees are included           in the Whitley Council system for Government Industrial           Establishments as censtitutod and set up by agreement botwecn           Government Departments and the Trades Unions concerned.  So           far as the Office &amp;f works is concerned, the constitution Is            Tactically confined to london.                (a)  Shop Committees.  The employees 1 sides of these           Committees are chosen from the Department&apos;s employees and           vary in number according to the size of the chop.  The           representatives thus chosen for the Committees aro in effeot           stewards under the Shop Stewards Movement which is very strong           in the Board&apos;! establishments.  The Committees deal with           domestic matters and are not empowered to decide anything of           a general nature affecting other districts er traversing           general trade practice.  Any matter of general import or any           disagreement of the Shop Committees may be referred to                (b) the Central Ocmmittoea, of which there are three for           the Engineering Division, the Building Division and the           Supplies Division, respectively.  Tho employees&apos; sides aro                                                              chosen
 chosen  as  a rule  two from each Shop Committee,  and the Committeea  deal&apos;&apos; with matters affecting- the whole of the districts  in the  Divisions concerned,  and the;&apos;- consider mattero  which have  led to disagreement on the Shop Committees  but they are not empowered  to deal with wages questions  and cannot give decisions traversing  ordinary trade practice.   Disagreements are referred to      (c)   the Departmental Joint Industrial Council,  upon which employees are represented by trades union offioialo, usually  the London  District Secretaries  of the  Trades  Union. This Council deals  with matters affecting the whole of the industrial  staffs of the Department and  does  net daai  with rates of wages, though it has the power to modify Trades Union and  Industrial conditions to meet  the peculiar needs cf the Department.   It  is  at, this.....pointy in the,  constitution that the Shop Stewards  Movement becomes  dissatisfied with the arrangements.   they(consider that  theyf and  not the Trades Union Officials,  should sit on  the Council,  and this view strikes  at the  very root  of Trades  Union control  of labour in  industry.   My Department has no control over the representatives on  the  Trades  Union side,  but it would not welcome having to deal  with the Shop Stewards on this Departmental. Council, as agreement is  more readily arrived at with the*Trades  Union Officials than  v^ith  the Shop Stewards, the  attitude  taken up by the lat\pr being generally parochial  whereas  a  wider aspect is usually appreciated by officials cf  the Trades Unions.   At  this Council discussion  is taken  out of  the control of  the  Shop Stewards, who may at  any time  be co-opted  but who have nodecisive voice in considering  any  queotion.   fetters uponwhich disagreement  is recorded  on  the  Departmental  council may be referred to one  of                                          \i       (d)
     W the Trades Joint Councils, but this is not oftendone.  Tho Trades Joint Councils deal primarily with ratesOf wages and are divided as follows           (1)  The Engineering Trades Joint Council.           (2)  The, Building       &quot;     &quot;      &quot;           (3)  The Miscellaneous  11            &quot;           (4)  Tho Shipbuilding   &quot;     &quot;      &quot;          The omployees are represented on these Councils byTradea Union Officials usually attached to the NationalHeadquarters of tho Unions, and the Official Sides consist ofrepresentatives appointed by the Treasury, Ministry ofLabour, Admiraltyj War Office, Air Ministry and Office ofWorks, other Departments being co-opted on occasion, ifnecessary.  The Shop Stewards are usually very much dis-satisfied with any suggestion to refer matters to theseCouncils as they know that they cannot expect the TradesUnion Officials to take their own parochial view of anysubject under discussion?  Trades Union officials havehithorto acted on the prinoiple that although the Governmentshould be a model employer, its wage rates should bear somerelation to the rates paid for similar work elsowhero, though they contend that Government rates should be something abovethe mimlmum rate agreed between the Trades Unions and theEmployers&apos; Federations.  This principle the Shop Stewardsdefinitely repudiate utterly regardless of the effect oftheir defiance on the extension of the policy of direct labour or on the inevitable refusal ultimately of lower paid workers to agree to maintain a privileged class of workersin Government service.          In the event of disagreement on one of theseCouncils arbitration is usually resorted to,  but there is nofurther appeal under the Whitley system, tho alternative being                                                      to.
to approach the Ministers direct or  to  strike.      (o)  The Joint  Co-ordinating Committee.  The  supreme council of all under the Government  Industrial whitley council is the Joint Co-ordinating Committee under theChairmanship of a Treasury official  and composed ofrepresentatives from the Trades Joint Councils.  ThisCommittee is not a Court of Appeal  from those Councils, butdeals with mattors which are of common  interest to allgrades in all Government Industrial  Establishments.     My officers have found that the Shop StewardsMovement generally is inimical to Organised Trades Unionism,and is undoubtedly Inclined to be an insurgent movement,favouring direct and local action rather than constitutionalor Trades Union pressure.  In the Office of Works  the shop stewards Movement has been captured  by  the Electrical TradesUnion and their policy is usually directed by the  officials of that union.  The  constitution of  tho Industrial WhitleyCouncils frequently  refers to the Shop  Stewards as being the body through which the local Shop Committees should work.  Ineffect,, therefore, the Employees&apos; Slde,of the Shop Committooaare the Shop Stewards] and no man can be represented throughthe Whitley Council  unless he, is a member of the shop stewards&apos;Organisation in addition to being a Trades Unionist.The Shop Stewards; have an entirely separate organisation andits members pay a small weekly subscript!on in addltien totheir Trades Union levies:  they have a Chairman and secretary and no account pfjheir proceedings is sent to theTrades Unions.  I understand, that there are cases  in myDepartment of men who are Trades Unionists  but who  are not members of the Shop  Stewards&apos; Organisation and are  therefore not represented on the Committee.   The action of the  shop stewards indicated in the attached memorandum Is more or less                                                    typical
typical of other recent happenings in my Department,though understand that the Trades Union Officials, as a result ofthe representations which were made to them, have dealtfirmly with the position, andr so far as Departmental action is concerned, there appears to be no remedy except t;-\ refuseto discuss any question bearing upon wages with anyone otherthan accredited representatives of the Unions as a  v&amp;iole.The trouble appears to be due to the somewhat rebelliousattitude of the Shop stewards  Movement as against the TradesUnion leaders.  In the event of disagreement with the unions on such claims, the Department will insist on their presenting the claims at a mooting of the Trades Joint Council concerned.                                   P.W.J.                                    31st May, 1924.
MEMORANDUM BY THE FIRST COMMISSIONER OF WORKS.

Presented to Trade Union Representatives at 11, Downing Street, Saturday, 12th April, 1924.

Claim of Engineering Attendants.

For come time past the Fngineering Attendants employed by the Office of Works in tho London District have  expressed dissatisfaction at their rate of pay, and they were informed, and of course had previously quite well understood, that their rates were controlled by the rates paid in the Engineering Industry, but were in fact some few shillings above that rate. The men in question received the full Engineering bonuses granted until July 1921, and raised no objection to their being considered as parallel with the  Engineering Industry, but expressed dissatisfaction when the Engineering cuts were imposed upon them.  They had never on any occasion formulated any definite claim for any other rate to be paid to them until the 18th March of this year, when the First Commissioner of Works received a deputation representing the Engineering Attendants. At that meeting they requested that the practice of following the rates of the Engineering Industry should be discontinued, and that a rate similar to that paid under the Joint Industrial Council for Local Authorities Non-trading Services should be applied to them.  Mr. Jewett? informed them that this was a matter which must be discussed on the Engineering Trades Joint Council for Government Industrial Establishments, and ovary facility was offered them for the calling of an early meeting of the Council, with the result that the meeting took place on the 26th of March, when the men concerned had tho opportunity of placing their case before the Council. The
          The Official Side of the Council offered the..Trade Union Side a reply to their claim within a fortnight of the date of that meeting, and the TradeUnion Side agreed to this postponement.   On the 9thinstant, exactly a fortnight after the meeting, theSeorotary of the Trade Union Side was informed that theOfficial Side were unable to grant the rate claimed,but wore prepared to refer the claim to arbitration.          The constitutional method which should havethen been followed was, of course, that the Trade union side should have beon given an opportunity of considering the offer mado by the Official Side, buton the  10th April, before the Seoretary to the TradeUnion Side had had any opportunity of consulting hisoolleaguoa, members of tho Shop  Stewards movement inthe  Office of Works., reinforced  by certain Trade UnionOffisials not members of the Engineering Trade joint council, waited on the First Commissioner of Works and announced their intention to call a strike of all thisengineering employees of the Office of Works, and of themen  employed in the Building and Supplies Divisions ofthat Department in addition, unless their demands were met..     *          As a result of further negotiations action has  been postponed until Wednesday next.          Meanwhile the First Commissioner of Workswishes  to invite  the attention  of the  Trade union representatives to the  very  unsatisfactory position inwhich  they  themselves,  and the First  Commissioner, are placed by the  unconstitutional action  of  the  shop stewards in refusing  the Trade Union  representativesan opportunity of discussing the offer made to themand  of precipitating  direct  aotion  in  the manner                                          indicated.
indioated,-  Unless the prooouure governing the  relationsbetween the First Oomraiasioner and organised  labour  isunderstood and observed by all concerned,  there will undoubtedly be constant friction and complicationsbetween himself and the Trades Unibnh on the  one hand,and the Shop Stewards on the other hand.i
