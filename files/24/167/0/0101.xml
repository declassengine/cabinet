Koto by the Secretary of State for the Colonies,    covering letter from Mr. Justice Feetham, Chairman    Designate of the Irish Boundary Commission..     As a matter of urgency I submit to my colleagues theattached letter, and recommend that the Law Officers of theCrown be requested by the Cabinet to include the questionproposed by backward  Justice Feetham in tho special reference whichis being made to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council,under Section 4  of the Judicial Committee Aot, 1833, in thematter of the Irish Boundary Commission.(Intdo)  J.  H.  Toolonial Office,     14th July, 1924,
           Copy of letter from Mr.  Justice Feetham to the                 Secretary of State for the Colonies.                                               14th July, 1924.Dear Mr.  Thomas,     Article 12 of the  Treaty contains, as you know, no expressprovision enabling the  Commission which is to determine &quot;the boundariesbetween Northern Ireland and the rest of Ireland&quot; to act by a majority.     I observe that in  the course of debates in Parliament in 1922 onthe Irish Free State Agreement Bill the question was raised as to .whether,  in view of the absence of anTr such provision, it would notbe necessary for the validity of an&quot; decisions of the Commission thatsuch decisions should be unanimous.     This is obviously a question of vital Importance in relation tothe proceedings and work of the Commission.   As the person designatedto be Chairman of the Commission I feel that it is my duty to suggestthat advantage should  e taken of the special opportunity afforded bythe meeting of the Judicial Committee, to which certain other questions arising under Article 12 have been referred,to obtain a ruling also onthis further question.    If the present opportunity of referring thisquestion to the specially constituted Committee which is being-assembled for the purpose of dealing with the other questions is allowed to pass, there will be a risk, in the event of the Commissionbeing brought into existence, of its work being delayed at a-later stage, or of doubts being raised as to the validity of its decisions which it would take some time to remove.      I venture therefore to suggest for your consideration that thefollowing further question  should be included in the Reference to. theJudicial Committee:-          Whether a Commission  constituted under Article  12  of the         Treaty will be  competent to decide  questions by  the  vote         of  a  majority,  and  if  so whether  the Chairman will have a         casting  vote,  or whether the decisions  of  the Commission         must  be  unanimous?                              Yours  very  truly,                 .  &apos;  ,              (Sd). RICHARD FEETHAM.8  Right Hon.    J.H. Thomas,  M.P.
