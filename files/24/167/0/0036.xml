THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY rS                        GOVERNMENT.                             CANINE T.S 33 C RET---------.1     HOURS  OP  INDUSTRIAL  EMPLOYMENT  BILL,C,P.335(24).---------------------------                  Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air.(,1)              I desire strongly to support the First Lord of      the Admiralty in the views he has expressed in his      Memorandum C,P, 327(24)  regarding the Hours of Industrial      Employment Bill and to endorse the suggestions he has made      for its amendment.   Like the First Lord, I am in entire      sympathy with the general objects of this &apos; Bill but, in      my view, unless the amendments he proposes are embodied,      some of its provisions will seriously prejudice the      efficient administration of the Royal Air Force.(2)              One additional amendment is essential in the      interests of aviation,    Clause 7(c) of  the Bill excludes      from its scope &quot;persons  employed on the  transport of      passengers or goods by sea or inland waterway&quot; ,   It is      necessary that this clause shall be amplified to provide      for the exclusion also of persons engaged upon the      transport of passengers  or goods by air.    The exclusion      of persons employed in the small marine  craft attached      to the  Royal Air Force  can no doubt be provided for by any      amendment which meets the First Lord&apos;s point as to tugs      and dredgers.                                                   T.                             Secretary of State  for Air,      AIR MINISTRY,      June 3rd, 1924,
