[This  Document is  The Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.&quot;!                Printed for the Cabinet.   May 1924.SECRET.             I         .                                            mCP. 303  (24).           CABINET.  SPECIAL   REPORT    ON    UNEMPLOYMENT.          No.   104.   Period ended April 28,  1924.    THIS report  covers a period of five weeks, and the unemployment figures forthe period show a net decrease of 15,739. or 1-5 per cent., of the total unemployed onthe 24th March.   The  figures  shown in the  tabular statement below are not comparable with figures shown in  my previous reports because, as is explained inthe footnote,  the basis  of these  statistics has been extended to include short-timeworkers unemployed on the dates given.    The slight increase in respect of juvenile unemployment is due to the fact thata school term ended in the first week in  April, and many juveniles registered on leaving school.    The total net  decrease for April was less than the decrease recorded in my lastreport for March.   This is probably due in some measure to two causes : (1) the fact,that firms in  the  depressed  trades  closing their works for the Easter  holidaysextended the period of  suspension; and (2) the temporary stoppage of work in the shipbuilding industry, which not only dislocated work in the shipyards, but reactedupon the allied trades.    I would draw attention to  Part  III of this report,  containing a note  of thespecial efforts made to find work for disabled ex-service men.

Decrease  326  (187 men, 139 women) due to increased repair work in the    shipyards.                II.-POSITION  IN  CHIEF  INDUSTRIES.    Coal  Mines. The employment position generally  remains good, and there isan  unsatisfied demand for skilled underground workers.  Unskilled and surface workers, however,  remain in excess of the demand.  In the North-Eastern Countiesthe demand for coal for  immediate requirements remains good and the outlook isreported to be fairly good.   The home trade is brisk and export  trade well maintained.  New  coal seams have been struck at Doncaster,  and increased employ-ment is anticipated there shortly. No change is reported from the Lancashire coal-fields.   In the Midlands trade  remains, good  in  most districts,  and  in  NorthStaffordshire, Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire there is a keen demand for skilled and unskilled underground workers.  The housing  shortage is  a serious obstacle inconnection with the transfer  of men to meet the demands in certain districts.  Inthe South-Western Counties,  Bristol and Somerset pits are fairly busy, and thereis continued activity  in the Forest of Dean.   In North and South Wales employ-ment remains good, and  there is an increased demand for colliery  workers.   AtDowlais three.collieries have  been closed as unremunerative, affecting about 2,500men, but a considerable proportion of the skilled and semi-skilled workers are beingabsorbed in other  collieries.  The unemployed register  in this industry  in Walesconsists almost entirely of unskilled or semi-skilled miners and surface workers, whoare somewhat advanced in age, and the problem of finding employment for such men.over 46 years of age is extremely difficult of solution.   In Scotland,  both the homeand foreign trade has  been well maintained.  During the month nearly 2,000 miners were suspended on  account of  railway wagon shortage, but this difficulty has,  in themain, been overcome.     *    Stone  Quarries.-The  employment position  remains  good,  especially  atPortland.    China Clay. The Cornish pits are busy and the employment position is goodon the  whole, although a considerable surplus of labourers remains unabsorbed.    Iron Mines. Serious depression continues in this industry.  In the Clevelanddistrict the position has become worse during the month.  Arrangements have beenmade with certain colliery companies for the transfer  to the collieries  of selectediron ore miners now  unemployed in this area.  In the Cumberland and Barrowdistrict three mines have  resumed work during the period, but there is considerable uncertainty as to future prospects.    Tin Mines.- The employment position remains fairly  good amongst skilled workers.  Many labourers remain on the unemployed registers, but unemployment has been reduced slightly  during the month.      [11603]                                                       B 2
IRON  AND STEEL  PRODUCTION.    This industry generally remains very depressed,  and the employment position,both in the pig iron section and general iron and steel section, is, on the whole, bad.In the North-Eastern Counties, at Middlesbrough, Stockton and Thornaby, increasedunemployment has occurred or is anticipated.  At Scunthorpe,  where 19 out of apossible 22 furnaces are in blast, suspensions of workpeople have occurred, but areattributed to lack of transport facilities rather than lack of orders.  In the Sheffieldarea foundries and forges are busier, but lack &quot; advanced &quot; orders.  Additionalfurnaces have been started during  the month in this  district, and firms engaged in manufacturing  acid steel are in a better position than for a considerable time. Thedemand for the best qualities of mild steel is  increasing.  Rolling mills, particularly those producing sheets, are actively employed on work for  home and continentalconsumers.  A  slight improvement is reported in the  crucible steel  industry, butthis branch is by  no means working to its  full capacity.  In the North-western counties, at Barrow,  Bolton, and Workington,  large concerns are either  closed down entirely, or working intermittently.  At Wigan rolling mills which have been engaged  on short time  for over  two years, have  now secured sufficient  orders to provide full time employment for some months to come.  In the Midlands  theemployment position varies considerably in  the different centres,  but work on thewhole  has declined slightly.  In Wales  the employment situation is much  betterthan in the other large centres of this industry, and  in some districts furnaces are working  at high pressure owing to large demands.  At Dowlais, however, employ-ment is irregular, and suspensions have occurred at Port Talbot.  No importantchange  in the  position is reported from Scotland.   The situation  is  uncertain,although the volume of work  executed is  considerably  greater than at the corres-ponding  period  last year.  At the moment  the prospects are considered brighterthan at the end of last month.TIN-PLATE AND STEEL SHEET.     Trade continues good in South Wales, with the exception of one establishment at Llanelly, where 250 workpeople have received one  month&apos;s notice to terminateemployment.  The new Tinplate  Selling Agency,  which includes  the  principaltinplate firms, has now started business, and consumers will be in a position to dealdirect with manufacturers.SHIPBUILDING  AND  SHIP-REPAIRING.     Little or no improvement  has occurred in this industry during the month underreview.  The general stoppage of work arising out of the Southampton strike  causedmuch dislocation,  but,  except  in that port itself, the  industry has appeared to haverecovered from the effects of the  dispute.  The announcement  of the allocation of the Admiralty contracts for the building of cruisers has raised hopes in the districts Avhere the work will be carried out.  On the Mersey repair and re-conditioning work is steady.  At Barrow, the position has improved a little,  and, no doubt, appreciable advances will be made when Messrs. Vickers start work on  the construction of the cruiser.   There is some activity at Canning Town  and Deptford on the Thames. At  Southampton  the  work available provided for  employment for only half  the number  of men engaged prior to the strike.  At  South-Western Ports no improve- ment is  reported, except at  Avonmouth,  where  there  are very few skilled men unemployed.  At  the South Wales Repairing Ports work is  not plentiful, a  decline being reported  at  Cardiff and Swansea.  On the  Clyde  orders  for new and repair work are  reported, in addition  to  Admiralty contracts,  and it  is anticipated these will give  the industry some impetus in the  near  future. ENGINEERING.      Motor and Cycle Engineering. The employment position in this branch of the industry continued good.   During the month ended the 28th  April there  was .no appreciable diminution  of activity.  At Coventry manufacturers enjoyed a period of  remarkable prosperity, particularly  pronounced  during  the week preceding Easter.  Trade in small cars at Birmingham was active, and the seasonal demand for motor cycles was  considerable.  Overtime was worked in some  centres,  notably Nottingham, in the ordinary  cycle trade.  Increased activity was the feature of the month in nearly all districts.
     General Engineering. The employment situation in the general section of theindustry has improved appreciably during the month, but is on the whole still slack.In the North-Eastern Counties increased employment has been due chiefly to homerailway orders and occasional contracts for locomotives for foreign countries. Wagonbuilders  in Sheffield  have received further orders, resulting in increased activity inthe axle, tyre, and spring departments.  The machine tool trade remains quiet inthis  area, but the demand for this class of goods is increasing in consequence of progress made in electrical and motor engineering.  Agricultural tools and equip-ment are in request,  the hack saw trade is active, and from Keighley it is reportedthat textile machinery makers are busy.  The marine engineering section has received an impetus at Newcastle and Wallsend in consequence of the Admiralty orders forpropelling and auxiliary machinery for cruisers.   In Lancashire  and district some improvement has occurred in nearly all sections of the trade.   Railway orders have affected many large works in this area, and there has been an increased demand for skilled fitters  and  turners  in the locomotive  engineering  centres.   Activity isdisplayed in electrical machinery, heavy oil engine, printing machinery, mining and flour-milling machinery sections.   The textile machinery  section in Lancashireremains very slack.   In the Midlands trade remains fair  at Rugby and improvementhas  occurred   at Chesterfield,  Peterborough,  Smethwick  and  Stoke-on-Trent.Depression continues at Nottingham and Worcester.  Electrical engineering remainsgood at Coventry and has improved at Birmingham.  The Staffordshire district  hasnot secured  much benefit from orders  from the  Railway Companies.  Enquiries inconnection with bridge building have improved the outlook in the constructionalengineering  section.  In London and the Home Counties reports continue to indicatefairly general improvement, but trade is still slack in a number of districts, includingEast Anglia.   The manufacture of agricultural  implements shows an advance atBedford, but  general  engineering there  has  fallen off.   In  the  South-western counties a distinctly improved tone was shown during the month.  Marked advanceoccurred at Bath and Swindon; also at Exeter, where there are no skilled engineersunemployed.   Trade was fairly good at Newbury, Oxford, Poole and Yeovil.   some improvement was reported from Gloucester,  forest of Dean, Basingstoke, Taunton,Chard and Weymouth; but depression continues  in Bristol,  Cheltenham, reading and  Westbury.   Employment has been fairly steady in Wales.   The  industry  hasshown an upward tendency in Scotland.   Machine tool trade has revived at John-stone, and this improvement would normally foreshadow  work of a more substantialnature.  At Springburn an order for ten large locomotives has been placed by  theWestern Australian  Government.  At Motherwell constructional  engineering firms have obtained  a contract for  bridge reconstruction in  Northern Ireland,  and a contract for condensing plant for a large generating station  has also improved  theoutlook in that district.TEXTILES.     Cotton. The Egyptian  (fine spinning)  Section of the industry continues in aprosperous condition,  and the  maximum output is  being  maintained.    In  theAmerican Cotton Spinning Section trade is still  poor and, with few exceptions, firmscontinue to  curtail production  by stopping  the mills for  three days per week or,alternatively, on alternate weeks.   There is little prospect of resumption of full time working in this Section for some months, but there is a feeling amongst spinners that.a temporary increase of production would be advisable on certain counts owing to existing scarcity.     In the Weaving Section of the industry the state of trade in fine plain and fancycloths remains  good,  but  in  other branches it  is bad.   There is a tendency  formanufacturers to turn their attention from plain to fancy cloths.   The China market for fancy cloths is showing signs of revival after being stagnant for a long  time.    Woollens and Worsteds.-Further marked improvement has occurred throughoutthe  industry,  and reports  from  the Heavy Woollen Districts  are  particularlyencouraging.  Dewsbury cloth mills are busy and most of the blanket, rug and carpetmakers are well employed.  Shoddy, mungo and flock manufacturers are in a better position than at any time since 1920.   Enquiries on export account have  grown more numerous during the month.   Orders from Japan have  been  received for light-weight mixtures and serges, and the South American  demand for fine cloths is increasing.  Linings and cheap serges are going to India and  Canada.     Hosiery. The  improvement previously reported is being  maintained,  moreparticularly in  hose and fancy wear; but in the Underwear Sections there is still a
considerable amount of short time working.  At Basford, Leicester, Mansfield andNottingham there has been a marked improvement, but trade has somewhat slackenedat Derby, Rugby and Sutton-in-Ashfield.    Lace. The employment position remains bad.  Plain Net and Curtain Sectionscontinue to be better employed than the Leavers Section, but there has been a  falling off even in the Plain Net Section.  Enquiries for higher grade and better class goods are being received.    Silk. The employment position has greatly improved.  Short time working ismuch  less  prevalent, and  the  number of  totally unemployed has  considerablydecreased.   At Leek extensions  of buildings and the construction of new premises are proceeding.   Some  firms are  working  overtime.   Practically  all short  time working at  Coventry has  ceased, and at Derby and Cheadle  the position is good.At Macclesfield the silk weaving industry is fully employed.    Jute. Trade in Forfarshire continues brisk, and the shortage of weavers hasresulted in  nearly  2,000 spinners  at Dundee  being  put on  short time since the1st X\pril.   Dundee employers are accepting  girls for training as weavers, but theyhave declined to train unskilled unemployed women.    Carpets. Trade continues brisk at Kidderminster.   Employment is good atWilton and  Swindon.BUILDING AND BRICK AND  TILE  MANUFACTURE.    There is no new feature to report in connection with the building industry.  Theemployment position remains very good, and the demand for bricklayers, masons andplasterers continues to be  in excess of  the  supply.  In many districts there is  a seasonal shortage of  experienced  painters  and paperhangers.  The unemployedregisters for this trade now consist mainly of unskilled labourers.    The brick and tile trade is good, and full  time is being worked at Derby, Oldbury,Peterborough, and in the firebrick yards at Stamford and Stourbridge.  All firebrickyards at Brierly Hill, however,  are very slack.   The building  trade at Portsmouth,Bristol, Poole, Exeter and Torquay reports a shortage of bricks, and at Bristol andPoole supplies are being obtained from Belgium.CLOTHING.     The seasonal activity is affecting all districts  and unemployed registers in all.parts of the country have been reduced in this trade.  Wholesale tailoring is reportedto be very  busy in  all main centres.  There has been  general improvement in thedressmaking trade.   The corset trade is good at Derby and Kettering, has  improvedat Bristol,  Bath and Portsmouth, but is quiet at Leicester and Rugby.  The  shirtand collar trade is good at Barnstaple, but slack  at Bridgwater and Taunton.  Theglove trade  at Yeovil and Barnstaple is improving, but  the surplus of labour is stilllarge.BOOT AND SHOE.     The employment position on the whole is poor.  Trade is fairly satisfactory atNorthampton,  but  inclement weather is  said  to  be adversely  affecting seasonaldevelopments.  At  Kettering unemployment remains heavy, and no great improve-ment is expected until there is increased export trade.   Unemployment has increased at Wellingborough  and Raunds.  Trade is fairly busy at Leicester and Derby and very good at Bromsgrove and Mansfield.  The position is somewhat better in Londonand the Home Counties, where steady improvement has been maintained.  Trade  isstill very slack in centres in the South-Western Counties.POTTERY.     Employment continued slack generally, but there was evidence of slight improve- ment during the  month.   In the Tile, Sanitary, Earthenware and Fireclay Sections, employment was  reported to be good.  In Staffordshire trade was poor  on the whole. The position in the porcelain trade at Worcester remains good, and the china  trade at Derby is good and has shown  further improvement.   Trade was moderate at Bristol and bad at  Glasgow. About 26 per  cent, of the workpeople in this industry are engaged on short time, working on an average about thirteen and a half hours less than full time.   Trade was reported as busy  at Bristol, Poole, Exeter and Barnstaple..
2 dtTRANSPORT.    There has been no change of importance during the month in the dock transporttrade.   In  most ports trade is quiet, and  the general employment position is only fair.III.-A  NOTE  OF  THE  SPECIAL EFFORTS  MADE  TO FIND  WORK                  FOR  DISABLED  EX-SERVICE  MEN.    1. After the Armistice, and when men were being demobilised very rapidly, itwas felt  that some special arrangements were necessary to obtain employment for those  who were disabled, over and above the steps taken to secure resettlement of thefit men.    2. It was decided to proceed on  the basis of an effort to persuade employersvoluntarily to engage  disabled men in a definite proportion  to  their total staffs.After consideration of various proposals, the National Scheme for the employmentof disabled ex-service men was inaugurated by Royal Proclamation in August 1919.Under this Scheme employers were invited to join  the  King&apos;s  National  Roll, the qualification being that they should give a  written undertaking  to employ a statedpercentage of disabled ex-service men for a period of at least twelve  months.    3. The normal requirement  for enrolment is that an employer  should employdisabled ex-service men up to a percentage of 5 based on his total staff.  A  reductionof this percentage has, however, been agreed in the case of industries, or in the caseof individual firms, where conditions have made it difficult to reach the  full 5 percent, standard [e.g., the employment normally of a considerable number of women).    4. Broadly, for the purposes of the Roll,  a disabled ex-service man is a man inreceipt of  a  disability pension, but there  are slight variations  of  this  definition(e.g., a man who has ceased to  receive a  pension can still count in  the percentagequota while in the employment  of the firm  which employed him when  he was inreceipt of a pension).  .  5. The following figures give the approximate number of firms on the Roll:     It should be explained that at the beginning of 1922 employers who had been onthe Roll for one year or more were asked to renew their undertakings.  This pro-cedure,  which was spread over two years (but is now carried out automatically),resulted in the removal from the Roll of a certain number of firms who were unableto satisfy the conditions.  Presh enrolments have, however, been  obtained,  and arestill being obtained, and the current figure of firms on the Roll includes only thoseemployers who fulfil the conditions for enrolment.    6. The number of disabled ex-service men employed  by  firms on the Roll is approximately  330,000, which  gives  an overall  percentage  of  6-7  of the totalemployees of the firms enrolled.    7. It should be noted that the percentage of disabled ex-service men employedin Government Departments is now 14-45, while the percentage employed in  Govern-ment  Industrial Establishments works out at well over the 5 per cent, required ofprivate employers.    8.  The  Government  decided  on a  rule,  which  came into operation on the1st June, 1921, that-        &quot; Save in very exceptional circumstances, all firms contracting for Govern-    ment contracts, to whom the conditions for membership of the King&apos;s National    Roll are applicable, must be on the King&apos;s Roll.&quot;X1L UJJ.C UCg-l-Uli-LXlg Ul li/AJ. ...At the beginning of 1922 ...At the beginning of 1923 ...At the beginning of 1924 ...Present date at the beginning of 1920 ...At the beginning of 1921 ... 9,50023,50029,50030,60028,40028,800Restriction of Contracts to Firms -on the Roll.
this principle  has  been followed by  a number of Municipal Authorities, notably the London County Council.  The number of Local  Authorities who restrict their contracts to firms on the Roll is now 180, and a further 262 give a preference to suchfirms.  The adoption  of this  rule by the Government and Local Authorities  has considerably stimulated enrolments.               Numbers of Disabled Ex-Service Men Unemployed.    9. In October 1922 a return was obtained of all unemployed disabled ex-servicemen registered at the Employment Exchanges.   This return indicated a total of65,000, of which between 9,000 and 10,000 were on a special register of ex-servicemen whose disability handicaps them in finding employment.    10. In June 1923 disabled ex-service men on the general unemployed registerand the special register were classified as follows:         Category A. Men whose disability would not prevent them from returning    to their usual  occupation,  or to an analogous occupation, under  ordinary    industrial or commercial conditions,  after training if necessary.        Category B. Men whose disability would prevent them from returning to    their  usual occupation, but  would not preclude  them from employment under    ordinary industrial or commercial conditions on what  might be  described as a    &quot;light job.&quot;        Category C. Men whose disability renders it difficult for them  to be    employed under ordinary industrial or commercial conditions, except in some    institution specially designed for ex-service  men suffering  from very severe    occupational disability.    11. A further &quot; census &quot; of all registered disabled ex-service men was made inMarch 1924, and&apos;the figures obtained indicated :              Category A     ...       ...      ...    25,355Category B     ...       ...       ...     11,718Category C     .......       ...      1,575      Total     ... &apos;      ...       ...     38,64813,293It is understood that  these figures  are  not accepted as complete by the british legion, who hold the view that the number is nearer 80,000.  The Ministry of labour are engaged in examining the figures of the census with that body.  The approximatetotal number of men in  receipt of disability pension or final weekly allowance for march 1924 is stated by the Ministry of Pensions as 680,000.                                Recent Efforts.     12. As the result of a discussion in the House of Commons in April 1922, a select Committee was set up to          &quot; Examine and report upon  the  systems adopted  in other countries to     provide for the employment of  disabled ex-service men, and to recommend a     system  under which men  who have  suffered disablement in the service of the     country may be secured employment.&quot;This Committee recomended  that the  principle of decentralisation and  devolution of authority and power should be adopted,  with a view to making the best use oflocal knowledge, local  enthusiasm and local conditions.   They accordingly recom-mended that local King&apos;s Roll Committees  should be set up, presided over by the mayor, &amp;c, and that the membership should include local influential persons, repre-sentatives of employers, trade unions, ex-service  men&apos;s organisations,  Red  Crossand of Local War Pensions Committees  and Local Employment Committees.  TheCommittee also recommended that a central body, the King&apos;s  Roll National Council,,should be set up to co-ordinate the activities of these local Committees.     13. The Select Committee detailed  the functions which they considered thatthese bodies should carry out,  and  concluded their report  (H.C.  170)  with the-following observations  :          &quot; So urgent is  the problem that  your Committee  recommend  that  their     proposals should be  carried into effect  forthwith, and the necessary  legislation     passed during the Autumn Session. But should the figures show that the problem     has not by  the 1st May, 1923, been successfully dealt with on the lines proposed,     recourse should then be had to a form of compulsion modified in character and     scope as circumstances may dictate.&quot;
    14. The  Select Committee presented their report in August 1922, and  after a delay caused  by a General Election,  the Minister of Labour proceeded on the lines suggested.  Steps were taken to set  up local King&apos;s Roll Committees in the largermunicipal  areas,  and there are in existence  at the  present  date 258 of  these committees.   In  areas. not  covered  by  these  Committees,  Local  employment committees continue to carry out the work.    15. The  King&apos;s Roll National Council was set up under the Chairmanship ofField-Marshal Earl Haig^ and held its first meeting on the 20th February, 1923. TheCouncil has met, on an average,  once every two months,  and in July  1923 submittedan Interim Report (Cd. 1919).  This report made various suggestions  for stimulating the work of finding employment for  disabled men, and  the Council concluded theirreport with the following observations :         &quot; A  little more than four months have elapsed since the National Council    and the Local Committees  came into existence.   The period has  not been    sufficient for a definite conclusion to be reached as to the adequacy of the whole    scheme recommended  in the Select Committee&apos;s report.  The Council, however,    feel they are in a position to say that the country as a whole still maintains its    serious interest in the work done for the men disabled in the war,  and that the    scheme has succeeded in awakening local activity on behalf of these men.  It ia    true that the provision of employment for the disabled men has not proceeded    quite so  rapidly as  the Council  at one time  hoped,  but  this must be attributed    mainly to the fact that, although trade has improved within  the last six months,    the improvement  has  been subject to fluctuations, and is not even now  flowing    in a steady current.   The problem of finding employment for the disabled men    is so obviously related to conditions of trade that the Council need not  deal with    this aspect in greater detail.                     ^           4^                       ^        &quot; In reviewing the position in the light of the recommendations of the Select    Committee,  the  Council  have  formed the  conclusion that   the system  of    decentralised voluntary effort is right.  Provided, therefore, that  the winter does    not bring another severe  slump in trade, we believe that with the continued    assistance of the Local Committees and the Press, and the maintenance, at least,    of the present support given by the public, it should be possible to  make,  by    existing  means,  coupled  with  the recommendations we   have submitted,  a    substantial improvement in the position, without recourse to alternative methods    of compulsion.&quot;    16. The  Ministry of Labour have been able to carry out the main suggestion of the  National Council,  and,  in  particular,  arrangements have been  made forGovernment  assistance to undertakings which are not  run  for  private profit, andwhich provide employment for men so severely disabled that they cannot be expectedto obtain work under normal industrial conditions.    17. A  considerable  volume  of opinion  in the country  has  been in favour  ofincreasing  the  disability  pensions of  unemployed disabled ex-service men.   Thisproposal has  been resisted by the National Council and By the Ministries of Labourand  Pensions.   The basis of  the present assessment  was  endorsed  by  therepresentatives of ex-service men.    18. The  various efforts  indicated in the preceding paragraphs are in additionto grants from the Civil Liabilities Department to enable disabled men to  set up in business on their own,  or Industrial Training given by the Ministry of Labour.  the placing of men trained under the Industrial Training Scheme in improverships formsan integral part of the work of local  Committees.    19. Suggestions have been  made  from time to time by  ex-service men that legislation should be introduced  to make the employment of disabled  ex-service mencompulsory.  The representative of the British Government opposed resolutions tothis effect at  an International Conference at Geneva in July 1923.
    14. The Select Committee presented their report in August  1922, and after a delay caused by a General Election, the Minister of Labour proceeded, on the lines suggested.

To assist in the  provision  of employment  for demobilised  members of HisMajesty&apos;s Forces until such time  as  they could  be re-absorbed into industry, theGovernment after the Armistice inaugurated a special fund for the purpose ofmaking grants on certain conditions to  Highway Authorities for  road work.

No further  properties  are  being acquired, and it is anticipated that for the future cash receipts will suffice to meetcash outgoings.                              LAND SETTLEMENT.(A.)
