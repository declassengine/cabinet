THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS ERITTANIC MAJESTY&apos;S                         GOVERNMENT.CABINET.$ret1.340(24) Memorandum by the Minister of Health.I desire to oonault the Cabinet regarding the actionto be taken by the Government with resoeot to the amendments madeby the House of fprda to the above-named Bill,                       &apos;          There are two amendments to Clause 1 which I think theGovernment would wish to aak the House of Oommona to dls agree with,and one about whioh I feel some doubt.  The first amendment withwhich the House of Commons would probably disagree is the insertion of the words &quot;or for any son or daughter of his over &quot;eighteen yearsof age&quot;.  The effeot of the insertion of these words would be to empower the Courts to grant possession to a landlord on the ground of greater hardship,  without it being necessary for him to providealternative aoooomodation, not only where he required the house forhis personal occupation but also where he required it for the occupationof a son or daughter over 18 years of age.  The amendment would restoreone of the very conoesslona to landlords which it was the expressobject of the Bill to remove.is the proviso inserted in Clause 1 with regard to aliens,  underwhioh the Courts would be required to discriminate against  an alien landlord or tenant, as the oase may be, where the &quot;hardshipinvolved to the landlord by refusing *an order for possessionwould be equal to the hardship involved to the tenant by grantingit, unless the alien served the British Empire or its allies inthe Great War.   Quite apart from other objections to this amendment I understand that the Foreign Office take the view thatit should be resisted on the ground of its inconslatence  with oertatreaties with Foreign Powers.          The third amendment to Clause 1 ia the omission ofthe words &quot;not being a landlord who has become owner bypurohase of the dwellinghouae after the fifth day of May,The second amendment whioh I think should be contested
r00, fi nineteen hundred and twenty-four&quot;.    The  effect  of those  words  is  to require a IHTVUW&apos;. purchasing  the  dwelling house  after the fifth day of May, nineteen hundred and twenty-four,  to  provide alternative accommodation In all oases as  a  condition of  being granted possession, irrespective of his pleading greater  hardship.    In substance the omission of these words is perhapB not very Important, because  the greater hardship test will still be applioable  and the date when the landlord bought the house would  be a  factor in  the estimation of such hardship, but I have no doubt that many members of the House of  Commons will be anxious to  have those  words  reinserted in order to  safeguard  tenants from the  fear of possible  eviction.          The other amendments made by the House of Lords are to Clause 2,  Under Clause 2, as  amended, the courts would have power to  rescind orders or judgments which  have not at any time been executed, but they could not,  as the  Clause originally provided have the power t^ resoind orders or judgmentswhich have been executedion  or after the 15th April, 1924;  and even the  limited power leftIto  them by the lords  Amendments would be discretionary and nollonger obligatory on the application  of the tenant, as originallyIprovided,   The effect of these  amendments is to cut out  the1                                  &apos;Iprovisions which were inserted in  the Bill to prevent a possibleIrush of  evictions in the interval  between the date of thelintroduction  of the Bill and  the date of  its  passage into law,ll do not myself think that there is very  much point in theIpetention of  those provisions  now.   They will  have served theiripurpose by remaining in the Bill up to the time  when they wereis truck out by the House of Lords,  but, as the Bill should pass  intojl&amp;iv within the next two or three weeks, there cannot be now muchIpsk Of orders be ins executed  In the  meantime.    It will  be observedI F&apos;hat the House nf Lords ;&apos;have  left  in  the  Bill the original sub-  lause  (3) of Clause 2, Although this sub-clause has little,.if any, leaning now in view of tlhe deletion of the previous sub-clause,                      (Itottd,)  J(W jjpry of Health,  th June, 1924.
