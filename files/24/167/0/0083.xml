THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.CABINET.SSCRETiC.P.&quot;380(S4).UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE (NO.2) BILL.WAITING PERIOD FOR BENEFIT.Memorandum  by  the  Miniate r  of  Labour.It is necessary to come to a decision with regard to theattitude to be taken on the Report Stage of this Bill nextWednesday with regard to an amendment to reduoe the waiting period for benefit from six days, the present period, to three days.An amendment to this effect has been put down by two Members ofthe Lioeral Party (Mr,  Travelyan Thomson and Mr, Graham White)and two belonging to the Labour Party (Mr, Climie and Mr, Hugh Seely),      An amendment to the same effect was defeated in committee by 10 votes to 8 - a largeaf numbs&apos;? of members abstaining - and theresult would have been a tie if Mr, Sexton had not Inadvertentlyvoted against the amendment.      It costs about the same to pay 18/- a week with six waitingdays as to pay 15/- a week with three waiting days.      The principal difficulty about the amendment is that offinance,  It is estimated to cost an additional 4^ millions annuallyIn benefit,  the equivalent of at least 3d weekly in contributions.It will  be  recollected that when the draft of the Bill was originallybefore tho  Cabinet lt vf&amp;s strongly insisted upon that the scheme should be financially solvent.  The changes made in Committee havesubstantially redticed the margin originally provided.  During the deficiency  period (i.e, so long as the present high contributionscontinue) there is now estimated to be an annual margin of about 5,000,000  without, allowing for the cost of the new trade disputeclause,  which may be anything from, say,  1,000,000 to  3,000,000.After the end of the deficiency period, when the contributions fall to a  total  of ls,6d (6d each from employer, workman and the State)as a  maximum, there is an estimated margin of not more than about 100,000 per annum, without allowing for the cost of the tradedisputes clause.                           &apos;             ^X/It
       It will be clear, therefore,  that on these  estimates  the   reduction of the waiting  period of three days would  leave   praotioally no surplus during the  deficiency period  in other   words, it would prevent the present debt of about  7,000,000 from   being paid off, and, if unemployment becomes worse,  would  inoreaao   this debt.  The defioienoy period  with its high  contributions   would therefore be indefinitely prolonged.  After the defioienoy   period, if we suppose it  to be terminated, the scheme would be   definitely insolvent with the maximum contributions  now provided   for that time, and in order to make the scheme solvent at  least 5d.   would have to be added to the Is,  6d. now contemplated as  a maximum.       I propose in any event to make one small ohange costing about    150,000 annually in the  &quot;continuity rule&quot;, whioh would allow the   continuity of unemployment to be bridged over six weeks instead ofI   three weeks as at present.  This is a small oonoossion in  the same   connection as the amendment now under discussion, and I should re-   present it as the utmost  concession whioh it is  prudent to make;  &quot;but in spite of the financial difficulties I have mentioned, I feel   very doubtful whether I shall be sucoessful In resisting the largerI   amendment.  It is likely  to have considerable support from the!   Liberals, and I fear ^hat even if  the Government Whips are put  on\   against the amendment a number of  our own supporters will  feel bound   to vote for it,  A Government defeat on a point  of this kind oannot   be lightly faced, and for this reason I have come to the conclusion   that we ought not to risk such a defeat.  The aotion whioh I should   propose to take, if my oolleagues  agree, is to state fully the   arguments against the amendment as outlined above, and, while   admitting that In this and other respects the Bill is not  all that we!   might have wished to make it, emphasise that the present amendment   oannot be inserted without wrecking the finanoe  of the scheme.   Having made these points, if the oourse e.f the Debate shows a                                                    /considerable,______.__-_________^AotiM
considerable volume of support among our own  Party I should announce that in viow of the opinions expressed by the supporters of the Government the decision will be left to a free vote  of  theHouse,     I have disoussed the matter with the Chancellor of theExchequer who is equally as anxious-as I am that the cabinet should settle the question.                          .
