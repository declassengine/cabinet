 To the Right Honourable J. Ramsay Macdonald, M.P., Prime Minister    and First Lord of the Treasury, and Secretary of State for    Foreign Affairs,                                            26th  June,  1924.Sir,1.          The Cabinet decided on the 4th instant [Cabinet 36(24)]that the question of a proposed subsidy for sugar beet should bereferred for consideration and report to&apos;--             THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER             THE MINIbTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES             THE SECRETARY FOR SCOTLAND             or representatives of their respective Departments.2.          In pursuance of this decision we were appointed torepresent the Ministers concerned with the following terms ofreference!-                       &quot;To enquire and report,  without  prejudice             to the principle of avoiding State assistance by           .  duties or subsidies, whether under the existing             scale of protection there is a reasonable  prospect             of the Sugar Beet industry (a) continuing and (b)           .  developing in this country, and, if  not,  what is the             minimum amount of additional State assistance necessary             to enable it to do so.   The possible effects of the             immediate establishment of the industry on a more             extensive scale in providing substantial employment             should also be considered and reported upon.&quot;3,          For the purpose of our inquiry we have taken evidence from the following?-            Ivlr.

Andrew VANEECK, who was appointed by the                        Advisory Committee under the                        Trade Facilities Act torepresent                        them on the Board of the Anglo-                        Scottish Beet Sugar corporation.Lord WEIR, (Chairman of the Directors of the Anglo-           Scottish Beet Sugar Corporation).4.          Vie have received a considerable quantity ofInformation as to the position of the industry in this country from Mr, Alfred Wood, who is Secretary of Home Grown Sugar Ltd.,the owners of the Kelham Factory, Assistant Secretary of theEnglish Beet Sugar Corporation, the owners of the Cantley Factory,and also Secretary of the British.Sugar Beet Society, apropagandist body.5.          We have also referred to the report of the specialCommittee&apos; of Inquiry, of which Sir William McLintock, K.B.E.,C.V.O.,  was Chairman, which examined the financial position and prospects of Home Grown Sugar, Ltd, in January, 1922.6.          The first point to which we directed our attention was whether the Sugar Beet industry can (a) continue and (b)develop under the existing scale of protection, which consists of remission from the payment of. any excise duty on sugarmanufactured from home grown beet.  This amounts in effect to a subsidy of 11/8 per owt, of sugar.7.          With-regard to the continuation of the  industryin the two existing factories at Kelham and Cantley there  was
general agreement among bur witnesses, and we endorse theiropinion, that the existing scale of protection is insufficient for Re1ham though- it is possible that the Cantley Factory mightbe able to continue.8.          With regard to the development of the industry we agree with the emphatic opinion of all our witnesses that theexisting scale of protection, coupled with the uncertainty ofthe future outlook owing to a possible further reduction in the sugar duty, has destroyed all hope of a development . of theindustry by the erection of new factories,   sir James Martinassured iis that no financier would agree even to examine on its merits any proposal for a new factory unless he were assured ofsome measure of stability over a reasonable period of years, andthere is no doubt that all the plans which were on foot beforethe reduction in the duty for the erection of new factories willbe abandoned unless some further assistance is granted on a stable basis.9.          The crucial factor is that a new factory will not be erected unless it can be sure of obtaining a sufficient supplyof beet at prices which it can afford to pay.   The existing scale of protection is insufficient to enable a factory to pay to the farmers in the initial years a price at which they will makecontracts to grow beet,10,          The only evidence to the contrary was contained inthe figures submitted to the Trade Facilities Committee by theAnglo-Scottish Beet Sugar Corporation, to which reference wasmade by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in his memorandum to theCabinet (CP.330(24) ),11.          These figures suggested that with a c,i*fc price forsugar of  23 a ton and a duty of  6. 5,0a factory would make a profit of  6, 16. 0 a ton of sugar produced.  We find that they wereprepared by the Technical Manager of the. Corporation on the basis
of a Canadian Factory which had been running for five years,and that they assumed a state of effioiency, both in the factory and on the farm, which could not possibly be reached in thiscountry for a number of years.   Lord Weir informed UB that hehad given instructions for this statement to be prepared so asto show the results which might ultimately be achieved afterthe industry had become firmly established, and he estimatedthat the factors which would be present in the early years would raise the manufacturing oost by at least  6 per ton, i.e. from 8.17.Od. to  14.17.0d.          We have examined the figures and have come to theBame conclusion.   We are satisfied that a manufacturing costof  8..17.0d. a ton is far lower than could be secured by any new factory in the early years.    The actual cost of manufactureat Kelham and Cantley, which have had several years1 experience is  16.2.8d. per ton, and on this basis the anticipated profit of  6.16. Od. per ton would be converted to a loss of  1.17.8d.per &quot;ton.   The figures also assume that beets could be purchasedat 32/- a ton, which is far less than it would be necessary topay to farmers in the early years, and further they assume thatan extraction rate of 11.76 per cent, would be obtained, a ratewhioh no factory would secure except after some years&apos; experience.Kalham only obtained 8 per cent, extraction in the first year and though this was unduly low, a new factory would probably not secure more thun 10 per cent, extraction at the outset,12.      We are satisfied, therefore, that the figures submittedby the Anglo-Scottish Beet Sugar Corporation cannot be regardedas reliable and that they re-enforce-rather than rebut thenecessity for some further assistance in the early years.15,       We proceeded, therefore, to consider the measure ofadditional assistance required, and we have borne in mind theneoessity of confining it to the minimum necessary.     Thegoverning factor is the price that it will be necessary to offer
to the farmers to Induce them to grow beet.   For the last twoyears, owing to the high price of sugar, the farmers have receivedspecially attractive prices.   Last season the average price was57/2 per ton of beet delivered at the factories&quot;, but the net price^received by the farmer was reduced by the cost of transport which amounted in some cases to as much as 10/- a ton.   This may be compared with the price of from 25/- to 30/- a ton which was paidto growers in Holland where the industry has been established fora long period.   On the other hand the yield last year was badowing to unfavourable weather and only averaged Q% tons per acre,whereas an average yield of 10 tons an acre should be secured ina normal year by growers with some experience.   The average yieldin Holland is over 12 tons an acre.14.       Tho representatives of the National Farmers&apos; Unionexpressed the opinion that a price of 54/- per ton would benecessary to attract new growers in a new district, and they stated that the average cost per acre of growing beet anddelivering it to a factory was from  17 to  19 an acre.   fethink that these estimates are too high, but we recognise thatin the early years it will be necessary to pay a price for beetconsiderably in excess of that paid in Holland.   High yieldsand beet of high sugar content cannot be secured except after several years1 experience and farmers will require some specialinducement to undertake the growing of a new crop which requiresadditional expenditure on labour, fertilisers and implements andwhich both in the spring and in the autumn frequently calls forthe whole labour strength of the farm to the detriment of otherfarming operations.15.      After careful consideration we have come to the conclusionthat in the early years it will be necessary to ensure to the farmers a minimum price of 44/- a ton for beet of 15-1 P^r cent.sugar content delivered to a factory, with the possibility of earning more for boet of higher sugar content and with anadditional payment to those who enter into a three years or
five years contract.   The actual prioe would also  depend onthe price of sugar, so that the farmer would benefit  .fay  anyrise in price above 34/- a cwt, duty paid which is  the  marketestimate for next season.   Under a system of this  kind a goodgrower should be able to secure 50/- a ton on a three yearscontract and it would act as a direct stimulus  to effiaienoy andintensive cultivation.16.       We may add that in recommending a minimum price of44/- a ton we have had regard to the opinion expressed  bySir William MoLintook^ Committee in 1922 that  a price  of 38/-a ton, whioh was then suggested, would  not be  sufficient toensure supplies.17.       3n order to enable a minimum price of 44/- to be paidper ton of beet we are satisfied that a subsidy is  necessary inaddition to the existing scale of protection.    In  consideringthe amount of subsidy required we have also had regard  to thenecessity of securing such stability to the industry as will attract capital for the erection of new faotories.   Prom thispoint of view the possibility of a further reduction in the  sugarduty cannot be ignored and it is most important that the  Chancellorof the Exchequer should not have his hands tied in  any  respect in considering that question.   If...we proposed a subsidy in  additionto the present benefit of remission from excise, a  further reduo-tion of the customs duty would destroy the stability whioh is  soessential to the industry.   We have come to the conclusion,therefore, that any subsidy granted, should be sufficient  to  includethe existing benefit due to remission of excise and that  thoappropriate excise duty should be reimposed on  home&apos;grown sugar.If this was done a further reduction in the customs duty  wouldbe accompanied by a corresponding reduction in  excise and theindustry would not be affected detrimentally.
18.          We have considered also the period for which any subsidy should be granted.  We are convinced that it isessential that it should be for a limited -period only and thata subsidy can only be justified if after suoh limited period the industry can stand alone.  We are encouraged by *.hc example of Holland to believe that this can be  secured,-  In thatcountry the sugar beet industry after receiving some initialhelp from the State, has continued and developed for the last4c years without any State assistance of any kind, and it nowsupplies the whole of the domestic needs of the country andhas a considerable surplus for export.  On the other hand we know of no country In the world in which the Sugar Beetindustry has been established without State assistance Inthe early years.19,          After full consideration we have come to theconclusion that a period of  ten^ears Is necessary duringwhich State assistance is required to enable the industry toget on its feet and develop  sufficiently to enable it to standalone.  It will take time before  any number of new factoriescan be erected and before they have attained full efficiencyor are working to full capacity.  But from the agriculturalpoint of view time  is even more necessary,  Farmers  are a veryconservative  class and cannot quickly be persuaded to altertheir methods and undertake  the growing of a new crop.A  considerable amount of educational propaganda will be neededboth to get them to  grow beet and to secure high yields andbeet of high  sugar  content,  Ufa believe, however, that aperiod of ten years will be  sufficient  for that and that thesubsidy might be on  a diminishing scale throughout that period.This would have the  further  advantage of supplying an incentive to the . erection of  new factories in the n&amp;ar future so thatthey would get the  benefit of the higher rate of subsidy inthe early years:,,  Wo may add that the period of ten years wasthat adopted  by the  Government  in 1920  in connection with the
Kelham factory, when tbsy agreed to guarantee for a period often years a dividend of 5 per cent, on the shares subscribedby the publio,20,          We recommend that the subsidy should be paid inrespect of each ton of sugar produced,  &quot;?e considered thealternative of a subsidy per ton of beet grown, so that itshould go direct to the farmers, but there are considerableadministrative difficulties in such a method, and we aresatisfied that a subsidy per ton of sugar can be coupled withsuch conditions as to the payment of a minimum price to the farmers etc., as will secure that a fair share of the government assistance goes to the farmers.  The presence of an ExciseOfficer in each factory will ensure an effective control overthe factories in this respect,21,          In considering the amount of the initial subsidyrequired we have had regard to the necessity of encouragingnesf growers in new districts and of attracting capital for theerection of new factories.  Prior to the reduction of thecustoms duty the remission of excise was equivalent to a subsidy of  5/8 per cwt, of sugar.  The reduction of the duty reduces the subsidy to 11/8 per cwt * of sugar.  We have come to theconclusion that in order to secure the development of theindustry a subsidy somewhere between these amounts is required.The old rate of 25/8 has enabled the two existing factories to make satisfactory profits and to pay high prices to farmersfor beet.  The new rate is insufficient to attract capital forthe erection of new factories or to enable even the presentfactories to pay for beet a price at which the fanners will growthe crop.  We consider that, as between the rates of 25/8 and11/8, a rate of 19/6 per cwt, la the minimum necessary in the initial years to secure the objects in view.  We are confirmed in this opinion by the report of Sir William McLintock&apos;sCommittee in 1922 which stated as follows               &quot;The only possible chance of such undertakings          &quot;showing a reasonable commercial, return on the          &quot;Capital to be invested seems to involve total
          &quot;remission of excise duty on the  sugar          &quot;produced and a further bounty should the          &quot;existing rate of duty be reduced.   This          &quot;relief may be taken at  20 per ton of          &quot;sugar,&quot;22,          Our recommendation is, therefore, slightly lessthan that suggested as necessary by Sir tfilllam McLintock&apos;sCommittee.  Moreover, we do not consider it necessary that thesubsidy should be maintained at the rate of 19/6 per cwt, forthe whole ten-year period, and we agree with the proposal ofthe Minister of Agriculture that It might be reduced to 13/-per cwt, after four years and again reduced to 6/6 per cwt,after a further three years.  At the end of the ten-year period the subsidy should be withdrawn  altogether,  Bxciseduty at the appropriate  rate  (at present 9/9 per cwt.) shouldbe charged from the outset, so that the net cost to theGovernment of the  subsidy at  the hipiiest rate would be 9/9,per cwt.23.          In considering the whole question we have had regard to the words in our reference that we  are to report&quot;without  prejudice to  the principle of  avoiding state assistance by duties or subsidies&quot;.  We recognise fully theobjections to subsidies or protective duties  and we shouldnot have  recommended such assistance  to the Sugar Beetindustry  if we had not been convinced  that  it cannot  beestablished, by any other means,   It necessitates considerablealterations of customary practice  in agriculture, which  is  themost  conservative  and  slow moving industry  in the country,and State assistance may be justified  as being  largely in thenature  of an educational grant.   Moreover, the  subsidy wehave  recommended  is not open  to  the serious objections which apply  to  the usual form of subsidies to agriculture.  Theactual  amount paid is -based  on  yield  and sugar content sothat  it  is a direct stimulus  to  efficiency and from the
national point of view there is complete security that nosubsidy will be paid except for results attained which would.not be secured without it.  It is also material to pointout that the Government has already accepted the principleof protection for1 the industry by agreeing to continue there mission of excise, which is a concealed subsidy, and thatour proposal does not introduce a new principle, but onlyvaries the amount.  It has the further advantage of substituting a direct subsidy for a concealed cue.  Moreover,from the fiscal point of view there is a good deal to be said for a terminable and diminishing subsidy rather than for aremission of excise for an indefinite period, which would beregarded as permanent, and would, therefore, not provide thesame incentive to the industry to become independent ofState support.          One of the objections to a subsidy which may beraised is that there is a possibility that an exceptionallyefficient factory might be able to make substantial profitsduring the period of Government assistance.  Having regard tothe peculiar difficulties which have to be overcome in theearly stages of the development of the beet sugar industry,we think this possibility too remote to  justify the inclusionof any condition as to limitation of profits in the scheme ofassistance.  We desire, however, to place on record in thisconnection that Lord Ifeir has  informed us that personallyhe would have no objection to  some such condition beingattached to the subsidy,24.          Finally we were  instructed to report on thepossible effects of the immediate extension of the industry&apos;in providing substantial employment.  If our recommendations are accepted we have reason to believe that at least six new factories-will be put  in hand at once.  Each ncW factorywould cost afe least  200,000,  of which  150,000 would represent the cost of plant and machinery.  A considerable
amount of work would be provided, therefore, for theengineering industry, and we were Informed that the whole ofthe machinery required could be supplied by british manufacturers,  practically all the machinery for the new factory at Colwlck Is being supplied from Glasgow,  Eachfactory would employ 5(X - 600 men at good wages during the manufacturing season from October to January.  The wages paid at Kelham last winter were 1/3 per hour, and the factoryabsorbed all the casual unemployed labour in the district.In addition each factory would employ SO - 60 men all the yearround.  The growing of beet for six new factories wouldrequire an additional area of 24,000 acres in the first year,and as  it Is generally agreed that each ten acres of beetrequires an additional man, employment would be provided for ,400 more men on the land,  Moreover, additional labour would be required to satisfy the  increased demand for transport facilities whioh would arise with the development of theindustry.  The beet must be taken to the factory and the pulpand other by-products returned to the farms.  One ton of coal and half a ton of limestone must be brought to the  factoryfor every ten tons of beet worked,          ffe are satisfied, therefore, that our proposals would have a material result In  providing additional employment on the land,  in the factories and  in some of thetrades  which are most hardly hit.  Lord Weir,  in fact, statedthat he knew  of no scheme that would have a more  immediate effect  in relieving  unemployment  than the establishment ofthe sugar beet  industry  in this  country and he regards It asparticularly  valuable  to the engineering trade.25.           In conclusion we may  summarise our findings asfollows      (a)      &apos;.?e are  satisfied that  the  Industry will not&apos;          continue  or  develop without further help.      (b)     We think  that  assistance at the  rate  of 19/6          per cwt.  of  sugar  is necessary at the outset,
    bub that if this is given the industry can    afford to pay excise duty.(c)      We consider that assistance is necessary    for ten years, but that after the first four    years the subsidy could be reduced to 13/- per    cwt, and after a further three years to 6/6    per cwt.(&amp;)      We recoinmend that the assistance suggested    above should be given by means of a direct    subsidy per cwt, of sugar produced, coupled    with a condition that the factory should pay    the growers of beet a minimum price of 44/-    per ton of beet during the first four years,    with an additional amount for a three years    contract,(e)      We believe that these proposals will    secure the immediate establishment of at    least six new factories, which will provide    additional employment for 2,400 more men on    the land, for 3,600 men in the factories in   -the winter months and for the considerable    number required for the erection of the    factories and the provision.of the necessary    machinery.(f)      The net cost of these proposals in the    current financial year will probably not exceed     180,000, which might rise to  300,000 in    1925,-26 and  500,000 in 1926-27 if six new    factories are put in hand at once.          We have the honour to be,                     Sir,  .                        Your obedient Servants,                (SgdJ.      FJ..C. FLOuD,                            ROBERT B.
