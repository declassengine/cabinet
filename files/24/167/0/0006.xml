FOITC IIII8JI REPORT OHTEUKE E.L.3&apos; reconstruction^IisfSuCTloF POLICY.      In pursuance  of Cabinet  18  (24)  Conclusion 4 (18),the Unemployment Committee  have  recently  examined theproposals contained  in Memoranda submitted to them by the                        theMinister of Transport for/initiation  of the new policy of    - ,&apos;C;:-i                      &apos; i&quot;j :                     !-Uj&apos;j:--.&quot;-reconstruction of certain main trunk  roads in the country at the sole cost of  the Road  Fund.  The reasons  for and nature of this policy are more particularly indicated inthe following paragraphs.   It has been represented to theCommittee that reliance can no longer be placer]  on highway authorities whose resources and  energies have all been heavily taxed during the past 3^- years in the execution of road works usually on terras that the cost is shared by theRoad Fund and local Rates.   Moreover, it is very  doubtfulwhether the Local Authorities have adequate staff to under-take a new and extensive system  of road works.    It is accordingly proposed that the Government should assume responsibility for the reconstruction of a category of roads to be termed &quot;Main-Trunk Roads&quot;, including in thefirst place about 2,000 miles of principal Highway,such asthe Dover - London- Edinburgh and London - Plymouth roads.                                                  traffic the progressive adaptation  of theso roads to  modern/conditionsbeing accepted as a State charge,with the exclusion of the sections through urban areas.
                                              and      The strengthening., wl&amp;ening^-improvement., /re-alignment of these Main  Trunk Eoada  with  the construction of necessary bye-passes  oould  then be undertaken on a wholesale scale either by the  direct action  of  the Government or by an arrangement with  the County  Councils, provided that the latter would agree to set  up a  special staff for the purpose, so as not to slacken the progress of work for which they have already buagetted.     The  result would be that during the period of reconstruction and possibly  for the &quot;Maintenance period&quot; afterwards, Highway Authorities would be relieved of the burden of maintaining certain sections of the main trunk roads and should therefore,  in fairness,  accept as a charge against their ratepayers during this period, the average annual sum which they had  expended on maintaining these sections  during the few preceding years.     The  Committee have reason to believe that the new polioy will be popular with motorists and with highway authorities.  On the assumption that the   5,000,000 programme is contemplated, of which possibly  1,000,000 could be expended  in 1924/25,  employment would be  provided  during that year for about 4,500 men.    The Minister of Transport is advised that action within the limits  contemplated  by him would fall within his existing powers and that no  further legislation would be necessary.   At the same time  the adoption  of the proposed new policy will  certainly tend  to strengthen the pressure which,is already  being exarted in the direction of transferring the whole burden of  the\mainte-nance of the main trunk roads of the  country to National\funds.To introduce a system of Trunk Roads  wholly maintained out o/fc&quot;National Funds would  involve control  and  administration  &apos;.*
fey a Central  apartment, and for this  legisla^tion would to aeoeseary.     Ihe Comroittae have considered the sourcesfrom which the  5,000,000 required to finance the new policy should be derived.   Havingregard to the recent decision of the Cabinet(Cabinet 30 (24) Conclusion ? (a) ), that thefuture revenues of the Koad Fund ere not atpresent to be anticipated to any greater extantthan is entailed by the new  13,500,000 programme,the Committee are of opinion that the bastcourse to adopt will be to defer, for&apos;thetime being, the construction of the HorthOrbital Boad (which formed one of the items of the new programme and acco anted for 5,000,000), and to ear-mark the  5,000,000so if el eased for the purposes of the new MainSrunk Hoad Beooaetruetion policy.
In submitting too follxming-reeojimendaitions tothe Cabinet the Unemployment Committee desire to pointout that the proposals constitute a grave departure from the policy hitherto adopted by the Ministry ofTransport and indeed from the policy of successiveadministrations governing the general relations betweennational and local finances.       The Committee recommend to the Cabinet:-         (l)  That the Minister of Transport should              be authorised to initiate a new policy              under which the reconstruction of              certain main trunk roads will be              undertaken at. the sole expense of              the Road Fund.   Such reconstruction              tovolving the maintenance of the roads              from the Fund during construction              and for a short guaranteed period              thereafter.         (2)  That the Minister of Transport should              be further authorised to allocate the              sum of  5,000,000 out of the additional               13,500,000 new programme for Trunk Road              reconstruction etc. purposes, the  5,000,000              in question, being provided by the temporary            !  postponement of the construction of the              north Orbital Road.   At the same time it              Should be understood that the North Orbital              Road Scheme  is not dropped;  on the              bcntrary the Minister of Transport should  *              be authorised, with the concurrence of the              treasury, to acquire from time to time land              it a few point where impending building              Operations threaten the course of the road              and that the Local Authorities concerned              Should be encouraged to include the road              In their town planning schemes.         (3)v That the arrangements to be concluded              between the Minister of Transport and              ihe Local Authorities should, inter              frlia,  comprise the acceptance by the              Local Authority as a charge against their              Ratepayers during the &quot;period of re-              construction&quot; of the average annual, sum              expended by the&apos;authority on maintaining              ihe road sections under reconstruction             ^iuring the few years preceding.
