MEMORANEOM BY THB MINISTER OF HEALTH.               The late Government introduced Bills In the House of     Lords in 1922 and 1923 for further measures to deal with the     smoke nuisance,.   The Bills were based partly on recommendations     made by a Departmental committee, presided over by Lord Newton,     which reported in December, 1921,               I recently saw a deputation from the coal Smoke Abatement     Society which urged the introduction of a Bill, and I suggest     that such a 31U should be Introduced In the House of Lords.               Conferences have been held with representatives of the     Coal Smoke Abatement Society and of - manufacturers, and the pro-     gress of the Bill will necessarily depend on the measure of agree-     raant between the various interests concerned, and on the extent to     which Parliamentary time is available.               A draft of the proposed Bill is annexed,   its main pro-     posala are that proceedings can be taken In respect of any smoke     whi^h ia a nuisance and not simply, ae at present, In respect of     black smoke;  that power is given to Local Authorities to fix     standards for the emission of black smoke (the fixing of standards     for other smoke is not at present practicable);  that powers are     given to County Councils to act in default of Authorities within     their area other than County Borough Councils;  that Local     Authorities are. empowered to make byelaws requiring the provision     in new buildings, other than private  dwelling houses,  of such     arrangements for heating as are calculated to prevent or reduce     the emission of smoke;   and that provision is made for the  ex-     tension of the Alkali Act to new processes similar to  those  to     which the present Act appllea.               The Authority of the Cabinet is desired for  the intro-     duction of the Bill.                              (Intd.)  J.W.     28th May, 1924.
