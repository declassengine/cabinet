[This  Document is the  Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government. 1    J $ l\Printed for the Cabinet.SECRET.CP. 323 (24).                                CABINET.                   PROMOTION  OP EMPIRE TRADE.         MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY  OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES.    IN connection with the suggestion for an enquiry on Imperial Trade, referredto in Conclusion (6) of the Cabinet Meeting on the 15th May, I should like tobring the following considerations to the notice of my colleagues:     I  have  had  considerable evidence of the, disappointment  caused  in  theDominions and  Colonies by  the abandonment of the Preference proposals  putforward at the Imperial Economic Conference and of the possible reactions on thetrade of this country, and I should be glad, if  possible, to take some step in orderto counteract that disappointment and prevent those&apos; reactions.    Prom our own point of view also it would be of advantage if we could initiatesome action which would be a practical proof  of our interest  in the developmentof Imperial trade by means  other than fiscal  preference.  It will be rememberedthat, in the course of the Budget Debate, Sir  Robert Home challenged us on thispoint.  (See &quot; Hansard,&quot; 30th April, columns 1694-1699.)    On the whole, I am inclined  to  think  that it would be well to revive, withcertain modifications, the project  for an Imperial Economic Committee made atthe Economic Conference of  1923.  It will be remembered that our chief reasonfor deciding  at  first  not to  proceed  with this Committee was the want  ofunanimity at  the Conference, i.e., the opposition of Canada.  (See my memorandumOP. 97 (24),  Cabinet Conclusion 14 (24), 8, and &quot; Hansard,&quot; 25th April,  1924.)    If, however, it  were decided  that we should give the  Committee a  definitereference upon which  to start, if  that  reference made it  perfectly  clear that questions  of  Tariff Policy were  excluded, and  if, further,  there were  a clear understanding  that the question  of  continuing the  Committee  in being  orentrusting further investigations  to a similar Committee would be decided by theGovernments of the Empire in the light of the experience gained in the course ofthe first  investigations, then I should hope  that Canada, as well as the  otherDominions, would participate in the work of the Committee.    I  therefore  suggest  to  my colleagues that  it is advisable  to propose  theestablishment of a Committee  consisting of the following  representatives  (asproposed  at the Imperial Econfomic Conference), viz.:                                                               Members.        Great Britain  ....      ....      ....      ....      ....      ....  4        Dominions (each)      ....      ....      ....      ....      ....  2        India............................2        Colonies and Protectorates       ...      ....      ....      ....  2for the specific purpose of reporting as soon as possible on the following terms ofreference:         &quot; To consider the possibility of improving the methods of preparing  for    market, and marketing within the United Kingdom, the food products of the    oversea parts of the Empire,  with  a view to  increasing the consumption  of    such products in the United Kingdom  and promoting the interests both  of    producers and consumers.&quot;    The terms of reference have been framed in this particular way-first, becausethe question  of methods of  marketing  was  discussed to some extent at theImperial Economic  Conference; secondly, because I am advised  that this line  ofenquiry is to a large extent new and  offers real prospects of results.      [11635]                                                   \j
    I should propose, in communicating this proposal to the other  Governmentsconcerned, to say that we contemplate that the Committee should concentrate itsattention first on meat and fruit.   It would be also well to intimate that at  theconclusion of the enquiry into the marketing of food products we should proposeto consider, in  consultation with the other Governments, whether other kindredmatters might not with advantage be referred to this or a similar Committee.    If my colleagues agree that action on  the lines  which I have indicated isdesirable, I will take steps to sound  the Dominion Governments at once, as  theestablishment of the Committee would be contingent on their attitude.   If thereis no time to obtain replies before the House of Commons&apos; Debate on the Preferenceproposals, we could at least announce our intended policy, and  say that we wereconsulting the Dominions upon it.    I have consulted  the  President  of the Board of Trade, who agrees with  theabove proposals.  I may add that I think it would  be desirable to announce that,so  far  as  His Majesty&apos;s Government  are  concerned,  the choice  of  the fourrepresentatives  of  Great  Britain would be made without reference to their political views.&apos;,;  !J;:   &apos; ;  &apos; ;                                                     J.
