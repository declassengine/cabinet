OOUHBHT  IS  THE  PROPERTY  OF  HIS  BRITAKMC MAJESTY&apos;S  GOVERNMENT.            0 A B I S E I,&apos;MEMORANDUM   BY   THE   MINISTER  OF  LABOUR.         UNEMPLOYED EX-OFPltJERS.     The Committee whioh  recently  considered  the  claims of professional ex-Ranker Officers, included  in  their recommendations the following         &quot;31.  We have more  than onoe referred               above to the  oases  of hardship whioh               still prevail among men who have  held               His Majesty^ Commission and who   rendered               distinguished service to.their oountry in               the Great War.   We recommend  that His               majesty&apos;s Government should make renewed               appeal to employers of labour  to give the               most sympathetic! consideration to  the olaims               of all these  ex-offioers for suitable               employment.&quot;This question was considered by the Cabinet on the 16thMay, when I was asked to make myself responsible for givingeffeot to this recommendation.   (See Cabinet Conclusion32 (24) 12 (b)).     The duty of assisting ex-offioers and ex-service menof other ranks with similar educational qualifioationa in finding employment belongs to the Appointments Departmentof the Ministry of Labour.   No distinotion has hitherto been made between ex-offioers and  ex-servioe men of other ranks of similar education, and I consider it advisable tomaintain this praotioe.     The Appointments Department has always been&apos; assisted by panels of professional and business men, who endeavourto find vacancies, and who interview all applicants  forappointments.      The officers&apos; Association also oo-operate and all of this voluntary work is co-ordinated under aNational Appointments committee, representing the voluntarypanels and the Officers&apos;  Association.   I have consulted                                                    /the
                                                         ^ 0 ft                      s, the Hational  Appointments  committee  as  to  the  beet method of giving  affeet  to  the  above-quoted recommendation  ef the Ex-Rankers committee,  and was  advised  that the best way to launch the appeal would be  for me to write a  letter to all the London and Provincial daily  papers,  and to address a letter  to  the  central association of Chambers of Commerce.   I therefore  addressed  a letter to the  Press, appealing te  employers for their vacancies, and this letter was published in  a large number of papers both in London and the provinces on the 18th June.     Acting en the advloe of the national Appointments Committee, I have confined the appeal to those  ex-offioers and men of similar oducation who are  registered with the appointments Department.  This means  that it  applies only to those who have had no opportunity  of resettling in permanent employment since their war  servioe, and excludes those who have had suoh an opportunity and have elnoe lest it through other  causes.  This course was neoessary aa the voluntary panels,  whose assistance is essential if results are to be obtained,  are not prepared  to deal with the oaBes of ex-offloors who are unemployed through causes notconnected with their war servioe.     I feel that  if.appointments can be found for the2,560 applicants  registered with the Appointments Department, the most pressing problem will have been solved.     I propose to follow up this appeal through the pressby an appeal direct to the Chambers of Commerce and to other organisations of  employers.                                (intd.) T.  S.Ministry of Labour. So th&quot; June, 19&amp;4.  *&quot;
