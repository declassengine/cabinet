Proposed Bill to deal with road-side tree planting             and experimental work in connection with the user, construe-             tion, maintenance and improvement of  roads and bridges.Further Memorandum by the Minister of Transport.     1.  At their meeting on the Soth May, the Cabinet had under consideration my earlier Memorandum, seeking authorityto introduce a short Bill dealing with a few uncontroversialmatters, of which the most important and urgent are  (i)    To give powers to the Minister of Transport and to           highway authorities to incur expenditure in the           planting and maintenance of trees or shrubs by &apos;           the side of highways;  (ii)   To give power to the Minister of Transport to incur           expenditure from the Road Fund on experimental           work.         The Cabinet referred the matter back, and asked thatI should make further inquiries as to whether these objectscould not be obtained without legislation.     2.  I have now considered the matter again very carefullyand am satisfied that nothing effective oan be done In either of the two directions indicated above without legislation.     3.  Tree-planting. As I have already explained in myearlier Memorandum, under the existing law It is only urbanauthorities who are empowered to plant trees by the roadside,and no suoh general powers are possessed either by the Ministerof Transport or &quot;by County Councils.  I am constantly being pressed in the House of-Commons at Question time by members ofthe Opposition, to state when steps will be taken to obtainadditional powers in connection with tree planting.  The useof a small amount of money to provide roads that are beautifulas well as useful is clearly consistent with a labour policy,and I do not think that opposition from any quarter need be feared.  The pressure on the Minister of Transport to take
9-1 *1st Julyy 1924.(Initialled)  H.G.definite action in this connection will increase as additionallengths Of the new arterial roads are opened for traffic withtheir long and hare wastes of roadside verge.     4.  As regards Experimental Work, reference was made  atthe Cabinet meeting to experiments which are carried out byhighway authorities, and in particular to the experiment withrubber blocks in the neighbourhood&apos; of the Cenotaph.  Unfortunately,this piece of work is an excellent illustration of the disadvantages of carrying out an important experiment of this nature under such conditions.  Success cannot be anticipatedat the first attempt, and the constant tinkering with the  road-way in the neighbourhood of the cenotaph has been a nuisanceto traffic and has detracted very largely from the value of the experiment.  Indeed, the conditions have been so unsatisfactorythat I understand that arrangements have been made for theremoval of the blocks.         In view of the large sums now expended, on highways,I am anxious to obtain powers to incur expenditure from theRoad Fund on experimental work, which could be carried out underproper conditions and earefu.l observation.     5.  i wish therefore to seek tho Cabinet1s authority  tointroduce a short Bill as described in my previous memorandum,which I believe would be entirely uncontentious.
