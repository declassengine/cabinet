Memorandum on proposed Inquiry into Industry               and Trade.     With regard to the proposed Committee to inquire into industry and Trade, the following terms of reference have beensuggested: -           &quot;To inquire into and report upon the conditions and      prospects of British industry and oommsroe,  with special      reference to the export trade, and to make reoomnendations      in regard thereto&quot;.     It has  further been suggested that the scope  of the terms ofreference should be on the general lines set out in the  threefollowing paragraphs and that these should be published  at the sametime as the  terms of reference with an intimation  that they are ..intended as  explanatory of the subjects on which investigation is specially desired and not as an exhaustive definition of the &apos;&quot;&apos;inquiry:-          &quot;The fundamental question to whioh the attention of  the     Committee should be  directed is the present position of     British overseas trade and the prospect of  British  partioipa-      tion in the markets  of the world being such  as  to  ensure     sufficient and continuous employment  and a  satisfactory     standard of living In this country.    The examination of     tendencies and developments in the markets  of the world and     also in the chief oompeting countries  will  be  involved     together with an inquiry into the  growth of competition with     British  goods in these  markets,  the  likelihood  of  its     continuance,  and its  probable  consequences.          The  second question is  the ability  of  British  industry     to meet  competition under the  conditions thus determined     and to.  adapt  itself to changes  in the  nature  of overseas     demand.   This  involves an inquiry into British productive     capacity and organisation,  including the supply and     efficiency of labour  and management, the present and future                                                       adequacy/
 adequacy of raw.materials  and possible Improvements in their utilisation, and  the  part  played by the United Kingdom in new developments  of industry, particularly those which are the outcome of scientific  research.  Matters to which attention might be directed are the  present extent of large scale pro- duction, its possibilities and limitations; the efficiency of plant and equipment;  power supply and transport as factors in cost of production; marketing organisation at home and abroad; and the current methods of industrial and commercial finance. It will be necessary, in addition, tc take account of the effect of State regulative action upon costs and output.      The third question is that of the relations between those engaged in  production.  This will involve inquiry into methods of industrial remuneration, the main causes of unrest and disputes, and the methods of avoidance or settlement of disputes, as, for example, co-partnership, co-operation, Wages Boards and voluntary arbitration, State regulation of wages, and compulsory arbitration and compulsory enforcement and extension of agreements&quot;.
