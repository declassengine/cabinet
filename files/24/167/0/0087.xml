DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY  OF HIS BRITANNIC  MAJESTY * S  GOVERNMENT.                         CABINET.54(24)                  SEVERN TIDAL POWER INQUIRY.       Memorandum by tho President of the Board of Trade                 and tho Minister of Transport.1.  The Water Power Resources Committee in their ThirdInterim Report (Tidal Power), dated December 1st, 1920, drew attention to the desirability of investigating the possibilityfrom a oommeroial standpoint of utilising the tides for motivepower purposes, and reoommended that a Technical commission should be appointed to conduct such an Inquiry with particular reference to the Severn, since, on aocount of the large tidalamplitude in that Estuary and the general suitability of the adjoining district, this might almost be regarded as a testcase.  The Water Power Resources Committee referred to the magnitude and great possibilities of industrial developmentinherent in a tidal power scheme for the Severn, if it couldbe proved to be a practicable commercial proposition.  Twopreliminary schemes worked out in some detail were submitted toand considered by the Committee who, themselves, undertook aseparate check examination on the basis of suoh data as wereavailable.  In the result, they found that,  while on theinformation before them they were not in a positiondefinitely to recommend a scheme, there was ample justification for a further and more detailed inquiry into a number ofdiffioult technical and eoonomio problems (set out as an annex to this Memorandum) whioh would require carefulconsideration.2.  The economy oampaign was responsible for the postponement of the consideration of the Committee&apos;s proposals,  butrecently they have beon under review (partly in connexionwith the question of providing work for the relief of                           -1-
unemployment), and the President of the Board of Trade askeda small Informal Committee consisting of Sir John Snell(Chairman of the electricity Commissioners), ProfessorA.H.Cdbson (Professor of Engineering in the University of manchester) and Mr.maurice Wilson, a distinguished engineer,to advise as to tho nature and scope of the enquiries whiohshould be undertaken, and their probable oost.   Their report has now been received and is oiroulated herewith.  A Summaryof the proposals is contained in paragraphs 32 to 35.3.  The Committee propose that the enquiries should beoonduoted in two stages:-    Stage 1 would comprise the carrying out of a defined           scheme of survey and investigation, whioh would           provide the basic datev. re quired, and enable           the Government to arrive at a conclusion as to           (a) the practicability of a barrage (which involves           the fundamental,question of the existence of           suitable foundations) and (b) its possible effects           on othor interests in the river, especially           navigation, but including also land drainage and           fisheries.  The oost of this part&apos;of the enquiry           is estimated at between  60,000 and  80,000, and           the minimum period at two years, but this would be           lengthened if it were decided to investigate and           settle the oruoial question of foundations before           taking any aotion in regard to the other surveys.           For the investigations as to foundations a sum of           up to  10,000 must be allowed: this is included in           the figure given above.    Stago 2 would oomprise the preparation of a preliminary           power scheme, based on the data so obtained, should           they be favourable.  The oost of this stage is           estimated at  10,000 and the period at one year.    In addition, it would bo necessary to make an allowance
 (say about  5,000) for fees  to be paid  to  the Commission, who olearly would have to be engineers of repute.  The possible cost Is thus from  75,000 to  95,000, and  the minimum total time whioh would be required is three years.4.  In addition to the engineering inquiry, which alone was oonsidered by the Informal Committee, it would be necessary to conduct an inquiry into the  numerous eoonomio problems involved including the effeot of a barrage upon  navigation, eto. whichwould have to be oonsidered  in the light of the data collected in stage (l) above, and the  extent to whioh any adverse effectsin this respeot might be counterbalanced,  to the general interests of the community,  by the industrial developmentsconsequent upon the establishment of a  large-scale power plant.This inquiry would naturally precede stage (2). &apos; The questionwhether the undertaking, if  technically and commerciallyfeasible should be carried out by tho State, by PrivateEnterprise or by a mixed Body would not arise initially,but this question, and the attendant one as to whether theState,  if it oarried out the works, should take steps toseoure to itself any possible increase  in  local land values,would fall within the soope  of the eoonoraio inquiry.   Thispart of the Inquiry should not, however, be costly.5.  It is clear that the scheme, if practicable, cannotbe  used to alleviate unemployment existing at present orin the near future, but the  matter is one of greatimportance from the points of view of coal conservationand the development of natural resources.  In view of the magnitude and character of the undertaking, if found to be feasible,and the fact that its cost would probably notbe less than  30,000,000 it  may be that no private group would take It up without some form of state assistance,  and in any event the interests affected are so great,  and tho effects likoly to be so far-reaching, that no soheme could
                                           S. W.                                 (Intld.)                                           H. G.7 th July, 1924.proceed, or should be allowed to do so, without Governmentapproval.   That being so, the collection of data which will put the Government in a position to consider schemes submitted by private enterprise, or to frame a scheme ofits own, is essential, and the cost of such collection is relatively small.   Further, the estimate includes expenditure to be incurred by the Hydrographer&apos;s Department of theNavy and by the Ordnance Survey, and, if these Departmentssimply postponed part of their normal work, the Board ofTrade Vote would be swollen, but the Votes of otherDepartments would be lessened to some appreciable extent,so that the net cost of the surveys would be reducedappreciably below the figures given.6.   The setting up of a Commission might possibly involve legislation in regard to one matter.   The ordnance SurveyDepartment would probably experience no obstruction incarrying out the land surveys,  but landowners might objectto the sinking of boreholes and trial pits.   failing agreement as to terms,  It might be necessary to provide fora statutory right to carry out these investigations.7.   We now ask for a decision as to          (a) Whether a Commission should now be constituted                to conduct investigations on the lines                indicated in the Informal Committee&apos;s Report:                and if so,          (b) Whether the investigation as to the existence                of suitable foundations for a barrage should                precede the other investigations and  surveys                proposed.   (This would involve the delay                of the  Commission^ final pronouncement on                the scheme as a whole),

The utilisation of tidal power involves the solutionof many complex problems, and though we are of the opinionthat a prima facie oase has been made out for the Severn scheme,it must be pointed out that, before a final pronouncement ispossible,  a further investigation of a number of physical andtechnical questions, some of general interest and some peculiar to the conditions of the Severn, requires to be made.    Amongthese questions we may mention the following:-     Phys iographloal:-        1.

BOARD  OP  TRADE.          REPORT OF THE SEVERN TIDAL POWER (INFORMAL) COMMITTEE.To the Right Hon. Sidney Webb, M.P.   President of the Board of Trade.     Sir,  1.      We were appointed as an Informal Committee without     speoifio terms of reference, but we have been informed by     Mr, Ashley that the Board of Trade aro seeking advice as to     the oharaoter and scope of the investigations whioh would be     necessary to oarry to a conclusion the Inquiry into the     subject of Tidal Power suggested by the Water Power     Resources Committee, the nature of the body which would be     required to undertake the work and Its probable manner of     procedure, and also the approximate expenditure which would     be entailed.  2,      The Water Power Resources Committee stated their     conclusions on the subject of Tidal Power in their Third     Interim Report, whioh is attached as an Appendix to this     Report.  Briefly, that Committee, after examining two tidal     power&apos; schemes for utilising the Severn which had been     submitted to them, themselves undertook a separate check     examination.   They found that, owing to the novel oharaoter     of the tidal power problem,  manufacturers and designers whom     they approached were unable  to express final and definite     opinions on the various questions addressed to them,  and in     consequence the Committee&apos;s  estimates were unavoidably     tentative in character (Sec. 5 of Report).  Nevertheless,  the     results of the investigations were thought to be sufficiently     promising to warrant the conclusion that,  subject to  tho     satisfactory solution of a number of physical and technical     questions (the chief of which are outlined in Sec.  8  of  the
   Report), a prima facie case had been made out for utilising   the Severn tides for power purposes.  We have accepted the   Committee&apos;s conclusions and have not attempted to check in   any way the results of their inquiry:-3.      The nature of the problem of harnessing the tides is   briefly outlined in Seotions 1? to 20 of the Report referred   to above.  We have assumed that the scheme adopted   for the Severn would comprise (a) a single barrage across   the Severn provided with turbines operated by the tide,   and (b) a high-level water storage reservoir for supplying   water to a seoondary set of turbines.  The output from   the barrage turbines would be intermittent and variable   according to the state of the tide; at timeB of maximum   output a portion of the energy generated would be used to   elevate water into the high-level reservoir, and the water   thus raised would be used in the secondary set of turbines   to supply energy during the periods when,  owing to tidal   conditions, the barrage turbines were either idle or   generating an output less than the demand.4.      Evidently, any Body appointed to undertake the Inquiry   would first have to obtain acourate basic data in order   (a) to enable them to estimate the amount of power available,   to decide upon the best scheme for its development and to   determine whether it would be possible to carry out the   necessary works on an economic basis, and also (b) to   permit of their investigating with some precision the   possible effect of the works on interests already   established in the river.6.      We have reviewed the data whioh are already available,   and we have discussed oertaln questions relative to the   survey and investigatory work which we consider necessary   with Officers who, at our request,  were nominated by
   Departments  which we thought might he  able  to assist in   work of this description.   These representatives were as   follows:-     Vice Admiral F.C.Learmonth,C.B.,C.B.E., )  representing                 Hydrographer  of  the Navy   )     the     Mr. L.H,Savile, Civil Engineer in  Chief.)  Admiralty.     Lt .-:Col.Craster,0.B.E.,R,E.,  representing the Ordnance                                       Survey  Department.     Mr. E.Dixon, representing the Geological  Survey.        In addition, Mr. T,Shirley Hawkins, M.B.E., nominated   by the Ministry of Transport,  explained  to  us the principal   features  of  the Severn Tidal Power Scheme evolved by the   Ministry in  1920.  We are greatly indebted  to the Departments   concerned, and in particular to these  Officers, for the very   valuable assistance which they gave  us and  the  speed with   which they dealt with our enquiries .6.      Among the data reviewed,  we desire  to  dra?/ attention to   the existence of a detailed,,survey of  the Severn Estuary made   by Captain Beechey, in 1849, the particulars of which are in   the possession of the Admiralty. This work is  undoubtedly of   great Interest and, although on account  of  its  age it cannot   be accepted  as showing the  present conditions in the Estuary,   it would be  of great value  as-a basis  of comparison in   connection with the projected  enquiry.7.      Considerable opposition to any  scheme  is to be   anticipated  from the established interests,  and the con-   ciliation of such opponents would necessitate the production   of the most  convincing evidence that it would not be   seriously detrimental to them.    We  consider that the   Investigation of the possible effects  of erecting a barrage   in the Estuary is  the most important preliminary step
which would have to he undertaken.    We have,  therefore,included in our statement of the information requireddata which would not he necessary for the preparation  of ascheme if it were considered purely as a tidal power pro-jeot,but which are essential to enable the effect on other interests to be gauged and, if necessary,  the schemeto be modified with the object of eliminating  or minimising&apos;any undesirable results which might follow on  its beingcarried out.     The three chief interests in the Severn,  at present,are as follows:-     (a) The Navigation Interest.-   This interest would          certainly object to the erection of  a barrage          on the grounds that, by interfering  with the          scouring effect of the natural flow, it would          cause silting both above  and below the barrage          and modifications of the  bed and banks of the          river which would be detrimental to  navigation and          harmful to existing port  and harbour authorities.          Possibly this objection would be urged most          strongly by ports below the site of  the barrage,          as it might be the case that authorities oon-          cerned with navigation conditions above would          arrive at the conclusion  that the maintenance          above the barrage of a higher low-water level          than exists at present would be to their advantage.     (b) The Riparian Interest.- While the highest level          attained by the water above the barrage on any          tide would be less than that under natural con-          ditions, It Is conceivable that the  holding-up          of the water (for the period necessary to establish          the head between it and the receding tide which          is required to operate the turbines) might have          the effect of backing-up  the water along the          Estuary and the tributaries, streams and drains          flowing into it.   This possibility  would lead to          objections from the owners of land and other          property in the area concerned, that they would          experience damage due to  flooding, and they  might          also contend that the barrage would  retard the          drainage of flood water after periods  of heavy          rainfall.-     (c) The Fisheries Interest.-  The Severn  and the  Wye          are admittedly important  salmon rivers, and  strong          objection may be expected from the Fisheries          Interest.
                                                       ll 3 9                                                       a t* &amp;1 9.     Of these interests, the last Is probably the least    important. The financial value of the fisheries in    relation to that of a tidal power scheme  (if one were    shown to be economically practicable) would be small,    and objection from this interest could hardly be regarded    as fundamental in character.  It would be necessary to    make such provision as might be possible for preventing    damage to the salmon fisheries, or alternatively to    compensate the owners if damage could not be prevented.    The other interests, and particularly that of navigation,    are of greater importance.  The effect of a barrage on    these interests could only be determined after a complete    hydrographic survey of the portion of the Estuary concerned    and a number of Investigations have been effected to    provide the basic data required,10,      The scheme of survey and investigation which we    propose should be undertaken in respect of the civil    engineering aspect of the Inquiry may be divided into    five main sections:-         (a) Marine Survey.         (b) Land Survey,         (c) Collection of Data and Special Investigations,         (d) Experimental Determination of Possible Effect               of Barrage on the Tidal Cycle,  and on               Navigation Interests (siltation and               modification of bed of estuary) and Riparian               Interests (flooding of land and interference               with drainage).         (e) Detailed Examination of Foundations at Sites               proposed for Barrage and for Dam of High-level               Reservoir.11.      The Marine Survey would comprise:-              (1) Cross sections of the  River  bed from  bank
                                                 4&apos;34to bank and carried say 300 feet inland on each sideof the river, the sections to commence below theproposed barrage and to be taken at intervals of say2,000 feet as far up as the water will be held backby the barrage.  If and when required, the  sectionswould be taken at closer intervals.     (2) Current observations in the neighbourhoodof the proposed barrage, and extending for say onemile below the same.  These should be taken by meansof floats, so that the force and direction of the &apos;currents may be plotted.  They should be taken at various periods of the flood and ebb tides and atsprings and neaps.     (3) Observations by current meters across theriver near the site of the proposed barrage so as toobtain a check estimate of the tidal water.     (4) Measurements of fresh water discharge.     (5) Simultaneous readings of tide gauges atsay, site of barrage, and at other places to be selected up the river.  The readings should be takencontinuously during the day and, if possible, duringthe night also, for 15 days and should be repeatedsay once a quarter.     (6) An automatic self-recording tide gauge shouldbe set up near the site of the proposed barrage.Another might be required at a higher point along theEstuary,     (7) Samples of water should be taken from differentplaces, both above and below the barrage, in order toenable the amount of matter in suspension to be ascer-tained.  They should be taken periodically, say at springsand neaps both on flood and ebb during the time of
the Investigation, and also at times of land floods,and they should be drawn from different depthB and at various states of the tide.surreys and the obtaining of information as follows:-        (l) A general survey of the whole area starting    from below the proposed barrage and extending up the river    as far as the  water will be Immediately affeoted by the    barrage (say Glouoester).   The survey should extend on    either side of the river as far as the 50 ft. contour line.    It would probably be sufficient for the purpose if the    ground were gone over with the six-Inch Ordnance sheets    upon which any obviouB and necessary corrections would    be made,        (2)  General  check levels over  the area in question,    with oross sections where  required.

(7) Levels and  distances  to  which the  streams and    drains now back up  during  high water  periods underAreas liable to flooding should be defined.    (8) State of river banks and frontages generally,with details and particulars of any works whiohare in bad oondition and likely  to be injuriouslyaffeoted by the prolongation of the high water period.The Land Survey  would comprise the oarrying out of(a)  ordinary(b)  under.fl.ry weather conditions;flood conditions.
          (9) Particulars of all sewage discharges.     Nature of effluent, period over which discharge     takes place, etc.        (10) Investigation of sites suitable for     proposed high level reservoir and turbine station.     This would Involve a complete and aoourate survey.     of the area of the Bite selected (inoluding cross     sections) and of the pipe line.     The collection of Data and Speoial Investigation.:would comprise the obtaining of the following particulars        (l) Geological information bearing on question.     of sites for barrage and high level reservoir.        (2) Measurement of normal and flood discharges     of streams and drains emptying into the river     within the area affected by the barrage, and also of     the River Usk.        (3) Particulars of rainfall, run-off and     related information,        (4) Estimate of quantity of land water which     will  be held up by the barrage during the high     water period and which may require  to be specially     dealt with               (a)  normally;               (b)  in times of  flood,        (5) Schedule  and particulars  of  lands and     properties whioh will  be required or Interfered     with  due  to  the  oonstruotion  of  the  works,        (6) Schedule  and particulars  of  lands and     properties which may  be affected injuriously   or     otherwise  by holding up of  the water by  the barrage.

(11) Effect of the barrage to the advantage or     detriment of such shipping.         (12) Objections which are likely to be raised     to the construction of the barrage by land owners and     public bodies above and  below the barrage.

(15) Estimate of amount of matter in suspension     which iB likely to be deposited.It will be noted that some of these investigations are matters for direct inquiryj  others would involvededuction from observed facts.  Some, notably those setout in sub-paragraphs 4,  7 and 11,  could not be completedwithout experimental work such as suggested in the succeeding paragraph.     The Experimental Determination of the Effect of aBarrage on the Tidal Cycle and on Navigation and RiparianInterests would be oarried out by means  of a scale modelof the bed and banks of the  Estuary constructed on the
basis of the information obtained in the above-mentionedsurveys and of Captain Beochey&apos;s Survey of 1849, referredto above in paragraph 6,  Such a model would afford amost valuable and practical method of examining a numberof problems relating to the building of a barrage and of assisting in the elucidation of them.  The scale of the model (which would represent the Estuary from Gloucesterto a point about 12, miles below Avonmouth, and thus wouldenable the siltation problem to be examined so far as Itmay affect the latter port) would be, horizontally, 8inches to the mile and, vertically, one inch to 10 feet,the maximum range of the miniature tide being thus about -1 inches.  River water would be admitted proportionalto the discharge of the Severn and carrying theappropriate quantity of silt, and arrangements would bemade for producing a variable tide representing toscale the variations between spring and neap tides.With  the model a cycle of tides which might in actualfact extend over many years could be reproduced in afew weeks, and the probable effect of works constructedin the water on the deposition of silt and thedistribution and movement of the deposits examined.The model could readily be modified to examine therelative advantages from these points of view of barragesrespectively at the different sites which have been proposed, and also the effect of modifying the shape and direction of the barrage and of alterations in theposition and distribution of the sluices.  It may also
be used to examine the various effects of single ordouble-way working of the turbines.  Further, theestimation of the volume of water entering and leaving the tidal basin, and the mean level, andvariation  of level at different points between the barrage and Gloucester during  a  tidal cycle, whenthe barrage is in position, could be practicallychecked only by a model of this kind.  In fact almost all the problems depending upon the magnitude anddistribution of the hydraulic flow can be examined by its use.     Such models have been constructed in the past,notably for investigating the effect of trainingwalls, etc, in the Mersey, the Seine, and the Tay,and have given excellent results.  The first wasconstructed by Professor Osborne Reynolds at the manchester University, and the others were made under his advice and supervision.  The work of designingthe apparatus required to fulfil the necessaryrequirements, of supervising the work and adjustingthe programme, of co-ordinating the variousobservations and of drawing the appropriateconclusions from, them, could only safely be entrusted to someone having considerable experience of such work, and this necessity would have to be kept inview in making the necessary arrangements.
16.      The Detailed Examination of the Foundations at the Sites   proposed for  a Barrage and for the Dam of the High Level  Reservoir.  -  Three.sites have been proposed for a barrage,   namely,  New Passage (near the Severn Tunnel), Beachley and a   position across  Oldbury Sands about two miles above Beachley,   In considering the  relative advantages of these sites, it   would be necessary  to obtain accurate cross-sections showing   the level at  which  a solid foundation is to be found, and the   nature of the rook  of which it is composed.   Where the   conditions  are suitable, the rock level may be found fairly   rapidly by  means of&quot;wash borings&quot;, that is, by sinking through   the mud or  loose sand overlying the rock by means of water-   jets, but in  order  to obtain accurate information concerning   the nature  and composition of the solid bed drilled borings   will be  necessary.  Having regard to the speed at which the   tide rises  and falls In the Estuary, and the unusual strength   of the tidal  currents, the taking of such borings would   present  exceptional difficulties, and would require special   consideration and arrangement.  Finally, trial pits would have   to be sunk  on the land at each end of the barrage site, but in   carrying out  this work and similar borings and trial pits on   the reservoir site  no special difficulties need be anticipated.17.      We  have  discussed the geological features of the Beachley   and New  Passage sites and a proposed High-level Reservoir   site with Mr. E.Dixon, of the Geological Survey, who prepared   a Report on these various sites for the Ministry of Transport   in connection with  the Severn Tidal Power Scheme prepared by   that Department, and we find that a considerable amount of   data is  available.  It will require to be supplemented in   certain  respects, but the amount of labour involved in the   purely geological aspect of the inquiry would be relatively   small.
18.      The feasibility  of  the  whole scheme turns upon the  possibility  of finding a satisfactory foundation for a barrage at  a reasonable depth.   Failure to find such foundations sufficiently  watertight and not liable to be eroded by any leakage (whioh would  cause settlement  and  dislocation of the works) would render fruit-  less  the remainder of the surveys and investigations. It is  important, therefore, that this question should be decided as soon  as possible. The Board  of Trade will doubtless consider  whether  it might not be desirable to postpone all other investigations  ttntil the existenoe of satisfactory foundations has first been  proved.  The adoption of such a course of action would, however,  delay the progress of the inquiry (if ultimately satisfactory  foundations  were  found),  and it is to be remembered that  the  marine surveys oan be efficiently and speedily performed  only  within the limits of  the summer months.  As an alternative,  there-  fore,  we suggest  that the Board might consider the desirability  of merely providing that the inquiry into the question of  foundations  shall be  commenced as soon as possible and that, in  the event of a non-successful issue,  the remainder of the surveys  and investigations shall be  discontinued.19.      When the investigations and experiments outlined in  para-  graphs 10 to 18 have  been made,  the First Stage of the Inquiry  would be complete.  It would then be  possible for the Body  appointed to carry out the Inquiry to make a Report as to the  practicability of erecting a barrage,  its probable effect on  the regulation of the water  in the Estuary,  on navigation,  on  sub-soil and other drainage,  and generally on the elements  of  the power problem.  On the basis of this  Report the Board of  Trade would  be in a position to  decide  whether the Inquiry  should prooeed or whether the effect  on existing interests was                             -21-           &apos;
                                                          U2   likely to be so great as to render impracticable a   Tidal Power project in the Severn Estuary.20.     Assuming a favourable decision were  reached, the   Second Stage might be taken in hand.  The work at this   stage would consist in producing a reasonably detailed   complete scheme with estimates.  Manufacturers and   designers would have to be approached for preliminary   designs and estimates of cost for the turbines, generators   and other machinery, and for works such as the  -barrage,   the entrance lock (for shipping), the sluice-gates and   controlling gear, the high-level reservoir dam, etc,   A certain amount of mathematical investigation also would be   required to determine the power obtainable under various   systems of working, but this Second Stage would not   involve inquiries comparable in scope with those undertaken   during the First! Stage to obtain the necessary basic data.21.     We are of opinion that the beBt method of dealing   with the Inquiry proposed by the Water Power Resources   Committee would jbe to set up a Technical Commission   consisting in-the first instance of 3 members. One of these   should be a Civil Engineer conversant with the construction   of large civil engineering works in water and able to deal   with questions relating to the survey proposed.  Another   member should be capable of supervising the construction of   and the important experiments which would have to be   made with the scale model.  When the Second Stage of the   Inquiry Is reached, it might be necessary to add to the   Commission an Hydroelectric Engineer.22,     The surveys and Investigations&apos; to be undertaken   during the First Stage of the Inquiry would necessitate   the employment of a considerable staff.   In oonneotion with this aspect of the Inquiry                             -22-                     &apos;U
   we  have had Interviews with Vice-Admlral F.C .Learmonth,  C.B.,   C.B.E., Hydrographer of the Navy,  and Lt,Col,Craster,0,B,E.,R.E.jj   who were respectively deputed by the Admiralty and the   Ordnance Survey Department to meet ua with a view to consider-   ing the extent to which these Departments could assist on a   repayment basis in the survey and other Investigatory work.   It  appeared that the Departments could carry out the bulk of   the surveys and investigations specified in paragraphs 13   to  13 above.23.     Both officers pointed out to us that If their Departments   undertook this work, it would Involve the postponement of   other work upon which they are at present engaged; and in the   case of the Ordnance Survey it was definitely stated that the   authority of His Majesty&apos;s Treasury would be necessary before   the Department could commence the land portion of the survey.24,     It may be pointed out that it would not be easy to find   a body of men possessing the experience needed for the marine   survey outside the Hydrographic Department of the Admiralty.   In  both cases, the Departments have facilities for dealing with   a large survey of the character proposed which would enable   them to carry it through speedily at a minimum expense.   Vice Admiral Learmonth and Lt. CoLCraster agreed that there   would be no difficulty in the demarcation of the work between   the two Departments.25.     We are strongly of opinion that, subject to the willing-&apos;   ness of the Admiralty and the Ordnance Survey to arrange  that   the officers and men detailed for the work shall take their   instructions directly from the Commission or a Resident
   Engineer appointed by them,  these Departments should  be   asked to assist in the carrying out of the surveys  and   investigations.  It may be stated that,  at the interview   whioh we had with tha officers, the necessity of providing   for the co-ordination of the work of the two Departments was   clearly realise! and agreed.26.     In order to oontrol and oo-ordinate the surveys  and   inquiries and to oorrelate the results,  we oonsider that it   would be essential to appoint a Resident Engineer with a   oomparatively small staff, who, during the execution  of the   survey, would be stationed in the distriot,  probably  at   Gloucester.  It would be necessary to provide him with   motor transport, as the facilities for readily reaching   any particular spot on either side of the estuary are poor.   Subsequently, it would be desirable that he should  remove  to   an offioe in London during tha preparation of the Interim   Heport.27.     Viae-Admiral learmonth  and It. Ool. Oraster each   provided us with estimates of the amount of time whioh would   be Involved in oarrying out  the work allotted to MB   Department and the estimated oost.28.     As regards the time required,  it would  be necessary   to allow a preliminary period for preparatory work  and the   ordering and delivery of instruments.   luis  should  not   exceed 3 months.  33ie aotual surveys  and investigations  in   the Estuary and on the land  might possibly be completed in   six normal summer months,  but if the  survey  were  extended   into the winter months,  the  marine portion of the survey   would be considerably lengthened.   It  is,  of oourse, possible   that observations of a minor oharaoter might be extended   beyond this period,  but we think it would  be reasonable to   assume that the main part  of the survey  (including  the bulk   of the field work)  oould be  completed within  six summer
&apos;  months.   In view  of  the  material  reduction of  expenditure  consequent  on arranging  that field  operations  shall  be undertaken  in  the  summer,  we  have assumed  that  if the Board of Trade  decided to  proceed, they would  contemplate the commencement of the survey  in March 1925, which would necessitate  the appointment  of  the  Commission  in the early  Autumn of this  year*  Under these  conditions,  the surveys might be completed by September, 1925,  and  the material  might be worked-up into  a  presentable form and the  necessary maps  and diagrams  plotted by  January,  1926.  The borings  and  trial pits  should also be completed within that period.  The construction of  the model estuary and  the  performance of  the necessary  experiments  would take  several months.  At the  earliest, therefore, It would  appear that a Report on  the First Stage of the Inquiry  (see  Paragraph 19, above),  could not be  presented before the Autumn of  1926. If the Inquiry  were proceeded, with, the Second Stage might  occupy another year.!9.     Our estimate of the cost of  the First Stage of the Inquiry  is as follows                                                                   (a) Marine survey and investigations (based on          figures supplied by Vice-Admiral          Learmonth, and assuming that the  survey          would be.  completed within six summer          months).                                         32,000     (b) Land survey and investigations (based on          figures supplied by Lt. Col. Craster).           10,000U)	Resident engineer (including staff, accommodation and motor transport) for control and co-ordination of survey work, collection of data, etc	6,000(d)	Borings and trial pits on sites of Barrage and Reservoir. It is not possible to say exactly what would be required, but it would not be advisable to allow less than	10,000*(e)	Construction and experimental operation of model estuary (based on cost of models constructed by Professor Osborne Reynolds)	2,000  60.000* This item is probably on the low side.			-25-	,!Ji
    This amount ( 60,000) should,  we consider, be regarded as a    minimum.  The investigation may reveal special difficulties    which cannot be foreseen at this stage, and weather con-    ditions may lead to an extension of the time necessary to    oomplete the marine survey which is the most costly part of    the Inquiry.  We are of opinion, however, that even under    adverse ciroumstances the First Stage of the Inquiry should    not cost more than  80,000.30.      We do not think any useful purpose would be served by    attempting to give a detailed  estimate of the cost of the    Seoond Stage (the preparation  of a preliminary design for a    power soheme from the data rendered available by the work    carried out in the First Stage), but we consider that a sum    of the order of  10,000 should be sufficient.31.      The total cost of the inquiry from the commencement to    the production of a preliminary design for a tidal power    soheme on the basis of which the necessary contract    documents . could be prepared upon which tenders oould be    invited would, therefore,  probably be from  70,000 to  90,000.    It is true that the investigations may merely serve to    reveal that the scheme is  not  economically practicable;  on    the other hand, if it is shown to be feasible,  these pre-    liminary expenses must be  regarded as small in relation to the    size and probable capital  cost* of the undertaking.                         SUMMARY.32.      We consider that for  the  purpose of carrying  out the    Inquiry into the possibility of utilising the tides in the    Severn for power purposes  which was recommended by the Water    Power Resources Committee:-              (1) A technical  Commission oonsisting of three         persons should be appointed to conduct the First                 ^Probably round about  20,000,000.                                -26-
 Stage of the Inquiry.  One member should  be an engineer conversant with large &quot;oivil engineering works in water and capable of supervising generally the necessary Burveys ana fieli. investigations; sad another should be conversant with the construction of, and experimental work with, tidal models.  For th* Seoond Stage of the Inquiry, it might he desirable to add an hydro-eleotrio engineer to the Commission.   (para 21).     (2) Ihe First Stage should comprise:         (a) the carrying out of the  surveys and investigations             required to furnish the necessary basic data             (paras. 11 to 13).         (b) tho experimental examination of the effect of a             barrage on conditions in the Estuary and the probable             effeot on navigation, riparian ani other interests.             (paras. 14 and 15).         (o) the determination of the oharaoter of the             foundations at the sites proposed for a barrage             (paras. 16 to 18) On the completion of this work, an Interim Report should be presented dealing, among other things,  with the possible effect ofa barrage on existing interests in the Estuary,  particularly onnavigation,  flooding and sub-soil and other drainage.  On thebasis of this Report,, a decision could he reached as to whethertha Inquiry should be proceeded with. (para. 19).     (3) The Seoond Stage, whioh wouia be undertaken only inthe event of a favourable decision on the Report Just referred  to,would oomprise the preparation of a reasonably detailed design(with estimates) on the basis of which the necessary oontraotdocuments could be prepared on whloh tenders for contractsmight be invited (para. 20).     (4) In order to carry out the First  Stage of the Inquiry:         (a) A Resident Engineer with a suitable staff should                           27.
   be appointed  by the  Commission.  He would,  during the execution of   the survey, reside at  Gloucester and  oontrol and be responsible   for the  co-ordination  of the surveys,  the collation of results,   the collection of data etc  Subsequently it would be desirable   that he  should remove  to an office in London during the preparation   of the Interim Report  (Para. 26).      (b) Ihe assistance  of the Hydrographer&apos;s Department of the   Admiralty and the Ordnance Survey Department should, if possible,   be secured for the necessary surveys  and inquiries in the field.   It should be  understood oloarly that,  in the event of these Depart-   mente rendering assistanoe, the officers and men loaned for the   work should act under  the direot instructions of the Odmrnioaion   and their Resident Engineer, (paras.  22 to 25).      (o) The experiments  with the model  estuary must be made under   the direct supervision  of a member of the Commission, (para. 15).      (d) A firm of high repute with special experience of boring   operations should be engaged by the Commission to oarry out the   sinking of borings and  trial pits. (Para. 16).33,     If a Commission were appointed during the early part of the   Autumn of this  yoar,tlie  earliest posiiible date upon which, the Interim                                                                       I   Report on the first Stage of the Inquiry, mentioned in paragraph   32(2) above, could be presented would be the Autumn of 1926.  The   Second Stage of the Inquiry might be completed in another year   (Para. 28.).24,     It is estimated that tho ooat of the Pirst Stage of the Inquiry  would lie between  60,000 and  80,000.  2ne Seoond Stage might oost   approximately  10,000.  (Paras. 29 to 31).35.     Should it  he decided to set up a Commission,  it would be   desirable to intimate to it whether the Board of Trade would prefer   to have the existence of satisfactory foundations  for the barrage  proved before any other surveys were made.   In the event  of suitable   foundations being found and the Inquiry being then proceeded with,   this course would lead to a postponement of the date of  the Report   mentioned in paragraph 33 above, and possibly an increase in the oostI j
of the other surveys owing to their being made later inthe year. (Para. 18).             We have the honour to  he,   Sir,                        Your  obedient Servants,               (Signea)       A.H.
