Ae N         regards  tho  other items,  it is suggested that the following           instructions  should bo given to  the British Government i;        delegates.-;I              I would  add that on  Wodnoeday, 4th June, the British 11        Government delegates  to  the Conference (Miss  Margaret111        Bondfield, M.P., Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry
of Labour and Mr. Rhys John Davies M.P., parliamentary under-secretary to the Homo Office)  are hoping to meetsome of the Government Delegates from tho Dominions andIndia, and, unlose I am informed of  any dissent on thepart of my colleagues before that date, I propose tosuggest to them that they should inform tho delegates, or their representatives,, for  their confidential information,of tho action whioh tho British Govornmont Delegates are proposing to take in regard with the various items onthe Agenda.2. (a) Development of facilities for the utilisation of       WorkersT Leisure&quot;;       In 0.P.201(24) I oiroulated for  the informationof tho Cabinet  a copy of  the Questionnaire issued by theInternational Labour Offioe regarding the development of facilities for  the utilisation  of workers&apos; leisuro and aoopy  Of  the reply which it  was proposed to send on behalfof His Majesty&apos;s Government.       This reply, which  was subsequently deepatohod,stated that His Majesty&apos;a Government viewed with appre-hension  the suggestion  that the  discussion might involvereference  to  questions  so far-reaching  as transport  and housing  facilities,  a break in the  working day  and thedrink traffic.    It  was thought  that any recommendationresulting  from the disoussion  at a  single conference of  the question of  the utilisation of leisure  in  tho wide aspocts contemplated  must necessarily  be of so  vaguo  and general a charaoter  as to bo of littlo praotioal utility.    The suggestion was made  that  the disouseion at  the  Conference should be  confined  to  a spooially Boleotod  aspect of the utilisation  of leisure, viz:-  the development of  tho intellectual  life of adult  workers.                        -2-
     As time did not permit of this suggestion being brought to the notice of other Governments before theOffice circulated its Report, reproducing and commenting on the replies returned to Its questionnaire by a numberof the Governments and Including a draft recommendationwhich proceeds on totally different lines, there seemslittle hope that the British proposals will secure- anygeneral measure of acceptance.     As will be- seen from the text (copy attached inAppendix I), the Office has submitted aa a basis forthe Conference&apos;s discussion a Recommendation of 3ome 1,400words, which deals generally with the utilisation ofworkers&apos; leisure in a large number of aspects.     I regret, in the interests of the Office itself,that the question has been approached in this way-.  On theother hand I feel that to instruct the British government delegates to the Conference to refrain from taking anypart in the discussion might be represented as indicatinga lack of sympathy with the Organisation.  I would propose,therefore, to instruct them to take an early opportunityof saying that, from the outset, a substantial body ofpublic opinion in this country has viewed the inclusionof this subject in the Agenda with some apprehension andthat, while they&apos;will be glad, In the course of a generalexchange of views, to hear details of the experience ofother countries, and to give information as to the positionin Great Britain, they are very doubtful whether, havingregard to the far-reaching nature of the subjeota ofdiscussion, any definite recommendation or resolutioncould be reached.  In these circumstances their participation in the discussion must  not necessarily betaken to commit them to taking part either In drafting orvoting on any recommendation or resolution,
     Moreover, it might be desirable, If a favourable opportunity occurred, for the British government representatives again to make an attempt to restrict thediscussion to the question of adult education, but It is realised that there is not much chance of their beingsuccessful In such an attempt.(k) Equality of treatment for national and foreign workers    as regards &apos;W^kmenT3 Compensation  or accidentsj    -     A copy of the draft Convention submitted by theInternational Labour Office as a basis for discussion isattached (in Appendix II).   This draft is in accordancegenerally with the views expressed by H.M.Government inthe replies to the International Labour Office&apos;a questionnaireand the only instruction which need be given to the BritishGovernment delogates is to support the adoption of adraft convention on the lines proposed.(c) Weekly suspension of work for 24 hours in glass-    manufacturing processes where&quot;tank furnaces are used:     A copy of the draft convention submitted by theInternational Labour Office as a basis for discussion isattached (in Appendix III).   It is suggested that theBritish Government delegates should warmly support theadoption of a draft convention providing for a weekly restfor all workers engaged in the processes concerned.  some difficulty arises, however, regarding the extent to whichexceptions must be made to this rest being taken at theweek-end.ns regards processes which must necessarily becontinuous for technical reasons,     It will be observed that Article 3 of the draftconvention proposes that it should be left to thecompetent authority of each Member? ratifying theConvention to draw up the list of operations
                     .. (jand classes of work which must necessarily be continuousfor technical reasons and shall not therefore be subjectto the suspension prescribed in Article 1 of the draft.Prom the replies of the various States to the InternationalLabour Office1s Questionnaire, it is clear that greatdiversity of  opinion exists on this point and that someStates e.g. Belgium (Britain&apos;s chief competitor), would beprepared to give the widest interpretation to this exemption.It is considered that if some countries are not to beplaced in an unfair position in regard to others, theoperations to be exempted under this head should be defined in the convention itself and it is proposed thatthe British Government delegates should press for this to be done.     A difficulty also arises in connection withexemptions in favour of automatic machines.   Verylittle machinery of this kind is being used in thiscountry and, up to the present, it has not been possibleto collect sufficient reliable information as to the praticability of stopping the various automatic machinesover the week-end.   Further enquiries into this questionnaire being made by the Home Office and it is suggestedthat the action of the British Government delegates atGeneva should be guided by the results of these enquiriesand the advice of the technical experts who will accompanyj;he British delegation.(d) Night work In Bakeries.     A copy of the draft Convention proposed by theInternational Labour Office as a basis for discussion isattached (in Appendix IV),  It is suggested that theBritish Government delegates should be instructed to keep
      as close as possible&apos; to the recommendations of the British      Committee of Inquiry into night work in the bread-baking and      flour confectionery trade, on which the clause in the      Government Factories Bill prohibiting night-baking is based,      and to the British Governments reply to the Questionnaire      issued by the International Labour Office, of which a copy      was circulated to the Cabinet with CP. 149(24).   It is      suggested, further that the Delegates should support a      limitation of the draft convention to the baking of bread      and flour confectionery for sale to the public.      (e) Procedure for the amendment of Conventions,:           It is understood that the International Labour Office.      will itself propose that consideration of its proposals      for a procedure for the amendment of conventions shall be      dropped until experience has been gained of the new system      recently instituted under which no draft convention will      be formally adopted by the Conference until the Conference      following that at which the draft of the Convention in      question has been adopted by a simple majority.  This      proposal is in accordance with the views already communicated      to the Office by the British Government and should receive      the support of the British Government Delegates.      (f) Report.of:,,,the, Advisory Committee qn^Anthraxs           On consideration of the Report of the Advisory Committee      on Anthrax it is recommended that the British Government      delegates should propose that a draft convention on the      subject of anthrax should be submitted to the Seventh Session      of the International Labour Conference - in June 1925.      3,   Unless any of my colleagues express their dissent before      Friday 6th June, I propose to give instructions in the above      sense to the British Government Delegates.                                      (Intd) T.  S.Ministry of Labour,      June 2nd, 1924,
APPENDK I.PROPOSED recommendations OH CONCERNINGTHE DEVELOPMENT 02&apos; FACILITIES FORTHE UTILISATION OF WORKERS&apos;  LEISUREa      Ths  General  Conference  of  the  International Labour Organisation,      Considering  that the Convention limiting the hours of worit  in industrial undertakings to  eight in the day and forty-eight  in  the week adopted at  its First session held at Washington was primarily  intended to ensure that, in addition  to  the hcura neaossary for sleep, tho workers should have  sufficient time  in whioh to do as they please;      Considoring  that their  spare time allows the workers the opportunity to develop freoly their physical, intellectual and moral powers, and for this roason Is of considerable importance to the process of oivillsation;      Considering that a propoor use of spare time by affording them the means of pursuing more varied intorests and by securing relaxation from the strain of their ordinary work  may  enhanoe their productive oapaoity and increase their output, and may thus obtain the maximum of economic efficiency from the eight-hour day;      Considering that, while giving full weight to  the customs prevalent JUi the different oontrles and to looal oiroumstanoes,  it may be nevertheless useful to lay down the principles and methods whioh at the present time seem generally best  adapted to secure the bost use of apare time,and to make known for tho benefit of all countries  what has been done in this direction In other countries;     Considering that it nay ha speoially neoessary to render suoh knowledge available at the moment when  the Convention on hours of work is being ratified and put into force by the Members of the organisation;     Recommends that eaoh Member of the InternationalLabour Organisation take the following guiding principles into  consideration;/Considering
APPENDIX I (Contd).     Considering that, if the Members whioh have placed legallimitations on.the working day are to derive all the benefits to the wage-oarnera or the community whioh may be expected from auoh measures, steps must be taken to ensure that theworkers shall have the undimini3hei enjoyment of their hoursof leisure, the Conference expreassa the hope, (a) that thevalue of the spare time afforded thorn should be fully appreciated by the workers and that they should endeavour inno circumstances to enoroach upon it, and (b) that employers should always aim at establishing wages correspondingsufficiently to the essential needs of the workers so as tomake it unnecessary fox them to have reoourae to regularpaid work in their spare time.     vfhilst recognising that legal prohibitions against thecontinuance of regular paid work for the same or anotheremployer in excess of the legal working day may be difficultto enforce and may even at ti;sea seem to infringe the workers&apos;right of uaing their spare time as they choose, theConference nevertheless considers it desirable to draw attention to tho steps whioh have been taken In this directionin a number of countries.     Considering further that every facility should be givenfor enabling the best use to be made of spare time, once its full enjoyment has been soourod,     Ihe Conference recommends:     (a) Ihat each Member, having due regard to local customs,the requirements of different industries and the varyingcapacities and habits of the differont kinds of workers,should consider the means of so arranging the working day aato make spare ti.;ie as continuous as possible (alternation ofshifts, shortening of mid-day breaks, adjustment of working hours to the season, etc.):     (b) That by means of a well-ooncoived transport system,reluoed farea and suitable time-tables, the time spent by workers between their homes and their work should be shortenedaa much aa possible, and that employers&apos; and workers&apos;organisations should be largely consulted by public or private transport authorities as to the best means of devisingsuch a system,                         II.     Seeing that facilities for the use of Optra time by theworkers cannot be separated from the general measures adoptedby the community for promoting the health and welfare of allclasses of society, and without attempting to examine indetail eaoh of the great welfare problems the solution ofwhich would contribute to improve workers&apos; living conditions,the Conference draws the attention oi the Members to theimportenoo in this connection of the following measures;                                                   /(a)
APPENDIX I (Contd,     (a) the construction of houses on u sufficient scale andwith a low rental in garden cities or suburbs under conditionsensuring a proper degree of health and comfort,  whereneoesaary with the assistance of the national or localauthorities;     (b) the provision of public bathe, swimming pools,  etc.     (e) legislative or private action against the misuse ofalcohol.                     III.     Without attempting to diaoriminato between theinnumerable institutions which afford the workers opportunities of making free use of their spare time in accordance withtheir individual tastes end which can only spring from the traditions and customs of each country, the Conference never-theleaa thinks it may be useful to point out the need for co-ordination of effort, if the founding of institutions whioh donot meet well-defined requirements is to be avoided, and toemphasise the importance of taking fully into account the needs,tastes and special requirements of the different kinds ofworkers for whose use they aro designed.     At the same time, among the institutions whioh may bothassist full and harmonious individual development and contribute to the general progress, of the oommunity, the Conferencespecially recommends those whioh have for their object:     (a) the improvement of the workers&apos; dome3tio eoonomy and family life (workers&apos; gardens, allotments, poultry keeping,etc.) , which combine the benefits of recreation with thefeeling that some addition, however alight, ia being made tothe family resources;     (b) the development of physioul health and strength bymeans of games and sports, whioh enable young men and womenworking under the highly specialised conditions prevalent in modern industry to give free play to their energies in a meaner-which enoouragea initiative and the spirit of emulation;     (c) the encouragement of technical and general education(libraries, reading rooms, lectures, technical courses,educational courses etc.), which meets the manual worker&apos;s most keenly felt need and which has always been his primarymotive for claiming more spare time, besides affordingindustrial communities the surest means of progress,                     IV.     (l) Seeing that the workers in the great industrial countries have&quot;always sought to ensure that they may livetheir lives outaide the factory or workshop in complete freedom and independence and that they particularly resent any outside interference in their private affairs, and seeing that this feeling Is so strong aa to provoke opposition toany attempt to det-l either nationally or internationally withthe use of spare time for fear that it may possibly restraintheir, liberty, the Conference draws attention to the                                                  /necessity
ATTENDIX I (Con to).necessity of safeguarding the individual freedom of theworkers against any tendenoy direot or indireot towardsobliging them to use any particular institution, andconsiders that the moot practicable and successful institutionsare those whioh have been started and developed by theworkers themselves.     In oases where public authorities or employers lendfinancial or other assistance, for the encouragement ofworkers&apos; allotments, games or educational institutions, andconsequently have a legitimate claim to take part in theirmanagement, the Conference recommends that every care shouldbe taken to avoid any enoroachment on individual liberty.     (2) While not contemplating any systematic organisationof spare time occupations, but having in mind a number of successful efforts made to assist them, the Conference furtherrecommends that each Member should consider the possibility of promoting the formation of district or local committeescomposed of representatives of the public authorities and  ofemployers&apos; and workers&apos; organisations for co-ordinating andharmonising theaetivitiea of the various institutionsproviding means of recreation.     The Conference recommends that each Member of theInternational labour Organisation forward annually to  theInternational Labour Office as detailed a report ao possible on the measures taken to develop spare-time occupations.     The Conference invites the International Labour Officeto collect and keep up to date information concerning  theuse of spare time and, on the basis of the annual reportscommunicated by the Members, to publish regularly accounts of the action taken and the results obtained in the different countries.V.
                                         APJENDIX II.W0Bffi 3H&apos;S  C0MB3HSATI0S  FOR  ACCIDENTS.353X3! OF PROPOSED DRAFT CQFgSJJTIOlir.       In the  ligkt of the replies of the government examined in the preceding chapter the International Labour Offioe has framed a  proposed Draft Contention on equality of treatment.       The draft provides for equality of treatment for the nationals of  the Members which ratify the Convention.  In drawing it up it has been tihought desirable to oonoentrafca on broad general  principled and act to go into detail.   This oourse, which was recommended by a number of Governments in their-replies and which has previously been advocated for the framing of Draft Conventions, seemed all the more necessary in a Draft Convention on a subjeot so complicated as the  present item on the Agenda of the Oonferonoe,       The idea was at one time entertained of  accompanying the proposed  Convention by a draft Secommandation defining some of the detailed methods of applying the Convention suggested in the replies of the Governments or contained in bilateral agreements on workmen1s compensation for aocidsnts.  This plan was not  without its attractions, seeing that in any case the praotical results of an agreement on the general principle would largely depend on arrangements between individual States for facilitating its operation.   On further reflection, however, it seemed preferable to leave  the Governments  oomplete freedom to adopt the  methods they might find best suited to the particular circumstances of eaoh oase.       In this oonneotion, referenoe may perhaps be made to a suggestion put forward by the  British Government that in addition to the Members ratifying it the Draft Convention might apply to other countries which,  though they may not have ratified, do in faot give identical treatment to national and foreign workers, eaoh ratifying Member being free to satisfy itself as regards any non-ratifying country which claimed to be oovered by the Convention that the oountry in question did in faot extend identioal treatment.       From the legal point of view it would appear to be difficult to introduoe  a provision of this kind into a Convention, nor would it seem necessary to do  so in order to secure the objeot whioh the British Government has in view.  Nothing in the Convention could, of oourse, prevent a Member  from granting equality of treatment to the nationals of any  other oountry whioh did riot ratify the Convention, or making reciprocal agree- ments with suoh a country.       The proposed Draft Convention whioh the  Office submits for the consideration of the Conference is as follows:
                                                       174                                               APPENDIX II (Contd),DRAFT CONVENTION CONCERNING 3QTJAIITY OF TR2ATMBNTFOR NATIONAL AND F0R3IGN tfORBSRS AS RiSGARDS WOfiKU3N&apos;S             COMP33NSATION FOR ACCIDENTS.                        Article 1.      Each Member of the International Labour organisation which ratifies this Convention undertakes to grant to workers who are nationals of any other Member which shall have ratified the Convention and who suffer personal injury by an industrialaccident happening in its territory, or to the representativesof such workers, the same treatment in raspeot of workmen&apos;compensation as it grants to its own nationals, and not tomake any discrimination against these workers or theirrepresentatives by reason of the fact that they do not resideor have ceased to reside in its territory.                        Artlolo 2.      Special agreements may bo made between the Membersconcerned to provide that compensation for Industrial aooldentshappening to workers whilst temporarily or intermittentlyemployed in the territory of one Member on behalf of anundertaking situated in the territory of another Member shallbe governed by the laws and regulations of the second Member.                        Article 3.      The Members whioh ratify this Convention further undertaketo afford eaoh other mutual assistance with a view tofaoilitating the application of the Convention and the executionof their respective laws and regulations on workmen&apos;s compensation.      In particular,      (a) When a person to whom compensation is due under the laws and regulations of one Member reaides in the territory of another Member, the necessary measures shall be taken tofacilitate the payment of suoh compensation and to ensure theobservsno8 of the conditions governing suoh payment laid downby the said laws and regulations;      (b) In case of dispute concerning the non-payment, cessation of payment, or reduoticn of the compensation due to a personresiding elsewhere than in the territory of the Member wherehis claim to compensation originated facilities shall ba affordedfor taking- proceedings in the competent courts of law in thiscountry without requiring the attendance of the person concerned.      (o) Any advantage in respeot of exemption from duties and taxes, free issue of official documents or ether privilegegranted by the law of each Member for any purposes oonnaotedwith worimen&apos;s compensation shall bs extended under the same conditions to tho subjects of the other Members whioh shall have ratified the Convention;      (d) Information as to modifications in the laws and regulations in force on workman&apos;s compensation shall becommunicated to the International Labour Office, whioh shallinform the other MembsrB concerned.
