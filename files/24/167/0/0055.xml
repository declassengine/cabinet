[This  Document is  the  Property  of  His Britannic Majesty&apos;s  Government.]                      Printed for the Cabinet.     June 1924,CP.  352(24).         The recent use of Regulation III of 1818 in Bengal.    I circulate, for the information of rny colleagues, a memorandum based largely on material  supplied  to  me by the Governor of  Bengal, together with the latesttelegram from the Government  of India on the subject.   &apos; Regulation III  of 1818 gives power to the Governor-General  in Council, when such action is required for &quot; reasons of State, embracing  ....  the security ofthe British dominions  ....  from internal commotion,&quot; to  issue warrants  forthe personal  restraint  of &quot;individuals against whom  there  may  not be sufficientground to institute any judicial proceeding, or when such proceeding may not be adapted  to the nature of  the case,  or  may  for other reasons  be unadvisable  orimproper.&quot;   It provides for periodical reports  upon such  prisoners, for their regularvisitation,  and for allowances  for their support;  and for the attachment  of  theirestates if this is judged necessary.                                                                   OLIVIER.    17th June 1924.    The Government of Bengal has found it necessary to detain under Regulation iii of ISIS four persons who had  been put on trial and  acquitted  in what is known asthe  Alipore conspiracy case.    It  has  been suggested  in  some quarters that these persons are now being punished under the regulation for  the offence of which theywere found &quot; not guilty &quot; after  trial in a court of law.   This suggestion  is altogethererroneous:    Detention  under  Regulation  III of 1818 is a preventive rather than a punitivemeasure.  The Government of Bengal have not had any intention of resorting to useof the regulation in  order to punish  persons for crimes  of  which they have beenacquitted on trial, and  the grounds  which  led  them  to take  preventive  actionagainst the four persons in question did not arise out of the facts which  were in issue in the Alipore conspiracy case.    These four persons and three others were charged in that case with being parties,along with certain others, to a criminal  conspiracy, the object of which was to commitrobbery, clacoity, dacoity with murder, and  murder, in five specified cases..    The existence of an organised body of persons acting with  the common purposeof committing offences, both  against  property  and against the  person, had been disclosed by the commission, between  15th May 1923 and 3rd  August 1923,  of fivedistinct outrages which had obviously been  inspired by the hope of substantial gain,and  which had  resulted in the deliberate murder of four persons.  All available evidence  was put forward  in  order  to establish that these outrages were the overtacts of an organised body of determined criminals.  In the course  of the trial the prosecution endeavoured to prove the complicity o   the accused persons  in  thesespecific  outrages, and thereby to  establish their  guilt as members of a  criminalconspiracy, acting with the object set  out in the charge.   The prosecution failed,since the evidence which it was possible to adduce was held insufficient  to establish the identity of  the particular accused as being concerned in  these specific outrages.    The Government do not intend to contest that decision by bringing an appeal,and the accused will not be  called upon again to answer the charges  brought against them in tbit trial.    Altogether, apart  from these  particular outrages,  Government was in possessionm August .1923 of information which established a convincing  case for action  under regulation III  of 1818.  There were before Government sufficient evidences  of theexistence of a  revolutionary conspiracy to overthrow by force the established Govern-roent and  of an  intention, in  pursuance of that  conspiracy, to exercise  terrorism bythe  murder of police  officers; and as the material in  possession of Government was sufficient  in their opinion to  establish the complicity of  many  persons in this            100  6.24
 conspiracy, warrants  were applied  for  and  obtained for  their  detention  under Regulation III.   After the warrants were  received  from the Government of  India those which concerned persons accused in the Alipore  conspiracy case were held in suspense, because it was hoped that convictions would be obtained in that  case which would put these  persons  out of  action  and so  render the use of  Regulation  III unnecessary to secure  their detention.     But the issues raised in their  trial were decided in favour of  the accused; and it was held that they were not implicated in the outrages between May  and August 1923, This did not, however, affect the question of their complicity in the conspiracy referred to  above, of the existence of  which and of the continuance of the  intentions of the conspirators additional indications had reached Government in the intervening months. The most  significant of  these was the murder of Mr. Day,  admittedly by mistake for the Commissioner of Police, Calcutta.  The emergency had  in fact become greater since the means at the disposal of  the conspirators were known to be more  effective. On fresh  examination of the  material in its possession Government decided that in order to defeat the ends of the-conspiracy, and to protect the lives  of the officers who were threatened, it was necessary to have recourse to the warrants under Regulation III of 1818, but they took action against four persons only.     In determining the  persons against whom^actiou should be  taken, Government was not influenced by  the  facts  adduced in the Alipore  trial, nor even by theadmissions which had  been made during  its course.     The material on which Government lias acted has been, as is usual in such cases,placed before two Judges for their considered  opinion as to the  justification for theaction taken.     Telegram from Viceroy, TI ome Department, to Secretary of State for India,                              dated 11th June 1924.    D. 1998.   Reference correspondence ending with your  telegram-of  27th  ultimo,1598.  Alipur conspiracy case.    2. The Judges find that Santosh, Dhiren and Subodh are active members of therevolutionary  conspiracy; that the murder of the police officers was one of  their chief  objects,;  that the  connection  of  Santosh and  Dhiren  with  Daren  Ghosh(convicted in Shankaritola murder case) has been fully established, and  Santosh has been further connected with Gopi Saha, the murderer of Mr. Dayar, and.with Jasodaand  Satyen, who  were  recently  found  In  possession of  bombs  and a  revolverrespectively.  They add  that there is good reason to believe that even when in jailas prisoners under trial in the Alipur case, they were planning  further revolutionaryactivity in the event of their release.    3. The Judges consider the case of Narendra Nath Sirkar should be differentiated.They believe .... the evidence that he  was in.  association with Bepin Ganguly andothers are of opinion (&apos;? omission), but that there appears to  be nothing sufficientlydefinite to  lead  one to consider him  an important member of  the revolutionaryconspiracy.  They add, &quot; It is his participation in the  Koua  and Goalpara outrageswhich  stands  against him.  According  to the  confession  of an accomplice to thepolice, he left behind his shoes  at both places.   They  were identified, and, as regardsthe Goalpara outrage, there are independent witnesses  on the point.   It  is only fair to mention that so much of this evidence as could be put before the jury as regardsthe Goalpara  outrage has not been accepted in  the  Alipur case.   This is the onlyevidence against him of which we find strong corroboration.&quot;    4. It will  be  observed that though the Judges recorded no definite finding in thecase  of  Narendra Nath  Sirkar,  they believed the evidence associating him  with arevolutionary conspiracy, though  they  did not  consider it  sufficiently  definite  toestablish that he was an important member.  In view of this finding, the Governmentof Bengal have recommended that he  should be released.  The  Government of india have  accepted  this  recommendation  and  orders have issued  accordingly.   ^econsider that the findings of the Judges  in the cases  of Santosh, Dhiren and Subodhare clearly  established.  A fuller  statement of our views on  the  case will follow asexpeditionary as possible.
