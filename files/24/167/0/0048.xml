THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY.OF HIS BRITANNIC MAjESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT. SECRET&apos;                      CABINET.jjc.P.345(24).   Proposed expenditure of  5,000,000 on certain                           main trunk roads.3*memorandum by the Minister of Transport.      1.     At  their meeting on May 21st, 1924, the Cabinet,  in      approving  generally of the proposed expenditure of  5,000,000      out  of the Road Fund on works of reconstruction on certain      main trunk roads,  attached the following condition to their      approvalbinet            &quot;That the arrangements to be concluded between(24)         &quot;the Minister of Transport and the local authoritiesinclusion     &quot;should,  inter alia, comprise the acceptance by theb)(iii)      &quot;local au^n6rity&quot;&quot;ai&quot; a charge against their ratepayers            &quot;during the  &quot;period of reconstruction&quot;  of the average            &quot;annual sum  expended by tho authority on maintaining            &quot;the road sections under reconstruction during the            &quot;few years preceding&quot;.      2,     The decision in this form does not correctly express my      proposals  which were, as I understood, accepted in general by      the  Unemployment Committee.   My proposal was that the whole      cost of  the reconstruction of the sections of road selected      should be  borne by the Road Fund, but that the local authority      should undertake to expend on other road undertakings out of      the  rates  an amount equivalent to any savings accruing to the      authority  as a  result of the new policy.   This proposal would      mean that  the employment provided by the reconstruction  schemes      was  additional  to  the employment already available as the result      of the local authorities&apos; expenditure, whereas strictly  inter-      preted,  the decision of the Cabinet would mean that the  local      authority  would employ less men in proportion to the amount      they had previously spent on tho roads under  reconstruction by      the  Ministry.      3.     I suggest therefore that the decision  of the Cabinet should      be amended to read as follows:              &quot;That  the Minister of Transport should impose as a            &quot;condition that a local authority accepting the scheme            &quot;should expend on other road undertakings out&apos;of the rates            &quot;an  amount equivalent to any savings accruing to the            &quot;authority as a result of the new policy.&quot;                    if.                    Initialled  H.G.      19th June, 1920.
