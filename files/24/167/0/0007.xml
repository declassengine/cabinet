  (THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNT.G MA JESTY&apos; S  GOVERNMENT) .                              OVERSEA SETTLEMENT.                4^3ffiET^       NEW  SETTLEMENT PROPOSALS MADE BY THE  COMMONWEALTH  GOVERNMENT,P.307(24).&quot;                              OP AUSTRALIA.            Note by the Parliamentary Secretary,  Department  of                              Overseas Trade.     On the S5th April last, I saw Senator Wilson, theMinister of Migration for the Commonwealth of Australia, and discussed with him the possibility of encouraging the policyof family migration and settlement in Australia by means ofadditional schemes for settling families without capital fromthis country.    The only scheme of this kind at present is theWestern Australian Scheme.     After considerable discussion, I ascertained that theprincipal reason for the comparatively slow progress which has yet been made  in connection with Land Settlement Schemes inAustralia, is  that the financial basis of the existing schemes under which one-third of the interest on the necessarydevelopmental  loans is paid by His Majesty&apos;s Government for a term of five years, is not sufficiently attractive to the States.This is particularly the case-as regards Queensland, a state which is understood to have a large expanse of territory suit-able for the purpose of family settlement from this country      In these  circumstances, and with the concurrence ofthe Treasury,  I informed Senator Wilson that we were preparedunder the Empire Settlement Act to offer a contribution of                                                       one-half/
                               .2-      ,,.                    mone-half of the interest for a period of  five years on loansnot exceeding  20,000,000 (in addition to loans which may beraised by the Commonwealth under existing schemes) fordevelopmental purposes directly connected with settlement and approved by His Majesty&apos;s Government, together with one-thirdof the interest for a ufurther period of five years.     It is contemplated that the loans would be raised in small instalments (probably in connection with loans for other purposes)  over a period of 10 years.     It was stipulated in connection with this proposal thatfor each  1,000 of loan moneys so provided,  the australian government concerned should undertake to settle at least onefamily (without capital)  averaging five persons from this country,together with five or six other assisted migrants (men, womanand children).     I had a subsequent discussion with Senator Wilson on thesubject, and he informed me that while he regarded the originaloffer as satisfactory,  he desired to have an assurance that areasonable elasticity would be allowed in connection with the typeof works which could be paid for by means of the loan moneys.In the course of the discussion I arranged that any material required for development work should be purchased in the UnitedKingdom unless It could be obtained more economically inAustralia.   It was valso suggested that any proposals shouldbe scrutinised by a Board in Australia on which a representativeof His Majesty&apos;s Government would sit.   He also, after stressingthe general difficulty of Australia owing to its division intosix sovereign States, requested that one half of the interest onthe loans should be defrayed by His Majesty&apos;8 Government for thefull term of ten years.   He added, moreover, that the Common-wealth Government would undertake to reorganise the existing arrangements for the reception, training, settlement, aftercareand housing of new settlers under Government supervision.     After carefully considering these suggestions, I came to                                                           the/
the conclusion that we  should accept Senator  Wilson&apos;8 views  andthat we  should appoint  a representative in Australia to advise  onthe schemes  from the point of view of His Majesty&apos;s Government.      I agree that it  is not possible to justify defraying  ona-balf of  the interest for a  term of  ten years  on  purely  financial grounds,  but  I am satisfied that on political  grounds it is  important to  make  a &quot;beau geste&quot;  to Australia,  and that for the  purpose of showing&apos;the importance which is  generally attached  to the migration and settlement of  families  without capital, we should  make  an  offer which  is  so attractive  that the State  Governments  in Australia could hardly fail to  take advantage  of it.    The  offer which  I desire to make is  fully within the terms  of the Empire  Settlement Act,      These wider proposals have been discussed with the Treasury who do not feel able,  without the consent of the Cabinet, to concur in the additional concessions desired by Senator Wilson, I therefore desire to iay the question before the  Cabinet for their consideration, and I may add that in view of the motion put down for discussion by Sir John Harriott in the House of Commons on the 28th instant, it is important that an                       v early decision on the subject should be reached, so that it may be announced in the House in connection with that motion.                                    WILLIAM LV8S,                                      Chairman,                              Oversea Settlement Committee,
