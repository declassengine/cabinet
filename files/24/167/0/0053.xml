t* *i Ll(THIS IOOUMEHT IS THE PBOPERTY OF HIS BRITAMIO  MAJESTY13  GOVERNMENT). CP.35Q(24).                                                   /L/V -----------                CAB I. N. E I.                THE CONVEYANCING (SCOTLAND)  AMENDMENT                               BILL .                   Memorandum by the Lord Advocate.     I venture to bespeak the goodwill of the Cabinettowards this measure which has been introduced as aPrivate Member&apos;s Bill by the Solicitor-General under thelate Government and having secured an unopposed SecondHeading will come before the Scottish Grand Committeefor the second time on 19th June.  When it was firstbefore the Committee on 28th May consideration was adjourned to allow of further study of the provisionsof the Bill and questions were then asked as to the government&apos;s attitude to it.     I suggest that the Secretary for Scotland might beauthorised to stats that the Government regard the Billwith favour and would be pleased to see it pass into lawwhile Indicating that if it evokes opposition theycannot undertake to grant facilities for its further progress.     My justification for suggesting the adoption of thisbenevolent attitude towards the Bill is that I am satisfiedthat it represents a substantial advance in the directionof facilitating and cheapening the transfer of land and houses, an object with which the Government is in sympathy.It will have an especially beneficial effect in reducinglegal expenses in connection with small transactions whichare disproportionately burdened in this respect.  In view
of the considerable  amount  of  conveyancing work  incidental to the provision  of  houses  anything which  tends  to reducethis element of cost is  desirable.     Conveyancing is a highly  technical, probably tootechnical,  affair and I  do  not think it necessary toexplain the provisions of the  Bill  in detail.  It maysuffice to  say that  it is the  outcome of the prolongedlabours of  a highly  skilled Committee originally appointedby my predecessor Mr, Alexander Ure.  It has the general assent of the legal  profession in Scotland who would welcomeits passage into  law and the Scottish Convention of  RoyalBurghs have recently specially memorialised  tho  Governmentin it3 favour.  There has been no Conveyancing amendment bill of any consequence  since  the legislation of 1858 and1874 and the experience  of  the past fifty  years  has  shown the desirability of  reducing formalities,  removing anomalies,,and eliminating expensive and  useless complexities in the  law.     The Bill was originally presented to  the House  ofCommons in 1920 but  although non-contentious in  characterits passage has since been  unavoidably postponed.  I amemboldened to think  that the Government might well view with satisfaction the passage  during their tenure of officeof a practical measure which will be welcomed in scotland as of substantial advantage to the  community,                                 (Intd.)   H.P.M,16th June,  1924,
