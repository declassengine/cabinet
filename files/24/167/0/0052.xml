                With reference to Cabinet 36  (24) Conclusion 11 EVICTION I.         the Conference of Ministers had before them a           Memorandum (CP. 340  (24)) by the Minister of Health           relative to the action to be taken by the Government           regarding the amendments made by the House of lords           to the.Prevention of Eviction Bill.                Ministers were reminded that tho urgency of this           question arose from the fact that the lords  Amendments           to the Bill constituted the first Order in the House of&apos; ,           Commons today, (For text of the Prevention of Eviction           Bill as first printed by the Lords see Appendix I;           for the lords  Amendments see Appendix II.).                General agreement was expressed with the view that,           having regard to political considerations and particu-           larly to the fact that acceptance by the Government           even of those amendments by the Lords of seooncary           importance  would be opposed by the Liberal Party,  the           best oourse to adopt, would be for the Government to           indicate their disagreement with all the amendments.                It was pointed out that if as a result of this           action the House of Lords subsequently decided to           insist on oertain of the amendments it would then be           open to the Government to consider whether concessions         .  should be made with a view to saving the Bill.                The Conference agreed:-                (l)  That the Ministers in charge of the Bill                     should be authorised to move in the House                     of Commons this afternoon to disagree with                     each of the Lords&apos; Amendments set out in                     Appendix II.                ( )  That in disagreeing with the first mentioned                     of these Amendments the Ministers in charge                     of the Bill should be authorised to move                     in lieu thereof  an amendment - the effect of                     which would be to substitute &quot;landlord&quot; for                     &quot;owner&quot; in line 15 of the Bill.
