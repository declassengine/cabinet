IIS DOCUMENT, IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;S gOVEMMBH.T,se2  (24).              CABINET.     THE TRADE POSITION AND PROSPEOTS.Note by the President of the Board of Trade.3u      I  oiroulate for  the  information of my oolleagues a note of  the  view  taken  by  business men of the trade outlook as given to me  in oonfidenoe by the  members of the Board of Trade Advisory Council  at the last meeting of the Counoil on.July  2nd.  .1 am also  circulating  a similar note of the Junemeeting of the Advisory Committee to the Department of Overseas Trade.      As a general  impression it may be  said that aooording tothese reports,  trade  oontinues to be quiet,  but in some branches is  experiencing a  slight  Improvement j and there are some indications  that this may be maintained and perhaps in some oases increased.      As regards coal, both the home and the  export tradeshave  fallen  off, and  in iron and  steel  there is,.at present,continued depression.   In the cotton trade,  however,  there  are signs of some  revival of  business;  the  food trades are in a fairly  satisfactory oondition, and  the  hides and  leatherindustries enjoy good prospeots for the rest of the  year.General engineering is  not  so happily placed,  but  the electrical &quot;hranohes are moderately  active,  .      The woollen and worsted industries are  depressed)1  and,in particular,  find difficulty in obtaining  from Germanypayment for  goods, owing  to  the currency and credit difficultties  in that country.      The Co-operative Societies report  that  there have beenreductions in wholesale prices which have in most oaseB  been passed  on to the consumer^ in England,  the societies trade has inoreased, whilst in  Sootland,  though it has slightlyfallen off,   it  is higher  than at the corresponding period      last year,of Trade,^y, 1924.(Intld.)

                    CONFIDENTIAL.,THE TRADE OUTLOOK.ENGINEERING - GENERAL TRADE.     Sir Arthur Balfour said that Sheffield Trade in general was not&quot;so good, buyers not being so keen as they were throemonths ago. Trado with the Colonies was keeping up, butnot with China or Japan.  There was a ,little more unemploy-ment In Sheffield, generally, and he was not so hopefulas he had been.     Trade In-Franoe was, he understood, falling off rapidly,especially in the engineering departmentsj, this might affect British trade there. The set-baok was perhaps due in part to prospects of increased taxation and the efforts of the Prenoh Government to collect arrears, &apos;                 ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING..     Mr. Hirst said that business In general elootrioalmaterial was, on the whole, not bad. There had beep somecontraction of business during last month or so, butgenerally the situation was better than  last year.Telephone material was in good demand, but the heavyelectrical industry was suffering on aocount of the prevailing dullness of the main industries. In one direo-tion, however, there was activity, namely, that the linkingvip of electrioal districts was creating  a demand fortransformers, rotary converters and tho  like.     He desired to make two suggestions  for the&apos;Government-^B&apos;consideration,      (l) This Government, like the preceding Government,were  endeavouring to bring aotivity into the electrioalindustry by stimulating the placing of  order by looalauthorities. These  orders were, however, plaoed in ahaphazard fashion,  and he would suggest  that the point should  be considered whether  the authorities oould not submitprogrammes in;advance. The spasmodic placing of orders did not give  the industry that degree of assistance which wasfeasible. The announcement of requirements in good timebeforehand would bo of value  from the point of view ofmaintaining employment and of keeping the oost of production-tion at a steady level.      (2) His second suggestion was prompted by the faot thatthe demand for  electrioal appliances for factories and fordomestio purposes is poor in  this country as compared withGermany and the United States. This could be remedied ifeleetrioal undertakings here  were limited in the price theyoharge for power.   The assurance that moderate prices per&apos;5tnit  would be asked throughout the country for the supplyof(,eleotrloity would do much  to help the electrical trade,and would also probably benefit our industries generally.      Mr. Lunn said he understood that a  Cabinet Committeewore  considering the question of the speeding up ofmunicipalities1 orders, with  a view to  assisting employment;Mr. Hirst&apos;s first suggestion  could probably be passed on tothem.  His second point appeared to be  one for. the  -Electricity Commissioners8  The Soard of Trade would seethat  both were  put  before the proper authorities.
IROM AND STEEL.    Mr.Baker said the situation of the Heavy Iron and SteelIndustry oontinued much as during the previous month; therewere no reports of any mills re-opening or fnrnaoes being put into blast.  The number of mills and furnaces workingwas not, however, the best guide to the position of thetrade; he understood, for instance, that Messrs.Guest, Keenand Nettlefold had several furnaces out of commission, but were getting something like a reoord output from theirfurnaoes remaining in work.  Firms had been re-modellingtheir plant, and could perhaps produce relatively more whileemploying fewer men.    There seemed no prospect of trade improving in theimmediate future,  in the United States the trade press wasoptimistic    Mr.Arthur Dorman said that he had had to give a gloomyaccount of the Iron and Steel Industry last month,  andthere had not been any appreciable improvement since,  Thesheet trade was good, and tin plates also were fairly satisfactory.  Ship-building was dilatory, though a feworders for ships had been placed.    Iron and Steel makers found that their coal supplies were a little cheaper, and coke considerably so.  Cheapcoal was an absolute essential to the industry.    Continental competition was, if anything,  keener.Continental makers quoted prices in the neighbourhood of 6.5s.Od. per ton for steel bars which cost us some  8 perton, to produce.    There was perhaps a momentary over-production of iron,and a. few blast furnaces might have to go out of blast,  butthis was  in any oase a slack season.   There seemed to bea oertain undernote of hopefulness that conditions  might be better in the autumn.                        COAL.    Mr.Evan Williams said he had a cheerless account togive of the Coal Trade,  Export trade had fallen offseverely in all districts, espeoially Scotland;  it was true that Scotland had benefited more than other areas bythe temporary impetus given to export by the occupation ofthe Ruhr.  The North East Coast was feeling the competition of German ooal in neutral countries, as well as thelessening of the previous demand from Allied Countriesresulting from the Ruhr occupation.  In South Wales thedrop had for various reasons not been quite so severe, buthe saw no reason to hope for any oarly improvement.  Thelevel of prices and of probably demand was baok to thatof 1922, and probably larger quantities of German ooal(otherthan Reparation Coal; were boing sold now than was the casethen.    Not so muoh United States ooal was finding its way to europe, and there appeared to be no increase in the amount which the United States furnish to South Amerioa.
CONFIDENTIAL,                       ;                         COAL.    As regards the home trade, over and above the naturalfalling off in the market for domestic ooal in the summer,a deolin9 was taking place in the oall for industrialooal, since fewer furnaces wero in blast now than at thebeginning of the year, and he feared that others would go out of blast shortly.  The ooal trade generally seemedto be in for a bad time.  In South Wales some pits were working short time, hut this tendency was not so markedthere as in other areas.    He thought a good deal of the depression was to botraced to the increased supply of Reparation coal from the ruhr.                    TEXTILES; COTTON.    Sir Edwin Stockton said that Manchester cotton goodshad shown&quot; little change, hut probably a slight Improvement.The big discount on cotton futures was a diffioulty,though this had been reduoed from 3-Id. to 2d. per lb.    There appeared to be no chance of full time working in the industry till bigger supplies of raw cotton wereavailable.  Markets were badly in need of goods, hut prioesoontinued too high, and buyers perhaps held off in anticipation of a possible drop,    Mr.Holroyd said that there had been a somewhat largerdemand during the past month for cotton cloth and goodsthan previously, tout the discount on cotton futures was an adverse faotor.  Considerable trade was, nevertheless,being done for future months; this promised well for business during and after August next.  He was, on thewhole, more optimistic than for some time past.                     TEXTILES:  WOOL    Mr.Andrews said that in the combing branch of the WoolTrade there was no inorease in unemployment, but moreunder-employment.  A general lack of confidence was inevidence; this was perhaps partly due to the financialposition in Germany, sinoe while we oontinued to exportthere, diffioulty was being met with in getting payment.    As regards the Australian Exchange question, Bradfordwas interested to learn that the Federal Government wasattempting to solve this by reorganising the CommonwealthBank, but he feared that these measures would not become effective early enough to help the British wool trade inSeptember, when the next buying season began.  Traders werewondering if an arrangement oould not be entered intobetween the Federal Government and the Home Government,  bywhich British currency should be legal tender in Australia,-.as gold was in pre-war times.    Mr.Beaumont Pease observed that this problem had been raised at the Imperial Economic Conference.  Disoussionsthen took place between the Treasury and the AustralianDelegation, and the bankers&apos; views were obtained; the
TEXTILES: WOOL.legislation which was now being introduced by Mr.Brucewas an outcome of those conversations.  It looked as ifthe measures proposed should be sufficient to overcome the trouble.  The difficulty had been aggravated by the issue of empire Loans, leading to a concentration of money on this side beyond ordinary seasonal fluctuations.                 TEXTILES: WORSTED. ETC.    Mr.Sutoliffe Smith said that trade was worse;unemployment and under-employment were increasing - mainly in the wool sorting, wool oombing and worsted spinningsections.    The home trade was decreasing; only some 50% of loomswere running and immediate prospects were not good.  goods were even more difficult to sell now than in the slump of1921; the Frenoh were quoting lower prices than ever.  the spinning trade in general had not been worse for many years past; only about 50% of spindles wero employed.    Bradford&apos;s large export trade in yarns to Germany hadbeen interrupted by currency and credit difficulties,    Trade with the Continent was unsatisfactory, oustomersnot paying their accounts through exchange difficulties;numerous orders had been oancelled,    A few orders wero coming forward from Canada, Australia,and South America; and distinctly more hopefulness prevailedas regards India, particularly of securing more of theootton trade there, owing to the fact that the italians had used up their cheap cotton,  and had had to raise theirprioes.    The politioal situation in China continued disturbed,and for similar reasons the outlook in the Near East wasnot very hopeful.    Less business was expected from Japan than last season,sinoo buying there had been overdone,  and tho country wasimpoverished.    In conclusion he wished to sound a warning against themaking of publio pronouncements about trade of anexoessively sanguine oharacter;  these,  he thought,  couldonly do harm.                        LEATHER.    Sir Percy Densham wrote:-    &quot;This time of the year is generally a slack season inthe heavy leather trade; indications, however, are thatthe seasonal decline in demand is not quite so marked as usual and that there is a fair consumptive demand .for leathervery nearly equal to output and that stocks are notaccumulating to any considerable amount.  Tho export trade
LEATHER.has remained reasonably good and the boot trade isprobably above normal for the time of the year.    &quot;The hide market for the last 2 months has been fairlysteady, particularly for domestic hides and wet saltedhides.  Dry hides being somewhat above parity are atpresent a weak market.  The German finanoial orisis hasmade the raw material market somewhat nervous; but,rather to our surprise, has had very little effect onhide and raw material prioes.  It is also rathersurprising that the largely decreased output of hides inthe TJ.S.A. has not had a stronger effect on raw materials.    &quot;These points appear to me to go to prove that theproduction of hides and leather and the consumption ofleather are about equal.  We are looking forward to a steady and regular trade between now and the end of theyear.&quot;                    FOOD INDUSTRIES.    Mr.Stanley Maohin wrote    &quot;In connection with the food industries, the signsof returning confidence to which I referred at our last meeting are, I am glad to say being maintained.  The sugarusing industries are undoubtedly being helped by the substantial reduction in the Duty, whioh has been followedby the unusual experience of a substantial fall in f.o.b,prioes.  While the general position still leaves a gooddeal to be desired, inquiries both for the home market and export are undoubtedly onoouraging.&quot;                       SHIPPING.    Sir  Alan Anderson said that freights had deolinedsomewhat in MaroTH  The index figure for June would probablyshow some further drop.  The spurt in freight rates last winter had been followed by a considerable drop in the summer; the general level at 1st January and 1st May ofthis year corresponded closely to that obtaining atcorresponding dates in 1923.  The only indication thatthe industry had made any headway lay in the reduotion oftonnage laid up.  World trade had apparently expandedenough ,to take up a certain amount of additional tonnage,though at low rates.    The decrease in the British laid-up fleet was doubtlessgreater than in the United States (sinco American costs of operation were higher), but less than in Germany, whereat present practically no ships were laid up; someScandinavian countries could also operate vessels more cheaply than we can.  In Britain, then,  the industry had shown no marked ohange, but a gradual absorption of surplustonnage was going on all over the world.
CONFIDENTIAL412               CO-OPERATIVE SOCIETIES  (ENGLAND).      Sir Thomas Allen said that a hopeful feeling prevailedIn regard to the retail trade generally.  There had been a fall  in wholesale prices as compared with last year.  Forgeneral provisions  this drop amounted  to some 15 to 20%&apos;, agood  deal of it was due to the remission of  taxation  on sugar and Tea,  Sugar prices had decreased by some 36$; Tea 12%;Flour 10$; Bacon 12$; Cheese 4$.  Butter on  the other handhad shown a marked  increase of 29%  and Coal  121$.      The reduction  in wholesale prices had with one or twoexceptions been passed on to the consumer.      It was also satisfactory to note  that,  whilst prices had decreased, there had been an increase of trade at thelower prices.  The  volume in foodstuffs sold was greater than twelve months ago.  The position of the Provision Market,, bothwholesale and retail, was very satisfactory; this was reflected in the situation of allied trades,  such as furnishinet which showed an all-round increase of some 15$.  Customers^ buyingpower appeared to be greater.      There were some indications of a  possible sharp  advance in prices in about  a month&apos;s time.  A  substantial increase hadtaken place in the  price of Wheat,  viz., from 5/- to  6/- a quarter.  Adverse reports were also being received of cropsin the United States,  He hoped however that increasedimportation of Wheat from Russia might ease  the position.There seemed also reason to look for some advance in  the priceof Butter and Cheese.  It might be  noted that a certain amountof Russian Flour, and of Siberian Butter, was coming  to thiscountry,      A boom was taking place in the linen trade for export toGermany and the Continent generally.      The Coal position gave some ground for  uneasiness,  sincethe economic position of consumers was generally such thatthey  could not store supplies.  It  was feared that next winter, as last, the poorer consumer would find it hard  tocome  by his requirements of ceal.      In reply to an. inquiry how far he would attribute thefall  in Tea prices  to the reduction of the duty,   Sir  ThomasAllen said that the decline in the wholesale price amounted tosome  12% as compared with last year: the whole of the  reduo-tion  of the duty had not been passed on to the retailer.   Theprice of better class Teas had risen sharply, through  other causes, just after the duty was reduced:  the basic price  ofcheaper grades had however remained practically stationary.The reduced prices  which he had referred to were  duty-paid.               CO-OPERATIVE SOCIETIES (SCOTLAND),     Mr, Gallacher said that Scottish Co-operative Societieshad experienced-a&quot;slight falling off in consumers&apos; demandsduring June as compared with the previous five months,  butthere was still an increase over June of last year.  Lessunemployment was reported in the Motherwell area than forsome years past, but the West of Scotland suffered fromdepression in the Coal Trade, and numbers of miners were onlyworking four days a week; his Society felt the effect of thisdirectly, since half their members were within a radius of25 miles from Glasgow.
        CO-OPERATIVE SOCIETIES (SCOTLAND) (Oontd.).     It had been suggested that there had been a generaldecline in the standard of living during the last six months,The deduction in Sugar prices had been followed by prac-tically no increased demand, and the same was the case withBread,  June had been a somewhat worse month for the ScottishCo-operative Societies than they had experienced for sometime past.                          BANKING.     Mr, Beaumont Pease said, with regard to the generalbanking position, that monetary conditions had been fairlyeasy during the past month; the stringency which wasordinarily felt at the end of the half year had been inevidence at the end of June, and had possibly been increasedby the expectation of a rise in the Bank Rate,  public attention was much directed to the United States Exchange,which had shown a steady decline since April of last year;it then stood at about 4,68, and had since fallen some 30points, with the exception of one sharp rise this April,Usually the highest point was reached in the early summer,and the lowest in the autumn, when cotton and other Amerioancrops are coming over to this country.     The demand for capital continued, and considerableissues were being made, both for Industrials in this countryand for foreign loans - probably more for the latter,     Mr. Tennant said that there was a good demand for loarB ,especially from Australia,  As regards trades which had notbeen referred to by other speakers, his bank&apos;s reportsshowed that the Hosiery and Glass trades h*d experienceda distinct improvement.                        GENERAL TRADE.     Mr. Baring said that a waiting attitude still charao-terized many lines of business, notably that of theImportant textile industries whose interest was centred onthe prospects of the American cotton crop now in process efgrowth.  The eventual volume of this crop could not, atpresent, be estimated within a margin of about 2 millionbales.  The weather during June had been favourable and tothis factor might perhaps be ascribed the increased con-sumption of such articles as sugar, canned provisions,  andedible oils.  West African oils and nuts had advanced 10$ in value since the end of May, and in this market Germany was reported to be buying again.  The low price of hides seemedto have attracted buyers, and a large business had beentransacted with the River Plate.  Credits were in gooddemand for European account, but the contrary was the casein America and in New York rates of discount were quoted 1%below ours, a faot which enhanced the value of dollar creditsrelatively to sterling.
C confidential&amp;1 A                      INDIAN TRADE.     Mr. LjndBay said that the monsoon period in India,which lasted from June to September, had now begun; it had started late, but this was a good sign, since it suggestedthat it would also finish late; this was an important point.The forecast ao far was goad.  The effect on trade took theform of a seasonal falling-off in exportss  &quot;these normallyreached their highest figure during January, February and march, and a reduction then followed.  Imports were steady,and takings of cotton piece goods were maintained.     The  adverse balance of Indian Trade in April was probably due to sterling purchases for remittances to the india Office amounting to some  5,000,000; the correspondingpurchases during May  amounted only to  800,000,  As thesefigures are taken into account in computing the monthlybalance of trade, the adverse balanoe for April was con-verted to a favourable balance for May,                     FAR EASTERN TRADE.     Sir Charles Addis said that, speaking from the Bankerspoint&quot; of view, the general volume of Eastern Trade seemed tocontinue on normal lines.  Political conditions in China, hadnot Improved, and on account of the weakening control ofthe Central Government there had been an increase in piracyon the waterways.     He noted that a change was taking place in the method offinance from a sterling to a dollar basis.  In the case ofone bank that he knew of, shipments to the United States,China and Japan, were being financed to the extent of fiftymillion gold dollars per month, where formerly sterling hadbeen the medium almost entirely.  Jute and jute productsremained now practically the only articles which vrerefinanoed by sterling.     Reports of possible further rises of prices in thiscountry led him to wonder whether many of the difficultieswhich we experience have not their origin in the uncertaincurrency position in this country, and whether they couldnot be ameliorated or prevented by bringing the poundsterling back to a gold basis.  This was a matter which boththe manufacturer and the merchant seemed apt to neglect in considering their difficulties.  Even if lower prices resulted,the position of the working classes might be improved by an advance in their real wages.  He hoped that this subject would receive the attention which it deserved,     Mr. Landale said that the disturbed state of China inter-interfered both with importation and exportation in that country,though in spite of it a not unsatisfactory business was being kept up.  The high price of ootton and wool curtailed theimportation of cotton piece goods and woollen goods intoChina, and the difficulty of collecting payment or arrangingfinance in China under present conditions was a furtherobstacle.  Normally China1s exports, though ultimatelydestined to a large extent for the Continent, were largelymarketed in this country, but this was being impeded by thegenerally unsettled state of the Continent,     British shipping in China was suffering from subsidizedJapanese competition.     Trade between China and the United States was formerlyfinanced through London, but now by direct gold dollar billson New York,

fidential.Statements regarding the Export trade Position made at the    Advisory committee to the Department of Overseas       S!rade at the meeting held on the 18th June,  1924.          MR. DODWELL  stated that trade with the Far east was upset hy the  state of affairs in China,   He thought,however, that Mr. Eraser&apos;s reports in the  &quot;^Imes&quot; regardingthe conditions in China were often much too pessimistic.More business was being done with that country that a study of the situation would lead one to believe possible.         In reply to a question as to whether any improvement in buying power in China was observable, Mr.Do dwell said that it was not so good now as at this timelast year.   Brigandage was preventing the movement ofgoods.         SIR WILLIAM ELLIS said with regard to the exporttrade position, that trade with roumania and Poland was atpresent greatly hampered by the political situation - thepossibility of the annexation of Bessarabia by Russia.Both countries would soon be in a position to expend money on the purchase of locomotives and rolling stock, etc.,but they were holding back because of the possibilityreferred to.         A good deal of business in the Dominions was going to Germany and Belgium on account of the lack of sympathy shown here with the Dominions&apos;  point of view.India had openly expressed unwillingness to purchase fromthe United kingdom, and when it was  remembered that forthe last 20 years Indian orders had been the mainstay ofthe British engineering trade,  the. gravity of the situation would be seen.   Everything? possible  should,  in his opinion,be done to bring about a better feeling in Empire marketstowards this country.         SIR ALGERNON ELRlffi said that he  had nothing good torep or
LIEUT./ report regarding the textile trades, which were much disturbed by the high price of raw materials.   Nobody, in fact, knew where prices were going, but little could be done to remedy matters in this direction beyond making every effort to increase production in order to bring prices down.      MR. OHfiETH lEfc stated that spinners of American cotton wars working 26f hours per week, and had agreed to continue at this, rate up to September.   The experience of his own firm showed that trade changes rapidly at the present time. Last year Scandinavian buyers reported that they could not buy here on account of German and French competition.   JEhis year they were eomihg back to us because German shd French competition had vaniahetf  or was no longer serious. Lancashire was doing very well,  in Germany at the present time.   Prospects of business in northern Europe were not bad.    Prospects in India, however, were still doubtful, because of the price of raw material.    It looked as if prices would be high next year,  as the American crop had not been very good.      MR.  BUCHANAB said he thought that no anxiety need be felt with  regard to the  drdinary class of continental iron and steel material.   Owing to an improvement in the French exchange,  pig iron  from France could not now be  sold at competitive  prices  in this country t while  British pig iron was being purchased by  the German Roheisen Verband.   She one thing that was  troubling the iron  and steel  people  at the present  time was the  importation into  the UhitOd Kingdom of  Indian pig iron,  which was  coming both  from the Bengal Oompany and  the fata Company.    It  was difficult for him  to appreciate the need for  an Indian tariff when this trade  was possible.  In India  the  railways were  still under  the control of  Anglo-Indiana, who have  always  done much for  the  iron  and steel trade.    He thought,  therefore,  that we  should continue to  get a  good share  of business  from the railways.    the bombay docks  and warehouses  were practically  empty,  and he saw some  prospect of orders  when the political situation had settled down,.   Also in China.    There Was no reason to feel depressed aa  to  the  future.   A  60$ increase  on pre-war costsmust  now  be looked oh as a low figure  to work on, and that level seemed  to  have been reached.   The iron and steel trade would receive  Some relief  in  the probable event of coalpricea becoming  easier.      MR. WILLIAMSON  said that business with North America had declined&quot;,&quot;&quot; tut in South America an improvement was observable.The trade  done  in may was the best of any month since June,1923, and  British shipments to South America were nine times the value  of  continental shipments, as against l-  times inFebruary.   At the last meeting he mentioned that we had been successful in  securing orders for oil well casings againstflzecho-Slovakian competition, and he was aorry to have toreport that the -position had now been reversed, the Czeehprices being 25ftbelow British.   Stocks were rather barein Peru.

nfiaential.    Statements regarding  the Export trade  Position made  at  the        Advisory committee  to the  Department of Overseas           trade at  the meeting held on the 18th June, 1924.          IS. DODWBLL  stated  that trade with the Ear east was upset by the  state of affairs in China.   He thought,however, that Mr. Eraser&apos;s reports in the  &quot;^Imes&quot; regarding&apos;the conditions in China were  often much too pessimistic.More business was being done with that country that a study of the situation would lead one to believe possible.         In reply to a question as to whether any improvement in buying power in China was observable, Mr.Do dwell said that it was not  so good now as at this timelast year.   Brigandage was preventing the movement ofgoods.         SIR WILLLaM ELLIS said with regard to the exporttrade position, that trade with roumania and Poland was atpresent greatly hampered by the political situation - thepossibility of the annexation of Bessarabia by Russia.Both countries would soon be in a position to expend money on the purchase of locomotives and rolling stock, etc.,but they were holding back because of the possibilityreferred to.         A good deal of business in the Dominions was going to Germany and Belgium on account of the lack of sympathy shown here with the Dominions&apos;  point of view.India had openly expressed unwillingness to purchase fromthe United Kingdom,  and when it was  remembered that forthe last 20 years Indian orders had been the mainstay ofthe British engineering trade, the gravity of the situation would be seen.    Everything possible  should,  in his opinion,be done to bring about a better feeling in Empire marketstowards, this country.         SIR ALGERNON PIRIII said that he  had nothing good to                                                       report/
/Ho&apos;i I o                       -2- report regarding the textile trades, which were much disturbed by the high price of raw materials.   Nobody, in fact, knew where prices were going, but little could be done to remedy matters in this direction beyond making every effort to increase production in order to bring prices down.      MR. OKMETM LEE stated that spinners of American cotton were Working 26  hours per week, and had agreed to continue at this rate up to September.   The experience of his own firm snowed that trade changes rapidly at the present time. Last year Scandinavian buyers reported that they could not buy here on account of German and French competition.   SEnis year they were comlhg back to us because German arid Frenea competition had vanished  or was no longer serious. Lancashire was doing very well,  in Germany at the present time.   Prospects of business in Northern Europe were not bad.    ProspectB in India, however, were still doubtful, because of the price of raw material.    It looked aa if prices would be high next year,  as the American crop had not been very good.      MR.  BUCH4NAB said he thought that no anxiety need be  felt with  regard to the  ordinary class of continental if on and steel material.   Owing  to an improvement in the French exchange,  pig iron from  France  could not now be  sold at competitive  prices  in this countryj while British pig iron waa being purchased  by the German Roheisen Verband;   She one thing that was  troubling the iron  and steel  people  at the present  time was the  importation into the United Kingdom of Indian pig iron,  which was  coming both from the Bengal Company and  the lata Company.    It  was difficult for him to appreciate the need  for an Indian tariff when this trade was possible.  In India  the railways  were  still under  the control of Anglo-Indians, who have  always  done much for  the  iron and steel trade.    He thought,  therefore,  that we  should continue to get a  good share  of business  from the  railways.    SheBombay docks  and warehouses  were  practically  empty,  and he saw some  prospect of orders  when  the political situation had settled down..   Also in China.    There was no reason  to feel depressed as  to  the  future.   A  60$ increase  on pre-war costsmust  now be looked oii as a  low figure  to work on, and that level seemed  to  have been reached.   The  iron and steel trade would receive  some relief  in  the probable event of coal prices becoming  easier.     MR. WILLIAMSON  said that business with North America had declined&apos;,&quot;&quot;but&apos; in South America an improvement was observable.The trade done  in Mfily was the best of any month since June,1923, and British shipments  to South America were nine times the value of  continental shipments, as against If times inFebruary.   At the last meeting he mentioned that we had been successful in  securing orders for oil well casings againstCzecho-Slovakian competition, and he was sorry to have toreport that the position had now been reversed, the Czeehprices being 25$ below British.   Stocks were rather barein Peru.   Colombian coffee had been fetching good prices,and people in that country ought to be in a position-to buy.In Chile the position was not so good,  while in Equadorconditions were bad owing to the failure of the coffee crop.LIEUT./
Colonel/      LIBUg,-COIflKBL WATTS-MORGAN said that with regard to coal the export trade in April was worse than in March. It had not been possible to recover the coastal trade with Prance and he would be glad if the Department could do something to help.   A few orders had been secured,  but not nearly enough.   The classes of coal involved are semi-bituminous and semi-anthracite.      Mr. Goodenough and Colonel Willey,who were unable to be present at the meeting,  sent the following written statements:-      MR. ttOODEBOUGE:      &quot;She uncertainty of the  political situation,  and the delays in the adoption of a scheme for settling the  question of Separations,  have  distinctly prejudiced certain foreign exchanges, particularly those of Prance  and Belgium.   In those countries  the value of  the currency  abroad has  been forced down  below the internal purchasing  parity,  and through this many of  the industries of this country are suffering owing  to increased  foreign competition.      She Index Number of wholesale  prices  in this  country, although there was a  decline  during the  month of May,  is higher than  a year ago.   On  the other hand,  the price level in America is lower.    Shis factor,  in conjunction with the -unfortunate  effects  produced by the  untimely rumours of a possible inflation policy,  has resulted in  the depre- ciation of sterling in  terms  of dollars, which in  turn has had the effect of increasing  the costto  our manufacturers of imported  raw  material, and haa added  to  the  coat of living.      The reduction in the Federal Reserve  Discount Rate to a  figure which,  in the more important  districts in America, is  now below our Bank Rate, should  help  the exchange, but the  pressure  of  Autumn requirements  and  the purchase of dollars on Government account, work  in the opposite direction. The  severe credit stringency  in  Germany  is making business with that country  very  difficult,      There are signs, however, that, as  compared with a year  ago,  there  is a larger volume of  business passing. Bank  figures  in  this country  show that advances,to customers  . have  increased by nearly 6$, and in addition, &quot;commercial bills  are  more freely offered  for discount.   The figures of  Bank Acceptances, which provide a fairly reliable  test of  the  activity of foreign trade, show a still more marked increase,  and inasmuch as &quot;finance;I transactions, are certainly  less,  such -increase  ia all the more satisfactory, as  it  represents a larger number of credits opened specifically  for shipment of goods.   At the same time the acceptanco figures have declined since February, partly due to  seasonal influences.      There ia leas confidence than was felt at the commencement  of the year, largely owing to the postpone-ment of a  satisfactory settlement in Europe:.     Tho  improvement in conditions in Austria, Hungary, and Poland seems to be favourable for better trade with these  countries.&quot;
COLOMBL WILLEY:     &quot;Employment in the wool textile trade, particularlyin the West Riding of Yorkshire, is rsther  lesB good thanit was two months ago. many mills remain on short time,particularly in the spinning and weaving, and latterlythis has been extended.   The home trade demand generallyis still disappointing, hut in the last few weeksdevelopments in Germany have had a material bearing on theposition.     Deliveries against contracts; yarns for Germany havebeen in many cases held up, again where they have not beenheld up suppliers are themselves withholding shipmentsowing to the non-receipt of remittances due.   Prom ailquarters the credit position in Germany is reported asacute; it appears, however, to be changing rapidly.Whereas a month ago debtors in Germany reported that theirdifficulty arose from their inability to exchange theirRentenmarks for Valuta owing to the drastic restrictionsplaced on the banks for the supply of Valuta, to-day thesituation has changed round and there is drasticdifficulty in obtaining internal payments, so that Germandebtors are without the necessary currency where-with toapply for Valuta.   This is the result of the settled policy of the German Government to support the Rentenmark;it must have oeen the inevitable effect of bringingemployment to a standstill in such trades as depend on imports of raw and semi-manufactured articles with the simultaneous effect of short time, or unemployment in thiscountry.   This aspect has been sufficient to shakeconfidence generally, and for the moment there is littlebusiness passing in wool,  tops or yarns in England.  Theexport business in piece goods is reported better&quot;.
