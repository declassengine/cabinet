A  copy of the Agenda of  the Session is attached as  an             appendix.                  The  only points arising  on which I need trouble my &apos;             colleagues  are Items 4 and 6  of the  Agenda  and the             question  of the settling  of the Agenda  of the  Eighth             Session of  the International  Labour  Conference,  1926,  which             may be  tentatively discussed  at the  Twenty-third  Session             of the  Governing  Body.                  Unless any objection Is  raised, it is  proposed  to             instruct  the British Government representative (probably             Miss Margaret Bondfield,  M.P., Parliamentary Secretary to.             the Ministry of Labour) on the following lines.             Institution of a  Commission for the  transfer of Social             Insurance Funds in Upper  Silesia:                  The  Governing Body has been asked  by Mr,Sokal,             representative of the Polish  Government,  to set up a special             Commission, as provided for under Article 312  of the Treaty             of Versailles, for the purpose of determining  the conditions             of the  transfer of social Insurance  funds in Upper Silesia.             The Office  proposes that  the  following  experts 3hould  be             appointed by the  Governing Body, In  addition to the             representatives appointed by  tho German and Polish             Governments -ms DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;3 GOVERNMENT.     Twenty-Third Session of the Governing Body of the International                 Labour Offloe, Geneva, June, 1924.     PROPOSED INSTRUCTIONS TO THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT REPRESENTATIVE.
   Senator Mario Abblate, former Minister of Labour,         Senator of the Kingdom of Italy;   Mr. Anders Lindstedt, Chairman of the Royal Insuranoe         Council of Sweden, Stockholm;   Mr. Christian Moser, Professor of the Science of         Insuranoe at the University of Berne.The British Government representative will raise no objectionto the proposed exports.   So far as oan be ascertained atpresent, th8 Intornational Labour Office have received nooommunloation on this subject from the German Governmentand the British Government representative will enquire whether the Gorman Government is prepared to appoint a-member on the proposed commission, but she will bear in mind that, under article 312 of the Treaty of Versailles, theGerman Government is bound to appoint suoh a member in anycase in whioh a special oonvention has not been concluded inaooordanoe with the third paragraph of the Article withinthreo months after the coming into force of the Treaty.High OommiBsariat for Refugees:     The Governing Body are to consider a proposal made bythe High Commissioner of* the Loague of Nations for Refugeesto the effect that thoro should be transferred to the Interna-tional Labour Organisation oertaln work in connection withrefugees whioh up  to now has been performed under the auepioesof the Secretariat of the League.     The information available is very soanty, but it seems clear that  the adoption of the proposal would result in an appreciable  increaso In the budget of the InternationalLabour Office.    (At the moment the proposal is merely thatthe  expenses  shall be borne on the budgot of the InternationalLabour Office instead of tho budget of the Secretariat, butit appears  likoly  that  a probable increase of work inoonnaction  with Armonian refugoes will result in larger fundsbeing required).
     The advantages of transferring the work from the secretariat to tho International Labour Office are not veryapparent, sinoe the question of making provision for warrefugees would seom to be a political rather than an industrialqueation and it is essential, for the suooesB of the Interna-tional Labour Organisation, that, it should avoid all politicalentanglomonts.   In any case, the Office would appear to be neither equipped nor designed to undertake certain executiveduties whioh tho transfer cf the work would appear to involve.     It is accordingly proposed that the British government representative should express her regret at being unable tosupport the proposed transfer.Agenda of the Eighth Session of the International LabourConference, 1926.     The British Government representative will suggest thatat the  1926 Session of the International Labour Conferencethere Bhould bo dlsoussod -      (1) the prevontion of industrial accidents;     (ii) method of fixing minimum wage rates;   (iii) the regulation of hours of labour in China,           Persia and Siam.The  last subjoct /which arises out of Article 11 of  theWashington Hours Convention - whioh stated that provisionslimiting hours of work in China, Persia  and Siam should beoonsiderod at  a future meeting of  the General conference)will not be prosaod,  or even  suggested,  if the effect is likelyto be to weaken the possibility of the  inclusion in  the agenda of the  first  or seoond subjects mentioned above.
