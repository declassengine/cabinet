CABINETE C RE T.HOME AFFAIRS COMMITTEE.1.342(24)WORKMEN1S COMPENSATION  (SILICOSIS) BILL.Memorandum by the Home Secretary,,      I desire to obtain the approval of the Home AffairsCommittee to the annexed Bill to amend the Workmen1s Compensation(Silicosis) Act, 1918.      That Act enables the Secretary of State to make Schemesfor the payment of Compensation to workmen in any specified                                            aindustry or group of industries involving exposure to silicadust who contract silicosis or silioosis accompanied bytuberculosis.  One such Scheme was made in 1919 for theRefractories Industries, i.en the group of industries engagedin getting and manipulating highly siliceous materials for usein the manufacture of bricks and other articles for liningfurnaces.  This Scheme was in the nature of an experiment and before embarking on Schemes for other Industries it was thought desirable that there should be an enquiry into its working.This enquiry was undertaken in 19 23 by a Departmental Committee,presided over by the late Parliamentary Under Secretary of state to the Home Office, and their Report was issued early this year.The main recommendations, which involve legislation, are that subject to power being given to suspend workmen suffering fromtuberculosis of the lungs apart from silicosis and the require-ment of a definite standard of respiratory physique in allworkmen newly engaged in the Industries, the special provisionslimiting the right to compensation in cases of silioosisaccompanied by tuberculosis  (see Memorandum prefixed to theBill)  should be abandoned, and that a Medical Board should beset up to take over the duties under the Scheme now carried
9S.15-6.   out by the local Tuberculosis Officers.  The object of the   Bill is to enable effect to be given to these recommendations.         These proposals should prove advantageous both to   employers and workers, and I do not anticipate any opposition   to the Bill.  The Directors of the Compensation Fund who   represent the employers are prepared to accept the   recommendations and no criticisms or objections have been   received from any of  the Trades Unions affected.  As regards   the  suspension from employment of persons found on   examination to be suffering from tuberculosis, this is   essential in  the interests of the workers as well as of   the  employers, and all the workers&apos; representatives who   appeared before the Committee agreed to it.                                      A.  H.10th  June,  1924.

Worknien&apos;s  Compensation        (Silicosis)  Bill.                 MEMORANDUM.    The object of this Bill is to enable effect to be givento certain  recommendations  contained in  the first report of the Departmental Committee on Compensationfor Silicosis (published this year), which deals with theworking of the scheme  for the refractories industries,made under the Workmen&apos;s Compensation (Silicosis) Act,1918.    That Act gives power  to the Secretary of State tomake schemes  for  the  payment of compensation toworkmen who contract silicosis or silicosis accompaniedby tuberculosis, but provides that, in  cases of  silicosisaccompanied by tuberculosis, (a) no compensation shallbe allowed unless the silicosis was  so  far advanced as tomake  the workman specially liable  to  tuberculosisinfection or, though not so far advanced,  was  likely to accelerate materially the progress of the disease; (b) lowerscales of compensation may be fixed.     The Committee find that the presence of silicosis inany  degree  renders the workman  specially liable totubercular infection, and that in  the great majority ofmixed cases the  silicosis  precedes the  tuberculosis andpredisposes  to it.   In these  circumstances they recom-mend  that  the special provisions  in regard to thetreatment of mixed cases  of silicosis  and tuberculosisshould be abandoned, and  that, subject to power being given to the medical officers to suspend from employment workman  found to be  suffering  from  tuberculosis(without silicosis) or found at the first  examination notto reach a prescribed standard of iBOopuatory physique,cases of the combined  disease should  be compensatedand otherwise  dealt with in the  same way as those ofpure silicosis.  The amendments of the Act proposed inparagraphs (1), (2) and (4) of clause  1  are  designed forthe  purpose of giving effect to these recommendations,both in the existing scheme for the refractories industries and in any future schemes made for other industries.     Provision is also made in accordance with recom-mendations  of  the Committee  by  paragraph (3) for     78-3              , a
