mi(This document is the&apos; property of His Britannic Majesty1s Government.).THE CHANNEL ISLANDS AND THE ISLE OF MAN.               Memorandum by the Home Secretary.      The Geddes Committee of 19 22 suggested that the  Governmentshould consider the question of inviting the Isle of Man and theChannel Islands to make appropriate contributions towards the costof the war.   The matter was discussed between the Home Office,  theTreasury and the Lieutenant-Governors concerned, and as a result inJanuary 1923, a letter was addressed by the Home Secretary to eachof the three Islands inviting each Island,- by desire of HisMajesty&apos;s Government, to consider making an annual contribution tothe Imperial Exchequer.      There are very strong grounds for asking for these contribu-tions.   Except for some small contributions paid during the War the islands have escaped the financial burden of the War,  and in faothave profited from the War.  The internment of Aliens  in the isle of Man meant the expenditure of large sums locally, and the channel islands profited from the high prices obtained for their marketproduce.  Moreover, the Imperial Government paid separation allowances to the dependants of the Islanders serving with theForces, and have since paid and are still paying pensions to theex-service men and their dependants in the Islands.      As regards the amount which each Island might he expected tocontribute, the Treasury made  a calculation showing what would be ftcestimated yield if the British taxes were applied to eaoh of the islands.  According  to these calculations Jersey might be expectedto  contribute  325,000 a year  and  Guernsey  275,000 a year.  Asregards the  Isle of Man, where there is a considerable AccumulatedFund,  it was suggested that they might contribute  150,000 a yearand pay at once a  lump sum of   100,000.B 0 R E T.HOME AFFAIRS COMMITTEE.P. 389 (1924)CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE IMPERIAL EXCHEQUER FROM
      Replies have  now been received from each of  the  Islands.Jersey has. declined to contribute anything declaring that  theycannot &quot;even if the financial position of the  Island did not prevent it undertake to make a contribution without violating the recognised privileges, franchises and immunities of the  Island  andthe fundamental prinoiple that no tax can be levied by the states for other than Island purposes&quot;.      Guernsey has  offered to pay a lump sum of  220,000 as a contribution towards the pensions payable by the British Governmentto Guernseymen.  The Isle of Man have offered to pay a lump sum of 200,000 subject to two conditions - (1) that the  Island is givencomplete financial  autonomy;  and (2) that the Crown lands valuedby the Treasury at   116,000 and by the local legislature at  75,000be handed over to the Island.  The result therefore is that on theIslanders&apos; own estimate of the value of the Crown lands they are -prepared to make one payment of  125,000 in place  of the annual contribution of  150,000, plus a lump sum of  100,000 asked for byHis Majesty&apos;s Government.      I do not think that the offer of either the  Isle of Man orof Guernsey can properly be accepted by His Majesty&apos;s Government.The Isle of Man offer bears no relation to the resources of the island, which has an Accumulated Fund of  321,000, and it would be undesirable to enter into any bargaining as to constitutional changes.  Even if constitutional changes were desirable, HisMajesty&apos;s Government obviously ought not to sell concessions tothe Island,      Nor is the Guernsey offer - although^ made in a better spiritthan  that of the Isle of Man - adequate.  We probably cannot expect the Islands  to contribute their full shares in accordance with theTreasury Estimate,   but  the  lump  sum of  220,000 Is so far below theTreasury  estimate of   275,000 a year that it cannot be considered.      Moreover, I -think  there would be strong objections to thepolicy  of  accepting contributions from the  Isle of Man and fromGuernsey  and of allowing Jersey  to escape with no  contribution at all.
      In these circumstances I suggest that the Government should appoint a small Commission - of say three persons - to consider whatcontributions the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands ought inequity,to make towards Imperial funds and what arrangement shouldbe made between the Imperial Government and the Insular governments for the payment of such contributions.  If the Commission could bein form a Committee of the Privy Council it would probably be an advantage, as the Privy Council has always been recognised as having a constitutional responsibility for the affairs of theChannel Islands.      I am hopeful that such a Commission would come to an agreementwith the Island Authorities as to the amounts that should be paid and that the  Islands would make the agreed payments voluntarily.Failing, however, suoh agreement, it would be the duty of theproposed Commission to explore the difficult questions involvedin any form of compulsion and to make some recommendation.      The total amount of money involved is  comparatively small,but in the present state of the national finances, we cannot afford to neglect even small  sources of revenue, and moreover,the question  of principle Is  one of  some importance.  It  seems,to me  that the only alternative to the proposal I  make would beto reject the offers  of Guernsey and  the Isle of Man  and  to allow the whole matter  to drop.   Seeing, however,  that His  Majesty&apos;sGovernment have asked for a contribution and that on  the meritsthere  are very  strong grounds for  expecting  these  lightly  taxedIslands  to  contribute reasonable  sums, I do  not feel  that  theGovernment would  be  justified in dropping  the whole matter.                                      A. H.8th July,  1924.9T38-4G.
