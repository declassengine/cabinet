AMENDMENT BILL.Memorandum by the Home Secretary.v- ft,      Standing Committee &quot;A&quot; practically completed on 5th Junetheir consideration of the Bill and have adjourned until Thursday19th June when it is expected that the Government will make astatement on certain matters which many members regarded as ofmaterial -^jnportanoe in connection with any large increase ofthe electorate.      The Bill as amended continues the business premisesfranchise and the present occupational basis of the localgovernment franchise;  and its amended franchise proposals areas follows:-   1. A woman is qualified at 21 for residence, or her ownoccupation of business premises of  10 annual value preciselylike a man.      A married woman whose husband is qualified for thebusiness premises franchise is also entitled at 21 to be a parliamentary elector for the premises.      (These qualifications are in substitution for the present   qualification of a woman at 30 by reason of her own or her   husband&apos;s occupation of land or premises which if not a   dwelling house must;.be of  5 annual value).   2. A woman becomes entitled at 21 to the university franchise.   3. A man whose wife is entitled to the business premisesfranchise by her own occupation of the premises is entitled tobe a parliamentary elector for the premises.   4. A married woman is qualified at 21 instead of 30 for thelocal government franchise in respect of premises in the
ocoupation of her husband, and the present condition that both must reside there is repealed (women occupiers already possess this franchise at 21 like men).   &apos; 5. Where a person succeeds to property by descent,marriage, devise, etc. he will be qualified althoughhimself in occupation only  for part of the six monthsqualifying period.       These changes would according to the estimate of the registrar General, Increase the female Parliamentaryelectorate of Great Britain at least by 4,600,000, andpossibly by as many as 5,000,000.       The conferring of the parliamentary franchise on thehusbands of women occupiers of business premises is of little practical importance.   Judging by experience inthe City of London, not more than.from three to fourthousand men in Great Britain would be qualified through their wives.       In the course of discussion upon the Bill 1 under-took to consider certain questions which were specificallynamed in debate, e.g. redistribution and the statutoryscale for candidates expenses;  and to make a statement onthese matters upon the resumption of the Committeeproceedings.                      Redistribution.       It was suggested in Committee that so great anextension of the electorate called for the appointment ofa Commission to consider the redistribution of seats;   andan amendment is under discussion to establish such aCommission and to enact that the franchise changes do  not become operative until either redistribution has takenplace or both Houses resolve that it is unnecessary.       It appears, so far as the matter has at present been examined that the contemplated extension of the franchisethough largely increasing the  electorate in all
constituencies, will not materially enhance the disproportionately-portion which already exists between the numbers of theelectorates in different constituencies.   The 1918redistribution created a number of constituencies withconsiderably unequal population:  and the subsequentmovements of population, coupled with the unevenincidence of the 1918 franchise, has given rise to an even greater disparity in many instances between thenumber of the electorates in different constituencies.For example Hythe with a population of 50,500 had anelectorate in 1922 of.20,632, while Coventry with a population of 128,157 had an electorate in the same year of 60952.      It is doubted whether any strong demand for redistribution-tribution would have arisen so soon after 1918 on theground solely of these disparities;  and while as already stated, the provisions of the Bill will not materiallyenhance or multiply the conditions of disparity, it is aquestion whether the situation resulting from the Bill isone which calls for the reconsideration of the anomaliesalready in existence.      If the Cabinet took the view that redistributionshould be the subject of formal inquiry, it would benecessary to accept some such amendment as that put downto postpone the operation of the Bill (even though passed)until a Redistribution Act is passed or both Houses resolve&apos;that redistribution is unnecessary.   If the Cabinet took the contrary view, the opposition to the Bill will be greatly strengthened, and might prove fatal to itsprospects.                    Candidates Expenses.      In the course of the discussion, attention was called to the effect of the increased electorate on theexpenses of the candidates.   The present maximum following the recommendation of the Speakers Conference of 1917 is
-4-245the sura produced in a county constituency by 7d for eachelector and in a borough constituency by 5d for each elector,with an additional  75 in a county and  50 in a borough forthe election agents fee.   In a constituency of 40,000 electorsthe maximum amounts to  1160 in a county and  850 in a boroughand an average addition of 8,000 to a constituency with a present electorate of 40,000 would increase the maxima by  230and  166 respectively.   A suggestion was made by a member thata Select Committee should be appointed to consider thisquestion of expense.   In connection with the matter,  it may be mentioned that by the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, themaximum for all constituencies  in Northern Ireland was reducedto an amount produced by two pence for each elector.   some anxiety was expressed by members in debate at the prospect ofbeing ohliged to spend up to the legal maximum on the increasedelectorate at elections, and it will be appreciated that thispoint is not unconnected with the question of redistribution.                         Other Reforms.      I wish at the same time to mention certain other aspectsof electoral law which require consideration.      The Bill brought in this Session to establish proportional representation was rejected by a large majority, but it seemsvery desirable that the possibility of the adoption of somescheme to prevent members being returned by a minority of electors should be explored;  and in the course of the DebateI  intimated that the  subject would be fully considered by theGovernment and that personally I should like to see anotherSpeaker&apos;s Conference.      The use of private motor cars on behalf of candidates at elections gives rise  to serious criticism.   Whilst it may notbe  possible or desirable to prohibit the loan of cars forconveying voters to the poll, some means of preventing theunfairness of the  practice  as between the candidates ought tobe found.
9s.25-9.           in conclusion I  suggest  that,  if  the Cabinet agree     that all or any of these matters  deserve fuller  exploration,     they should be referred to a conference of representatives     of the several political parties  on  the lines of the     Speaker&apos;s Conference of 1917.                                         A. H.16th June,  1924-
