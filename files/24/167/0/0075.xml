BANKRUPTCY AND COMPANIES WINDING-UP (FEES) BILL.             Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.             At present, owing to the wording of section 90 (5) of the     Bankruptcy Act,  1914,  and Section 230 (3) of the Companies      (Consolidation)  Act,  1908, the administrative fees charged in     bankruptcy and in companies winding-up can only be applied to     pay  the costs  of the  bankruptcy and companies administration     respectively;  and in fixing the fees, account has to be  taken     of the  interest  on so much of the sums standing to the credit     of the  Bankruptcy Estates Account and the Companies Liquidation     Account as are invested from time to time.  Maintaining  separate     accounts  has caused Inconvenience in the past, as special  do-     cumstances may temporarily affect the costs or receipts  of one     branch  of insolvency  administration or the other, and the  fees     have  to be altered accordingly.           Por^the last few  years the bankruptcy fees  and interest  on     investments have been  Insufficient to meet the cost of adminis-     tration.   On the other hand in the oase  of companies  liquidation     there has been a considerable  profit, owing chiefly to the     interest  on various balances.           Bankruptcy  fees have  been increased up to the  limit  of     what  is considered reasonable.   The  fees in companies
liquidation, howover, havo not boen incroaBed since thebeginning of the war, and the oost of liquidation of a companyby an Official Reoeiver is now much less than that ofliquidation by an outside liquidator.  1 do not think this 1Bdesirable.     It is true that there may be some criticism of the Billon the ground that to increase fees in company liquidation isto.take more money, from traders, and on an occasion when thoyhave already Buffered loss through a oompany going into liquidation, but there is much to bo said for treatinginsolvency as a whole in this respect, and for having the board of Trado oompany liquidation fees on a scale comparable with that paid to outside liquidators.  It is accordingly proposed by the present Bill, both to merge the two accountsinto one, and also to provide generally that tho fees shall bobased on the costs of administration.     Clause 1 provides for the payment of the bankruptcy fees and investments dividends and the oompanies foos and investmentsdividends into one aooount, for the payment out of the accountof the costs of administration, and for the payment into theExchequer of any balanoe at the close of the financial year,after deducting ar* amount equal to one-half of the amount paid out during that year.  The last provision will enable asum of some  160,000 at present standing to the credit of theoompanies fees aooount to be released and paid into theExohequor.     Clause 2 provides for fixing the fees so as to meet the costs of administration.     Clause 3 provides for the presentation to Parliament of asingle annual aocount instead of the two now presented.     Clause 4 applies the Act to the fees charged and the costs
   incurred  in administering the Deeds  of Arrangement Act, which   are at, present dealt with in the same way  as  bankruptcy fees.        Clause 5 and the Schedule effect the  necessary repeals.        Tho Bill was prepared at the suggestion  of  the Treasury,   and thoy concur in itB terms.    Although,  as  I  have  said, there   is one ground of possible criticism that I  see,  there ought to   be no great difficulty in passing the Bill through its various.   stagesj  and I should be glad if it could be referred  to the   Home Affairs Committee now,  with a&apos;  view to its  introduction   and passage if possible before the ond of  the  Autumn  Sitting.

Bankruptcy and  Companies   Winding-up  (Fees)  Bill.                  MEMORANDUM.     At present the administrative fees charged in the two classes of insolvency, viz.:-bankruptcy and com- panies winding-up, can only be applied to pay the costs of the bankruptcy and companies administration respec-.,tively.  It is proposed by the present Bill to amalgamate the two accounts  so  as to avoid, as far as possible, the necessity of altering  fees to meet temporary variations in  the  costs or receipts  of one administration or the other.  It is also proposed to repeal the provisions under which account has to be taken of the interest on so much of the sums standing to the credit of the Bankruptcy Estates Account and the Companies Liquidation Account as  are  invested from time to time,  and to provide generally that the fees shall be based on the costs of administration.     It is proposed further to apply the Bill to the fees charged and the costs incurred in administering  the Deeds of Arrangement Act, which are at present dealt with in. the same way as bankruptcy fees.a
