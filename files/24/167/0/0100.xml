(ffilS POOUISKT IS TE3 PROPERTY 0? HI 3 3BIMIC MAJESTY1 S GOvTiRHMEMT) .SECRET ANDOONflDffi^ADCABINETO.P. 397  (24).ARRANGEMENTS FOR TIE  AUTUMN  SESSION,Memorandum by the Lord Privy Seal.     In accordance with the arrangement agreed at the lastCabinet,  (Conclusion 8 of Cabinet 40(24)), I circulate forthe Inf information of my colleagues a memorandum showing theamount of business which we hope to complete before theHouse rises next month, and the business to which we are committed and which must be dealt with upon the re-assembly. of.Parliament in the Autumn.     As regards the former, an agreement was recently reachedthrough the usual channels, but not without considerablenegotiation with the Conservative and  Liberal Whips,  who at  firstwere not prepared to render any assistance in the passage  of anumber of measures to which they ultimately agreed, which  areincluded in Appendix A to this Memorandum.   In addition tothe Bills  there shown I understand that the Opposition wouldnot object to our taking the 2nd Reading of the factories bill before the Hovse  rises, if tha Government really  press for this oourse.   &quot;ffliere is however the Money Resolutionrelating to Irish Free State Land -Purchase (Loan Guarantee), .which,  I am assured, is exceedingly urgent,  and the  Bill forwhich cannot be printed before the Recess unless theResolution is taken, and it may be thought preferable to find&apos;time for this Resolution rather than for the 2nd Reading ofthe Factories Bill before the House rises.
      It  is  impossible at this stage definitely to say on what  date the agreed bus iness shown in Appendix a will becompleted,  but the basis of our negotiations with theOpposition  Whips provided for the adjournment taking placeon the 8th  August.   She Opposition Whips will doubtlessassist the  Government in expediting business,  but though theycan influence their followers to a considerable extent,  anumber of back bench Members both of the Conservative and liberal parties may be the cause of a certain amount ofObstructiono   It would at any rate be  unwise to assume thatthis element will be entirely absent.   The largest  factor of doubt must however remain the House of Lords,  and until we seethe number and the nature of the amendments made by  the upper house to the important Bills, such as the London Traffic Bill,the Housing Bill, and so forth,  it will be  Impossible to saywith any certainty whether we shall ba  able to rise  on the datato whioh we are working *     I also attach Schedules showing the business which must stand over at least until the Autumnu         Appendix B shows Bills  which the Cabinet has decided                    are essentials         Appendix C shows Bills  whose passage  into law the                    Cabinet has  decided to be  highly desirable,                    though not essentialo         Appendix I) shows other  Government measures  already                    Introduced,  or approved and awaiting                    introductiono                    The information furnished  by Departments-                    in regard to some  of these Bills  is  scanty,                    and it may be  that some of those in  this                    Appendix ought to be in Appendix Co
            Appendix 3 shows  other  measures to which the                       Government  are  committed and which will have                       to  be  dealt  with  If they are in Ofxioe next                       Spring,  in  addition to the consideration of                       such Supplementary  Estimates aa nay be                       necessary, and  tho  essential Votes on Account                       for 1925/26  which must be taken before the                       31st March nexto        It will be  seen that  there  is a  subs tantial programme of   work whioh  we must carry out in  the Autumn, and  tha House   might perhaps re-assemble  on Tuesday, the 21st October,,   this   date is substantially earlier than  those fixed for tbs autumn   Sessions  of 1922  and 1923, as in the  former year the&apos;House was   adjourned until  the  14th November,  (it was actually dissolved   in October),  while In the  latter year it adjourned until the   15th November being  prorogued on the  16th of that month.   1920   and 19B1  however  offer  a close parallels as ori each occasion the   House re-assembled on the  Tuesday of  the third week in October,   whioh in  the  former  year was  the 19th, and in the latter w.as the   18th c  I do  no t believe that the other Parties in the House   would consent to  an  arrangement whereby the House re-assembled   on this occasion  before that time, and as their goodwill is   essential if&apos; we  are  to  get through our programme of minor   legislation,  I am satisfied,  that it would be most unwise to   attempt to  fix the date for  re-assembly before Tuesday,  the   21st October,.
