 [THIS DOCUMENT IS  THE PROPERTY  OF HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;S  GOVERNMENT], CP. 325 (24)                   CABINET.               Copy  No.   *^Qpi\Rr  I                     Sugar, Beet.QLU  II-*       MEMORANDUM  BY THE MINISTER OP AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES.           1,    I desire  to  call the attention of the  Cabinet to the      position of the Sugar  Beet Industry  in this country  in consequence      of  the reduction in the  Budget of the  Customs Duty on Sugar  from      25/8 per cwt.  to 11/8  per  cut.           2.    In  the Finance Act, 1922,  the excise duty,  which had      hitherto been charged  on sugar made  from beet grown  in this      country, was  removed,  with the result  that  the sugar  beet industry      has for  the last two years received  the equivalent of a subsidy      of  25/S  per cwt. of home grown sugar.           3.    This has  enabled the two existing factories, in one of      which the Government has invested  375,000, besides guaranteeing      for ten  years 5 per cent,  on the  shares subscribed by the public,      to  make  profits, and,  prior to the Budget,  projects were on  foot      for the  erection of new  factories in several parts of the country.      One new  factory is  actually in process of erection at Colwick,      near Nottingham,           4.    The reduction  in the Sugar Duty,  with the consequential      reduction in  the benefit  to home grown sugar, has destroyed any      hope of  securing the erection of  any more factories and will      make it  very  difficult for the two existing factories to continue      to  make  any profit.           5.    From the  agricultural point  of view it will be a serious      disaster If the hope of  establishing the sugar beet  industry in      this country  has to be abandoned. One of the principal causes      of  the decline of arable farming  is  the fact that the root crop,      which is an essential  part of any arable rotation, is so expensive      and so unremunerative.  If instead  of  mangolds or turnips farmers      can grow sugar beet under  contract on terms which give even  a      small profit  it will do  more than anything  else to maintain  arable      cultivation in many parts  of the  country.
     &amp;i   The industry is also of great importance from thepoint of view of employment.  It requires additional labour on the land in growing the  crop to the extent of one moreman for every ten acres of  beet, and the sugar factoriesemploy large numbers of men in the winter months.  Thetwo existing factories each employed from 600 to 700 menlast winter from October to February and about 50 men areemployed at each factory during the remainder of the year.     7,   I am satisfied that fresh capital will not beprovided for the erection of new factories unless some further assistance is given to the industry, and the only practicable method of assistance is by means of a subsidy for a period of years on a  diminishing scale.  It must take time before the farmers acquire the experience necessary tosecure the maximum yield of beet of high sugar content and before new factories reach  full efficiency.  Consequentlyin the early years the factories cannot, without assistance,pay a sufficient price for  beet to encourage the farmers to grow it.  It has been the universal experience in every other country that the industry cannot be established without some measure of assistance  in the early stages.     8.   I ask the-Cabinet therefore to agree to theprinciple of a subsidy in this special case.  The amount required can be settled in  consultation between the treasury and my Department, but I may say that at the outset Iestimate that while  it will not be necessary that thesubsidy should be as much as the industry enjoyed when theDuty was 25/8 per cwt. it will be necessary to give a subsidy of about 19/6 per cwt. of sugar.  I should proposehowever if this is done that the appropriate excise dutyshould be charged on home grown sugar, so that the&apos; whole ofthe State assistance should be provided under one head.     9.   In order to give  time for new factories to beestablished the subsidy should be maintained, at the same level
for four years, after which it could be reduced to 13/- percwt. for another three years,  to 6s.6d per cwt. for a further three years and then finally terminate.     101  The gross cost of a Subsidy on this scale duringthe current financial year is estimated to amount to  360,750,but against this Excise Duty at 9s.9d per cwt. would amount to 180,375, so that the net cost to the Exchequer would be 180,375.     11.  I should propose that the payment of the subsidy should be conditional on a reasonable price being paid to the farmers for beet, but the actual price would depend on the sugar content of the beet, so as to encourage good cultivation.     12.  I may add that a subsidy in this special case would receive considerable support from all parties in theHouse of Commons,  Many members of the Labour Party,  includingthe Prime Minister, pledged themselves to continue the high rate of assistance which was in force prior to the reductionof the Duty,  The whole of the Conservative Party will support a subsidy and several members of the Liberal Party, including mr.. F .D.  Acland, have expressed themselves in favour of assisting the industry.   If therefore the Government agreeto give a subsidy there is every prospect that it would becontinued by any succeeding Government during the ten year period.     13,  The Government has been able to do very little for agriculture and our Wages Bill will impose a further burden on the farmers.  I hope therefore that the Cabinet will agreoto this modest measure of assistance to encourage the developmentof one of the most hopeful possibilities in the industry.     14.  It may be asked why the Sugar industry cannot establishitself under ordinary conditions.  The answer is that it depends on reforming at the same moment another industry Q.f exceptional
conservatism, viz.- agriculture,  into which a novel-standardof skill has to he introduced.  The  experience  of  othercountries confirms this,   The example of Holland  shows that assistance was the road to a free trade industry.     15a  I have discussed this question with the  Chancellorof the Exchequer, and he agrees to the circulation of thismemorandum with a view to an early decision by  the Cabinet.                                    N. B.Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries.         30th May, 1924.
