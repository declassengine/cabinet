5 DOCUMENT  13 THE  PROPERTY  OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.                          0  A B IK E T.                          ----------                      r-               HOURS  OP INDUSTRIAL EMPLOYMENT BILL.           ;;JET&apos;&quot;            ------------------&apos; ---------&apos;------&quot;334 (24).           MEMORANDUM   BY  THE  MINISTER   OP  LABOUR.     While I appreoiate the difficulties outlined in thememorandum circulated by the First Lord of the Admiralty onbehalf of the Service Departments (CP. 327 (24)) I find it                  O       .                             * .1*&apos;-impossible to agree to the proposal that the arrangements for overtime working on orders for the fighting services should beleft entirely in the hands of the Departments concerned,     2.   In my opinion agreements under Clause 2 (5) of thoBill whereby the dally limit of hours may be waived providedthat the average hours, calculated over a period, do not exoeed4F- per week, should afford the elasticity required for theordinary day to day working of tho establishments concerned,while the concessions allowed for emergencies and exceptionaloases of pressure of work - apart from national emergencieswhich are provided for in Clause 10 of the Bill - are, I *believe, sufficiently wide to prevent any risk of interferencewith the efficiemoy of the Foroes of the Crown.   I am preparedto make any arrangement in reason provided the Departments areprepared to keep an average 48 hours woek.   If they are notprepared to do that, and to show an example to private employersobviously the Bill will be greatly-damaged.     3.   I feol that the course proposed by the First Lord, ofthe Admiralty would lay the Government open to the oharge that,while imposing definite restrictions on the working of privately owned undertakings, it had taken care to allow to its owna^tabliahmentB a considerably greater measure of freedom.   Itmust be rememberod that the greater part of the work performedin these establishments is also carried out in precisely similar                                              /oiroumstanoes
circumstances by private firms, and it will be argued withsome force that the faot of the Government making speoialprovision for its own industrial work is an admission thatthe Bill doss in faot impose excessive and burdensomerestrictions.    4.   The suggestion that private firms engaged on government work should be governed by one set of regulations for their private contracts and by another set, drown up by adifferent authority, for their Government contracts,  seems tome impracticable from the administrative point of viow, anditB adoption would make it almost impossible to secure thatthe statutory conditions were being honestly observed^     5.   I ought perhaps to point out that it is notoontempldted that undertakings should apply to my department for a permit to work overtime on each individual occasion thatthey desire to do so.   Regulations drawn up in consultationwith both sides of industry will define as far as possible theoiroumstances in whioh overtime under Clause 3 (2) (b) is permissible and will lay down the maximum number of hourBallowed within a given period.  I will gladly engage to consult the Departments concerned, before these regulations are issued,and will endeavour to meet their  -special difficulties, so faras I can, within the limits imposed upon me by the Bill.   Atthe same time, it will, of oourse, bo necessary always to be assured that the circumstances are suoh as to provide a defenoeagainst similar claims by outside undertakings.     6.   With regard to the tiecesmry workers in industrial undertakings, I do not think it is possible to exoludecaretakers, gatomen etc, from the scope of the Bill nor, asa matter of faot, was it the intention of those who framed theConvention that they should ho so exoludod,   I think, however.                                                     /that
ainlotry of Labour.3rd June,  1934&quot;.that it will be found that work of this kind oan properly bodoalt with as a permanent exception under Clause 3 (s)  (a).     7.   I a  not prepared at this moment to give a rulingon the position of the Ordnanoe Depots, but I may perhapspoint out that if (as I believe is the oase) a considerableamount of repair work is carried on there, they would appearto be covered by Clause 1 (2) (b),     P.   With regard to tho last paragraphs of the FirstLord&apos;s Memo,   I propose to strike out the word &quot;roononaible1in tho first line of Clause 7 (b) and thus exclude from theBill foremen who are not usually employed in manual labour.     I alse propose to amend Clause 7 (o) so as to exoludemen employed in tugs and dredging craft in aooordanoe with asuggestion made by the Board of Trade.                             (Intel.)-T. S.
