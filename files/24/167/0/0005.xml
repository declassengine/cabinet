THIS  DOCUMENT  IS THE  PROPERTY OP HIS  britannic  MAJESTY&apos;S  OOVSRMMEMT).SECRET.CP.  505  (24).                               CABINET.                       MAH0HE6TJ3R  -  COVSMTRY MOTORWAY.                     Memorandum by the  Lord Privy Seal.             My colleagues are probably aware that  Influential        backing among members  of all parties has been secured In        support of the projected Motorway between Manchester and        Coventry notwithstanding the fact that Its promoters were        unable when they submitted their proposals to satisfy the        Trade Facilities Act Advisory Committee as to the soundness        of the financial aspect of their scheme.   On Thursday last        I received a Deputation of members of  the House of Commons        and others interested in the project - and I now circulate        a copy of the shorthand notes of the speeches from which It        will be seen that the principal  request  put  forward by        Sir Leslie Scott, Mr. 1&apos;illett, Sir William Joynson-Hicks and the        other speakers  was that the Government  should accord        facilities in the House for the  discussion of the Motorways        Bill.             I was considerably Impressed by the arguments brought        forward in support of the  view that the  ordinary process of        Private Bill  legislation was  not properly applicable In  a        case of this  kind and constituted  an unnecessary burden  on        those interested  In the suggested Motorway;  and  the point        on which I desire a  decision  of  the  Cabinet  is whether,        should the state  of  Government business  permit,  facilities
should, be granted for a discussion of the Bill In the Houseof Commons,   This might perhaps be done on a Friday towardsthe olose of the session.   The grant of facilities of thiskind would not imply any acceptance by the Government ofthe actual scheme; but .*ould merely serve-  the purpose ofgiving the House an opportunity of discussing the novel, and,as I believe, important principle of the construction ofMotorways on the great Commercial routes in different partsof the country.

         SIR LESLIE SCOTT :  j think you will appreciate why wehave come to you, Mr.  Clynes;  it is essentially a non-partydeputation.   The support of the Bill, which-I had the honour of introducing under the ten minutes rule, comes from all three parties equally, and the scheme is put before you on broad publicgrounds and upon no other.     If it be suggested that this isthe sort of subject that night be dealt with by Private Billlegislation, the answer is that but for one fact,  it could havebeen dealt with by that   method,   a:id that fact is that underthe standing orders of the House  a  motor-way is treated asa railway, and 5S: deposit on the total anticipated expenditure is required in advance before the Bill can be introduced.  As,in this case, the expenditure is between  6,000,000 and  7,000,000,  ,a deposit of over  3c1,000 would have been necessary, and I am quite-sure that you. will appreciate that in a new scheme of the kind,before-feeBill has become an Act of Parliament, it is quite out of   /the question to raise so large a Bum as that.   Therefore, the     [ipromoters, as you know,  - because ^it was on the same lines thatyou introduced a Bill youself last Autumn - decided that someother method must be adopted.   The matter was considered very carefully, as you know,  and it was decided that the only thing to do wa9 to introduce a public Bill applying generally to motor                                                                   I,ways and authorising an Order to be made by some authority in viewof the merits of the particular Scheme asked for by the promoters of that Order.    That le the. scheme-that has been adopted withthis Bill.  Objection was raised to the form of your Bill, whichwas that the Ministry of Transport should have authority to makea Departmental Order, and it was said that, as the subject matter was so new, a moare Parliamentary authority than that was required.  JThe promoters of this Bill,.therefore, adopted a proposal, that,as a matter of fact, was put forward by the Committee of which Ihad  the honour of being Chairman during the War,  the Land                                                       Acquisition
Acquisition Committee.   That Committee published fourreports, three of which are now on the Statute Book,  let mesay, and this was the fourth - that Private Bill legislation might be appropriately considered by a Joint Committee of.the two Houses who would have power to make an order,  subjectto approval by Parliament.   That is the scheme proposedhere, and it is one which ensures the fullest possible investi-gation of the merits of any particular proposal,  and after  thatinvestigation the question as to how the scheme,  if adopted,will pay and how it is to be financed can properly be  considered.It. is very important to bear in mind that Parliament,  in givingassent to this Bill if it became law, would not be committing themselves in any way whatever to the particular scheme which,as a matter of fact, is the only one in the field at  thepreseni day, namely, the road from Coventry round Birminghamto Salford.   The case for that is that everything is  ready,  thatit goes through the most populous parts of the whole  country,and it is believed  on credible statistics that there  is a large volume of traffic, roughly speaking, along the lines  of routeof the proposed motor way and a real demand for it.   Everylocal authority on the line of route has been approached and practically the whole of them have passed unanimous resolutionsin support, and there has been no single opponent - not one ofall the local authorities.   It is thought  that the scheme,  if adopted, would give employment  to a large number  of peopledirectly and indirectly.    I was instructed,  on proposing theBill,  to say 40,000, but  the promoters,  in  order  to be  quite sure that they are on the safe  side,  instruct  me  to-day to  say25,000,  directly and indirectly,  for two or three years.   Thewhole of the plans are ready, the  whole  of  the land has  been,for practical  purposes,  surveyed,  work  can  bo  started the
moment -an Order- isjaade -carrying it out.   Therefore,  inview of the state of employment in the country&apos;ajjd the extreme importance of doing everything to facilitate trade,  it is submitted that the proposal is one which deserves trie&apos; verysympathetic consideration of His majesty&apos;s Government from thepoint of view of finding time in Parliament.        The object of this deputation is to ask you  to find thenecessary time for the discussion of the Bill;  That is our object.
It is quite obvious that if it remains a Private Bill nothing morecan be done with it this session.   That is perfectly plain, butwe appeal to you to find, sonehOT/ or another, the necessary time forthe discussion of a Hon-Party Bill  which is supported by all parties!I would ask at least for the second reading at an early date if youare not prepared at this moment to commit the G-overnmsnt to see theBill through all its stages, as we should like.   On the secondreading debate you would be able to judge whether the bill is one for which you could find time;  you would hGar it citicised,  andany opposition that there may be to it would there make itselfmanifest.  We do therefore ask you to say that you are satisfiedthat this is a scheme which is capable of giving great help to thetrade of the country, capable of assisting greatly towards thesolution of unemployment, and that under the circumstances it is right that, somehow or another, time should be found for it andthat the procedure suggested is the only procedure available underthe oiroumstanoes.       &quot;cabinet msf-a&amp;d two words only.  Had it bean a road it could havebeen sanctioned by an order under an existing Hoad Act.,  Had it beena light railway it could have been sanctioned by an order under an existing statute.&quot; Had it been a railway it could have been sanctioned by an order under an existing statute.    But the morochance that it happens to be a motor way, and not any one of thosethree, prevents the application of the existing machinery whichhas been approved by Parliament for dealing with proposals of thiskind by means of an order, and&quot;it enforces upon the promoters theprohibitive cost and delay of going by Private Bill procedure.  Ifwe are driven to Private Bill procedure we must do our best somehowor another, but it hangs up the whole scheme for at least another                                                          year,/
year,  and the men who are wanting worlc in the Midlands will notwait another year.        That is, baldly, the case.  You know tho members oi theDeputation,and it has very strong backing.  Lord Montagu is here,some of the great firms of the country, Messrs. Armstrong Y/hitworth,for example, are backing the scheme very strongly.  Mr.MarshallStephens represents the keen anxiety of the Ship Canal to see this bill carried,and the representatives now in your room really dorepresent a very important body of opinion in this country.Alderman Carter of Manchester, and the Vice Chairman of the manchester Ship Canal Directorate,is also here.  I do not knowwhether you would like to ask any questions?
     iiE. OLYISS:   I see that amongst those who are to speak thename of idr. Masterman is -mentioned.     SIR L3S1I2 SCOTT:   Both he and Sir William Joynson Hickswanted to he here, hut they have not yet heen able to come.         C1YH3B:   I should he glad to hear anything else which you would like to say.     iiE. BID!&apos; TI1L3TT:   I am in agreement with what has heensaid, well knowing how difficult it is for you to find time toisuch a,measure;  hut the measure is sufficiently important to warrant asking you to oonsider very seriously the claims we are putting forward.   I myself am concerned from the iahour stand-point.   I know that it will he a permanent saving to life, youwill facilitate traffic, and you will increase the speed by                                   iseparating the traffic on the motor way from the ordinary road traffic.   I think, when you realise the uses to which our roadsare being put, roads which are hundreds of years old and whichhave been called upon to bear the&quot; strain of the most modern and&apos;highly developed internal combustion engine.-iand  their  loads,  the-jrcposet&apos; motor way would add considerably to economy in transport,which is undoubtedly of enormous importance in developing thetrade of the country, both internally and from the dooks.   Thedoors are particularly anxious about this scheme.          So far as I have ascertained, there has been no serious objection tak%n to the ssheroe from any Trade Union orfrom any local body.          The chief points in favour of t.,.:e scheme are that itwould relieve t :.e ordinary reeds of a tremendous amount oftraffic  it wouL?promote still gieater economy, and I am sureit would add considerably to the saving of life as a road wouldbe specially built for the specific purpose of motor traffic                            &apos;    -  6 -
by road.   If authority were given for the construction of the&apos;road a considerable number of the unemployed would be relievedand I am sure the effect would also be to revive a considerable interest in trades lying along the route.          My three points are that I believe the road to be an urgent necessity, I am sure it would help the unemployed, andthat it would improve and cheapen locomotion.   I heartilysupport what has been said0
                                                                si d             SIR WILLIAM JOY^SOU-HICKS:   I may say that this schemecame before me when I was. Minister of Health, and on the UnemploymentCommittee in the last Government we v,*cr.t into it rather fully.  Atfirst sight one was inclined to oppose  it because it was a new idea -a read with colls of this character.    It was a new scheme, a newidea, just as new,  perhaps,  as railways were when first contemplated,but, after very full consideration, from the point&apos; of view of thecountry,  I came to the conclusion that  it would be really mostimproper  for the Government of the day  to try and prevent it in anyway, which they would do if they did not give it facilities fordiscussion.   I mean to say that a Bill of this kind simplycannot pass, as far as I can gather,  under the ordinary Private.Bill procedure, and I think this new scheme is of such greatimportance that it does require special investigation by aCommittee set up in the way suggested under this Bill.  It wouldprovide an enormous amount of work, the very kind of work whichcould be  most easily done by the&quot;unemployed,  and the mere.factthat tolls are to be charged to my mind is nothing more than thefact that tolls are charged on a railway;  no one is bound topay the tolls unless they want to;  no  one need go on the road;it is merely an additional facility for providing traffic between certain points of the country,  Coventry to Manchester,  exactly the same  as additional facilities might be provided by railway.                     yho one need use the road if he does not want to,  and theresponsibility whether it proves a success&apos;or not is on the promoters themselves.   The scheme, when it was put to me - I donot know  whether any changes have been made since - involved theprovision of a considerable sura of money by the promoters,  theirown money which they are prepared to risk in this scheme.   that being so,  I do  ...  think it is of &apos; sufficient importance as anational  scheme for the Government to consider it,  because ifthis is a success I want you to realise that what we are puttingbefore you is really something like an original railwayscheme.         I have no doubt that the- p -
Government of that day feared that a scheme  for building a railwaywould turn out a failure.    That  proved a success,  and railways  are all over the country.    If this proves a success,  it will not doubt be the precursor of  a new opening up of the  country by meansof main roads fitted for.modern traffic.   The ordinary road ofto-day is not so fitted.   The Minister of Transport, I am sure,would agree that present-day roads are not fitted  for the heavytraffic which they have to bear and will have increasingly to&apos; bear.I do hope, therefore,  that you will consider the possibility of finding time for at least  the second reading debate in the House,and then, if it could possibly be managed, of getting it before  socesuch Committee as has been suggested.          MR. MASTEHMAN:  I do not doubt that everything I shouldhave said had I been, here  earlier has already been put: forward.   Ispeak for a good many of my own people who are entirely in sympathy with the request made to you about this Bill,   The two points which occurred to me are, first, if-I may say so,  we would expect moresympathy from yourself than from any other man in the House ofCommons on this subject;  because, during all the  years when you andI were both frequent contributors to the Press, no one moreexpressed in the Press the belief that this is a real way of dealingwith the unemployed problem.  You and I, often in the Bame  .newspaper, condemned relief works, we were dissatisfied with the&quot;dole&quot;, we did no  want anything in the nature of definitelyemploying men who had been reduoed to a condition of pauperism,  oranything of that sort, we both said &quot;Let us find work of national importance which will be of permanent benefit to the country;   then take on men to do that work, and automatically you will relieve the problem of unemploymentM.   So that we should suggest that as you are looking around for work of national importance - and in finding it you would have the support of all Parties in the House -we cannot conceive any better way of dev^xrp&amp;ng the countrythan  this motor  road system    which    had been
placed &quot;before you,    I will not go into the details of the ManchesterCoventry scheme,  although I &quot;think that should appeal to you,  as itdoes to roe as a Manchester Member;  &quot;but,  on the general principle,there is no doubt at all that in spite of the criticisms which havebeen made by the railway companies^  and a few other people who wouldnot care to see this motor road system developed, there is no doubt at all that this quick and new method of transport, from all  theevidence I have seen, would not only pay but would make for. thegeneral efficiency of all the other industrial conditions of  thecountry,            The other point I would like to speak personally  upon isthat there is an idea that there should be opposition to this Billbecause it does away with the apparatus of the ordinary private member Bill in respect of every scheme.  If for no other reason, Ishould very much urge upon your consideration the desirability of this bill for that very reason, because,  if there is anything moredisastrous to all the Developments which we desire, it is theapparatus of the passing of a Private Bill.  I speak with deferencein the presence of Sir Leslie Scott, but I have studied the subject and have written about it, so I cannot withdraw from it.  The amountof money and time &quot;that is wasted by the ordinary apparatus of aPrivate Bill passing through Parliament under the conditions  of thePrivate Bill Committee, and. so on, is always hampering every  kind ofdevelopment of this sort.            Therefore, because I believe you would have very  greatsupport from Parliament, andbeoause I believe this would make for thedevelopment of British transport, and because I know it is along theline of your own thoughts and what you have advocated as the  only right and proper solution for the welfare of the unemployed.  I would urge you to consider whether ycu cannot,  even in a crowded Session,give time to permit of its being passed,    and  to   consider
all the technical details which other gentlemen at  this  meetingare much more able to argue than I myself.   In any case,  Iwould guarantee to use what influence I could to make  the  matternon-controversial as far as our Party is concerned,          LORD M02TTA&amp;U:  It is very kind of you, Mr. Clynes,  toreceive us this afternoon.   I have been connected with thisenterprise from the very beginning, and it has always, been atheory of mine that sooner or later we must- have in this country a system of tolls, at any rate for heavy traffic, unless we wishour roads to become so expensive that neither the State  nor theratepayer will be able to foot the bill.          In order to remove from your mind any idea that  this isa private road for eventual private profit for ever and ever, Imay say -that from the very beginning my friends and myself haverealised that a clause must be put in by which the State shall been abled to take over the road on some basis such as the Gladstoneclause in the Railways Act of 1844, in order that those who wisheventually that we should have national roads in this country mayattain that end without any difficulty in regard to this road.          Our road traffic, as you know, is increasing at  the rateof over 20% per annum.   If you can visualise what that will  mean in a few years&apos; time, I think you will recognise that on thatground alone a strong case exists for the construction of a road from Birmingham and the Midlands through the Potteries to the manchester Ship Canal and the north, and because inadequate  as thepresent roads are on that particular line of route, it is obviousthat in a few years&apos; time they will be still more inadequate  andsomething will have to be done.          There is also the question of cost to local authorities,County Councils,&apos; District Councils and others,  on the line ofroute, because the cost of road making and repair is going up ever;year.   Whether you take Staffordshire or Hampshire or Horthumber&quot;land or London, the cost of roads increases   every   year ,                           :;  11
and at the moment it is quite clear that if you wish ta putmore heavy vehicles, whioh are necessary for trade,  on theroads, some arrangement must he made whereby, in return forthe withdrawal of speed limits and oertain weight restrictions,they are willing to pay on their side something for  a motorway which will give them those conditions.   So that I think,on that ground alone, you would find that the attractive aspect of the road to mechanical traffic, in the saving of  time and money in various ways, will induce a great deal of traffic toleave the existing roads and go upon the motor ways          I do not know that Ifeave anything more to say, except to thank you very much for reoeiving us this afternoon,  I hope,,as other speakers have said, that you will be able to give timefor this Bill to be read a second time,          sir LESLIE SCOTT:   I might perhaps say, firstly,that the Committee to whioh I referred, the Land AcquisitionCommittee, expressed a strong view identical with that ofMr0 Masterman as to the delays and expense cf the Private Billprocedure,   Secondly, the promoters in this case, as showingtheir belief in the scheme, have already spent over   30,000  in getting everything ready to go ahead with the least  delay0IS
          HP;  CI.YESS;    Sir Leslie Scott,  Lord Montagu,and Gentlemen;   I accept the view that this Bill doesstand outside the range of projects usually covered by private Bills, but that is a personal acceptance and itmust not be taken as committing the Cabinet, on whosebehalf I am meeting this deputation.          The project is so novel and so large that thequestion of facilities is one big enough for cabinet decision, so  that I cannot this afternoon go to the lengthof promising  to afford facilities for the discussion of this bill in the House of Commons.   Personally, I accept theview that this is a great project upon which I thinkjtheHouse  of Commons  should be given an  opportunity of expressingits  opinion,  and  I *will represent that view to my colleagues,together with the general  statements which  you have made.I want  to thank you for those  statements and io say that asI have  listened  every  speaker  has put before me either anew  point or  a new  set of  points.    No one  has gone overground  which  had  already been  covered.   I  do not knowwhether it  was a  patriotic  inspiration which caused someoneonce to say that  trade followed  the  flag.   I am not disputingthat statement,  of  course,  but in these days I  think it isequally true  to  say that  trade follows in  the wake  oftransport facilities,  and  I  can  well see  that much would emerge of general benefit to  trade and  commerce, and to theworking classes,  from  the  construction and  development of greater facilities  such as those which we are considering this afternoon.
          I think that nothing whatever has he en said ordone &quot;by any member of the present Government to  put  this project aside on any ground of principle.   I have read thestatement made by my colleague. Mr. Gosling, speakingsometime ago on behalf of the Ministry of Transport,  and  sofar as there was criticism it was not criticism offered onthe grounds of any objection in principle to the project  ofthis Bill.          I observe with great pleasure the thoroughlyrepresentative character of this deputation, mixed as it  is fully in respect of parties,  and I note also that among the names of Members of the House of Commons who have signifiedtheir approval to this project there is to be found  a verylarge number of Labour Members,   They naturally, likemyself, have an eye upon the opportunities for employment which this undertaking would afford, but I vrould like the project to receive consideration on its general  merits,having as they do the closest relation to future transportconditions.  It is the business of Governments to lookahead, and I shudder to think of what living conditions would be like thirty years hence if for a considerable time we leave transport facilities generally as they are  to-day(hear, hear).   Really it is becoming unbearable in  some              vparts of the country.   Motor traffic is growing and growing,and must ever do, so that no man, I think, has a greaterembarrassment in respect of the problems which he has to handle than Mr. Gosling.   I am1 sure that he himself would welcome some opportunity being given to the House of commons to state its view and to give its opinion on this novelproposal.          This is not the place for discussing  bhe principleof the Bill, but on that principle I would like  to say this,                                             &apos;i          This
 This  is  a scheme-which should he  faced upon grounds  of     6)2-(f public necessity  (hear, hear),  and so faced I  should say that  if  the  State will not undertake what&apos; apparently is a national need,  then the State should afford some  reasonable accommodation and convenience for private  enterprise to take it  up.    On  the other  hand,  I should aay where ay oh  a need obtrudes itself and private  enterprise  is  unwilling,  then  it becomes  the  duty  of the State to  Intervene,    Either one or the other must take charge,,   That I think would  represent a view which my colleagues  would  share,           I  am pleased to observe that  this project  has the goodwill of  the local  authorities concerned, between the starting point and the finishing  point,,    I believe  some persons  have represented  that the attitude of  the local authorities  is prompted by self interest.  I cannot  see any self interest which a  local  authority might have  other than the interest of enlarging public  convenience and  meeting the needs of the people on whose behalf they have  to  act, They, of course, have this traffic and  transport problem before  them in very many ways,  I will  conclude now without  making further comments&apos;,  I can  leave  you with the assurance that I   &apos; have been much impressed  by what  you have  put  before me, and that I personally hope that  an  opportunity may be found later on for bringing this matter  before the  House of Commons;   and that view I  shall have pleasure in representing to my colleagues,           SIEy LESLIE SCOTT:   On behalf  of  the  whole deputation,  I desire to exoross a very  deep sense of our gratitude for the recession  you have given us, and for the broad,, big view of statesmanship  which  you have expressed  in your speech,  I think  that augurs very  well for our  country&apos; waen  a proolem 01  general national impertance  like this can he  considered,  as  you  have considered it.,  on absolutely non- party lines  in  the broadest measure of sympathy to all,         (The Proceedings  then terminated),
