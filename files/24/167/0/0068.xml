CIRCULATED  TO  THE  CABINET.&apos;            o ;[This  Document is  the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;^ Government.]303GERMANY. fO^ CJune 23. 1924-confidential^  dSECTION 1.[C 9665/9/18]                     No.  1.     Memorandum respecting ike Present State of Military Control in Germany.1    1. ARTICLE 203 of the Treaty of Versailles reads as follows :-        &quot; All the military, naval  and air clauses contained in the present treaty,    for  the execution of which a time-limit is prescribed,  shall be executed  by    Germany under the control of Inter-Allied Commissions  specially appointed    for this purpose by the principal Allied and Associated Powers.&quot;    Article 213 of the treaty reads as follows: -        &quot; So long as the present treaty remains in force,  Germany undertakes to    give  every facility for  any investigation which the Council of the League of    Nations, acting if need be by a majority vote, may consider necessary.&quot;    2. It is clear that the plan  contemplated by the  framers of  the treaty wasthat Germany would be disarmed in a few months by the Commissions of Controland that  any further steps  required to maintain that state of disarmament wouldbe taken  by the League of Nations, acting under article 213.  The  framers of thetreaty seem to have assumed also that the admission of Germany to the League ofNations would not  be long  delayed, and that she would wish to be, and would be,elected at an early date as soon as she had, in accordance with article 1 of theCovenant, given proof of her earnest desire to fulfil  all the obligations of the treaty,including Part V.  The object of  article  213 presumably (though  the wording is admittedly vague) was to give the- League power to enforce by investigation theprovisions of Part V, as being the scale of armaments binding upon Germany, both as an international obligation and as a regulation prescribed  by the  League  on germany&apos;s admission as part of a general scheme of disarmament.    3. Various causes have worked to frustrate the designs of  the  framers of thetreaty:     (a.) Germany has not shown good faith  in carrying out her obligations, and          there  are still a number of important  points  covered  by  the  &quot; time-          limit &quot; clauses which remain to be fulfilled.    (6.)  France has looked for, and largely found, every excuse for retaining the          Commission of Control.    (c.) Germany has  not yet been admitted to membership of  the League of          Nations.    (d.) The  Allied Governments vhave hitherto  doubted  the oapacity  of  the          League to guarantee that the armed forces of Germany do  not exceed          what is  allowed under the treaty.    4. In the summer of 1921 the execution of the military clauses of the treatyseemed to be approaching completion, and the Allies were faced with the prospectof having to withdraw the Commission of Control at no distant date and to leaveall future investigations to the League of  Nations, whose strength and  prestigewere not  at that  moment of a nature to satisfy them.  So they devised the idea of creating  an  inter-Allied  military  &quot;committee  of guarantee&quot;  to replace  theCommission of Control provided for by the treaty when the mission of the latter was finished, and to be a bridge between control by the Commission  of control under article 203 and  investigation by the League of  Nations  under article  213.Admittedly no provision for such a committee existed in  the treaty; it was  thusnecessary that Germany should accept it voluntarily.      2252 [11721A]                                                n
    5. The  main features of  the proposal  as  eventually put before the GermanGovernment on the 14th April, 1922, were:     (a.) The duties of the committee of guarantee should be to  guarantee  to the          Allied Powers  that the military clauses of the. treaty were faithfully          observed.  The proposed committee should  have the right to visit          any locality  in. Germany to inspect arsenals, military establishments,          troops, police, &amp;c.    (6.) It should continue  to  function until  the day when, in accordance with          article 429 of  the  treaty, the first  zone of occupation was evacuated;          the  Allied Governments should then examine  whether  the circum-          stances rendered its continuance necessary.    (c.) It would have its seat in Berlin, and its expenses (as opposed to those of          the  Commission of Control, which are paid by  Germany)  would be          borne by the  Allied Governments.    6. These proposals were further developed  in a second note  addressed  by theAllied Ambassadors in Berlin to  the German Government on the 29th September,1922,  to the  following effect:     The Allies would be prepared to replace the Military Commission of control by  a  committee  of guarantee  as  soon  as the  commission declared  that theexecution of the treaty  was so far advanced that final  settlement  was assured,and even before the terms of the time-limit clauses of  the treaty were fulfilled tothe letter, provided that Germany first accepted the  committee of guarantee.  Atthe same time they formulated the five most important points which, in the viewof the Allies, still remained outstanding.   They were :     (a.) Organisation of the police.    (6.) Completion of the transformation of the munition factories.    (c.) Surrender of the remaining excess war material.    - (d.) Delivery of statistics  of  German armistice war material and of German          war munition  factory production, required  to  check and establish the         - quantities of war material unsurrendered.    (e.) Promulgation of  the  legal and  administrative  measures  necessary in          order effectively to prevent the import and export of war material and          to put  the recruiting and organisation of the army in harmony with          the military clauses  of the treaty, especially in regard to the abrogation          of mobilisation measures.    7. This  offer was never accepted by the  German Government, who replied intwo notes, dated the 27th October, 1922, and the 10th December, 1922, respectively.In the former they said  they were ready to enter into  negotiations regarding thecommittee of guarantee;  in the latter they contended that disarmament  was complete up to and even beyond the  text of  the treaty, and  that compliance withthe five points would  endanger the economic life  and  maintenance  of  public security in  Germany.  The position  thus was  that the  negotiations for thesubstitution of a committee of  guarantee for the Commission of Control providedby the treaty came to a standstill.    8. To sum up the actual situation, the  general  position at the end of 1922was on the whole not unsatisfactory.  It is true that the time-limit clauses  of thetreaty, which the framers of the treaty had evidently expected to be complied withwithin three or four months, had not yet, three years  after  the  treaty came intoforce, been  completely  executed, and that  this was almost entirely due  to theunhelpful attitude of the German Government.   The  Military Control Commission,however, had been carrying out their duties uninterruptedly,  and appeared to havethe situation well  in hand.  They had  destroyed, or otherwise disposed  of, an immense  quantity  of German war  material.   (The latest  figures  available aregiven as Annex (A)  to  this&apos; memorandum.)  Indeed, in the  opinion  of  the WarOffice, as was definitely stated  in the British  House of Commons as long  ago asMarch 1923, the reductions  in the German army contemplated by the treaty, bothin respect of men and material, had  been so carried out as to constitute effectivedisarmament.  But, although Germany under  certain articles of the treaty couldbe considered as having been effectively disarmed  so far as actual  armament was concerned, there were other  points, notably the five points quoted above,  in which

But, although Germany under certain articles of the treaty couldbe considered as having been effectively disarmed so far as actual armament was concerned, there were other points, notably the five points quoted above, in which
she had not yet complied with her treaty obligations, and negotiations&apos; were inprogress with, the view; to ensure that  the control  of these  points should  becontinued with the least possible friction.    9. We  may  now return to the  narrative of  events, - The  Franco-Belgianoccupation  of  the  Ruhr  in  January  1923   unfortunately  marked  a new andretrograde stage in the history of German disarmament.  The situation completelychanged.   The German Government  took up the  attitude that  in  claiming  to occupy the Ruhr in virtue  of  their rights  under the Treaty  of Versailles  theFrench and Belgians were in fact acting contrary to  the treaty and that, therefore,Germany could not  be held to be strictly bound by it.  Passive resistance was organised and effective military  control ceased.  During the year  correspondencewas exchanged with the  German Government with a view to the resumption ofcontrol, but it soon  became evident that no practical result was possible untilpassive resistance ceased.  That happened  in September 1923 and  it was thenpossible to approach the situation afresh in the hope of continued progress.    10, The first  step was taken on the 21st November, 1923,  when a note was sent to the  German  Government announcing (not for the first time) that controlmust be resumed without delay.  Simultaneously, in view of the anti-French and anti-Belgian feeling  still  running high in Germany, the Commission of Controlwere given minute instructions to prevent the occurrence of vexatious incidentsand attacks  upon Allied officers carrying out inspections in the name of theCommission of Control.    11. A series  of  inspections was at last carried  out in  January 1924.  these were only of a  formal nature, the idea being  that  in the  light of the experiencethus gained the commission would be able to report on the general question of the resumption of effective control.  The German Government consented  to  theseinspections, but at the same  time informed the Commission of Control that,  while they were prepared  to help in completing  that  part of the commission^ task which the Governments considered to  be still Outstanding, the commission hadfinished its task  so far as it involved personal contact with the German militaryauthorities.    12. This attitude on the part of the German Government revealed a completemisunderstanding of the rights of the Allies under the treaty, and it was felt thatthe whole question should be cleared up.  The views of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwere accordingly communicated to the Allied Governments and were as follows:The Allies had the  undoubted  right under  the  treaty to maintain&apos;  the control commission in full  operation  until all  the time-limit  clauses had been fullyexecuted.  So  long  as the Control Commission  continued to function it was entitled to supervise all the military clauses  of the  treaty.  It was for the Allies,and for the Allies alone, to decide  when the time-limit clauses  had been fullyexecuted.  So  soon  as they were satisfied on this  point, they would report thefact to the Council of the  League, upon whom it would thereafter be incumbentto take such steps as might be  considered appropriate under article 213.   Suchwas the treaty position;  but against  this it seemed wise not  to insist on the strict letter of  the treaty but rather to  repeat the readiness of the Allies to acceptthe proposed  committee  of  guarantee or some  similar  body  in place of theexisting Commission of Control on  the same conditions  as had previously been laid down in the note of the 29th September, 1922, viz., as  soon  as the five points were on a  fair way  to settlement; a further condition should  be  added thatGermany should consent to a series of  preliminary stocktaking visits which wouldenable the Allies to assure themselves that Germany&apos;s state  of  disarmament wasthe same as when German  passive resistance  led to the suspension of control.    13. These views were practically adopted by the Allied Governments and ledto the renewal of  correspondence with  the German Government.  The  Alliedviews were  incorporated in a note, dated the 5th March, to which the GermanGovernment replied  on the 31st March.  The reply was  not  satisfactory, andamounted to an appeal to article 213.  Germany admitted that, so  far as the fivepoints were concerned, the Allies were  within their-rights in maintaining theCommission of Control.  But they contended that, apart  from these  five points,the work of the commission should long ago have given  place  to  some form  of supervision by the  League of  Nations under article .213.  In the  view of theGerman Government, the simplest solution would be to withdraw the Commissionof Control.and entrust the whole question (five points and all)  to a  commission under the League of  Nations.      [11721A]                                                    B 2
    14. These arguments were countered in  an Allied note of the  28th May, thegeneral tenor of  which was that the German Government appeared to misimder-stand the legal position under the treaty.  The Allies had the undoubted right tomaintain the Control Commission in full operation until  the time-limit  clauseshad been fully executed.   &quot;When the Allies were satisfied that this was the case they would report the fact to the Council of the League, on whom it would there-after be incumbent to take such steps under article 213 as might  be consideredproper or necessary.  The stock-taking inspections, proposed by the Allies, were asked for in order  to discover if  the military state  of Germany still justified alightening  of  control  by reducing  the  Commission  of Control. preparatory tohanding  over Germany to the League of Nations under article 213; they could be finished in three or four months if  no obstruction were met with and no  seriousbreach of the treaty discovered; they were, in no way intended  to  be a means of continuing full control indefinitely.  If Germany accepted the Allied offer, control would  be  limited   to  the  five  points after the  stock-taking inspections, if satisfactory, and the  Control Commission  would  then  be substantially  andprogressively reduced.  If the German Government refused  the Allied offer, full control would  have to be maintained under the strict terms of the treaty until allthe time-limit clauses had been fully complied with.    15. Meanwhile,  the  situation  was materially affected  by the  report  of  the dawes  Committee  of  Experts, which  was  presented  in  April.    This reportrecommended,  among  other things,  that  all  Germany&apos;s financial  obligations under  the treaty should be included in  one lump  sum, and that  sum fixed at adefinite figure.  In the past, one  of the  chief arguments  which the Allies couldurge in favour of the acceptance of a committee of guarantee had  been the factthat, whereas the Allies would pay  for the committee of guarantee, Germany herselfhad to pay for the Control Commission so long as it remained.   Under the Dawesscheme, this argument no longer carries any weight seeing that the cost of control is to be  met out of the lump sum paid by Germany to the Allies.   Conversely, itmay be said that it will now be  to the  interest of  the Allies  to  withdraw thecommission as early as possible,  and thereby secure a proportionate increase inthe sums available for purely reparation and other treaty payments.                              Present Position.    16. The position of the negotiations at the present moment is that the Allieshave requested  the German  Government to return  an answer to  their latest proposals (see paragraph 14) by the 30th June, and that the German Governmentare still  considering the  latter.  Since the original negotiations with the GermanGovernment were begun there has  been a fundamental change, and any attractionswhich  the idea  of a committee of guarantee may at  first have had for Germanyhave fallen to the ground.  The inducement of economy no longer exists, and it isnow a matter of indifference  to  Germany from  a financial point of view how long the Commission of Control remains in existence.  The only incentive now before the Germans  is the obvious desirability of removing the  constant  frictioncaused by the continued presence of a  large body of Allied officers throughoutGermany.  On - that  ground  alone  it ought to be  worth &apos; Germany&apos;s while todisplay complacency and to render the withdrawal of the commission possible bypromptly executing the remaining  time-limit clauses of the treaty without further delay.                              German Attitude.    17. The German attitude  will, however, presumably  be influenced  by thefollowing factors:     (1.)  She doubts whether the  French and  Belgian Governments have  any          intention of playing fair,  and  suspects that the  proposal for a series of          stocktaking visits is   merely  a pretext for  continuing full  control          indefinitely.   On this point the British Government have endeavoured          to reassure her.     (2.)  Germany has got out of the habit of submitting to inspection by foreign           officers owing to the suspension  of  control during the last eighteen           months.  This in itself  makes resumption of  control  more difficult.           Moreover, the parties  of  the  Eight, who  are  now  predominant, are           bitterly opposed  to any further inspections.
     (3.) On the other hand, Lord D&apos;Abernon has warned the German Government           that  if they  are  recalcitrant they may  well  be faced with Allied           sanctions.   The inevitable result of defiance on the part of Germany in           the matter of control would be that the French  and Belgians would           press for sanctions which might well lead to disaster for Germany.                               French Attitude.     18. From the French point of view, Germany has prevented  the control commission  from  exercising  control  for  eighteen  months, and  the FrenchGovernment have received report after report of an alarmist character both fromGeneral Nollet (the late chief of the Inter-Allied Military Commission of Control)and from  their High Commissioner at Coblenz.  These reports  have led them tobelieve, or at any rate to contend, that Germany is  at this moment  a militarydanger and that she is making no attempt, to fulfil any of her military obligations under the  treaty.     19. The French Government made  it clear last November that they would notnecessarily refrain from taking independent action if they could  not  induce their allies to join them in taking measures to enforce German disarmament.  It is well to recall that on the 21st  November, 1923 (the day when the Allied Governments,through the Ambassadors&apos; Conference, announced to the German  Government  the resumption of control), they made a formal  declaration reserving their right totake such  measures as might appear indispensable to assure  the security of France,if menaced by the attitude of Germany or by German military preparations contraryto the Treaty of Versailles.                               British Attitude.     20. The attitude  of His Majesty&apos;s Government is not  so clear-cut as either that of France or of Germany.  They desire to get rid of the Control commission as soon as is safely  possible, as being  both a source of  political friction andof expense; they  regard the withdrawal of  the  commission  on  reasonableconditions as a step in the  direction of the  restoration of normal  conditions inEurope.   But obviously before the commission can  properly be withdrawn  the outstanding  five points  must  be  satisfactorily  disposed  of.   His  Majesty&apos;sGovernment have subscribed to all  the various notes addressed to Germany, whichlay down clearly that these five points  must  be met.   Moreover, it must always be remembered that  military control was imposed on Germany with the definiteobject  of  preventing a further war.  The control cannot properly be withdrawnuntil His  Majesty&apos;s  Governments  military  advisers  are  satisfied  that it canbe  without  prejudice to  the  public interest.  On  the   other hand, Britishopinion is instinctively averse from using forcible methods to bring Germany toreason, and His Majesty&apos;s Government have consistently refused to say in advancewhat action  they were prepared to take if  Germany proved recalcitrant.   an awkward situation will undoubtedly arise if and when Germany refuses to permit the visits  of inspection upon which  the Allies have again insisted in their latestnote.  France and  Belgium can, with  some force, argue that, by their  agreementwith the  terms  of  the  various notes  addressed  to  Germany, His  Majesty&apos;sGovernment stand committed to the logical  results of a German refusal to carryout. what  are undoubtedly her obligations  under the  treaty.  It is  not easy  tosuggest in advance what, the British attitude should be in such an eventuality.Perhaps it is enough to  express the hope that with a new French  Governmentjust in power there will be a reluctance across the Channel  to force an issue withHis Majesty&apos;s Government on the subject.  If Germany proves obdurate, strictlyspeaking,  she should be forced to yield.     21. The broad outline of British policy in this,  as in other kindred  questions,has  been  an effort  to induce  Germany to be reasonable and accept the Allieddemands,  and simultaneously to induce France to be patient and  to play fair so asto give Germany  a chance of playing fair too.  How far Germany would play fair if she was given the chance is a matter of some doubt.  There is plenty of evidence to show that she is making very little  effort to carry out her treaty obligations inrespect of  disarmament  at the present moment.   Meanwhile, the task of HisMajesty&apos;s  Government is by no means easy, attempting as  they  are  to inducereason into two&apos; unreasonable nations.   Their position  is. certainly  renderedno  less difficult by  the fact that both the Germans and French suspect them ofbeing unwilling to, do anything  concrete whether they (the  Germans and French jare reasonable or not.
