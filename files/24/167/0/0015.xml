           I desire to consult the Cabinet on the questionwhether the above-named Act, which ie expressed to expireon the 31st March, 1925, shall be included in this year&apos;sExpiring Laws Continuance Bill, with a view to its extensionfor a further year until the 31st Mar oh, 1926..           The effect of the Act is to augment the relief in respect of rates grained to occupiers of agricultural land by the Agricultural Rates Act, -1396, under whichthey had paid only one half cf the full burden of certainlocal rates.   By virtue of the Act of last year, the occupiers of agricultural land now pay only one quarterof the full rate in the   in the case of these rates anda grant is paid half yearly out of Government funds inrespect of the deficiency so caused.   Corresponding provision was made by the Act in the case of Scotland^          The duration of last year&apos;a Act was limited tothe period ending on the 31st March, 1935, ih order tomake it concurrent with the operation of the Act of 1898,                        vas extended by last year&apos;s Expiring Laws Continuance Bill.It was contemplated that by that date there would be onthe Statute Book a comprehensive measure of valuation and rating reform which would inter alia place the rating ofagricultural land on a permanent footing, and so do away with the need for the rating provisions of the Aots of1396 and 1923.           As the Cabinet are aware, a draft Valuation and RatingBill was circulated by  the.late Government in the autumn of 1923to the associations of local authorities and other bodies- interestedfor their consideration, and the Cabinet early in the presentyear approved the Bill  in principle.  It is, however, doubtfulJOGOMEHg IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;5 GOVERNMENT.                         CABINET.iET  ,   ,                                                Copy Hoif 13/24/         THE AGRICULTURAL RATES ACT, 1335.             Memorandum by the Minister of Health,
whether it will be possible to introduce such a measurethis Session owing to the tine necessarily Involved inthe consideration of the representations on the draftBill which have been received in the Ministry of health and to the amount of business already submitted or about to be submitted to parliaments   Even if it were possibleto pass a comprehensive measure of valuation and ratingreform during the present year, it is certain that it couldnot be brought fully into operation by March next year.          The Bill for the Act of 1S23 was opposed by theLabour Party during its passRge through the House ofCommons last year, mainly on the grounds (1) that itfailed to remove the unjust and heavy burden imposed uponagriculture and industry in general by the present systemof rating, (2) that it contained proposals which., althoughapparently designed for the relief of agriculture would,in fact, benefit the owner of^agricultural land as dis-tinct from the person engaged in agriculturef and (3) thatit failed to impose a condition that, in return for suchrelief, the agricultural worker should be assured of a living wage.   With regard to the first of these pointsit has already been suggested (above) that no comprehensivemeasure of rating reform can be made effective by march next;  with regaro? to the second, it is understood that  aseparate measure dealing with Land Values is contemplatedand with regard to the third it will be remembered that provision for the more adequate remuneration of theagricultural wage-earners is contained in the agricultural wages Bill of the present Session.          The Act of 1923 is now in operation, Is workingsmoothly and is undoubtedly regarded by the farmers as of real and immediate benefit to theme   Serious opposition may-be expected from them if the Act is allowed to lapse
in March, next.  - It is to be feared that the localrating authorities would now find it most difficultto collect rates from the occupiers of agricultural land on the scale in operation before the passingof the Act; and grave inconvenience would be caused to the local spending authorities if the ratingauthorities were unable to provide them promptlywith a sufficiency of rate moneys.          It seems to me that in the present circum-stances arrangements must be made for the continuanceof the Act of 1923 for another year.          It is also necessary to continue the Agri-cultural Rates Act,1896, which., originally enacted fora period of 5 years, has since been continued in opera-vtion by successive Expiring Laws Continuance Acts0The passing of the proposed Rating Bill would super-,sede both the 1396 Act and the 1923 Acta                      (IntldJ J.W.Ministry of Health,             y       May 22ndj,1924,
