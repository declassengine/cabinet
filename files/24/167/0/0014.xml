Q A  B I g E  T.                     MOHOPOLIES AND  COMBINATIONS.  -            Memorandum by the  President  of  the  Board  of Trade.              I  oirculate herewith to  my  colleagues for their         consideration draft heads of  a Bill prepared  in  the Board  of         Trade to meet a  possible demand  for general  legislation with         regard  to monopolies  and combinations.  These &quot;heads&quot;,  which         are  contained in Annex 1, are intended merely to show  the         general lines of the  proposed measure, and it haa been         thought premature to  submit  them either to the Law Officers         or to the Parliamentary draftsman until at least some         indioation  has been given by  the Govorament  that they         contemplate the  eventual  introduction  of a measure on  this         subject.               The  history of the recent  growth of monopolies  and         combinations in various forms and of  the attempts made in         different countries to  check by legislation the  abuses          arising from them has for  some  time past been the subjeot          of careful  s^tudy in the Board of Trade, and  a short         memorandum sketching  in  outline the reoent  history of the          problem is  appended (Annex 2).   It must bo owned that  the          positive results so far  achieved by these attempts,          especially  in Amerioa,  the  home of &quot;big business&quot;, have not          boen very encouraging.  Nevertheless the problem is of          considerable gravity and  one which arouses inoreasing  .          public  interest and concern, and it is not unlikely that a          demand might suddenly arise for legislation at short          notice, whioh might prove embarrassing to the Government-          unless they  had previously given careful consideration to
   the subject from the point of  view of  practicable  legislation.        In this&apos; connection I  may  point out that  the Parliamentary   discussions on Part II of  the  proposed Housing Bill are   almost certain to lead to a demand for  legislation  of more   general application, and it may even be found necessary in   the course of these discussions to give some  pledge with   regard to the eventual introduction of a general Bill   dealing with monopolies.        Generally speaking the &quot;heads&quot; of the Bill in Annex 1   explain themselvese  They give full powers to the Board of   Trade to investigate monopolies and combinations where there   is a prima facie oase for supposing that they are oausing   detriment to trade  or to the general public.   In the event   of the investigations disclosing  abuses which; in the opinion   of the Board of  Trade,&apos; could and  should be restrained by   law,  the Board are  empowered to draft  the necessary provisions   for the purpose, and  after due publication and enquiry   (following  generally  the  procedure for Special Orders laid   down  in the Factory Acts, Insurance Acts, etc.) they may   embodythe  provisions  in their final form in an Order to be   laid  before Parliament for confirmation in manner  provided.   Any  suoh Order will provide for  penalties for contravention   and  such remedies  as  injunction  and mandamus will  also  be .   available.  In  order to give  confidence as to the  im-   partiality of  the  public  enquiry  it is suggested  that  it   should be  held  by  members of  the  Railway and Oanal  Commission.         In circulating this  paper I  do not ask for authority to   introduce  a Bill immediately  on  these lines, but  only  for   suoh provisional endorsement  of  the general principle  as   will enable the Board of  Trade to proceed; with the   assistance of  Parliamentary Counsel,  to complete  and perfect    the draft  in consultation with the other Departments concerned   and with the  Law Officers,  and to submit the  resulting draft   Bill to the Home Affairs  Committee.

ANNEX I.Trade Monopolies...DRAFT OF HEADS OF A BILL for obtaining information with respect to trade monopolies and              -restraining abuses thereof.   1.  (l)   Where-;,, either on the representation  of personainterested, or otherwise, the Board of Trade are  of opinionthat there is reason to suppose that any  person or associationof persons is exercising a monopoly or substantial control over any trade, industry or business., or branch or part thereof,otherwise than in pursuance of any special Act or order havingthe force of an Act of Parliament, and that by reason  of  suchmonopoly or control or the methods by which it is exercisedserious prejudice is caused.or is likely  to be caused  to  anyperson, or to any trade, industry or business in  the unitedKingdom, the Board may hold an enquiry into the nature, extent and effect of such monopoly or control and the methods by which such monopoly or control is exercised, and the truth of the allegations made in any such representation.     Provided that before deciding to  hold any such enquiry theBoard may if they think fit enter into communication with theperson or association concerned and also  with any person  by whom a representation has been made and endeavour to promote an amicable arrangement between them.       (2) For the purpose of any such enquiry the Board  shallhave power to compel persons to appear before them and to requirethe production of such documents and the  furnishing of such information relating to the trade, industry or business which isthe subject matter of the enquiry as they may deem necessary and any person duly authorised in that behalf by  the Board ofTrade, may require the production to him  of any such books ordocuments, and may inspect and obtain a copy of the same, andmay make such enquiries relating to the trade, industry or business as the Board may deem necessary, and  if any personhaving the possession or control of any document  required to beproduced or in possession of any information or of the means ofobtaining any information required to be  given fails on application to prtsducevsuch document or to furnish such information or furnishes any information which he knows to be false in any material particular, he shall be liable on conviction by  a courtof summary jurisdiction to a fine not exceeding   fifty 7pounds,or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding ^one^/montn, or to both such Imprisonment and fine.    ? provide for a continuingpenaltyJ7.       (3) The Board of Trade may hold any enquiry which  they are authorised to hold under this Section by  any person or personsduly authorised In that behalf by an order of the Board.       (4) In addition to or in lieu of proceedings as aforesaidthe Board of Trade may apply to the Court to enforce theproduction of any document or the furnishing of any information required by them under the last preceding subsection and  theCourt may make an order accordingly.
      (5) Any document or information obtained under thisSection shall, unless the person producing or giving the sameotherwise agrees, be treated as confidential except for thepurpose of a Report to Parliament or of legal proceedings, and if.any person discloses or publishes any such document or information in contravention of this provision, he shall, on conviction by a Court of summary jurisdiction, be liableto a fine not exceeding fifty pounds, or to imprisonment fora term not exceeding one month, or to both such imprisonmentand fine.      (6) The Board shall lay before Parliament reports on anyenquiries under this section, provided that those reports shallnot contain any information as to trade secrets or name ofcustomers *   2*  Where as the result of such an enquiry as aforesaidthe Board of Trade are satisfied that any person or associationof persons exercise a monopoly or substantial control to which section 1 applies, they may if they think fit by order from timeto time require such person  or association to furnish them withsuch information relating to the trade, indtistry or business at such intervals and in such manner as the order may prescribewith a view to keeping the Board continuously informed as to thenature, extent and effect of such monopoly or control and themethods by which it is exercised.  The provisions of section 1Subsections (2) and (3) shall apply with regard to the supplyand use to be made of such information^  The Board of Trade shall present to Parliament such reports based on the information re-ceived, as they may think. fit*   3.  The power of the Board of Trade under Sections 1 and 2of this Act to require information to be furnished shall so faras the Board think necessary and relevant for  the purpose ofgiving effect to those sections extend to the furnishing ofinformation by persons or associations other than those who are alleged to exercise a monopoly or control.   4. (1) Where as the result of enquiries under this Act itappears to the Board of Trade that the power of monopoly or control of industry is being abused or is likely to be abusedthrough the adoption of any practices or methods which are con-trary to the public interest and ought to be prohibited, theBoard may draft an order prohibing  or restricting suchpractices or methods either generally and unconditionally or subject to such conditions, limitations and exceptions as may beprovided in the order.  Any such draft order shall be published and objections received and dealt with in accordance with theprocedure for special orders contained in the   Annex*.  Any publicenqu iry held in accordance with this procedure shall be held bythe persons who for the time being are members of the railway and Canal Commission who shall make a report to the Board of Trade,,.approving, disapproving or proposing amendments to the draft.* The provisions of the Annex would be based on the Schedule tothe Factory and Viorkshop Act;  the Unemployment Insurance Act,the Electricity Supply Act, etc, with the necessary modifications.
      (2) The Board of Trade after considering the results ofthe enquiry may lay the draft Order with any amendment thatthey may think necessary before Parliament, and any draft solaid shall not take effect if either House of Parliamentwithin (30) days during which it has been sitting after theOrder has been laid before it passes a resolution disapprovingof the order.Alternative., - shall not take effect until it has beenapproved&quot; by&quot;a resolution of both Houses of Parliament.      (3) Any such Order shall prescribe penalties for breach of its provisions and in addition thereto the court may on the application of the Board of Trade enforce theOrder by mandamus or injunction.  .   5,  In this Act the word &quot;Association&quot; does not include an association of workpeople which does not carry on any tradeindustry or business.
ANNEX  2.MONOPOLIES AND COMBINATIONS.     There are monopolies &quot;de jure&quot; and monopolies &quot;de facto&quot;.By the first term we mean the possessors of exclusive orpreferential privileges which exclude competitors or put them at a grave disadvantage;  by the second we mean undertakings or combinations which without possessing any special legalrights nevertheless exercise such a dominating influence over an industry or market as to produce economic effectsanalogous to those arising from &quot;de jure&quot; monopolies.  Promearly times both classes of monopolies were very repugnantto our ancestors.   Their objection was partly political,-partly economic.   On the political side they objectedstrongly to the arbitrary grant of privileges by the Crownin return for payments which resulted in a revenue uncon-trolled by Parliament.   On the economic side their objection to any cornering of the market or artificialenhancement of the price of necessaries was shown in thelong list of Statutes against &quot;forestalling&quot;, &quot;engrossing&quot;,&amp;c.     As regards our modern problem of the abuse of monopolypower we may practically leave out of account the questionof legal monopolies, since the only monopolies in thisstrict sense which now exist in the United Kingdom (e.g.patents), are so hedged round with safeguards in the publicinterest that no question of abuse at present arises,,  Evenin the case of local franchises for public utility services(electric light, gas, water, &amp;c.) in which frequently noactual legal monopoly is conferred it is usual to makecareful provision to ensure that the requirements of thepublic shall be adequately met on reasonable terms.   Statemonopolies (e.g. the tobacco Regie in Prance) have noexistence in Great Britain.     We may, therefore, confine our attention entirely to&quot;de facto&quot; monopolies, i.e., to monopolistic action arisingout of the dominating position actually occupied by anundertaking or bty a combination of undertakings apart fromany legal privilege.     The Economic changes of the Eighteenth Century andespecially the industrial revolution which made clear thatthe old methods of regulation and prohibition were unsuitedto modern conditions, and the simultaneous (and partlyconsequential)  change of attitude of philosophers andeconomists towards State control on the one hand and freedomof contract and &quot;natural liberty&quot; on the otherf resulted ina clean sweep of the laws against engrossing, forestallingand other forms of monopolistic action.   By the beginningof the Nineteenth Century there remained no relic of themediaeval restrictions except  the doctrine of the EnglishCommon Law that agreements in restraint of trade are voidand unenforceable at law.   The United States of America wasin exactly the same position, but the interpretation put upon the Common Law doctrine by the Courts of the twocountries tended to create a gradual divergence of practice.
0 4In the United Kingdom the disfavour with which the Courts regardedagreements in restraint of trade was tempered by the increasingsanctity attributed to the principle of free contract, and on thewhole the tendency has been to recognise the validity of agreements, even though some of their provisions are technicallyin restraint   of trade, if they appear reasonable in allthe circumstances of the case;  Speaking of voluntaryrestraints by agreement of the Parties Chief Justice Parkerstated  &quot;Where a contract for restraint of trade appears tobe made upon a good or adequate consideration so as to make it a proper and useful contract it is good&quot;,  (see P. 81 of McCurdyReport).  In the United States on the other hand the tendency was rather in the opposite direction, i.e. towards greater strictnessin the application of the doctrine of restraint of trade.  Thisdoctrine was repeatedly invoked with success to declare combinationagreements Invalid. It is therefore of great interest to study the experience of the United States in attempting to regulatecombinations by applying the ancient doctrine of restraint oftrade and, when this broke down, in supplementing the common law by positive legislation.     The first important American case &apos;of this kind  occurred in 1890 when a &quot;Trust&quot; established by the New River SugarRefining Company was declared illegal under the Common Law.By this time, however, it was realised in America that a meredeclaration of Invalidity wo uld  not be sufficient to preventagreements establishing combinations, and accordingly in 1890(the very year of the Sugar Refining-Company decision) theSherman Anti-Trust Act was passed which prohibited undersevere penalties &quot;every contract, combination in the form oftrust or otherwise, .  or conspiracy in restraint of trade orcommerce among the&apos; several states or with foreign nations,&quot;(Section l).     Section 2 imposed penalties on &quot;every person who shallmonopolise or attempt to monopolise or combine or conspirewith any other person or persons to monopolise any part of thetrade or commerce among the several States or with foreign nations&quot;.     In effect this Aot made punishable offences agreements which under the Common Law weri only invalid.     Meanwhile the combinations which were prevented by theSherman Act and the Sugar Refining Company decision fromestablishing trusts were looking about for alternative methods of achieving their objects, and in 1892 they succeeded in getting a law passed in New York State relaxing the existing prohibition on the holding by one Corporation of stock in another.  As JudgeWhitney remarked, this Law was &quot;put quietly through under thecover of the anti-trust agitation while the public, led by the newspapers v/ere looking somewhere else.&quot;     The next blow to the efficacy of the Sherman Act was theKnight case in 1895, when it was decided by the Supreme  Courtthat the Act did not prohibit combinations of manufacturers.This decision was followed by an immense development of manufacturers&apos; combinations culminating in the Consolidation  boomof 1898-1902,  I was in America in the Autumn of 1899 when theboom was at its height, and was causing a good deal of misgivingamong conservative business men, mainly lest it should be                           -2-  .
9 a)found that there was a shortage of supply of first classorganising and business talent capable of directing arightthe large number of consolidations which were coming into existence.  The first step taken to meet the situation created by the consolidation movement was the institution of Congress of the Industrial Commission which sat from1898-1902 and produced voluminous reports the chiefrecommendations being greater publicity regarding theoperations of Corporations and  the establishment of anorgan of publicity in the Federal Government.  The result was the constitution of the &quot;Bureau of Corporations&quot; in1903, to investigate the organisation and conduct ofCorporations and Combinations engaged in interstatecommerce (except Common Carriers) in order to give information to the President and to enable him to make recommendations to Congress.  The Commissioner ofCorporations had power to issue subpoenas and compel the attendance of witnesses and the production of papers.  Themethod pursued, however, was rather that of scientific research than the taking of formal evidence.  (eventually the Bureau was replaced by the Federal Trade Commissionconstituted by Act of Congress in 1914).     Meanwhile the Combinations continued the game of changingtheir forms as soon as any particular form of organisation was condemned under the Sherman Act.     Thus in the well known &quot;Northern Securities Case&quot; (1901-1904) the device of a holding company was declared unlawful.The American Tobacco Company, which hitherto had been a holding Company, immediately reorganised Itself as a merger,and the International Harvester Company (formed during theproceedings) was based on the principle of the merger.  It wasnot until 1911 that the device of the merger was definitelydeclared illegal by the Supreme Court, but before this date the decision of the Court as to holding Companies, and theIncreased public interest in combination agreements caused amarked tendency to drive these agreements underground and toreplace written understandings   by the no less powerful methodpf the unwritten &quot;gentlemen1s agreement&quot; for the interchangebf Information as to production, prices etc.                    v     The two decisions given by the Supreme Oonrt in1911 relating to the standard Oil and American Tobacco companies were both nominally victories for the Government, but the actualresults in checking the abuses of combination were practicallynil.  For example the Standard Oil Company (a holding Company!was directed to reorganise Itself in accordance with the Law and did so;  the holding company was dissolved and the stock of the subsidiary companies previously held by the holding company was distributed rateably among the persons who held the stock of thedissolved Company.  The result was that a few closely associated capitalists who formerly controlled the holding company now controlled the subsidiary companies directly,and the combination remained as effective as before*.* It is of some interest to note that in this case the   Government laid stress on Section 2 of the Sherman Act   prohibiting attempts to monopolise commerce,  rather than   Section 1 which was based on the Common Law doctrine of   restraint  of trade.
eg     Proceedings instituted in the same year  (1911) against theUnited States Steel Company under the Sherman Act failed, in1915, partly as I understand, on the ground that owing to thegrowth of outside concerns* during the period referred to, itspercentage control over the industry in the United States showednot an increase hut a decline.  It would seem from this  decision that the Supreme Court hold that a high   degree- of actual mono-polisation, and not only an organised attempt to monopolise, isrequired to bring a combination within the Sherman Act.     It w as by this time growing evident that efforts to suppresscombination by positive prohibitory legislation were no more likely to succeed than previous attempts to apply the Common Lawdoctrine of restraint of trade, and in 1914 a different line of approach to the problem was tried.  On the recommendation of president Wilson legislation was passed setting up a FederalTrade Commission with broad powers of investigation and recommen-dation.  The Act establishing the Commission contained aprovision declaring that &quot;unfair methods&apos; of competition incommerce are hereby declared unlawful&quot; and the Commission wascharged with interpreting this declaration.     In 1921 I discussed the working of the Federal TradeCommission at length with its Chairman,, Mr. Nelson Gaskill, andwas present at one of its sittings. I also discussed the matter with Mr. Herbert Hoover, Secretary for Commerce.  There is agood deal of difference of opinion as to the success or failureof the Commission, and the discussions made it clear that theestablishment of the Commission was the result of two quite different currents of economic opinion.  (As a matter of facttwo bills to give effect to President&quot;Wilson1s recommendations were introduced into Congress founded on two differentprinciples, and the law which eventually was passed represented a compromise).     (l) The object of one set of advocates of a Commission          was to strengthen the Sherman Act by providing a          permanent machinery of investigation which if a case          seemed to be established could move the Attorney          General to take legal action against offending          Corporations, and furnish evidence in support of          such action/     (2) The object of the second set of advocates was to          temper the unfairness and injury to commerce ?;hich          might result from too rigid an enforcement of the          Sherman Act by setting up an authority which could          in appropriate cases exercise a dispensing power,          i,e. protect a Corporation from legal proceedings          for an Act constituting a technical infringement of          the Sherman Act if satisfied on enquiry that the Act          in question was not contrary to the  public interest.;;&quot;Since that  date, however,  attempts by the  independent companies to  combine have been  retarded by a complaint of the Federal Trade  Commission under Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act;.  The case  Is still  pending.
0*7o t     As a matter of faot the second objeot has not been carriedout by the Federal Trade Commission, the provisions of theoriginal bill providing for&apos; it having disappeared during its passage through Congress.  Critics of the Commission neverthelessconsider that this is the most useful work that it could haveperformed, and that apart from this it has tended to beoomemerely a &quot;pin^pricking&quot; body, accomplishing little of value, and likely to get more and more into conflict with the Courts.  TheCommission, like all acts of the Democratic party, is not muchin favour with the present Republican Administration at Washington.For example, Mr. Hoover (as will be seen bolow) is so keenlyalive to the advantages of Trade Associations, that he is notvery sympathetic with anything which might oheck their development.     The Federal Trade Commission was set up by an Act ofSeptember, 1914, but before it oould get to work the so-calledClayton Anti-Trust Act of October, 1914, became law, whichthrewnew and important duties on the Commission.&apos;  The ClaytonAct prohibits by name certain practices &quot;in so far as they tendsubstantially to less competition&quot; (e.g. price discrimination,inter-locking dirsotorates, the holding of stock in otheroompanies, etc).  Thus it is partly directed against definiteabuses of monopoly (e.g. price discrimination), partly againstparticular forms of business organisation (e.g. inter-lockingof directorates and stock).     Tho present work of the Federal Trade Commission probablyarises not less from these provisions of the Clayton Act than from those of the law which called it into existence.  Inaddition an Act passed in 1918, which relaxes the Sherman ActIn its application to combinations and co-operative arrangementsfor export, has thrown certain important duties on the Commission.     It may be observed that the tendency of the CourtB to upset the findings of the Federal Trade Commission has becomeeven more pronounced since I was in America.,  In the Mellincase of alleged prioe discrimination (at the hearing of whichI was present) the Federal Trade Commission held that&apos;an offenoehad been committed, and issued an order to desist,  but theCircuit Court upset the Order.  The last published report ofthe Commission for the yoar 1922-33 shows twenty-three appeals from its deoisions since its establishment,  ten of which resulted in reversals.     Tho Report shows considerable activity on tho part of theCommission, not only as regards combinations and monopolies,but also as regards all forms of unfair trade practices even ifnot associated in any way with monopolies.  Thus the Commissionoovers a good deal of the ground of our own Merchandise MartoaAct, and also performs some kinds of useful  work not attemptedin Great Britain by any public authority, o.g,, tho standardisingof trade terms by conference with members of trades.     As regards monopolistic abuses the final stages of thogreat inquiry as to price discrimination by  the Steel companies will be watched with interest.     The above very brief skotch of American attempts to  control the abuses of monopolies indicates that little, positive successhas been attained by endeavours to oompol business.organisations to alter their form,  or to penalise particular methods  (e-.gt,voting trust,  holding company,  merger,  inter-lookingdirectorates,  etc.)  by which one business may obtain a controlover others.  Such efforts whenever successful have only  driven
the business organiaations to find some new method ofcombination not yet declared illegal, and it is noteworthythat the length of time necessary for the completion of thelegal proceedings up to the judgment of the Supreme Courthas usually enabled the able corporation lawyers to be readywith their alternative devioe even before the decision ofthe Court has made it necessary to have recourse to it.      Attempts under the federal Trade Commission Act and theClayton Act of 1914 to forbid by law, not only certain formsof business organisation but certain specific acts which aredeemed to be contrary to public polioy (e.g. prioediscrimination) are now being watched with interest, but sofar the inherent difficulty of preventing abuse by legal meanswithout at the same time impairing the elasticity and freedomof ordinary commercial methods does not appear to have beenaltogether overcome, and the result is that the activitiesof the Federal Trade Commission are unpopular not only amongthe offenders against whom it takes action, but among thegeneral business community who dislike and fear interference     A very interesting light is shed on the problem of trade association and combination from a different point of view in a recent Report by Mr, Hoover&apos;s Department of Commerce on &quot;trade association Activities  (1923).  This Report approaches thesubject from the point of view not of penalising improperaction but of encouraging beneficient activities.  It forms part of a comprehensive survey undertaken by the Departmentj.nto various methods of promoting economic efficiency, including.the elimination of  waste, the diminution of fluctuations, andthe standardisation and improvement of methods.  In the courseof this inquiry LIr. Hoover was naturally led to invoke the help of trade associations, when he, discovered that some ofthe Associations were deterred from adopting certain practices which appeared wholly  &apos;beneficial by the doubt whether theywould not be exposed to proceedings under the Anti-Trust Laws.Accordingly onFebruary 3rd 1922,h&apos;r. Hoover addressed a longletter to the Attorney General asking for an informal opinionon the legality&apos;of a series of practices, including suchmatters as uniform costing, standards, trade labels, statistics,etc., etc.  The Attorney General&apos;s reply was cautious, but onthe whole and with certain exceptions pronounced in favour ofthe legality of the practices desoribed.  Here we have a development not it is true in contradiction to the procedure of the Federal Trade Commission, but on wholly different lines,Although stress is laid on the informality of the wholecorrespondence its result, and doubtless its intended result,must be to encourage trade associations to engage in a numberof operations from whioh they have previously been deterred byfear of legal proceedings.     On the whole it would appear that the most useful field ofaction in the United States hac been in the matter of inquiry and publicity.   I have already mentioned the Industrial*We oan hardly wonder if the business world is upset by some  of  the operations of the Federal Trade Commission, when we read  the report of the Trenton Potteries Case (1923), where a  number of persons were proseouted, oonvicted and sentenced  to  imprisonment or fined or both for belonging to a price-fixing  Association, although no attempt was made to prove that any  of the prioes fixed were unreasonable.  The oase is under  appeal.
Commission (1898-1902) and. the Bureau of Corporations whichsucceeded it in 1903,  The Bureau was eventually absorbed intothe Department of Commerce and Industry, anc1 the task of inquiry into combinations  became part of the normal duty ofthat Department.  The Act of 1914 constituting the FederalTrade Commission transferred to it the powers of the Departmentof Commerce and Industry for the investigation of  combinations.It is not unlikely that at some future date these powers willbe re-transferred to the Department, and certainly some over-lapping of functions would be presented by such transfer.     At all events in drav/ing any lessons from United Statesexperience for our own use the relative advantage of having aspecial investigating Commission, or of attaching the duty of investigation to a permanent Department must remain an openquestion.  Both plans have been tried in  America, and there isno consensus of opinion as to their comparative merits.  Thequestion is one of detail and not of principle.     It will be observed from what has been already said thatthere is one outstanding feature of the American position whichhas at present no analogy in Great Britain, viz,, theexistence side by side with the Commission of Inquiry, of lawsdirectly penalising monopolistic combinations and  certain oftheir practices.  Hence in America the Commission has only tocome to a conclusion on the facts and make an order  and thelegal means of enforcement are already provided.  In GreatBritain, however, there are no laws of this kind, andconsequently if it be desired to establish some authority with power to investigate combinations and monopolistic practiceswe shall have to choose between two alternatives  (a) to providemerely for inquiry and publication, trusting to the effect of publicity alone, or  (b) to enact positive legislation providing a remedy in proved cases of abuse of the monopoly power.     The legislation referred to under  (b) might proceed (likethe Sherman Act) by making certain forms of organisation ormonopolistic Acts illegal, or alternatively by penalisingspecific abuses found to exist as the result of inquiry.      The experience of other countries and British Dominions^in this matter does not seem to throw much light on the problem as it presents itself in Great Britain,  Up to quite recenttimes the growth and danger of combinations, and othermonopolistic reorganisations in Great Britain attained much smaller dimensions and attracted much less attention thaneither in the United States (which is the &quot;locus Classious&quot;for experiments in remedial measures) or in Germany where&quot;&quot;-Reference should however be made to a recent Canadian Act passed   in June, 1923, entitled &quot;Investigation of Combines, Monopolies   Trusts and Mergers Act&quot;,  which contains not only detailed   provisions for investigation but also a provision (which at first   sight seems outside the title  of the Act) making it a criminal   offence to take part in a &quot;Combine&quot; detrimental to the public.   There is as yet no experience of the working: of this Actc   Inquiries in Canada shew that no case has yet arisen under it.
before the war &quot;Cartels&quot; (the typical form of German combination)were encouraged as instruments of an aggressive export policy&quot;.*     It is therefore unnecessary to look earlier than the war period for British proposals for remedying the abuses of monopoly, though of course the subject was treated at a much earlier date by unofficial economic writers.     War experience, however, revealed clearly the tendency towards large scale business and closer trade organisation which the growing intensity of foreign competition seemed likely to stimulate.   Lord Balfour of Burleigh&apos;s Committee on commercial and Industrial Policy after the ,iar, reporting inDecember, 1917, recommended that combinations especially for.promoting export should be encouraged, but that a responsibleDepartment should have access to adequate information as to theformation of combinations and provision should be madefor investigation in certain cases.   Combination agreementsregistered with the Board of Trade should be enforceable atlaw as between the parties.     Soon after the publication of this report a new Committeewas appointed by the Ministry of Reconstruction under mr. McCurdy&apos;s chairmanship, with the following reference:-          &quot;In view of the probable extension of trade organisa-     tions and combinations, to consider and report what action     if any, may be necessary to safeguard the public interest&quot;.This Committee reported in favour of establishing machinery forthe Investigation of the operation of monopolies, trusts andcombines, and added their belief that ultimately it would befound necessary to establish further machinery to remedy theabuses discovered by the tribunal of Investigation.   The Boardof trade were to make all preliminary inquiries and ifsatisfied that there was a prima facie case that the publicInterest was being detrimentally affected they were to beempowered to refer the matter to a tribunal of investigationconsisting of a permanent legal chairman with other qualifiedpersons selected from a panel.     Shortly after the close of the war the Profiteering Act1919, imposed certain duties on the Board of Trade with regardto the investigation of trusts and combinations of a similarnature (Section 3).   The Act expired in 1921.   The general effect of the investigations made was, on the whole, ratherreassuring than alarming.*A new German law dealing with Cartels has just been enacted  (Nov.19g3) which enables a Tribunal (The Trust Court) on   complaint by the Home Secretary to invalidate any Cartel Agree-   ment which is contrary to the public interest or to prohibit any   method of enforcing it.   There is also power to permit any   member to free himself from the obligation of the Agreement.  The   Act covers agreements to fix prices, delimit markets or restrict  /production, but apparently doss not apply to export organisations,-   There is no experience of its working,    (Quite recently   (September 1923) the Argentine Republic has enacted an Anti-Trust   Law (for text see Board of Trade Journal of November 15th,  1923,   p. 530).   It gives us no helpful suggestions).
     In the last two or three years the severity of thetrade depression has diverted attention from the questionof monopolies which always gain in power and hence in danger tothe public interest in times of booming trade and rising prices.Thus the present period may be the most appropriate time toconsider the form of measures that may be urgently called for as Trade revives.     It is submitted that experience supports the view thatthe real choice lies between     (a)  a measure of inquiry and publicity only,     (b)  a measure of inquiry and publicity, coupled with            provisions aiming at providing a remedy for abuses            disclosed by Inquiry.
