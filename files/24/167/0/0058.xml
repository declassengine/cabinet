With reference to the Memorandum circulated hy theFirst lord of the Admiralty CP.344(24), I venture tooffer some observations which may serve to remove hisLordship&apos;s apprehension that. a divergence of legalopinion exists upon this important topic.     It will be recalled that at the meeting of theCabinet on 6th June the question raised was whethera Royal Proclamation was an essential pre-requisiteof the employment of naval ratings to render servicesof a civil character in aid of the Executive.  I expressedthe.view, to which I adhere, that a Proclamation is not an essential pre-requisite.  The right of the executive to invoke the aid of the armed forces of the Crown withoutthe preliminary of issuing a Proclamation is, I think,undoubted, provided always that the circumstances justifyresort to such a measure.     I agree with the view expressed in the Opinionsannexed to the JTirst lord&apos;s Memorandum that the onlyjustification .for resort to the use of naval ratings,where no naval object is in view, is that in the opinionof His Majesty&quot;s Ministers a state of circumstancesexists in which the safety of the Realm is endangeredand that the execution of certain civil services hy naval ratings  is an essential step for the preservation of theState.  The responsibility of deciding that such a stateof circumstances exists and that such services are
essential rests with the Executive.  This question isnot primarily a legal one.     Once, however, the Executive has reached theconclusion that the safety of the Itealm is in dangerI think that they may call for the assistance of anyof the armed forces.of the Crown in any measures necessary to avert the danger, and may do so without first issuing a Proclamation.  There may obviously be wide divergence of view as to what constitutes a danger to the realm.  There is no absolute criterion.But a considered decision of the Executive that suchdanger existed and that certain steps were necessaryto avert it would be very difficult to controvertc     The particular question whether the recentthreatened shutting down of the London Electric power stations would have involved a menace to public security is a question of opinion, discretionaryrather than legal in character.  Priraa facie I shouldhave thought not, unless the Executive had information that serious civil disturbances might be expected toensue.  But assuming the Executive to have decidedthat public security would be endangered by theshutting down of the Power Stations, I think thatthey could have invoked the aid of naval ratings tokeep them going, without first issuing a proclamation,,     While, then, I am of opinion that naval ratingsmay be invoked in aid of the civil power without thepre-requisitQ of a Proclamation, I equally recognisethat only circumstances which, in the view of theExecutive, involve a danger to the iJealm would justifyresort to this step, and I further recognise the propriety of prefacing such action by the issue o a Proclamation where possible.                            o
           The Emergency Powers Act 19 0 does not derogate      from the prerogative  powers of the Crown in the      matter.  But  it. affords  in certain instances the      means of avoiding the difficult question whether a      danger to  the Realm has  actually arisen or is      threatened.   It enables  the Executive after issuing      a Proclamation of Emergency,and in conformity with      regulations to he made hy Order in Council, to take      steps (which  include  the use of the forces of the      Crown) to  secure the  supply of the vital essentials      of communal life, without deciding that the security      of the Bealm  is actually threatenedc  She Act therefore      provides the  safest machinery for dealing with such      eventualities and will naturally be generally utilised      for the purpose,                                    (Intdo)  H.E.M.16th June.^1924,     Sir John Anderson has seen the  foregoingMemorandum and desires to associate  himself with  theviews expressed in it,                                (mtd.)
