TITLE      It  is  proposed  to.alter the  title with  a  view to preventing  amendments.on extraneous  subjects.   The amended title would be  as  follows :.-          &quot;A Bill to  amend  the provisions  of  the          Housing, &amp;o&apos;.  Act,  1923, relating to          Government contributions,  and for  other          purposed connected therewith.&quot;                   m                     Clause 1.      Under  the  olause as it stands a house in an agricultural parish at the time when lt is built  is entitled to a contri-bution of  12,10s.. per  annum;  but if the parish afterwardsceases to be an agricultural parish, as defined in subs. (3)of the clause,  future contributions will be reduced to  9.The character of the parish might alter in the course of 40years owing to a number of circumstances;  for instance,  the starting of a large  industry.  It is submitted, however, that what&apos;  is to be regarded  is,the character of the parish at thetime  when it is deemed necessary, that new housoa should  be built, and the persons who undertake the building at that time are entitled to look for a fixed contribution irrespective  of subsequent changes in the character of the parish.   Th&apos;e  amend-ment  necessary for this pxirpose would be as follows:-      Page 2, lines 11 and 12, leave out &quot;and  so long ap&apos;&apos; andinsert &quot;at the time when the construction  of  the house  ifrcommenced&quot;.
     Para, (a) of subs,  (l) deals with the special conditons that are to be complied with in connectionwith the rates of wages, etc.,  to be paid in theconstruction of the houses, and the rents that are tobe charged on the lettings of the houses.  It isproposed to deal with these two matters in two separateparagraphs to take the place of para.  (d).          The following  paragraphs are suggested:-     &quot;(d)  that fair wages clauses,,  in accordance with a          form to be prescribed by the Minister,  shall          be  inserted in all contracts for  the con-          structidn of the houses;  and      (e)  that the rents charged  in respect  of the          houses  shall not in the aggregate  exceed the          a mount&quot;1 that would be  payable if each house        -  were let at tho average rent charged  in  the          area of the local authority  at  the  time  of  the          passing of this  Act in  respect  of working-class          houses  erected prior  to the  3rd day of August,          1924,  except where the  expenses incurred in          connection with  the provision of  the  houses          exceed,  so far as the same are borne  by  the          local  rate,  an amount equivalent to  four          pounds  ten shillings  a  year  in respect of          each house.&apos;.&apos;
      Under  this clause the Minister  is empowered to stop contri-  butions  in  respect  of houses completed after the date mentioned  in the order,  An order of this kind should apply throughout  Great Britain.  The number of  houses guaranteed by tbo industry  has been fixed for Great Britain, and therefore failure to produce  the stipulated number should entail a stoppage throughout Great  Britain,   In these circumstances it might be desirable that the  powers given by this clause should be given both to the Minister  and to the Scottish Board of Health,  to be exercised  jointly by  them.   This would  necessitate some drafting amendments.      It is proposed that  an order made under this  clause  should  terminate the contributions finally and that it should not  be  possible  to revive contributions by a subsequent order, as  proposed in the  original draft.  It  is also proposed  that any orders  under this Clause terminating the contributions  or under  Clatise 4 revising  the contributions  should  be  laid  in draft  before the House  of  Commons and  should  not have  effect  until the  draft  has&quot;been approved by a  resolution  of the House  of Commons.  This proposal  would  be  effected by the  following  Clause which might take the  place  of  Clause  5.           &quot;5.   Before any order is made by the  Minister under           this  Act a  draft  of the  proposed order should be laid           before the  Commons  House  of Parliament and the Order.:           shall not  be made unless and until a  resolution is          passed by that House&apos;approving of the  draft either           without  modification  or  subject  to such modifications           as may be  specified in the  resolution  and upon such           approval being given  the order can be  made in the           form  in  which the.draft has been approved.&quot;
           It would appear to be necessary that the power of      revising oontrihutions should he exercisable by the      Minister and the Soottish Board of Health jointly for      similar reasons to those stated in the note on Clause 3o           In lines 7 and 8,  it is proposed to omit the words      &quot;and  with the consent of the treasury&apos;., which are superfluous      in this place.           In order to emphasise the fact that any revision will     be based upon an estimate of the probable cost of building     within the next three years as a result of the experience     of the actual cost within the preceding three years,  it     is proposed that the opening words of the clause should  be     amended as follows:   viz:   page 5,  line 6,  at end insert:-                      eg          &quot;shall take into consideration the expenses which           are likely to be  incurred  in the  next  succeeding           three years in or  in connection with the provision           of houses in respect  of which  contributions  will           be payable,  due regard being  had  to the  expenses           actually incurred  during the  last three  years for           similar purposes&quot;.           The insertion of  these words  will  enable  subs.  (2)     of the Clause to be omitted.                          Clause  5.                    See  Hot a  to  Clause  3,Ministry of Health,     Whitehall,         3rd May,  1924.
