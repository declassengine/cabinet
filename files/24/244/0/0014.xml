this document is the property of his britannic majesty&apos;8 governmentPrinted for the Committee of Imperial Defence.   October 1933.SECRET. Copy No.    47O.O.S. 310.(Also C.I.D. Paper No. 1113-B.)COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee.IMPERIAL DEFENCE POLICY. (Previous Paper No. CCS. 307.)Annual Review (1933).I. Introduction.IN the year 1931 we did not present our usual Annual Review of Imperial Defence Policy because, in the early part of that year, the whole ground had been covered comprehensively in other Reports, and the Committee of Imperial Defence (253rd Meeting) accepted our view that the moment was inopportune for a fresh Annual Review which must cover the same ground.2. In 1932 we received instructions from the Cabinet to submit to the Committee of Imperial Defence our remarks on the assumption on which the annual Estimates of the Defence Services were based, viz., that at any given date there will be no major war for ten years, and, in consequence, we devoted our Annual Review exclusively to that subject (OLD. Paper No. 1082-B).&apos;3. As this is our first Annual Review since the cancellation by the Cabinet of the above assumption, and as nearly three years have elapsed since our last comprehensive Review (C.I.D. Paper No. 1009-B, of July 1930), we have dealt with the subject on the present occasion on broad lines.4. To assist us papers have as usual been prepared by the Foreign Office,. Colonial Office, India Office, and Home Office. In addition, a summary of the work of the Committee of Imperial Defence since the 1930 Review has been prepared by the Secretary, and the Joint Oversea and Home Defence Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence have provided us with their Annual Review on the Defence of Ports at Home and Abroad. These documents have been circulated separately as OLD. Paper No. 1112-B.5. As a preface to the more detailed discussions of Imperial Defence matters to which succeeding sections of this Report are devoted, we comment briefly below on the world situation in the light of the information contained in the memorandum by the Foreign Office on the Foreign Policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom (C.I.D. Paper No. 1112-B, Annexure I,-Section 1).6. In paragraph 2 of the Foreign Office Memorandum, the opinion is expressed that &apos;&apos; the economic and political situation of the world has for a variety of causes seriously deteriorated, and that the course of events has not only brought to general notice the unsound basis on which international relations rest, but also confronted the world with the unescapable dilemma of finding an urgent solution for the most serious of these questions or of witnessing the further and perhaps rapid deterioration of the situation.&quot;
7. It was a realisation of tlie general instability of world conditions, particularly those in the Far East, which led us to recommend that the time had come when what was known as the &quot; ten-year &quot; rule basis for Service Estimates should be cancelled. It was on similar grounds that we felt impelled to draw the attention of the Cabinet to the very precarious position in which we were situated in the Far East by reason of the almost complete absence of defences at the Singapore Base. The position was fully covered in the paper which we submitted recommending that the defence programme for Singapore should be accelerated (C.I.D. Paper No. 1103-B), and we need not reiterate our arguments in the present review. It is sufficient to recall that the Committee of Imperial Defence recommended, and the Cabinet accepted, the proposal that the completion of the first stage of the defence programme at Singapore should be expedited by a matter of eighteen months.   That work is in hand.8.   In our 1930 review (C.I.D. Paper No. 1009-B) we stated that-&quot; The more important changes in the world situation of the past few years, and especially those which have occurred during the past twelve months, have tended more and more to shift at present the centre of gravity of the defence problems of this country towards the East.&quot;Although for the moment tension in the Far East may be said to have relaxed since the signing of the truce between China and Japan, and the demonstration by Japan of her power to maintain the situation she has created, we cannot visualise the stabilization of the situation in the Far East for many years to come. The failure of the League of Nations to effect a settlement of the Sino-Japanese dispute, the creation of the independent State of Manchukuo (which China has, so far, refused to recognise), the negotiations for the sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway, the notice of withdrawal from the League given by Japan and the uncertainties of the internal condition of China itself may each or all give rise again in the future to those types of situation which have caused us anxiety in the past.9. The Far East therefore remains a potential danger zone, and its importance from the point of view of Imperial Defence has in no way diminished. But, during the last year, as indicated in the Foreign Office Memorandum, a second danger zone has appeared in Europe itself. It is, therefore, no longer possible to allow the Far East entirely to absorb our attention as might perhaps be inferred from our review of 1930.10. This development is described in paragraph 3 of the Foreign Office Memorandum, where it is shown that a general deterioration has occurred, one of the worst symptoms of which is &apos;&apos; the increasing discredit into which the League of Nations has fallen during the past two years.&quot; In 1930, when our last comprehensive review was submitted, the prestige of the League was believed to be higher than at any time since its founda-tion. At the present moment that prestige has sunk to a low ebb. This is further emphasized in the succeeding paragraph of the Foreign Office Memorandum, where it is stated that &quot; the world seems indeed to have gone steadily downhill. The most flagrant case is that of Germany, which is once more manifestly becoming a public menace; the spirit of that country is worse than at any time before 1914.&quot; In a later passage (paragraph 9) the Memorandum describes the rapid growth of militarism in Germany and the loss of confidence which this increasingly aggressive spirit has inspired. Events that have occurred since the Foreign Office Memorandum was written tend to confirm the impression of increasing unrest in Europe.11. After studying carefully the Foreign Office Memorandum, and other information at our disposal, we reach the conclusion that we are now faced with a further major problem in Europe. This problem relates particularly to Germany, and we should like to put on record our opinion that Germany is not only already starting to rearm, but that she will continue this process until within a few years hence she will again have to be reckoned as a formidable military power. Whatever may be the outcome of the Disarmament Conference or of any other negotiations, so far as we can see at present, the trend of German policy is to continue to rearm either openly or covertly.
12. The two problems of Europe and the Pacific, however, are different in kind. The problem of Europe may resolve itself into the fulfilment of obligations into which we have entered at various times with the object not only of main-taining the peace of Europe, but of ensuring, as is vital to our security, that the Low Countries are not again overrun by a great continental Power. The problem of the Far East is the defence of our interests and possessions.13. At the request of the Cabinet in connection with the proposed renewal of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty negotiations, we submitted a Report (C.I.D Paper No. 1114-B, Enclosure 3) outlining the military position in Egypt and the safeguards which we considered were essential from the point of view of Imperial defence. Our suggestions aimed, firstly, at the general &quot;safeguarding of that vital link Of the Empire, the Suez Canal, and, secondly, at the security from invasion of Egypt itself and the protection of British interests in Egypt in time of internal disorder.,14. We have also had under preliminary review the question of the security, generally, of our bases and communications in the Mediterranean. At the present time, in view of our good relations with France and Italy, and the greater urgency of our defensive requirements elsewhere, this aspect of Imperial Defence cannot occupy a high order of priority. But we feel bound to mention that our defensive arrangements in the Mediterranean are in many respects obsolete and have not been adjusted to the development of the French and Italian navies, and the increasing range and strength of French and Italian military aircraft.15. Finally, before leaving these introductory remarks, we desire to make some reference to the Disarmament Conference. This Conference has now been in session since February 1932; the possibility of a satisfactory result still appears doubtful. The fundamental differences of policy, always latent, but recently thrown into relief, which separate France and Germany remain as difficult of solution as ever. We have had continuously under review the problems which have been thrown up by the discussions at Geneva and since papers have been prepared on all the more important subjects, we do not think any useful purpose would be served by including further reference in this Review. We would observe, however, that in the event of a failure of the Disarmament Conference, the whole position in respect of our Imperial defence forces will require reconsideration.II. Commitments.16. The scheme of this report is to review our defence resources in the light of established principles of Imperial Defence and of the international obligations which His Majesty&apos;s Government have assumed. We also indicate the extent to which these resources fall short of our responsibilities, and the direction in which, on a reasonable interpretation of the international situation, our present effort should be concentrated.17. The leading commitments arising out of British foreign policy are given in their order of importance in Section 10 of the Foreign Office Memorandum (C.I.D. PaperNo. 1112-B, Annexure I, Section I), and so far as Imperial defence is concerned, with one exception, they do not appear to alter the situation as laid down in previous years and dealt with in earlier reviews. The one exception concerns Iraq : on the admission of Iraq to the League of Nations in October 1932, our mandatory obligations ceased and were replaced by the Anglo-Iraq Treaty of Friendship.18. Before setting out in detail the position of each Service, it may be convenient to summarise the main principles governing the problem of Imperial Defence which were set out in our First Annual Review, with such modifications as the altered status of Iraq may require.19. The maintenance of sea communications is the first principle of the system of Imperial Defence, and the major share of this responsibility still rests with His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom. Apart from this, the chief principle is that, on the one hand, each of the several Dominions is responsible for its internal security and for protecting its territory and coastal trade against aggression until support arrives from outside; while, on the other
hand, His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom, in addition to its duty to defend its own territory, is mainly responsible for the security of the communications between the several parts of the Commonwealth, the provision of adequate defences in the non-self-governing colonies and protectorates, and the mandatory territories assigned to the United Kingdom which are not in a position to defend themselves; the protection of our interests in foreign countries generally, and of our special position in Egypt and Iraq.20. In accordance with these principles, the responsibilities devolving chiefly on the armed forces maintained by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom are : (i) The&apos; mainteila,2Ge of &quot;our sea communications; this responsibility is mainly naval, supplemented by air forces in narrow seas. The security of the naval bases, fuelling stations and other important points on the sea routes, on which the whole structure of the defence of our sea communications depends, together with the defence of the Colonies and Protectorates until relief arrives, . is principally the responsibility of the Army supplemented by air forces.(ii) The defence of India, and in certain circumstances Afghanistan, against external aggression. This is principally an Army responsibility, of which the Air Force will bear their appropriate share.(iii) The fulfilment, so far as our resources and the situation allow, of our treaty commitments under the Locarno Treaty.(iv) The control of the mandated territories of Palestine and Trans-Jordan, (v) The defence against external aggression of Iraq in accordance with theterms of the Anglo-Iraq Treaty of 1932. (vi) The provision of air defences in Great Britain, from which source, also, is to be found the air striking force for any major war abroad.   This is an Air Force responsibility, but the Army assists by providing anti-aircraft defences.(vii) The provision and development of Imperial air communications and airports.(viii) The maintenance of an Army and Royal Air Force Expeditionary Forcein the East or in Europe to provide for commitments (i) to (v).21. These, briefly, are the responsibilities resulting from our national commitments, and since our first review in 1926 several new factors have been added: (i) The Soviet menace in Afghanistan; *(ii) Internal instability in China, with which may be included the formationof the new State of Manchukuo;(iii) The notice of withdrawal from the League of Nations given by Japan;(iv) The militarist revival in Germany.After having considered carefully the list of commitments, we have come to the conclusion that there are three of major importance, namely : (i) The defence of our possessions and interests in the Far East; (ii) European commitments; and (iii) The defence of India against Soviet aggression.If and when we are in a position to meet these three major commitments, no difficulties should arise with the remainder. In the next section of this report, therefore, we set out in relation to each Service separately the present position, the responsibilities which these commitments might entail and the means at our disposal if we were called upon to implement them.22. In framing our review on these lines, we have in mind our duty to place before His Majesty&apos;s Government the situation of the three Defence Services vis-a-vis the important commitments into which His Majesty&apos;s Government have entered from time to time, or which fall on His Ma;jesty&apos;s Government by reason of the far-flung responsibilities of Empire. We do so in no alarmist spirit. We are aware that steps have already been authorised whereby our defensive position in the Far East will tend progressively to improve during the next three years, but we feel that with the general instability of world
conditions, we should be failing in our duty if we did not point out that, in say three to five years&apos; time, when the anticipated military revival in Germany may have been realised, we shall be in a worse position than to-day to implement the Treaty of Locarno, unless the unsatisfactory and inadequate means at our disposal are increased and the general position is rectified.III. The Position of the Three Defence Services in relation to theirCommitments.23. In paragraph 21 we summarised what we considered were the three major commitments which might have to be faced by the three Defence Services. We propose to consider each of these commitments separately, and to review, in relation to each, the particular position of each Service. We make this somewhat arbitrary division because we think it will enable us more clearly to set out the position; but we would emphasise that it is not possible, in practice, to consider separately one commitment without another. Even though we might be engaged in operations in the Far East, it would obviously be impossible to consider the position in that area without, at the. same time, taking into account the position nearer home.24. So long as the European situation was determined by the results of the Treaty of Versailles, this factor did not seem to be of undue importance, since the possibility of facing a war with France was practically discounted, and the immense French superiority on land and in the air made any other chance of war in Europe remote. By the signing of the Treaty of Locarno, however, we undertook definite commitments, and to that extent made our participation in a European war more likely without in any way reducing our responsibilities in the Far East. So long as the superiority of France over Germany is maintained the situation need not, perhaps, cause undue anxiety; but we are now faced with the position that the rearmament of Germany^is imminent, if it has not actually begun; a factor which may increasingly tend to disturb the existing balance in Europe.25. Under a Locarno war the two problems with which we might be faced are war with France against Germany, or, theoretically at any rate, war with Germany against France. We should like at once to emphasise, however, what will be increasingly evident from the succeeding sections of this Review, that our position in a war with Germany against France would be virtually impossible. We have no Expeditionary Force comparable to that of 1914, and our Air Force, in numerical comparison with the French, is greatly inferior. Fortunately we cannot conceive a situation in which France would willingly range herself against us. In fact, responsible French military opinion has made very categorical statements to this effect. From the point of view of Imperial Defence, therefore, we venture to concur in the view expressed in the Foreign Office Memorandum (C.I.D. Paper No. 1112-B, Annexure I, Section 1, paragraph 9) that &quot;With France it is essential that our relations should be close and friendly.&quot;26. From the above it will be seen that we have not regarded the likelihood of war with France seriously, and in the section of this Report dealing with European Commitments it will be found that we have concentrated on one side only of the Locarno picture, namely, the contingency of a war in which we are fighting with France against Germany. We have dealt more briefly with the other possibility in an Appendix (see below, paragraph 66).27. In this connection we would draw attention to the fact that it has been accepted for the past ten years that we must be prepared, at any time, to send a British Fleet to the Far East, keeping in Home Waters only a relatively small force of a few capital ships, cruisers, destroyers and submarines. At the time of the Washington Treaty we had a sufficient margin over the fleet of Japan to maintain, if necessary, equality with France in European waters in all types of vessels excepting submarines, while sending a fleet to the Far East slightly superior to that of Japan.28. France, ever since, has continued a steady programme of increased building, which has inspired a similar though smaller programme on the part of Italy.   Our position has also been weakened by the London Naval Treaty
and thus gradually, during the last ten years, our power to retain, in European waters, a margin of ships sufficient for all circumstances when a Fleet superior to the Japanese has been sent to the East, has been prejudiced. Moreover, other nations have not followed our suggestion for a reduction in the size of cruisers, and have recently announced programmes of large and powerful ships. This action will increase still more the difficulty and cost of meeting our commitments.29. From the naval point of view this situation gives rise to two effects. We are forced, firstly, to consider seriously the possibility that a Locarno war may actually occur; and, secondly, we have to take into consideration the possibility of an increasing German Navy, in calculating the margin of naval power that we must leave in Europe if we should have to despatch a Fleet to the Far East.(i) The Defence of our Possessions in the Far East.(a) General.30. The defence of our possessions in the Far East is dependent primarily on the provision of adequately protected naval bases and, in particular, of a base at Singapore from which our main Fleet could operate with security in time of need.31. In our Annual Review of 1932 we drew particular attention to the serious state of affairs arising out of the defenceless state of our naval bases in the Far East, and recommended &quot; (b) That a start should be made in providing for commitments which are purely defensive, including the defence of bases. First, priority should be given to requirements in the Far East on which we are submitting a separate report.(c) That a decision should not be delayed until the results of the Disarmament Conference are known. Recent events in the Far East are ominous.  We cannot ignore the &apos; writing on the wall.&apos; &quot;32. Subsequent events have more than justified this warning. It is no exaggeration to say that the absence of defences at Singapore has made it difficult to defend our interests or to pursue a decided policy in the Far East in the interests of world peace and in support of international obligations and agreements.33. As stated in paragraph 7, His Majesty&apos;s Government has now decided to complete the first Stage of the permanent defences of Singapore with the least possible delay, and, in the meantime, we are examining the emergency measures which might be taken to render the situation less dangerous until such time as the permanent defences can be installed.34. In the Foreign Office Review of 1933 (C.I.D. Paper No. 1112-B, Annexure I, Section 1) it is stated that &quot; the development of the Singapore base and the question of Japanese immigration are not at present active issues.&quot; Though this may be true from a purely diplomatic point of view, it is in no way true and, we understand, is not intended to apply as regards Imperial Defence. It cannot be reiterated too often that the basis on which is founded the whole structure of Imperial Defence is the maintenance of our sea communications, and that, until adequate defences are provided for the bases which are vital to the Fleet, those bases are hostages to the enemy and our sea communications will remain in grave jeopardy. The provision of modernised coast defences on a continuous programme must, therefore, continue to be a most urgent problem in Imperial Defence.(b) Naval Responsibilities.35. From a naval point of view, the defence of our possessions and interests in the Far East remains the greatest and most immediate of our commitments. The naval responsibilities may be summarised as involving, firstly, the provision and operation of a main fleet in the Far East sufficient to meet the Japanese Fleet at her selected moment; and, secondly, behind the cover of this main fleet, the
are allowed by this treaty, viz. : Capital ships     ... ... ... ... 9Aircraft carriers ... ... ... ... 4Cruisers             ... ... ... ... 2937. To be prepared to meet the Japanese Fleet at her selected moment it is necessary to have a margin to allow for the docking and refit of our ships, as well as the additional ships for the defence of our sea communications. The British forces required in the East for this purpose are : Capital ships     ... ... ... ...      12Aircraft carriers ... ... ... ...        5Cruisers ... ... ... ...      46Apart from those attached to the Fleet, this force of cruisers will be called upon to protect our sea communications to India, Australia and the East. With a total of 50 cruisers, only 4 would remain for the protection of all our other sea communications, particularly those in the vital home area and the Atlantic.38. It is apparent, therefore, that this number (50) is inadequate, and from an examination of this problem it is considered by the Admiralty that at least 20 additional cruisers, besides the equipment of a large number of armed merchant cruisers already arranged for, would be required to safeguard our world-wide communications against the possible attacks of Japanese cruisers, raiders or submarines.39. As regards capital ships, until 1936 it is anticipated that the Japanese battle fleet will not be at full strength owing to the absence of ships undergoing modernisation. It is therefore under consideration to lay up 4 of our capital ships simultaneously in the years 1934 and 1935 for modernisation. After that date, and until the year 1940, 3 of our 15 capital ships will be continually absent from the Fleet for large repairs and will, therefore, not be available for varying periods which, at the worst, might amount to one year after the emergency arises.40. In the preceding paragraphs the actual position as regards units of the Fleet has been set out, but this is only one aspect of the problem. The vessels have got to be manned, provisioned and maintained, and in this connection we would emphasise that only some 60 per cent, of the oil fuel reserves worked out and approved in 1925 have been accumulated, and, since the year 1930, a halt has been called in the programme on the responsibility of the Cabinet. The accumulation of fuel reserves is of great importance and unless resumed cannot be completed within a reasonable number of years.41. It has not been possible, on account of financial stringency and the application of the &quot;ten-year&quot; rule, to build up the reserves of equipment required for the naval services in war, and serious deficiencies exist in regard to reserves of ammunition, torpedoes, mines, anti-submarine weapons and craft.(c) Army Responsibilities.42. The main responsibility of the Army in the Far East is the provision of adequate defences for the bases from which our Fleet could operate in time of emergency. In addition, of course, the Army has to carry out its normal &apos;&apos; police force &quot; functions in respect of British interests.43. We have referred in paragraphs 30-34 to the position of the Singapore Base, which must be regarded as the major responsibility. In addition, garrisons are maintained at Hong Kong, Shanghai and Tientsin.   Reference to theprotection of our sea communications with the Dominions, India, the Colonial Empire and throughout the world. The sea communications in the Indian Ocean and Australasian waters would be- the most exposed by reason of their comparative proximity to Japan; but in all other oceans, too, our shipping would be exposed to attack by enemy cruisers, submarines or merchant ship raiders.36. For the purpose of this Review, it is assumed that the London Naval Treaty will be observed until its expiration and that the main forces of the Japanese Fleet will not vary appreciably before, say, 1940, from those which they
unsatisfactory position in these latter areas was made in paragraphs 21 and 22 of our Eeport on the Situation.in the Ear East (C.I.D. Paper No. 1103-B) and need not be repeated here.(d) Air Force Responsibilities.44. The Japanese Air Force, with a first-line strength of some 470 aircraft with air equipment and a standard of training fast approaching that of the major European Powers, is the predominant factor in the air situation of the Far East. The bulk of the Japanese land-based aircraft are stationed in Japan, but air routes have been organised and bases provided so that squadrons can be moved rapidly between Korea, Japan and Formosa. The latter is within flying distance of the China coast. By using Chinese territory, Japan could establish air forces within striking distance of Hong Kong.45. Furthermore, the Japanese Fleet Air Arm with a carrier capacity of 152 aircraft, and with 76 torpedo bombers normally embarked, provides the means of attacking both Singapore and Hong Kong from beyond the range of the gun defences.46. The minimum air strengths which are considered necessary to meet these scales of attack and to co-operate in the defence of our eastern bases against all other forms of attack are discussed below: In order to provide a deterrent to attacks by aircraft operating from carriers which have evaded our naval forces, reconnaissance aircraft are necessary to find the carriers, and torpedo bombers to attack and destroy them when found. Some aircraft of higher performance may also be necessary to deal with aircraft which may have been despatched from enemy ships before they can be attacked.47. The necessary number of aircraft of the required type must be at singapore-pore before the attacking force could reach it, but owing to the speed with which squadrons can be moved when conditions are suitable, only a proportion need be located there in normal times, the remainder being obtained, when necessary, from neighbouring commands, where they can be engaged in useful work in time of peace. Such a policy depends, however, on the provision of the necessary facilities at Singapore to enable the full number of squadrons to operate on the outbreak of war, and also on the organisation of air routes so that squadrons could pass along them without delay at any time of year and in any weather conditions.48. The route between Calcutta and Singapore is now suitable for rapid moves during the winter and spring months, but the provision of additional landing grounds and W/T and meteorological facilities is necessary to overcome the delays which occur during the summer and autumn. Negotiations are now taking place with the Government of India. Since the improvements are primarily required in order to increase the security of Singapore, it would seem probable that the responsibility for these improvements must rest on His Majesty&apos;s Government. It is, however, important that the organisation of this air route should be completed as soon as possible.49. One land plane squadron (torpedo bombers) and one flying boat squadron are already at Singapore, and in accordance with the recent Cabinet decision a further torpedo bomber squadron is being sent out this autumn, as one of the immediate measures for the greater security of the Base. The strength of the Air Force which will require to be stationed at Singapore as well as the facilities required for their operation, are subjects of great importance, which we propose to review in the near future in the light of the recommendations of the Sub-Committee on Coast Defence (C.I.D. Paper No. 370-C).50. Plans are now being prepared for the quick movement of Air reinforce-ments to Singapore in case of emergency.51. The provision of adequate aerodrome accommodation for the defending squadrons is a matter of great importance, as is also their protection from air attack whilst on the ground. It may be necessary to take further steps to improve the position in both these respects.52. The defence of Hong Kong is rendered especially difficult by the terms of the Washington Treaty, which precludes any increase in the number and size
of the fixed defences. The means of maintaining the efficiency of the defences are, therefore, strictly limited, and, apart from the modernisation of the existing artillery and provision of an adequate land garrison, are practically confined to the development of the air facilities and air forces at Hong Kong.53. As stated in paragraph 44 above, Japan could establish an air base on the Chinese mainland and bring a heavy scale of air attack to bear on Hong Kong, against which we have, at present, no aircraft allocated for the defence of the port. The question of what air squadrons and facilities are to be provided is one which must depend on the general policy to be adopted regarding the defence of Hong Kong.54. The provision of the air forces necessary for general defence and for defence against air attack is complicated by two factors (i) The absence of landing ground facilities.(ii) The lack of an air&quot; route in British territory along which reinforcement could be sent from other commands.55. With regard to (i), an aerodrome has now been completed at Kai Takr but this is incapable of containing more than three squadrons of land planes and two of sea-planes. It is also exposed to bombardment by sea and air, and additional landing grounds are essential if adequate air forces are to operate in the defence of the port. Owing to the nature of the surrounding country, landing grounds cannot be improvised, and it will be necessary to prepare any additional sites in peace time. Such sites will, however, have to be outside the defended area.56. Provision of connecting air routes as considered in (ii) above is also a matter of extreme difficulty and until this can be overcome it will be necessary to station a larger number of aircraft at Hong Kong in peace time than would otherwise be economic.(ii) European Commitments.(a) General.57. The Foreign Office Review of 1933 draws attention to the serious deterioration of the political situation in Europe during the last two years, and as stated in paragraph 11 we have reached the conclusion that we are now faced with a further major problem in Europe.58. From a purely military point of view by far the most disturbing factor in the situation is the recrudescence of militarism in Germany. In this Review we propose to deal only with the military implications of the situation and to draw attention to the serious commitments which may arise out of this situation and our policy to meet them.59. Since the war successive German Governments have pursued a logical policy with one object always in view the revision of the peace treaties. It is not the policy which has changed with the advent of Herr Hitler, but only the methods. What was being done by stealth and subterfuge is now proclaimed in a most open manner. The first stage in the policy which has been consistently pursued by Germany was the elimination of the most objectionable clauses of the peace treaties reparations and military occupation. This stage has been completed. The second stage is rearmament and the recognition of the German demand for equality in armament is undoubtedly a step towards the completion of this stage. The first two stages are stepping stones to the third the revision of frontiers, particularly in Eastern Europe, and including, to judge by recent events, some kind of German control, direct or indirect, over Austria. It is even, possible that these may lead to a final stage, an attempt to recover the Colonial Empire.60. The immediate danger lies not in the West, but in the East of Europe. An attack on France by Germany is hardly likely to be a feasible operation of war for some years to come. The French have been spending some  35,000,000 in elaborating a system of frontier defences which have rendered their eastern frontier immeasurably stronger than in 1914 and probably impregnable to land attack except by extensive and elaborate siege operations. It is inconceivable that the Germans with their bitter experiences of the last war would be so foolish as again to invade France and to seek a solution in a rapid knock-out blow..
Indeed, Herr Hitler has frankly stated that &quot; to attack France for a purely sentimental reason would be foolish. What Germany needs is an increase in territory in Europe.&apos;&apos;   Such an increase can only be gained in the East.61. In the determination to recover her lost territory in the East, the whole of Germany is united, and it is with a view to this, rather than to a war with France, that the evolution of the German military forces, and especially the Army, may be expected to be planned. But, at the moment, the most urgent necessity is for a period of national consolidation and of preparation before an attempt to regain the lost territory is made. This is the key to Herr Hitler&apos;s ;speech of the 17th May. During this period of preparation we may expect, there-fore, to see pacific utterances on the part of the Government paralleled by -a violent and bellicose propaganda of the Nazi Party, together with a steady preparation for war.62. In the event of failure to reach an agreement at Geneva, there is little doubt that we shall be faced with the determination of Germany openly to rearm,. * .a determination which in the last resort can only be resisted by force. On the other hand, were agreement to be obtained at Geneva, we must anticipate that Germany will, under the guise of moderation, continue her secret prepara-tions during the period of respite, and until she feels strong enough to throw off the mask and to attain her ends in a war of offence in the East, combined, if necessary, with a defensive in the West.63. It would therefore seem that at any time within the next, say, three to five years we may be faced with demands for military intervention on the Continent, either as a result of repercussions arising out of attempts to prevent German rearmament by means of threats or sanctions, or in order to implement our obligations to provide assistance in case of aggression by Germany under the Covenant of the League or the Locarno Treaties.64. The Foreign Office Review of 1933 again draws attention to the solemn obligations which we have undertaken under these various pacts and covenants, and states that &quot; the more the nations of Europe become convinced of our readiness to fulfil our guarantee, the less likelihood will there be that we shall be called upon to do so.&quot; This may be true; but we feel it our duty to call attention to the slender means which we should have at our disposal for carrying out these guarantees, and the dangers to the defence of the Empire which such action on our part might entail.65. As mentioned in paragraph 25, the European responsibilities which may devolve upon the three Services are those connected with the Treaty of Locarno, and might result in our being drawn into war (a) with France against Germany, or (b) theoretically, at any rate, with Germany against France. We nave already indicated that we regard the latter contingency as an unlikely one. France, it is true, has been included among the nations by which we calculate the strength of certain of our Imperial Defence forces. For example, the connection between the strength of our Destroyer forces and the numbers of French Submarines has been recognised in published statements; and the first :stage of the expansion programme of the Royal Air Force was calculated in relation to the strength of the French Air Force. But the Air Force for Home Defence is still far from complete, and our general defensive schemes based on a war with France, in such matters as air defence, anti-aircraft and coast defence, have only been implemented to a limited extent. The result is that a leavy leeway exists which would have to be made good before we could contemplate without the gravest misgiving any breach in our good relations with France. The question of whether, and how far, these particular deficiencies are to be allowed to accumulate is one of policy which can only be decided by higher authority. In the absence of such a decision, and on a review of our defensive commitments as a whole, we make no recommendation on the subject.66. In these circumstances we do not propose to overload this Review with particulars of the deficiencies in the Defence Departments which prevent us from implementing the theoretical commitments of a war in alliance with -Germany against France.   In order, however, that the Committee of Imperial
Defence may be generally informed, we attach in an Appendix some notes on the subject to which we invite; attention,     .,,    &apos; , , ,    -67. The remainder of this section, therefore, is devoted to an examination of our position in the event of a war connected with the Treaty of Locarno, in which we are fighting with France against Germany. . &apos;       &apos;(b) Naval.Responsibilities. . . . . vj.:.68. The naval dangers to which this country is exposed in the latter eventuality are a seaborne raid or loss of control of the Home terminal area, which might result in the dangerous stoppage of our trade and supplies. While submarines, destroyers and aircraft would provide a strong deterrent to Germany attempting to undertake a seaborne raid, the defeat of such a raid is dependent on the surface control of the Channel or the North Sea by superior fighting-strength in that area and ultimately on capital ships. Similarly, the control of the Home terminal area is dependent on this force supplemented by cruisers, destroyers, and aircraft sufficient to provide security for the trade passing-through the area. If we had only the existing German Navy to consider, these risks would be negligible, but when the possibility of simultaneous trouble in the Far East is taken into consideration, the matter assumes a different complexion,, and we should become largely dependent upon our allies.69. Although His Majesty&apos;s Government, in the absence of our Main Fleet, could never, we presume, confide the entire protection of this country and its vital sea communications to a foreign Navy, yet, if France were our ally, her naval forces could undertake part of this responsibility. A total capital ship, cruiser and destroyer strength in Home waters to give equality with that of Germany is the least that could be accepted.70. The only German naval forces that can cause us any anxiety at present are their capital ships, particularly their small battle-cruisers of the Deutschland class. Provided that the European situation remains quiet for a sufficient time to enable us, after sending the. Main Fleet to the Far East, to bring forward for service two of the capital ships undergoing large repairs, and assuming additional cruisers as suggested in paragraph 38 above, we should be in no naval danger in an alliance with France against Germany whilst at the same time fighting Japan in the Far East.(c) Army Responsibilities.71. Since the war the insistent demands for economy, coupled with the assumption that there will be no major war for ten years, have resulted in the reduction of the British Army to a force which is barely sufficient to provide for internal security in the Empire and on mobilization to form an expeditionary force which can only be mobilized gradually for a campaign in undeveloped or partially developed countries in the East.72. The Government has, in fact, deliberately accepted the risk of spreading the mobilization of the regular divisions over a period of six months. Our present resources do not permit us even to aim at anything better than to place in the field single divisions in each of the first two months of the war, a third at the end of the fourth month and the remaining two divisions at the end of the sixth month.73. Not only is the army deficient in personnel and reserves which can be called up on mobilization, but the demands for economy have prevented us from providing the modern equipment and the extremely important and expensive item of sufficient reserves of ammunition which would be necessary for war on the continent of Europe, and even for a major emergency on the Frontiers of India. To provide the expeditionary force of five infantry divisions and a cavalry division with the necessary new equipment would involve a large capital outlay or a large increase in the annual estimates if the work is to be spread over a period of years. The provision of the necessary personnel to enable the whole expedi-tionary force to take the field at once or even within three months, would also in any case require money and time to obtain the necessary men to meet our deficits.74. The most we could do at present if called upon to intervene in Europe, and it is probably well known to both our friends and enemies, would be to provide
a small contingent of, say, one or at most two divisions at the outbreak of war, equipping them to a certain extent at the expense of later divisions preparing to go overseas. . . .75. To launch so small a force into war on the continent would only be of value from the moral point of view, but most dangerous from every other aspect, since if it became involved in serious fighting we should be unable to reinforce it with adequately equipped units and formations for many months. One of the great lessons of the last war is that it is impossible to limit the liability once we are committed to any theatre of operations. Moreover, the repercussions of war on the continent are impossible to foresee, but it is certain that in the present circumstances we should be faced with difficulties in many parts of the world which would strain our resources as they exist to-day to the utmost limit.76. Soviet Russia is our avowed enemy and would certainly create trouble by intensive propaganda in India and Egypt, even if she did not resort to open hostilities. During the last few years our relations with Japan have not been of the happiest. In the event of our becoming engaged in a war in Europe, we should no longer, as in 1914, have a staunch ally to guard our interests in the Far East. In fact, we are forced to the conclusion that, should war break out in Europe, far from our having the means to intervene, we should be able to do little more than hold the frontiers and outposts of the Empire during the first few months of the war.-(d) Air Farce- Responsibilities.77. The present ratio of air strengths between this country, France and Germany leads to an air situation which differs widely according to the side on which we are fighting. With France as an ally, however, we should, under existing conditions, have overwhelming air superiority, and the forces necessary for our own protection and to assist our ally could be found out of those authorised for the defence of Great Britain, provided always that no major commitment, such as war with Soviet Russia or in the.Far East, occurred simultaneously. In this latter contingency, however, the situation will be one of considerable anxiety.78, In the meantime, our weakness in the air, in comparison with other Great Powers, continues, and, in the words of the late Lord Balfour, the mere fear of hostilities may &apos;&apos; in quite conceivable circumstances greatly weaken British diplomacy, and may put temptation in the way of French Statesmen which they would find it hard to resist&quot; (C.I.D. Paper No. 108-A). The expansion programme of the Royal Air Force should, therefore, be continued without further delay.(iii) The Defence of India against Soviet Aggression.(a) General.! 79: The remaining commitment of importance is the Defence of India against Soviet aggression, and, as stated in paragraph 20, under certain circum-:stances&apos; this might involve operations with the object of maintaining the integrity -of Afghan territory.80. As will be shown in the succeeding paragraphs, the position of the Army :and the Air Force in respect of their responsibilities in this particular commit-ment are rather paradoxical. So far as the Army are concerned, if they were able to meet potential commitments in Europe, then they would also be in a position to implement the Defence of India Plan. With the Air Force, however, the position is exactly the reverse. If they had sufficient forces to implement the Defence of India Plan, then they would also be in a position to meet potential commitments in Europe, short of supporting Germany against France.v(b) Naval Responsibilities.81. The Navy are in a position to implement their responsibilities under the Defence of India Plan. Such responsibilities would, in the main, consist of the -safeguarding of lines of communication.
(c)\ Army Responsibilities.- &apos;821 So far as the Army&apos;is concerned, the main commitment outside Europe is undoubtedly India, and it is to meet this commitment that the expeditionary force is organised to-day so far as financial limitations have allowed. The. Plan for the Defence of India and, in certain circumstances, of Afghanistan, is based on the assumption that, in the first instance, the brunt of the campaign must be borne by the, Army in India, in co-operation with the Air Force. Owing to the undeveloped nature of the probable theatre of operations, there is a very definite limit to the size of the force which it is possible to maintain in the field during the first few months, and until the communications have been constructed and developed. Assistance from the Army at home, therefore, is required in the form of contingents arriving at intervals over a period of several months as the lines of communication become capable of dealing with them. At the same time, it is proposed to build up a reserve in the Middle East to preserve order and to deal with the situation should the conflict spread to other countries in the Mohammedan block.83. It will be possible to provide the personnel required for these forces, but our resources as regards material are at present insufficient and, in the case of tanks, totally inadequate.84. It will, therefore, be clear that, although our existing resources in personnel may possibly enable us to meet our commitments as regards the Defence of India during the first six months of the campaign, our serious deficiencies as regards reserves of material and ammunition would make it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to provide the forces which it is estimated will be required for the development of the Plan in its later stages.(d) Air Force Responsibilities.85. The Defence of India Plan calls for the employment of 28 squadrons from the United Kingdom, of which 24 are bombers and fighters. This number constitutes almost half the 52 squadrons, which, according to the present Cabinet ruling,* are to be provided by 1938 for the Home Defence Air Force. Up to the present only 42 of these squadrons, including 13 on a non-regular basis, have been formed. It is clear, therefore, that the despatch of 28 squadrons would, in existing circumstances, leave this country virtually defenceless as regards the air,, and the formation of the remaining 10 squadrons is therefore a necessary-preliminary to the provision of the air units required by the Defence of India plan.86. Furthermore, little or no provision has yet been made for the necessary reserves of aircraft, engines, transport and general stores, nor (since existing-units are primarily intended for Home Defence) for the organisation of the maintenance services necessary to enable squadrons to operate in a distant, theatre of war.87. The strength of the air forces to be provided for the Defence of India Plan is the minimum, necessary in view of the size of the Russian air force and the special conditions of the theatre of war. It is therefore essential that all squadrons should be able to operate at their full capacity throughout the-campaign.88. On the basis of a casualty rate somewhat below that experienced during the last war, it is estimated that a 100 per cent, stored reserve of aircraft would be necessary to tide over the period until the output of the aircraft industry could overtake wastage; and that, unless this reserve is built up in peace, our effort may have to be reduced at a critical period of the campaign. This reserve would be necessary for the 28 squadrons from the United Kingdom and for the 8 squadrons in India, which form part of the fdrees operating in Afghanistan, while an adequate reserve of training aircraft would also be-required. This figure is also based on the assumption that air operations are-confined to the N.W. Frontier and to Afghanistan, and that there is no abnormal activity elsewhere. . , .,* Cabinet 32 (23) as amended by Cabinet&apos;52 (29).
89. The situation regarding personnel is also unsatisfactory, and special arrangements will be necessary for training the existing reserves of pilots, and for increasing the key personnel required by the maintenance services. The Tatter is the most serious deficiency, for, of the two aircraft depots and six air stores parks which would be required to sail within four months of the outbreak of war, the personnel at present is only available for one aircraft depot and two air stores parks.  Measures are therefore necessary to improve the position in this respect-TV. -Summary.90. We have attempted in this review to take general stock of our position in relation to the commitments into which His Majesty&apos;s Government have entered at various times. These commitments, as set out on page 61 of the Foreign Office review, number some twenty-four in all, but, since many of them are of a nature which would call for little or no military effort, we have confined ourselves to the situation affecting the three mentioned in paragraph 21, which, in our opinion, must form the criterion of our defence requirements.91. We have shown what, in our opinion, these commitments might entail and the forces at our disposal to implement them, but without taking into account the unlikely contingency of war with France or Italy.92. Although, as we have said, we believe Germany already to have started that rearmament which, in the nature of things, was sooner or later to be expected, we do not believe that she will deliberately disturb the peace of Europe at the present moment; though there is always the danger that the forces which Herr Hitler is encouraging may get out of control or that some &quot; incident &quot; may occur and precipitate a crisis. In the Far East, also, there must always be anxieties, though for the moment the situation has temporarily improved. It is, however, cur duty not to look solely at the immediate future, but to look ahead and to place before His Majesty&apos;s Government the position which may arise in :a few years&apos; time if the situation is allowed to develop on lines which seem probable.93. Serious deficiencies in all departments of our Defence Forces, to which we have drawn attention, cannot be made good in a hurry, yet the nature of modern weapons and scientific armament development renders surprise attack on a considerable scale and with weapons of great destructive power more possible than in the past. The old idea that a nation can &quot; muddle through &quot; possesses inherent dangers in the light of the speed with which aggressive action can be initiated in these days.94. The position in respect of the three major commitments with which we have dealt may be summarised as follows ; Naval Responsibilities.(i) The dominating factors, as always, are Capital-ship strength and Cruiser strength. We are unable to safeguard fully our communications in a war against Japan with our present Cruiser forces, as has been frequently stated by the Naval ,Staff, who calculate that at least 70 Cruisers are required.(ii) The oil-fuel reserves necessary for the operations of the Fleet are some -40 per cent, short of the total required.(iii) Serious deficiencies exist in regard to reserves of ammunition, torpedoes, mines, anti-submarine weapons and craft required for the Naval Services in war.(iv) The seaward defences of our principal bases in the Far East for which the Admiralty are responsible have not yet been provided on the necessary scale, though progress is now, being made. - .(v) In a war with France against Germany, our naval forces would be adequate. We should be: capable of carrying on a war simultaneously in the Far East, provided we can bring forward for service two of the capital ships likely to be undergoing large repairs in sufficient time to meet the European
situation and assuming that ,the deficiencies-summarised in paragraphs (i), (ii) and (iii) above have been made good. , , .. (vi) The Navy are in a: position to implement their responsibilities under the Defence of India Plan, since this would, consist mainly in the safeguarding of lines of communication.; , ...Army Responsibilities.(vii) The modernisation of the fixed defences at Singapore is proceeding, hut at other ports in the Far East, notably Hong-Kong and Trincomali, the defences are still deficient.(viii) We are not to-day in a position to intervene effectually in a Continental war with our land forces for many months.(ix) Limited participation in a European war would not be feasible, and to commit a proportion of our slender military resources to the Continent would, in view of the world situation to-day, be fraught with the gravest danger.(x) Unless His Majesty&apos;s Government is prepared to place our armed forces in a necessary state of preparation for participation in modern warfare on the Continent, our military action must be confined, at any rate during the first six months of a war, to the defence of the Empire overseas.(xi) It will be possible to provide the personnel required for the forces to carry out the Defence of India Plan, but our resources as regards material are insufficient and, in the case of tanks, totally inadequate.(xii) After six months of the campaign serious deficiencies as regards material, ammunition, &amp;c, would make it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to provide the forces which it is estimated would be required for the development of the Plan in its later stages.Air Force Responsibilities.(xiii) The question of the provision on a permanent basis of the necessary Air Force for both Singapore and Hong Kong, as well as the facilities for their operation, are serious matters which will require examination in the near future.(xiv) The air route from Calcutta to Singapore requires improvement in order to enable reinforcing squadrons to move without delay at any time of year.(xv) The absence of landing-ground facilities at Hong Kong and the lack of an air route in British territory along which reinforcements could be sent from other commands is a matter for anxiety, and any measures to prepare additional sites must necessarily take some time.(xvi) In a war with France against Germany, our air requirements would be met out of the means authorised for the defence of Great Britain, provided always no major commitment, such as war with Soviet Russia or in the Far East, occurred simultaneously. The expansion programme of the Royal Air Force should be continued without further delay.&apos;(xvii) For the Defence of India Plan the necessary maintenance services to enable 28 Squadrons to be despatched in accordance with the time-table laid down in the Plan would have to be provided.(xviii) The reserves of aircraft and personnel which are required until the war output of both is sufficient for current requirements should also be provided.General.(xix) For the present the general priority of expenditure on Imperial Defence should be based on the following assumptions :- (1) The defence of our Possessions and interests in the Far East;-(2) European Commitments;(3) The defence of India against Soviet aggression.     :&apos; ;V95. Conscious of our financial dangers, we have purposely avoided specific proposals for the immediate provision of extra funds. Nevertheless;, the accumulation of deficiencies resulting from the long continuance of the &quot;&quot;ten-year &quot; rule is very heavy, and, if we are to be ready for the grave
emergencies referred to above, a steady increase in certain of our Estimates over a number of years is essential. Meanwhile, the position of the Defence Depart-ments is very difficult. Their responsibility is no longer covered by the &quot;ten-year&quot; rule, which has become inapplicable, but the deficiencies remain. The international situation is steadily deteriorating and if the Disarmament Conference fails the whole position of our Imperial Defence Forces will have to be reviewed. No guiding principle has yet been established to replace the &quot;ten-year&quot; rule. We ask the Committee of Imperial Defence whether they confirm generally our appreciation of the situation as set forth above, and whether they can give any further guidance to the Government Departments responsible for Imperial Defence.(Signed) ERNLE CHATFIELD.A.

For example, supposing we were engaged in a war in the Far East, and even though the situation in home waters vis-a-vis European Powers remained normal, it would still be necessary to maintain a certain minimum force for the protection of our sea communications in the vital areas of the Home terminal area, the Atlantic and the Mediterranean. The forces of France, Italy and Germany that we have taken into consideration in this Review are as follows : Capital ships (available for immediate  British.  France.   Italy.   Germany, operation)BattleshipsBattle-cruisers Cruisers (8-inch), modern Cruisers (6-inch), modern Aircraft-carriers ... Flotilla leaders Destroyers SubmarinesNotes. Capital ship numbers in brackets are in accordance with statements &apos; recently made by members of the Delegations at Geneva.* Under large repair not immediately available. ! Old battleships of pre-war design.From this table it will be seen that the naval forces that would be available to fulfil these responsibilities are quite insufficient, and the situation that might arise under the conditions postulated in this Appendix would be one of the utmost anxiety and gravity. -(i) If Italy remained neutral, at the same time as we were involved in hostilities in the Far East, the addition of the German navy to that portion of ours remaining in European waters would make a force quite inadequate to deal with the French fleet. It would, therefore, be impossible for us to engage successfully in a war against France with Germany as our only ally whilst involved in hostilities in the Far East.(ii) Under the normal operations of the Locarno Pact, however, Italy should be our ally, but, taking into consideration that the greater part of our Fleet was already east of Suez and thus that Italy&apos;s sea communications would be exposed to the immediate attack of French naval forces, it is at least doubtful whether Italy would engage in the war.(iii) If she did, she would to a great extent balance the Fleet of France in the Mediterranean, but it is considered that we should have to provide in home waters a Fleet of not less than Capital ships      ...          ... ... ... 3Modern cruisers (6-inch or 8-inch) ... ... 6Aircraft carriers ...          ... ... ... 1Destroyers          ...          ... ... ... 36in addition to increased cruiser forces in the north and south Atlantic and a powerful anti-submarine force to deal with the strong French submarine force.
(iv) With -our Fleet in the East we could not provide these forces owing principally to the large repairs necessary to certain of our capital ships and to our lack of cruisers. , There would be a serious deficiency of anti-submarine vessels, particularly; if and when we, have reduced our destroyer force to the 150,000 tons allowed by the London Naval Treaty, unless French submarine forces were markedly reduced. There would, also, be a shortage of fast minersweeping vessels. .. . -(v) There would, also, be additional dangers until&apos;the Fleet bases nearer home, such as Berehaven and Sierra Leone, are adequately defended, and the defences of Malta and Gibraltar strengthened.(vi) If we were already engaged in a war with Japan, therefore, even though Italy were an ally, the situation from the naval point of view would be extremely dangerous.Army.(vii) The size of the Expeditionary Force, which is at present maintained, would require to be brought up to the standard of 1914, both as regards numbers and efficiency.(viii) Our coast defences would have to be entirely remodelled and brought up to date. As shown in sub-paragraph (v) above, this applies not only to those in Great Britain and Ireland, but also to Sierra Leone, Gibraltar and Malta.(ix) The anti-aircraft defences of London would have to be put on a satisfactory footing.Air Force.(x) If it were necessary to support Germany against France, this country might be exposed to the full scale of French air attack, to meet which would entail an expansion of our Home Defence Air Force considerably beyond the 52 squadrons already authorised.(xi) Aircraft would also be required to co-operate in the protection-of certain overseas dependencies, more especially the West African Colonies and Malta, which are liable to a considerable scale of air attack.(xii) The situation regarding personnel would, also, be unsatisfactory and special arrangements would be necessary for training the existing reserves of pilots and for increasing the key personnel required by the maintenance services.(xiii) Provision would, also, have to be made for the necessary reserves of aircraft, engines, transport, and general stores sufficient to meet the needs of expansion.(xiv) Our requirements in existing circumstances are beyond our present resources and would entail a very large expansion of the Air Force.o
THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Committee of Imperial Defence.   November 1933.SECRET. Copy No.    33COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.Extract from the Draft Minutes of the 2Qlst Meeting, held on November 9, 1933.(1)-IMPERIAL DEFENCE POLICY.(OLD. Papers Nos. 1112-B and 1113-B.)(Previous reference : OLD. Minutes of 255th Meeting, Minute 4.)THE COMMITTEE had under consideration (i) Annual Review by theChiefs of Staff Sub-Committee (OLD. Paper No. 1113-B), and (ii) papersprepared for the use of the Chiefs of Staff in their Annual Review (Paper No. C.I.D. 1112-B).THE PRIME MINISTER regretted that it had been necessary to alter the date of the meeting, and then to change it back again, but he knew members of the Committee would appreciate the difficulties at the present time. Referring to the Chiefs of Staff Report, he would remark that this was the first Review since the Cabinet had cancelled the assumption that there would be no major war for ten years, and that, as a result, the Report had been made more comprehensive than had been the case in the last three years. It stated the position of the three Defence Services in relation to what were considered to be the three major commitments (i) the defence of our possessions in the Far East; (ii) European commitments;(iii) the defence of India against Soviet  or, as he added, any other aggression.These were very important commitments.In regard to Europe, the Treaty of Locarno was rightly taken as the most important commitment and occupied a large part of the Review. It was made on the assumption that we might have to implement this Treaty in support of France, but he would remind the Committee that, of course, we might have to implement it also in support of Germany. He thought that from a political point of vieAv he could agree with the Chiefs of Staff that, if a Locarno commitment had to be carried out the chances were that it would be on the side of France. The Chiefs of Staff summarised their Report in paragraphs 90-94 on page 14; and on page 15 in paragraph 94 (xix) it was stated &quot; for the present the general priority of expenditure on Imperial Defence should be based on the following assumptions (i) the defence of our possessions and interests in the Far East; (ii) European commitments;(iii) the defence of India against Soviet aggression.&quot; He would be grateful for observations from the Committee on this Report.LORD PIAILSHAM said that on page 16, at the end of paragraph 95, the Chiefs of Staff pointed out how difficult their position was, and he thought there would be general agreement with this statement. Defence preparations had been allowed steadily to go down-hill because of the operation of the Ten-year Rule. The Ten-year Rule had now disappeared, but the deficiencies remained. He. [9264-1] B
thought the Chief s of Staff would like the Committee to confirm their appreciation of the situation, and would be glad if any further guidance could be given them in the formulation of their future policy. The Prime Minister had said that, from a political point of view, he could agree with the Chiefs of Staff in estimating that the most likely method by which we might have, to implement Locarno would be to help Prance against Germany. He would like to emphasise a further point which the Chiefs of Staff had brought out, which was that it was quite impossible to fulfil our commitments under Locarno if we had to support Germany against France. That was the reason why they had drawn particular attention to the situation arising if we had to support France. Naturally, certain aspects of this question were of a political nature and outside their province, and they had merely drawn attention to a position which, from their point of view, was impossible.SIR ERNLE CHATFIELD said he had very little to add to the Report. He would like to point out that, with the exception of Singapore, no steps had been taken to retrieve the general position which had been brought about by the operation of the Ten-year Rule. It would take us at least five to ten years to make good the deficiencies. He was not sure that the Committee generally had realised the very serious nature of their position, and that was why the Chiefs of Staff were most anxious to receive guidance.Mr. CHAMBERLAIN said that the paragraph to which reference had been made at the end of paragraph 94 on page 15 concerned the priority of expenditure on Imperial defence. He noted that the Far East came first. He appreciated that the Chiefs of Staff were in an embarrassing position, in that the clause which had protected them for some time (that is, the Ten-year Rule) had been withdrawn, and it was quite natural for them to ask whether there was not something which could replace that Rule for their future guidance. He was wondering himself what fresh directions could be given to the Chiefs of Staff. It seemed to him it would be helpful if the Committee could make definite recommendations which might fulfil that desire. Was there no method by which the Chiefs of Staffs&apos; responsibilities could be limited ? His first suggestion was to ask how far it might be possible to eliminate certain Powers from their calculations that is to say, to lay down that preparations for defence against certain Powers were unnecessary. In paragraph 91 it was stated : &quot; We have shown what, in our opinion, these commitments might entail, and the forces at our disposal to implement them, but without taking into account the unlikely contingency of war with France or Italy.&quot; These were purely Euiopean Commitments, and he supposed that that was the reason why the United States had not been brought in.SIR MAURICE HANKEY intervened to remark that the United States had not for years been considered in Papers of this kind.Mr. CHAMBERLAIN, continuing, said the first thing he would like to suggest for consideration, therefore, was the possibility of laying down that in considering defence questions, account need not be taken of any likelihood of war with the United States, France or Italy during, say, the next ten years. He thought that if some such formula could be agreed it would reduce to some extent the proportions of the problem, and might have an important bearing on defence questions in general.There was a second point which he would like to make. He did not object to the order of priority which was put forward in this Report, but he was wondering whether it was desirable to lay down any such cut-and-dried order of priority in a general way when the situation was so fluid. It might quite conceivably be found, for example, that the situation in Europe became more urgent than the situation in the Far East. As regards the position in the Far East, he had always felt that this was related intimately to the question of bur relations with Japan. He had expressed deep regret at the action taken to break the alliance with Japan. Sir Maurice Hankey had been good enough to give him very full particulars as to the reasons which led to this policy, and, while.he appreciated the difficulties of the situation, he did not alter his opinion. He still considered that it was a mistake. He was afraid that it had gradually poisoned our relations with. Japan, and had led them to regard us with increasing suspicion.  He very much wished.we could make some effort now to improve our
relations&apos; with Japan. Some little time ago the late Chief of the Imperial General Staff (Lord Milne) had said some very weighty words in one of his Papers in this respect, and he thought the Foreign Secretary had also this problem in his mind. He was very glad to see in a report from Tokyo that-the opinion was expressed that Japan was looking to another quarter and not in our direction for a future conflict. He was particularly glad of this, because he had heard a contrary opinion frOm a responsible source. If it were possible to improve our relations with Japan the whole problem in the Far East would be much simplified, and it even might be possible to reduce the Far East in the order of priority. This was one of the reasons which led him to suggest that it might perhaps be unwise to commit ourselves too definitely to an order of priority, but rather to obtain the opinion of the Committee on this question from time to time. He suggested that perhaps it would be possible to adopt a resolution that would contain principles for guidance in the future, and make provision for a periodical review of the situation.SIR JOHN SIMON said he had had the Chiefs of Staff Report examined in all the various Departments of the Foreign Office. He found that the Foreign Office had come to very much the same opinion as the Chiefs of Staff. He would like to draw particular attention to two points : firstly, he did not think that our diplomatic relations with Japan were bad at all. The Japanese were behaving extremely correctly, but he would remind the Committee that in any question of trying to approach closer to Japan they must remember that the strength of Japanese conduct was governed by the fact that she had a definite objective, which was to make herself a great Power in the East. To do this, she would require territory and raw materials and other things. Having regard to this fact, if was difficult for him to see how far, from a diplomatic point of view, it would be possible to alter the radical fact that Japan had got this objective. If she were ever in a position to persuade the disorganised masses in China that she was the leader of the Yellow Peoples, then there might arise a very grave peril. He would also remind the Committee that the reasons which were given by Lord Balfour for the dropping of the Japanese alliance did not necessarily hold good to-day. In 1922 at Washington, Lord Balfour had recalled to mind the fact that the alliance had come into being because of the aggressive attitude adopted in the Far East by Russia and Germany. He had then asked, after detailed study of the position, whether it could be said at that date (1922) that the Russian danger or the peril from Germany still existed, and the answer to both of these questions had been in the negative. The question then arose as to why it was necessary to have the Treaty, particularly in view of the fact that it would have been impossible to get agreement with the United States if the Treaty had continued. There were two difficulties, therefore, which had to be taken into account in the conduct of our policy in the Far East. We must preserve, if possible, the sympathy of the United States; and, on the other hand, we must try to bring about better relations with Japan. Personally, he was very impressed with the fact that Japan had given notice to leave the League and that Germany had done the same. He would like to know how to estimate the situation if a position arose when Germany and Japan might come together, and it seemed to him such a situation was conceivable when Germany was sufficiently strong to take a hand against us. He thought, that would be a very alarming prospect. He would like to know how soon it might be expected that Germany would be in a position to do anything effective.SIR ARCHIBALD MONTGOMERY-MASSINGBERD said he thought. Germany might be ready in approximately five years.SIR JOHN SIMON said that if that was the case that Germany would be-in a position to play an effective hand in five years, then she might look round for allies, and might therefore look to Japan. He saw great difficulties in improving our relations with Japan. They were at present quite good, but one always had a feeling in dealing with Eastern peoples that they were wearing a mask, behind which they might be conducting a policy, of their own. It was always difficult, to know what was going on inside the anthill.LORD HAILSHAM said he rather felt that Japan would occupy herself first in acquiring superiority in China.  He had had lunch yesterday with Chang So Lang, and had had a very interesting conversation.   Chang So Lang thought that the Chinese were much more concerned at the present moment with trying :    [9264-1] s 2
to re-create a unified China. They hated the present situation, and since&apos; they had seen Russia-a country of equally vast spaces achieve unified govern-ment, the youth of China was tending to turn to Red Army methods because of their apparent effectiveness. The Government at Nanking was inclined to make terms with Japan, and it seemed to him that the mass of people in China were more inclined to turn to Bolshevik methods. He and Sung were both alike in their appreciation of the outlook, and that was why Sung had resigned. Lord Hailsham thought Chang So Lang had talked frankly, and if what he had said was true it seemed likely that Japan would be occupied in consolidating her position in China in the next few years.Mr. THOMAS intervened to remark that in that case there would be some force in a policy of supporting China.SIR BOLTON EYRES MONSELL thought that what had been said strengthened his contention that we ought to be ready to defend our interests in the Far East, and it was particularly important for the Committee to give some guidance as to our defensive preparations in the Far East. It seemed to him essential that we should take some steps to improve our position, and it was very necessary for guidance to be given in the framing of estimates to make good obvious deficiencies.THE PRIME MINISTER said he was not being in the least critical of what had been said or of the Chiefs of Staff Report, but he felt we were faced with a very pessimistic outlook. If it would take Japan five years to do her work in China, it might then mean that she would be free to look elsewhere, which meant that we ought to be in a position to face Japan.Mr. CHAMBERLAIN said Sir Francis Lindley did not think that Japan had any ambitions outside China, and possibly outside Asia : certainly nothing in the direction of Australasia. On the other hand, if Japan&apos;s ambitions in China were thwarted, then a very different situation might arise.THE PRIME MINISTER said it was quite clear, he thought, that Japan in 1935 was going to ask for naval parity, and that apart from the consolidation of her position in China she was paying great attention to the sea at the moment.Mr. BRUCE said he thought that everything could be considered to-day on the practical basis described in paragraph 95 of the Review, where the Chiefs of Staff asked what help and guidance they could get now that the ten-year rule had gone. He was quite clear from what had been said that the situation was very serious. It seemed to him that five years was the maximum time in which we ought to be in a position to defend our interests, and it looked to him as if we had got to try to make good the major deficiencies in that period. This was a very difficult question from every point of view and, particularly, from the financial aspect, but he thought the danger was the possibility of Germany and Japan coming together and that Germany would be ready in five years&apos; time. It might be that Japan would concentrate generally on China, but there was always the possibilitjr that her aims in Asia might be thwarted and that she might then look elsewhere, and, quite apart from what he might call &quot; sane &quot; reasons, it could never be overlooked that some unfortunate incident might cause Japan to take a foolish action in a hurry. He thought it was important that this possibility should not be forgotten. That was the position that we might have to face if we could not make good our major deficiencies over a period of five years. He quite agreed with what the Chiefs of Staff had said in their Report and he thought the Far East was the outstanding danger. It was difficult to see what could prevent Japan obtaining a complete mastery of the Pacific if she chose to go to war between now and the time that Singapore was completed. At the present moment he felt we were powerless in the Far East. That was why he thought we ought to try and make good our position in this area. He agreed, with the point made by Mr. Chamberlain that these questions ought to be kept constantly under review, and he thought that the Far East should be the main concentration point at the present time, though, of course, circumstances might change, which would require a modification of this view. As regards Australia, herself, she was increasing her Defence Budget this year by approximately 1-1 million pounds, and the whole position was so serious, and it was so imperative
that deficiencies should be made good, that he thought it conceivable Australia, might, in some circumstances, be prepared to make a further effort. ,.THE PRIME MINISTER suggested that the Committee should pass some Resolution on the lines of the discussion which had taken place, and suggested the following: &quot;1. For the present, the expenditure of the Defence Departments should be governed by the Report of the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee and the following considerations of priority mentioned therein : The defence of our possessions and interests in the Far East; European commit-ments; the defence of India. 2. No expenditure should for the present be incurred on measures of defence required to provide exclusively against attack by the United States, France or Italy.3. The above conclusions must be kept under careful observation by the Government Departments concerned and, in any event, should be reviewed annually by the Committee of Imperial Defence.&quot;As regards the position in the Far East, he was anxious to know whether, anything was involved over and above the completion of Singapore.SIR ARCHIBALD MONTGOMERY-MASSINGBERD said that, from the Army point of view, the defence of our position in the Far East began at. Port Said, and that, within the three major commitments set out in the Chiefs of Staff Report, the Army had five commitments on which guidance would be needed.  These commitments were : The Expeditionary Force;The Bases in the Far East, starting from Port Said; The Naval Bases in the Mediterranean; The Home Coast Defences; The Air Defences of London.He was anxious to have guidance which would enable him to consider his estimates for this year. He would remind the Committee that, so far as Coast Defence was concerned, nothing had been done for fifteen years. Reserves of ammunition had been allowed to get low and the equipment and reserves for the Expeditionary Force were very backward as a result of the ten-year rule. He reminded the Committee that the Defence of India Plan allowed a very leisurely mobilisation and would not in any way meet a commitment in Europe.THE PRIME MINISTER thought the first step to be taken at present was to look into the proposals in detail and to put forward a programme in order to see what the position was. It seemed to him that it would be improper for the Committee to saddle themselves with a general declaration which would allow any of the separate Departments to bring up questions as and when they liked. One advantage which a Ministry of Defence would give and the advantages were by no means all one way-would be to co-ordinate the progress of defence commitments covering all three arms of the Service. This matter had been brought up recently at the Cabinet. As things were at present, it made it difficult for the Chancellor of the Exchequer when he received piecemeal demands. That was why he felt strongly that there must be some method of co-ordination. He would, also, remind the Committee that it was very necessary to keep an eye on the political situation and that it would be a bad thing for the Service Departments if they got a wash of hostile public opinion against them on any matter of principle. The Cabinet had studied the question from this point of view and he could not leave out also the very apposite observations of Mr. Bruce. We were in partnership and we all had difficulties in regard to finance and public opinion. It seemed to him the fundamental weakness at present was; a lack of co-ordinated study and the systematic creation of policy. He would like to handle this question now in a businesslike way and he suggested that some Resolution should be framed and passed by the Committee. His mind was working on having the matter handled, not by the Chiefs of Staff alone. Their duty was to inform the Committee of Imperial Defence of the worst case; and they would be open to reproach if they failed to do so, but he wanted some;
method which would co-ordinate all the views together and which would be responsible for amalgamating them in a logical way.LORD HAILSHAM wondered if it would help if the three Defence Departments each prepared a statement of their requirements to meet these commitments, together with an estimate of cost, and then for some Committee to examine and co-ordinate these returns and see how they could be reduced to practical proportions. Lord Milne, just before he left, had handed to him a Paper concerning the Defence of India Plan, the substance of which he had communicated to the Cabinet although he had not actually circulated the Paper. He imagined that both the Navy and the Air Force were also in a position to formulate their demands. When this had been done, he suggested that a Cabinet Committee should examine the returns with the assistance of expert advice. It was obvious that the expenditure required might be too great to contemplate and it would then be the duty of this Committee to arrange priorities and to decide on the most urgent requirements. He thought, in this way, it might be possible to reduce the problem to concrete proportions.Mr. THOMAS said that twelve months ago he had considered that the situation was very serious, and the present Report in discussion had only brought up to date what had been said then by the Services. He gathered a year ago that the Cabinet had had to weigh the relative urgencies of the defence requirements and the financial situation, and had then decided that the balance of risk was greater from an economic and financial point of view, and, therefore, they had decided that the economic and financial factors must be overriding. If any Committee was appointed it seemed to him that its -object should not be confined to the question of military expenditure and risk, but it should also examine the economic situation to see whether it had changed, and whether the incidents of risk had moved.Mr. CHAMBERLAIN said he thought the position at the moment was intermediate. Mr. Thomas was quite right when he said that the Cabinet had balanced the risks and decided that the financial situation was the most threatening, but it was only fair to admit that both sides of the case had now altered to some extent. It could hardly be said that the military situation had improved, although, perhaps, the financial situation was not quite so difficult. It seemed to him, therefore, that the centre of gravity of the problem had slightly shifted, but it was obvious that a good deal of examination must take place before actual co-ordination and before the material was in a form suitable for presentation to the Cabinet. He was wondering if it would not be possible in some way to sort out the proposals before they actually came to the Cabinet Committee. He had in mind the idea that officials of the various Departments concerned, working in close co-operation with the Chiefs of Staff, and with the help of representatives of the Treasury, the Foreign Office and Sir Maurice Hankey, could not first be asked to reduce the problem to more manageable proportions.LORD LONDONDERRY favoured Lord Hailsham&apos;s idea, and agreed that it was necessary that some step should be taken to co-ordinate defence require-ments. It seemed to him that if this was not done, the collective figure presented by the three Services would be one of alarming proportions. He agreed that it. might be easier to get the Departments working on the problem in the first place before the matter was considered by a Cabinet Committee.THE PRIME MINISTER was quite clear that some method of co-operation and co-ordination was very necessary. The three Defence Departments would presumably put in their requirements&apos;, and it then might be decided, for example, that 70 per cent, or 80 per cent, of these requirements could be granted, and it was very necessary for some body then to decide on the proper allotment of the ultimate percentage which it was thought could be accepted. He thought that-the Resolution he read out should be passed by the Committee as the0guiding principle arising from the Report, and that the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee, with the co-operation of the Treasury, Foreign Office and the Secretary to the Committee of Imperial Defence, should examine the whole question and should submit a Report to the Cabinet for their consideration.
....... v.,,.;-, .
