Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1933.Copy No.   36CABINET.THE    SOUTH    AFRICA    HIGH    COMMISSION    TERRITORIES-QUESTION OF TRANSFER TO THE UNION OF SOUTH AFRICA.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.WHEN General Smuts and Mr. Havenga were in London last summer they raised with me the question of the transfer to the Union of the three South Africa High Commission Territories, viz., Basutoland, the Bechuanaland Protectorate and Swaziland. These Territories, of which one Basutoland is entirely surrounded by, and the other two are contiguous to, the Union of South Africa, are administered on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom by the High Commissioner for South Africa, an officer who also holds the position of High Commissioner for the United Kingdom in the Union.2. When the Union was constituted by the South Africa Act of 1909, these Territories were excluded, mainly on account of the known opposition of the natives to being handed over to the future Union Government, but provision was made for their possible eventual transfer in section 151 of the Act, which empowered the King in Council, on addresses from both Houses of the Union Parliament, to transfer the administration of the Territories to the Union, subject to certain conditions, designed for the protection of native rights and interests, which were embodied in the Schedule to the Act.3. In view of this provision, the possibility of the transfer of the Territories has come up for discussion from time to time with the Union Government, but the native Chiefs in the Territories, whose views on this point may be regarded as coinciding with those of the members of their tribes, have never lost an opportunity to make clear their strong opposition to such transfer, and His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom have, on several occasions, given most specific assurances that no decision on any proposal for transfer would be reached until the natives had had a full opportunity of expressing their views. These assurances apply also to the white population, a certain section (though far from the whole) of whom admittedly favour transfer to the Union on economic grounds, but, as the great bulk of the inhabitants of the Territories are natives, obviously the views of the wdrite settlers could not be allowed to outweigh strong native opposition in a matter of this kind.A pledge was also given when the South Africa Bill was before the House of Commons that the House would have an opportunity of discussing, and, if they wished, of disapproving, any proposed transfer of the Territories to the Union; this pledge has been repeated on various occasions.4. When General Smuts and Mr. Havenga called to discuss the matter with me last July, I gave them a note (see Appendix A), in which attention was called to the various pledges given in the. past by His Majesty&apos;s Government as to consultation with the inhabitants of the Territories and with Parliament, and in which certain questions were also raised as to the effect of the passage of the Statute of Westminster on the safeguards intended to be provided by the Schedule to the South Africa Act.  As to this latter point, I may explain that, in view ofSECRET. CP. 262 (33).
the Statute of Westminster, we can no longer rely on the Schedule to the South Africa Act as affording in itself-a legal safeguard for Native rights and interests, since it is now possible for the Union Government to amend it as they please, or even repeal it. It was therefore necessary to make clear in the note that the transfer of the Territories could only be carried out subject to an agreement that the general scheme of the Schedule would be maintained.- Attention was also called in the note to the necessity of ascertaining what alternative forms of safeguard the Union Government would propose to substitute for the clauses in the Schedule which provide (a) that the King may disallow any law made.by the Governor-General in Council for any territory; (b) that Bills to amend or alter the provisions of the Schedule shall be, reserved for. the signification of His.Majesty&apos;s pleasure. Neither of these provisions provides any safeguard now, since His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom have no longer any locus standi in such matters.5. General Smuts subsequently sent me a memorandum (Appendix B) explaining the grounds on which the Union Government considered that the Territories ought to be transferred to the Union; but this memorandum did not touch upon the points raised in my note, and I accordingly sent a reply (Appendix C) to General Smuts, stating that he would no doubt be having these points further examined. I drew attention at the same time to the statements which had been made a few days previously in the House of Lords and in the House of Commons, reaffirming the previous pledges given by successive Governments.6. I have now received from General Hertzog a letter (Appendix D) in which he repeats the view that the time has come for the Union to take over the Territories, but makes no reference to the points raised in the note handed to General Smuts.7. I have recently had an opportunity of discussing the matter with the High Commissioner for South Africa, Sir Herbert Stanley, who is at present on leave in this country, and I am satisfied from what he tells me that any proposal for the transfer of the Territories would meet with the very strong opposition of the natives. Indeed, any attempt to consult the natives, as we are pledged to do before we could agree to transfer, would give rise to grave misgivings and possibly even disorder, and it may be taken as certain that the result could only be embarrassing both to the Union Government and to ourselves.8. Apart from this aspect of the matter, there is also the consideration that it would be undesirable to hand over the Territories to the Union during the present uncertain state of the Union political position and of Union native policy. It is clear that the cleavage between the present Government in the Union and the extremists of the National party under Dr. Malan is likely to continue. Indeed, General Hertzog himself has predicted a general election next year, and if there is one there is likely to be a more openly Republican party in the field than before. In fact, I am personally somewhat apprehensive that the time may come in the not very distant future when a Government of the Left with Republican ideals will actually come into power in the Union.9. The general attitude of the white people of the Union of South Africa to the native problem is well known and, to say the least, does not induce to -confidence here that we could properly hand over our trusteeship in respect of the Territories. General Hertzog&apos;s previous Government introduced certain Bills relating to Native questions a few years ago which have been the subject of much controversy in the Union, but the formation of the Coalition Government has made it very doubtful when such legislation could be proceeded with or what form it would finally take. It would clearly be unfair to the natives of the Territories even to think of handing them over to the Union while the native policy of the Union is still undetermined.10. In the case of the Bechuanaland Protectorate, the special point arises that Southern Rhodesia has aspirations of becomingthe nucleus of a larger State, embracing Northern Rhodesia arid the northern part of Bechuanaland Protectorate, which would counterbalance the Union with its - strong Dutch influence in the south. Whatever view may be taken as to the desirability or feasibility of this project, it is clear that, if any change in the status quo of the
Bechuanaland Protectorate is proposed, the claims,of Southern Rhodesia to the northern part of&apos; it will have to be considered.; The, Southern Rhodesia Govern-ment have, indeed, formally intimated that Southern Rhodesia is very directly concerned in the future of the Bechuanaland Protectorate, and they were informed in a despatch sent on the 18th March, 1931, that if the question of the transfer of the High Commission Territories to the Union should be raised the interests of Southern Rhodesia would be accorded the fullest consideration.11. I should propose, therefore, to remind General Hertzog, in reply to his letter, of the pledges set out in the memorandum handed to general smuts in July last, which he has no doubt seen, and to say that, in view of those pledges, it would clearly not be possible for His Maje&apos;sty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom even to consider the question of transfer without taking steps to ascertain the opinion of the population, both native and European, on the subject. I should make clear that I have had an opportunity of discussing the whole matter with my colleagues, and that we feel that the present is not a suitable time for raising this question with the native population of the Territories, with a view to the submission of the matter to Parliament here, which, as he will see from the memorandum handed to General Smuts, successive Governments have promised to consult before any decision as to transfer is taken.I should propose to add, as regards General Hertzog&apos;s personal invitation to myself, that it is one which I greatly appreciate and which I should like to accept, if circumstances permitted, but that at the moment the political and intern-national situation is such that I fear that I cannot say with any certainty whether it will be possible for me to get away next year.12. If this policy is approved, I should hope that General Hertzog would accept the decision ungrudgingly, and consequently that we shall be able for the next few years to administer the Territories without constant regard to the possibility of their transfer at an early date. It must be recognised, however, that our position is, in essentials, a weak one, since the economic development of the Territories necessarily depends upon the absence of hindrances by the Union, to which the Territories look for their chief market. I should, of course, make every endeavour to secure that the Union Government would not place further restrictions on the products of the Territories, but it is certain that, in any case, they will require some financial assistance from the Exchequer. Grants-in-aid have in recent years been provided for Swaziland, and during the current year for the Bechuanaland Protectorate. The grant-in-aid for the latter was largely necessitated by an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease, and the difficulties of the Protectorate have been accentuated by the exceptional drought which has been affecting the whole of South Africa; but though these are, it is to be hoped, only temporary misfortunes, I am afraid that a rapid recovery in the economic position of the Protectorate, such as will enable it once again to subsist on its own resources, cannot be expected. Indeed, I think that money is likely to be needed for a policy of reasonable economic development in all three territories in order to justify the continuance of administration under the High Commission to the native and European populations of the territories as well as to public opinion at home.J. H. T.Dominions Office, November 10, 1933.
4 cAPPENDIX A.Note.IN considering any suggestion for transfer of any of the South Africa High Commission Territories to the Union, account must be taken of the following considerations :-(i) Pledges given by or on behalf of successive Secretaries of State to (a) Parliament;(b) the inhabitants of the Territories.(ii) The conditions prescribed in the Schedule to the South Africa Act, 1909. (iii) The wishes of the inhabitants.I. Pledges given by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United ^Kingdom.When the South Africa Bill was before the House of Commons the Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies stated on behalf of His Ma;jesty&apos;s Government that- &quot; the House may rest assured and I have the full authority of the Govern-ment and the Prime Minister for saying so that it will have the fullest opportunity of considering the matter before the transfer of the Protectorates.&quot;At the later stage of the debate he stated :- &quot; The wishes of the natives in these Territories will be most carefully considered before any transfer takes place.&quot;At the same time the former assurance was repeated with an additional statement, that the House &apos;&apos; will have an opportunity of discussing, and, if they wish, of disapproving of the action of the Government.&quot;In November 1919 the following question was asked in the House of Commons : - &quot;Whether His Majesty&apos;s Government are considering any alteration in the status of the Protectorate of Swaziland, Bechuanaland and Basutoland; whether the inhabitants will be consulted before any change in the status does take place, and whether the House of Commons will have an opportunity of debating the matter before any action is taken.&quot;The answer of the Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies was as follows :  &apos;&apos; The answer to the first part of the question is in the negative, and to the second and third parts in the affirmative.&quot;In February 1925 the following question was asked in the House of Commons : &quot; Whether the Secretary of State for the Colonies can give an assurance that no steps will be taken to concur in any way with the incorporation of Bechuanaland or Basutoland or Swaziland in the Union of South Africa before an opportunity has been given to this HoUse to record its opinion on this matter of our responsibility for and to the native races.&quot;To which the Secretary of State made the following reply : &quot;In accordance with the pledges given when the, South Africa Bill was before Parliament, the House will have the fullest opportunity of discussing, and, if they wish, of disapproving, any proposed transfer of these Territories to the Union.&quot;
In the course of a statement in February 1925 in the House of Lords, Lord Onslow stated on behalf of His Majesty V Government that if at any time His Majesty&apos;s Government should be asked to come to any decision in regard to any such transfer,&apos;&apos; they will not make any decision until the native population and the white population have had full opportunity of expressing their views, and any views they, may express, and any representations which either the native population ,.- or the white population may make to His Majesty&apos;s Government will receive, the most careful consideration before the Government come to any final decision in regard to the matter.&quot;Reference may also be made in this connexion to the following statement made by General Hertzog in the Union Parliament on the 25th March, 1925 : &quot; Our position has always been as a party, that we are not prepared to incorporate in the Union any Territory unless the inhabitants of the Territory are prepared to come in.&quot;II. The South A friea A ct, 1909.Section 151 of the Act provides that the King, with the advice of the Privy Council, may on addresses from the Houses of Parliament of the Union, transfer to the Union the government of any of the territories, subject to the terms and conditions embodied in the Schedule.The terms of the Schedule were drawn up by the South Africa National Convention and were accepted by that body and by the Parliament of the United Kingdom as embodying certain principles and safeguards to native rights long recognized as essential.Three important features which may be noted are : (a) The provisions prescribing that no part of the native reserves may bealienated from the native tribes inhabiting the Territories (Section 14);(b) The composition of the Commission charged with the duty of advising the Prime Minister in the administration of the Territories (Section 3);(c) The provisions prohibiting the levying of any differential duties orimposts upon the produce of the Territories (Section 17).The importance of the Schedule as a guarantee that the existing rights of the natives would not be prejudiced in the event of transfer was explained to the Swazi deputation in 1923 by the then Secretary of State. On this occasion the Secretary of State said : &quot;I need hardly say that His Majesty&apos;s Government would not support in the House of Commons or elsewhere any proposal for transfer if it involved the impairment of such safeguards for native rights and interests as the Schedule to the South Africa Act was designed to secure.&quot;Since the South Africa Act was passed, the constitutional position has been affected by the passage of the Statute of Westminster. In view of this Statute the Schedule to the South Africa Act can no longer be regarded as affording in itself a legal safeguard, though it is clear from what is stated above that transfer could only be made subject to agreement that the general scheme of the schedule would be maintained.There are two provisions in the Schedule which require special consideration in this connexion, viz., (i) Section 20 which states that the King may disallow any law made by the Governor-General in Council by Proclamation for any territory, (ii) Section 25 providing that all Bills to amend or alter the provisions of the Schedule shall be reserved for the signification of His Majesty&apos;s pleasure.Before any question of transfer could be considered it would be necessary to ascertain:  * .     . ;.      .. ,. ,-   j , -     ,(a) What1 the Union Government would propose to substitute for the provision relating to the power of disallowance. (This, at the. time when the South Africa Act was passed, meant disallowance on the advice of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom.)   And
(6) What alternative form of security could be provided in place of the provision as regards reservation. (At the time of the South Africa Act His Majesty would have been advised as to the Bills in question by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom.)III. The Wishes of the Inhabitants.In accordance with the pledges referred to above it would be essential to give both the native population and the white population of the Territory or Territories concerned full opportunity of expressing their views with regard to any proposal for transfer, and the question when and how this could be done would require very careful consideration. In this connexion account would have to be taken of the fact that the native policy in the Union is still the subject of discussion and will, it is understood, form the subject of future legislation. The natives of the Territories would naturally require to know how their interests were likely to be affected by any developments of native policy in the Union.July 1933.APPENDIX B.Minister of Justice (Union of South Africa) to Secretary of State forDominion A ffairs. &apos;South A.frica House, 73, Strand, Sir, London, W.C.2, July 28, 1933.WITH reference to your recent conversation with my colleague, Mr. N. C. Havenga, the Minister of Finance of the Union of South Africa, in regard to the proposed transfer of Basutoland, Bechuanaland and Swaziland to the Union, I have the honour to submit to you the annexed memorandum which sets forth the views of the Government of the Union on the matter.I have, &amp;c.J.. C. SMUTS, Minister of Justice (Union of South A fried).Memorandum on the proposed Incorporation of Basutoland, Bechuanaland and Swaziland in the Union of South Africa.Geographically Basutoland, the greater part of Bechuanaland, and Swaziland (hereinafter referred to collectively as the Territories) belong to the territory which constitutes the Union of South Africa, and ethnologically and racially the inhabitants of the Territories are indistinguishable from the inhabitants of the Union. In fact, in several instances members of the same tribes are settled on either side of the present political boundaries separating&quot; the Territories from the Union.Historically also, two of the Territories belong to the Union. Basutoland was formerly part of the Cape Colony, and Swaziland was a protectorate of the Transvaal, and the line of demarcation between that part of Bechuanaland which forms part of the Cape Province on the one hand and the Bechuanaland Protectorate on the other, was quite arbitrarily chosen. It was merely a matter of convenience that it was not placed a few hundred miles further to the north.But the strongest ties of all between the Territories and the Union are the economic bonds which bind them inseparably together and make the Territories entirely dependent upon the Union.The Territories have practically no other market than the Union for all their products and particularly for their vast labour supplies. These labour supplies are of vital importance to the Territories, especially Basutoland, which could not possibly maintain its population without the wages earned by its labourers on the mines and elsewhere in the Union. Most of the banking and other business in the Territories is- controlled from the Union, and the Territories and the Union are already being dealt with as one entity for purposes of customs and excise because it is not feasible to deal with each Territory as a separate entity.
And yet, in spite of the fact that the Territories belong to the Union geographically,- racially, historically and economically, they are separated therefrom by purely artificial boundaries,This separation has many disadvantages. Although Bechuanaland and Swaziland are treated as part of the Union for customs purposes, yet the Union Government can exercise no control over the administration of the customs laws in those Territories a most anomalous state of affairs. Furthermore, as there are practically no immigration restrictions between the Territories and the Union, it is very difficult for the Union to prevent the influx of prohibited immigrants from abroad through Swaziland or Bechuanaland.As regards Basutoland, it is desirable in the interest of the Union, as well as of Basutoland itself, that steps be taken on an extensive scale along the head-waters of several important rivers which arise in Basutoland and flow through the Union, to prevent, by means of afforestation and other methods, the erosion which is causing so much damage in the mountainous parts of the country. These steps might have to be taken on both sides of the border and could be carried out satisfactorily only by the Union Government.The Union is vitally interested in the control of animal diseases in the Territories, and yet it cannot itself exercise any such control. With its extensive veterinary organization and greater resources, the Union can far better prevent or check the spread of animal diseases in the Territories and from there to the Union than the present Administrations of the Territories can do.The illicit traffic in firearms and ammunition, the illicit removal of stock from quarantine areas, and many other offences committed along the borders between the Union and the Territories are facilitated by the political separation of the areas in question and could be much better controlled by one police force subject to one authority.And lastly, as the natives in the Territories belong to the same stock as the natives in the Union and often form part of the same tribes, and as they all have similar interests it is essential that the native policy in the Union as well as in the Territories be laid down and controlled by one Government.The anomaly and inconvenience of separating the Territories from the area which now constitutes the Union was fully realised as far back as twenty-five years ago, when the House of Commons passed a resolution expressing its confidence &quot; that His Majesty&apos;s Government will welcome the adoption of provisions calculated to render possible the ultimate inclusion of the whole of British South Africa in a federal union.&quot;This resolution was acted upon by the framers of the South Africa Act, 1909, for therein provision was made not only for the immediate unification of the four self-governing South Africa Colonies, and for the ultimate inclusion of Rhodesia in the Union, but also (in Section 151) for the eventual transfer of the Territories to the Union.In dealing with this section when the Bill in question was before the House of Lords, the Secretary of State for the Colonies (the Earl of Crewe) correctly expressed the general feeling in regard to the matter when he stated that &apos;&apos; it does not seem conceivable that for an indefinite future these areas should remain administered from here (i.e., from London) and that the new South African Union should have no lot or part in their administration.&quot;Neither Section 151 nor any other part of the South Africa Act gives any clear indication of the time when the Territories should be transferred to the Union, but the Legislature obviously contemplated an early transfer. Otherwise no provision would have been made in 1909, in the Schedule to the Act, for a very special form of government of the Territories to be transferred, as it could well be foreseen that after effluction of a considerable period the social, cultural and economic conditions of those Territories might be so different from what they were when the Act was passed that the form of government laid down in the Schedule would&apos; be impracticable. This view is borne out by the attitude of the Secretary of State for the Colonies during the passage of the South Africa Bill. The Bill was first passed by the House of Lords, and at the committee stage Lord Courtney of Penwith moved an amendment to Clause 151, providing that a transfer of the Territories could only be effected &quot; at the expiration of ten years from the establishment of the Union.&quot; In opposing this motion, the Secretary of State for the Colonies, the Earl of Crewe, stated that he had no reason to suppose indeed, quite the contrary that the existing South African Govern-
ments would agree to the ten years&apos; limit proposed by the noble Lord, and that he thought they would raise the strongest objection to the insertion of any such provision. He said further : &quot; From our own point of view we also object to it. ,;, If you say that no handing over shall take place for ten years, there is some case against the insertion of the Schedule at all. It might be argued, and would, I think, be argued, that if at any rate for ten years, and possibly longer, no transfer could take place, it is somewhat premature to enter into the terms of transfer&apos;as we have done in the Schedule.&quot;A similar amendment to that moved by Lord Courtney was later urged in the House of Commons by Mr. Keir Hardie, and this was also turned down by Colonel Seely (Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies), who was in charge of the Bill In that House.b&apos;*It is therefore clear that those responsible for the passage of the South Africa Act anticipated that the Territories would be transferred to the Union within a comparatively short period.And now after a lapse of more than two decades the Government and the people of the Union feel that the transfer is long overdue.The Union producers resent the competition in their own markets of Bechuanaland or Swaziland livestock and dairy products, of Swaziland tobacco and maize, and of Basutoland wheat (which are, moreover, brought on, to those markets by means of Union railways and motor transport at special, unremunera-tive rates), and have brought pressure to bear upon the Union Government to bar those products from Union markets in view of the fact that they come from Territories which are politically as distinct from the Union as if they were situate in a different continent. Moreover, many able-bodied Union natives now cannot find employment, so that they cannot maintain themselves and their dependants and require State assistance; and yet a large number of natives from the Territories are employed in the Union, thus ousting Union natives. If the borders of the Union were closed to native labourers from outside, there would be no unemployment among Union natives and the State would not be burdened with the cost of native unemployment relief.There can be no doubt that the Union bears the brunt of the economic maintenance of the Territories, and it is felt that, if the Territories are to be maintained by the Union and to form part of the Union economically, they must also form part of it politically. The Union may find it difficult to continue the economic maintenance of the Territories, to its own advantage, unless they form part and parcel of the Union. If they are to remain politically separate, the Union Government may find it very difficult to resist the pressure brought to bear upon it to prevent their products from competing with Union products in Union markets.APPENDIX C.Mr. J. H. Thomas (Dominions Office) to General J. C. Smuts (Minister of Justice,Union of South Africa).My dear Smuts, Downing Street, August 4, 1933.I HAVE now had an opportunity to read the memorandum which you sent to rne in your letter of the 28th July in regard to the question of transfer of the High Commission Territories to the Union.I note that the memorandum deals with the matter mainly from the point of view of the administrative and economic advantage of transfer, and does not touch upon the points raised in the note which I handed to you at our discussion on the 21st July.   No doubt you will be having these points further examined.In this connexion I should call your attention to the statement made by Lord Strathcona, oh behalf of the Government, in the debate in the House of Lords on the 26th July see column 1127 in the enclosed Hansard report -and also to the passages in the debate in the House of Commons on the following day, which you will find in columns 2816-7, 2858, and 2868 of the accompanying Hansard report.Yours sincerely,V J. II.  THOMAS.
r, . -i&apos;   - Enclosure 1. .1   -  -       ).Lord Strathcona and Mount Royal : My Lords, I can only speak again by leave of the House, but as the.noble Earl has referred to the question of transfer I think I ought to say that the question has been raised, as the noble Earl hars said. This.is ;a contingency which is-provided for in the. South Africa Act. of 1909, Section 151 of which provides that the King, with the advice of the Privy Council, may, on Addresses from the Union Parliament, transfer. such territory to the Union Government, and that upon transfer the Government is to be carried on in accordance with the terms of the Schedule to the Act. In view of this provision the possibility of the transfer of the High Commission Territories has naturally come up for discussion from time tq time with the Union Government. Consideration of this question must be governed by certain pledges which have been given by successive Governments in the past and to which the present Government fully adhere.In the first place, there is the pledge given in the course of the debate on the South Africa Bill that Parliament would be given an opportunity of discussing and, if they wished, of disapproving any proposal for transfer. Secondly, there is the pledge, which was repeated in this House in 1925, when the matter was last discussed here, that if His Majesty&apos;s Government should be asked to come to any decision in regard to any such transfer they will not make any decision until the native population and the white population have had a full opportunity of expressing their views. Thirdly, there is the assurance which has in the past been given to the natives, that His Majesty&apos;s Government would not support any proposal of transfer if it involved any impairment of such safeguards for native rights and interests, as the Schedule of the South Africa Act was designed to secure. I am aware that apprehensions have been expressed from time to time by the native communities in the territories on this subject, but the assurances to which I have referred are quite definite, and the noble Earl, I think, can rest assured that they are fully present to the mind of the Government.Enclosure 2.-7t* &quot;Tr *a- TV&quot; &quot;Tv-Mr. Lunn : .... I want to mention another matter which is hardly a question of a self-governing dominion, but which comes under the Dominions Office. It is the position and the future of the three African Protectorates which are under the Dominions Office. It is important that we should know the attitude of the Dominions Office towards these three important and very extensive parts of the African Empire. The right hon. Gentleman will remember that in 1930 he took what I think was a very wise step. He separated the position of Governor-General from that of the High Commissioner, and he appointed a High Commissioner for these areas. I agreed with it, and agree with it to-day, and hope that it will continue, but I should like to see the High Commissioner have more power in his office than, I understand, he possesses at the present time. In 1930 a charter of liberty for the millions of natives was laid down by the Labour Government. That charter differs a great deal from the policy towards the natives of the Government of the Union of South Africa. We wish for them to remain under the direct rule of the Dominions Office, which, I understand, is the policy of the Government, rather than that they should be included in the Union of South Africa. We should regard the introduction of South African native policy into the Protectorates as disastrous. To hand them over to the Union of South Africa would be a great breach of faith. The other day I saw a book by Mrs. Hodgson and Mr. Ballinger, who have done very useful work in these Protectorates.  This is one of the statements which they made upon this; matter : &quot; The natives of the Protectorate are now as opposed - to absorption by the Union of South Africa as they were 30 years ago to absorption by Rhodesia. They cling now as then to the Imperial connexion. To the native of Bechuanaland the transference of the Protectorate to the Union means the.
compromising of the whole of his future, the loss of all his hopes of remaining a free, man, and of becoming a ^civilized&apos; one. He clings to the liberal tradition of Britain, as he dreads the illiberal tradition of South Africa.&quot;J3ut&quot;tbese Protectorates cannot remain as they are to-day. They are poor. They are depressed. They are a reservoir of cheap labour for the mines in the Union. What steps is the right hon. Gentleman taking to implement parts of the report of Sir Allen Pirn, whom we sent out to Bechuanaland to make a report, and whose report is now in his hands? Is he going to support organized recruiting, improved educational facilities, increased agricultural instruction and implement water schemes as is suggested in the report of Sir Allen Pirn&apos;? Is the right hon. Gentleman also going to give more power to the High Commissioner to develop .and&apos;ope&apos;n up new territories for cattle raising ?&apos;     &apos; * -n&apos; - *      . * - . ..*. .     * *Mr. Lunn : If the right hon. Gentleman is able to tell me that the High Commissioner has full and complete powers in the matters I have mentioned I shall accept the statement. That is the position I want because I am a supporter of the idea of the High Commissioner, and I know that we have a good man there, and I would like to see him take steps so that the report of Sir Allen Pirn could be put into actual operation.*fr *a&quot; &quot;fi&quot; -Jt&quot; -7?Mr. David Grenfell : .... I desire also to refer to the increasingly difficult plight of the natives in the native protectorates in South Africa. These people are living a simple life in their own country under very primitive pastoral conditions. They are enjoying but a very bare measure of subsistence, and there is ground for believing that their condition is getting seriously worse. Pasture is getting scarcer, and water supplies have run dry, while cattle disease and a number of other troubles beset the natives in the Protectorates of Somaliland, Swaziland, and Basutoland. We are anxious that the Dominions Secretary should see that whatever assistance can be given in .the form, of grants-in-aid to these people shall be forthcoming, and that, in addition, there shall be an assurance as to their position in relation to the Crown and to His Majesty&apos;s Government that there shall be no transference of responsibility from the Government until these people have been consulted, and until the white population and the right hon. Gentleman&apos;s Department have been consulted.****** Mr. Thomas : .... There is only one other question which I have to answer. With regard to Bechuanaland and the Protectorates generally, I have to indicate on behalf of the Government that the clear and specific pledges made not only by one Government but by many Governments will be kept in mind as far as the present Government are concerned.APPENDIX D.Prime Minister&apos;.$ Office, My Dear Thomas, Pretoria, October 1, 1933.I AM very glad to hear from Smuts and Havenga that during their stay in London they have had an opportunity of discussing with you the question of the transfer of the native territories : Basutoland, Swaziland and the bechuanaland-land Protectorate; and of submitting to you a short memo, on the subject, which might be laid before your colleagues in the Cabinet.The cession of these Territories to the Union has, as you know, ever since 1910 been looked upon, not only as finally decided upon, but also as one the actual performance of which could be expected within a comparatively near future. Hence the Schedule to the South Africa Act making provision for the transfer of the territories and their Government by the Union.
oAlready for some years now, the question of transfer has been more and more engaging the attention of the people of this country, and to-day, owing more particularly to economic considerations in connection with Union markets and questions of stock-disease, it is very generally felt that the time has come for the Union to assume responsibility in connection with these Territories and to take , them over. ,,     . , ,  , *I hope, therefore, that you have had time to give the matter your further consideration, and that, you and your colleagues may find it possible to assist&apos; in bringing the matter to an early conclusion. It would, 1 feel sure, be very helpful if you could come out, and enquire into matters on the spot, many a difficulty would disappear when looked at in the light of South Africa and circumstances here.I know how busy you are; but perhaps for that reason it may be all the &apos;&apos; more necessary that you pay South Africa a visit, combining health with business&apos;&apos; I need hardly assure you that you and Mrs. Thomas will be very welcome.. We shall take good care of you.   If I may make a suggestion as to time, I would say February to June. .   ;;     :Yours very sincerely,J. B. M. HERTZOG. Tit. Hon. J. H. Thomas, M.P. .
