this document is the property of his britannic majestvs governmentPrinted for the Cabinet.   November 1933.SECRET. &apos; Copy No.   49CP. 255 (33).CABINET.DISARMAMENT.IN accordance with the conclusion reached at the last meeting of the Cabinet, I circulate herewith the draft plan for a modified disarmament convention which has been worked out in the Foreign Office.J. S.November 3, 1933.Draft Plan.THE following Draft Plan of a disarmament compromise has been drawn up as an attempt to get over certain formidable difficulties in the way of the conclusion of a Disarmament Convention. Chief among these are Germany&apos;s objections to the idea of a so-called probationary period as suggested though not under that name -in the report of the 14th October, and to what she alleges to be a denial to her of complete equality of rights. Whatever the justification or lack of justification for Germany&apos;s attitude, the fact remains that there is no reason to believe that she will sign any Disarmament Convention unless her objections are met. The intentions of this Draft Plan are to meet those objections of Germany without affecting deleteriously the safety of this country, France, and other States. For instance, the probationary period disappears. Germany is assured of a complete qualitative equality by the end of the Convention. At the same time this is arranged by such a system of stages as will in fact leave France and ourselves a very large margin of superiority in regard to tanks, land mobile guns and military aircraft right up to the end of the life of the Convention. If what Herr Hitler said (see Sir Eric Phipps&apos;s telegram No. 232 and despatch No. 1017) can be relied on and due account has been taken of it in this Draft Plan Germany&apos;s legitimate claims are met in the plan. She is allowed an unlimited number of anti-aircraft guns and indisputably defensive weapons (i.e., those allowed by the Treaty of Versailles), while her acquisition of more powerful weapons is delayed and equality is eventually reached rather through the destruction of the most powerful weapons by others than by Germany&apos;s acquisition of them.It is only on some such new lines as these that it seems possible to contemplate a Disarmament Convention to which Germany will ever be a party. On the other hand, great care has been taken to suggest nothing that would in any sense prejudice the position of France. In the first place the Convention will be of eight, not five, years&apos; duration, so that the actual achievement of full equality between France and Germany is delayed three years longer than was contemplated in the British Draft Convention. France and other countries do, indeed, at the end of the second year destroy their heaviest land and air material, but throughout the six remaining years of the life of the Convention, France and, indeed, ourselves retain an overwhelming though decreasing superiority in heavy material over Germany. The Italian Government,, so far as is known, would be unlikely to dissent from the proposals of the draft ;scheme.An endeavour has been made in the plan to put in the forefront the suggestions made by Lord Hailsham in. Cabinet on the 23rd October in regard to the scrapping of the heaviest weapons as the first step.A glance at the table attached shows how closely the Draft Plan adheres to the proposals of the United Kingdom Draft Convention.1. Effectives.France to state the number of men with the colours annually during the duration of the Convention.Germany to have equal numbers with France&apos;s metropolitan numbers and France to have 200,000 overseas.   The German eight-months militia thus7087a   [9223]

Material.Tanks. By the end of the second year all countries to destroy tanks above 30 tons, and in future to build none above this weight. All countries during the period of the Convention to reduce their total tonnage of tanks to agreed figures so that at the end of the eight years France, e.g., would possess      tons instead oftons and the United Kingdom tons instead of tons. Germany would voluntarily undertake either to build no tanks during the period or to build only tons of tanks, by agreed stages.Land mobile guns. All countries would destroy their land mobile guns above 350 mm. by the end of 2 years; between 350 and 220 mm. by the end of 4 years, and above 155 mm. by the end of 6 years. Germany would undertake not to build guns above 105 mm. for the first two years, and thereafter not above 155 mm. If no agreement had been reached by that time as to numbers of these guns all countries would be unrestricted..&apos;\&quot; Military aircraft. -All countries would reduce the unladen weight of their military aircraft to 3 tons by the end of two years. Germany would undertake to build no military aircraft for two years pending the full discussion in the Permanent Disarmament Commission under article 35 of the United Kingdom draft Convention of the abolition of military aircraft. If at the end of two years the Permanent Disarmament Commission have not decided on the abolition of military aircraft, then Germany would proceed to acquire 100 military aircraft a year up to 500, so that by the end of eight years the other Powers reducing by stages--all great Powers would possess no more than 500 aircraft in Europe, an allowance (not more than 250 unless the principal non-European Powers refused to come into the Convention) being made for countries with overseas possessions to possess certain additional military aircraft stationed exclusively therein.If there is unanimity among the European Powers, total prohibition of aerial bombardment should come into force at once as between them, the same prohibition being;extended reciprocally to other parts of the world between all signatories of the. Disarmament Convention.7  3. - Convention to be of eight years&apos; duration..4, If agreement is reached on the above matters a system of periodic super-vision, applying generally, to be worked out in detail.Table of Differences between the Draft Plan and the British Draft Convention.Draft Plan.Effectives.-Germany to have a number of effectives equal to that of the French metropolitan army.
