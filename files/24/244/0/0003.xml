this document is the property of his britannic majesty&apos;s governmentSECRET. .-,,-! bli,w n Copy No.CP. 253 (33)CABINET.DISARMAMENT.THE Cabinet will wish for a brief report of disarmament developments during the past week.1. As regards Geneva, the decision is that the General Commission re-assembles on the 4th December and that the Bureau endeavours to prepare the ground by meeting on the 9th November. It is very difficult to see what the Bureau can effectively do on that date, but the arrangement will at least bring together in the same place the representatives of many Powers. Italy will send a representative to the Bureau, but has intimated that in her view work at Geneva should not be hurried &quot;and had better be put off till January (see Sir R. Graham&apos;s telegram No. 303 recording conversation with Signor Mussolini on the 21st October). The new French Government is busy with its own programme and financial problem, but outw*ardly professes a desire for the Conference to go on without delay. Mr. Norman Davis has informed us that he hopes to be in Geneva and take part when the General Commission meets on the 4th December, but in the meantime he is returning to America to consult his Government. The United Kingdom Government has done its utmost to avoid the reproach that it is party to unnecessary postponement, and we have told Mr. Henderson that we acquiesce in the arrangements which are necessary in order to meet the views of other Powers.2. As regards the communications with the other principal Governments, Lord Tyrrell was instructed to invite the French Government to reply to certain questions designed to elicit their general attitude (telegram No. 211). The French Government have answered partly through Lord Tyrrell (see his telegram No. 260: Saving) and through the French Ambassador (see my despatch to Paris No. 1718), but their reply does not clear up completely all the questions on which we desire information. As regards Italy, after receiving Sir R. Graham&apos;s telegram No. 303, we at once sent a message (my telegram No. 340) assuring Signor Mussolini of His Majesty&apos;s Governments appreciation of his attitude and desire to keep in close touch with him. We have further maintained the closest touch with Mr. Norman Davis at Geneva. As regards Germany, Sir E. Phipps was instructed (see my telegram No. 199 of the 23rd October), when seeing the Chancellor on the following day, to express the hope that the German Government would help to promote neighbourly relations on the continent of Europe, by avoiding taking up a rigid attitude.3. We thus have a short breathing space, though the impending House of Commons debate on the 7th November and the declaration of policy to be made by the Prime Minister at the Guildhall Banquet on the 9th November show that there is no time to lose in sorting out our ideas.The following propositions may be advanced for the consideration of my colleagues : (a) The governing principle of our policy is and must be that the work for international disarmament must go on in the most effective way.(b) Discussions at Geneva, carried on through the regular organs of theDisarmament Conference wall certainly go on. Side by side with the efforts which we are making to promote agreement outside the7087   [9222] -

It would be quite impossible for the British/Govern^ ment to take up the attitude that Germany&apos;s withdrawal has finally smashed the conference.(c) We must not overlook the possibility that Mr. Henderson himself will produce what he calls &quot; a clean draft &quot; on the 9th November or later, which might be expected to include articles defining the aggressor, generalising the no-resort-to-force declaration, and even formulating penalties for infraction of the Convention as well as modifications in the British Draft on the lines of the report made to the Bureau on the 14th October.(d) There are great objections to formulating an amended Convention whichmerely incorporates the modifications suggested in the Bureau on the 14th October.  Germany has now publicly repudiated these proposals. .;;  . It seems, therefore, to be a foregone conclusion that, even if theseproposals could be fitted into a final draft and agreed by 84 nations out of 65, Germany would reject them. There is no advantage in this. We know that the Italians do not favour such a course, and, indeed, were rather critical of some of the proposed modifi-cations. If an offer is elaborately formulated between the Powers at Geneva merely in order that Germany may reject it, the question will at once arise (and will be pressed by the French) : What are we going to do to bring Germany to reason ?(e) What is wanted therefore is a new mode of approach which will giveGermany the opportunity Of agreeing without completely stultifying her public declarations. After the German elections Hitler may be in a more accommodating mood. We should aim at a variation in the previous proposals which would meet as far as possible the German objections to (1) a so-called trial period, and (2) an alleged denial of ; equality.   Since Germany has accepted the principles of the British draft and the proposition of reaching a conclusion by stages, this should not be impossible. If, on the other hand, we persist in pressing for the letter of the proposals put before the Bureau on the 14th October, Germany will not only repeat her refusal to agree, but . --......    will protest that we are making no real effort to meet her objections.j 4. If the above propositions are approved, the practical question urgently arises as to the possible lines of modification. The outline of a plan has been worked out in the Foreign Office during the last two or three days and can be circulated. If something on these lines commended itself, it would be necessary to approach the French Government privately (when we may expect, at first, a. good deal of objection) and very soon afterwards to approach the Italian (government (which may be expected to communicate the line of the suggestions to, the Germans). Mr. Eden and I calculate that the Italians might approve the. new proposal. The French would not altogether like it, but would prefer it: presumably to no convention at all. What the Germans would do we cannot calculate, and, indeed, appears to be quite incalculable, in view of the remarkable description given of the German Chancellors attitude and mentality in Sir Eric Phipps&apos;s despatch of the 24th October...... J. S.Foreign Office, November 1, 1933.
