A. ruling by the Cabinet is urgently required as to whether His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom will be prepared to make a contribution, and, if so, of how much, towards the resettlement outside Iraq of those Assyrians who may wish to leave that country.J. S.November 14, 1933.THE ASSYRIAN QUESTION.A DECISION of principle is now urgently required on the question whether His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom would be prepared in certain specified circumstances to make a financial contribution towards the resettlement outside Iraq of those Assyrians who wish to leave that country.2. The Committee set up by the decision of the Council of the League of Nations on the 14th October, 1933, has considered several countries as possible destinations for the Assyrians, and the League Secretariat, in conjunction with the Nansen Office, is still making enquiries as to possibilities. Meanwhile, settlement in Brazil is the only promising solution before the Committee for which anything like a detailed plan at present exists. The main drawback to this solution is its cost; but the only other country considered by the Committee where settlement would be likely to be less expensive and which has not already been ruled out on one ground or another is Abyssinia, and it is doubtful whether conditions in that country are such as to justify the League in settling the Assyrians there except under guarantees which the Abyssinian Government might be unwilling to furnish or which might in any case prove unsatisfactory.3. As regards Brazil, the proposal is to settle the Assyrians in the province of Parana, under the auspices of a British company, Parana Plantations, Ltd. This company, whose chairman is Brigadier-General the Honourable Arthur Asquith, D.S.O., possesses practically the entire capital of three Brazilian companies which have at their disposal some 3 million acres of land. A number of colonists, mostly Russian, German and Japanese, have already been settled on this land, and Parana Plantations, Ltd., are building a railway through it. The company is not primarily a colonisation company, but has an interest in developing the area in order to make the railway pay. The territory is for the most part virgin forest, but the soil and climate are reported on reliable authority to be extremely good.   The height varies between about 1,300 and 2,800 feet.4.   As regards cost, it has not yet been possible to work out precise figures. The precise number of Assyrians to be resettled cannot be fixed until the Assyrians can be informed of the destination to which it is proposed to send. 7102   [9275] b
them and their wishes ascertained: Nor is it possible to obtain final figures, from the commercial concerns involved until concrete proposals can be put before them. But it seems clear that the cost will be not less than  125 per family of 5 persons, while the maximum estimate is as much as  175 a family. The maximum figure includes transport from Beirut to the area concerned in Brazil, the purchase of 30 acres of land per family, the clearing of 3 acres for each, family, the building of a small house, the provision of tools, seed and live-stock and maintenance for the first nine months after establishment. The minimum figure is based on the hope that it may be possible to reduce the cost of transport, and does not include any provision for maintenance after establishment.5. The total number of Assyrians in Iraq (excluding those of Persian origin, whose future is at present uncertain) is believed to be about 20,000 (i.e., 4,000 families of an average of 5 persons). Some of these will for various reasons not wish to leave Iraq. The Council Committee is working on the assumption that a minimum of 10,000 (2,000 families) will wish to leave. It is probably safe to estimate that not more than 15,000 (3,000 families) will eventually go. Thus, the cost will amount to anything between  250,000 if 10,000 people go on the minimum estimate, and  700,000 if 20,000 people go at the maximum rate; and if 15,000 people go, the cost will vary between  375,000 and  525,000.6. The Council Committee is at present waiting to hear whether the Brazilian Government are prepared in principle to receive a mass immigration of Assyrians from Iraq. If they are, the Committee may still consider a short further delay necessary in order to make sure that no better and cheaper solution can be found elsewhere, preferably nearer to Iraq. On the other hand, it will be influenced by the consideration that a decision is required as soon as possible in order to ease the situation in Iraq.7. In any case, before deciding on Brazil, the Committee is anxious to arrange for an independent investigation into the suitability, for the settlement of the Assyrians, of the area proposed. The present view of the majority of the Committee, however, is that, once the consent of the Brazilian Government has been obtained in principle, the financial practicability of the scheme must be assured before any further steps are taken. In any case, financial assistance will certainly be required whatever scheme of settlement is decided on, so that there is no reason why the question of finance and that of destination should not be -considered pari passu.8. It is possible that some of the Assyrians will be able at the outset to purchase the land allotted to them in Brazil, and to pay for the cost of their own transport. Others, again, may be able to pay a part of the cost of settlement at the outset. It is difficult to estimate at this stage, however, what portion of the total outlay can be written off in this way or regarded as a loan, .and it will be safer to assume that the whole capital outlay must be found by the League, though the Assyrians will in any case be expected to repay by instalments the greater part of the money thus spent on them. On the basis of their previous experience, the Nansen Office expect to recover as much as 75 per cent, of the original outlay, but this reimbursement is likely to be spread over a number of years. Meanwhile, on the almost certainly correct assumption that the whole capital outlay has to be provided by the League, it is for consideration how the sum is to be raised.9. The Iraqi representative on the Council when the Assyrian question was --discussed on the 14th October last stated that the Iraqi Government were prepared to make as generous a contribution as their resources permitted in order to help the Assyrians on their way. Information which is at present confidential exists to the effect that Nuri Pasha, the Iraqi Minister for Poreign Affairs, when .at Geneva, recommended his Government to make an offer of  100,000. The Council Committee was at that time working on the assumption that a minimum of 10,000 Assyrians would wish to move, and that the cost would be only  100 a family, i.e.,  200,000 in all. It is uncertain, therefore, whether Nuri Pasha&apos;s suggestion was that  100,000 should be a fixed maximum, or whether he contem-plated that the Iraqi Government should contribute 50 per cent, of the total cost, with  100,000 as a minimum.
10. It is unlikely that it will be possible, in spite of all our efforts, to persuade the Iraqi Government to contribute more than 50 per cent, of the total cost, if as much. It is reasonable that they should be made to pay as heavily as possible, seeing that it was the massacres of last August (for which the Iraqi army was responsible) which made it finally impossible for the Assyrians as a body to remain in Iraq. Moreover, the Iraqi Government would benefit con-siderably by the removal of the discontented Assyrians and by the final, liquidation of the Assyrian problem. On the other hand, it will certainly be impracticable to get the Iraqi Government to pay the whole cost. The Assyrians in their view have been thrust upon them by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom, and the massacres of last August were only the culminating point of a very difficult and dangerous situation, for which the Assyrians themselves must bear at least half the blame. A further point is that the total Iraqi budget amounted last year to only  3,765,000, so that a contribution of between  100,000 and  200,000 would be relatively large. At the same time-Iraq has at present no national debt, and has unimpaired credit and considerable financial resources.11. In these circumstances it is clear that, over and above the Iraqi contri-bution, a considerable sum will have to be found, and it is most unlikely that it will be forthcoming unless His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom themselves provide it, or, by offering to contribute a proportion, give a strong lead to other members of the League and to private charitable organisations to make up the difference.12. There is a strong feeling abroad, and also in certain circles in this country, that responsibility for the present plight of the Assyrians lies with His Majesty&quot;s Government. The question of the responsibility of His Majesty&apos;s Government is examined in a separate memorandum, of which a copy is attached hereto. That memorandum shows that His Majesty&apos;s Government are under no legal obligation or responsibility, and that the responsibility for the present plight of the Assyrians, if it can be definitely placed anywhere, lies with the League Council as a whole by reason of the Council&apos;s decision on the Mosul boundary in 1925, which left to Turkey the pre-war Assyrian home-lands. Never-theless, it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to explain away His Majesty&apos;s Government^ responsibility in a manner which will carry general conviction, more particularly in view of the statement made before the Permanent Mandates Commission in 1931 regarding the &quot;moral responsibility&quot; of His Majesty&apos;s Government in connexion with the termination of the Mandate in Iraq. More-over, His Majesty&apos;s Government can scarcely wash their hands of the question of Assyrian settlement when so many of the Assyrians have served and are still serving in the levies as a British force or in close association with the British forces in Iraq.13. There is no doubt that, however unjustly, the recent Assyrian troubles in Iraq have severely damaged the credit of His Majesty&apos;s Government, and there is reason to fear that this credit will be still further damaged if His Majesty&apos;s Government offer no practical assistance in the matter of re-settling the Assyrians outside Iraq, and if, through lack of such assistance, re-settlement breaks down altogether or is accomplished in an unsatisfactory manner. In either case the consequences might be dangerous and involve even heavier expenditure later on. Enquiries which have been made show that there is apparently no suitable land available for Assyrian settlement in the Colonial Empire and that it is impossible to approach the Dominions in the matter, and it may indeed be better on political grounds that the Assyrians should be settled outside the Empire. But the fact that they cannot be settled within it strengthens the case for a financial contribution by His Majesty&apos;s Government. All that is required at the moment, however, is a decision in principle by His Majesty&apos;s Government to contribute a percentage of the amount required, over and above the Iraqi contribution, up to-a specified maximum, to finance the Brazilian solution should that be found physically practicable or, failing that solution, the next best which can be found. It is submitted that a fair contribution would be 30 per cent., with a maximum of  200,000. Without such a decision of principle it is difficult to proceed further. If there is no chance of a contribution from His Majesty ^Government, however, it will be difficult for the United Kingdom representative on the [9275] b 2
Annex.]E 56S3/7/93]The Responsibility of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom for theFuture of the Assyrians.THERE appears to be a consensus of opinion that the only satisfactory ^solution of the problem of the Assyrians is the settlement of the whole community or the bulk of it in some country other than Iraq. When this solution comes to be discussed it will no doubt be suggested both at Geneva and in pro-Assyrian circles in this country that His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom should -contribute substantially, by providing either funds or land, to a settlement scheme, because of the alleged special obligations of His Majesty&apos;s Government towards the Assyrians.2. It becomes necessary, therefore, to establish as exactly as possible the nature of these obligations, if any.3. There is a widespread belief that the Assyrians were induced by the Allies and by Great Britain, in particular, to enter the war against Turkey, and that, during the war, they were promised by Great Britain eventual independence, or at least autonomy and protection.-4. A careful search has several times been made into archives of the Foreign Office and also into those of the War Office, without revealing any specific pledge by His Majesty&apos;s Government to the Assyrians.5. It is clear, however, that the Assyrians themselves derived from certain events at the end of 1917 the impression that they might expect British support in realising their national aspirations.6. Great Britain had, at all events, no part in the entry of the Assyrians into the war. This was due solely to Russian instigation. The Assyrians before the war lived in Turkish and Persian Kurdistan. Owing to the paramount influence of Russia in North-West Persia and to the relations between the Nestorian and Orthodox Churches they found themselves, at the outbreak of war, -suspect in Turkey and identified with the Allied cause. In the spring of 1915 Russian troops advancing towards Julamerk got into touch with the Ottoman Assyrians and urged them to rise against the Turks. Russian support was promised, and an assembly of Assyrian notables which met at Diz issued a formal declaration of war against Turkey on the 10th May, 1915. When, shortly after-wards, the Russians retired, the position of the Assyrians became untenable, and they were forced to withdraw with their families to Persian territory after hard fighting. On reaching Persia they continued to assist the Russians until the break-up of the Tsarist armies in 1917. This break-up made the Allies anxious about the Caucasian front, and an attempt was made to induce the Kurds, Armenians and Assyrians to act in some sort of unity with the idea of preventing a Turkish advance through Persia towards India. Assyrians and Armenians were trained by Russian instructors at Urumia, where a French military mission established itself. On the British side, Captain G. F. Gracey was sent on a mission to Urumia towards the end of December 1917 to make friendly approaches-Committee to press for further detailed investigation of the Brazilian scheme, more especially as the next step would probably have to be to institute special enquiries on the spot at some expense. On the other hand, there seems no reason why His Majesty&apos;s Government^ decision should not be made conditional upon their being satisfied by special investigation that the scheme on which their contribution is to be spent is a good one, and upon their being satisfied also that the rest of the money required will be forthcoming.14. The Treasury have been consulted unofficially and expressed the view, which I share, that the matter must be referred to Cabinet before the project is -carried any further.J. S.November 14, 1933.
-r-5to the Kurdish tribes under Sirnko, and to try to heal the breach between, two rival Assyrian leaders, namely, Agha Petros and the Mar Shimun (the predecessor of the present Patriarch). According to an Assyrian account of Captain Gracey&apos;s proceedings, taken from a report prepared by the Assyrian Refugees Committee at Tehran towards the end of 1918, Captain G-racey, at a meeting with the Assyrian leaders at which Russian and French representatives were also present, promised the Assyrians British military support and promised that the Allies, if victorious, would grant to the Assyrians &apos;&apos; permanent and fundamental protection with all the privileges promised to small and oppressed peoples.&quot;7. Last year, in answer to a request from the Foreign Office for his version of what happened, Captain Gracey wrote a confidential letter to Mr. Gaselee. in which he denied having made the pledge attributed to him, and pointed out that it was not within his province as a junior officer to do so. His own version is that he stated that the future of the Assyrians lay in the success of the Allied cause, and that he would use all his personal influence and support in helping them to attain their ideal. He was not in a position to guarantee any action by the British Government to ensure the independence of the Assyrians, but he felt sure that the Allied Governments would consider sympathetically such repre-sentations as the Assyrians might make along these lines. .   &quot;.8. Although Captain Gracey obviously had no power to commit, and his statement did not commit His Majesty&apos;s Government, a simple people like the Assyrians would naturally regard him as an accredited British representative, and may, perhaps, be pardoned for interpreting what he said as a pledge, even though cautious, of British support.9. Moreover, although no specific pledges appear to have been given at any time by His Majesty&apos;s Government, it is evident from official statements that His Majesty&apos;s Government did regard themselves after the war as under some special obligation towards the Assyrians; and the existence of these statements which are recorded below makes it less important to give further detailed consideration to the implications of what Captain Gracey said at Urumia.10. It will be remembered that the Assyrians were eventually obliged to retire before the attack of Turks, Kurds and Persians and to seek shelter in territory occupied by British forces. Eventually in 1918 they reached Iraq and were concentrated by the British authorities in a refugee camp at Baquba near Bagdad. On p. 102 of the published report on Iraq for the period October 1920-March 1922, in which their arrival at Baquba and subsequent attempts to settle them are described, the following statement occurred : &apos;&apos; A definite promise of settlement under a benevolent if not a British Government had been made to them.....&quot;It has been impossible to trace the promise referred to, and, possibly, the statement is only a loose reference to the alleged pledges by Captain Gracey; but a Foreign Office confidential memorandum of the 11th August, 1923, speaks of &quot; general assurances of help, which have been given since 1917.&quot;11. His Majesty&apos;s Government certainly did their utmost in the years immediately following the war to fulfil any obligation which they conceived them-selves to be under to the Assyrians. Not only were the refugees housed and fed at British expense at Baquba for three years, but after the break-up of that camp His Majesty&apos;s Government themselves contributed in 1921 and 1922 more than a quarter of a million sterling from public funds for Assyrian relief and settle--ment. (In a speech at the LaUsanne Conference in 1923, Sir H. Rumbold said that since the armistice His Majesty&apos;s Government had spent over  4,000,000 on the Assyrians.) Every effort was made to repatriate the Assyrians or to settle them in the northern parts of Iraq. The bulk of the ex-Ottomah Assyrians&apos;returned, in fact, to the Hakkiari district of Turkey, and between 1922 and 1924 there seemed good reason to hope that the Assyrian problem would solve itself.12. The Assyrians, however, continued to rely on British support, believing that they had finally embroiled themselves with Islam by their attitude during the war, and that if they stayed in Asia after the withdrawal of British troops they would be exterminated. Failure to conclude peace with Turkey created a feeling of insecurity, and Assyrian apprehensions were further aroused by the
signature in April 1923 of a protocol to the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of Alliance of 1922, providing that that treaty should terminate when Iraq became a member of the League of Nations, and at any rate not later than four years from the ratification of peace with Turkey, The Assyrians then petitioned for their establishment in their ancient homes (i.e., in Hakkiari) under a British protectorate. His Majesty&apos;s Government could not contemplate so grave an extension of their responsibilities, but they decided to meet Assyrian aspirations by aiming in the peace settlement with Turkey at the incorporation in Iraq of the Hakkiari territory.13. The Lausanne Treaty left the Turco-Iraqi frontier for future settle-ment, and, in the first place, an attempt was made to settle it at the Anglo-Turkish Conference at Constantinople in May 1924. Sir Percy Cox then put forward a claim for the inclusion within Iraq of the territory inhabited before the war by the Assyrians. He prefaced this claim with the statement that &quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government feel under the strongest obligation to secure their settle-ment in accordance with the reasonable claims and aspirations of their.race.&quot;The Turkish delegate, Fethi Bey, refused to consider this claim, which he regarded as unjust to Turkey, and he added that the Assyrians &quot; would still find in Turkish territory the tranquillity and prosperity which they enjoyed there for centuries, provided that they did not repeat the errors which they committed, with foreign encouragement, at the beginning of the Great War.&quot;14. The Constantinople Conference broke down on this point, and the question of the frontier was referred to the Council of the League of Nations. In a British memorandum addressed to the League on the 14th August. 1924, a further appeal was made for inclusion in Iraq of the Hakkiari territory, and this memorandum repeated that &quot;the British Government feel under the strongest obligation to secure., their settlement (i.e., the settlement of the Assyrians) in accordance with the reasonable claims and aspirations of their race.&apos;&apos;15. In September 1924 the League set up the Mosul Boundary Commission, which examined the question locally. Meanwhile, Fethi Bey&apos;s promise at the Constantinople Conference had been belied by the action of the Turkish Govern-ment in expelling once more from the Hakkiari district the Assyrians who had settled there.16. The recommendations of the Mosul Boundary Commission were contrary to the British claim for the incorporation of Hakkiari within Iraq. The commission expressed the view that whichever State became sovereign over the disputed territory ought to grant local autonomy to the Assyrians. There is little doubt that the commission was influenced by Fethi Bey&apos;s promise, and contemplated that the Assyrians would eventually drift back to Hakkiari. The Council, however, in promulgating its award on the basis of the commission^ recommendations, i.e., in rejecting the British claim to Hakkiari, invited the mandatory Power to grant the Assyrians a measure of autonomy in Iraq. It had already been made clear both to the Boundary Commission and to the Council that this was impracticable owing to the fact that suitable land did not exist in Iraq where the Assyrians could be settled in a homogeneous community.17. Since 1925 the Turkish Government have consistently denied the Assyrians access to their former homes.18. Although the statements made by Sir Percy Cox at the Constantinople Conference and in the British memorandum of the 14th August, 1924, may be quoted as a reason why His Majesty&apos;s Government should now make some special contribution towards Assyrian settlement, it is clear from the above that the main responsibility for the failure to settle the Assyrians lies with the Council of the League, and that His Majesty&apos;s Government are to a large extent absolved from their admitted obligations by the strenuous efforts which they made to secure the settlement of the Assyrians, free from Turkish rule, in their old homes in Hakkiari territory.19. There are, however, two other reasons which may be urged why His-Majesty&apos;s Government should make a special contribution. They are the service rendered by the Assyrians to His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Iraq levies and
sir Francis Humphrys&apos;s statement before the Permanent Mandates Commission in 1931 regarding the &quot; moral responsibility&quot; of His Majesty&apos;s Government.20. The argument that the Assyrians have served His Majesty&apos;s Govern^ ment in the levies is capable of being over-emphasised. The levies were originally an Arab force of military police, which gradually took over the work of preserving internal order from the British army in Mesopotamia. As a result of the decision at the Cairo Conference in 1922 to reduce the number of Imperial troops in Iraq, the levies were increased by the addition of Kurdish and Assyrian recruits, and the Assyrian element gradually increased until it is now about five-eighths of the whole force. This was due largely to the necessity for finding employment for the Assyrians, and service in the levies has been of very great economic advantage to the community as a whole. The Assyrians, in fact, are rather under an obligation to His Majesty5 s Government than vice versa. At the same time, there is no doubt that they have rendered good service, and, whatever the reason for their service, they deserve every consideration from His Majesty&apos;s Government. Our aerodromes in Iraq are at present largely dependent for their protection on Assyrians, and for that reason, if for no other, it will be well for His Majesty&apos;s Government to adopt as generous an attitude as possible on the question of the settlement of the Assyrian community.21. Perhaps Sir Francis Humphrys&apos;s declaration of moral responsibility will be urged as the strongest argument why His Majesty&apos;s Government should contribute. It is, in fact, not a very strong argument. The limited scope of the declaration has already been brought out in a separate memorandum. It referred solely to the responsibility of His Majesty&apos;s Government in declaring Iraq to be fit for membership of the League of Nations. It is true that the declaration was made to back up an opinion which Sir Francis Humphrys expressed in strong terms that the Iraqi Government could be relied upon to show tolerance towards minorities. It will be said that recent events have shown his opinion to be completely false. Such a statement is naturally difficult to disprove convincingly. But although the excesses against the Assyrians cannot be too strongly condemned, they began as reprisals for an Assyrian rebellion, and there is still no evidence of any systematic persecution of the Assyrians such as was feared by those who were sceptical of the expediency of terminating the mandatory regime. It cannot yet be said, in fact, that Iraq has proved herself unworthy of the confidence placed in her.22. It will be clear from this memorandum that His Majesty&apos;s Government have not, as is sometimes alleged, betrayed the Assyrians or broken any pledges towards them. They have, on the contrary, made every effort for their settlement under suitable conditions, but have been thwarted, in the first place by the Council - of the League, and in the second place by the obstinacy of the Assyrians them-selves, who have proved difficult to please in the matter of land, and have striven all along for a specially privileged position in Iraq. Nevertheless, though His Majesty&apos;s Government are under no specific obligation to take further action on their behalf, their attitude towards the Assyrians in the past, and their close connexion with them, make it difficult for His Majesty&apos;s Government to refuse to make some special contribution towards their future settlement. British prestige would be enormously enhanced by an offer to make such a contribution, whereas it would be seriously damaged by reluctance or refusal.J. C.
