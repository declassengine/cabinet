SECRET. CP.  271 (53).COPY NO.CABINET. AIR RAIDS PRECAUTIONS. Memorandum by the Home Secretary.At its meeting on the 16th November, 1932 (Cabinet 61 (32), Conclusion 6), the Cabinet decided to approve a report of the Air Raids Precautions (Organisation) Sub-Committee, requesting full discretion in regard to publicity on the understanding that such publicity would be gradual and would be carried out in such a manner as would preclude any possibility of unfortunate reactions or of our intentions being misinterpreted either in this country or abroad, but the Cabinet stipulated that public reference to the matter of air raids precautions should not go beyond the terms of the statement made by the Lord President of the Council in a speech in the House of Commons on the 10th November, 1932 (see extract attached) without a further decision from the Cabinet.A Question has now been put on the Order Paper by Mr. Mander for answer on the 16th Instant, in the following terms: -&quot;To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will give particulars of the action that is being taken to protect the civil population of London in the event of aerial attack.&quot;A similar Question has been put down by Brigadier-General Nation for answer on the same day.(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT).
Both. Members have, however, at my request, agreed to take their Questions off the Paper and put them down again in the new Session for answer on the 23rd instant.These Questions are symptomatic of a general feeling of public anxiety and curiosity, and for some weeks past speculation as to the nature of the protective measures . contemplated by the Government has been rife in the public press.I think that the time has now come when it would be in the public interest to make a statement in general terms setting out the nature of the protective measures which are being.worked out in detail.Certain of the air raid protective measures,  such, for example, as the preparation of the warning lists, have now reached a stage where further substantial progress cannot be made without a definite risk of attracting public notice;    on the other hand, if progress is not made in these directions the whole programme of precautionary measures is likely to be delayed.If my colleagues agree with this view, I should be glad to obtain their concurrence to my making an announcement at the end of Questions on Thursday the 23rd instant in the terms set out in the attached draft reply.(Intld.)   J.G.Home Office, November 14th, 1935.
f.ex t r A a to house OB1 COMMONS    -   Parliamentary Debates, 10th November5 19320I will not pretend that we are not taking our precautions in this country,,       We have done it0     We have made our investigations5 much more quietly and hitherto without any publicity, but, considering the years that are required to make your preparations, any Government of this country in the present circumstances of the world would have been guilty of criminal negligence had they neglected to make their preparations.,      The same is true of other nations.     What more potent cause of fear can there be than this kind of thing that is going on on the Continent?     And fear is a very dangerous thing.      It is quite true that it may act as a deterrent in people&apos;s minds against war, but it is much more likely to act to make them want to increase armaments to protect them against the terrors that they know may be launched against them.     We have to remember that aerial warfare is still in its infancy,  and its potentialities are incalculable and inconceivable.
Proposed Statement on Ai r Raids Precautions to be read,by the Pome Secretary-1. Every Government for the past nine years has givenclose attention tc the question of the protection of the civil population in the event of attack from the air-The first step -was. taken in 1924 when it was decided by the Government of the day to investigate, under the supervision of the Committee of Imperial Defence, the problems involved and to work our practical measures.2. It should be emphasised that this investigationbears no relation whatsoever to the present or any foreseen -international situation, and does not imply, and never has implied, that attack from the air is regarded as other than a remote contingency.      Successive Governments have, nevertheless, proceeded on the policy that they would be gravely neglecting their public duty were they to ignore a menace which might paralyse the country, and against which only the most detailed and prolonged preparation could have any chance.3. Ail the great Continental Powers and certain other powers have for some time past been taking active steps to prepare for a corresponding emergency:    steps they have been at no pains to conceal.4, The nucleus of the organisation v/hich has been de-vised for this purpose in this country consists of a small committee composed of the Ministers of the Departments most concerned.      This committee deals with matters of policy, but it is, of course, subject to the ultimate authority of the Cabinet.5. Under this Ministerial Committee is an organisation committee composed of representatives of all the
Departments concerned,-which acts as a central organising and co-ordinating authority for schemes of passive protec-tion.6. In view of the special position of London, attention has first been given to the measures that could be applied to the Metropolis. Latterly consideration has been given also to the provinces.7* General H.L.Pritchard, a distinguished Officer of theRoyal Engineers, now on the retired list, has been appointed by the Government to assist in the practical organisation of the work.8. The essence of all the measures contemplated is, sofar as possible, to adapt normal peace organisations to meet the needs of the situation, instead of relying on hasty improvisation.      Those who are working on them, under the direction of the Government, are authorised to consult, at the proper time, representatives of local authorities and .other bodies which might eventually be concerned in the execution of the plans.9. The House of Commons v/ould not expect me, nor would it be in the public interest for me, to give more than an outline of the measures that have been worked out.      But the following summary will, I hope, suffice to give in broad outline a general idea of the lines on v/hich this large problem is being tackled. Warning System.An organisation designed to locate and report the position of hostile aircraft and to give notice of impending air attack has been worked out.       This organisation, v/hich is tested from time to time, is based on an Observer Corps, manned principally by Special Constables. The scheme also, providesfor the issue, on a-pre-arranged plan, of - warnings
as occasion may require.1ighting Restr:1 ct iqns.The control of lighting will be the subject of detailed instructions,,      The object of the control is to give added security without causing needless interruption or disorganisation of work.Protection.Careful study is being given to methods of increasing the protection provided by buildings-of various types against the different risks and to the examination of protective measures which could be taken by their occupants.Maintenance of essential Pub 11 o Services.The problem of the maintenance, with the minimum of interruption, of such essential  services as food,transport,  communications, gas, water, electricity etc. is being worked out in consultation with the representa-tives of the services in question.Casualties.Plans have been prepared for the organisation of first aid;, ambulances and hospital services for the treatment of civilian casualties.       A scheme of com-pensation for death or personal injury caused to civilians while carrying on work required for the main-ten ance of the life of the country is also being worked out in detai1.Police and Fire Brigades.The organisation of the duties of the Police and Fire Brigades in the emergency is in hand.
Anti --gas Measures.In view of the specific undertakings of the Geneva Gas Protocol3 1935, the risk of attack by gas is con-sidered remote.      The necessity for taking precautionary measures cannot, ,however, be  overlooked.     Much work has been done on the design of a cheap and serviceable gas mask, and a specification has been drawn up for suitable protective clothing.      The organisation of de-contamination services is also well advanced, and steps are contemplated for the training of selected personnel in anti-gas measures.10.      His Majesty&apos;s Government are glad to have been given this  opportunity of making this public announcement. The House may rest assured that there will be no relaxation of thed^fort to devise suitable measures of protection for the civil population of this country.
