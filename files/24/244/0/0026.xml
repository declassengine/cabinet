(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT).COPY NO .      OSECRET.CP.  276  (33)CABINET. INDIA.Appreciation of the Political Situation by the Government of India,   dated 22nd November 1933.Circulated for the information of the Cabinet by the Secretary of State for India.
Confidential Appreciation of the Political Situation in India,  dated 22nd November,1933 issued on the authority of the Secretary of State for India.Reports fer the month of October confirm the view expressed last month that the Civil Disobedience movement fwr, the time being has almost ceased.      Thus from Bombay it is reported that nothing was heard of Civil Disobedience during the last half of October, and that even Swadeshi and anti-untouchability propaganda had died down.      In the United Provinces,  the only activities were occasional small outbursts of picketing by hired Congress workers,  and there were only 6 convictions in the first half of October.      Other Provinces remain quiet.      The end of October showed a further decrease in the total number of Civil Disobedience prisoners in all provinces except in Bengal,  where the number increased by   only.      There are now 3861 such prisoners,  a decrease of 438 since the end of September.Generally, Congress politics are in a state of confusion..    There appears to be growing dissatisfaction both with the methods and with the policy adopted.by Gandhi and Pandit Jawahar Lai Nehru.      Thus a Bombay member of the Working Committee,  immediately on his release from jail, published a statement questioning the validity of the decision of the Poona Conference and criticising it as a violation of democratic principles and appealed to leaders to maintain the constitutional rights of Congress.      Attempts are being made to form new parties which though nominally owing allegiance to Congress advocate a change of policy.
2.Of these,  one of the most important is the Democratic Swaraj Party inaugurated in Maharashtra Districts of Bombay v/hich defines its creed as &quot;Purna Swaraj  (complete independence)  by all peaceful and legitimate means&quot; and stands for capture and acceptance of power in all represen-tative bodies from village boards to provincial and federal legislatures and Governments.      A similar aim is expressed by the Congress Swaraj Party, Madras, while in Bengal there are distinct signs of a growing feeling that boycott of Councils must be abandoned.The demand for a meeting of the all-India Congress Committee is still being discussed by those who wish for a change of policy.Although last month it seemed possible that Nehru himself was in favour of a meeting, he now appears to be temporising and uncertain.      He is also growing more intolerant of those who differ from his view and has recently made a vehement attack on the Hindu Mahasabha, the main communal organisation of the Hindus, which has, in the past,  had many contacts with Congress.      This attack was called forth by the proceedings of a recent conference of the Hindu Mahasabha at Ajmer.      The conference,  at which many of the speeches were very communal in tone, passed a resolution that &quot;The Hindus as a community can no longer afford to ignore the various means open,   in and out of constitution,  to protect and promote their interests&quot;,  a frank recognition of the futility of the Congress policy of non-co-operation.      The President&apos;s speech was criticised in the Congress press for its repudiation of Congress policy, but Nehru&apos;s attack on Sabha appears to be exciting even stronger criticism.Recent outrages by revolutionary gangs in Bengal,

He is also growing more intolerant of those who differ from his view and has recently made a vehement attack on the Hindu Mahasabha, the main communal organisation of the Hindus, which has, in the past, had many contacts with Congress.

The President&apos;s speech was criticised in the Congress press for its repudiation of Congress policy, but Nehru&apos;s attack on Sabha appears to be exciting even stronger criticism.Recent outrages by revolutionary gangs in Bengal,
3.following on the murder of the District Magistrate of Midnapore, Mr. Surge, have tended to create the impression that the official view of the improvement in the situation was irnduly optimistic.      It is desirable,  therefore,  to examine the position in some detail.      The war against terrorism must be a war of attrition.      The experiences of 1917 and again of 19 26-27 show that even then, when the movement was less widespread and the jjoison less deep-seated, the campaign had to be carried on with vigour for a considerable period before the movement could he said to he under control.During the last year much progress has been made as is shown by the reduction in the total number of serious outrages.   - Police are obtaining more extensive and accurate information, -in itself a sign of the success of their operations - and have been successful in stopping minor conspiracies,  in making seizures of arms and ammunition,, and in securing arrests of revolutionary leaders, such as the principal leader in Chittagong district,  Surjya Sen, who has been condemned to death with one of his associates by a special tribunal,  a sentence recently confirmed by the High Court.      In October, four serious dacoities or robberies were committed by revolutionary gangs, but the police have succeeded in arresting many of the culprits,  thanks largely to the assistance received from local inhabitants;      in one case in which an armed party of 15 attacked a railway station, half the gang were followed up by a constable who secured the assistance of a local landlord who turned out with a number of his men and skilfully arranged the capture of the whole party at a ferry crossing.This is the bright side of the picture.      Against this
must be set the fact that there are still marked indications of sympathy with terrorists, or if not sympathy,  of reluctance to take any effective action against the movement, while the press still continues to draw attention to &quot;repressive&quot; acts of the Government rather than to strengthen-ing public opinion against this menace.      The fact must also never be lost sight of that recruits to the movement can without difficulty be obtained from a generation which has been brought up in an atmosphere of hostility to the Government and with most depressing economic prospects, and that as long as even a handful of leaders are at large, it is not difficult to keep the movement alive and to organise isolated outrages.      The problem of dealing with active terrorists is being met steadily by the consistent policy followed by the Government of Bengal:      the more difficult problem of destroying what may be called the terrorist mentality remains to be solved.
