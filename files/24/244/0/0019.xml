&quot; (1) Having considered the whole position they are satisfied that the advantages of con-tinning negotiations overweigh   the dis-advant ages and they accordingly recommend that the Cabinet should adhere to its previous decision;(2) That the Foreign Office should inform the Italian Government that Colonel Re illy, the Resident at Aden? will go to Sanaa in order to negotiate a Treaty, and.that as it is the common object of both the British and Italian Governments to prevent the outbreak of hostilities between the Imam and Ibn Baud Colonel Reilly will take advantage of his presence at Sanaa to use his best efforts to achieve this object;(3) That should hostilities actually break out between the Imam and Ibn Saud a situation might arise in which it might be necessary to reconsider this decision&quot;.(Initialled)      P.C-L.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.I., 14th November, 1933.
-    16.1S DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government )COPY NO.COMMITTEE OP IMPERIAL DEFENCE.STANDING MINISTERIAb flJB^COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS CONCERNING THE &quot;MIDDLE&quot; EAST.TREATY NEGOTIATIONS, WITH THE IMAM OF THE YEMEN,On the 5th of September the Cabinet had under consideration the question of continuing negotiations for a treaty with &quot;the Imam of the Yemen,        The question had been previously considered by the Standing Official Sub-Committee for Questions concerning the Middle Easts and the recommendations of that Committee were as follows&quot;(a)      That there now seems a reasonable possibility of bringing the  treaty negotiations to a successful conclusion if an envoy a an be sent to Sanaa for personal discussion with the I mam j       provided the envoy is previously authorised,,  should the Imam prove obdurate -(i)    To inform the Imam that the breaking off of negotiations will inevitably follow failure by the Imam and the envoy to reach agreement i    that the envoy feels sure that His Majestyfs Government will not any longer tolerate the presence of Zeidi forces in territory which His Majesty&apos;s Government claim for the Aden Protectorate!    and that if negotiations are broken offs His Majesty&apos;s Government will in all probability feel compelled to assert forcibly their rights in Audhali5 and other territory occupied by Zeidi forces.EC RET.
(ii)   To break off negotiations.NOTEs      In point of fact, it is hoped that if the Resident is placed in a position to make a statement of this kind it will clinch the negotiations and avoid the need for any forcible action for clearing the Audhali territory, but the envoy must have an assurance  that, if ne ce s s ar y. Hi s Ma j e s ty&apos;s Go ve rri-nient will use force to clear the Audhali country and other areas in the Protectorate occupied by Zeidi forces,  as the position will be quite impossible unless  an ultimatum can be sent to the Imam after the negotiations are broken off0(b) That while continuance of negotiations for a treaty may be regarded as a departure, in a strict sense,  from the instructions&quot;approved earlier in the year to the effect that His Majesty&apos;s Government had said their last word, the Imam&apos;s letter can be accepted as a sufficient ant advance to justify the Acting Resident informing the Imam that the Resident will come to Sanaa on his return in the autumn, for the purpose of ooncluditp; a treaty;      but that in order that there may be no misapprehension, the Imam must understand that His Majesty&apos;s Government require the trade restrictions to &quot;be raised and the other preliminaries laid down in the Resident&apos;:s admonitory note to be carried out &quot;before the treaty is actually signed,  and that while the Resident will be prepared to discuss matters of wording in the text of the treaty .proposed by the Imam, the secret annexe cannot be agreed to  in any formD(c) That in the event of action becoming necessary for the recovery of Audhali territory, it is essential that authority shculd be given for &quot;bombing, after the usual warnings, suitable military objectives within Imamic territory,  aid that we must not be limited to local action in the friendly Audhali territory now occupied by the Zeidis and on our side of the boundary&quot;o20    These recommendations  are contained in Cabinet Paper
210 (33) of the 30th August, and were approved by the Cabinet on the 5th September,,3. Instructions were sent to the Acting Residentaccordinglys and,  as soon as the  Resident reached. Aden on his return from leave, he telegraphed (on the 25th October) that he was now proposing to address a letter to the Imam accepting his invitation to visit Sanaa.      Since the end of August, however,  the state of tension between Ibn Saud and -the Imam has been increasing, and recently there has appeared to be a serious risk of the outbreak of hostilities between the two Rulers.      On the receipt of the Resident&apos;s telegram of the 25th October,   the Foreign Office made urgent representations to the Colonial Office that the Resident should be instructed not to despatch the letter to the Imam until there had been time to consider the developments in the situation.      As a result of these representations the Resident was instructed not to despatch his letter to the Imam for the present.      Since that date the position has formed the subject of   correspondence between the Colonial Office and the Foreign Office, and on the 4th November the Foreign Office addressed a letter to the Colonial Office in which they set  out in detail their objections to the Resident making an immediate visit to Sanaa.4. The Foreign Office are of opinion that if negotiations are immediately resumed with the Imam, undesirable reactions will arise in the relations of His Majesty&apos;s Government with King Ibn Saud and the Italian Government.      The Foreign Office view is that it would be undesirable from the point of view of Anglo-Saudi relations that the Resident should be conducting treaty negotiations at a time when the Imam was engaged in open hostilities with Ibn Saud.      They have substantial reasons for believing that the danger of the
outbreak of an armed conflict between the Imam and King Ibn Saud, which now appears so imminent, has been brought about by the policy of the Imam rather than that of King Ibn Saud.      In these circumstances,  the Foreign Office regard it as inadvisable that His Majesty&apos;s Government should make any advances to the Imam which might be interpreted as offering him encouragement,  and they consider that the mere fact that Lieutenant-Colonel Reilly was at Sanaa for the purpose of negotiating a treaty settlement while hostilities were actually proceeding would not unnaturally prejudice the impartiality of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the eyes of Ibn Saud, and to that extent weaken their influence in dealing with him in the present crisis as.well as over matters of more direct mutual con-cern.5. The Foreign Office further contend that in theinterest of Anglo-Italian co-operation,  it is undesirable that we should bring pressure to bear on the Imam at the present time, as the Italians would accuse us of taking advantage of the Imam&apos;s present difficulties.6. The Foreign Office further contend thathostilities might break out before the Resident reached Sanaa,  or while he was in the middle of negotiations, which it would then be difficult to break off.      They -consider that the present position affords an opportunity to His Majesty&apos;s Government of actually influencing the Imam in favour of agreeing to negotiations with Ibn Saud, and they suggest that the Resident should be instructed to reply to the Imam in the following terms. &quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government have duly considered the Imam&apos;s letter of the 20th June and are in principle willing to resume negotiations and to/
instruct the Resident to visit Sanaa to that end. -They have learned, however,  with regret&quot;  that there is an imminent possibility of the outbreak of an armed conflict between the Imam and King Ibn Saud.      While wishing to maintain the present fortunate state of relations with both rulers,  they consider that it would be open to misunderstanding were they to give to one party at the present juncture so special a mark of their friendly attitude as would be involved in the despatch to Sanaa for the first time after a long interval of a highly placed official.      They regret,  therefore, that the Resident&apos;s visit to Sanaa must be postponed until the situation between the Imam and King Ibn Saud is such    so as to preclude the likelihood of hostilities during the stay of the mission at Sanaa.&quot;7. The Colonial Office are strongly opposed tothe Foreign Office proposal.      In his letter ofthe 20th June the Imam invited the Resident to pro-ceed to Sanaa to negotiate a treaty and agreed inprinciple to the demand of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentthat he  should evacuate the districts of the aden protectorate which he now occupies, and should with-draw his embargo on Protectorate trade, before theactual signature of the treaty.      This is a mostimportant advance in the Imam&apos; s previous attitude.If there is considerable delay in continuing negotiations,the Imam may again take up a more intransigentattitude and the present propitious moment for obtaining a treaty may pass.      Moreover,  if HisMajesty&apos;s Government are unable to obtain the evacuation of the Audhali district and the removal of the trade
embargo by means of negotiations,   they will almost certainly he faced with unrest in the Protectorate leading to incidents which will compel them to take hostile action against the Imam.        The Resident has repeatedly informed us that he has only kept the Audhali tribe quiet by assuring them that he was doing his best to obtain by negotiation the evacuation of their territory, and if it becomes known that those attempts are indefinitely suspended, unrest among the tribe would certainly lead to frontier incidents which could only be followed by hostilities against the Imam.      The Foreign Office would presumably not welcome such hostilities, as they would re-act unfavourably on our relations with the Italians,8. The Colonial Office cannot accept the viewof the Foreign Office  that the despatch of the Resident to Sanaa could only be regarded by Ibn Saud as a direct encouragement to the Imam.      The negotiations for a treaty with the Imam have been (as Ibn Saud is aware,  or can be informed) in pro-gress for a number of years and they are being con-tinued at the present time in the normal course after only such delay as has been necessary owing to the Resident&apos;s absence on leave and discussion of the Imam&apos;s proposals among the Departments concerned. Moreover,  the Colonial Office hold that  the Foreign Office proposal to inform the Imam that the negotiations will be suspended unless he can come to terms with Ibn Saud,  of which His Majesty&apos;s Government approve, would obviously be a breach of
our attitude of impartiality towards the two parties to the dispute.      It may he added that it is difficult to understand why action which consists in informing the Imam that unless he concludes a satisfactory Treaty, we shall take air action to enforce our rights, can he said to he favouring the Imam unduly at the expense of Ibn Saud.9.- We have fully discharged all our obligations tothe Italian Government.      We know that the Italian Government wish to prevent us from concluding a Treaty with the Imam.      The conclusion of such a Treaty is vital to the Aden Protectorate and conflicts with no legitimate Italian interest.      If we sacrifice our own essential interests to Italian susceptibilities now, we shall find it no easier to withstand their claims later;   but we shall find that Italian influence has made the Imam more, intractable.10.        In the Colonial Office view it would only be possible to justify the suspension of the negotiations at the present time if such a state of war existed in the Yemen as would render the visit of the Resident inconvenient or dangerous.      There is no indication that such a condition exists, or is immediately probable, and the Resident would have ample time to postpone or curtail his visit if such a situation were to arise. 11.       Moreover, it will be recollected that.at the same time as the Cabinet authorised the continuance of negotiations with the Imam, they approved the despatch of an ultimatum to the Imam in connection with certain incursions by his forces into the Subeihi country. This ultimatum was duly delivered.      The Imam complied with all the demands of His Majesty&apos;s Gevernment and it
was not necessary to resort to hostile measures. The present is a particularly favourable moment, therefore, for the Resident to continue negotiations with the Imam. on the basis approved &quot;by the Cabinet. The Imam will, at the moment, have formed the opinion that His Majesty&apos;s Government are no longer prepared to tolerate the presence and activities of Zeidi forces in the Protectorate, and he will, therefore, be&apos; unlikely to refuse his signature to a treaty, knowing that the result of such action will be the despatch of a further ultimatum in connection with his occupation of the Audhali country.12.        Finally, the Resident himself has represented the undesirabi1ity of postponement.      On the 27th October he telegraphed stating that he hoped, that the delay would be short as a reply to the Imam is over-due and the local situation is now favourable for the resumption of negotiations, which the Imam is expecting on the Resident&apos;s return from leave.      The Resident thinks that undesirable re-actions may be produced by continued silence on our part.      The Resident has great knowledge of our past relations with the Imam and long experience in the Aden Protectorate.      The Colonial Office view is that the greatest weight should be attached to his considered advice.13.        In these circumstances,  the Colonial Office ask that the Cabinet decision should be maintained.(Intld.)       P.C-L.COLONIAL OFFICE,DOWNING STREET.10th November,  1933.
