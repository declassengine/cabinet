THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENTaSECRET. COPY NO. ^ 9____C.Pf  251(33).CABINET.the  TARIFF TRUCE.The Question of Withdrawal.Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.1,   As my colleagues will &quot;be aware, the French Government have recently made a reservation to the Tariff Truce, which in fact amounts to a withdrawal from it.    This reservation states that, while continuing to adhere to the Truce the French Government is obliged, for constitutional reasons, to reserve the right of initiative of the French Parliament in tariff matters, and it must also reserve the right to take all measures required to protect the vital interests of the country.2.   Before the French took this action, the Netherlands, bveden and the Irish Free btate had already formally withdrawn from the Truce, while reservations made &quot;by a number of other countries to it have in fact deprived their adherence of much meaning.3.    The question of our continued adherence to the Tariff Truce was examined at the end of July, when it was, agreed that we should continue to adhere to it, pending either a decision as to a further session of the Monetary and Economic Conference, or until other countries of importance withdrew or took action infringing the Truce.4.    In view of the French Governments action,  the time has come to review our adherence to what has &quot;become a rather threadbare instrument.      It would of course be open to u6
(as I have pointed out in my memorandum on French discrimination - CP. 248) to make reservations similar to those made by the French Government; but I dislike the indefinite continuation of vague and general international obligations which are unlikely to be respected in fact, I accordingly recommend that we should withdraw altogether from the Truce, explaining that we have decided to adopt this course as, having regard to the numerous and far-reaching reservations Virhioh have been made to the Truce, we feel that it has outlasted its r,erm of usefulness.Board of Trade.1st November, 1933.
