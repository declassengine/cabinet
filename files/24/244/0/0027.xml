THIS DOCUirfiNT IS TH i PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC. MAJESTY *S GOVERNMENT.SECRET. COPY NO._ 1 -lCP. 877(33)CABINET.SP-SOIAL DUTIES ON ERI3NCH GOODS. Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.(1) In accordance with the decision of the Cabinet reached on the 2nd November (Cabinet 59(33) conclusion 10), I circulate the draft of an Order which, subject to the approval of my colleagues, I propose to make under Section 12 of the Import Duties Act imposing special duties on French goods if the French Government meanwhile do not give us satisfaction by removing their discriminatory measures against British goods.     I should propose to make the Order on the evening of the 5th December so that it may come into force on the 8th December, immediately after the expiry of our notice to withdraw from the Tariff Truce.     I wish to draw the attention of my colleagues to the following points,(2) Countries to which the duty applies.     I propose that the duty shall apply to goods produced or manufactured in France (excluding the Saar Basin), Algeria and Tunisia.     I propose to include Algeria and Tunisia both because these dependencies discriminate against us and because their inclusion may help in the removal of the French discriminations from certain of our Colonies to which they applyt namely, the Straits Settlements, Ceylon, the Malay States and Hong Kong. There are other French dependencies which also discriminate against us, but, having regard to the character of the goods they send ue, their inclusion would involve considerable inconvenience without practical result.
(3) Range of goods to be covered.     The French discriminatory duties effect United Kingdom goods to the value in 1932 of about 38^ million and I therefore propose to apply our measures to French goods amounting in value to about this total.     The actual list of goods hps been selected on the following principles:-(a) materials of British industry should be excluded as far as possible j(b) it is desirable that as wide a range of French interests as possible should be affected, particularly among the agricultural interests;(c) for reasons of administrative convenience,  it is desirable not to include goods of which the French supplies are very small in relation to those from adjoining countries.(4)    In view of the possibility of the French retaliating by discriminating against our important trade in coal,  it is desirable to hold in reserve some commodities on which the French are specially sensitive.     For this reason wine end brandy have not been included in the scheme.     Our imports of wine and brandy from France amount to about  2.  million a year, while our exports of coal amount to about  7f million, but there are a number of other classes of goods of relatively minor importance which could be included in any further order.(5) Height of special duties.   The French discriminatio against ue in the matter of the surtax and of the differentia import turnover tax are roughly equivalent to 20fi ad, valorem I propose, therefore, that the special duties on French goods should in general be SOfs ad valorem;   but where the present ordinary duties are specific I propose, for reasons of administrative convenience, to substitute specific duties as near as may be equivalent to 2o% ad valorem.W. R. oerd of Trade,23rd November, 1933.
