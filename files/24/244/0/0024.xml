3ECRET.3.P. 874(55).COPY NO.CABINET..FRENCH DISCRIMINATION AGAINST UNITED KINGDOM GOODS. Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.My colleagues will wish to &quot;be informed of the progress of the discussions with the French Government.In accordance with the decision of the Cabinet on November 2nd, I saw the French Ambassador on the following day. I reminded him that In April last M. Georges Bonnet had promised the Chancellor of the Exchequer that the 15% exchange compensation surtax and the differential import turnover tax now charged on British goods on importation into France would be withdrawn unconditionally but that this promise had not been implemented; and I informed him that His Majesty&apos;s Government, who had had the matter under most careful consideration once more, had decided (Cabinet 59(55)10) that, if within a month they did not receive satisfactory assurances from the French Government, that both forms of discrimination would be withdrawn, they would be compelled to impose a special duty as nearly as possible equivalent on a corresponding range of French goods.     I also told him that His Majesty&apos;s Government had decided to withdraw from the Tariff Truce, and that they could not any longer consider themselves as bound by the Declaration made by His Majesty&apos;s Government and the French Government at the close of the Lausanne Conference.His Excellency said he would report what I had said to his Government.On November 6th, the French Ambassador called at the ForeignOffice and at the same time the Commercial Attache&apos; called at theBoard of Trade to say that the French Government were about to formulate a new proposal for meeting His Majesty&apos;s Governmenton the subject.     He hoped in the meantime that no official announcement on behalf of H.M. Government would be made either inParis or London.     I agreed that no public announcement-1-if his DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.
should be made for the moment bo long as the French Government clearly understood that the month&apos;s notice of v/hich I had informed the Ambassador ran from November 3rd.The French Ambassador came to see me on November loth to inform me of the new proposals of the French Government.     They we re that:-(l) His majesty&apos;s Government should not insist on the abolition of the 15% exchange compensation surtaxo(2) In return the French Government would not apply to this country the new quota system which they were bringing into force on the 1st January next,  that is to say, that the French Government would be prepared without negotiation   to allow United Kingdom goods 1005*5 of the quotas fixed and would not, as they would do in other cases, give only 25&apos;,i of the quota and reserve tho remaining 75$ to be given only in exchange for concessions.(3) The French Government would spare no effort to obtain Parliamentary consent to the early withdrawal of the 4/a and 6$ turnover tax on United Kingdom goods.This visit was followed by a Note,  setting out the proposals and stating the French Government would, in addition,  expect to receive some reductions of duty on certain goods of special interest to French trade, having regard to the hardships inflicted on French trade by the Ministry of Agriculture&apos;s prohibitions. This point had not been mentioned at the interview.I promised that I would make an early reply, and on the 13th November, I wrote to His Excellency to the general effect that the proposals which he had made could not for one moment be entertained.     The proposal amounted to this, that we should continue to countenance discrimination against this country in one form,  and in return the French Government would not introduce a new form of discrimination next year by the operation of the quota system.     I reminded him that under the Convention of February, 1802, between the two Governments,United Kingdom goods
were unconditionally entitled to full most-favourad-nation treatment in all mattetb other than Customs duties and that we could not regard our right to most-favoured-nation treatment in the matter of quota restrictions as one which could form the subject of a new bargain.     I added that we were ready at any time to conclude an arrangement by which the determination of each country to abandon all forms of discrimination against the other would be clearly put on record, but, if the existing forms of discrimination which the French Government practised against our trade wane maintained, I could only repeat   that we should, however reluctantly, be compelled to carry out the decision at which we had already arrived and to impose a special duty as nearly as possible equivalent on a corresponding range of French goods.I have since received a request that no publicity should be given to the matter at the present stage of the negotiations and I understand that the French Minister of Commerce intends to come to London in a day or two&apos;s time to see me on the subject.Board of Trade,15th November, 1933V.E.
