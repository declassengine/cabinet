November 1933.SECRET.Copy No.0CP. 260 (33).CABINET.AGRICULTURAL POLICY  IN  USA.Note by Minister of A griculture and Fisheries.MY colleagues may be interested to see the attached speech by the United States Secretary for Agriculture, which contains an important declaration of policy and is quoted by Sir Herbert Samuel in his article in the Times of the 31st October.Supply and Demand, Political Pressure and the Long Look Ahead.Address before the Grain Dealers&apos; Association, Chicago, Illinois, 10-30 a.m.,September 20, 1933.The grain dealers of Central and Western United States are probably as well Iposted on the law of supply and demand as any other group of business men anywhere else in the world. Day by day and year by year, they see the law in action. They know that when the crop is big, the price per bushel is less. They have a terrible fear of price-fixing and stabilisation efforts, partly because such things interfere with their business, but also because they honestly believe in an intellectual way that price-fixing and the purchase of large stocks usually result in the &quot; headache of the morning after.&quot; Some of the more scholarly of the grain dealers have gone back into history and have discovered from the records of the ancient Chinese, the Greeks and the Romans that all attempts at price-fixing have come to naught. Most students who dip superficially into these sketchy accounts of former experiments fail to note that a number of experiments were grounded in sound economics and successfully lasted for a generation or more, thus accomplishing the purposes of the immediate future. Their eventual failure was probably due to a lack of flexibility in adjusting the control plans to conditions that inevitably changed. And, incidentally, I may say that when you read the account of these ancient attempts, you are astonished at the apparently modern presentation, whether it comes from the time of Confucius or Solon or Diocletian.Those of the grain trade who confine their researches to more modern times take great pleasure in presenting the case of Brazilian coffee valorisation, the Stevenson rubber plan in the East Indies, or the still more recent efforts of our own Farm Board. And I have no doubt that some of these gentlemen are now waiting eagerly in the hope that they may live long enough to add a description of our own efforts since the 4th March to this long historic array of those who failed to worship properly at the shrine of the law of supply and demand.(Initialled)W. E. E.Ministry of Aqriculture and Fisheries, November 3, 1933.(H. A. Wallace.)[9241]B
In a world of universal peace, no tariffs^ no export quotas, no corporations, no labour unions, I am confident that the law of supply and demand would work in the fully beneficent way envisioned by the classical economists. It would be a marvellous thing to see goods freely flowing over wide areas without artificial compulsion. Unfortunately, we are to-day a long distance from that kind of world. The dominant fact to-day is the terrific disruption still flowing from the World War. During the Great War, the economic machine was. taken over in large measure by the Government, and soon thereafter the people of the United States expressed their hatred of any artificial control by electing a candidate who stood for what he called &quot; normalcy.&quot; Government controls were relaxed, and it seemed to many by 1928 that the key to a universal and never-ending prosperity had been discovered. During the eight years of Harding and Coolidge, great reverence was done to the short-time operations of the law of supply and demand, but, unfortunately, there was no understanding of the long-time operations of this remorseless law acting in a world of wars, tariffs, corporations and labour unions. Above all, no account was taken whatever of the fact that the United States had become a creditor nation and that, in spite of this, she was still insisting on selling more stuff abroad than she was importing. A creditor nation, which insists on selling more abroad than it imports and which demands the payment of foreign debts to the last dollar while at the same time it shrieks for high tariffs, is due for a more terrific disillusionment than the operators of coffee valorisation or Stevenson rubber plans.The failure of the nations of the world to recognise the changes in supply and demand forces because of the changes in the debtor and creditor positions of the different nations has brought about political situations which cannot be reckoned with under the simple supply, and demand philosophy of the classical economists. It may surprise you to hear me say it, but I believe it is true, that most of us who are operating the New Deal are essentially old-fashioned in our understanding of economic laws. In the Agricultural Department since the 4th March, we have done our best to keep in mind at all times the fact that the law of supply and demand is remorseless in its operations, and that attempts to fix prices without control of production are doomed to failure. During the past two weeks an increasing number of farmers in the South and Middle West have demanded price-fixing of farm products. One of the most, intelligent Governors in the Middle West wired the President, suggesting that the Govern-ment peg prices so that farm prices might go up as fast as the prices of things purchased by farmers. Not only the Farmers&apos; Union, but a very large element in the Farm Bureau, has now gone over to price-fixing. One of my best friends, an editor of one of the most influential farm papers in the Middle West, has thrown his influence on the side of price-fixing for farm products as the best method of enabling farm income to keep in fair relationship with retail prices. Most of the price fixers are also inflationists. If the purchasing power of farm products does -not improve during the next three months, the price fixers and inflationists will have great power in Congress this coming winter, and there will be passed legislation which will make the Agricultural Adjustment Act seem extraordinarily conservative.Few people realise what a fundamental effect the Agricultural Adjustment programme is likely to have on prices after the first of the year.. In the case of hogs, butter, cotton and tobacco, we have done or are in the process of doing such fundamental things relating to supply that, within a few months, the effects are hound to be apparent. There is very little reason so far why our activities in the Agricultural Adjustment Administration should have been apparent, because you know as well as I that you can&apos;t change fundamental supply conditions all at once. Farming just isn&apos;t made that way. Crops only come around once a year. Farmers have asked why we did not use N.R.A. methods. I would call your attention to the fact that our problem is one of dealing with 6 million farmers on a voluntary basis, whereas the problem of N.R.A. is to deal with a few hundred thousand corporations which are accustomed to control of production and the making of contracts. Psychological methods which work with industry are not adapted to farming.It has been suggested in many quarters, in view of the practical certainty of substantial agricultural price rises after the 1st January, that price-fixing should be invoked so far as possible under the Agricultural Adjustment Act, to make sure that the higher prices prevail at once, before any considerable
percentage of farm produce has passed into other hands. I have no doubt, for example, that if we licensed all of the packers under an agreement to pay a price for hogs of 1 dollar a hundred higher than the present price, this price could be made to stick, in view of the way in which the market is fundamentally supported for the time being by our extensive slaughter of little pigs. The farmers are perfectly familiar with this situation, and all over the country there is a great cry for price-fixing to tide over the period during the next three or four months, while the N.R.A. is increasing pay-rolls and costs, and before those pay-rolls are yet fully reflected in farm product prices. While I think we will have decidedly higher agricultural prices within a few months, perhaps even within a few weeks, if some of our plans mature properly, I want to direct your attention with all the forces at my command to the long look ahead, which I feel that 999 out of 1,000 people in this country continually refuse to take. I wish there were some extraordinary act equivalent to a thousand N.R.A. parades rolled into one which could make the people of the United States conscious of certain forces which they have not yet understood, and which will cause them long years of the greatest misery if not recognized. It would be easy for me to-day to point out that, in spite of the many wails of anguish in different parts of the country, the total increase in industrial pay-rolls from the very low point of March is about 65 per cent., the purchasing power of farm products is 20 per cent, above March, and far more businesses are making money than during last March. It would be easy to say that never in history has there been such a rapid improvement in any nation&apos;s affairs as in this nation&apos;s during the past six months.But this improvement, while it may expand for a year or two with only temporary setbacks, will come to a sad end if we are not prepared to meet the peril produced by the following forces : First: America is a creditor nation to the tune 1 billion dollars annually, but, as a nation, she has a debtor psychology.Second: The American people. Democrats and Republicans alike, are still essentially high tariff in their attitude. Reciprocal tariff agreements may be negotiated, but the increase in foreign purchasing power resulting thereby will not be sufficient to enable foreign countries to pay a satisfactory price for our surplus wheat and cotton unless the attitude of the American people and American Congressmen changes very radically.Third: The American people are disillusioned about lending money abroad and it will be difficult to float foreign loans in their present temper.These three forces mean that, for the time being, our people are profoundly nationalistic, and that, as long as they are operating on this basis, we should go at it whole-heartedly to put our internal economy on a nationalistic basis, reducing our crop land acreage by 40 million acres. This is what we are now doing. But unfortunately this kind of a programme in action also will, sooner or later, provoke tremendously the prejudices of the rank and file of our people unless not only the farmers, but also the city consumers as well, know why we are doing this kind of thing. Frankly, I am hoping that we will not be forced to retire completely from the foreign market with our farm produces, but that instead, and before long, we will be able to some extent to pick out vast quantities of foreign goods which we in the United States will be willing to accept. I am-hoping even that in time we will be willing again to lend money abroad, but I am terribly frightened about the lending of money abroad unless we know just what we are going to receive eventually in return for that money, and unless we are prepared, if necessary, to lower tariffs to make it possible for such goods in repayment to come in.If we persist in our high tariff policy, or even in a half-way modification of it, and at the same time collect in full the money which is owed us abroad, and refuse to lend money abroad, it will take superhuman efforts on the part of the Agricultural Adjustment Administration year after year to keep down our acreage to a point which will afford a living price to American farmers. It is all a question of balancing our American productive forces to the kind of world we want to live in. Ever since the war, we have failed to decide what kind of world that was to be. We are still in doubt. We are for the time being, through the Agricultural Adjustment Administration, helping build a bridge toward a nationalistic economy, and yet what I really hope is that we are merely tiding [9241] b 2
over a difficult situation, and that, instead of retiring completely from the world market, our people will soon come to their senses sufficiently to be willing to make rational adjustments in the tariff, and eventually even in the policy of lending money abroad. If we do not do these things, I know that we must be prepared to act much more radically with regard to our internal economy than any person in this room is as yet prepared to do. I want to urge on all of you the necessity of working to the limit for sound ways of increasing foreign purchasing power for our surplus farm products. We cannot safely stop our programme of acreage control until we have demonstrated our ability to expand foreign purchasing power in a definite, tangible way.In our efforts to make adjustments, we find wherever we turn that there are entrenched selfish interests. We, therefore, have tried a great variety of short-time adjustments, but every one of them, as long as this underlying situation is not faced, brings about within a short time, an outcry from some other class. Each particular group, when it sees itself in danger, gets in touch with certain Governors, Congressmen or Senators and descends on Washington. Calls are made on one of the Secretaries or the President, and simultaneously a statement is issued to the press. High pressuring of this sort often results in action which is highly desirable, but at other times, it is hasty and ill-considered, and bound to provoke the most serious reaction from some other group later on. A Government can stand a considerable amount of battering of this sort. The unfortunate thing about it all is that when a situation is temporarily solved by political pressure in this way, the people begin to think that the Government can solve all economic problems indefinitely by a wave of the Magic Wand. For example, last summer when the Chicago Board of Trade temporarily set minimum prices with the con-currence of the Secretary of Agriculture, it was widely inferred that the Govern-ment had set a minimum price. In the South I was asked why I did not set a minimum price for cotton. Of course, this attitude on the part of our people is extremely dangerous. It causes them to think that problems can be easily and simply solved by governmental fiat. I think the centralising power of the Government can be of tremendous help, but it can also be very dangerous unless our people are widely educated concerning the supply and demand elements in the various commodities, and at this point I would like to say that I do not think the operators on the Board of Trade have any monopoly of this knowledge. In fact, I think that their knowledge and their mechanism is so often concerned with the short-time supply and demand situation, that they are, perhaps, even more ignorant of the long-time play of supply and demand forces than most farmers.One thing which disturbs me exceedingly about the people of the United States, whether they be conservative grain dealers, Left-Wing farmers or labour leaders, is the way in which they jump at conclusions on insufficient grounds. As one example, take the recent interpretation placed on my views on inflation. For a number of years prior to the 4th March, 1933, I urged the stabilisation of the purchasing power of the dollar and a restoration of the commodity price-level to that which prevailed in 1926. In those years, folks in the East considered me a wild inflationist. Since the 4th March it has been my pleasure to see the objectives we strove for out in the Middle West become a basic principle in President roosevelt&apos;s programme for recovery. In fact, as you all know, steps have already been taken to promote a restoration of the honest dollar or, as the President put it on the 7th May : &apos;&apos; The Administration has the definite objective of raising commodity prices to such  in extent that those who have borrowed money will, on the average, be able to repay that money in the same kind of dollar which they borrowed.&quot; In view of the progress already made in that direction, it was deemed opportune to explain to farmers what some of the results might be, especially to point out that if the previous price level is restored farmers would still face the continued necessity of balacing farm output more nearly in line with demand conditions. Unfortunately, this attempt to clarify the farmer&apos;s thinking, lest he be disappointed, when the price-level objectives are eventually attained, has given rise to the mistaken impression that I have changed my views. My position with respect to controlled inflation has not changed. At the same time I shall continue to point out what action farmers will need to take in order to prevent distortions of productive forces which may later rise to plague us. Please remember that inflation is not a cure-all, and that when it stops, as sooner or later it must, we will again discover that our problem is one of achieving balance.
Another example of misunderstanding and misinterpretation bearing more directly oh the theme of this talk is the relation of overproduction as a factor in bringing on the depression. Since 1926 the world has become sick increasingly, at first without realising it. By 1927 the stocks of speculative raw materials, which move in world commerce, increased to 25 per cent, above what had been normal. By 1929 further increase had taken place to 40 per cent, above normal, and in 1931 they were twice the normal. To-day they are still more than twice normal. From 1927 to 1933 all the nations of the world have engaged in price protection efforts which have served to increase stocks rather than to cut them down. In the United States alone have we gone directly at the problem of cutting down the supplies of such basic commodities as wheat and cotton. Ploughing under 10 million acres of cotton and the slaughter of 5 million little pigs would rightfully have been called insane in the pre-war world when the United States was a debtor nation. But in view of the fact that the United States is now a creditor nation with a high tariff, that she is trying to deal with other nations with high tariffs, and that all of these nations with their barriers have succeeded in building up twice the normal stocks of fundamental raw materials, it would seem the part of wisdom for American farmers to stop adding to the world surplus.It is interesting to ask whether the increase in stocks which took place after 1926 was due to overproduction or underconsumption. In the case of cotton, the 1926 record cotton crop beyond the current capacity of domestic and foreign mills piled up stocks in 1927. In the case of wheat, upward trends in production, culminating in the record crop of 1928, laid the basis for the mounting surpluses of recent years. Coffee stocks began to pile up during 1927 and 1928, and stocks of sugar and rubber began to mount with the large output of 1925 and 1926. Thus, the origin of the commodity surplus problem, since it is traceable to prosperity years, indicates uncontrolled, unco-ordinated overproduction as an originating cause of present difficulties.As a matter of fact, a closer perusal of the facts leads me to the conclusion that it was overproduction in basic commodities and a piling up of stocks that led the way into this major depression, and that underconsumption lifted those surpluses to still higher levels. By 1927 and 1928 world stocks of nine international foods and raw materials averaged 45 per cent, higher than in 1923-25, and the prices of these same commodities declined about 20 per cent. By 1929, even in the midst of that industrial boom, commodity stocks piled up another 15 per cent., and prices sank another 5 per cent, in the face of high purchasing power. From then on surpluses continued to pile up as unrestrained output was pressed upon markets unable to buy.I fear most of the people of the United States are still kidding themselves. They do not like to face the fact that effective foreign purchasing power for our surplus wheat, cotton, lard and tobacco has largely disappeared. If anyone reminds them that the stocks of fundamental raw materials are still more than twice the normal, they begin to throw bricks. In this respect Left-Wing farmers and Right-Wing grain dealers are astonishingly alike. Until the people of the United States are willing to hear the truth and plan accordingly, there can be no hope. At the present time we are still dodging the fact that we are a creditor nation, that we have high tariffs, that we have 40 million surplus acres of crop land for which there is no effective market, either at home or abroad, and that there are still twice the normal supplies of the fundamental commodities which move in world trade.I have sympathy with the optimistic business boomer, who is now trying to move things off dead centre, and certainly with the suffering farmer who is now asking for price-fixing and inflation. But I also know that neither of these gentlemen can bring about any cure which will last very long unless account is taken of these fundamental things I have just mentioned. While it does not necessarily follow, there is danger that optimism, price-fixing and inflation will all of them tend to increase, rather than reduce, the lack of balance resulting from our creditor position, our high tariffs, our surplus acres and our excess stocks of fundamental goods.What already has been done, constitutes, I think, some real progress of a fundamental sort. But we in Washington are keenly aware it is no time to focus attention upon moderate successes thus far attained.It is true that these accomplishments, unimpressive though they now may
seem, may in the future prove historically important as the guide to a changed pattern for a basic industry and the incentive to hopes and efforts that led to a better day.But the outstanding fact to-day, which should not and must not be evaded, is that the greatest problems of agriculture have not been solved. Acute distress exists in the farm country. Farm folks still are suffering from the chronic ailment of low prices for what they sell. Agricultural purchasing power has not yet been restored to those levels it must reach before the nation can regain economic stability. To deny the facts would be evidence of a lack of courage and honesty with ourselves.Whether we like it or not, what we must reckon with now is the cumulative effect of long-continued distress in agriculture. When an emergency exists the thing to do is to face it.The need to establish farm income on a higher level is so clear as to challenge all who have any responsibility for action.That challenge dictates a sympathetic re-examination of every remedy and each device, including those which orthodox economists would reject impatiently.Too many examples of fixed prices are familiar to permit ready and complete dismissal of proposals to settle the farm problem by fiat. The physician treating your sick child sends a bill based on charges fixed by the Medical Association, not by free competition though to be sure the doctor only gets part payment and sometimes no payment in return. The freight charges deducted from the farmer&apos;s grain price are fixed by Government edict.. It sometimes seems that until the Government steps in, every important agency for handling agricultural produce from farm to table has more to say about the price than the farmer has. Rates of gas, light, and street car fares are fixed. Consumers long since have learned to pay regulated prices for water, and we seem slowly to be moving towards the public-utility method of regulating prices of milk.The point is that there are instances of fixed-price schedules. In a situation so acute it is proper to scrutinise them. We must put aside bias and open our eyes to see all the facts. There must be clear-sighted vision of both the immediate advantages of every course, and also of the ultimate, attendant dangers. Mono-poly, public or private, is the normal counterpart of price-fixing. Maintaining rates of pay for services is simple compared to the task of fixing and sustaining-prices of goods which can be produced abundantly.When pondering these things, however, it is wise to remember that each commodity is a law unto itself. Methods can be tried for some which could not possibly work for others. There should be willingness to survey the problems of every product and to employ policies prudently adapted to each one, without stiff-necked adherence to the fallacies of glib generalisations.Waving of wands will not suffice to dissipate real economic problems. We do not attain economic improvement by the use of sorcery. The farm prices, which are much improved this year, are those for which reductions of supply are present or prospective including grains, potatoes and cotton. It appears that though price-pegging may have its uses, resort to price-fixing without control of supply is fraught with danger.It is time for the people of the United States to begin to think deeply instead of superficially. The men of the grain trade have learned to think accurately in terms of a short time supply and demand situation. I am sure they can also think accurately in terms of a long time supply and demand situation which spreads over the years instead of over the days. There is no money in it for them right now, but there will be satisfaction in it for their children and grandchildren. I do not defend the Agricultural Adjustment Act as the last word in wisdom. In view of the mess we have gotten into in the past twelve years, I think the Agricultural Adjustment Act has and is helping us to bridge over a difficult situation, especially in cotton and wheat. Efforts of this sort may be necessary for several years, until we have either opened up very large foreign markets by an appropriate tariff policy or until we have started on a really statesmanlike land policy. I sincerely trust that the day will come when the 50 million poorer acres of plough land in the United States will be retired from use. The men on these poorer acres in south-eastern United States and certain parts of the arid west have been bucking an impossible situation. Their plough land might wrell be turned to grass or trees and they themselves given an opportunity either to)
farm in more favourable sections or to engage in decentralised industrial enter-prises. These things cannot be worked out rapidly, but they will have to come either as a result of planning or as a result of blood and misery. It will not be easy in any case. Frankly, I believe that civilisation demands planning and that that result was practically foreordained as an outcome of the tremendously dislocating forces set in motion by the World War.Great is the present need to restore jobs to millions, great is the need to restore decent prices to farmers, greater still, for the success of recovery depends upon it, is the need to awaken the American consciousness to the broader point. Would that in the midst of our current efforts there arose a messenger so clear as to burn this understanding unforgetably into the mind of America.
