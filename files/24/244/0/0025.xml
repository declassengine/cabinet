[THIS SOCTTTIEI-TT IS TEZ PROPERTY OF HIS BRITAZTRTC MAJESTYTS C-OVSW-EHT) .;chet - - &apos; &apos; . \,p&quot;. 2 75(55) CABINET.WATER SUPPLY IT-T RITRAL AREAS *\ /COPY I\TQ. . .Memorandum &quot;by Minister of Health.1. &apos;   The improvement of rural water supplies is ene of the most pressing problems in local government.      While substantial progress has been made in the matter since the war, there are still many villages with inadequate ar polluted supplies.      The conditions in some villages are deplorable. There are grave rislcs to health and decent cleanliness cannot be maint allied.      The rising standards cf life have rendered intolerable conditions which have been endured in the past,  and during recent years there has been a marked increase of discontent and an agitation which is growing.      During the last year Members representing rural areas have frequently raised th subject in the House and not without cause.      The dry summer brought serious hardship to a large number of villages,  and though the drought was exceptional;   it but brought to a head conditions which are chronic in many of them.      The provision of good water supplies would also help dairy farmers.2.      Rural District Councils are responsible for rural water supplies,  but any charge on the rates falls primarily on the benefiting parish.      Cost is the principal obstacle to improvement, because necessary expediture   usually far -exceeds the revenue which can be obtained.      Frequently, what the consumer can.pay is little more than enough to meet maintenance charges,  and the loan charges fall to be met out of the.rates. If the deficiency were to be met wholly out of the parish rates, a rate--in-aid of 3/- to 4/- would commonly be unavoidable,  and in many instances even more.
The Local Government Act of 1929 enabled   Rural District Councils and County Councils to contribute out of their general funds towards the cost of parochial schemes, thus relieving the burden on the parish rates,    I have urged the full vise of these powers on both classes of Authorities and much has already been done by them.    But it Is abundantly clear that, even with assistance from both, these sources, there are many places which cannot be supplied without additiona 1 aid.3.   Unemployment grants were available for rural water schemes,  on exceptionally favourable terms in the latter part of the period of their currency, and many rural schemes which would otherwise not have been possible were undertakenI am convinced that In many rural parishes It is not practicable to obtain a decent water supply unless some Government help is forthcoming, and I am further convinced that this help is fully warranted by the urgency of the need and the weakness of local resources .    I have had a careful estimate made and am of opinion that if I were provided with a sum. of  1,000,000 the problem in England and Wales could substantially be met.     The money would be distributed in grants to places where I was satisfied that there was a clear need for assistance, and that what was required could not be obtained without help;    and only on condition, not only that the local consumers but also the local parochial ratepayers bore their fair share and, further, after the maximum contributions which can reasonably be expected under the Local Government Act of 1929 have been secured from other authorities .The preparation,, approval and execution of schemes would necessarily take a good, deal of time, certainly not less than three years, probably longer, and I estimate thatThe loans sanctioned for rural schemes rose from  130,000 in 1928/9 to  420,000 in 1929/30,  580,000 in the next year and nearly  920,000 In 1931/2, falling to    300,000 in 1932/5,  and this last sum Included    some schemes for which grants had previously boon promised.
the charge on the Exchequer for the first year would not he more than about  200,000.      If considered desirable, the grant could be made not in the form of a capital sum but in payments towards annual loan charges  (the period usually granted for a scheme of water supply is 30 years) ,   but the total sum is relatively so small that it would probably be better to make the grant as a capital sum.    I think its greater intelligibility also recommends the form of a capital grant.4.    The proposed outlay would earn more than it cost in actual and practical values, not only in health and amenity, but In industrial facilities,  and in saving labour.    It would, I believe, be a profitable Investment,  that would increase wealth on balance.5.      The Chancellor of the Exchequer concurs with me In. the above proposals and I submit them for the approval of the Cabinet.     Legislation will be required but it should not be controversial and I should hope that time can be found for it next session,  though the negotiations had not proceeded far enough to enable me  to include it in the Ministry of Health programme.(Intlcl.)    E.H.Y.16th Hovember, 1933.
