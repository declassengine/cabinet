this document is the property of his britannic majesty&apos;s governmentPrinted for the Cabinet.  November 1933.SECRET. Copy NqCP. 256 (33).CABINET.St. DUNSTAN&apos;S, REGENT&apos;S PARK.Proposed Extension of Lease. Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.St. DUNSTAN&apos;S is a large house, built in 1826, with grounds of 12a. 2ri lip., within the circumference of Regent&apos;s Park. It is held on lease from the Commissioners of Crown Lands at a rent of  540 per annum. The lease has forty years to run from the 5th April next.Lord Rothermere has recently purchased the lease for  21,700 and proposes to demolish the existing house, which is out of date and dilapidated, to build a new house at an estimated cost of  60,000, and to spend a large additional sum on the garden. He asks for an extension of lease in consideration of this proposed outlay on the improvement of the property.A private landlord would unquestionably accede to Lord Rothermere&apos;s request, but before the Commissioners of Crown Lands proceed with negotiations I must ask for a ruling of the Cabinet on the question whether, and to what extent, this case is governed by the Cabinet Minute dated the 23rd May, 1928, viz. : &quot; That the general policy should be to aim at gradually bringing to an end the enclosures in the Public Parks, and that the First Commissioner of Works should take steps necessary, as leases fall in, to give effect to this policy, in consultation with the other Government Departments concerned.&quot;In this connection I submit, for the consideration of my colleagues, the following points : (1) The rent under an extended lease would certainly be increased, and therefore it would be to the advantage of the Exchequer. In 1928 financial considerations were entirely disregarded by the Cabinet, but in the conditions prevailing to-day a different view might well be taken.(2) If an extended lease is not granted the public will gain nothing at all for more than forty years.(3) I should propose, in negotiating with Lord Rothermere, to stipulate in consideration of an extended lease that he should forthwith relinquish not less than three acres of the grounds, to be added to Regent&apos;s Park and made available for the public use. Such an arrangement would, I feel, be more in accordance with the policy expressed in the Cabinet Minute than to refuse to extend the Lease.I should be glad therefore to have the authority of the Cabinet to negotiate with Lord Rothermere for the grant of a Lease for not more than eighty years, subject to the condition mentioned in (3) above.(Initialled)   W.  E. E.Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, November 3, 1933.[9240]
