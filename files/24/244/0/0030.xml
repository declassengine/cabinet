November 8, 1933.CONFIDENTIAL. Section 7.[C 9752/255/22] No. 1./Sir 2?. Drummond to Sir John Simon. (Received November 8.) (No. 847.   Confidential.)Sir, Rome, November 4, 1933.IN your despatch No. 880 of the 17th October you asked Sir R. Graham whether the views expressed in his despatch No. 109 of the 17th February, to the effect that the Italian Government were unlikely to impose restrictive measures on British coal since to do so would damage their own interests as much as those of the United Kingdom, still held good, and you asked him to supply you with a general report on the whole question of German competition in the Italian coal trade.2. It will perhaps be as well to examine, first, the situation as regards recent German competition, which has certainly made inroads into the dominant position hitherto held by the British coal trade in this market, particularly in regard to supplies for the Italian State Railways; then to examine in such detail as is possible the causes which have led to the decrease in supplies of British coal; and, finally, to deduce from the facts before us what lessons one can for the future. In the course of this examination the answer to the question regarding restrictive measures contained in the despatch under reply will, I believe, make itself reasonably clear.3. For many years the United Kingdom has supplied by far the greater proportion of the coal imported into Italy. The actual percentages for the years 1927-32, inclusive, are as follows : Percentage. Percentage.1927        ...         ...       46 1930 ... ... 571928         ...          .:.        52 1931 ... ... 56-21929         ...          ...        51 1932 ... ... 65-it will be seen that, speaking generally, the proportion of British coal imported by Italy has been rising steadily in the last six years. For 1933 figures for the first seven months only are at present available and will be found in the enclosure to this despatch. They show that the United Kingdom share of the coal imports into Italy for these seven months was 57 - 8 per cent., or a decrease on the previous year of 7-5 per cent. Nevertheless, from the above figures it will be seen that the percentage of United Kingdom coal imports, though admittedly less than last year, still exceeds the figures for the years 1927-29 inclusive. In other words, the United Kingdom, though still far ahead of all countries, has begun to lose relatively, though her imports have not yet dropped to the figures of three or four years ago.4. An examination of the statistics given in the appendix shows that the Italian demand for coal remains steady. Indeed, 50,000 tons more coal was imported during the first seven months of this year than in the corresponding period of last year. The loss to the United Kingdom coal exporters represented by the 7-5 per cent, decrease has been gained by Germany, whose share in the market has increased in 1933 as compared with 1932 by 1 - 5 per cent.; by Poland, whose share has gone up by 1-6 per cent.; by Russia, 1 - 9 per cent.; and by the Netherlands, who, for the purposes of this despatch may, generally speaking, be assimilated with Germany, by 1 - 9 per cent. &apos;&apos; German-Dutch &apos;&apos; coal has, in fact, gained almost half of the loss which British coal has experienced.5. In his confidential despatch No. 564 of the 29th July, my predecessor explained some of the causes which contributed to swell the German percentage of coal imports to Italy. It will be recalled that one at least of the reasons which induced the Italian State Railways to place orders with Germany was because facilities had been granted by the German Government, designed to increase the German tourist traffic to this country. Further information has [977 h-7] b
since reached me which seems to prove quite definitely that the purchasing depart-ment of the Italian State Railways no longer place their orders solely oh commercial and technical grounds, but are actuated by politico-economic considerations. Thus my commercial counsellor informs me that in the early part of the current year it was understood that the railways would, during the ensuing months, be in the market for approximately 1 million tons, and orders for several cargoes presumably to be regarded as sample cargoes were in fact placed in South Wales by the Cardiff offices of the Italian State Railways. It appears, however, that about .the same time the German Ambassador called at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, enquiring whether the State Railways could not place orders for German coal, adding that, in return for such orders, Germany would be prepared to consider any suggestions that might be put forward by Italy for concessions which would benefit her economically. Either just before or very shortly after Herr von Hassel&apos;s demarche, it seems that the Italian State Railways Were informed by higher authority that purchases of fuel for the railways were in future only to be made from markets which were prepared to offer Italy some tangible advantage in return. I learn, indeed, from a sure source that Comm. Nobile, the head of the purchasing department of the Italian State Railways, has recently stated that the purchase of coal for the railways is no longer a commercial and technical operation, but a political one, and that the initiative in regard to such purchases has been transferred from the Railway Administration to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Corporations. However this may be, and I have no reason to suppose that Comm. Nobile was not speaking the truth, the actual results of the negotiations initiated by the German Ambassador in March were that a series of contracts for, it is estimated, a total of 350,000 tons were placed in Germany, while it seems possible that more recently a supplementary contract for an unspecified amount has also been placed in that country. The main inducement for these contracts has been, I believe, the undertaking by the German Government to facilitate the German tourist traffic to this country. There are some reasons to suppose that further negotiations are proceeding with the Germans for coal, but it is perhaps doubtful whether, despite the invisible revenue represented by the increased tourist traffic, Italy will find it to her advantage to increase further her adverse trade balance with Germany, which, as will be seen from the enclosure to this despatch, amounted to 222 million lire for the first seven months of 1932.6. As regards purchases of Polish coal by Italy, an agreement of one year&apos;s duration, which has now come to an end, provided for the purchase of this coal in exchange for imports by Poland of tobacco from the Italian State monopolies. Quite recently, however, negotiations, which are still proceeding, have been under-taken between groups of industrialists in the two countries under which in exchange for the purchase by Italy of coal and steel in Poland, the latter country is to place orders for two passenger-carrying vessels of 10,000 to 15,000 tons in the Montfalcone shipyards in this country. These ships, it is understood, are destined for service in the Baltic until such time as the North Atlantic shipping position improves. Negotiations for a commercial treaty between Italy and Poland were unsuccessful last January. I understand, however, that the Polish Government have now enacted a new tariff based on three categories of treatment, viz., most-favoured-nation, medium and inferior treatment, the results of which will, so the Polish Government hope, make the Italians easier to deal with in negotiations for a commercial treaty which would redress the balance of trade. This is at present heavily in favour of Italy the figures for the last two years (first seven months only) being as follows : 7. I have little reliable information regarding the reasons for the increase in the Russian share of the Italian coal import trade. All that can be said is that the coal imported has mostly been anthracite, that it is technically suitable for certain purposes, and that not only do the Russians maintain a very efficient selling organisation in Genoa, but that they have also instituted a system of sending out experts to show how best their anthracite fuel can be made use of. Generally speaking, too, as we know, the Italians are anxious to obtain suppliesExports to Poland Imports from Poland ...1933. 53,000,915 33,301,8021932. 54,139,262 52,818,71619,699,1131,320,546
and to open up channels of trade to the East, for such lines of communication might prove less liable to interruption in times of war than those from the north and west.8. The above information is by no means as detailed as could be wished, and contains a large proportion of second-hand evidence. Nevertheless, it seems-sufficient to permit of the deduction that Italian commercial policy is undergoing&apos; as is the policy of many if not most countries to-day, certain modifications. It might reasonably be held that hitherto Italy, dependent as she is for almost all her raw materials on foreign sources of supply, has generally been in favour of a lowering of barriers to trade : her inclinations have, in fact, been in the direction of free trade, though on strategical as much as economic grounds she has striven to lessen her dependence on the foreigner. Where she has had to purchase in outside markets, she has done so mainly, if not entirely, on the principle of buying in those markets which give her the best value for her money on strictly economic lines. Comm. Nobile has now stated that as regards coal, at least her purchases will be made on wider grounds than those of pure economy. What she, in common with so many Governments to-day, no doubt wishes to do is to use her purchasing power as a means (if not a threat) to induce * other countries to purchase from her. The policy is, of course, no new one, but the economic crisis has, without doubt, enhanced its attraction for Italy as for other countries. This interpretation of Italian policy is supported by the&quot; case of the Italo-South African Shipping Agreement, which formed the subject of a recent despatch addressed to my predecessor (Foreign Office despatch No. 867 of the 12th October). The slightly unsavoury story of M. Fourie and Signor Labia . shows clearly enough that Italy wishes to buy from those who are ready to make concessions to her. The recently concluded Italo-Argentine Commercial Agree-. ment seems to point the same moral. Meanwhile, as coal represents one of the largest items in the Italian Import Bill, naturally, coal forms one of Rome&apos;s strongest bargaining counters.9. Granted, then, that do ut des is now, in fact, the policy of the Italian Government, how can we best safeguard the interests of British coal exporters % We have, as Sir R. Graham pointed out in his despatch No. 109 of the 17th February, certain natural advantages. The South Wales coal-fields supply a type of coal which is much in demand in this country, and it seems certain that the Italian State Railways, if left to themselves, would purchase Welsh coal in preference to any other. The railways&apos; stocks are at the present moment very much lower than the level considered, I gather, suitable by the military authorities at least (say 600,000 to 800,000 tons, instead of 1^ millions, leaving out briquettes). It is believed that both German and Polish coal is unsuitable for stocking purposes, not only on account of its gaseous nature and its susceptibility to spontaneous combustion, but also because it is considered too friable. More-over, as pointed out in Sir R. Graham&apos;s. above-mentioned despatch, prices are, generally speaking, quality for quality in favour of Welsh coal.. But though we retain these natural advantages, it seems clear that unless we are to offer some further concrete and immediate advantages to Italian economy as a whole, we are likely to continue to see our imports, and in particular our sales to the Italian State Railways, dwindle in favour of these competitors who are ready to meet Italian wishes in this regard. It is not that definite restrictive measures againsu British coal of the type considered in my predecessor^ despatch under reference are likely to be imposed, but that our imports will naturally dwindle as increasing orders are placed with competitors, who, from the Italian point of view, show themselves more accommodating. The means employed are, indeed, different from those hitherto considered, but the effect on the South Wales coalfields will be unfortunately the same.10. If the above reasoning is sound, it seems necessary, in order to preserve our coal trade, to examine with great care the possible concessions we could make in favour of Italian exports to the United Kingdom. A list of such concessions was enclosed in a Board of Trade letter of the 7th January last, enclosed in a semi-official letter from the Foreign Office dated the 16th January,. 1933. But my commercial counsellor informs me that, in his opinion, there can be little doubt that what the Italian Government really desire is a new commercial agreement with the United Kingdom, and that they hope to use the coal lever&apos; in order to obtain their desiderata, even if, as may well.be the case, they have as yet no very definite concessions in mind. An observation which the Under-[977 h-7] b 2
Secretary in the Ministry of Communications recently made to a member of my staff is not without significance. Signor Asquini in fact observed, a propos of the slump in the Carrara marble trade : &quot; How can you expect me to buy your coal when you go and impose heavy duties on our marble, and even encourage parsons in England to urge their parishioners to use local material for tomb-stones ?  Buy our marble as you used to do and I will buy your coal.&quot;11. If this really represents the official point of view of the Italian Govern-ment, it would seem necessary for His Majesty&apos;s Government to make up their mind as to whether they should anticipate the further use of the coal lever by themselves suggesting commercial discussions, or whether they would be better advised to wait and see what specific move, if any, is made by the Italian Government.12.
