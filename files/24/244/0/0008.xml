Copy No. $5CP. 258 (33).CABINET.THE POSITION IN THE IRISH FREE STATE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.MY colleagues will probably like to have some account of recent developments in the Irish Free State as exemplified by the three Bills which Mr. de Valera has recently introduced for the amendment of the Irish Free State Constitution. The text of the Bills is annexed (Appendices I, II and III).2.   Briefly the Bills provide for (1) the substitution, in connection with appropriations of money, of the recommendation of the &quot; Executive Council signed by the President of the Council &quot; for the recommendation of the &quot; Representative of the Crown acting on the advice of the Executive Council.&quot;(2) the removal of provisions which in terms set out the power of the Representative of the Crown to withhold the King&apos;s assent to a Bill or to reserve the Bill for the signification of the King&apos;s pleasure.(3) the abolition of the right of appeal to His Majesty in Council.8. The legal- aspect of these Bills has been considered by the Attorney-General, whose opinion is annexed (Appendix IV). Briefly, his view is that Bills (1) and (3) are repugnant to the Treaty of 1921, but that Bill (2) is not so repugnant. So far as Bill (3) is concerned, His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom have throughout maintained the view that the abolition of the appeal to the Judicial Committee by the Irish Free State without the consent of the United Kingdom would be a breach of the Treaty. This view wras expressed in Parliament in debates on the Treaty and Constitution in 1921 and 1922; again in 1926, on the occasion of the passage by the Irish Free State of legislation to forestall, in a particular case, an appeal to the Judicial Committee, the then Lord Chancellor (Lord Cave see House of Lords Official Reports, the 3rd March, 1926) used the following language : &quot; If indeed this process were repeated so as to show an intention by a succession of Statutes to destroy the existing right of appeal to the Privy Council, a different condition of affairs would arise : but, as things stand &apos;;to-day, I decline to believe that it is the intention of the Free State so to depart from its obligations.&quot;4. The Attorney-General points out, however, that as regards Bill (3) the arguments by which we should maintain that the abolition of the appeal to the Judicial Committee is a violation of the Treaty will not receive any support from Irish Free State opinion generally, it was indeed clear from the attitude which Mr. Cosgrave&apos;s Government took up at the Imperial Conference of 1930 that his supporters would have no option but to range themselves with the de Valera party on this issue. Indeed, it will be remembered that shortly after the Conference, and some time before the Cosgrave Government was defeated in 1932, they had announced their intention of introducing legislation to abolish the appeal, although the legislation was never actually introduced. Our position is that the retention of the appeal, though not explicit in the Treaty, was never-[9233] b
theless implicit, by reason of Article 2 of the Treaty which imposed on the Irish Free State the law practice and constitutional usage of Canada; and that this must be interpreted by reference to the powers possessed by Canada in these respects in 1921, not (as the Irish Free State maintained) by reference to the powers&quot; possessed by Canada from time to time. The United Kingdom repre-sentatxves at the Treaty settlement made clear their view both in Parliament and outside that the right of appeal was a recognised part of the Treaty settlement and was protected by the Treaty; successive British Governments have maintained the same point of view.5.   As regard Bill (1) similar arguments and similar considerations apply.6. The view that the Bills would not meet with serious opposition in the Irish Free State has now been confirmed by the course of discussion in the Dail and Senate. The Bills passed both Houses with practically no opposition and with the addition in the Senate of a clause making Bill (3) retrospective in order to nullify the appeal to the Privy Council now pending in the Lough Erne case. In the Dail Mr. McDermot stated as regards Bill (1) that the Bill would meet with no objection from his party. It did not appear that it conflicted with any Treaty obligations or honourable settlements of any sort. He further observed that the Bills &quot;were trivial and could not excite the smallest enthusiasm in anybody.&quot; On the final stages of the Bills two ex-Unionist members opposed Bill (3) on the basis that retention of the appeal to the Judicial &quot;Committee was part of the bargain made with the Unionists in 1922; a similar point &quot;was made by Sir John Keane in the Senate. (On this point it may be said that there is nothing on record in the Dominions Office to show that any such bargain was made between the Southern Unionists and the Irish Free State representatives at the Treaty discussions, though, as indicated above, the views of the United Kingdom representatives were made clear). Mr. de &quot;Valera observed that if any bargains stood in the way of their sovereignty those bargains would have to go.7. On the other hand, the intention and real significance of the Bills is clear. It is to make the King&apos;s Representative, so far as possible, a nonentity and to assimilate the form of Government, little by little, to a Republic.8. We shall no doubt be called upon, when Parliament meets, to define our attitude to these Bills, and the question therefore is, what line had we best adopt.9. &quot;We can say, at any rate as regards two of the Bills, that we are advised that they are repugnant to the Treaty. As I have said above, we are unlikely to receive any support from Irish Free State opinion in this; but I expect my colleagues will agree that we ought not to allow this to deter us from making our views clear, though I suggest that it would be better not to lay too much stress on the legal aspect of the matter since that would not bring out what is to my mind the real significance of the Bills.10. In considering the question, we must also, I think, bear in mind Mr. de Valera&apos;s general attitude, as shown, for example, in the treatment accorded by him both to the late Governor-General and to his own nominee, the present Governor-General (who is apparently forbidden to appear at any public function, such as the Dublin Horse Show), and in his speeches.. Perhaps the clearest statement of his position is to be found in the following extract from a statement made by him in the Dail on the 3rd May last, when the Oath Bill was finally passed : &apos;&apos; As far as we are concerned, the Irish people will be consulted before a Republic is declared. The Articles there which we believe not to be required by the Treaty will go first, and there are some just as in the case of the Oath-where, if it is necessary to go to the Irish people to get rid of the Treaty in order to get them removed, we will do that, but go they all will. As I said, I still hope to see the day when I will have the pleasure as I had to-day of removing the Oath of taking the whole batch and finally ending up by declaring a Republic.&quot;11. It is therefore for consideration whether it would not be wiser to take our main stand not on the purely legal question of repugnance to the Treaty, but on the.broader ground that these Bills can only be regarded as significant of an intention to eliminate the Crown from the Constitution of the Irish Free State.
If this is agreed, I would propose that we should make our position clear by a statement as follows : &quot;We are advised that the legislation conflicts in important respects with the Treaty of 1921, and its passage therefore involves a further repudiation of the obligations entered into by the Irish Free State under that Treaty. We have already made perfectly clear the view which we take of action of this kind. Quite apart from any question of legality, we look upon it as a repudiation of an honourable settlement. No modification of the Treaty can properly be made except by agreement between the two, countries.But that&apos; is not the only aspect of the matter.The real significance of the Bills is that they clearly indicate an intention gradually to eliminate the Crown from the Constitution of the Irish Free State.Mr. de Valera has told us (as I said in the House of Commons on the 17th June, 1932) that his ultimate aim is the recognition of a United Ireland as a republic with some form of association with the British Commonwealth in some circumstances and for some reasons and the recognition of the King-as the head of the association.That is an idea to which His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom will in no circumstances agree. Any attempt therefore to reach this end by stages is certain to fail.&quot;Our view can be clearly stated. The Declaration of the Imperial Conference of 1926 as to the relationship of Great Britain and the Dominions under the Crown must be accepted as the basis of the constitutional position of the Irish Free State within the Empire.That Declaration is clearly inconsistent with a state of things under which the Irish Free State would be a member of the British Commonwealth of Nations for some purposes and not for all, and would cease to be united with Great Britain and the Dominions by a common allegiance to the Crown.&quot;12. I think, if my colleagues agree, that it might be well to give also a more positive indication of our attitude and for this purpose to add something on the following lines : &apos;&apos; Our conception of membership of the British Commonwealth is something entirely different. The Irish Free State as a member of that Commonwealth is, as Mr. de Valera himself must now have learned, completely free to order her own affairs. Membership of the Commonwealth confers great advantages, which by her own action the Irish Free State is tending to lose; the privileges of common citizenship, economic advantages in trading with the rest of the Empire, and the opportunity of powerful influence in international affairs, in concert with the other members of the Commonwealth, in the cause of world peace.Those privileges carry with them responsibilities, respect for the Crown, loyal observance of engagements, the spirit of friendship and co-operation with the other members of the British Commonwealth. It is our desire to see the Irish Free State taking her full part as a member of the Commonwealth, not grudgingly, but of her own free.will, accepting the responsibilities and enjoying the privileges. If she renounce the one, she cannot hope to enjoy the other.&quot;13. Naturally, one would have liked to be able to propose some stronger action, but I doubt whether the time has yet come when we ought to modify our general policy in relation to the Irish Free State, which has so far been to make no move that could be construed as an effort to drive the Irish Free State out of the British Commonwealth. Though it is the unexpected that always happens in Ireland, my own view is that events there are moving to an internal crisis.J. H. T.Dominions Offi.ce, November 1933.[92331

This Act may be cited as the Constitution (Amendment No. 22) Act, 1933.APPENDIX IV.Royal Courts of Justice, London.THE three Bills which have been introduced in the Dail for the amend-ent of certain Articles in the Constitution have one common feature. They all ach the position of the Sovereign in some way or other, and it seems certain at two of them, if not all three, are designed with the express purpose of osening the attachment of the Irish Free State to the Sovereign.The first of the three Bills proposes to amend Article 37 by substituting in nnection with appropriations of money the recommendation of the &quot; Executive auncil signed by the President of the Council&quot; for the recommendation of the Representative of the Crown acting on the advice of the Executive Council.&quot;The second Bill proposes to cut out from Article 41 the provisions with gard to the power of the Representative of the Crown to withhold the King&apos;s sent to a Bill, or to reserve the Bill for the signification of the King&apos;s pleasure.The third Bill is for the abolition of the right of appeal to His Majesty in mncil. In order to effect this, Article 66 is to be amended by the omission of e proviso which preserves the right of any person to petition His Majesty for Special leave to appeal and by the insertion of words prohibiting any such appeal.The practical effect of the first two of these Bills, if passed, would be very tall so far as the working of the Legislature is concerned. There can hardly any difference in a Dominion between a message from the Governor-General ting on the advice of the Executive and a message from the Executive recom-ending the appropriation of money. The significance, therefore, of the Bill ust be somewhere else. In connection with the appointment of a successor to r. MacNeill, I had little doubt that the provisions requiring the intervention the Representative of the Crown in the machinery of the Legislature would oner or later compel Mr. de Valera to recommend someone to the King to fillAmendment of Article 66 of the Constitu-tion.Short title.
the position. The proposed amendment of Article 37 removes one difficulty in the path of anyone desiring to get rid of any connection with the Crown. There are other Articles which maintain the constitutional position of the King : Article 41 is an illustration, but the others all seem to me of comparatively minor importance, and not to present any very formidable obstacles to the attainment of the Republican ideal by due forms of law. Article 37 touches the power of the purse, and so long as it remains unamended there must be a Representative of the Crown.But, whatever the intention behind the Bill may be, there is no doubt, in my opinion, that the Bill is repugnant to Article 2 of the Treaty. The further question then arises whether, if it is so repugnant, the Bill, when passed, will be &apos;&apos; void and inoperative,&apos;&apos; in which case the voting of money under its provisions would be illegal. In this connection Section 2 of the Statute of Westminster requires consideration. In my view, Section 2 would not touch the Bill in question, my reason being that it is the constituent Act of the Irish Free State itself which makes the Treaty decisive and final, and not any Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom.It is obvious, however, that this question is very technical and difficult. If it is decided to address any protest to the Irish Free State, I think it will be advisable, at this stage at any rate, to rest upon the plain breach of the Treaty involved in the Bill to amend Article 37. .The second Bill, dealing with the power of the Representative of the Crown as to withholding the King&apos;s assent to a Bill, is not, in my opinion, repugnant to the Treaty. The requirement of the King&apos;s assent to be signified by the Representative of the Crown is left unaltered, though it is plain that, with a complaisant Governor-General, as the present one is, the King&apos;s assent is the barest formality, and would present no difficulty to Mr. de Valera in the final step. This, however, is not, in my opinion, a ground for saying that the Bill is repugnant to the Treaty. The practice and constitutional usage of Canada has for many years been such as in effect to get rid of the right to withhold the King&apos;s assent Or to reserve a Bill for the signification of His pleasure. Since the Statute of Westminster, moreover, reasons for withholding assent are likely to occur very rarely indeed, if ever. On these grounds I am of opinion that no real objection from a strictly legal point of view can be taken to the present Bill. The significance of the Bill, however, remains. The Bill for the abolition of the right of appeal to the Privy Council is clearly, in my opinion, a breach of the Treaty. This view has been so often and clearly expressed by others that I need not elaborate it. In view of the attitude of Mr. Cosgrave&apos;s Government to this proposal, it is probable that Irish Legal opinion will generally take the ground that the Statute of Westminster permits the alteration to be made. I do not take this view. I am informed that there are two or three Petitions in preparation asking for special leave to appeal to the Privy Council, which it is. hoped may be heard before the Bill in question is passed. There seems, therefore, to be some body of opinion in Ireland disposed to maintain the right of appeal, and on the whole I think the Irish Free State should be informed that the Bill is regarded as a breach of the Treaty.It is not within my province to consider whether any action beyond a protest ought not now or very soon to be considered in view of the plain design to weaken the connection with the Crown.(Signed) T. W. H. INSKIP.September 21, 1933.
