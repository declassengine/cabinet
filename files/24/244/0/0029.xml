^HIS DOCUMENT 13 THE PROPERTY Off RT: BRITANMIO MAJBBTYTB aoTOPJWllNT.&apos; &apos; D OSECRET. COPY NO.CP. 279(33) . 215CABINET.MINERAL RIGHTS IN PETROLEUM IN GREAT BRITAIN. Memorandum by the President of the Bonrd of Trede.1.    I pm sorry to h^ve to trouble my coliefiguee once pgoln with the question of petroleum production in this country.    The position has recently been entirely chnnged by an intimation, to be regarded for the time being as most secret, which the Secretary for Mines has received from Sir John Cadmnn, to the effect that the Anglo Persian Oil Company have under con-siderntion a scheme for searching for oil in this country.    The scheme when fully developed will involve extensive drilling operations snd will.ensure a renewed search for oil in this country by a company, having substantial resources and a highly skilled staff capable of making full use of the latest geological knowledge.2.   When I brought this question before my colleagues last February they decided (Cabinet 13(33) Conclusion 4) -(a) thnt the exploitation of oil in the United Kingdom must be rendered possible;(b) th-;t the payment of royalties must not be ruled out; md in this connexion it must be remembered thnt Mr. Shinwell&apos;s decision of July 1931, did not debar payment of royalties but insisted thnt they should be paid only with the npprovel of the Secretary for Mines;(c) thnt if oil were found the Government would have to consider how the royalties were to be settled between the owners and the exploiters;(d) thnt the President of the Board of Trade should have authority to base any public statement he might have to mske on the subject on the above policy.In the memorandum which I then circulated on the subject(CP. 36(33)) it was indicated that if oil were discovered insubstantial quantities, or if the larger oil componiesindicated a desire to explore seriously the possibility of finding oil in this country,  the whole question   of thelegislation governing the question might have to be reconsidered.-I-
3,   I feel that the application &quot;by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company mekes it necessary for us to reconsider the question urgently.     Sir John Codman is anxious that his Company should he granted exclusive licences covering some 253 square miles in three different parts of the country.     Indeed, he hss made it clear that unless exclusive rights over large areas are granted to him, the scheme will have to be dropped. (The Secretary for Mines has agreed for the time being not to entertain applications from other persons in respect of these areas).     The Company is already engaged in making local investigations and considering the methods by which they may secure tho necessary rights to enter on land to-enable them to carry out their   scheme.4.   A further difficulty is introduced by the fact that a roprosentative of a substantial Californian oil producing company has informed the Petroleum Department that his Company may wiah to search for oil in this country in the near future. Another approach has also been made on behalf, it was said, of a syndicate which wishes to be allowed to drill for oil and iB already in correspondence with tho principal landowners in one of the aroas in which the Anglo-Persian Oil Company has asked for prior consideration.5.    Under existing legislation - and in view of the feeling, which I think is shared by all my colleagues, that the exploitation of tho natural resources of this country must not bo prevented - I should have no alternative but to authorise tho grant under the Petroleum (Production) Act, 1918, of licences to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company to drill in the areas in question.      Immediately upon their grant, such licences would have to be laid before Parliament, and as soon as it became known that a concern of the size and importance of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company believed that oil could be found in England, any areas selected for prospecting would at once acquire a value which they do not at present possess.
6.   Moreover, should oil he found, a very difficult situation in regard to the payment of royalties would occur. Since oil is a liquid it is impossible to say from what particular piece of ground it is won, and in view of the fact that most estates in this country arc of a comparatively small size, endless disputes might arise.     If the Company drilling for oil attempted to forestall this situation by making royalty agreements with every landowner who might be affected, they might easily find themselves held up owing to the terms demanded by one particular landowner.     In this connexion, I would venture to remind my colleagues of their decision that &quot;if oil were found, the Government would have to consider how the royalties were to be settled between the owners and the exploiters&quot;.7.    In those circumstances I should like to recommend that we should deal with the problem on lines somewhat similar to those on which tho Coalition Government decided to deal with it in 1919.     Subsequent events seemed to point to the improbabilit of the discovery of oil, however, and that Government did not proceed with the introduction of the Bill upon which they had decided.     The decision was to the effect that -(a) tho ownership of all petroleum from borings in the United Kingdom should be vested in the State and that no compensation should be paid to owners of land in respoct of oil itselfj(b) compensation should be paid only in respect of disturbances to property and loss of amenity.8.   As at present thore is foi* practical purposes no mining of oil in this country, this proposal does not involve the confiscation of any value;     three small aroas in respect of which licences to drill have been granted under the Act of 1918 and are still operative would require special consideration.
9. If, however, the State takes over all rights in oil, landowners will no longer have any interest in granting facilities to those who desire to search for oil.    It will, therefore, he necessary to provide some means to enable such persons to secure the necessary rights in case of difficulty. The powers which are provided by the Kines (V/orking Facilities) Acts might easily be adapted for this purpose.    Under these powers application can be,made to the Railway and Canal Commission for the grant of such aneillisry rights as are necessary to enable operations to be carried on and the Commission has powers to settle the terms of payment.10. To sum up, I suggest that we should prepare and introduce at the earliest possible moment legislation to the following effect(a) that the ownership of all petroleum which may exist inthis country should be vested in the State-  and that no compensation should be paid to owners of land in respect of oil itself;(b) the existing rights of owners of the surface to berecompensed for disturbances to property and loss of amenity should not be interfered with;(o) that the three small areas covered by existing licences granted under the 1918 Act should either be excluded or compensation paid - this would not be a difficult matter(d; that persons who Becure a licence or lease from theGovernment to search ana bore for oil shall make their own arrangements with owners of land for the necessary facilities;(e) that where such facilities cannot be obtained byagreement provisions should De made on lines similar to those contained in the Mines (Working Facilities) Acts for securing the grant of the necessary facilities on terms to be determined by the Courts;(f) that an early announcement of the Governments policy should be made with an intimation that pending the passage of the necessary legislation no further licences will be granted under the Petroleum (Production) Act, 1918.
11. I readily admit that this is not an easy policy.    It isa policy which might easily be misrepresented in the House,but there is a good defence, and of the desirability in thenational interest of passing such legislation I am in no doubt.I might quote a passage from the Report of the Royal Commissionon the Coal Industry, in regard to unproven coal:-&quot;There is one aspect of the question which is simple, and with regard to which the course is clear.    It relates to coal which at present has no market value, and for which therefore no claim for compensation can arise.In this class, for instance, is coal the existence of which in workable quantities is unknown,   n    n    *     x a person who owns land under whioh there is in fact workable coal, although no one knows that it is there, possesses no extra market value, above the value of his land for agriculture or other purposes, on account of the unsuspected presence of the coal.    He loses no existing possession if the State, as an act of policy, legislates to the effect that all su^h coal shall vest in public ownership.    What he loses is the possibility of a sudden unforeseen enrichment, if it should happen that coal were in fact to be found in the future under his land.    We consider that, it is in the public interest that legislation of this nature should be passed.&quot;Virtually, the existence of oil in workable quantitiesin this country is unproven.12. But the strongest argument is that if something is not done on the lines which I have suggested, chaos will follow. We might even have tha same situation as has occurred from time to time in the United States of America.    If in a certain part of this country one prospector strikes oil, immediately, in order to secure their share of the benefits, all the landowners in the neighbourhood will claim the right to sink shafts in competition, in order to prevent all the oil which is under their land from being drained away through the neighbouring bore hole.    The possibilities of confusion and disorderly production in such circumstances are endless, and I think we should be found wanting in foresight were we to fail to take stepB to prevent it.13. In view of the history of this question, I circulate, as an annex to this note, an account of recent actual and projected legislation.rd of Trade W.R.84th November, 1933.
ATOEXPetroleum Production in Great Britain. Legis lat ive Po s iti on.1.   The powers which the Government ?.t present nossess are contained in the Petroleum (Production) Act, 1918, under which searching or &quot;boring for oil in this country is prohibited except with license.2.   The Petroleum (Production) -Act fallowed a Bill en rather more comprehensive lines introduced by the Coalition Government of 1917.    This Bill reserved to the Crown the right te search for and get petroleum and provided that the State could either drill itself or license other persons to drill.    The Bill contained a provision for the payment of a small r oyalty on ell oil oroduced. The royalty was to be paid in respect of oil produced, either on behalf of the State or by private operators into a Royalties Fund, and the balance of the fund, after meeting the exnonses of administration, and any expenses of the Railway and Canal Commission undor the Act ir? dealing with matters referred to them, was to be divided amongst those who could substan.tinte a claim t  a share of it.      The Bill provided that where operations for the getting of petroleum were commenced in any district,, the Board ef Trade should, on the application of any person who appeared to them to be   interested, prepare a scheme defining the area, the persons Interested in the land in which were entitled to receive payments cut of the Fund, and regulating the distribution amongst such persona of the sums available for distribution.    Claimants on the Fund had to satisfy the Railway and Canal Commission as to their right to sh^re in the Fund,3.       The Opposition protested against the Royalty provision which they maintained would set up a new vested interest in a mineral net hitherto produced in this country and the existence of which had
not even been proved.   They successfully challenged tho Government on a Division in which only about 80 Members tosk part.   Although there were suggestions that it was a snap Division the Government finally decided not to proceed with the Bill.4.     The Government had intended to introduce another Bill dealing with the matter but nothing was done until in November, 1918, when with tho end of the War, the termination of emergency legislation had to be contemplated, and ft was considered essential to do something to nrevont indiscriminate drilling such as had taken plsce in other countries.   The Act of 1918 was accordingly passed.    During the oassage of this Bill the Government indicated that further legislation would have to follow.5.     In October 1919 the Cabinet decided that legislation should be introduced to provide that(a) the ownership of ell petroleum from borings in the United Kingdom should be vested in the State and that no compensation should be paid to owners of land in respect of oil itself.(b) Compensation should be paid only in respect of disturbance to property and loss of amenity*6.     In pursuance of these instructions a Bill was prepared, but by the time it was ready for submission to the Cabinet Messrs. Pearson 5: Son had carried out a considerable amount of drilling without producing any substantial result.    In the one case where oil in some quantity had been obtained, namely, at Hards toft in Derbyshire, the Duke of Devonshire, who was the lp.nd. owner, brought an action against the Government, the object of which was to establish his rights to the property in the oil obtained.    At this stage the Government was advised that it appeared unlikely,  as a result of the drilling undertaken by Messrs. Pearson 3c Son,  that oil in commercial quantities
iv A; 6would- be discovered in this country, and, on the 7th March, 1921, the Government decided not to introduce the Bill and to terminate as quickly as possible the contract with Messrs. Pearson &amp; Son. The Duke of Devonshire&apos;s claim to the oil produced on his property was subsequently admitted, and a pledge which the Government had given during the passage of the 1918 Act that they would not allow royalties to be charged was withdrawn.7.    Between the passing of the Act and the decision of the Cabinet in March, 1921, three licences were Issued under the Act, two of them in respect of small areas    of 8 square miles and 1 square mile, and the other covering an area of 600 square miles.    These licences which had a time limit of two years, subject to renewal for a further period of two years have all lapsed.    Since March 1921 four other licences have been granted, all In respect of small areas of from three to five square miles,   Ho time limit was mentioned in these licences, which remain in forco as long as the licensee has right of entry from the land owners.    The first of these licences was granted in 1922 to a Syndicate which was voluntarily wound up in 1924, No deep drilling was done.   One was granted to the Duke of Devonshire in respect of the area at Hardstoft already referred to.    Two further bore holes were put down In this area to a depth of about 3,000 feet each without success.   No drilling has taken place in connexion with the third of these licences. In connexion with the fourth, drilling is still being carried out In Sussex and has&quot; reached a depth of about 1,800 feet. There are accordingly only three licences which are still operative.    Three or four other applications have been under consideration for some time but the apnlicants have not yet complied with the official requirements.8. An account of the conditions as to royalties, which
Mr. Shinwell, Secretary for Mines in the Labour Government, wished t* attach to the gr*ant of licences under the Petroleum (Production) Act,  is given in the note attached to CP. 36(33).
