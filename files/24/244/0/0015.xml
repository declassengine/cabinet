HANKEY, Secretary to the Cabinet., Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1.S November 16th,, 1933.
The King&apos;s Speech on the Prorogation of Parliament.November 17, 1933.My Lords and Members of the House of Commons :I REJOICE to observe the steady improvement in trade and employment among My People.Trade Agreements, which will, I trust, be found mutually advantageous, have been concluded with a number of foreign countries. Negotiations with other countries for the conclusion of similar Agreements will shortly be begun.I have been gratified to learn that the question of Flag Discrimination in Portuguese ports, which has for some years been a subject of discussion, has now been satisfactorily settled by an Agreement between My Government and that of the Portuguese Republic.I had pleasure in welcoming to London in June last the delegates to the session of the World Monetary and Economic Conference. My Prime Minister acted as President of the Conference at the request of the Council of the League of Nations.Considerable progress was made with certain questions but owing to unexpected developments in the international monetary and financial situation the Conference was, to My regret, unable to reach conclusions on certain important matters before its adjournment on the 27th July. It is, however, satisfactory that a joint declaration as to their views on some of the principal subjects raised at the Conference was drawn up by Delegations of the British Commonwealth and published. The Conference has left in being suitable organisations charged with the task of fixing the date of reassembly and of making the preliminary arrangements necessary for the purpose.My Government have throughout taken an active part at the Disarmament Conference, and the British Draft, which was presented on the 16th March, was adopted in June last as the basis of the proposed Convention. I earnestly trust that the difficulties which have since arisen may be surmounted. The withdrawal of Germany a month ago from the deliberations at Geneva has necessarily dislocated the programme, but the work for international disarmament by agreement between nations must be vigorously pursued.Members of the House of Commons :I thank you for the provision you have made for the public service.My Lords and Members of the House of Commons :The continued willingness of My People to bear heavy sacrifices has made it possible for this country, almost alone among the great countries of the world, to maintain a satisfactory balance between its national income and expenditure.Confidence has been restored by the pursuit of a sound financial policy, accompanied by the establishment of a reasonable measure of protection for the industry of the United Kingdom. The steps taken to promote the reorganisation of various sections of agriculture and the sea-fishing industry have not yet had time to show their full results, but I am pleased to note that there are already definite signs of improvement.   .
The numbers of the unemployed, though still unhappily far too large, have fallen substantially and continuously in recent months, despite the usual seasonal trend in the opposite direction.Bills have received My assent providing for the amendment and continuation of the Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Acts, for the reorganisation of London passenger transport, for the licensing and regulation of goods motor vehicles, for the consolidation of the law relating to children and young persons and for the amendment of the law relating to the national status of married women.A number of other Measures of public utility have been passed into law. I pray that the blessing of Almighty God may rest upon your labours.
