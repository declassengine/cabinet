Copy No. ^8CP. 267 (33)CABINET.ANGLO-SOVIET NEGOTIATIONS.Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.I ATTACH a memorandum showing the present position of the negotiations with the Soviet representatives. It will be seen that agreement has been reached upon most points.My Department and the Foreign Office have been in close touch during these discussions, but I have not had an opportunity to discuss with the Secretary of State the precise form of our recommendations.The main points on which the present proposals differ from the old Agreement (which gave the Soviets unqualified most-favoured-nation treatment) are that the Russians are now prepared (a) to acknowledge in the Agreement our right to prohibit their goods if theyare offered at prices that &quot;frustrate&quot; Imperial preferences or-that detrimentally affect our home interests. This is an important extension of the scope of Article 21 of our Agreement with Canada;(b) to accept our view that we cannot continue to buy largely from themwhile they buy so little from us. They are willing to include in the Agreement provisions whereby they undertake so to adjust the business, that there will be (after an initial period for the change-over) an approximate balance of payments under which the money they get here for their goods will be spent here.The outstanding points are explained in the memorandum; they are :  (1) The period of negotiation and notice in the event of a complaint by one party that the other is &quot; creating or maintaining prices &quot;; (2) The question of diplomatic immunity for the Soviet Trade representative and his deputies and premises; (3) The question whether the Soviet Government should be required topurchase specified amounts of particular goods (e.g., herrings) or services (e.g.. shipping); and (4) The Lena Goldfields case.Decisions as to our attitude upon these points are needed before the negotiations (which have already been very exhaustive) can be carried further, and we suggest that the line to be taken should be : (1) Period of negotiation and notice. We may offer a period of three months, to cover both negotiations and notice. This is the very least that the Soviet Government are likely to accept, and could, we think,, be defended by us.(2) Immunity. We may agree to continue the immunity in the same limited form that was provided in the old Agreement.We should continue to press for assurances on the three points affecting the Embassy at Moscow. We might in the end give up the points as to the inspection of luggage and railway tickets, but WS-should insist on an assurance as regards food-stuffs.
(3)--i(a) Shipping^-The incentive to charter British&apos; shipping provided by the balance of payments agreement, although considerable, is not in our view sufficiently direct, even if accompanied by assurances of an undefined character. We should press for the inclusion in the Agree-ment of a definite undertaking that not less than 50 per cent, of the tonnage chartered by the Soviet Government should be British.(b) Herrings. We should press for a substantial purchase by the Soviet Government. This would not form part of the main Agree-ment, but might take the form of a separate purchase agreement.(4) Lena Goldfields. We should insist on a written assurance stating (i) that the conclusion of a new Trade Agreement would create afavourable atmosphere in which negotiations between the Company and the Chief Concessions Committee could be reopened with a prospect of a mutually satisfactory settlement; and &apos;(ii) that on the conclusion of a Trade Agreement a meeting betweenthe Chief Concessions Committee and the Lena Goldfields representatives will be held.If we are to reap the maximum benefit from the Agreement as regards next year, it is important that the negotiations should be concluded at an early date, as it is the practice of the Soviet Authorities in Moscow to settle at about this time their programme of purchases for the coming year, and their Trade Delegate here has assured us of the need that he should proceed to headquarters as soon as possible to take part in the discussions there.W. R.Board of Trade,November 10, 1933.
ANGLO-SOVIET NEGOTIATIONS.(Secret.)THE Anglo-Soviet negotiations have now reached a stage when it is possible to present a fairly complete picture of the Agreement that might be concluded and of the outstanding points of difference between the two sides.2. Most-favoured-nation Treatment. By Article 1 of the 1930 Agreement each Party gave to the other most-favoured-nation rights (a) in respect of subjects or citizens and (b) in respect of goods. These rights were of the highest value to the Soviet Government, partly for reasons of prestige but chiefly because they afforded security for Soviet trade, enabling the Soviet organisations to sell goods forward and so ensure the disposal of Russian produce and a steady income in foreign exchange. To us the value of these rights was somewhat problematical, owing to the fact that a monopolistic State can simply refrain from purchasing our goods without at the same time infringing the Agreement.3. The old Article 1 cannot in any case be retained without qualification, because it would prevent us from taking action under Article 21 of the United Kingdom-Canadian Agreement, or from giving home and other Empire producers protection of the same kind as that provided for in Article 21, without at the same time applying similar measures to all foreign goods. It has been a matter of great difficulty to obtain Soviet acceptance of any qualification, as it is a cardinal point of their commercial policy that there should be no discrimination against Soviet goods in foreign countries. The Soviet delegates have, however, now accepted the principle involved in Article 21 and have agreed that it should be embodied in an Article, qualifying the most-favoured-nation provisions of Article 1 in respect of goods. A copy of the proposed Article is annexed; under this our right to prohibit Soviet goods is not confined to cases affecting Canadian preferences, but covers (a) all Imperial preferences and (&amp;) home interests that may be detrimentally affected by Soviet imports at State-maintained low prices. There is, however, one most important difference outstanding, namely, as to a minimum period for the negotiations and the notice provided for in the Article. This matter is dealt with more fully in a later paragraph.4. Balance of Payments. In order to remove the one-sided character of an Agreement of a purely most-favoured-nation character, the Soviet delegates were asked to undertake to correct the adverse trade balance. &quot;While regarding pur proposals as based on unsound economic principles, they agreed to meet us by establishing, by stages, an approximate balance of payments between the two countries. They would undertake, as part of the Agreement, that Soviet pay-ments in the United Kingdom should bear to Soviet proceeds in the United Kingdom the following proportions : Thereafter there would be an approximate balance of payments in which Soviet payments would not be less than an amount bearing to Soviet proceeds the proportion 1:1-1. Soviet payments would include payments in respect of services (e.g., particularly shipping freights) as well as payments for goods.5. It has in general not been contemplated to require the Soviet Government to purchase specified quantities of particular classes of goods, and it is known that any such proposal would be most unacceptable to the Soviet Government. In this connection the question has been raised whether it is possible to obtain any special concession for the herring industry. This question is dealt with below among the other outstanding points.6. Diplomatic Immunity and Jurisdiction of United Kingdom Coiirts.  Article 2 of the old Agreement accorded diplomatic immunity to the Soviet Trade Representative and his two deputies and to the premises of the Trade Delegation. It also provided that questions arising out of commercial transactions entered into by the Soviet Trade Delegation should be decided in the courts of the UnitedI. The present proposals compared with the 1930 Agreement.In the year 1934, 1In the year 1935, 1In the year 1936, 1In the year 1937, 11-7. 1-5. 1-4. 1-2.
Kingdom. The question whether diplomatic immunity should be granted has been left open, and is one of the outstanding points. It is dealt with further below. The provisions relating to the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom Courts are required, whether diplomatic immunity is granted to the Trade Delegation or not,.on account of the sovereign immunity which is in any case enjoyed by a foreign Government. These provisions required strengthening; they have been redrafted and (after prolonged discussion) have been accepted in their revised form by the Soviet representatives.7. Shipping.-By Article 3 of the old Agreement the Parties accorded to each other, subject to certain qualifications, most-favoured-nation and national rights in respect of ships and their cargoes and passengers. This Article deals, however, only with navigational questions; there was nothing in the old Agreement to provide for the position which arises from the essential differences in the trading methods of the Soviet and other countries. In the case of the latter, British ships are free to negotiate with individual foreign shippers for the carriage of available passengers and cargo, whilst in the case of Russia, British ships can only obtain business through the Soviet chartering organisation, which is able either not to employ British shipping or to use its monopolistic powers to depress rates to a level unremunerative to British shipping, and thus indirectly to discriminate against it. In the case of British liners calling at Soviet ports, the Soviet can prevent their getting any passengers or cargoes at all.8. In order to safeguard British shipping and shipbrokers against the forms of&apos; discrimination to which they were subject under the old Agreement, the Soviet Government have been asked to undertake (1) that in cases where Soviet ports were previously served by British liners, British shipowners should be allowed to share the trade with Soviet ships; (2) that 50 per cent, of the tonnage chartered by the Soviet Government should be British, and (3) that 70 per cent, of the tonnage chartered by the Soviet Government should be chartered through British shipbrokers. These proposals merely seek to secure for British ships a share of Russian business equal to their share of general world shipping business, and for British shipbrokers the share of Russian business they enjoyed before the Soviet regime. The proposals are, however, unacceptable to the Soviet Government. Apart from the advantage to shipping resulting from the Balance of Payments scheme (paragraph 4 above), the most they will offer is a letter expressing their intention of chartering an increased proportion of British shipping at reasonable rates. This question therefore forms an outstanding point which is dealt with more fully below.9. Dominions, India and the Colonies. Articles 4-6 of the old Agreement dealt with the position of the Dominions, India, and the Colonies. The Dominions do not now wish to be included in any way. As the new Agreement would include provisions, particularly as to the balance of payments, which are not readily applicable to other parts of the Empire, the provisions relating to India and the Colonies have required reconsideration. On the whole it has seemed best merely to provide that so long as India or a Colony accords most-favoured-nation treatment to Soviet goods, the Soviet Government will accord the same treatment to the goods of that country. The Soviet Delegates have agreed to settle the matter on these lines.10. Termination of Agreement. Article 7 of the old Agreement provided that it should continue in force until six months after notice of denunciation was given by either Party to terminate it. A similar provision would be appropriate in a new Agreement. This would not, of course, delay any action that it might be desired to take in respect of a particular class of goods in the circumstances contemplated in the Article referred to in paragraph 3. The Soviet Delegates have proposed that it should be provided that notice to terminate the-Agreement should not be given for at least two years after it comes into force. We have explained to them that, in our view, such a provision would be open to objection from every point of view. On the one hand, it would suggest that no attempt was to be made for at least two years to settle the outstanding question of debts, and, on the other hand, it would invite a reconsideration of the question of trade just at the time when the benefit of the balance of payments, arrangements is beginning to be felt.   As this Soviet proposal was put forward at a very late
stage, it is still to be hoped that the Soviet Government will change their view; when they have had an opportunity of considering fully the point of view which we have put before them.11. Protocol to 1930 Agreement. As in the case of the old Agreement, it is proposed that trade between the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union shall be eligible for export credits on the same basis as trade between the United Kingdom and other foreign countries. While it is contemplated that Anglo-Soviet trade should in the future be carried on to an increasing extent on a cash basis, the transition will have to be gradual if exports to the. Soviet Union are to attain a satisfactory levelin the next few years.12. It will be remembered that it was decided not to make the conclusion of a new Temporary Commercial Agreement conditional upon a settlement of the question of old debts and claims. At the outset of the negotiations an Aide-Memoire was handed to the Soviet Delegates, in which it was stated that His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom desired to record that thej&apos; maintained and asserted both their own claims and those of their nationals : that the negotiation of a permanent Treaty of Commerce and Navigation must be accompanied by a satisfactory settlement of these debts and claims; and that they must regard any commercial agreement that may be negotiated meanwhile as being of a temporary and transitional character, pending a final disposal of this question.13. While the debts and claims question is not, therefore, an outstanding difficulty in the way of a Temporary Commercial Agreement, there is one claim which, arising.as it does from an Agreement made by the Soviet Government, falls in a different class from that of claims against the previous Russian Government or those arising out of the revolution. This is the claim of the Lena Goldfields Company. Without expressly making it a condition of the conclusion of the new Agreement, we have urged the Soviet representatives to give assurances that progress will be made towards a satisfactory settlement of this claim, but they have shown no disposition to improve on their previous unsatisfactory offer, and this matter forms one of the outstanding difficulties.II. Outstanding Points.lL   The principal outstanding points are thus : (i) the period of negotiation and notice in the event of a complaint by one party that the other is &quot; creating or maintaining prices.&quot; (ii) the question of diplomatic immunity for the Soviet Trade Representa-tive and his deputies and premises.(iii) the question whether the Soviet Government should be required topurchase specified amounts of particular goods (e.g., herrings) or services (e.g., shipping).(iv) the Lena Goldfields case.(i) Period of Negotiation and Notice.15. The Soviet Delegates, while accepting the reservation to most-favoured-nation treatment indicated in the draft Article annexed, regard a minimum period of negotiation and notice as essential. They at first held out for, three months&apos; negotiation, followed by three months&apos; notice. Later, they stated that they would agree to two months&apos; negotiation and three months&apos; notice, making a period of five months in all between the date of representations and the expiry of notice. We pointed out that, having denounced the old Agreement because it would have taken six months to free our hands, we cannot, now tie them for five. We further deprecated fixing any period for negotiations, since a period which would suffice in an arguable case or one involving complicated negotiations might be quite excessive in other cases. Finally, the Soviet Delegates stated that as a &quot; minimum of minima &quot; they would accept an unspecified period for negotiation, followed by at least three months&apos; notice. As regards the period of notice, we intimated that, while one month was the longest period we could offer for notice alone, we would be prepared to offer two months to cover both negotia-tions/and- notice. The Soviet Delegates would not accept this. We have maintained our point of view that it would be impossible to justify inaction for&apos;[9269] b 3n^ntMMMWg^^ ........
so long a period as three months after His Majesty&apos;s Government, following a full exploration of the matter on the lines contemplated, had reached the conclusion that further negotiation was useless and that action was called for.16. The question is one of real difficulty. The Soviet Delegates point out that with no fixed period for negotiation there is nothing to prevent us from making our notice practically simultaneous with the original representations. In these circumstances our proposal would render their trade liable to be stopped at a month&apos;s notice. In such a state of insecurity they fear that buyers would hesitate to enter into forward contracts, and that the volume of Russian sales, and consequently of Russian orders, would be disappointingly small. They point out that such a state of affairs would be inconsistent with the professed intention of His Majesty&apos;s Government to develop trade between the two countries. They have pressed hard for a provision exempting from any prohibition goods contracted for at the time when representations were first made, but it has been found impossible to draft such provisions in a way that would not have encouraged the conclusion of contracts in a form calculated to nullify the whole intention of the Article.17. It cannot be denied that there is substance in the Soviet contention that a satisfactory volume of Anglo-Russian trade, in both directions, is largely dependent upon some security that if Soviet goods are bought they will be able to be imported and that large commitments in the form of orders for this country (particularly for capital goods such as heavy electrical plant), are made difficult without some assurance that proceeds from the sale of goods will be available to meet them. On the other hand, a considerable measure of insecurity is inherent in Article 21 of the United Kingdom-Canadian Agreement and all that it implies. Security for Anglo-Soviet trade, and a free hand to protect home and Empire producers by prohibiting imports from Russia, are formally incompatible. The matter would, perhaps, be most usefully considered in terms of the question, what is the maximum period of security that could be allowed between the time of first making representations to the Soviet Government and the expiration of notice. It is possible that if we were to offer three months&apos; security, i.e., three months in all for both negotiations and notice, the offer would be accepted; no shorter period seems likely to counterbalance, in the Soviet view, the great danger which they run in having accepted a derogation from their cardinal principle that there should be no discrimination against them. Nothing, of course, has yet been said that might suggest to. the Soviet Delegates that we would go as far as this.(ii) Diplomatic Immunity for Trade Representatives.18. There is no doubt that the Soviet Government attach the highest importance, largely for reasons of prestige, to the grant of diplomatic immunity to their Trade Representative, his two Deputies, and the premises of the Trade Delegation. All their Commercial Agreements with other foreign countries contain such provisions, the immunity extending in some cases to the whole staff of the Delegation. It is quite possible that they would finally refuse to conclude an Agreement with us at all unless the immunity granted under the 1930 Agreement were retained. At the last meeting they repeated that they did not &quot; visualise &quot; an Agreement without it.19. While there is, of course, considerable objection in principle to granting to officials engaged solely in trade privileges appropriate only to diplomats, the practical importance of the matter to us is limited. It does not affect the position of Soviet trading organisations in. this country (Arcos, R.O.P., &amp;c). These bodies would get no protection from the immunity which we are asked to renew. It affects only three individuals and one set of rooms in Bush House. It is true that, if the immunity were granted, these individuals and premises could be used for subversive activities without fear of interference; but such activities could be conducted with equal safety from the Soviet Embassy.20. There are certain questions outstanding as to the treatment of British diplomatic and consular representatives in Russia, namely, the insistence of the Soviet authorities on inspecting their luggage when they leave the country, their refusal to allow British officials to pay for railway tickets in roubles, and
the risk that excessive prices may be charged for food and other necessaries. Of these the last is the most important, and, in the discussions about the continuance of the exceptional privileges enjoyed by the head of the Trade Delegation and his two deputies, the Soviet Delegates have been informed that His Majesty&apos;s Government must press for assurances that in future there will be proper treatment of these British officials.(iii) Specific Undertakings as to Shipping and Herrings.21. The grounds upon which the Soviet Government see objection to giving any undertaking to charter a specified proportion of British ships or to purchase a specified quantity of herrings are largely similar and the two points may, therefore, be considered together.22. They contend that the balance of payments agreement has considerably curtailed their freedom to do business and that they cannot accept anything that would introduce further rigidity into their foreign trade. They have agreed to spend in this country the greater part and ultimately the whole of the proceeds of the sale of Soviet goods in the United Kingdom, but having done this, they argue that they should at least be free to choose on what they will spend their money.23. When the proposals relating to shipping were under discussion, the Soviet Delegates stated that, if they once conceded the principle that they should. purchase stated quantities of particular goods or services, they (and, incidentally, we, too) would be open to demands from every industry that is interested in the Russian market. If they agreed to charter a given proportion of ships, why should they not also buy a given proportion or quantity of machine tools ? Further, they would be at the mercy of any industry that succeeded in forming a price ring against them. They urged that the balance of payments arrangement in itself provided them with an incentive to purchase British goods and services; to a greater extent than in the past.24. These contentions are not without substance. Indeed, since the total sum to be spent here by the Soviet Government is to be fixed by reference to their proceeds in this country, it can be argued that, if, by pressing the Soviet Govern-ment to purchase a given quantity of some particular goods or services, we cause them to buy more of that particular commodity or service than they would otherwise have bought, the only effect will be to reduce the amount of money available for other goods and services; in short, that we should be robbing Peter to pay Paul.25. On the other hand, there are special reasons connected with the shipping and herring industries for making every attempt to secure special advantages for them. Both industries are exceptionally depressed, and, since, both are primarily interested in overseas trade, neither has derived any direct benefit from the Government&apos;s change of fiscal policy. Both industries have been adversely affected by the change of regime in Russia.26. As regards shipping, certain liner services to Russian ports have been put out of business by the fact that the Soviet Government do not make it possible for them to obtain either passengers or cargo. Soviet statistics indicate that, of the ships chartered by them, only 19 per cent, are British. Allowing for Soviet-&apos; owned tonnage, therefore, the share of British shipping in Soviet overseas trade is substantially less than 19 per cent. The percentage of British tonnage in world overseas trade is 43 per cent., and in seaborne trade between Empire and foreign countries, 60 per cent. It is considered that the low percentage referred to above affords definite evidence of the kind of discrimination referred to in paragraph 7 above. When the 1930 Agreement was being negotiated, we pressed for certain provisions which would have afforded a measure of security for British shipping. We were then told that our fears were-groundless, but they have since proved only too well-founded.27. As regards herrings, it is estimated that the quantity of herrings exported from this country before the war and consumed in the territories which now form the Soviet Union amounted annually to about 800,000 barrels a year, or about one-third of the exported output of the. industry. Since the war the -average exports to the Soviet Union have been no more than 68,000 barrels a year.
. ;8j ..This year the Soviet Government have, bought no herrings here.* In these circumstances the purchasing policy of the Soviet Government may be regarded as among the major causes of the depressed condition of the herring industry. We have indicated to the Soviet Delegates that, while we shall not press for a specific reference to herrings in the Agreement, an undertaking to purchase an increased quantity of herrings should be given in a separate document; but the Soviet representatives have not so far agreed to this. It has been pointed out also that a failure, to purchase herrings in this country in a year in which herrings are being bought from Norway might prove to be an important factor when the question of concluding an Agreement was being considered.(iv) Lena Goldfields.28. It will be recalled that the compensation awarded by the Arbitration Court to the Company was  12,965,000. The Soviet Government refused to regard the Arbitration Court as competent, and suggested that the Company should negotiate with the Chief Concessions Committee in Moscow. The only offer made by the latter was the &quot; derisory &quot; one of  800,000, and the negotiations broke down in September 1931. The matter was again pressed by His Majesty&apos;s Government, and His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Moscow was authorised to discuss unofficially with M. Kameneff, the President of the Chief Concessions Committee, the prospects of a settlement at  3,500,000, representing the proved capital losses of the Company after taking into account all counter-claims put forward by the Committee. M. Kameneff, however, refused even to submit to the Soviet Government any figure over  1,000,000.29. On the 26th January, in connection with the present negotiations, an Aide-Memoire was handed to the Soviet Delegates, in which it was pointed out that, while the Lena Goldfields claim was not within the scope of the present negotiations, an early and satisfactory settlement would much improve the atmosphere and would prevent the negotiations from being jeopardised by public agitation on the matter. No offer was, however, forthcoming, and the Foreign Secretary was obliged to make a statement on the matter on the 13th March (Official Report Columns 1599-1601). On the resumption of the negotiations in July a further interview took place between Colonel Colville and the Soviet Ambassador, and the latter was urged to give some indication that the case was progressing so that we could justify to public opinion our decision to proceed with the negotiations. M. Maisky, however, was unable to add anything to what he had previously stated. The prospects of a settlement would be better, he said, in the favourable atmosphere created by a new Trade Agreement. There the matter has rested until the meeting held on the 6th November, when the Soviet Delegates, on being reminded of it, maintained the view they have adopted from the beginning, namely, that this matter is quite outside the scope of the present negotiations.Board of Trade, November 10, 1933.- * Their only important purchase this year has been 150,000 barrels from Norway, in respect of which -it is understood that some Norwegian Government, credit was available. In. 15)32 they bought 128,800 barrels here and 486,000 barrels from Norway.
ANNEX.Reservation to Most-Favoured-Nation Treatment.Draft A rticle proposed by the British Delegation.IF during the existence of this Agreement either Contracting Party has reason to-believe that, in respect of any class of goods exported for consumption in the United Kingdom or the US.SR., as the case may be, such prices are being created or maintained by the other Party, or by its State economic organisations, as are likely to frustrate preferences accorded by it, or detrimentally to affect the production of such goods in the United Kingdom or the U.S.S.R., as the case may be, the former Contracting Party may make representations to the other Party with a view to negotiations, and, failing a settlement by negotiation, the former Contracting Party, if satisfied,, that the circumstances above referred to. continue to exist, may give notice to the other Party that after the expiration of [one]* calendar month from the date of notice, the provisions of Article 1 of this Agreement will cease to apply to goods of the class in respect of which it is so satisfied, and after the expiration of [one]* calendar month from the date of notice those provisions shall cease to apply to such goods until the Contracting Party which has given such notice is satisfied that action has been taken by the other Party to prevent the recurrence of the circumstances referred to.The Contracting Party which has given such notice will consider any representations that may from time to time be made by the other Contracting Party, and if the former Contracting Party is satisfied that action has been taken by the other Party to prevent the recurrence in respect of any class of goods of the circumstances as a result of which notice was given, it will inform the Other Contracting Party that it is so satisfied, and the provisions of Article 1 of this Agreement will thereupon again apply to such goods.o* An alternative proposal was made to the Soviet Delegates under which the Contracting- Party giving the notice would intimate a date from which it would operate, such date to be not earlier than two months from the date upon which the original representations were made. Thus the period of two months would cover both the negotiations and notice.   See paragraph 15 of the memorandum.
