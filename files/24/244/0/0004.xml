NINTH REPORT.Sunrey of the economic situation, 1933. Introductory.1. WE devoted our eighth report, dated July 1933 (Council paper E.A.C. (S.C.) 8), mainly to a survey of the economic position and prospects in the United States, and to a discussion of the reactions which American developments were likely to have upon the situation in Great Britain and other countries. We expressed ourselves unable to give &quot;a confident or clear-cut answer&quot; to the question whether the American recovery, which at that time was proceeding rapidly, was likely to prove ephemeral or enduring. We indicated that &quot;the first really critical test&quot; would occur &quot;when the Industrial Recovery Act codes have been finally determined, and the incentive to produce in anticipation of higher labour costs may accordingly be removed,&apos;&apos; and that &apos;&apos; an industrial setback is then possible.&quot; But we were &quot;on the whole optimistic that the forces of recovery will retain the upper hand for some time to come,&quot; while expressing the view that the &apos;&apos; possibility of sustaining the recovery next year &apos;&apos; would depend on a revival in the &quot;demand for the products of the engineering and constructional trades which at the moment shows little signs of improvement.&quot;2. As regards Great Britain, we argued that &quot;before the complications introduced by the new turn of American policy, the conditions were established in Great Britain for a gradual but steady expansion of domestic economic activity, without any very good prospect of a corresponding improvement in overseas trade.&quot; We were of opinion that the future course of our recovery would be vitally affected by American developments, stating that &quot;while it is conceivable that a steady recovery might continue, here, despite a setback in the United States, the outlook for Great Britain will be greatly improved, if the American situation develops favourably.&quot;3. The evidence which has accumulated since this report was written now makes it possible to discover more clearly the trend of economic activity during the present year in different parts of the world; and we think it desirable to revert to our normal practice of prefacing our appreciation of the present situation by a survey of the chief statistical information that is available.
Part I. Survey of recent economic developments.4. It is clear that throughout the world there has been a marked revival of economic activity during the present year. The following table shows the trend of the indices of production in the principal industrial countries : ilJUJ .....Table I. .   ^ .   ...Indices of production in the principal industrial countries.Year.Great Britain.

It would be unsafe, however, to draw from these figures any quantitative -comparisons as to the extent of the recovery in different countries; for the sensitiveness of the indices necessarily varies in accordance with their weighting and composition, and the comparatively small decline in the British index during 1931 and 1932 suggests that it must be less sensitive in character than that of France in particular. Possibly a safer guide to quantitative comparisons may be found in the figures relating to employment.Table 2. Employment.Year.	Great Britain.

These figures indicate an increase in employment between March and August of about 5 per cent, in Great Britain, of about 2 per cent, in France, of nearly 30 per cent, in the United States, and between March and July of nearly 12 per cent, in Germany.
7. The figures of steel production show a very large increase alike in Great Britain, on the continent and in the United States.  . ...     ,   ,Table 3.   &apos; &apos; : -/Steel production.(In thousand tons of 2,240 lbs.)Year.

An important part, however, of the increase in British steel production represents the displacement of imports, which fell during the three months in question from a monthly average of 130,000 tons in 1932 to one of 72,000 tons in 1933. Allowing for the changes in imports and exports, the increased consumption of iron and steel in Great Britain was about 16^ per cent, for the three months mentioned, though the big jump in the production figures for September show that the recovery has proceeded much further since. In Germany, on the other hand, exports have diminished markedly, and imports have increased, so that the German consumption of steel has increased considerably more than the production figures indicate.8. While the figures of steel production suggest a substantial revival of economic activity in France in the early part of the year, the figures of railway traffics convey a different impression: Table 4.

As regards the trend in recent weeks, the general impression conveyed by the information available is that the recovery in Great Britain is proceeding steadily, and perhaps with increasing momentum, that there is no evidence as yet of any setback in Germany, that in France, on the other hand, there is a tendency for the improvement to slacken off and that in the United States, where the recovery proceeded with exceptional rapidity during the summer, there has recently been a considerable recession. The New. York Times index of business activity has shown the following movement since July, in which month the American recovery reached its highest point.	Table	6.

The figures^relating to the production of electric power in France and Great Britain and the United States suggest&quot;, on the whole, a very similar rate of progress in the three countries. ,...............- - &apos; &apos;&apos;   -Table 5.

There are recent signs that the progressive deterioration in the volume of world trade may have at last been checked, despite the difficulties imposed by the intensified trade restrictions in force throughout the world. It is true that there are no very clear signs of improvement in the latest available figures of the League of Nations index of world trade.Table 8.League of Nations index of the gold value of world trade.

The British foreign trade figures are decidedly encouraging.11. The movement of commodity prices in the different countries is shown in the following table.:-

We have made an analysis of the unemployment figures which suggests that the improvement in employment which has occurred in Great Britain during the past year is very largely attributable to a recrudescence of constructional activity. .,;Table 9.

14. The above table suggests that the revival of constructional activity is by no means confined to house-building, but is general in character. The figures of building plans approved continue to be satisfactory:-Table 11.Building plans approved in Great Britain in 146 towns.Year.		1st quarter.	2nd quarter.	3rd quarter.	4th quarter.1929		15-7	22-1	16-4	18-91930		18-8	20-2	17-2	18-41931	i-&apos;.&apos; ..    &apos;     v.	16-3	16-9	16-3	18-61932		14-5	18-1	14-3	19-41933		19-6	21-9 .	20-7f	* These towns do not include London. f This figure relates to 143 authorities only.15. A marked feature of the development in Great Britain during recent months has been the steady narrowing in the margin between the rates of interest obtainable on Government securities and industrial preference shares and debentures. This is well shown by the movement of the Actuaries Investment Index.Table 12.

The rise in the prices of industrial ordinary shares is also very significant as an indication of returning confidence. On the basis of the dividends being paid, the yield on industrial ordinary shares at the end of September was only 3-61 per cent., while the average earnings on the shares included in the index represented, a net loss of 1-19 per cent.[9187] d

Apart from Great Britain herself, a marked improvement has taken place during the present year in other parts of the British Empire. The strengthening of the economic position of India, Australia (which has been able to show a substantial Budget surplus and to remit taxation), and other countries in the Empire and in the sterling area generally is indeed one of the outstanding features of the present economic situation.18. One of the most singular phenomena of recent months has been the development of a large-scale hoarding of gold on private account, chiefly, it is believed, by individuals or institutions in the United States and in the gold countries on the continent, as a protection against the possibilities of exchange depreciation. In the course of the present year the net imports of gold into this country amount to approximately  128,700,000 valued at the current market price. Of this importation,  59,700,000 took place up to the end of May, during which time the Bank of England was adding to its gold holdings. The increase in the latter amounted to approximately  66,000,000 at par during the first five months of the year, which at the current market price would have been valued at approximately  95,000,000. Up to May, therefore, it may be assumed that not less than  35,000,000 of gold at current market price, or  25,000,000 at par, which was being held by the Exchange Equalisation Fund at the beginning of the year was transferred to the Bank during the months in question. Since May the net importation of gold has been at a very much greater rate than the increase in the Bank&apos;s gold holdings.Table 14.Net imports of gold.JuneJuly ... August...

At that time there was a serious attack upon certain gold currencies, notably the Dutch florin, and a substantial premium was paid for the possession of gold rather than gold currencies. When the gold currencies became strong the premium On gold diminished.   Gold, however, is still being absorbed by continental buyers.[9187]d in recent weeks imports and exports of gold have been as follows : Table 15.Imports and exports ofgold into the United Kingdom.
Part II. The economic outlook.&apos;.f 19. While, as the above survey shows, the industrial recovery that has taken place during the present year has been general throughout the world, perhaps the most striking feature of the present phase of world economic affairs is the diversity which has lately grown up in the economic conditions and the outlook -of different countries,20. In both the United States and Germany the attempt has been made during the last few months to force a rapid economic recovery by intensive Government action of an extremely heterodox character. The natural preoccupa-tion in the outside world with the political side of the Nazi regime has obscured recognition of the considerable degree of similarity between the economic policies of the German and American Governments. In both countries, the Government possesses an unusual power, resting partly on exceptional legislative authority and partly on the mobilization behind it of a formidable mass opinion, of inducing the business world to conform to its wishes; and in both countries the Government has endeavoured to force the pace of industrial recovery by exploiting this power to the utmost. In Germany, employers have been made aware that the engagement of additional workpeople is a patriotic duty and the dismissal of workpeople an offence. In the United States, employers have been induced to accept codes designed to increase their workers&apos; purchasing power, In both cases, the effect has been to secure an immediate increase of industrial production in excess of current demand. In both countries the hope is enter-tained that the momentum thus generated will serve to stimulate the demand which is required to sustain the increased production; and in both countries the Government is also endeavouring to further the same end by pressing forward -schemes of public work, which probably in the case of Germany, and, indeed, in that of the United States as well, includes a measure of rearmament.21. In respect of other very important matters, of course, the policies of the two countries diverge. There is no parallel in Germany to the ostentatious monetary heterodoxy which is a central feature of the American experiment, to the essentially deliberate depreciation of the dollar and the preoccupation with raising prices. Germany is precluded from following the American example in this respect, both by the vivid recollections which her people have of the experiences of post-war inflation and by the inherent weakness of her inter-national financial position. . So far, accordingly, from encouraging a depreciation of the mark, it remains her policy to maintain a nominal gold parity by the exercise of the most stringent exchange controls. Similarly, on the industrial side, no encouragement is given to the raising of wages, but rather the reverse; the employment of additional workpeople is the essential means, as well as the end, of the German experiment. These differences have an important bearing on the present situation in the two countries. For whereas in the United States, production, having been exceptionally stimulated in recent months by the expectation of higher costs of production under the Recovery codes, is undergoing a, consequential setback now that the codes have begun to operate, the German recovery, not having been stimulated in this particular manner, is not exposed to this particular reaction. The American position, moreover, includes many elements, notably, for example, the present exchange level of the dollar, which represent the speculative anticipation of events which would have further far-reaching repercussions if they were actually to occur. It is thus exposed to various possibilities of disturbance from which the German position is at present free,22. It may well prove, however, that these differences are less fundamental than they may appear. For the German economic policy, entailing as it does an increase of unremunerative Government expenditure, and an adverse turn in the international balance of payments, must make it more difficult to maintain the stability of the monetary and financial position. Already, indeed, an important step in the direction of exchange depreciation has been taken in the arrangements which enable German exporters to use the proceeds of their sales abroad to purchase marks in &quot; blocked &quot; accounts at a substantial discount. Over the German experiment, equally with-the American, there hangs the doubt
as to whether the demand of consumers will in .fact increase sufficiently to sustain the industrial recovery which has been artificially generated in the meantime. Finally, it is important to note that in both countries the credit of the Administration is staked in an altogether peculiar degree on a striking success in the economic sphere. Neither the American President nor the German Chancellor: can afford to allow the impression to prevail that economic forces have been too much for him. Neither, accordingly, in the event of a serious setback, is likely to revert to cautious orthodoxy. Each must be expected, on the contrary, to plunge into still more heterodox expedients, in the hope of maintaining confidence in his ability to control the situation.23. In the United States, indeed, where the industrial recovery has already undergone a considerable setback, and where the coming event of the reassembly of a Congress bent on radical experiment is already casting its shadows before, the President has recently made what may prove to be an important new departure by announcing that arrangements will be made to control the gold value of the dollar by the Government purchase and sale of gold; and further dramatic strokes of policy are possible at any time. In Germany the desire to forestall the growth of disillusionment with the results of the economic programme may have been a factor in the decision of the Government to withdraw from the Disarmament Conference, while, as regards the future, it seems not unlikely that the exigencies of the industrial situation may count as an important influence on the side of an active rearmament policy.24. The gold standard countries, France, Holland, Switzerland, Italy, Belgium and Poland, are pursuing policies which are in sharp contrast to those of the United States. They have committed themselves afresh to a determination to maintain the existing gold parities of their currencies, and their Central Banks have agreed to co-operate with one another to this end. The maintenance of the gold standard has thus become the governing economic purpose of the gold -countries; and, in conformity with this, a cautious orthodoxy prevails in every branch of economic policy.25. While the gold countries have shared in the general business improve-ment which has occurred in the present year, the most recent indications are less favourable, and some of the economic tendencies which have lately been in evidence are such as to create in the gold bloc as a whole, and especially in France, a profound uneasiness as to the future. The fall that took place after the World Economic Conference in the gold value not only of the dollar, but of ^sterling, was an influence tending to depress commodity prices in gold countries; and a further fall in these prices would have to be expected if the exchanges were to continue to move as they have done in recent months, i.e., a big further fall in the gold value of the dollar, accompanied by a further smaller fall in the gold value of the pound. Thus there yawns before the gold countries the possibility, in the event of certain exchange developments, of an indefinite continuance of the deflationary process; and this possibility is heightened, notably in France and Holland, by the revelation of substantial budget deficits and the consequent necessity, which the policy of rigid monetary orthodoxy makes especially -compelling, of increasing taxation and cutting expenditure. Recently, it is true, there has been a recovery in the gold value of the dollar and the pound, mainly as the result of the distrust of the franc arising from the uncertainties &quot;of the European political situation. But, while this may serve for the time being to abate the deflationary pressure on the gold countries, distrust of the franc has other formidable dangers for Frenchmen, and a temporary equipoise between distrust of the dollar and distrust of the franc affords a very precarious basis for French economic life. The fact that the powerful economic systems, associated with the dollar and the pound sterling, are now both detached from gold makes the economic stability of the countries which still adhere to it peculiarly vulnerable to developments outside their control. In these circumstances, it. is not surprising that the business improvement of the present year should have failed to produce in the gold countries the assured confidence, the conviction that the tide of trade has definitely turned towards recovery, which is, now firmly established in Great Britain and throughout the sterling area. On the.contrary, there are some indications in the gold countries of the extreme apprehensiveness,
tlie sense that there is no firm ground underfoot; which prevailed in this country during 1931.   .26. Thus, alike in the United States and Germany, and in the gold countries, the economic outlook is clouded by a profound uncertainty, which, among other manifestations, has led to the remarkable phenomenon referred to-above, of a large-scale hoarding of gold on private account, carrying with it new possibilities of future monetary disturbance.27. In Great Britain and in most countries of the sterling area, on the other hand; the business recovery is overshadowed by no similar sense of impending reaction or disturbance. Inasmuch as it has not been stimulated by any heterodox expedients, it does not stand to suffer now from their possible failure, though it may, of course, be affected to some extent by the repercussions of the failure of such expedients elsewhere. On the other hand, the depreciation which sterling underwent two years ago relieves the countries attached to it from many of the difficulties with which the gold countries are faced. The competitive position of the sterling countries is in the main satisfactory. The independent management of sterling affords a safeguard against the danger of art enforced renewal of deflation as the result of monetary developments in other countries. Again, the public finances both of Great Britain and of other parts of the British Empire have taken a favourable turn which encourages the expectation that the industrial recovery may shortly receive the stimulus, as is already happening in Australia, of tax remissions.28. When we look further beneath the surface there are various indications that the recovery in the sterling area is based on a more reliable foundation than it is elsewhere. The effective rate of interest in Great Britain is steadily tending to fall. British Government credit is now firmly established on the 3-J per cent, basis, which seemed an almost daring objective a year ago (a rate which compares with a yield of nearly 4^ per cent, on French Rentes and a much higher yield on other securities based on the credit of the French Government); while, as has been pointed out above, there has been a steady and substantial fall in the yields, obtainable on other fixed-interest securities, such an industrial debentures and preference shares. It may be that interest-rates must fall considerably further and that the facilities of low interest-rates must be more widely spread before a satisfactory position, justified by the productivity of capital, is reached. But at least there has been an encouraging measure of progress in the right direction.29. The history of trade depressions suggests that the establishment of lower rates of interest is of fundamental importance as a condition of recovery. In times of normal trade a large proportion of the labour-power and productive resources of an industrial country is employed in the construction of capital goods. When depression comes, the demand for capital goods undergoes a far more serious curtailment than does that for consumable goods. This is only natural in view of the fact that a decline in the demand for consumable goods by as much as 5 per cent, may suffice to create a condition of unremunerative trading and surplus capacity in the industries producing them, and may- thus dry up almost altogether the demand for fresh productive capacity, leaving little for the cqn-structional industries to do other than to meet the replacement demands which are also apt to be reduced substantially. The impasse which usually makes itself felt at the bottom of a severe depression, arises largely from the fact that the widespread unemployment in the constructional industries so lowers aggregate purchasing-power as to prevent an adequate recovery in the demand for con-sumable goods, while the inadequacy of the demand for consumable goods deters the revival of constructional activity. In breaking through this impasse, the movement towards lower interest-rates, which normally develops during a depression, plays a vital part; for the easier terms on which capital can be borrowed serves to offset the diminished profitability of capital enterprise, and, as-soon accordingly as the conviction becomes established that constructional costs have touched their lowest point, the demand for constructional goods begins to revive,, taking first the form of an increased replacement demand, and spreading from that to a demand for new productive capacity in those industries&apos; which are subject to a secular increase in demand or in which important hew technological discoveries have been made. The revival of constructional activity improves aggregate purchasing-power, and, consequently, the demand for consumable&apos; goods;
and the process of recovery tends accordingly to be cumulative. On the other hand, a recovery-from a severe depression is unlikely to proceed very far if it,is confined to an improvement in the output of consumable goods, and fails to stimulate increased constructional activity.; 30. ; As we have pointed out in part I, the revival of constructional activity has been a marked feature of the recovery in Great Britain in the past year. Up to the present, it is true, there have been few instances of new capital enterprises financed by new public issues. None the less, there can be little doubt that the movement towards lower interest rates, and what is the same thing from another angle, the higher prices of fixed-interest investments, have a material factor among those that have led to the increase in construction that has taken place; for this development has made industrial and commercial concerns less anxious to keep their resources liquid, and has given them confidence that new capital can be obtained when required on reasonable terms. We regard the industrial recovery in Great Britain, accordingly, as representing in larger measure than may appear at first sight the fruits of the systematic pursuit of a policy of cheap money during the past year and a half; and in view of the still downward trend of interest-rates and the steady strengthening of business confidence, it seems reasonable to expect that the revival of constructional activity will continue to develop.31. On the other hand, it is in respect of the outlook for constructional activity that there is in our judgment real cause for misgiving as to the success of the American experiment. The setback that has occurred in the United States in the last few weeks does not appear as yet to have assumed really serious dimensions. The pace of the recovery during the early summer was too hot to last, and some recession, as we foreshadowed in our last report, was in any case to be expected, when the Recovery Codes began to operate. The vital question is how far a revival of constructional activity has been developing beneath the &quot;re-stocking &quot; boom which has for the time being lost its impetus. The huge increase in the output of steel, although partly attributable to the revival of automobile production, suggests that there must have been considerable enterprise of a constructional character. On the other hand, there is no sign and little prospect of a revival of building such as has been a marked feature of the British recovery in the past year.32. As regards the future, the conditions prevailing in the United States -offer a less trustworthy basis for capital enterprise than those which prevail in Great Britain. It is true that an inflationary prospect, in which it is generally expected that prices and costs of all kinds are likely to rise in terms of money, is quite consistent with at least a temporary outburst of constructional activity. A constructional boom was, indeed, an important feature of some of the post-war inflations on the Continent. But, at present at all events, the monetary outlook in the United States is one of extreme uncertainty rather than of a decided anticipation of rising prices; and many features of the policy Of the Administration, notably the disposition to insist that the incomes of wage-earners, which mean to the manufacturer his costs of production, must not be allowed to lag behind selling-prices, and the threatening attitude towards public utilities, are not such as to encourage the expectation that capital undertakings will prove remunerative. In the meantime, it has become extremely difficult for industries to obtain fresh capital from the public, owing to the operation oif the new Securities Law governing the flotation of new issues. Against these deterrents to constructional activity of an ordinary commercial character, the -compensating stimulus of the public works programme which is encountering the difficulties and delays which the experience of other countries has shown to be inevitable, seems likely to prove wholly inadequate.33. We remain, therefore, of the opinion which we expressed in our last report, that the solution of the problem of constructional activity is vital to the sustained continuance of the American recovery; and we do not believe that a solution of this problem can be found as a mere by-product of measures designed to increase the purchasing-power of farmers or wage-earners. This possibilityha&apos;s been further diminished since our last report by an unfavourable turn in the prices &apos;of farm products and by an unsatisfactory position in regard to !many crops.
34. In Great Britain, however; the recovery&apos; appears to be soundly based;, and the improvement in the export trade which has occurred during the last few months makes the situation decidedly more encouraging than it was at the time of our last report. The first question that arises is how far, in the absence;, of unfavourable external developments, the recovery is likely to proceed. In this connection, the gravest doubts arise in connection with two industries, cotton and shipbuilding. The position of both these industries is profoundly unsatis-factory; and the outlook for both remains unhopeful. These industries occupy a position of great importance in our national economic life; and any recovery must remain incomplete which does not extend to them.35. The second question that arises is whether the recovery in Great Britain has gathered sufficient strength to be able to withstand adverse repercussions which may come at any moment from abroad. Various possibilities must be borne in mind in this connection; (a) the possibility of a severe and prolonged industrial setback in the UnitedStates;(b) the possibility of a substantial further depreciation in the Americandollar,  as the result of the arrangements lately announced for controlling its gold value; . (c) the possibility that the gold countries may find their position insupport-able and abandon the gold standard.36. Such developments might prejudice the recovery in Great Britain in different ways; and so long as such developments are possible the future outlook must remain uncertain. Subject to contingencies of this character, however, the economic outlook for Great Britain seems to us more hopeful than it has been at any time since the depression began.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.
