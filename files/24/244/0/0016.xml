The King&apos;s Speech on the Opening of Parliament.November 21, 1933.My Lords and Members of the House of Commons :MY relations with foreign Powers continue to be friendly.The central purpose of My Government in international affairs is to promote and to sustain, by every means in their power, peace in the world. With this object in view, My Government will continue to co-operate with other Governments in endeavouring to reach a satisfactory solution of the complicated questions of disarmament in order to achieve a settlement acceptable to all and to attain fruitful results from the prolonged labours of the Disarmament Conference. My Government remain determined to uphold the work of international co-operation by collective action through the machinery of the League of Nations and in all other ways calculated to further good relations between all States and peoples.During the past Session a Joint Committee of both your Houses considered, in conference with delegates from India, proposals for Indian constitutional reform. You will be invited to re-constitute the Committee, and My Ministers hope that the Committee may find it possible to complete their arduous task in time to enable definite proposals, in legislative form, to be laid before you during the coming Session. I am deeply conscious of the burden of responsibility which lies upon all those whose duty it is to guide or to take decisions as to the form of the future government of My Indian Empire, and I pray that wisdom may inform their judgment.The Report of the Royal Commission on Newfoundland is about to be laid before you, and any legislation which may be found necessary in connection with their recommendations will be submitted to you.Members of the House of Commons :The Estimates for the public services will be laid before you in due course.My Lords and Members of the House of Commons :The past year has been marked by a steady growth of confidence in the future prospects of British trade and industry. In the opinion of My Government it is of the first importance that this confidence should be maintained and increased, since it lies at the root of any lasting improvement in the condition of the country.By careful attention to sound principles both in the control of expenditure and in measures calculated to encourage enterprise My Ministers will endeavour to promote the return of the nation, step by step, to conditions which will permit the easing of its present burdens.My Ministers will continue their efforts to create favourable conditions for the export trade, especially by the negotiation of trade agreements. In this way it is hoped that opportunities will be afforded for the development of the cotton, coal and other exporting trades.(926S)
You will be invited to give immediate consideration to a comprehensive Measure which will put the Unemployment Insurance scheme on a sound and permanent footing and will establish a new system for the assistance and welfare of the unemployed outside insurance.My Ministers intend, in conjunction with the Local Authorities, to press forward with the improvement of housing conditions by the clearance or reconditioning of houses unfit for human habitation, and their replacement, when demolished, by dwellings which accord with modern standards and can be let at reasonable rents.Measures dealing with the law relating to betting and gambling, the continuation of a beet sugar subsidy for another year, the reconditioning of working-class houses and regulating the hours of employment of young persons and other conditions in the distributive trades will be submitted to you&apos;.Bills relating to Scotland will be introduced to accelerate the provision of small holdings, to deal with illegal trawling, to amend the poor law, and for other purposes.Other Measures of importance will be laid before you and proceeded with as time and opportunity offer.And I pray that the blessing of Almighty God may rest upon your deliberations.
