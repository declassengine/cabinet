IIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY Off HIS BRITANNIC MAjg-STTS GOVERNMENT).E OR E 1.WAR    0 A B I N E T.f .,-6261,      PROPOSED SCHEME FOR OUT-PI^TOE: DONATIONSsMemorandum by Sir Edwin Cornwall.My attention &quot;has been called during the last day or two to the scheme for the provision of out-of-work donations, to be administered by tho Ministry of labour.     I undorstand that the scheme will operate for a limited period and will apply to all empltyod persons in the sense of persons who, if over 16 years of age, became employed contributors under National Health Insurance at least three months previous to tho date upon which tho scheme comes into operation.     I gather that it is intended that the National Health Insurance contribution cards and tho record cards of employed persons aro to be used under this scheme as a means of Identification and as a proof of the applicanttitle to the issun of the now out-of-work policies.   These arrangements have been the subject of consultation between representatives of my Department an-tho Ministry of Labour since the public announcement of the Govern.. mentre adoption of this scheme, and every effort will bo made to facilitate its operation so far as the use of the machinery of National Health Insurance is concerned,,There is, however, ono point in which the Labour Departmentys scheme needs to be supplemented in order that the financial stab-ility of National Health Insurance shall not be broken clown by the working of the scheme.     During the periods of unemployment for which the proposed donation is paid, no National Health insurance contributions would be payable in the ordinary course, as such contributions normally fall to be paid only in week? of employment.     Tho result would be that vast numbers of persons, running possibly into millions, would fall into serious arrears, which would render them liable to a reduction of, and ultimately to total suspension from, sickness, disablement, and maternity benefits under National Health Insurance,,        The accumulation of arrears on such a vast scale would lead inevitably to! an irrestible demand for the suspension of the arrears provisions, a step which would be impossible both administratively and \%ithin the ,* actuarial basis of the Act.     The only practicable methods by whioh this difficulty could be avoided .would be to supplement.^ the payment of tho out-of-work donation by the payment of tho N appropriate Hoalth Insurance contribution, viz,, 7d. a weok in the case of men, and 6d. a weok in the case of women, for each &apos;Veek in respect of whioh the donation is paid,,     It is estimated that the additional cost involved in this proposal would not exceed 2 per cent, of tho total expenditure involved in the Labour/ DepartmentTs scheme, and application is accordingly being., made to the Treasury for their consent to the provision oxS these additional weekly sums from the Exchequer,     This proposal does not involvo any additional payment in cash to the men and wfemen concernod; it is intended that the contribution cards should bo date-stamped at the Employment Exchanges on each occasion wh^n the donation is paid and the requisite amounts, calculated by reference to the number of such date-stamps, in due course crodited to frthQ Societies concerned - an Exchequer grant being made to the ^Nati^nal Health insurance i*und to enable this to be done.I am convincad that unless this arrangement lo acceded to the financial structure of tho National Health Ift&amp;manoe Acts will be imperilled, and therefore, as the matter is of the greatesturgency,
1-0 fi1:0 Vurgency, I request tho War Cabinet to give their sanction to my proposal, in which the Ministry of Labour has concurred.Although it is not a matter strictly within tho province of my Department, I foci bound to add that the proposal that in&quot; the event of Giclcness the donation should cease to be payable and that the persons concerned should receive only tho National Health Insurance siclaiess benefit, viz.. 10/- a week in the ease of men and 7/&apos;6d; a week in&apos;the case of women, will cause serious hardship in many cases and lead to great dissatisfaction;(Signed), EDWIN CORNWALL,.18th November,. 1918,
