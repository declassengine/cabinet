FOOD PRODUCTION SCHEMES?, IRELAND.

Memorandum prepared in compliance with Chief Secretary&apos;s Minute of 17th March, 1917.

Week ended 6th November, 1918.

The following is a brief statement on the work of the Department during the past week in furtherance of increased Food Production in Ireland:-

LOANS FOR AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENTS.

Seventeen applications for loans for agricultural implements were received by the Department during the past week. The total value of machinery ordered from the beginning of the present year, to date, under the Scheme, amounts to Â£97,376.

COMPULSORY TILLAGE REGULATIONS.

The work of collecting rents from the persons to whom land was set in conacre, on holdings entered on by the Department last spring under the Defence of the Realm Regulations, is proceeding satisfactorily.

The Department&apos;s Advisory Committee on Food Production met on the 6th inst., and had before them the proposals of the Department in regard to the Compulsory Tillage Regulations for the year 1919. These were that steps should be taken to have cultivated in 1919 an area equal to that required for the year 1918, and that accordingly an Order, under the Third Schedule to the Corn Production Act, 1917, should be made obliging occupiers of holdings in Ireland to cultivate in 1919 the same proportion of their arable land as was prescribed under the 1918 Tillage Orders. The Advisory Committee approved these proposals.

The Committee had also under consideration the following amongst other matters bearing on the work of Food Production in Ireland; (a) the supply of feeding stuffs for Irish requirements; (b) the supply of artificial manures, particularly phosphates to be supplied to Irish farmers; (c) the Department&apos;s operations under Defence of the Realm Regulation 2M, in regard to requiring the cleansing of streams and watercourses?, the obstruction of which is a cause of fleeding to adjacent lands. The Advisory Committee adopted unanimously the following resolution which they asked should be transmitted to the Government:-

"That this advisory Committee desire to represent to the Governrment their sense of the disastrous effects upon the agriculture of this country of the limitation on the import of supplies of feeding stuffs and phosphates, amounting in the case of feeding stuffs in Ireland almost to total stoppage, in favour of the imports of frozen meat and bacon; already this limitation has grievously hindered the production of homo-grown? beef, mutton, bacon and milk, and the loss of the farmyard manure involved must react upon the maintenance of tillage, not to speak of its extension; on the other hand the

6/11/18
importation of meat has forced the Ministry of Food to impose on the producers of cattle the ruinous course of taking back their stock from the markets and keeping them losing their condition on the land which should now be stocked with stores for next season; the deliberate opinion of this Committee is that it will be impossible to carry out the purposes of the Corn Production Act unless this policy is altered".

PROGRESS OF THE HARVEST.

The earlier part of the week was favourable for harvesting operations, but towards the end work was retarded by heavy rains. ?hreshing of grain is still in progress in all but the very early districts. The yield from grain crops threshed during the week is reported to have been satisfactory, except in cases where the crops suffered heavy damage in the fields. Threshing operations have been ?reatly facilitated this season by the very large number of additional ?trol-driven and other threshing machines introduced into the country.

Reports indicate that the potato crop is generally yielding ?ell, though from some districts complaints are made regarding an increase in the percentage of diseased tubers, especially in the case of the Champion variety. The lifting of tho mangel crop is now completed ?n most districts. The yield of the crop is variable; in some districts ?it is a good average, but elsewhere the return has been disappointing. ?urnips also are a variable crop, but are said to be growing well at present. A considerable amount of stubble ploughing was got through during the week, but owing to the unfavourable weather conditions little progress could be made with the sowing of winter wheat.

FLAX.

?arvesting. There is still a little flax remaining in the fields, but generally speaking harvesting operations may now be regarded as finished ? the season.

?cutchers&apos; Disputes. There have been a certain number of cases of disputes in mills on the subject of the rates of wages fixed by the Wages ?arbitration Court, but these have invariably been settled by the mill-?wner and his workers without intervention by the authorities.

?ixing of Scutching Charges. The recommendations of the Departmental Committee of Inquiry into this matter, with which the Department concur, have been communicated to the Flax Control Board and the Department of ?nautical Supplies, and the report has been sent for presentation ? Parliament.

FLAX INSTRUCTORS. Ton additional flax instructors who received one ?ear&apos;s special training were appointed during the past week and are ?oing placed in various districts? In Ulster and in County Mayo to ?ive instruction in scutch-mill work.

Twelve fla? apprentices have been selected by ?amination for one year&apos;s training to qualify them for positions as flax instructors, and their course of training is being commenced ?his week.

MAINTENANCE OF LIVE STOCK.

During the period from 29th ult. to 4th inst., inclusive, ?48 applications for licences to slaughter or export heifers, 101 applications for licences to slaughter bulls or bullocks and 157 ?pplications for licences to export milch cows were received.
