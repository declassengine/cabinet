THE G31BRAL TIM3ER POSITION. 97Note by tho Secretary of State for tho Royal Air Force.With reference to Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade, G.T.6Q3S, I circulate a note by the Administrator of Works and Buildings, whose Department alone of those in the Air Ministry, is affected by tho proposals of the Timber Controller.Air Ministry, V/EIR.6th November, 1918.With reference to the Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade upon tho general Timber position, 1 am satisfied that if the recommendation to make an immediate cut of oo,l/&apos;5)l on our indents and demands for timber of all descriptions, means a cut to that extent in indents and demands already issued by this Department, then I am unable to agree, because these demands must be fulfilled to complete work which we have in hand.     If, however, tho recommendation is only to apply to future demands then I am satisfied that wo can readily consent bo reduce the requirements which we have made in the past year by 33.3/3$, Mid in fact, by a much larger percentage than 33.1/3.The Air Council at the last meeting turned down several proposals, for further work of construction, which were then brought forward, thus reducing considerable demands of timber which wo should otherwise have had to make., I have also raised tho question with the Ministry of Munitions whether timber Huts and Buildings at Filling Factories cannot now, in the altered conditions, be spared and handed over to us to meet our requirements, and if this were done then some of our existing demands might be considerably reduced;   otherwise, the position is, that we have buildings in course of construction, and in some cases approaching completion, and these cannot be completed unless wo have the timber for Roofs, etc, so that our indents and demands&apos; for such timber must be fulfilled in full.
