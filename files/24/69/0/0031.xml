Practically all corn crops have now been harvested^ and, in many districts, considerable areas have been planted with autumn corn, which reports show is germinating well*The favourable change in the weather conditions made it possible for autumn cultivation and potato lifting to be proceeded with more rapidly than has been the case during the last few weeks.Potatoes are generally lifting well, and few reports of serious disease in this crop are being receivedc-Progress has also been made in the pulling of roots, the yield of which varies greatly in different districts, though on the&apos; whole it may be regarded as nearer the average than was at one time expected.LOCAL ORGANISATION DIVISION.

The Committee have been authorised to take possession of -a 168 acre farm at Winnington near Northwich which has been-   1,T
indifferently farmed and insufficiently stocked, and of whioh t arable land is reported to bo very foul*    it was suggested to owner occupier that he should let the farm to a practical farmei which, however, he refused to do,    Tho Executive committee wil] therefore, themselves adopt that course.Nottinghamshire *    The committee have been authorised to take possession of part of a 111 acre farm at&apos; Hexgroavo, all of which was formerly under grass.     The owner occupier was required to plough up 49 acres, and on his stating that he was without sufficient labour or machinery to carry out the necessary culth the Executive Committee undertook the work for him.    Harvesting operations were, however, left to the owner, and in consequence his neglect much of the crops have been wasted, and the land has made its adequate contribution to the food supply, Suffolk, West.    The Committee, as stated in the Report for 28th November, 1917, were authorised, with the concurrence of the respective owners, to take possession of 450 acres of Euston Par1 and 100 acres of LIvermere Park, and to undertake the work of cultivation    The results have been most satisfactory both financially and from the point of view of food production, and t! Committee have, therefore, been authorised to take possession (again with the concurrence of the owner) of a further 350 acres. Euston Park, and to proceed with the cultivation. Prosecutions.    A farmer at Ashbury, Berkshire, was prosecuted April for having failed to comply with a cultivation order send upon him in December, 1917.    The defendant pleaded guilty, and&apos;&apos; the Committee did not press for any but a lenient penalty, he m fined the nominal sum of  5, and required to enter into a bondU  100 to complete the required work by 1st September, 1918.    This he failed to do, and was summonsed a vtzek ago by the Executive Committee who applied for forfeiture of the bond.     The defend^ submitted that it had been Impossible, owing-.to bad weather and to scarcity of labour and horsos, to get the work done, and pre duced evidence to prove this.     Tho magistrates accordingly
mitigated the forfeiture to  25 and &amp;5* 5s. costs. The defendant waa, however, required to entor into another bond in  100 to carry out the work required &quot;by tho order before 31st December, 1918..-- Tho owner occupier of a farm at Hurstmoncoux in Bast Sussex was summonsed last August for having failed to comply with a cultivation order served upon him by tho Exocutivo Committoo. Tho case was adjourned (to bo reinstated at seven days&quot; notice) as the defendant promised to endeavour to carry out the Committee^ requirements.    This, however, ho failed to do, and, upon being again summonsed, the magistrates imposed on him a fino of  25 and  5* 5s. costs *A farmer at Hutton Soil and another at Gamblesley,, Cumberland, have been fined  40 and costs and  30 and costs respectively for failure to comply with a cultivation order served upon them hy the Executive Committee.    A farmer at Oaksworth in tho North Riding has been fined  20 and  5. 5s. costs for a similar offence.Damage by Game.   Action under the Rabbits Order is reported from bsbox, Leicester and from Bast and West Sussex.horticulture CJ.TMBgd JffXJffjj&amp;Nv Hortioultural Sub-committee os.    A speoial inspection was carried out last week of the work done by Horticultural Sub-Committees In the midland counties.    The Sub-Committees are carrying out their duties in an energetic and satisfactory manner and welcomed the opportunity thus afforded them to discuss the programme of work required for this autumn, and next spring. General..   A beginning has been made with the work of providing technical instruction among small garden and allotment holders. Technical Inspectors are arranging to hold conferences with horticultural experts in.each county so that a uniform system of lectures and instruction on cultivation, soil manuring, etc., can be given.
Provision of Land for Allotments.    During the week 29 local authorities have agreed to acquire 303 acres (3,379 allotments), including 50 acres at West Bromwlch, 39 acres at Nottingham and acres at Chalfont St. Giles, Bucks.,   At-Pun-bridge Wells 80$ of the 7*600 householders have cultivated gardens, while there are also 2,700 allotments holders.    80$ of the    750 householders of Feckenham, Worcester have gardens of 300 square yards, and, in addition, there are 16 allotment holders who cultivate between them 42 acres of land. Fruit Section.    Fruit plantations in Somerset and Norfolk have been inspected during the past week.   There is room for improven in thinning out old trees and combating pests in the cider appl6 orchards in West Somerset.Marketing Section.    The number of counties supporting registere societies or completely organised for the purpose of marketing, is now 24.    11 counties are preparing to register societies.Progress has been made during the week in Huntingdon and Peterborough.    In the county of Rutland the Horticultural Sub-Committee have been successful In collecting produce from villages and disposing of it in various ways, principally to the Royal Infirmary, Leicester.TECHNICAL DIVISION. Ear Cockles in Wheat.   In a recent press notice the Department advised farmers not to sow wheat infested with &quot;ear cockles&quot;, si a comparatively slight infestation may seriously reduce the yiel of the crop.    Prom samples received at the Seed Testing Station however, It is evident that cockle-infested seed is fairly prevalent in certain districts, and,experiments have, therefore) been carried out to ascertain how far cockles may be removed from wheat by the simple process of floating them out in water. The results show that most, if not all, of the cockles may be removed if the grain is kept stirred under water from 40-50 min&quot;
This method has, therefore, been brought to the notice of farmers, with the suggestion that it should be adopted in cases where strong reasons exist for sowing cockle-Infested seed. Plant Pestso (1) A visit was made by two of the Technical Advisors to a farm in Hertfordshire, where oats on grass land, broken up for the 1918 harvest, were, it was thought, entirely destroyed by &quot;wireworms.   This year there are indications on the second corn crop (wheat) that wireworms are also present In considerable numbers, and if the necessary arrangements can be made with the owner, an experiment will be instituted to test the value of stimulating manures in combating the attacks of this pest*(2)   Experiments are being arranged in Suffolk with regard to methods of preventing or controlling the ravages of flea beetles, with special reference to the species that attacks mangels,LABOUR DIVISION,Harvest Labour,    The number of soldiers specially released for harvest work and still out on farms is 3,717.The military authorities have been asked to extend the furlough of these men for a further period of 14 day3, owing to the backward state of the potato harvest due to the recent unfavourable weather.In addition to these soldiers, 5,325 prisoners of war are out on harvest work under the migratory gang scheme. Soldier Labour,   1,376 of the skilled ploughmen to be released on two months&apos; agricultural furlough, to assist with the autumn cultivations, have arrived at distribution centres and have been sent out on to farms.The. returns received from distribution centres show that substitutes have nov been provided for the whole of those men in Agricultural Companies who have recently been placed in Category &quot;A&quot;.    Of these men 1,185 have been withdrawn up to the present date for general service.
Belgian labour. A few Belgian.-agriculturists who have recently been brought over from Holland, by the Ministry of Labour, have been placOd on farms in this country during the pact week.Women1 a jfranch.Training, arid Employment, &apos;   Owing to the lateness of the potato harvest this yeer in various parts of the country5 there has U some dislocation of arrangements for the transfer of labour. Difficulties have been experienced in some districts owing to t impossibility of women, who are engaged on potato lifting, continuing to live in their summer billets which are unsuitable this time of the year.In view of the increased cost of living, the minimum weekly wage guaranteed to members of the Land Army has been rail from 20/- to 22/6&amp;. per week.Reports are continually received of the good work don by women tractor drivers.CULTIVATION DIVISION. Tractor Scheme.    The following statement shows the position wi regard to the provision of tractors, machinery and implements f the week ended 2nd November, 1918:-No. consigned   Total No, daring week.     with countTractors............... 4 4,154(withdrawn 14)Ploughs ................ - 5,367Trailer boxes.......... 32 1,006During the week ended 18th October, 21,378 acres were ploughed, 257 acres were cross-ploughed, and 2,062 acres werecultivated.An arrangement has now been made with the Agricultural Machinery Department of tho Ministry of Munitions by which the Food Production Department are enabled to obtain half of the stp of Titan spare part3 at present held in this country by the International Harvester Company.   A supply of Titan spare parts&apos; recently arrived from America in fulfilment of a contract placed
by the Department through the Ministry of Munitions some months p.go.     It is, therefore, hoped that there will,.in future, be less difficulty experienced in obtaining spare parts for this type of tractor.Steam-Tackle.    The acreage dealt with during the past week is as follows!-   ploughed 10,652 acresi cultivated 2,891 acres, harrowed 46 acres, mole-drained 30 acres, rolled 100 acres.   Total 13,719 acres.SUPPLIES DIVISION. Lime.,    The quantity of lime used for agricultural purposes appears to have increased materially daring the past twelve months.    The returns received by the Department from 160 makers in England and Wales show a total of 392,000 tons delivered for agricultural use in the year ended September last, as compared with 283,000 tons in the preceding twelve months, (an increase of nearly 40$). Blast Furnace ;Flue Dust.    Flue dust now appears to be established as&apos;a source of potash.for agriculture, and, although the sales are not&apos;very large, they form a useful addition to the limited supplies available for the potato and flax crops.    The total quantity of flue dust distributed in the United Kingdom in the year ended 30th September last was 21,625 tons, estimated to contain about 1,600 tons of potash (K 20).    This is equivalent to about 13,000 tons of kainit.Census of Seed Stocks.     In order to ascertain to what extent the supplies of seed will be sufficient to meet the home demand during the forthcoming season, and to enable an estimate to be made of the exportable surplus, it is proposed to obtain a return on 1st December of the stocks of seeds held by seedsmen in the United Kingdom.   A similar return is being made in the United States of America, and it is hoped to extend the census to France and Italy.   These, returns, it is hoped, will serve as a basis for regulating the interchange of seed between.the four countries.Unless international action is taken, it is feared that the
demand during the first year of peace from all&quot;countries may so greatly exceed the supply that prices will he forced up to prohibitive levels.Seed Wheat. The Department have novi shipped Between 400 and 5 quarters of selected seed wheats of the varieties &quot;Browick&quot;, &quot;Victor&quot;, &quot;Squarehead Master&quot;, &quot;Little Joss&quot;, &quot;Yeoman&quot; and &quot;Fent for planting on General headquarters farms in France. This who( has been carefully re cleaned and tested, and the consignments o. each variety represent a good standard of seed. 1 Wart Disease.of Potatoes. Nearly all the local authorities in England and Tales have now. made arrangements for the display itf their districts of the illustrated wart disease poster setting forth the more important provisions of tho ;Wart Disease of Pota Order, 1918. Reports, received from a number of centres indicatfe that the posters have, been well distributed, and many cases of wart disease have been notified as the result.   ;   &apos; ;.v-v       A survey carried,out in the county of Denbigh has revealed the presence -pf/jnuch unreported disease. Spraying.   During the .past week reports have&quot;been received of potatoes which were apparently sound on :lifting becoming diseas during storage.   This concerns especially the varieties &quot;Eritii Queen&quot; and &quot;Arran Chief&quot;.I am, ,,... ;:;.;     v .      ... ; Sir, &apos; . ; ;,, .
