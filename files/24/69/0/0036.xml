S. R. 51.MILITARY        NAVAL DEKOBILIGAXIOM AND THZ FUTURE OF :tEC^UlTlKGMemorandum by the Minister of National Service. (Ref, G.T.6151. and 6171.)-illI wish to deal shortly with one moat important point of detail with igard to the proposed powers of the Army Council to retain such men as :oy may require after the expiration of the present Statutory powers,Any Bill should empower the army Council to call up for service with g Forces during such limited period as may be determined upon, all :iily qualified practitioners in order to expedite the demobilisation &apos;the older and more fully trained Uedical Officers and to safeguard le Interests of the large number of Medical Officers who will not be mobilised till after the ratification of Peace Terms.The medical Students thus affected are members of 0.T.Cs., but I am ivised that it is very doubtful that this would be sufficient to hold mi to service of the nature proposed.     At present almost all medical indents from, the 2nd year of study onwards are specially exempted until leir medical training is completed, and as soon as they are qualified ,ey are, if physically fit,, callad to the Colours as He&amp;ical Officers,It should be noted that tho opportunity given to these men to aiify as medical practitioners is due.to the protection from Military rvice afforded to them by the Stats in the interests of the State; it therefore not unreasonable that the&quot;State shouTd haveThe first claimtheir services after qualification.Furthermore, unless such power is taken to call up these young men they qualify during the demobilisation period, there will be nothing prevent thorn from obtaining appointments and practices which in common htice ought to fall to medical practitioners of local standing who are JBainod In the Army,     In short, the calling up of the newly qualified pical practitioners is in effect the necessary corollary to the retention-Ifei In the Services of established medical practitioners,A Memorandum dealing in detail w\th this subject, among others, has&apos; 1 ;?eady been submitted to tho Ministry of Reconstruction in accordance jp rar Cabinet Decision No,412, Kin&apos;,5; and a copy has been sent to the m Office,     As, however, it is not mentioned in Lord Miner&apos;s Memoran-m, I wish to draw special attention to the subject, as I consider it gibe vital to the proper demobilisation of medical practitioners,I   Tho problem, of recruiting in the future is indirectly raised in the 1 oranda submitted by the Secretary cf State for War and the Second Sea 1 if and I wish to submit certain aspects of. this subject for the con-I pration of the War Cabinet,I Up to the time whon an armistice is signed, the i/linistry of National iHco will continue to obtain men for the three Services as heretofore.The extent to which, if at all, recruiting is to be continued under I Military Service Acts after an armistice is signed and until its con-lions have been fulfilled, is a question upon which it will bo necessary
\o obtain a decinion from the War Cabinet as soon a3 the positionIt i3 presumed that such a decision would state the date upon which recruiting under the present statutory powers should cease absolutely..I propose that from the date-so fixed by the Tar Cabinet the Minis, try of national Service should cease to recruit and that the three Ser-riLe.es should be responsible for obtaining their own personnel by volun-lary enlistment only for periods to be determined by the Departments -one erne 1.The Admiralty will readily be able to resume exclusive responaibil-Ity for naval recruiting as they still possess thoir peace time recruit-ing establishments and staff.Tho formation of a recruiting service for the Royal Air Force should lot be a long or a difficult task, as the foundations are already In lastence in their Reception Depots.The Army Council will, of course, decide upon the form that a new [Directorate of Recruiting shall take and the requisite organisation at laadquarters and in Commands. There are, however, two details to which Iwould like to draw attention. It will be imperative that the pro-mine ial organisation for recruiting shall be ready for work as soon as possible after an armistice is signed, in order that the Recruiting De-prtment of the Ministry of National Service may be demobilised at tho far liest possible date after the cessation of compulsory recruitment.I     In tho selection of the staff for the post-bellum recruiting ser-lice, I wish to press the claims of certain members of my present staff. She &apos;Var Office will no doubt take over such members of the pro-war re-limit in&amp; staff, 7* hot her officers, N.C.03, men, pensioner-recruiters or fesioner-conductors, as are now serving under the Ministry of National ;irvicc and are willing to continue recruiting duties.   In addition I kot that in making up the staff required, priority will be given to ilsabled soldiers and men now in the employment of this Ministry who are Billing to continue in the recruiting service.If the proposals outlined above or similar methods are adopted, the fcult &quot;-ill bo that so soon as recruiting ceases to be compulsory and Iftomes purely voluntary, the Navy, Royal Air Force, and the Army, will J responsible for obtaining, their o*n personnel and the Ministry of fttional Service will be in a position to terminate their recruiting fcivities at the earliest possible date.I    I am instructing my Department to enter into negotiations iifced-Btely with the Admiralty, the War Office and the Air Ministry in order * arrange provisionally the necessary details of a transfer on the IWo lines.A.
