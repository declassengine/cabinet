t) (JCOPY NO.5.Headquarters,Independent Force, Royal Air Force.The Secretary, Air Ministry, LONDON.In continuation of my I.F.G.79/S of the 1st of September, 1918, I submit the following report on the operations carried out by the Independent Force, R.A.F., during September, 1918.Weather. The weather conditions generally throughout themonth have been unsatisfactory.     During the period of the useful phases of the moon, the conditions for night flying were particularly bad.     Strong winds, low clouds, and much rain prevented many of the long distance objectives being reached.     On 19 days and 1(3 nights no operations were carried out owing to adverse weather conditions.Increase of On the 22nd of September No.45 Squadron, equippedStrength,   with Sopwith Camels, arrived from Italy.    This Squadronis located at BETTONCOURT.     It is net intended to operate with this Squadron over the lines until it has been re-equipped with the Sopwith Snipe and 4-1 hours supply of petrol.No.110 Squadron (D,HP9a), which arrived from England on the 31st of August, carried out its first raid on the 14th September, and on the 24th completed a most successful raid on FRANKFURT.No,115 Squadron (Handley Pages), which also arrived on the 31st of August, commenced operations on the night of the 16/17th September.Distant . During the month, the following long distanceRaids.        raids have been carried outBy day     - STUTTGART, FRANKFURT, MANNHEIM (twice).By night - FRANKFURT, KARLSRUHE, MANNHEIM, KAISERSLAUTERN, COLOGNE, BONN, MAINZ.I append brief details of some of the above-mentioned raids.(&amp;) STUTTGART.   On September 15th, No.55 Squadron attacked the Daimler Works at STUTTGART from 17,000 feet.   Good bursts were observed on the objective.     This Squadron was heavily attacked and destroyed two hostile machines. All our machines returned,(b) FRANKFURT.   0n the night of the 16/17th September one machine of No. 97 Squadron attacked FRANKFURT from 2,500 feet.On the 25th of September, No,110 Squadron reached FRANKFURT with 11 D.IL9a&apos;s, and dropped over lj tons of bombs from 17,000 feet on to the objective,     They were opposed by a very large number of hostile machines, two of which they destroyedc     Four of our machines did not return, and in addition, one observer was killedm and one observer and one pilot were wounded.   This was the first long distance raid carried out by this Squadron. See photograph &quot;B&quot;.ItF.G.79/S. ISA-
(c) MANNHEIM. and LUDWIGSMyEN.   On the 7th of September, 11 ^iao^Tnei oFi$o* 9^13quadi?pn. and 10 machines of No.. 104 Squadron attacked tho Bad is oho- Anilin und Soda-Pabrik from 10,000 feett     The formations of the two Squadrons released their bombs almost. simultaneous lye     Over two tons of bombs fell in and around the Works j, and extensive damage must have been caused. Both Squadrons were heavily attacked throughout their course, and in the fighting we lost four machines, One of the enemy was destroyed and others were driver, down out of control.On the 16th of September, 5 machines of No,  5 Squadron attached the Lanz Wirka at MANNHEIM, dropping their bombs from 10.000 feet,    Very little hostile opposition was encountered, and all the machines which reached the target returned-     One. machine was forced to land with engine trouble in hostile territory on the way to the objective,Cn the night of the 20/213t of September,one machine of No;ICO Squadron attacked the Lanz Works at MENNHEIM.     Clouds obscured the objective just after the bombs were released,     See photograph(d) KARLSFUHE.     On the night of the 15/16th September, olii&quot;machine of Noe&apos;215 Squadron dropped sixteen 112 it. and ton 25 lb* bombs on KARLSRsjfiB Looks and Railways, The attack was made from 1,500 feet, and 17 direct hits on various buildings on the wharves are claimed;On the night of the 20/glst September; three machines of No .97 Squadron were detailed to attack the Gas Works at KARLSRUHE,   Two machines returned with engine trouble; and the third reached the object and dropped bombs from 5,000 feet.(e) MAINZ.   On the night of the 15/16th of September, Three machines of Nof.97 Squadron started for Mainz.. Two machines reached the objective and dropped their&apos; bombs with good results on the main railway and main system of railways.(f), COLOGNE and BONN,   On the night of the 16/17th Septet; we lost  *Lhandley Pages..    Five of these, detailedf COLOGNE and MANNHEIM, were probably unable to return .to our lines in the face of a strong South-westerly wind which increased in velocity after the machines had left their aerodrome.     One of these missing machines, with engine trouble,, landed in Holland, having dropped his bombs at BONN.     Unofficial German reports mention COLOGNE as being bombed during this night and cf our machines being heard in the nelghW hood of DUSSELDORPo(g) SI???$ his?JL    1110 Railways were attacked by three machines on&quot;the night of the 14/15tho-    The attack W made from 2500 feet, and an ammunition train appears to have been blown upcThe Munition Factory at KAISERSLAUTERN was attacked by 12 machines of No,55 Squadron on the 25th,     Very heavy fighting took place, in the course of which two hostile machines were destroyed and two driven down out of control,     We lost throe machines and had two observers killed    and one pilot wounded

(approximately) on the 12th September,1918, orders were received from the 1st American Army, I that the attack was to commence that morning at five
Mt 4 *o&apos;look, after a short artillery preparation.     The weather conditions were still very unfavourable for bombing, but as soon as it was light, attempts were i to bomb METZ-SABLQNS and COURCELLES Railway Junction Most of the pilots were unable to see their objeotiv. owing to clouds and rain, and only a few bombs wero dropped on COURCELLES and VERNY,At the end of the day, the American Army wa reported to have gained all its objeotives for that day, including THIAUCOURT.During the night of the 12/13th, both METZ. SABLONS and COURCELLES were heavily attacked, about 5^ tons of bombs being dropped.During the period of the continuation and exploitation of the attack, until the night of 16/17 September, constant bombing attacks were made on Rai and Aerodrome targets which affected the battle. 32 tons were dropped at METZ.Enemy Scouts for fche most part were compare tively inactive, except on the 15th September, when f machines were heavily engaged over METZ.Table A gives certain data connected with 11 operations.A photograph of METZ (&quot;II0) shews the results tf an attack by Nos.97, 100 and 216 Squadrons, The large grain warehouse alongside the Western branch oi the triangle has, been badly damaged. Two engine she have been hit. There are twelve direct hits on the Railway, fifteen within the triangle, and eighteen ot bursts close to the Station, triangle and railway.Qo-operation On the 23rd September a letter was received with French from Marshal Foch, indicating that French and America and American troops would shortly carry out a combined attack froi Armies in VERDUN to the River Suippes, and requesting that the their Independent Force should co-operate by bombing the attacks on  Railway Junctions at MEZIERES - CHARLEROI.    This co the front *  operation was promised.

The day-flying machines had hard fight in over METZ, and destroyed two E.A, and shot down onefl of control. Six of our machines, however, failed to return. , ,On the 27th, 28th, 29th, and 30th September bombing operations were possible, on account of tho weather.On the night of the 30th September/Ootober bombs were- dropped at MEZIERES, METZ-SABLONS, and PHS Aerodrome.
ISOIncreasehostileaerialactivityduringSeptemberin During the month, on all raids, both short anddistant, marked increase of activity in hostile Scofcts has been experienced.     Concentrations of 20 - 30 machines have been frequently encountered.     The areas over which flighting has taken place are t-SAARBURQcd)- SAARGEUMINES     LiORHANGE.

As soon as the formation shows the slightest inclination to straggle, all efforts are concentrated on the lagging machines,.     Two s eaters are to be seen with the single seaters. but seldom fight. It appears that Scout barrages have boon organised at regular distances in depth from the front, and also over the objectives&quot;\The most common types of machines new en-countered   by our formations are the Fokker DrVIIs,Pfalz and Halberstadts. also been seen.Siemen Schukert Scouts haveThe quality of hostile pilots is most marked.
