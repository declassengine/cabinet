Mr. Ben Tillett.The pressure- that is&apos; bein&apos;* put on individual Members of Parliament to promise increases&quot; of pensions is already very great.   At the- coming election it will be enormous. The-danger is that bodies of discharged men will go from one candidate to another at the election and put their support up to auction to the highest bidder in the.matter of Pensions.   The only way to stop this is to make all parties equallyi and jointly responsible,, and the machinery we suggest &quot; or trTTa is&quot;;to set / &quot;
up a Select Committee of the House, of all Parties, who possibly might(a) (As to Policy) Consider and report on Poneions&quot;questions such as general increases, and so act as a huffor for the Pensions Minister, on questions of Pension policy, especially with regard to largo increases.--I(b) (As to Administration)   This Select -\ Committee must in any &quot;case &quot;ais o have power to supervise the administration of the Pensions Ministry, send for the Minister, and report to the House - on&apos;the lines recommended for Indian   Affairs by tho Montagu Report, (paragraph 295, page 236).This would ensure in the House, a body of well-informed opinion on Pensions, of a non-party character, which will be of great value,,Yours sincerely, (S i gne d )C. A MONTAGUE BARLOW.If you feel able to give or indicate a favourable reply on these lines, I will raise the matter on Monday on the 3rd Reading of the Consolidated Fund Billo
