AMD HggETHEjggT OF THE FORCES. (Memorandum, circulated by the Minister of Reconstruction).I. (j) DEMOBILISATION OF THE A&apos;RI&apos;.Y. 13N0VI9I8The Committee on the Demobilisation of the army was appointed by the Reconstruction Committee in May, 1913,under the Chairmanship of l!r. Montagu, with the following terms of reference:-&quot;To consider and report upon the arrangements for the return to civil employment of officers and men serving in the lard forces of the Crown at the end of the war&quot;,: The Committee presented two Interim Reports.(il) The First Inter    Report made the following recommendations which were approved by the Government as a basis of the- Committee&apos;s future work.(a) That the State should grout, to each soldier on demobi1i sat i on -(1) free conveyance to his home from the place of discharge j(2) working furlough with full pay and allowances for four weeks (during.; which separation allowances should continue to be paid) whether or not the recipient Is industrially employed?(3) A special war gratuity in addition to. the ordinary service gratuity (see p.7);;&apos;    ,(4) a free unemployment insurance policy forone year,(b)    That the existing machinery of the. EmploymentExchanges, suitably strengthened and extended:, -should be the means.by which ex-soldiers, should be assisted in obtaining civil employment.In order that the Exchanges might be brought -into the closest possible relation with industry, the Committee proposed that a Central Advisory Committee, Imown as the Labour Resettlement Committee consisting, In the main, 0;&apos; employers find e. :ployed in. equal numbers &quot;  should be attached to the Employment Department ofthe Board of Trade (now the Ministry of Labour), and &apos; that Local Advisory Coon It tees   similarly-constituted should be attached to the Exchanges in each large town or area.
(c)    Eiat the Civil Liabilities Committee 3hould be kept in existence fop a period of at least two years after the war in order to provide assistance for those men whose reasonable claims would not be met by a grant of free unemployment insurance.(ill) The Second Interim Report.of the Committee on the demobilisation of the Army, recommended as follows:-(a) Negotiations should be undertaken at the earliest possible date with the Allied and neutral Governmtuta concerned with a view to obtaining port and other facilities for demobilisation puroowes (see page 3, para. 2 (f) of G.T. 6047).(b) Legislation, authorising the payment of unemployment benefit should provide for a flat rate of 10/- per week as a minimum.(c) The unemployment insurance policy should run from the end of the month1 s furlough during which ,the soldier will be in receipt of full pay&quot;and allowances.(d) The statutory right to claim priority of employment with their previous employers should be conferred on soldiers generally, subject to specified conditions.(e) Demobilisation should be carried out, subject to military exigencies, by individuals and not by units, according to the requirements of trade and industry.    Approximately equal numbers ofthe forces at home and abroad should bo demobilised day by day.(f) An Interdepartmental Cammitteo of representatives of the War Office and the Ministry of Labour should sit during the period of demobilisation In order to settle the order of priority.(g) The Civil Liabilities Committee should be continued in existence after the war for the purpose of granting special assistance to officers and men in like circumstances whose reasonable claims would not be met by unemployment Insurance, and that the Committee should prepare a scheme as soon as possible (see G.T. 6047, page 4, para.5).(h) An Appointments Board for officers and men of like standing   should be established under the control of the Ministry of Labour to co-operate.  with the existing University Appointments Board and other approved bodies.(IV) As a result of the recommendations contained inthe First Report, a War Office Demobilisation Committee ande Ministry of Labour Demobilisation Procedure Committee
...... -,.,.i,tiwore appointed to work out in detail the military and civilian 3ides of the problem, and their Reports were available for the Demobilisation of the Amy Committee, before the latter presented its Second Report.(v) The War Office Demobilisation Committee adopted two main principles:-(a) That the dispersal should take place by drafts of individuals in *hc order of priority demanded by industrial requirements and not by military units.(b) That there should be a gradual reduction of all units to the cadre strength necessary for taking charge of and bringing beck the regimental equipment, stores and animals.(VI) The scheme as workod out provides that, in thecase of men serving overseas, they would be selected as required from their units in accordance with the abiiiveprinciples and sent in parties with only their arms and personal equipment to concentration camps.    Drafts made up in concentration Camps and Embarkation Camps (in militaryCollecting Places in the case of men from units in theUnited Kingdom) proceed intact to Dispersal Stations, ofwhich there will be 25 in the United Kingdom.     It would follow that each man is sent to the Dispersal Stationallotted to foed the *u*o*. to which he wishes to proceed on demobilisation, irrespective of the regiment inwhioh he is serving on demobilisation, except in certain special cases.    On reaching the Dispersal Statidh eachman would(1) hand in his arms and equipment and produce his dispersal certificate, giving all particulars with regard to his individual case, which would have been supplied to him fcy his commanding Officer.   Men from Home units, however, will not bring their arms and equipment.(2) receive a railway ticket to his home;(3) hand in his active service pay-bookj- &apos;    (4) receive an adveneo of pay;
(5) receive a &quot;Protect, on and Identity Certificate&quot; in exchange for his dispersal certificate?(6) receive an out-of-work donation policy *(7) be marched as one of a party to the station, and entrained to his final destination^ being given 28 days furlough.(VII) At this point the scheme prepared by^ the Ministryof Labour Demobilisation Procedure Committee comes into play, and it is necessary to indicate the order ofdemobilisation which was subsequently decided upon.    Itis as follows:-(1) Demobilizers, i.e. those required in their military or civil capacity to enable the work of demobilisation to be carried out.(2) Pivotal men, I,e, those men in the various industries without whom the bulk of the men to be employed cannot get to work effectively.(3) Men enlisted on attestations under which they have still more than two years to serve with tho Colours.(4) Men who have definite jobs waiting for them on their return, hereafter referred to as &quot;slip men&quot;, In the order of priority based on the needs of industry.(5) Men who have not got definite jobs waiting for them but saose employment in civil life is in an Industry which, because it is of high national importance from the po*nt of view of reconstruct tlon, is likely to be able to provide work for them immediately,(6) Other non-slip men in the order of importance of their civil employment.(7) The cadres, some of which will, however, be returned concurrently with the above groups.Within each group preference will be given, as far as possible, to married men, long^service men and time-expired soldiers.The actual ojt*dcr of industrial priority is now being worked oul? by an Inter-departmental Committee sitting at the Ministry ol Labour,(VTII) The scheme prepared by the Ministry of Labour provides tha^, before demobilisation begins, every man should be reouireo, to, fill up a form giving particulars
h ti t.of his previous employment, etc.    These forms will he collected and forwarded to the Employment Department of the Ministry of Labour at the Claims and Record Office, Kew, where they will be sorted according to the Employment Exchanges within the areas in which the merJs home addresses lie.     In the case where a man states that his emplojrer has promised to keep his place open for him, this statement will be checked by reference to the Employer, and if it is found to be correct, the release slip at the bottom of the form will be returned to the man&apos;s Commanding Officer.    That man then incomes a &quot;slip man&quot;.    The same thing will happen where a job is found for a man although it had not been previously promised.s   On arrival at his home the soldier will obtain from the Exchange or Local Agency a card of introduction to the employer with whom employment has been found for him, or if such employment has not yet been found, fuller particulars will be obtained of his qualifications and special steps will be taken to find employment for him,(DC) In close co-operation with the Employment Exchange there will be Local Advisory Committees, of which 250 are now constituted, to whom the ex-soldier will be able to apply for any information and advice In connection with demobilisation, employment or training.    These Local Advisory committee os ore representative of all the industries of the   district and of employers and workpeople in equal numbers.    Before demobilisation begins they will have made arrangements for appointing for each of the larger and well-organised industries of the locality a Trade Sub-Committee which will assist in finding employment for men and women in the industry concerned.    They may also have appointed a general Sub-Committee to undertake similar functions to
those of the Trade Suh-committee before in  respect of the smaller and. less organised industries of the locality. In those cases in which a District Council or a Joint Standing Industrial Council, or an Interim Industrial Re construct I on Committee, or a Local Technical /-dyi^ory Committee (disabled soldiers and sailors) for the industry concerned exists, the Local Advisory Committee will have approached the existing body in order to ascertain whether they would be willing to,nominate members for the Trade Sub-Committee.    By this means it is hoped that the Local Advisory Committee may be kept in the closest toucV with the industrial requirements, not only of its own locality, but also of the country-as a whole...    . ii   i..........i   .1-...........     ll..........m.iThis subject was dealt with by a Sub-Committee of the Demobilisation of the Army Committee, which, presented two Reports.The First Report recommended the creation of a special organisation to deal with the resettlement of officers in civil life, entirely separate both with regard to premises and staff from the Employment Exchanges of the Ministry of Labour,- and the Second Report Investigated the best means of establishing such an organisation to deal with ex-offlorrs, and the principles on which their resettlement could best be effected.    The Government decided that the responsibility for the control of this work was to rest with the Ministry of Labour, and a special branch has already been formed, and is dealing with the cases of officers discharged before general
demobilisation.     In conjunction, with. this branch there is an Officers Resettlement Committee which includes representatives of the principal professional societies with several men possessing general experience of business and commerce, representatives of the Universities and of unofficial Associations interested in the training and employment of ex-officers.    Attached to this body there is a Training Sub-Committee on which the various Departments concerned are represented.    The Training Committee is now working out schemes of training which include the provision of financial help at the public expense where a good case can be made out,    Other recommendations of the Officers Resettlement Sub-Committee are referred to on page 4 of G,T.f5047.The War Cabinet while accepting in principle the recommendations of the Second Interim Report of the Army Demobilisation Committee, referred the question of the re-instatement of ex^soldiers and the rate of unemployment insurance for discussion between the Ministryof Reconstruction, War Office o,nd Ministry of Labour.. The action taken in connection with these matters and other recommendations of the various Committees referred tii above are dealt with in more detail below under the various heads to which they belong.
MOIII REINSTATEMENT.The Army Demobilisation Committee in their Second Interim Report recommended that legislation should be introduced, providing that any man who was in the employment of an employer on the 4th AugU3t, 1914, and remained in such employment until ho joined the Army, should upon his return have the right to be reinstated by that employer to his original grade at the current trade union rate of wages.    These proposals were discussed, but were found to be impracticable.    Accordingly in the original draft of the War Pledges Bill, which was prepared by an Interdepartmental Conference of the Ministry of Munitions, Ministry of Labour and the Ministry of Reconstruction, a clause nas Included, providing to soldiers the right of priority of re-employment,-   This clause has, however, been omitted from the later drafts of the War Pledges Bill.    It is essential that it should form part of the special Bill which will confer on the Ministry cf Labour the necessary powers in connection with Resettlement,    The right of priority was already secured in the case of employees In controlled Establishments unddr Schedule 11, (3) of the Munitions of Far Act, 191&amp;&quot;.IV. -OUT-OF-WORK DONATION,The principle of out-of-work donation having been accepted by the Government, details were discussed at several Conferences of tho Departments concerned and a flat rate with supplementary allowances for children was recommended for the approval of the War Cabinet.    This scheme was to apply to all men who had served overseas who were discharged before demobilization as well as those who were demobilized at the end of the war.    This proposal was approved by the War Cabinet in principle, leaving the actual amount to be settled by the Ministry of Reconstruction and the Treasury in consultation .
MlUee GUT/ 6047, ^^S^(b)).The War Cabinet decided -at&quot; the.^^ame-tijae-that-the question of extending out-of-work donation to Womo^s Corps should be considered by the Departments concerned, and at a series of Conferences a scheme was agreed upon which is detailed in-G.T. 6047.    These recommendations are now covered by the decision of the Cabinet Committee on Demobilization In regard tc free unemployment donation.V. IAKD SETTMIEM1.Proposals were formulated by this Department in consultation with the board of Jsrioulture, which were referred by the Wax1 Cabinet to a special Cabinet Committee. (G.T.6047 page 3, para. 2(c)) A Bill giving effect to these proposals in so far as they relate tfc the provision of land for Small Holdings and Allotments was introduced by Mr. Prothero on Uov.7.VI. DEMOBILISED APPRENTICES.A special investigation was made by the Ministry of Reconstruction and Ministry of Labour into the question of apprenticeships which had been interrupted by War service and   as a result of personal enquiries among organizations of employers and employees, a scheme was prepared and agreed upon with the Departments concerned.    This scheme, which provided for special grants in order that the wage usually paid to an apprentice may be increased to such an extent as to persuade the returning soldier to resume apprenticeship, was approved by the Home Affairs Committee and a Bill is being drafted by the Ministry of Labour.   (G.T.6047, Page 3, para 2 (e))ra&apos;   METHOD Off FAYLIENT OF WAR GRATUITIES AMD ARREARS OF PAY.The Army Demobilisation Committee in their First interim Report recommended that there should be a special war gratuity In addition to the, ordinary service gratuity, and that the Treasury and the War Office should work cut the details of payment.
The method..of p&amp;ymerrtrof war gratuition&quot;and. arrears of pay were not determined in the Army Demobilization Committee&apos;s Reports, but at a Departmental Conference held subsequently it was agreed that the best method of payment of all monies due to a man on demobilization would be as followsEach man receives  2 in cash on leaving his dispersal station.    The balance of pay due to him, his current pay and allowances during the period of 28 days furlough, his clothing allowance and hl3 service gratuity will be lumped together &amp;nd paid In three equal Instalments. ,War Gratuities trill be paid by means of special SavIng?5Bank accounts, subject   to further consideration between Departments concerned of the question whether this method of payment should bo applied to the whole gratuity or only to tho minimum of  5, leaving the balance, if any, to be paid in cash. The question of the stage at which the Savinga^ank book should be issued was left open.    It appears that the amount, etc. of war gratuity and the terminal gratuities had not yet been decided. (Sep. G.T. 6047, page 3, para 2. (a)).GKNERAL   MOTES. VIII. DEMOBILIZATION OF THE NAVY.The principles set cut in the First and Second Interim Report of the Army Demobilisation Committee have been adopted to suit the special conditions of the Kavy.    Thus tie sailor will be discharged direct from his ship or depot, and the &quot;&quot; method of payment of gratuities and arrears of pay due on demobilisation will differ somewhat from that adopted for the Army.    The fact that the Admiralty are represented both on the Demobilisation of the Forces Co-ordination Committee and on the Civil Re-settlement Co-ordination Committee, secures that the
(X11A)     DeI;iOBILX ATIOI-T OF VM la HOSPITAL.If a man in sufficiently recovered to be regarded as a convalescent case he will proceed in the ordinary way to the Dispersal Station nearest Ms ovm home. If a man Is not sufficiently recovered for this course to be taken, the hospital in which he is receiving treatment will be regarded as the Dispersal Station, and he will there receive on demobilisation -1. a Protection and. Identity Certificate.2&apos;. A Railway ear-rant to his home3. A cash payment4. An out-of-Work Donation policy. 5. A ration book.( 113)   REPATRIATION OF U.S.A.- TROOPS.The British Government has no responsibility of any kind in this connection, except in so far as arrangements may be made for the distribution of the available shipping.
schemes for the two services are k&apos;ept as ; ar as possible on I        parallel lines.iK*   DEMOBILISATION OF THE AIR FORCE.The plans already adopted for the demobilisation of the Army will be applied, with the necessary modifications to those men who are serving with the Royal Air Forte, * X&apos;     DEMOST.LISATXPIT OF WOMEN !S CORPS.t The women will be formed into dispersal drafts anddispersed through dispersal hostels, the guiding factor In the priority given to them being that they will be dispersed as they can be spared, though it Is hoped to give priority to those having domestic ties, XX. EXPEDITIONARY FORCES IN OTHER THEATRKS OF WAR THAN FRANCE.Subject to shipping facilities the demobilisation of these forces will proceed, with but slight alteration, on the lines laid down for those serving at home or in France. XILOVERSlilAS COpiFGENlS.The demobilisation of these Contingonts will be carried out in accordance with tho express wishes of their own Governments and will be as expeditious as transport facilities allow.    The country and ports of demobilisation will be determined by the general transport situation. XIII. POST BBLLUM ARMY,Officers and men who are continuing in the post-bellum army will be sent home for furlough as and when they are required for service abroad In units which are proceeding to garrisons abroad in order to relieve the war garrisons which are to be demobilised.    Simultaneously with the return of individuals for demobilisation, the return of cadres of units for re-organization for foreign garrisons, for disbaudment, or for service at home, will be carried on.    The first to bo brought to the United Kingdom will be those detailed for forgign reliefs.
W. CO-ORDINATION CgjOTte.? A Committee loiom..as-the demobilisation of the ForcesCo-ordination Committee, and consisting of representatives of all the Departments concerned, &apos;  s for some time been at work,iV. RESETTOM7T CP CIVIL WAR WORKERS,This subject has been very carefully considered by aCommittee knotm as the Civil War Ttorkers&apos; Committee, whtohwas appointed with the following terms of reference&quot;To consider and report upon the arrangements which shfculd be made for the demobilisation of workers engaged during the war in national factories, controlled establishments and other - &apos;   fiftns engaged in the productions of munitions of war, and. on Government contracts, or in firms where substituted labour has been employed for the duration of the war,&quot;This Committee has presented five Reports, and proposals based upon the recommendations contained in these Reports are contained in G.7. 6047, Civil War Workers Resettle-ment, pages 2 and 3, Armistice arrangements, page3 5 and 6,It should be noted that the proposals contained In their fourth Report dealing with Armistice arrangements were made on the assumption that it was necessary to contemplate the possibility of a resumption of hostilities after an armistice, whereas the proposals contained in G,?. 6C47 assume that the possibility of a further outbreak of hostilities mpy be disregarded.Certain other questions arise in connection with the resettlement of civil war workers, and the following notes show the position when  G.T. 6047 was sent to the War Cabinet, WAR PLEDGES,A draft Bill on this subject was prepared at Dr. Addison&apos;s request by an Interdepartmental Conference presided over&apos;by Sir ^tophenson Kent,   Dr. Add16on requested  &apos;
this Conference to reconsider the draft Bill with a view to its simplification In view of the urgency of the position, and the revised draft Is now before the War Cabinet. WAGES AWARDS.The question of the continuance of awards made by the Committee 0I&quot; Production, etc,, has been referred to a Committee presided over by Sir- John Simon.    This Committee Is treating the question as one of great urgency and it is hoped that an Interim Report will be submitted during the week ending November 9th, EjCTEHSIOH OF WISHPLOYMEIIT nTSUR/^CH,This subject was dealt with by the Civil War Workex Committee in their second Interim Report which was referred to the Ministry of Labour.     It has been found that there are serious difficultiec in formulating any scheme of universal contributory unemployment insiu^ance, and in view of the urgency of the position alternative proposals were made In G,T. 6047 page 2, para.l. (i))   It is proposed that a statement of the Government intention to Introduce a general contributory scheme should be made. but the details of any such scheme will need further and possibly lengthy consideration.    In the meantime it has been decided to introduce an Emergency system .of free unemployment donation to cover a period of 6 months from the beginning of the armistice. APPRENTICESHIP.This problem as applied to v;ar workers present similar features to that of demobilised apprentices, and it I3 suggested that a Bill now being drafte: by the Ministry of labour should be framed to cover these cases. REPATRIATION OF COLONIAL .MD\ OTOIR MlfrTITION WORKERS.It Is suggested that, this subject should be
considered by the Civil Resettlement Co-ordination Committee, which will submit proposals and which is composed of repre-sentatives of the Departments concerned. XJC*     HOLIDAYS FOR MUNITION WORKERS.The proposal consider by the Civil War Workers Committee that a holiday with full wr.ges should be given to munition workers on their discharge has been found to be Impracticable and the proposal submitted in G.T. 6047, page 2 para 1 (h) are suggested as an alternative.
