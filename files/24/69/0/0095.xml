THIS document IS THE, PROPERTY OF HIS BHITAmnJtf S.E 0 RET,WAR   CABINET ,G.T. 6295. *PUBLIC: CELEBRATIONS IN LONDON. 6 0 memorandum^by.. Sir. CjF,N,. Kacready.The Secretary, War Cabinet.The Reports throughout the Metropolis indicate that everything was quiet last night and much more orderly than on the previous evening,     I visited myself the area between Whitehall, Leicester Square and Bond Street, between 10 p,m, and midnight, and though in some places the crowds were large they were orderly, and very little drunkenness was noticeable. There wan no interference with the guns placed in the Mall, but I am strongly of opinion that all gunn should be secured in some way., either by cables being passed through the wheels and strongly fastened at each end. or by some other moana, as in the event, especially during the General Election, of any rowdinesn these guns could be quickly used by the mob as barricades and would be a very serious clanger to the public, I have written to the War Office in this sense.     It is possible that on Saturday night there may he a recrudescence of rowdyism, but I am asking the Ministry of Munitions to hold a display of fireworks in Hyde Park, which they have been contemplating I understand for some days past for that evening, and this will, I think, draw off the majority of people to an open space where they can do little harm,The King had a most enthusiastic and loyal reception at the Alhambra and from the crowds outside on his arrival and departure.I will inform you should anything worthy of note occur during the next few dayr..(Signed) C.F.N. MACREADY.Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis.November 151h.,__1918.
