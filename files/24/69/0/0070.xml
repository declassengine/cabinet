S DOCUMENT 13 THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITAMC MAJESTY&apos; S GOYERIfcENT.)0 R E T.    i /*v j fj - j&quot; f   \f WAR   CABINET.I.-M70.       ISUGGESTIONS TO PREVENT THE SPREAD,_OPREVOLUTION/uRY IDEAS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM..y emorandum &quot;by in e&apos; Fx rat committee s aioner of Works, Etc,, pr ey i ous pap ef s - G.T.-619 5 and G. T. - 6259&quot;)Colonel Sir J. Norton Griffiths&apos; suggestions are good as far as they go, but from all I can learn from enquiries which I have made, they are quite insufficient.     There is, undoubtedly, in this country, as in all ethers, a certain fever of revolu-tionary Bolshevist ideas.     Bodies of workmen like tc call themselves Soviets, and talk of Bolshevism and revolution.   It must be remembered that a large number cf relatively young and highly paid workers has been created, who lack the restraining  , hand cf the cider married men - the more stable element in the factories.     A considerable amount of inflammable literature of a dangerous character has been and, I believe, still is being circulated by neutral and other agents.   A section of the Labour-press is certainly very violent.   The elder political parties have had no propaganda during the party truce and extremists have been allowed to have the field to themselves/ and, as is always the.case, they have won adherents.   A good deal of this might have been stopped by a more rigorous application of the Defence of the Realm Act.   If this weapon goes,, as it surely will, unless some of the provisions are extended,  a political possibility, which appears to be doubtful, the danger will grow rather than diminish.Agitation, without discontent, oan never be successful, To my mind, the question is to alloy as far as possible immedi-ately the large volume of discontent which undoubtedly exists among the lower classes,and even the middle classes.   I think the main causes of this discontent are,&apos; (l) high prioes, and more especially the high prices of food and particularly of meat, and the insufficient quantity ef the meat rations, not for health, but for comfort.   As to meat, I would like to emphasise the importance of rushing into this country as .cpeedily as possible feeding stuffs for cattle and pigs, so as to enable the home meat, supply to be increased tc its utmost capacity:   (2)   A lessening of the restrictions on fuel and lighting.   An improvement in this respect should be brought about as speedily as possible and people should, be given some indication when this improvement is likely to take place: (3)   The general feeling of discontent with the so-called profiteering.   There is no doubt that retailers have taken an enormous advantage wherever possible of the general position.&apos; and of the higher wages, that are being paid.   It is too often forgotten that whereas certain section of the workers have been very prosperous throughout the war, a very large number, and particularly those with
9 n c ?-;j ywith small fixeC salaries aLi the middle classes have suffered more than is generally realised.The more rapidly fighting men can he returnee to this country, the better, I think it will be for stability.   I regard these men as tho element best cal-culatad to keep selfish extremists and irresponsible youths .in tooir places.       The fighting man has no sympathy with t/. ose who struck work while lie was fighting, or those who enriched themselves during the period of his sufferings.     If generously treated, he would make an element of order and stability.Admirable as are the.schemes winch have been arranged for pooling the resources among the Allies, I cannot help throwing out a warning that after all wo are responsible in the first place for the welfare of our own people, and for the stability of this country.   If the people of this island were actually to go short while they know that food is being provided for,.say, the Gzecho-Slovaks snd other inhabitants of countries in which they have&apos;but a remote interest, and still more for our late enemies, a very dangerous spirit indeed may be generated here.-   Our people have been ready to make great sacrifices during tho war, and they will, no doubt, be also ready to make some sacrifices for the Allied cause after the war, but in a reduced form.     After all, the Allies stand to gain nothing if disorder wore to break out in this country.  :In general, rapid and courageous decision appear to mo to be a vital necessity and that the not. unnatural timidity and reluctance of Departments to run some risks should be overruled.(Signed)     ALFRED mond.H.M. Office of \yorks.12th November, 1918.
