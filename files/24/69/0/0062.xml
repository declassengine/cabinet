Q 7   b-tbl OUTPUT OF BSttRf&apos;/:E!ViORAMDUivt BY TUB FOOD CONTLOILSR1. I desire to drao the attention of the War Cabinet to the neeessity of arriving at an immediate decision as to the output of beer2*Under Y*&apos;ar Cabinet 362, Minute   9, it was decided to retain the present bulk barrelage of about 22,000,000 barrels per annum* and to produce the average gravity at which the statutory barrelage is browed &quot;to 10500 in Great Britain, and 10450 in Ireland.,3.   The question ftf increasing the prosont allowance of boor was considered by the Home    Affairs Committee on 25th September last and it was decided to adjafoa the   discussion in view of the uncertainty Jas to the available supplies of brewing materials.In view of the fact that barley is no longer to bo used in th^ manufacture of Government Regulation Flour, the brewing materials necessary to secure the output of beer at present are now assured.I5. Bearing in mind the undoubted increased demand   for beer on [demobilisation and the present industrial position the supply under present conditions is inadequate and I think it imperative to increase the maximum permitted Standard barrelage* while maintaining present restrictions as to gravity5.   The increase which I suggest will entail the   use during twolve nonths of an additional 11,600 tons of brewing sugar, and 414,000 luarteis of malt, and involves the importation of 80,000 tons of&apos;Ijereals for this purpose, or-    a corresponding quantity of cattle-feeding- stuffs.in the event of the increased quantity of barley being secured from   the home crop,      As an off set 30$ of the increased luantity of cereals used will be returned for cattle food in the :orm of maltsters&apos;and brewers&apos; offalsI propose further to control the prices of beer for sale in .all ports of licensed premises *I recommend that the statutory barrelago be increased by 20$ as Tom October 1st 1918^ vis.) from 10,700*000 to 12,840,000   Standard arrels, increasing tho total bulk barrelage from 22,279.000 to 6,050,000 barrels,
