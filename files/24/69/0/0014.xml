/THIS .DOCrrjGOT IS THE FROJOTTy OF HIS iRITAHNIC MAJESTY^ 30VERHMOT!)&apos; I 12T     ^Sj/i    :   &quot;        WAR     OABIHET0O1WRIBUTORI TOiPLCWCTT ItfSuMtfCE.(Memorandum by the Minister of Reconstruction)With many of the proposals set forth by the Minister of Labour in his Memorandum on Demobilisation and Employment (G.T.5150) I find myself in agreement,    Upon certain matters I will make my observations at a later stage *    In the meantime, however, I wish to refer to the question of the proposed extension of contributory unemployment insurance *(l)   Mr.Roberts says a   &quot;I propose .... that the scheme which has been approved by the Labour Resettlement Committee should bo proceeded with,&quot;    I am not at all clear from this whether Mr.Roberts is seeking the approval of the V/ar Cabinet to a scheme which it has not seen, or whether he desires the Uar Cabinet to approve the general principle of a scheme of universal contributory unemployment insurance.    If the latter is his intention I wish to support him,    If, however, he has in mind the former, 1 would point out that the question of a particular scheme raises deep differences of opinion and therefore I suggest that the V.rar Cabinet would be most unwise at this stage in committing i\self to any particular set of proposals *(2)   The Minister of Labour&apos;s Memorandum may be quoted in support of my contention?-&quot;It is no easy matter to formulate such a scheme and to secure^ for it the general acceptance among industrial organisations whioh Is essential if it is to have a chance of adoption, and
some time must elapse before I shall be in a position either to put before the Cabinet definite proposals for a universal contributory scheme, or to say that such a scheme is Impracticable,&quot;. (3)   In view of the foregoing I am somewhat at a loss as to the reason at this moment for an early introduction of proposals for extending insurance against unemployment. &quot;A scheme of universal contributory unemployment insurance&quot; says the Minister of labour &quot;has been worked out by the Labour Resettlement Committee, and if such a soheme is to be carried into effect it is essential that it should be laid before Parliament at the earliest possible moment.&quot;    This step it is urged should be taken &quot;simultaneously with the payment of the free out-of-work donation/&apos;    I regard this course as impracticable for the reason stated by Mr,Roberts himself in (2) above, viz;   it will take some time to gain the approval of the trade unions and employers&apos; associations to the proposals,(4)   The scheme adopted &apos;by the Labour Resettlement Committee does not 1 understand represent anything like a unanimous policy * I am informed that only 15 members of the Committee (y/hich consists of trade representatives apart from officials) . voted on the schema and that of this number only 9 voted for it, whilst 6 voted against it*    This argues a serious cleavage of opinion on the proposals in. the face of which aotion cannot well be taken.(5)   The draft proposals of the Ministry of Labour raise^ a large question of principle as to the lines on ?/hich any future scheme of Insurance should proceed, with which I do not propose to deal at this Jiraoture *-    Although I am
of opinion, that an immediate statement of the Government^ intention to introduce a general contributory scheme should be made, I donJt think that the War Cabinet should commit itself to any partioular set of proposals at this stage.CADDISOH.6th November 1918.
