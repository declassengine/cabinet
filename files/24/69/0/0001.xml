. FORTNIGHTLY REPORT ON PACIFISM AND REVOLUTIONARY ORGANISATIONS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM,   AND MORALE IN FRANCE AND ITALY.(Circulated by the Home Secretary) ----ocoOooo  I am appending this week a note upon Bolshevik activities in this country.During the past fortnight, Pacifism has been at its lowest ebb.   Though a few public meetings have been held, the attendance has been poor, and as one of my correspondents says, &quot;Nobody is bothering about the Pacifists now&quot;.   They themselves urge that as we have a reputation of being a sporting nation, we ought not to spoil our record by being vindictive.My Leeds correspondent describes a conversation he overheard in a public house in a working class district, where seventeen men were discussing the Peace question.   One said &quot;We oughtn&apos;t to finish until we have fought our way to Berlin&quot;; but the general sense of the rest was that they had no right, as non-oombatants, to express an opinion,    &quot;The soldiers ought to decide it them-selves.    Mind you. I agree with you. but let it come from the fighting man&quot;. The line taken by the Pacifists is that a vindictive policy towards Germanv will oause future wars, and that as the Germans have nor.- got a more democratic Government than England, we should only antagonize the German democracy by insisting on indemnities.The Lancashire men have no patience with this kind of argument.   Even those formerly for &apos;Peace by Negotiation1 freely admit that the recent victor-ies have changed their views.   They want the KaiEer deposed, and as England has always provided an asylum for Kings in exile, they are afraid that, the Government will be silly enough to allow the Kaiser to have a &quot;soft time&quot; in this country.    Fred Bramley, a declared revolutionary belonging to the Inde-pendent Labour Party, addressed a public meeting on Sunday, the 27th, at St. Martin&apos;s Hall in Liverpool, but though it was extensively advertised, only 150 persons turned up.   Bramley said that the capitalists frould have to be very careful how they behaved now that some five million men, used to handling the rifle, were returning to civil life.    These meetings are- generally attended by between 400. and 500 people.The Independent Labour Party professes to be anxious for a General Elec-tion, but individual pacifists are very much against it, believing that they would be beaten, and that the Labour Party*s funds would be depleted to no purpose.   The Lancashire women are more concerned with organizing for their new Parliamentary vote than with any question of Peace, and the Women&apos;s Peace Crusade realize that for the moment they are helpless.   The Independent Labour Party have deolared that President V.rilson&apos;s fourteen points conform entirely
with their position,My Glasgow correspondent says that the pacifists, v/ho were so g   Very noisy a few weeks ago, are practically dead, and from Coventry I hear that the prevailing feeling is that Germany must be &quot;knocked out&quot;.PACIFIST LITERATURE.The Workers1 International Industrial Union is distributing in workshops in Birmingham a translation of Liebkneoht&apos;s &quot;Militarism and Anti-Militarism&quot; *Sylvia Pankhurst&apos;s article in the &quot;Dreadnought&quot; of October 12th, on &quot;The Soviet Policy in the East&quot;, has been reprinted in pamphlet form.   In the same paper appears an article by Arthur Ransorae, on the Soviet Government, inviting readers to &quot;Look through the fog of libel surrounding the Bolsheviki&quot;.Lady Warwick has recently sent a cheque for  50 to Sylvia Pankhurot in support of the &quot;Dreadnought&quot;, with a promise of a further cheque within the next few months.The raids on Socialist offices is said to be causing mWn resent-ment, and Sylvia Pankhurst and Fairohild are determined to work up an agitation against what they call &quot;British Prussianism&quot;.   It will be remembered that a Roneo apparatus, used by Miss -Pankhurst for circulate-ing attacks upon the Allies for the intervention in Russia, was recent-ly seized by the Police.At the National Conference of the Amalgamated Association of Apprentices, held at Manchester on the 19th and 20th October, the Chairman, P. H, Kealey, made a very revolutionary speech.   He said that the day was not far distant when a Russian Revolution would come about in England, and he, for one, was prepared to go any length to bring , it about.   The speech was reported by a trustworthy informant, but no evidence was available on which proceedings could be founded.PROSECUTION.Miss Sylvia Pankhurst was fined  50, with costs, at Eckington (Derbyshire) Police Court, in respect of a seditious speech which she made at Whitwell on September 28th.THE RELEASE OP JOHN MEAN. ,The agitation for the release of John McLean (the Bolshevik Vice-Consul in Glasgow) lias subsided in Scotland, but has been taken up in London, where a Meeting was held in Finsbury Park on Sunday. November 3rd.    A &quot;John McLean Defence Committee&quot; has been formed at Sylviu Pankhurst&apos;s office, 4Q0, Old Ford Road, with Norah Smyth as Secretary, and G. A. Pargiter as Treasurer.    The workers generally appear to take little interest in the subjeot.BISCHARGEP SOLDIERS. , &apos; -A disquieting feature of the attitude of discharged soldiers is
reported from Sheffield.     &apos;The   Comrades of the Great War1.&apos; who have hitherto been singularly free from extravagances, are said now to have decided to join up with the Discharged Sailors&apos; and Soldiers&apos; Federation, under the Presidency of Mr, Hogge, M.P.    They are also inclining towards the Independent Labour Party for support, as they say that they must have some support to see that their pensions are net reduced, and that they are not thrown upon charity.FORECASTS BY WORKING MEM.The more intelligent workers are looking at the future with grave anxiety.   Many of them, and especially Shop Stewards, are strongly in favour of the Government keeping some kind of control over controlled factories after the War,   In Lancashire they are persuaded that the em-ployers are only waiting for a free hand to exploit the workers.    At Sheffield many men are enquiring whether they will be allowed to emigrate to France and Belgium, where work will be plentiful after the War.   They say that their landlords will raise their rent, factories will close dovrn, and thousands will be idle,    A well informed working man correspondent from Glasgow, who is really anxious about the future of the country, 3Ugge3tj; that British prisoners of war should be sent broadcast over the country immediately after they are released, to give their experiences of German treatment.     He adds, &quot;It would put Bolshevism out of existence for good&quot;.SPEECHES AND RESOLUTIONS.On October 26th, the Trades and Labour Council, of Sheffield, passed Resolutions against Allied intervention in Rursia and attempts being made to discredit the Russian Revolution, that all Imperialistic agreements and secret treaties should be immediately repudiated, and that the International should meet to set up a real League of Nations.    The speakers were Councillor Barton, Mr. M, C, Watkins, N.U.R., Mr. S, Williams, N.U.C., Mr. Byrne, of the Workers&apos; Union, Mr. T, 0&apos;Brien, Carpenters&apos; Union, and Mr, C. Gascoigne, of the General Labourer.&quot;&apos; Union, all well known Pacifists.Mr. Charles Duncan M.P. was very much heckled at the Marylebone Branch df the Amalgamated Society of Engineers on the 27th.   One of his audience called him a traitor and hypocrite, and the notorious W, F. Watson urged the audience to &quot;purge the movement of the Duncans and Barnes&apos;sn.    He was loudly applauded.   In fact, as Watson himself said a few days ago to une of my correspondents, the principal phenomenon in the Labour movement is rebellion against all constitutional authority, and the rebellion is falling first upon the men who have been elected by Labour to represent their interests.&quot;THE HERALD&quot;.In an article on October 26th, headed &quot;Ho Peace.   By order of the Northcliffe Press&quot;, Mr. Lansbury is good enough tc say, &quot;We have always desired, not bloody revolution, but ordered change and peaceful development. * Should Revolution come to this country, the b^Lame will lie at the door of those who wantonly and brutally prolong the War&quot;.    He is very angry at the publication of the alleged German-Bolshevik intrigues, which he declares to
be ex-parte statements, and not cvidenoe.    It 1b perhaps fair to him to say that there is at least a very grave doubt whether the dooumentp published in America were genuine.THE SEAMENfS UMIQN AMD MR, HENDERSON.As reported in the newspapers, Mr. Arthur Henderson and Monsieur Camille Huysmans were prevented by the Seamen&apos;b and Firemen&apos;8 Union from embarking at Southampton for Paris on the 35th,    The objection of the Union was more to Camille Huysmans than to Mr, Henderson him-self,    The action of the Union has made the Socialist labour men very angry, and they complain naively that the weapon of direct action was forged f*r use against employers, and not against members of their own class. &apos; It will take some time to heal the breach&apos;between Mr, Havelock Wilson and Mr, Henderson&apos;s Party,  Whatever may be said for or against Mr, Havelock Wilson&apos;s action, it cannot but create a salutary impression upon continental firebrands such as Huysraans.BOLSHEVISM AS A COVER FOR ESPIONAGE.The Germans have not been olow to take advantage .of the newspaper talk about impending Revolution in Germany.    Early in October, a German named Richard Klein appeared in the French Legation in Copenhagen &quot;with a story that he had escaped from Germany to evade punishment as a striker, and that Germany was on the eve of a Revolution.    Enquiry showed that he was in close touch with the German Legation, and that he had a bad record with the Danish Police.    Other individuals, calling themselves deserters and revolutionaries, are believed to have been employed by the German Secret Service, the object being, no doubt, to inaugurate a Press campaign in Germany, proving that strikers and revolutionaries are enemy agents.GENERAL.A good many people are asking why the Government cannot deal drastically with persons wh* are attempting to stir up internal strife in this country by revolutionary propaganda.    It is true that a Regulation under the Defence of the Realm Act might be paaoed, erapower-ing the Home Secretary to intern persons of any nationality who are a danger to the country, and if their teaching was gaining many adherents this might become a necessary course;   but at the moment it cannot be said that they are   gaining ground.   The real danger will be after the Y/ar, when the public mind is not occupied with Peace terms, and there are real grievances upon which they can work,    T$ intern them now would not do much good; to intern them after Peace is declared will be impossible.    For these reasons, I think that the present policy of prosecuting them when there is sufficient evidence, of selling print-ing materials when they are improperly used, and of continuing to enlighten public opinion on the subject of the real results of Bolshevism, as arplied in Russia, is the wiser course,DISARMING ON DEMOBILISATION.In view of the probability of demobilisation at an early date,
1 think it right to call attention to the danger of allowing soldiers coming home for demobilisation to bring with them arms and ammunition.   The disarm-ing should take place either before or at the time of embarkation for England. A large number of men have been bringing over live shells, etc, as souvenirs. It might be well to notify the public that all such souvenirs should be brought to the nearest Police Station for registration purposes; such as were &apos;live&apos; oould then be rendered innocuous and returned to the owners,MORALE IN FRANCE.The morale, both civil and military, throughout France continues to be at its highest level.   Even the real hardships of the high cost of living seem for the moment to be forgotten, and Pacifists have, as in England, been driven underground; nor are there any signs of enemy or defaitiste propaganda; Subscriptions to the French 7/ar Loan are coming in well in the south of France but in the North rather less freely, because many of the big firms are already taking steps for &apos; la reprise des affaires&apos;, and want to have funds readily available for reconstruction. ,   ,The dispute between the employers and workers of the metal industries at Havre continues unsettled, but there is no present danger of a strike.   In fact, it is hoped that the workers will accept an advanoe of 25$.The new Socialist majoritaires are organising propaganda meetings to popularize Internationalism.    Longuet is said to be.less popular with the workmen than his paper would lead us to believe.   The militant Syndicalists are asking for the release of Pericat and about sixty other Syndicalists, and are denouncing the clause in the Martial Law under which they were arrested. The excuse for these meetings is usually to discuss the Durand case.    The Malvy case, on the other hand, seems to be entirely forgotten, and it is now realized that the Socialist agitation for Malvy&apos;s rehabilitation was qu&apos;ite hollow.The relations of British troops with the Allies remain excellent, and the French are expressing great appreciation of both the British and the Belgian Armies.     The disaster to the 5th Army in March seems now to be quite forgotten.   The rumoured failure of American attacks in the Argonne and North of Verdun has had the effect of increasing the popularity of the British at the expense of the Americans,The only unsatisfactory feature to be reported at the moment is the ill-feeling between the Italians and the French, who express their extreme con-tempt for the Italians, while the latter do not conceal their dislike.   If there should be a strong defaitiste wave through North Italy, feeling in France would become acute, but   fortunately,   the march of events will give-little room for defaitisme.A lecture given two weeks ago in Marseilles by General Dolot on French influence in Syria and Mesopotamia is a little disquieting, for it showed that the Frenoh aspirations in Syria are perhaps deeper than we realize. Certainly the feeling of the commercial class in Marseilles is against the Zionist movement, which they regard as a German institution.
It has been suggested to the Ministry of Information in Paris that a wide publication of the German terms of Armistice to the French in 1871 might very profitably be undertaken.MORALE IN ITALY.The Allied victory on the Piave has come just in time to save Italy from a collapse, for the Milan Socialists had selected the first week in November for a general strike.   Every preparation seems to have been made for a second Oaporetto,   It is now clear that the extraordinary demonstrations in North Italy, and especially in Milan, when the German Armistice proposals were first reported, were a defaitiste Socialist plot.   The Arch-Priest of the Cathedral was induced to ring the bells in the middle of the night on the pretext that an air raid was imminent, and the whole city rushed out into the streets and believed the story that Peace had been made.    The first announcement had appeared that evening in the form of a telegram from Bale in the &quot;Sera&quot;, a Giolittian and Pacifist evening paper.   A soldier was actually arrested on October 17th, between Cremona and Mantua, in possession of a manifesto urging a   general strike.    At Ventimiglia, small typewritten notices In French have been seen in railway carriagesJ-&quot;Ne aousorivez pas a 1,&apos;emprupt vous prolongenez le guerre .De Giovanni, the Deputy for Vigevano, near Pavia, appears to be thechief German agent.Though the principal danger of a Becond Oaporetto is past, itseems very unlikely that Italian troops will be prepared to fight inany large number beyond the Italian Frontier,    It is believed thatthe Revolutionary Socialists will seize the first opportunity for arising, though it does not, of course, follow that the rising will be successful, for the peasants who hold their land on the metayer systemare apathetic, and there is still a considerable body of carabinieriwh* can be relied upon by the Government.    Nevertheless, it is notto be forgotten that the extreme Socialists are.in touch, throughSwitzerland, with the Bolsheviks in Russia, and that there is plenty of inflammable material to work upon.    An Italian deserter, formerlycondemned in Italy for High Treason, has just been sentenced by thelar geSwiss Authorities for having fifty/cases of arms, ammunition, and &apos;   Revolutionary leaflets printed in Italian concealed in a stable which he rented.It is reported that a number of Germans who were expelled from Naples are waiting on the Swiss Frontier for the declaration of Peace.
BOLSHEVISM III ENGLAND-An attempt to establish Soviets in England was first made at the Leeds Socialist Convention in June, 1917,     The firgt Committee consisted of the following persons.-W.C. Anderson, M.P.G.G. Ammon A member of the four leading -revolutionary and pacifist societies, who was endeavouring last Spring t-. get Russians of military age uut of the country.H. Alexander Treasurer to the British SocialistParty.     A man of independent means.Mrs. Despard The suffragette.E.O. Fairohild Secretary to the British SocialistParty.J. Pinoberg Litvinoff&apos;s secretary, now in Russia.F.W. JowettGeorge Lansbury Editor of the &quot;Herald&quot;.  -J, Ramsay Macdonald, M.P, Tom QuelchRobert Smillie Of the Miners&apos; Federation,Philip Snowden, M.P, Robert Williams,All of these are declared pacifists of revolutionary tendencies. Tom Quelch was appointed Secretary, with Offices at 4, Duke Street, Adelphi, at a weekly rental of 16/-.     The expanses of propaganda and rent were defrayed from subscriptions raised by the &quot;Herald&quot; and donations from various sources,&apos; but after four weeks occupation, the landlord gave Quelch notice to quit and he joined the Army.    From that tine they had no fixed offices,     Quelch was arrested as an absentee on the 12th September, 1917. This man was formerly editor of the &quot;Federationalist&quot;, and a member of the ., British Socialist Party.     He is also a &apos;soi-disant* conscientious objector, It is believed that the Hon. Bertrand Russell, D.B. Foster, Victor Fisher, Albert   Inkpin and Catherine Marshall ftere also interested in the movement, though they were not on the Committee.    The following Resolution wa3 placed in the hands of Mr. Ramsay Macdonald for use in the House of Commons:-&quot;This Conference, endorsing the Resolution of the Leeds Convention, hails the Russian Revolution, which has liberated the people of Russia &quot;for the great work of establishing their cwn political and eccnemic &quot;freedom on a firm foundation, and undertakes to work for an agreement &quot;between the International Democracy for the re-establishment of a gen-&quot;eral peace, which shall not tend towards either domination by or over &quot;any nation or the seizure of their national possessions or the violent &quot;usurpation of their territory - a peace without annexation or ^indemnities and based on the right of nations to decide their own &quot;affairs;.    Further and in agreement with the Leeds Convention this ^Conference oalls upon the Government to place itself in accord with ftthe democracy of Russia by proclaiming its determination to carry inte -&quot;^immediate effect a Charter of Liberty establishing complete political : -v. *and sooial rights for all men and women/
It was proposed tt hold another meeting at Leeds *n the 25th August, 1917, but thin was prohibited under the Defence of the Realm Regulations, By the 17th October, 1917, it was possible to report that the Workmen&apos;a and Soldiors&apos; Council Movement was moribund, though a little before that date the promoters had gone no far as t* divide England Into thirteen Soviet Districts,    Late in the Autumn^ however, there was some attempt in one of the Units quartered atSevenoaka to establish a Soldiers&apos; Council as a means if representing the views of the rank and file to their Commanding Officers,    The Movement fell very flat beoause the leisure which had made the agitation possible was cut short by the Unit being called upon to go overseas, whore they had other things to think about.    The-failure of tho movement at that time was due to the strong feeling among the working classes that the Russians, by concluding a separate peace, had lengthened the War and betrayed their Allies.When tho Bolsheviks came into power, they appointed TOhitoherine, then interned in Brixton Prison, tho &quot;Peopled Ambassador&apos;,    When he . returned to Russia he nominated Maxim Litvinoffralias Harrison, to succeed him.    On the 10th January, 1918* Litvinoff published an open letter to &apos;The Workers of Great Britain&apos; in &apos;The Call&apos; and a month later he published a manifesto in the *Woolwich Pioneer&apos;, saying that Peace depended upon the proletariats, and it could only be achieved by u nest vigorous revolutionary movement on their parts    On the 18th February, at the Central Hall, Westminster, he made a revolutionary speech, with the support of certain M.P,&apos;s suoh as Mr, JoBeph King and Mr, W.C, Anderson, He was then cautioned by the Foreign Office, to whom he appears to have given an undertaking not to engage in political propaganda.    He had taken offices at 82, Victoria Street, where he was visited by British and Colonial soldiers, mostly Russian Jews,    On tho 27th February the landlord who had a covenant In tho lease against the employment of the premises for propaganda work, locked the offices and refused Litvinoff permission to enjber,    He appealed to the Cturts for an injunction, without success^ whereupon, he removed, first to the offices of tho Russian Delegates Committee, and afterwards to his private house in Golders Green.    On the 10th February, 1918* a mutiny took place on four Russian Naval vessels lying at Liverpools and it was found that their delegates had recently visited L.itvinoff,    He had, in fact, first openly and then -secretly, taken every opportunity to stir Up civil disturbances in this country, and for-this purpuee he is known ts have supplied money to persons like Walton Newbold and members of tho British Socialist Party. . He was deported from this country on the 27th September, 1918, as an exchange for Mr, Lockhart, our representative in Moscow,On the 23rd February, 1918, two Russian Jews, Kameneff and Salkind, with a Russian courier named Savitzky, landed at Aberdeen with letters addressed to Litvinoff, a ohequefor  5,Q00 and  418 in cash, Kameneff was tlie Bolshevik Ambassador accredited to France, and Salkind wao intended for Switzerland,&quot;   The latter cwed his appointment to the fact that an American
whu had great influenoe with Trotsky, positively insisted upon his leaving Russia forthwith, and his appointment to Switzerland was a compromise. Among tho luggage brought by those poaple were a number of copies of revolutionary pamphlets in Russian, of the usual anti-bourgooin and pacifist typo, but there were alaa one or two pamphlets v/hioh attacked this country, and which had boon oompiled in Germany,,    As the Pronoh Government refused to allow Kameneff to land, or Salkind to pass through France to Switzerland, they wore required to re-embark for Russia via Norway, and the oheque and luggage were retained by tho Police until thoy re-^mbarked, which thoy did under protest,    Kameneff wan afterwards arrested by the White Guard in Finland and imprisoned for some months Salkind reached Switzerland through Germany,The violent proceedings of tho Bolsheviks in Russia were the most effective antidote to the poison that they had endeavoured to disseminate in this oountry, for in March Lansbury had already realised that revolution on the Russian lines would bo fatal to his hopes.    There was, however, good reason for believing that Litvinoff was [supplying money derived from Russia for Bolshevik propaganda,    Tho   Plebs   magazine was said to bo one of the publications used by Litvinoff for this purpose.     The movement for establishing the Soviet has nevor recovered, and it is most unlikely that anyone will have the hardihood to preach revolution on the Russian lines for some time to come.About tho middle of this year, the Press began to use the word fBolshevik&apos; as synonymous with advanced revolutionaries and pacifists, and a few extremists would boastfully adopt the term as applying to themselves. The tern was applicable enough, since tho word   fBolshevik&apos; is derived from &apos;Bolshe&apos;, tho Russian word for &apos;all&apos;, &quot;everything1, and tho Bolshevik is, therefore, an ttout and outer&quot;.    In a letter from one, Harold Qwyer, addressed to an airman at Eastchurch, occurs tho passage, &quot;Thore is a goodly number of Bolsheviks hare too; in four weeks we have had three strikes and - Innumerable mass meetings in the firnfs time,&quot;It has long beon known that the personages forming tho Committees, and supporters of pacifist and revolutionary organisations are interchangeable, If you take up the subscription lists of, say, the No-Conscription Fellovr-. ship, the British Socialist Party, the Women&apos;s Peace Crusade, etc., you find the same namos occurring in all of them.    W.F, Watson, who is mentioned bolov:, was one of the organisers of the Shop Stewards Strike in May, 1017.    Carmichael; who organised the Police Strike jjn London, is a conscientious objector and a pacifist.    He has been an advertised speaker for revolutionary socialist meetings.     Nearly all tho leaders of the British Socialist Party were personal friends of Litvinoff.     There is good reason for believing that Litvinoff assisted Fairchild with money secretly, shortly before he left.As an indication of the state of mind of some of the people v;ho are1&apos; members of the British Socialist Party, I may be allowed to quote extracts from a letter written by Lionel Britten, who was arrested as an absentee
on the 21st Ootober and who is believed to have been harboured by the British Socialist Party for some time.    Letters addressed to H. Humphries 27, Oamac Street, Calcutta, and a typewriter belonging to the Ftad Commission and a bicycle stolen from a man named Roberts wore found in his possession, and he is now committed for trial at the Central Criminal Oourt.&quot;Pear Harry ....... l&apos;m jolly glad to hear of your homecoming - ifyou call this blasted country home, ...... The question now is, whiohof ua can last out the longest, Germany, the British Empire, or L.B. 1 have had to follow some of their methods or X should have succumbed before this,    I have now definitely decided to beoome a thief,    I make sure of at least one meal a day free.    I rcb the railways as a mntter wf course, and when I feo into a shop for 3 pennyworth of some-thing, I try to oonre cut with half-a-crown&apos;s worth.    Its the only blessed earthly way one o&amp;n live.    These filthy stinking thieves, O.B.E.*s etc., have overrun the country.    Honesty is now a punishable offence.    Absolutely the only way to keep out of gaol is to thieve.I had an Onoto fountain pen which I last, so I went into the British Museum and stole another.    Mind you, I didn&apos;t like doing that beouase there is a certain flavour about the One .feels cne oanleave things about, but the war completely demoralises ycu.    You&apos;ve only got to thinkj this dirty filthy swine oan afford fountain pens, and for a dead certainty he thinks I ought tc be in the Army, I would&apos;nt hesitate to murder that man, if it were safe to do so.Op to now, I have committed no murders, but I donft know when I may begin.    There is an extraordinary effect of the cheapness of human life.    If I had bean willing to accept the blessing of the Church I should now be ankle deep in blood, but such a thing at the time would have revolted me.    Now I am beginning to see more clearly that it -really does&apos;nt matter.    I think when I can afford a microscope I shall seriously study the application of baoteriology to politics.1 stole quite a decent bicycle the other day, . It belonged to a lawyer and I thought it would get my own back fur that money the other lawyer stole from me in the days when I was honest, poor as I was, people saw fit to rob me However, there is one thing certainI am damned well honest enough to be a thief and not pretend I&apos;m anything elseLate in September, 1918, Miss Sylvia Pankhurst founded an organisation called &quot;The people.? Russian Information Bureau&quot;, with Watson as President, and a man named Hollowell as Secretary,    They struck off typewritten circulars to be issued to subscribers, with the object of stirring up agitation against Allied intervention in Russia, and they published in this way letters and documents hostile to the Allies, which were supposed to have reached Miss Pankhurst from Russia without the knowledge of the Censor.    Watson, speaking at Chandoa Hall on the 6th Ootober, said that London must beoome the Petrograd of England, and that the workers must unite and adopt the Russian principle of freedom.
An examination of the careers and speeches of the principal revolutionary agitators shows that they fall into four categoriesr-1, Declared sympathisers with&apos; Lenin and Litvinoff.2, Persons, such an Lansbury, with strong revolutionary leanings, whowould baok up any revolutionary movement. 3. Persons who are primarily pacifist, probably because they areconstitutionally opposed to any kind of Government. 4. Anarchists and Industrial Workers of the World.Thus we find anarchist lions, such as Watson, lying down with pacifist lambs, such as Roden Buxton, but all in agreement to create the maximum- of discontent with the minimum of danger to themselves.    There was, for example, a great agitation among them for defying the Regulation, which provided that pamphlets and leaflets dealing with the war and the making of peace must be submitted to the Press Bureau for censorship. Many ware for openly defying the Regulation, but after a successful prosecution or two, we find them writing to each other, suggesting caution and secrecy in the distribution of literature.There has quite,lately been a recrudescence of Bolshevik literature. Two pamphlets - the one &quot;To the Toiling Musses&quot; signed by Lenin and Trotsky, and the other, &quot;Lessons on the Russian Revolution&quot;/signed by Lenin, and printed for the British Socialist Party - have&apos; lately been distributed and a Belgian named Van Raendonck has just been sentenced to six months imprisonment for distributing the former leaflet among his vork-mates in one of the shops in Coventry.    The printer of this leaflet has not yet been identified, &apos;There has been a sporutic, but not very strongly supported movement for obtaining the release.of John McLean, who was sentenced to three years penal servitude at Edinburgh in npril, 1916, for seditious speeches delivered at Glasgow.    He was released in June, 1917, and in January, 1918, Litvinoff appointed him Bolshevik Consul for Glasgow; he has,-how** ever, again been imprisoned, sentenced to ponal servitude for a nev; offence.    He is a member of the British Socialist Party and the Socialist Labour Party,Miss Sylvia Pankhurst has just been fined  50 for a apeeoh she delivered at Crssswell in Derbyshire.A man named David Ramsay is spreading propaganda In Dartford and Erith in favour of the Bolsheviks.    Une 0f his latest sayings is that &quot;the day of peace will be the day of War &quot;.A good many people, with the instinct quite unfairly attributed to the ostrich, have been saying that no suoh things as Bolshevism exists in this country,    ^f they had declared that at the moment the movement is negligible, they would have been somewhat nearer the truth.,    tiut it is only negligible at the moment because the minds of the workers are so full of the tremendous events of the last few weeks amd the prospect of an
oarly peace-, that they have no room for anything else,   &quot;Those who have been watohing those revolutionary movements for some yoars have always noticed that whenever the country was in difficulties, as at the outbreak of war and in Maroh, 1918, the working man responded by throwing revolutionary talk overboard and stolidly backing the Government, and whenever things were going roally well, as in september and October, 1918, ho began to throw back his shoulders and increase his demands upon the beaten nn&amp;iy; but when the war appeared to be at a standstill, with occasional raids on either 3ide, the revolutionary agitators began to gain adherenco at onoe, even among those who are now advocating demands for an indemnity as part of the conditions of an Armistice,There is plenty of inflammable material about.     The Discharged Sailors&apos; and Soldiers&apos; Federation have already shown their active disoon-tent, and they are now likely to be joined by the Comrades of the Great War, who are said to ba inclining towards the Independent Labour Party for support.    Until wages in munition factories? rose to their present ra$e, the Independent Labour Party was certainly growing very fast, and as,soon as the pressure of the war is removed, with its consequent divisions between extreme Socialists - pacifists on the one side and patriots on. the other a the impulse towards a revolutionary ohange in our Social System ,will become more menacing than ever.Whenever the British working man really understands a question he can be relied upon to show good sense.     The difficulty is that he reads very little besides the cheap Sunday papers and the material which is circulated by revolutionary bodies, like the Independent Labour Party.
