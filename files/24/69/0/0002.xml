0146/850. S E C R E T    12PROCEEDINGS OF A MEETING BETWEEN REPRESENTATIVES OF THE NAVAL AND GENERAL STAFFS TO CONSIDER THE ARRANGEMENTS TO BE MADE FOR PLACING TROOPS IN . HOLLAND IN THE EVENT OP AN INFRINGEMENT OF DUTCH TERRITORY BY THE GERMANS. [Reference War Cabinet 486, Minute 8.)1.     The only troops available for operations in Holland would be those already in France.     It would be quickest to take divisions already out of the line and most suitably placed for marching or railinc to the port of embarkation selected by the Admiralty.     In the present circumstances this port would be Dunkirk, as Zeobruggo or Ostend are not yet sufficiently clear.:2.     The most suitable port for disembarkation in Holland would depend on the military situation at the time.If Flushing was selected the most practicable course would appear to be to ship the troops from Dunkirk.     It would hardly be a feasible operation in the present state of land coomunl-cation to move troops by land to Breskens with a view to trans-porting them by barge across the mouth of the Scheldt to Flushing, and in any case this would be slower than to move them by sea from Dunkirk.At the present moment although wo might be able to land at Flushing, it is probable that wo should be forstailed at the western end of South Beveland.Consequently the most suitable port appears to bo Rotterdam, the troops being moved there by sea from Dunkirk.3.     The probability is that the enemy will retire to the east of his present positions.     This will not materially affect the situation so long as he holds Antwerp.       It might be possible to embark a certain number of troops at Terneuzcn -en route for cither Flushing or Rotterdam, but the main movement would still be by Dunkirk to Rotterdam.     Once the enemy had . retired behind the Antwerp ** Brussels line, it would beno
no longer necossary to use sea transport, since fron Antwerp there is good railway communication to Rozondaal, giving access to the main Dutch railway syston, whilst further cast there is tho HerenthaIs - Turnhout - Tllburg line.   A still further rotironont to the line of the ifeuse would open tho whole of South Brabant to a &quot;direct advance fron Belgium. In such conditions our facilities for reinforcing tho Dutch would he superior to those enjoyed by the enemy for invading Holland, since tho main lines east and west cross the lie use, and the bridge-g.y which are in Dutch possession, would un-doubtedly bo destroyed*4*    Generally speaking the probabilities are that the Germans will not infringe Dutch neutrality unless, absolutely forced to do so, since it would eventually unoover the whole of their right flanke   They night be forced to do so if unable to retreat to the Mouee without traversing the &quot;Appendix&quot;, but as the consequences would, be so greatly to our advantage, we nay assunc they would do everything possible to avoid it.CONCLUSIONS *5o     (i) The Admiralty should consider the measures necessary to neve one Tivision followed by a second Division fron Dunkirk to Rotterdam(ii) The War Office should make such arrangements as nay be possible with the Dutch, with a view to facilitating co-operation between tho Dutch and Allied Armies in Holland *- (Sia) R.G.H.
