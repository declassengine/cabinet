CAB/aF^K    SOaRD OF AGRICULTURE AND fflS&amp;iftiaS. . Report for week onded 12th November, 1918a n n1 I 11Animals Division.3ttileRabies.    There have been 11 reports of suspected rabies and 2 of the &quot;arlior reports from Cornwall wore confirmed during tho week.    This brings the total number of outbreaks confirmed to 57, of which 50 were in Devon and 7 in Cornwall.    Tho position as to wire muzsles is not as satisfactory as it might be owing to the hesitancy of the Ministry of Munitions to grant to makers the Priority Certificates nocessary to obtain material for the manufacture of the muzzles.There have been 27 outbreaks of Swine Fever and 230 reports of suspected disease.    Out of 30 reported cases of Anthrax only    , 5 were confirmed by the Veterinary Officers.    Of Sheep Scab there were 8 outbreaks.Veterinary Department.Anti-swine fever serum.      During the week 6,700 c.c. were issued for distribution to keep up the stocks at the various centres.Anti-abortion vaccine.   20,150 cc (403 doses), have been manufactured, put up in a suitable form, and despatched for use on infected farms.Rabies.    Txx ing the week in question specimens were received from 8 suspected cases and are the subject of examination.The  usual work of the Department in regard to the veterinary examination of swine fever and anthrax material, as well as the making of post mortema in 4 cases of other suspected diseases went on as usual.Fisheries Division.Dredging at Osea Island.      The Admiralty are dredging a cut at Osea Island in the River Blackwater involving the removal of 15,000 to 20,000 cubic yards of shingle.    The original proposal was that this shingle should be dumped in the River.    In view of the risk involved by this procedure to the oyster grounds of the River Blackwater which are one of the most valuable sources of brood oysters, the Board made representations to the Admiralty as a result of which the shingle is now boing dumped at a selected spot in the 7/allot or further out to eea.    The question of saving somo of this shingle and utilising it in connection with developments which the Bovrd have in view is at present under consideration.Fish Food Committee.     Officers of the Committee attended a conference with the Brightlingeea Food Control Committee and the Divisional Food Commissioner on the subject of the recent Order controlling the sale of sprats and a satisfactory arrangement was made involving the suspension of part of the Order except in certain eventualities.    At the request of the Food Control Committee it has been arranged for an officer of the Committee to be stationed at Brishtlingsea during the season to assist in the marketing of $rats.A supply of boxes for immediate needs has been obtained and an order for 2,000 more boxes has been placed with the 1/Iaypole Dairy )] Company.Permits.     82 permits to fish have been issued and 213 aancelled.Fishermen and Naval Service.   All but two of the committee lhave now completed their work and the reports of most have &quot;been
received.   Call List XIX. was drafted last week but the Naval Authorities have agreed that the List should remain wholly in abeyance.Intelligence ,1)1 visionodommercia 1,m Control Branch.     The work of the Branch during the week has consisted of enquiring and correspondence as to the improve-merit of rural transport and extended commercial control after the war, approval of names for margarine and correspondence on matters arising in connection with the&quot; Sale of Pood and Drugs Acts and the Fertilisers and Feeding Stuffs Act.Large scale maps for the detailed determination of the route to be followed by the Biggleewade Agricultural Tramway have been forwarded to Colonel Chute *PublicationsJBranch.     The number of applications for ordinary issues of the leaflets was 422, in response &quot;to which 1,511 copies were despatched.     In addition 13,250 copies of the leaflets were despatched to applicants for supplies in bulk for distribution.The usual enquiries bearing directly and indirectly on *al publications have been received and dealt with by theagricultural public Branch.Flax Production Branch.     The form of contract with growers for next year is&quot; now being issued and preliminary notices have been published in the local press of the districts concerned.    A price of  16 per ton for the crop  .as harvested with the seed on is being offered.     Seed is to be provided free but all expenses of cultivation and harvesting borne by the grower.Deseeding is now in progress at all centres but alterations are still necessary to render the multiple deseeding rollers efficient, and temporary methods are being adopted to accelorate the output.Land Division.nail Holding Colonies.Heath Hill.     The weather during the week has hindered the corn drilling considerably.     14 acres of rye, 7 acres of wheat and 29 acres of winter oats have been drilled.    A commencement has been made with the pulling of mangolds.     Two small fields of &quot;Victor&quot; wheat have been threshed for the purpose of getting seed for the Colony.     The total amount threshed was 331- quarters giving a yield per acre of 41.2 bushels.Four bullocks went to market last Monday and realised  133. 18. 10.      Out of the original 50 bullocks, which oost at the farm  31. 5. 0. each, 30 have been S0i.d straight from the grass and! they have averaged  36. 1. 10. each.Holbcach.    Everyone on the Colony is busy lifting potatoes. There&quot;is nothing else of interest to report.Patrington.     The farming operations during the week consisted of drilling in wheat and ploughing in beans, also potato lifting.    The bad weather during the week made the land very wet and heavy to work. A number of soldiers and men all over the Colony have been suffering from influenza, which has prevented progress being made with threshing.
 L^lP-ifUaA&quot;     ^ may &quot;be interesting to note the large increase of I    work v/iiich has heen carried through this year in connection with the I  sale of land under the Glebe Lards Act, 1888*Under this Act, the Board have power to authorise an incumbent of a benefice to sell his glebe land, and a record of the transactions which have taken place this year affovde proof that incumbents are taking advantage of the situation to realise the capital value of their glebe land, and thus share in the present &quot;boom&quot; in agricultural land.The Board have made it a practice during the present national emergency to invest the purchase money received with the incumbent:s consent in National V/ar Bonds, on the ground that &quot;now&quot; money is thus provided for the prosecution of the war and a good rate of interest is secured for tho benefice.During the year ended December 31st, 1914, glebe land was sold to the value of approximately  100,000.     During the ten months ended 31st October, 1918, the Board approved the sale of land at a total price of over  435,000*The Official Fee3 received by the Board during the financial, year ended 31st March, 1914, were  351, while the fees received for the ton months 31st October, 1918, amounted to  1,502.Tithe. Convhold. Commons and Survey Branch^     The Board have been in communication with Queen Anne s Bounty with regard to the practice Of the Bounty Office of investing on the Corporate Account of the Governors all redemption moneys in respect of tithe rentchaxge received by the Bounty Office on behalf of Benefices, instead of investing the money separately for each Benefice.-The Bounty Office state that there is nothing to prevent the Governors petitioning the Crown for a new Rule under Boyal Sign Manual enabling the investment to be made at the specific risk of the livings It is a mere question as to which is the wiser policy both for the livings concerned and the church at large.    The Governors are at present allowing b% on moneys so coming to thorn, but they cannot guarantee this in perpetuity.     On the other hand it is not likely that they will have to reduce it for many years, if at all, on the moneys now coming to their hands.     If the livings have a specific investment made for them at their own risk they cannot expect to get b% in perpetuity.     Generally speaking, the advantages of investing on the Corporate Account, and not on the specific account of the l:ivSng. are that by having large sums to invest (for example, on big mortgages of landed property or in the purchase of ground rents) the Governors got a better return than could be obtained if small sums, such as are often received on their redemption of tithe rentcharge were invested in a specific investment for a living.     The Governors also take into consideration the question of the cost of administration of sums corning into their hands-   If large sums are dealt with by them and invested on Corporate Account they can got a margin of profit out of which they can pay the running expenses of these fundst     If they had to invest the sums at tho specific risk of the living, they would probably have to take some small percentage I    of each such investment for the cost of administering those funds.
If very large sums come into the hands of the Bounty Office on redemption under the Tithe Bill, when passed into &quot;law, tyueen Anne1s Bounty will again consider whether as to these particular sums the present system should be continued or a new Rule petitioned for.lham. Estate .Arrangement a have been made for 30 tons of sugar beet seed now at Archangel to be held in reserve without commitment for the ue cf th* Society.    Further analyses have bmwn made of each variety cf sugar beet grown for seed upon the Kelham Estate with satisfactory results, and lifting was started on Eridny the 3th inst.Certain wheat has recently been sold at 76/6 per qr. and (as a trial) a good sample of Potato-Oats has been sold at   &apos; 60/-,     and a further sample has been sold at 65/- per qr.Our initial venture with the growth of six acres of linseed has been most successful.    Although sown late on very rough turf land and harvested under difficulties with regard to weather, it has thrashed out well, and will yield over 2 qrs. to the acre.   The seed is an excellent sample.The live stock is all in good condition, with the exception of cases of foot-rot and ringworm which are causing some anxiety to the Estate Manager.    These, however, are receiving careful attention, although operations have been handicapped in view of the fact that a suitable shoisherd has not been obtained.Live Stock Branch.lii seel lane ous.MkAl ftUiMliLINftV wMftMcalvt9 applications were approved for export of 11 horses 1 application   was M       &quot;       &quot;    &quot;    5 cattle1 H &apos;: M        *        &quot;     &quot;    3 sheep1 &quot; &quot; * m     ,1    1 pig1 51 M tt        &quot;        &quot;     &quot;    5 poultryThe noi-raal work of Administration of the Live Stock and the Horse Breeding Schemes proceeded on usual lines.Statistical Eivisioto..*fcMV*wim   MM. HW**WMB&quot; ft&apos;tMHIHMtMMSt at      o^^Branc^.   The estimates of the production of orops of -Tnglandl^ are now complete, and were issued on the12th instant.The yield per acre of all the corn crops in England .pnd Wales this year is above the average, and with the single exception of the small area of beans, the total production is also greater; while all are better, whether judged by tho yield from an acre or by total production, than in 1917.    The yield of wheat is estimated at 33 bushels per acre (2 bushels above the average), and the total production, upon the greatly increased acreage, amounts to 10.534,000 quariers, which is the largest quantity harvested since estimates were first officially collected in 1335, and exceeds last year*s total by 3-Jr million quarters.     Special reports received from the Board5s Crop Reporters indicate that a certain proportion of the wheat has been damaged, especially in the northern districts and in Wales, but the condition of the bulk is satisfactory,    Barley has yielded 32^. bushels per acre, or half-a-bushel more than the average;   the total production of over 6 million quarters is the largest since 1914.     The production of oats is almost 2 million quarters more than the previous highest on record (1907), and amounts to 14,336,000 quarters;   the yi^ld of 41-  bushels per acre
is the best since 1910.    Mixed or dredge corn, distinguished for the titfet time, produced an additional 620,000 quarters from 139,000 acres. The damage to barley and oats has been considerably move serious and widespread than in the case of wheat *    Beans havo given 29^ &quot;bushels to the acre, while peas , with 27^ bushels, show the best return of the,, last ten years.    Talcing all the five corn crops together the gross production in England and Vales was no less than 8f million quarters, or quite 35 per cent., more than in 1917.The yield of seeds1 hay (clover, sainfoin and grasses under rotation) is practically equal to the average, viz. just 29 cwts. per acre;   hut that from the permanent grass (2li cwts) is   of a owt. below the average.    Owing to the increased production Sf corn, the total amount, viz., almost 2,100,000 tons of seeds and nearly 4,700,000 tons of meadow hay, is less than that taken last year, in spite of the bettor yield per acre.    The total production of hay of both kinds amounts to 6,785,000 tons, or fully three fourths of a million tons short of last year *s total, and nearly 1,100,000 tons less than the average from the much larger area of the ten years 1908-17.Estimates of the stockB of corn and hay remaining in farmers&apos; hands on the 1st November, are being received, and are in process of&apos; tabulation.I- Reports relating to 1st November are to the effect that potato lifting has been a good deal delayed by wet weather, but that good progress was being made at the end of the month.Fewer fat oattle were offered in the oattlc markets last week, as a result of the action of the Ministry of Food in acceptingIonly a certain number.     The fall in prico of store cattle was checked, but store pigs wore in very poor demands Agricultural \7agos Board0    The sixth number of the ?/ages Board Gazette, &quot;the publicTtTon of&quot;&quot;which had been delayed owing to a breakdown at the printers, appeared on the 8th November.    It contained a complete summary of minimum rates now in force for men, women, hoyB and girls.    Among other items may be specially noted a summary of the provisions of the Boards &quot;Benefits and Advantages&quot; Order in so far as it relates to cottages hold by agricultural workers from their employers.    A good deal of misapprehension still appears to exist in regard to this matter, which the Note should help to remove.Notice of Proposal to fix minimum rates for boys in Merioneth and Montgomery was gazetted on the 8th November.On the 7th November the &quot;Cottages&quot; Committee of the BoardIattended at the Ministry of Reconstruction as a Deputation from the Y/ages Board, in response to an invitation from the Committee of the Ministry on &quot;Increase of Rent&quot; Act, for the purpose of explaining to that Committee tho views of the Board with regard to having the rents of agricultural workers&apos; cottages eventually put on a basis of: economic rents.i ,
o) G wDuring the last week 82 cases of complaint of non-payment of the minimum rates were received.   42 cases of complaint were sent to the Inspectors for risit, 67 were dealt with in the first instance by. correspondence and 9 cases were complete.    Reports were received from inspectors in 17 cases.Board of Agriculture and Ministry of Pood Joint Committee.Questions received during the past week have been chiefly concerned with the new regulations of sale of the 1918   potato crop, and the conditions of sale of damaged grain.Arising out of conferences held in Lincoln and Huntingdon of our Representatives, it appears evident that in many districts potatoes are still in the ground and it is feared that a considerable loss of foodstuffs will result if immediate steps are not taken to ensure the securing of the crop.Considerable criticism is expressed as to the grading of potatoes by the Growers (Prices) Commission, the general feeling being that the quality of the potato is associated more with ;V.o type of land on which the potato is grown than with the variety; and that this fact has not been sufficiently expressed in the prices as fixed.The Joint Committee leaflets on the Parasitic Mange in Horses are still in great demand, and the Hants County Council have ordered 9,000 copies for use in a campaign they are conducting with a view to acquainting all horse owners in their county with tho Knowledge of prevention and treatment of the disease, in order to check and control any possible outbreak of the disease next spring.During the past week, the Deputy Director has net in conference the County and District representatives of Huntingdonshire and Lincolnshire.Ordnance Survey.MMIIWMMIMMMaMbDuring the week ending 12th November 1918, maps were despatched as follows:War Office 1,510Air Ministry 3,437 Admiralty 33,377Overseas 137,534Other Services    2,444*6 Hembers of the ^ 1S.A.A.C embarked during the *veek for duty at the Overseas Branch.Secretary4th November, 1918.
