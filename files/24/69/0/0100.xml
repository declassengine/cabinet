THIS^QCUASNT IS,. THE PROPERTY OF HIS BhITAMTC hlAJESTYir;^ GOVERNMENTS E CRE T. , ,. n10%?? WAR . CABINET.G.T. sm&amp;iIRELAND AND THE GENERAL ELECT I ON.1. Release of interned Candidates ..2. Circulation of Republican Literature.Copy of Joint Memorandum by the Lord Lieutenant and the Chief SecretaryWe desire to have decisions of the War Cabinet on twfc questions which eoem to us to be of suoh political importance as to require the guidanoo cf the War Cabinet before we como to a decision.They are :-(l) Should individuals who are internedunder the Defence of the Realm Regulations, . who happen to be candidates fcr election in any constituency in Ireland, be allowed, with or without undertakings, to return to Ireland fcr the purposes of the election contest.(2) During the General Election,, or anybye election, should literature of a frankly republican character be permitted to be published. .      ^. As to (l) we are agreed that in present circumstances it would be highly dangerous to allow the majority of the interned prisonero to be at large, in Ireland.     The time cannot le very far distant when the provisions of the Defence of the Realm Regulations will cease to be of force.     The danger of the activities, of the interned persons will unfortunately not terminate with the end of the war.     These interned persons are all of them workers in the cause of the constitution of an Irish Republic.     If they are released in order to take part in election contests they will seize the opportunity to lay their plans and make their preparations for,an active campaign, of force when the Defence of the Realm Regulations have ceased to have effect.We are satisfied that no undertakings which would le of any value would be given by the interned persons, or kept by them, if they were given.Our opinion, therefore, is that they should not be released for the purposes sif election contests.As tft (2) there will, undoubtedly, be a very great deal of republican literature published and disseminated during the General Electionj and the question of how to . deal with, that literature is the af s-^e difficulty. We appreciate that it would not be passible to prevent the publication sf a properly warded philosophical treatise adrocating the substitution af republican for a monarchial system if government,     We alo:. appreciate that it may not be possible to prevent any constituency choosing as a candidate and electin- a man wha frankly advocates the substitution of a republic for our present -
form of government.     But re are faced With the circumstances as they exist in Ireland,      &apos; Republicanism-will, undoubtedly, &quot;be preached.    Equally undoubtedly there Tvill be subtly interwoven into the republican teachings the advocacy of sedition and the use of physical force, and that is the danger v/e have to face,We think it is impossible to lay down any hard and fast policy, and -we suggest that it should be left t:i us to act as we think best in&quot;each case that may arise.(Signed)      FRENCH&quot; EDWARD SHORTT.15th November, 1918.
