SECRETYfARSHIP    BUILDING PROGRAMME.Note by..the first Lord covering AdiiiircJty Memorandum for tho War cabinet.The attached Meioor&amp;nduin embodies the result of the discussions &quot;which recently took place at Washington between the British Naval Mission find the United States Navy Department and the views of the Admiralty as to the steps which it is open to the War Cabinet to totee as a sequel to the decisions arrived at..The Memorandum was prepared before the recent improvement in the war situation had reached an advanced stage, but the V*ar Cabinet  will doubtless desire to have before them the details of the agree: rent made with the United States Navy Department, in case the present proposals for concluding an    Armistice should fail and.immediate action becomes necessary.(S d)&quot; &apos; ERIC GEDDES.8th November 1918.
8/// November 1918.WARSHIP BUILDING PROGRAMME.Admiralty Memorandum kor the War Cabinet,Referring to Admiralty Memorandum of 81st August 1918 (G.T, 5575) and War Cabinet 470a, the British Naval Mission to the United &quot;States discussed most fully, during the week October 7th-12th, with the United States Navy Department at Washington, the programme of assistance which it was desired the United States should provide, as set out in Appendix V. of G.T. 5575. As a result of these discussions, the following agreements were come to : Type.	Assistance desired.	Agreement come to.Destroyers	128, to be provided at the rate of Hi per month between 1st January 1919 and 31st August 1919 (8 months).	(a) That the provision by the United States of 94 Destroyers by the 31st August 1919 can .be looked to with certainty, and that not less than this number will be allocated by the United States to the Anglo-American Zone.   In view, however, of delays in the constructional yards which cannot be overcome, the supply of a greater number than 94 cannot be relied upon, although it will be made if possible. (U) That tho United States will, as a temporary measure and as soon as possible, allocate 34 &apos;&apos; Eagle&quot; type boats as a substitute for the deficiency on the 128 Destroyers. (ti) That although the United States are unable to supply by the 31st August 19.1.9, 128 Destroyers which it is agreed are essential for the Anglo-American Zone, they will use their best endeavours to supply the deficiency later in 1919, and accordingly, as the war situation develops, will continue to supply such additional Destroyers as may be agreed to be necessary.Minesweepers -	45, to be provided in 15 months at the rate of 3 per month from 1st January 1919 or earlier if possible.	(//) That 45 Minesweepers are necessary in 1919, but that owing to difficulties involved in constructing in the United States a new type of Minesweeper with whi :h the United States are not familiar, the   best alternative  is to substitute Minesweepers of the United States Trawler design. (b) That the United States will provide 45 Minesweepers as early as possible, it being anticipated that delivery of this number can be given between June and December 1919, the first instalment reaching Europe in July 1919.Trawlers (Patrol Gunboats).	i 5 per month until cessation of hostilities.	(ft) That the provision of 54 vessels of this type in 1919 is essential, but that owing to difficulties involved in constructing in the United States a new type of boat with which the United States are not familiar, the best alternative is to substitute 54 &quot; Eagle &quot; boats. (i) That the United States will provide 54 &quot; Eagle &quot; boats and will put them into the Anglo-American Zone in 1919, and as early as possible in that year.Minelayers	S	That, owing to the situation in the United States constructional yards, it is not possible for the United States to build the fast Minelayers desired by the British Admiralty and that the best alternative is to fit out 8 large Destroyers as Mine-layers, and that the United States will take these in hand as soon as the full  Destroyer programme (128) up to 31st August 1919 is completed if the demand for additional Minelayers still continues and will complete them as soon as possible.It will be seen from the above that the Mission has not been wholly successful in obtaining from the United States Government the assistance desired, but they are satisfied that the agreements come to fairly represent all that can be reasonably expected of the United States in the circumstances which obtain in that Country. The proposals put forward by the Mission received sympathetic consideration by Mr. Daniels and the Staff of the United States Navy Department.The most important respect in which the British requirements cannot be met by the United States is in the number of Destroyers to be provided by 31st August 1919, the deficiency being 34, and although the United States have undertaken to make up for this deficiency by the supply of 3-4 vessels of the &quot; Eagle &quot; type, it must be remembered that the efficiency of this type of ship is as yet unproved, and in any case they cannot be accepted as a satisfactory replacement of Destroyers.The naval situation may, therefore, be summarised as follows : An intensive renewal of the submarine effort on the enemy&apos;s part is in preparation which, when it materialises, will, it is anticipated, be far in advance of any previous effort.The United States will continue to be a naval liability on the Alliauce until the end of 1919; that is to say, her demands for transport protection will exceed the contribution she makes in light craft for escort purposes.Since April last our anti-submarine effort has been sacrificed in favour of the war on land, the British provision of light craft having been diverted from offensive to defensive purposes. v  (33)ASG(il9  Pk 3019  70   11/18   E&amp;S
The War Cabinet, therefore, has to consider whether it will: (a) Retain, in part or whole, the authorised building programme of Destroyers to tho detriment ofmerchant shipbuilding, thus sacrificing, correspondingly, the economy in Destroyers proposed by Appendix IV. of G.T. 557a to be effected in 1919 ; or(b) In accordance with War Cabinet 470a, reduce the obligations of the British Navy as regardsescorting American troops, thereby releasing British light craft for submarine hunting. This can bo effected either (i) by a reduction in the number of transports escorted ; or(ii) by a reduction in the distance from land at which tho vessels are escorted ; or(c) Act on the assumption that a military decision will bo reached in 1919, and accept, in thomeantime, a growing and formidable submarine menace which may, and probably will, have serious results in the latter half of that year.The Admiralty hold tho very strongest view that the submarine menace will probably not be controlled, and certainly will not be overcome, without the aid of the listening appliances which are now in an advanced state of development, and that the effective use of these appliances necessitates the employment of a strong force of Destroyers for hunting operations over and above those employed on escort duties.The War Cabinet are asked to decide at the earliest possible date which of the three alternatives mentioned above is to be adopted, but it is not proposed to ask them to express any opinion until the end of the year as to whether the completion of the two Battle Cruisers &quot; Rodney &quot; and &quot; Anson &quot; should bo proceeded with at the normal rate.(Signed)     ERIC GEDDES.8th November 1918.
