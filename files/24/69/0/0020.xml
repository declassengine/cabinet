-[This Document is the Property of his Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government]&apos;L     &amp; Printed for the War Cabinet.   November j 9 L8.SECRET.t^mm......mmm......w......LONDON  UNIVERSITY.Memorandum by Mr. U. A. L. Fisher.I AM in entire agreement with that part of Mr. Chamberlain&apos;s memorandum circulated as G.T.-5330, in which he points out that if such a scheme as I propose for London is to be adopted by the Government, they must &quot; simultaneously reconsider the niggardly support which they accord to other Universities, and treat them with a corresponding generosity.&quot; It seems to me clear that the Government will be compelled after the war to face a comprehensive revision of its grants in aid of * university studies all over the country.The main question, however, raised by Mr. Chamberlain is the great disproportion between the assistance proposed to be rendered to the University of London and that hitherto accorded to other English universities.   Upon this I would observe : 1. That the population of the area served by the University of London, its colleges and schools, amounts to about 10,000,000, not far short of one-third of the whole population of England. Provided that generous grants are made to the provincial universities to meet their own needs for legitimate development, they are not likely to complain seriously of the expenditure required to make London University worthy of the metropolis of the empire, even if, owing to London&apos;s special needs and difficulties, that expenditure is proportionately somewhat greater than the expenditure upon them-selves.2. That of the 160,000?. proposed as an additional grant to London, 80,000Z. is for reorganising five of the greatest London medical schools on the new basis, with full-time University professors of clinical subjects and their necessary assistant staff and equipment. The position of London as a centre of medical education is quite exceptional.* Not only has it a larger number of medical schools, students, and teachers than the rest of England and Wales put together, but it excels all other centres in the incomparable wealth of the clinical material concentrated in fche^G numerous hospitals, and in its position as the imperial capital to which students, undergraduate and post-graduate, resort from all over the world. After the war if the medical schools are satisfactorily reorganised, a large number of American and foreign students who previously went to Germany for their medical studies will be attracted to London.3. That at the present moment London University and its eighteen Allied institutions receive 112,144L of grant from the-State, while the seven universities and &apos; the eight university institutions in the provinces aided by the Government receive 147,3901 from the State.4. That one of the main reasons for the reform of London University is that any national scheme for increasing grants for University education all over the country* The number of University students (1913-14 figures) is London 	Full Time.

cannot exclude London, but that to give more money to an unreformed LoncCpn University will be wasteful. The modern provincial universities, so far as th*r general organisation is concerned, are free from the great difficulties which London has inherited from its past, and has now to get rid of, and their need is mainly for additional funds to spend along lines already laid down. London needs money not only to expand its existing work, i,e,, to start new chairs, to pay its existing teachers better, &amp;c, but also to set up an organisation which will enable the spending of that money to be properly guided and supervised an organisation approximating in efficiency to that which the homogeneous provincial universities already possess.In furnishing this estimate of the probable cost of carrying out the recornmen-dations of the Report upon London University Reform, I am not suggesting that the Government should commit itself to any definite or immediate figure. It is probable, for instance, that the sum which can usefully be spent in the next two or three years upon the establishment of clinical units in London would not represent an addition of more than 25,0O0Z. over and above the present medical grants, which amount to 23,000L At the present stage I am not asking the Government to commit itself to particulars of expenditure, but merely forgive its general concurrence to the scheme for a reformed and invigorated University.for London, which is set out in the report.H. A. L. FISHER.November 1, 1918. .o
