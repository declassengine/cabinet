The dispute of the surface workers in Wales continues.  There is no other dispute of importance.I. General Remarks.Features of the Week.The action of the Seamen&apos;s and Piremen&apos;s Union in preventing Mr. Arthur Henderson and M. Camille Huysmans from embarking for France has led to widespread expression of indignation. Although there is some conflict as to the precise reasons which, determined the Seamen&apos;s action, it would appear to be evident that, despite Mr. Havelock Wilson&apos;s description of Mr. J. H. Thomas&apos; protest as &quot; a first class joke,&quot; the matter is regarded by the trade union movement in an entirely different light. It has already engaged the attention of the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress, and though the result of their deliberation is not yet available, there is an impression which is perhaps not unjustified that drastic action will be recommended by the meeting of the Labour Party, which is fixed for the 14th instant.The matter cannot, however, be confined, to the domestic circle of Labour organisation and the point of view that any private individual who has obtained a passport and has paid his fare is entitled to protection of his right to travel is insistently urged in many responsible organs of the press. It was pointed out that this is not the first occasion in which this Union has elected to adopt these tactics. The public is reminded that the first successful venture of this sort was on the occasion when Mr. Ramsay Macdonald had been permitted by the Government to visit Russia soon after the Revolution as a representative of the Labour Movement of this country. It is also pointed out as remarkable that whereas strikes in other industries have frequently been met with firm action, no action of any kind has been taken against the Seamen&apos;s and&apos; Firemen&apos;s Union. From this the conclusion is(C1519) A
drawn in certain quarters that their action in preventing leaders who hold independent views from leaving this country for conference with Labour leaders elsewhere is not un-welcome to the Government.At the Albert Hall meeting on Sunday last, Mr. Thomas condemned the action of the Seamen&apos;s and Firemen&apos;s Union and received the cordial support of the crowded audience, as also did the threat that a continuance of such action might be met by a boycott on the part of the railway men, which would not only prevent persons of whom they did not approve travelling at all, but also, if necessary, prevent the transmission of newspapers and literature which they considered objectionable. Mr. Thomas pointed out that if carried on to any considerable extent it would inevitably lead to chaos.The Albert Hall Meeting.The meeting at the Albert Hall on Sunday last was a manifestation of the deterniination on the part of a considerable section of Labour that in so far as it can be prevented there shall be no sliding-scale peace. It is understood that the meeting was called by the Herald League and managed by the London District Council of the National Union of Railwaymen. It cannot be considered to have been representative of Labour generally. It was, however, attended on a scale which precludes the belief that the audience was in any way confined to members of the League or of the N.U.R.A Resolution was carried, which demanded an effective voice for organized Labour in peace negotiations, the acceptance of the fourteen points laid down by President Wilson as a basis for settlement, the trial of all those responsible for crimes committed against humanity and international law, and full reparation and compensation for injury to life and property on sea and land. There can be little doubt that in the ranks of Labour a suspicion is somewhat widespread that the demands which will be made at the peace conference table are liable to be proportioned to the measure of military success of the Allied armies. The matter was temperately put in Mr. Thomas&apos;s speech and is discussed with less self-restraint in the organs of the Labour press. They suspect.that the favourable military position will be used at the time of the conclusion of peace to the advantage of the capitalist classes, and the insistence of the acceptance of President Wilson&apos;s fourteen points is due to the recognition that such acceptance would preclude any peace conditions made simply in the interests of owners of capital.Not only in England but also in France there is a distinct symptom of rapprochement of the proletariat to the proletariat of Germany. The immoderate writing which is so common in certain organs of the daily press has unquestionably intensified this feeling  a fact with which it will be necessary to reckon if national unity is to be preserved to the end.II. Peess Comments. (k..)-Military.The Peace Negotiations.President Wilson&apos;s handling of the international situation seems to meet with almost universal approval from the Pacifist press. It is true that &quot; Forward &quot; describes the last note as being too much of the nature of a professorial lecture, but it adds that one has to remember that his audience included such recalcitrants as Mr. Lloyd George, M. Clemenceau and the &quot; Times,&quot; as well as Prince Max and Scheidemann, so that much must be forgiven him. The only really discordant note is uttered by the &quot; Call,&quot; which considers his terms as harsh and humiliating as possible.Emphasis is still being laid upon the Allies&apos; supposed dislike of the President^ fourteen points. Mr. Brailsford, in an article in the &quot; Herald,,&quot; shows that Mr. MacPherson dis-agrees on the subject of the freedom of the seas, Dr. Addison on the subject of raw materials, and Mr. Balfour on the question of the German colonies. The most, notable feature of the article is its discussion of the freedom of the seas.The &quot;Herald&quot; again expresses its dissatisfaction with the delay in granting an armistice, being itself fully convinced of the &quot; real democratisation of Germany.&quot; It thinks that we shall demand unconditional surrender, which will be a repudiation of democracy and the thing for which the German militarists are waiting and hoping. John Scurr, writing in the same journal, calls upon Labour to assert itself in order to compel the Allies to accept Wilson&apos;s basis of peace.
The threat of revolution in case peace is delayed is still the topic in one or two of the papers. The &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; criticizing the secret diplomacy that is now in progress on our side, refers to the possibility of a general insurrection coming upon us in the event of Entente Prussianism refusing the Presidents terms or demanding the humiliation of Germany.&quot; Justice &quot;enters a caveat against the holding of an international Socialist and labour conference at the time of the peace conference. Troelstra, who is expected to he the medium to obtain a nomination of enemy delegates, is the worst possible man for that purpose, and on our side Mr. Arthur Henderson is completely out of his element in inter-national affairs. So that a conference would merely result in revealing weaknesses and emphasising differences.*(B). Foreign Affairs.Russia.Both the &quot; Herald &quot; and the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; are of opinion that the Allied expedi-tions in Russia are mainly directed against the Bolshevik Government, and are likely to continue after the declaration of peace. Meanwhile revolution is spreading, and it may well prove that the real factor in the war has been, not the triumphant alliance, but the despised and rejected Russian Revolution.The &quot; Labour Leader &quot; refers to the abominable action of the British War Aims Committee in circulating at the public expense the forged documents which have recently been published in America. Mr. Ramsay Macdonald in &quot; Forward &quot; alleges that some of the documents are palpable forgeries, whose faked origin is known to everyone.The &quot; Call &quot; contains two articles laudatory of the Soviet Government. In an article entitled &quot; A Great Anniversary &quot; it claims for the Soviet Government a wide measure of industrial reorganization and the development of order out of chaos. It says that the Russia of disease and poverty will speedily become the land of health and plenty. The anniversary celebration is to include a monument to Socialism, a distribution of a million roubles to the children of the poor, and an amnesty for those imprisoned for counter-revo-revolutionary plots.(0).-Home Politics.The General Election.Mr. Ramsay Macdonald thinks that a &quot; humbug election &quot; is inevitable. The Socialist party, according to &quot; Forward,&quot; is not ready for it, being unduly crippled by the scarcity of paper, and the suppression of its press. The &quot; Co-operative News,&quot; on the other hand, demands a general election in view of the patched-up nature of the present coalition Government. There are several comments on the demise of Liberalism, whose adherents will now become either Imperialists or Socialists.War Pledges Bill.The failure to introduce the War Pledges Bill is disquieting to the &quot; Herald,&quot; and it thinks that the engineering and shipbuilding unions will place an embargo upon all sugges-tions for meeting the situation that will arise with peace, until the Bill has materialised.(D). Home Affairs.Political Prisoners.All the papers combine to agitate for the release of John McLean, who is stated to be on hunger strike since July. Most of them point out that the Germans have already released their political prisoners, including Karl Liebknecht, and consider it time that our Govern-ment released all conscientious objectors and political prisoners.The Seamen&apos;s Boycott.The &quot; Herald,&quot; dealing with the refusal of the Seamen&apos;sand Firemen&apos;s Union to convey Mr. Arthur Henderson and M. Huysmans to France, regards it as a case of a house divided against itself. The Union is a part of the Labour movement, and surely it should not use its power to defeat the objects of Labour in this war. The explanation suggested by the &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought &quot; is that Mr. Havelock Wilson and the seamen are backed by the Government. It attacks Mr. Henderson for his vacillation, and urges the formation of workers&apos; committees with a view to stimulating the rank and file movement.(C 1519) A 2
III. District Reports.London and South Eastern.The rank and file movement has recently been particularly active in this area. It has been decided to form a London District Council of Shop Stewards and Workers&apos; Committees, to cover and co-ordinate the movement in this area, including the public utility services. It is also reported that the E.T.U. has organised and will link up with this movement the switchboard attendants and station men, and that the East London ship repairers have organised a Workers&apos; Committee on which the office staffs also are represented, and which will be affiliated to the London District Council.A revival of unrest is reported in several of the London aircraft works. At Hendon, the large number of dismissals which have recently taken place at the Aircraft factories is stated to be arousing considerable discontent. At Grahame White&apos;s factory, the employ-ment of American soldiers is said to have led to a protest from discharged British soldiers.On October 27th the Enfield Branch of the National Federation of Discharged and Demobilised Sailors and Soldiers entered a protest against the employment of German prisoners to the detriment of the English workmen.West Midlands.The situation remains quiet in this area.,A meeting was held at Birmingham on October 27th, under the auspices of the Workers&apos; International Industrial Union (late I.W.G.B.) at which one of the speakers urged the workers to break away from their official organizations in order to join the above Union, whose object is to fight the capitalist after the war. It is reported that the meeting was well attended, and that several new members enrolled.Yorkshire and E. Midlands.Some disturbance is manifest in this district.In support of an agitation for higher wages several hundred auxiliary operatives in the Nottingham Lace trade came out on strike. They returned to work before the end of the week.A meeting of the Bradford aircraft workers was held on October 29th, in order to support a claim for the conditions demanded by the Aintree woodworkers. The men were, however, counselled to await the result of the Aintree strike before insisting upon the grant of those conditions.The Nottinghamshire miners are reported to be about to vote on the questions of the abolition of all piecework, and the continuation or modification of the contract system.Serious attempts are being made at Derby to strengthen the organization of Midland Railway clerks in view of the possible amalgamation of railwayfCompanies after the war, and consequent increase in their monopolistic powers.North Western.The strikes of the Aintree Aircraft workers and of the Cumberland Iron Ore Miners are at an end.It is reported from Manchester that the shop stewards anticipate with apprehension the withdrawal of Government control after the war, as they fear exploitation by the employers. They desire that some kind of moral control by the Government should continue. It is also reported that, in the opinion of the workers generally, much indus-trial trouble would be prevented if more publicity were given to the reason for arrange-ments, such as the embargo, which Government introduces in. the course of its regulation of industry.On October 30th it was announced at a meeting of all District Committees and Shop Stewards affiliated to the Mersey District Engineering and Shipbuilding Federation that the new constitution of this Federation had been approved and was already in operation. At the same meeting the secretary of the National Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades Federation said that, in his opinion, the Governments Reconstruction policy was too theoretical to succeed in practice.South Wales.The surface workers&apos; dispute is as yet unsettled. .Some members of the A.S.E. employed in the Port Talbot and Llanelly districts are agitating for a 47 hour week and increased overtime pay. In these demands they have not the support of their Union. Their refusal to work overtime is stated to be causing considerable loss of output.
IV.-Disputes.With the exception of the strike at the Aintree Aircraft Factory, which ended on November 4th, no serious strikes have occurred during the week, although a considerable number of isolated stoppages are reported.(a) Involving a Stoppage of Work.The Admiralty Labour Department reports seven fresh stoppages; in the majority of &apos; cases work was resumed within two or three days.On October 28th, 1,700 men at Grayson&apos;s Shipyard, Birkenhead, struck owing to the refusal of the manager to pay &quot; dirty money.&quot;  Work was resumed on November 1st.The Ministry of Munitions reports that 4,653 workers were idle and six strikes remained unsettled on October 30th.The strike which has been in progress at the National Aircraft Factory, Aintree, during the week, involved 1,500 woodworkers and 3,000 shipyard workers. A settlement has been arrived at and work was resumed on November 4th. The output bonus scheme is suspended, so far as the woodworkers in the district are concerned, pending immediate discussion with the National Woodworkers&apos; Aircraft Committee of certain general questions as to the introduction of systems of payment by results on the vote of an establishment, as against the vote of a district.A strike of discharged soldiers employed at the National Fuse Factory (Tipton) occurred on October 28th, the men demanding an increase in wages. Work was resumed unconditionally on the 30th.The strike at Messrs. McLaughlin &amp; Harvey (Belfast) reported last week has been settled. The men succeeded in enforcing a considerable reduction in the amount of female labour to be employed at the works.The Goal Controller reports 11 fresh stoppages for the week ending November 5th. In seven cases work has already been resumed.  None was of serious importance.   &apos;The War Office Contracts Department reports two fresh stoppages of minor importance.Reported from Other Sources.1,750 employees at Grayson&apos;s and a considerable number at Messrs. Cammell Laird&apos;s and Clover Clayton&apos;s shipyards, Birkenhead, are on strike owing to the non-payment of the customary time and a-half last Saturday.(6) Not Involving a Stoppage of Work.The Admiralty Labour Department reports no cases of importance.The Ministry of Munitions reports three cases.The iron ore unloaders at the Victoria Furnaces of the Ebbw Vale Company, handed in seven days&apos; notice to strike on October 28th, demanding an increase in wages.The trouble at the Lilac Mill Alliance Aircraft Factory (Oldham) reported last week still continues. Mr. Stavenhagen announces that the workers will strike unless their claims are conceded by-November 6th.The Coal Controller reports that the dispute regarding the alleged victimisation of William Hoare, and the threatened strike of the Firemen&apos;s and Overmen&apos;s Association in the Forest of Dean have both been settled according to the Controllers proposals.The British Miners&apos; Federation and the National Council of Surface Workers are now considering the Groverntnenfs offer on the question of the surace workers 8f hours&apos; day.Scotland.No unrest is reported from this district.The project for a Scottish National Council of Shop Stewards, which is being promoted by Gallacher, McManus and Tommy Clark, is said to be opposed by the A.S.E., on the ground that this Union is opposed to affiliation with Shop Stewards of unskilled trades. The scheme therefore seems likely to fail.
The War Office Contracts Department reports a dispute at Messrs. Cohen &amp; Wilkes, Manchester, owing to the employment by the firm of non-unionists. The United Garment Workers&apos; Union state that these non-unionists are offered higher wages than those paid to unionists, in order to induce them to remain outside the Union.The Committee on Production heard 44 cases in London and 14 in Glasgow during the past week. These included (1) an application by the Federation of Engineering and Ship-building Trades and the Joint Committee of Engineering Societies in the Liverpool district for a general increase in rates according to the agreement of April, 1917. (2) An application for an increase in the piece work rates paid in the Sheffield cutlery trade. (3) An application by the National Woodworkers&apos; Aircraft Committee for a general advance of 15s. a week in the wages of aircraft workers. (4) A claim from the Dundee jute and flax workers that women employed on men&apos;s jobs shall be paid at the same rates as men during the period of the war and demobilisation.The Chief Industrial Commissioner reports 173 new differences for the week ending November 2nd.G. H. ROBERTS.
