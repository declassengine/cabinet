FOOD PRODUCTION SCHEMES, IRELAND.

Memorandum prepared in compliance with Chief Secretary&apos;s Minute of 17th March, 1917.

Week ended 13th November, 1918.

The following is a brief statement on the work of the Department during the past week in furtherance of increased ? Production in Ireland :-

LOANS FOR AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENTS.

Twenty applications for loans for agricultural implements were received by the Department during the past week. The total value of machinery ordered from the beginning of the present year, to date, under the Scheme, amounts to Â£98,330.

COMPULSORY ? REGUALTIONS.

The Work of collecting rents from the ? land was set in ?  spring, is now almost completed, sterns are also being taken ? store possession of the lands to the occupiers when the Departments conacre tenant have removed their crops.

PROGRESS OF FAR? WORK.

Un?ettled weather during the week hammered farm operations. The lifting of the potate crop is now fairly well advanced, though owing to the soft condition of the ground it was impossible in many places to use diggers, the work in such cases being done by hand labour. There are reports of decay and sprouting in some districts where ? were dug and pitted a few weeks ago.

Threshing is proceeding steadily, all available threshing gets being still fully occupied. It is stated that in one county all the catmeal and wheat mills available are unable to cope with the quantities of grain which are being sent to them for grinding. Three now catmeal and flour mills are being erected in County Westmeath on the sites of old mills, and will be in working order by the end of the month.

From county Armagh it is reported that mangels weighted ? in that county during the week ? well over 30 tons to the acre. In general, however, the yeild is a ?appointing. Turnips continue to make good growth. The pulling and ? of the crop has commenced in Co. Kerry. The sowing of ? wheat was practically suspended during the week, but farmers are ready to sow when opportunity offers.

Farmers generally are placing orders for manures and are taking delivery where stocks are available. Basic Slag, it is stated, was never in such demand. As a result of the satisfactory results obtained this year from blast furnace flu? dust as a manure for flax

13/11/18
a merchant-in County Mayo has secured 50 tons in anticipation of an increased demand.

FLAX.

Harvesting.

Although most of the flax is now in stacks, much if it had to be secured in damp condition.  The consequence is that the scutching of the flax is being delayed, and the quality of the fibre that has been scutched is the poorer by reason of the flax having been scutched in damp condition. The yield of scutched flax, however, shows some improvement on the yields obtained in the beginning of the season.

Scutchers&apos; Disputes.

It appears that the action of some mill owners in paying higher wages than those fixed by the Scutchers&apos; Wages Award was in some measure due to the fact that they still continued to retain tow in contravention if the regulations made under the Scutch  Mills (Ireland) Order, 1918, and were making an extra profit thereby. The Department&apos;s Instructors and Inspectors have accordingly been instructed to warn millowners of the obligations regarding the disposal of tow, and to report cases of contravention. Millowners appear now to be adhering to the terms of the Award.

Seed Supplies for 1919.

Five thousand bags of seed from Russia of 1917 growth arrived in Belfast during October, and on being tested have been found to be of fair quality. The first consignment of Canadian seed arrived in Belfast last week and is of excellent quality.

Flaxseed (Ireland) Order, 1918.

The Staff of 38 Inspectors appointed for the purpose of seeing that growers reserved the required proportions of flax for seed purposes has been reduced. The services of 17 Inspectors and 3 Supervisors have been retained. Their duties at present consist mainly in preventing defaulters from getting their flax scutched without permits, and in seeing that mill owners comply with the regulations regarding the disposal of tow.

The number of growers who have been guilty of breaches of the Flaxseed (Ireland) Order, 1918, to date, is 380. Five scutchmill owners who have contravened the Order are being prosecuted.

MAINTENANCE OF LIVE STOCK.

During the period from the 5th to the 11th inst., inclusive, 250 applications for licences to slaughter or export heifers, 93 applications for licence to slaughter bulls or bullocks and 159 applications for licences to export milch cows were received.
