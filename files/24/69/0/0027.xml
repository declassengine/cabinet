Confidential. POLITICAL INTELLIGENCE DEPi^T^T(6 November, 1918. FOREIGN OFHCEGERMAN Y/O 20* ME MO HAND UK&apos; ONTHE PREDIQilvtENT Ol1 THE EMPEROR WILLIAM.The Question of the Emperor William&apos;sr. abdication is represented as being under discussion, and tbe official organ of the Governmental Socialists, tbe Vprwarts, announces that &quot;Sobeidemann (Socialist Secretary of State without port-folio) in agreement with tbe party, recommended the Chancellor to advise the Kaiser to retire&quot;.    Tbe same journal says:In given circumstances it can so happen that the Social Democrat leaders will retire from the Government......Their exit would, however, signify the collapse ofthe People1s Government and with it tbe collapse of the basis of the negotiations which have been begun oonoem-ing the armistioe and poaoe.^&apos;So far as the situation oan be disentangled from what is knownof the previous attitude of parties and classes towards theEmperor and from their present policy, it seems to be asfollows:1.      The Minority Socialists of all shades,from Haase to liebkneohtj demand the removal of the Kaiser sans phrase, and Would desire tho immediate proclamation of a Republic -Haase said at a meeting which he addressed at the Circus Schumann that what was wanted was the removal of the whole dynasty.    Placards with this demand are being posted in the streets of Berlin.There does not at present seem to be any prospect that this party, or rather, the various seotions of ultra-demooratic opinion which are reflected by its sections, will(1)   Quoted in the Times Haguo Telegram Nov.6, probably from tbe Vorwarts issue of the same day1.
get top upper hand in Germany.     It is even unlikely that they will ever get the upper hand unless indeed Schei&amp;emann and his friends were to lose all credit by sticking too long to Prlnco Max&apos;s Government, when Prince Eax is no longer able to conceal his real mission, the salvation of the German dynasties.26      the Majority Socialists represented by Scheidemann, are officially demanding the removal of the Kaiser.     They do not seem to say anything about the Hobenzollern or the other German dynasties.    Some of the more compromising among them have even indicated that they could work with Monarchy, just as some of them have scoffed at parliamentarism and have advocated the bureaucratio state, provided that the bureau-crats were Socialists. &apos;*This party will be guided by the trend of popular opinion and by the extent to which the spoilsmen of the Minority Socialists are able to influence it.     They will,4hov/ever, cling to the Government as long as possible, because by going into opposition they would virtually admit that the Minority Socialists bad from, the first been right.    This admission would undermine their own influence with the masses and might give the extreme elements the lead.A Conservative influence will be exerted by the Socialist Trade Unions,which desire no upheaval that would compromise the industrial and economic revival after the v/ar.3,      The Radicals (Progressives), represented by the Frankfurter Zeitung and the Berliner Tageblatt, are sons or grandsons of men v/bo were largely republican&apos;in 1848. . They have not ceased to protest against the abuses of Monarchy, as exemplified by the personal policy and the arbitrary interventions of the present Emperor.    But, under the
influence- -o&amp;. I^rooojwmio&apos; and. ^uliruran,, sua-cesses of&quot; the German ISmpire, they have compromised with Monarchy and with a great deal besides.    They would like to hold the menace of enforced abdication over the Kaisers head, in order to induce him to put himself entirely at the disposal of parliamentary Radi-callem- and to devote what influence he may Btill possess over the Army,4he Navy and the bureauoracy, to the Progressive oause.    Their own position requires all the support it can get from moderate monarchist sections of opinion, in order to buttress it against attack both from the Right and from the left.They have, moreover, acquired a certain pride in modern Germany upon the recent greatness of which their and classpersonal/proyeaty, economic, academic or literary, has been based.    They would resent the total humiliation of Germany of which the abdication of the Emperor would be one of the visible signs.Their attitude is betrayed in what might be called the &quot;LudendorffiM&quot; of the Frankfurter Zeitung.    A more bitter and violent attack upon a fallen idol has never been penned than the article &quot;ludendorffV which fills over five columns of that journal on October 30ih (First Morn.Edit.No. 301).    In a previous issue, a letter of Ludendorff addressed to Hintze as late as Sept. 19, 1918, is cuoted for the pur-pose of showing how Ludendorff meddled in matters of high policy.     In the course of that letter, which deals with the future frontiers to be imposed upon Poland and Lithuania, Ludendorff suggests the use of force in case the Lithuanian Popular Assembly resisted the German demarcation.      But the letter was manifestly written in reply to a request for an opinion and was an eminently confidential document.    There are other obviously unjust and exaggerated charges against
0 i61Ludondorff in the   article.Tho real object of this &quot;tremendous .4onunelationis to make Iudendorff a scapegoat to bear the indignationof the German people against the system of which the Kaiserwas the heart as well as. the symbol.     There is only onereference to the Kaiser in the.article.     It is as follows:Ho one was strong; enough to measure himself against . . him (ludendorff).   One alone could have stopped him, but he did not do it - the German Emperor......(The dots with which the scr.1te.rjc0 ends in an aposiopesisarc in the original).?&apos;he frankfurter 2eitun.fta.nd those whom it repre-sents will join in,the demand for the abdication of the Emperor if they come to the conclusion that there is no other way out.     And, at the moment,, they are being driven &apos;Un this direction by the Bolshevist revelations which the &quot;Yerw&amp;rts prints, end which they have to reproduce     There is during the present crisis freedom of the press;   and the Minority Socialist journals would in any case print those revelations.     Thus, on October 29, the I^cuil^fuiJ../r re-pro-duces from the Yor^&amp;rts extracts of the astounding letter of 400 lines in which in 1905 williani II. advised Niohcla-d to re-establish reverence for the autocracy by appearing on the balcony of his palace, surrounded by the &quot;clergy in full canonicals, with crosses, flags, incense and ikoms&quot;, and, addressing a mass of the people in the square below, the people being enclosed within a hollow square of troops &quot;with fixed bayonets and drawn sworiis&apos;5,     &quot;than&quot;? says William II, &quot;the whole people, deeply moved, will hail you with eiibha-4 siasin, will fall on their knees and worship you,&quot;Such are, or were, William 11*s ideas of abeo-lute monarchy, but he may have, as usual, had the arriere  , pensee of inducing the Te.1&apos; ? to do some thing which would make
14 (lit.9 9&apos;him appear to tho \?holo world as- the embodiment -of Asiatic autocracy end.., at the same time, display William II&apos;s own semi-autocracy as an institution representative, by comparison, of enlightenment and progress0In any case,, these revelations oi the Kaiser&apos;s past extravagances certainly cannot strengthen the position of his dynasty in the pre Boat crisis;   sn:d those who publish them have doubtless a largo store oi them u/on which to draw.With the parties which have always sir;; ported the Prussian Monarchy and with it the personal influence of the Imperial O/own, there is no necessity to deal here.The truth which throughout William II&apos;s reign ithas been the effort of ingenious persons, not only in Germanybut also in England and Franco to obscure, is the t tho Kaiserhimself is the man chiefly responsible for the course which german home and foreign policy have taken during the last 25years.     After he hrd dismissed Bismarck - a very necessarystep but one which was carried out with characteristic tact-lessness - he cast about for means of winning the support ofthe aggressive and chauvinistic elements of the Prussian andGerman peoples.     In a speech to the Brandenburg Diet shortly after Bismarck&apos;s departure., he cried:- &apos;&apos;]u&apos;en of Brandenburg,I will lead you towards great days.   Follow your Margravethrough thick and thin&quot;.     There was a whole series ofImperial speeches rnd manifestations in the same sense.At first William II, like Bismarckv had fought shy of thofaggressive movement for Colonial acquisitions end weItpol.itik. But he yielded to it as a moans of acquiring a perilous kind of popularity. . At the&apos;time of his accession the movement was discredited by the personality of adventurers like Karl Peters, whom Bismarck refused.to receive.     The writer very well remembers tho day in 1890 when tho Free Conservative Deputy in the Prussian landtag and the Aeic&apos;b3ta.;;:, Dr.- Otto
Arendt told him;     &quot;The Kaiser is on our side.   He demonstra-tively returned Peters&apos; salute today as he drove past in the Leipaigerstrasse&quot;.    Without the DiaperorTs support tho whole weltpoiitilc movement would have collapsed amid the hostility and the ridicule of the &quot;business classes and even of many of the old Prussian Conservatives.     It uecamo eminently the Kaiser&apos;s movement and the disaster to which it hed led is the disaster of his own fortunes , if not indeed of tho whole dynasty.
