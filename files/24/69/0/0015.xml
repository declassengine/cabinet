TP v&quot;]TMs Document is the Property-of His Britannic Majesty&apos;!, Government]CONFIDENTIAL. Political Intelligence Department,Foreign Office.november 2, 1918.S witzerland/001 .Cz/sMEMORANDUMonSWITZERLAND AS A BOLSHEVIK CENTRE.THE following memorandum, which has been communicated to the Political Intelligence Department, gives an account of the systematic Bolshevik propaganda in Switzerland during the war : I.The principal aim of the majority of the Russian Social Revolutionaries, such as the Plekhanov-Kropotkin group, which seemed to look forward to a constitutional Russia on the model of England or France, was for the most part limited to their own country. Opposed to this was what we may call the unlimited aim of the minority, the Lenin-Trotski group, which was to make the Russian Revolution a centre of contagion for the rest of Europe. The first group wished to overthrow Tsarism, the second to destroy the capitalist system everywhere. That during the war they have furthered this aim with German assistance, to German advantage, need not be questioned ; we can iind sufficient proofs of this (some of which in connection with Switzerland wilt be mentioned hereafter) without taking into account the somewhat doubtful evidence of the American Committee of Public Information. But it is equally clear that the ideal just mentioned, namely, of making Russia the first centre of revolutionary infection, has long been steadily held, and on the whole impartially pursued by the Lenin-Trotski section of the Russian Social-Democratic party. Trotski himself summed up the matter as long ago as 1907 in his book, &quot; Our Revolution &quot; (&quot; Nasha Revolutsia &quot;)*&apos; :-&quot; La Revolution de 1&apos;Est contamine, par 1&apos;idealisme revolutionnaire, le prole-tariat occidental et engendre en lui le desir de parler russe a ses ennemis.&quot;That is the first clear expression of the hope that a Russian revolution would give the impetus to an immediate revolt in all the other countries of Europe.It was with this hope and this aim that Lenin early decided upon making Switzerland his second field of operations. The reasons for his choice are clear: Switzerland was, in the first place, a safe asylum for him and his comrades during the Tsarist regime ; it was the home of internationalist causes ; above all, it was in the very centre of Europe, a convenient place from which to spread revolutionary propa-ganda into France, Italy, Germany, Austria-Hungary, the Balkans, Russia, even Great Britain and the United States. It was in Geneva that the Lenin group had their regular paper, the &quot; Sozialdemokrat,&quot; published in Russian, in which several of Lenin&apos;s most important utterances made their first appearance. A study of these in detail would show how consistent and regular has been his pursuit of his policy, both before the war and from its very first clays, tOn the 1st November, .1914, the Central Committee of the Lenin group published a manifesto! which was mainly an attempt to prove the imperialistic and capitalistic origin of the war and an attack on those Social Democrats who supported their respective Governments. The following concluding sentiments are worth quoting, as they form the keynote of most of Lenin&apos;s own subsequent utterances : &quot; The transformation of the present imperialistic war into civil warfare is the only true watchword for the proletariat, a watchword to which the experience of the Commune and the Basle Resolution of 1912 point us. It is the only watchword which emerges from all the circumstances of this imperialistic war between highly civilised nations.&quot;* Quoted in an article in &quot; Le Correspondant,&quot; April 25, 1918&apos;. &quot; La Portee universelle de la Revolution russe : Textes de Trotski et de Merejkovski,&quot; by Eugene Tavernier.f See &quot;La Faillite de 1&apos;Internationale,&quot; by Alexandre ZeVaes, Paris, 1917, p. 101. A. Zevaes is a Socialist recognised as an authority on the history of Social Democracy in France. He was associated with the foundation of second International.\ Given in &quot; Krieg&apos; und Revol ution,&quot; by Lenin and Trotski. Kommissionsverlag der Grutlibuchhandluug, Zurich, 1918, pp. 143-4.[367-50] B
&quot;However great the difficulties of such a transformation may appear at this or that moment, Socialists will never abandon their systematic and energetic preparations for it, now that war has become an actuality.....&quot;&quot;Long live the international union of the workers against the jingoism and patriotism of the bourgeoisie of all lands! Long live the International, liberated from opportunism ! &quot;Revolutionary Socialists must not shrink from the fact that their activities may cause the defeat of their respective countries : &quot; In no country must the opponents of the Government which is carrying on an imperialistic war recoil from the idea that revolutionary agitation may bring about the defeat of their country. The defeat of the army weakens the Govern-ment in office, helps forward the liberation of the nations oppressed by the ruling caste, and at the same time facilitates the war against the governing classes. For Russia this fact has a special significance. Russia&apos;s triumph leads to a strengthening of the world reaction, to a strengthening of Russian reaction, to the complete enslavement of the peoples in the already conquered districts. Therefore Russia&apos;s defeat is in any case the lesser evil.&quot;*Throughout 1915, in his paper, the &quot; Sozialdemokrat,&quot; Lenin continued this appeal for the overthrow of Russia as the first step towards the European mass revolution he was consistently working for.   He would also extend his agitation to France: &quot; What we now want is a campaign systematic, slow, earnest, obstinate a formative campaign, a campaign of illegal organisation and literature, of prepara-tion for the revolutionary movement of the masses against their Governments.&quot; It is not true that the French proletariat is not capable of systematic illegal action. It is false! The French soon learned to adapt themselves to trench life. They will prove equally capable of adapting themselves to the new conditions of illegal action and preparation for the revolutionary movement of the populace.&quot; I have faith in the revolutionary proletariat of France. I believe it will prove capable of forcing opposition to lead the way.&quot;jFor the leading German Socialists I^enm seems to have had a contempt which he does not fail to express on several occasions His attacks on Karl Kautsky, to him the type of German Marxist turned Opportunist, are particularly bitter: &quot;Kautsky, the great authority of the Second International, represents a typical phenomenon to be met with in every country. He shows how the recognition of Marxism in words has led to its transformation in reality into Struvism or Brentanism. The same holds good of Plekhanov. By public sophistry the revolutionary living soul of Marxism has been nullified. Everything in his works is admitted with the exception of his revolutionary battle tactics, with its dependent propaganda and the education of the masses in such tactics. Kautsky, with entire lack of principle, reconciles the fundamental ideas of social patriotism, the recognition of defence of the Fatherland in this war, with a diplomatic and ostensible concession to Marxian theories, a negative concession which does but emphasise the opposition of his party. Kautsky, who in 1909 published a complete work on the coming revolutionary epoch and its connection with the war! Kautsky, who in 1912 signed the Basle Manifesto on the subject of the exploitation of the coming war by the revolutionaries, now defends and extols social patriotism with all his might, and, like Plekhanov, takes his stand by the bourgeoisie, - and laughs at all thought of revolution, derides all steps in the direction of class war.&quot;with one exception the lines of argument followed by Trotski in his various articles and manifestoes written and published in Switzerland during the same period are in the main similar to those of Lenin. The exception is a broad one; with Lenin, revolutionary action (&quot; die revolutionare Tat&quot;) seems to have been the first concern; Trotski is more given to historical description and politico-philosophical programme-making. Thus his essay of eighty pages, &quot; Der Krieg mid die Internationale,&quot; published in Switzerland in November 1914,$ is largely an historical account, from-the internationalist point of view, of the origin of the war.

Apart from what isprincipally a difference of intellectual method, however, Trotskis main thesis remains the same as LenuVs : &quot;Kir from the war solving the labour question on an imperialistic basis, the contrary is true ; it puts before the capitalist world the alternatives interminable war or revolution.....&quot;Just as the war overthrew the Second International, so will its consequences overthrow the bourgeoisie of the whole world. We Social Democrats did not want war; on the other hand, we do not fear it.....&quot; The revolutionary epoch will create new organisations from the boundless resources of proletarian Socialism-^organisations which will be equal to the magnitude of the new tasks. We will set about this work immediately, amidst the mad roar of the guns, the crashing of cathedrals, and the patriotic howlings of the capitalist jackals, in the midst of this uproar we keep our minds clear, our eyes bright, and feel that we are the only creative force of the future. We are already numerous, more than may appear. To-morrow our numbers will have far exceeded to-day&apos;s figures. The day after to-morrow millions will flock to our standard those who, even now, seventy-six years after the appearance of the Communist manifesto, have nothing to lose but their chains.&quot;*II.The Lenin group had a fairly numerous following in Switzerland, consisting of Revolutionary Socialists of various nationalities. First there were the Russian refugees, of whom Lenin himself was one ; then there were the Young Internationalists, most of them hot-headed young Social Democrats of French and German origin, deserters or u refractaires &quot; who had escaped to Switzerland at the outbreak of war. Prominent in this second group were the French critic Henri Guilbeaux, who was to found and edit the revolutionary review &quot; Demain,&quot; with the assistance of funds supplied by the principal German propagandist agent in Switzerland, Schlesinger, correspondent of the &quot; Vossische Zeitung,&quot; as was definitely shown in the Swiss papers during October; Paul Golay, the French Internationalist, who was to edit the revolutionary paper &quot; Le Grutleen,&quot; afterwards to change this misleading name, since its policy was&apos; expressly the opposite of the national social reform Griitli party, to &quot;Le Droit du Peuple,&quot; also the defeatist cultural review &quot;L&apos;Aube,&quot; again German-subsidised; Munzenberg, editor of the revolutionary &quot; Jugend-lnternationale,&quot; which frequently published articles by Lenin, and a German deserter whose attempted expulsion by the Swiss authorities was to give rise to considerable disturbances later ; Herzog, a young German revolutionary who was to take a prominent part in several of the most serious disturbances in Zurich. The third and most numerous group of supporters of Lenin consisted of regular members of the Swiss Social Democratic party, led by Robert Grimm, leader of the Zimmerwald section and editor, for the ten years previous to October of the present year, of the &quot; Berner Tagwacht.&quot; Closely associated with him , personally, as well as with his paper, was Ernst Nobs, editor of the &quot;Zurcher Volksrecht,&quot; the second leading Social Democratic paper of German-speaking Switzerland. Other names in the Lenin-Trotski movement are Fritz Platten, secretary of the party, German in origin, naturalised as a Swiss, and, like Grimm, a deputy of the Nationalrat ; Karl Moor, one of the veterans of the movement, predecessor of Grimm in the editorship of the &quot; Berner Tagwacht &quot; ; Schneider, editor of the Basle Social Democratic organ &quot;Vorwarts&quot;; the Nationalrat Paul Graber, of Chaux-de-Fonds, in which industrial district he was to lead several disturbances ; Karl Graf, a metal-worker, one of the &quot; Jungburschen &quot; leaders and editor of one of their papers, the &quot; Forderung.&quot;These were the principal revolutionary agitators on whom Lenin could rely to propagate his ideas, first of all in Switzerland and thence, as far as was possible during the war, in all the surrounding countries. As far as Switzerland is concerned there is little evidence for the assertion that Bolshevism was solely a German invention having
as its only object the subversion of government in the Allied countries. Numerous defeatist or revolutionary papers of French-speaking Switzerland in particular were, indeed, beyond doubt maintained with the assistance o! German funds; the chief of them, the daily &quot; La Feuille,&quot; edited by the Swiss, Jean Debrit, was perhaps mainly a German-subsidised paper and, as has just been mentioned, a subvention for &quot; Demain,&quot; Guilbeaux&apos;s periodical, was certainly provided from German propaganda funds through the intervention of Schlesinger. In German-speaking Switzerland, above all in Zurich, revolutionary activities were supported by the Germans with the object of subverting Italian opinion ; this has just (October 1918) been conclusively proved by the findings of the and report-Engelmann trial, of which full accounts will be found in the &quot; Ziircher Post&quot; for the 10th and 11th October respectively. No one will deny that the Germans spent.a good deal of money on existing revolutionary organisations, and even imitated them independently with the object of hastening revolution in their enemies&apos; countries.It is equally clear, however, that the enemies of the Central Powers benefited from the Bolshevik propaganda. The constant agitation of &quot; Ziircher Volksrecht&quot; and other German-Swiss Social Democratic papers in favour of the Jugo-Slavs is a matter which should not be lost sight of in this connection ; the Berne and Zurich revolutionary Socialists were in constant communication with their Austrian, Serbian, and Hungarian comrades an explanation of the usually well-informed character of the &quot; Tagwacht&apos;s &quot; and &quot; Volksrechts &quot; articles on the subject nationalities of Austria-Hungary and the promotion of discontent and anarchical disturbance in the Empire owes a good deal, it is perfectly certain, to the encouragement and propaganda of the Leninite groups in Switzerland. The solvent of the Austro-ITungarian Monarchy has been national agitation powerfully supplemented by Bolshevik &quot;propaganda, much of it exported from Switzerland. All the evidence goes to show, then, that, in a word, the Leuin-Trotski revolutionaries were prepared to accept aid from both belligerent groups provided only that in so doing they were promoting their main object the European revolution by force and the overthrow of all national Governments.This class-war aim was definitely formulated in the resolutions of the First Zimmerwald Conference (5th-8th September, 1915), and again at the Kienthal Conference of the 24th-29th April, 1916, both of which Lenin attended as principal Russian representative.   At the end of 1916 Lenin drew up a programme of action for the guidance of his followers in Switzerland, thereby showing for the first time how thoroughly he intended to make that country and its own Socialist parties a weapon in his struggle for the commencement of the class-war against the bourgeoisie. A fairly complete summary of this extraordinary document, which was published in extenso by the revolutionary &quot;Nouvelle internationale,&quot; of Geneva, is given in the &quot; Journal de Geneve &quot; for the 6th, 8th. 9th, and 11th October respectively.   Its title is &quot; La Tache des Representants de la Gauche de Zimmerwald dans le Parti socialiste suisse.&quot;   Lenin&apos;s proposals may fairly be summed up in the formulae, &quot; Destruction of Swiss nationality, transformation of all strikes and labour disputes into excuses for revolutionary activity, undermining of the Swiss federal basis, anti-militarism, not in the sense of bourgeois pacifism, but in the refusal to use arms except against the capitalist class.&quot;    It is remarkable to see with what implicit obedience Lenins followers in Switzerland have attempted to carry out his instructions.   They have in the first place fought for the admission of foreigners to the privileges of Swiss nationality, and the unchallenged right of asylum of all foreign deserters, however great a menace these might be to the domestic peace of Switzerland and the mainten-ance of her strict neutrality. Thus the restrictions on the German deserter Munzenberg and the French refractaire Guilbeaux have been equally strongly protested against by the Swiss revolutionary Socialists.   The second point of the programme has received striking illustration in the numerous strikes which have troubled Swiss economic life during the past two years.   On every occasion of an important strike certain of Lenins followers have sought to rob it of its economic character and give it a. general revolutionary character.   The most recent and instructive example was the bank employees&apos; strike at Zurich on the 30th September, 1918.   Their demands, ,for increase of pay and recognition of their union, were fairly quickly conceded and accepted by the leaders.   Lenin&apos;s alter ego, Fritz Platten, however, did his best to transform the strike into a display of revolutionary force.   The notices of the termination of the strike were prevented from being distributed by the intervention of Pla^ten&apos;s followers and with the help of the tramway men, who acted throughout like a drilled revolutionary force (&quot; Journal de Geneve,&quot; the 5th and 6th October), the strike was prolonged an almost literal carrying out of the instructions Lenin left* See &quot;New Europe&quot; for October 24, 1918, where the main proposals are given.
5^9behind him. The point about undermining the Swiss Federal basis is expressed in a section of the instructions advocating Socialist agitation in Switzerland for a direct federal tax on incomes, a stroke at the very principle of cantonal government. The, call for this duly came in the first months of 1918, and in June the Socialists, assisted by some of the bourgeois politicians of German-speaking Switzerland, succeeded in bringing about a popular initiative in favour of their proposal. It was defeated by about 50,000 votes (the approximate figures were 323,000 against 274,000), but the majority against was lower than was hoped for by the opponents of the measure, and but for the efforts of French-speaking Swiss electors it would have been carried. The last clause needs no illustration. Hardly a week goes by without some kind of anti-militarist agitation, frequently due to the long and burdensome mobilisation of the Swiss army, but nearly always, sooner or later, taken up and exploited by the &quot; Jungburschen,&quot; who, it must be emphasised, are not, in accordance with Lenin&apos;s instructions, averse from bearing arms it is their duty to learn the business of warfare-but only from employing them in national defence should they be called upon to do so.In this programme-document, as well as Lenin&apos;s farewell letter to the Swiss workers,* Lenin showed quite clearly that he did not rely on what he called the &quot; Centre,&quot; Grimm in Switzerland, Haase and Kautsky in Germany, Longuet in France, and Snowden and Ramsay jiacdonald in Great Britain, any more thanbn the ordinary &quot; Sozialpatrioten.&quot; His hope was in the young revolutionaries, who grouped them-selves round the proletarian papers, &quot;Die Forderung,&quot; the &quot; Jugend-Internationale,&quot; and &quot; Freie Jugend.&quot;j It is to these that, in the farewell letter just referred to, Lenin addressed his views on the tasks of the Russian Revolution, to which lie is about to take his way : &quot; Before our departure we wish, as far as can be done in a short farewell letter, to state our views on the task of the Russian Revolution. We feel all the more bound to do this since it is through the mediation of the Swiss workers, who have been protected from the war and enjoy relatively the greatest amount of liberty, also, thanks to their country&apos;s variety of languages, that we have been enabled to address ourselves to the German, French, and Italian workers.&quot;Only the revolutionary proletariat of Russia and Europe which has remained true to the revolutionary flag can set humanity free from the horrors of the imperialist war.&quot; We are not pacifists. We are the opponents of imperialistic wars which are conducted by capitalists on account of their share in the imperialistic booty.&quot; We declare it absurd to suppose that the revolutionary proletariat will renounce revolutionary wars, which appear to be necessary in the interest of Socialism.&quot; The Russian proletariat is not in a position alone to accomplish the Socialist Revolution. But it can give the present Russian Revolution an impetus which would bring about the best conditions for such a revolution, and, in a sense, be its beginning. It can make easier the conditions under which its principal and most faithful ally, the European and American proletariat, would enter upon the decisive struggle.&quot; The future of German Socialism is represented not by the traitors Scheidemann, Legien, David, and Co., nor by the vacillating, characterless $figures of Haase, Kautsky, and Co., held fast in the routine of the times of peace. The future of German Socialism belongs to that tendency which produced Karl Liebknecbt, formed the &apos; Spartacus&apos; group and found its expression in the Bremen &quot;Workers&apos;policy.&apos;&quot; The German proletariat is the most faithful and confident ally of the Russian and international revolution,&quot; The transformation of the imperialist war into a civil war begins to be a fact.   Long live the commencing proletarian revolution in Europe !&quot;III.Such were Lenin&apos;s last words to the Swiss revolutionaries. At the end of April he left for Russia. Fritz Platten, who also went through Germany to Petrograd, made a statement in the &quot; Berner Tagwacht&quot; for the 23rd April to the effect that he* &quot; Krieg und Revolution,&quot; pp. 153-159.\ All three papers were suppressed by the Swiss Federal authorities in February 1918, but there is good leason for supposing that they were revived either under another name or secretly.[367-50],      * C
was aware that the Germans were letting him and his comrades pass in the hope that they would cause disturbances in Russia useful to the Central Powers, but that he, for his part, was going in the hope of being able to assist a general revolution.In the following August came the Hoffmann-Grimm affair. From conversations the writer has had with one or two representative German-Swiss Social Democrats it can be truthfully stated that Grimm&apos;s action, the German-inspired character of which there is little reason to doubt, in spite of the findings of the Committee of Enquiry, dealt his reputation a blow from which it has never recovered among the extreme rank-and-file Swiss Socialists. Lenin, as we have seen, considered Grimm a weakling; the Leninites in Switzerland at present not only echo this opinion, but extend it on occasions to men even more to- the Left, such as Nobs and Platten. The two last named, for example, were denounced by the &quot; Jungbursche&quot; Herzog during the Zurich strike of the 9th October, 1918, as &quot; Sesselpolitiker.&quot; As a leaflet circulated widely in Switzerland at the beginning of the present year expressed it in effect, Nobs stood for the general strike, Karl Graf (another of the faithful pro-Lenin &quot; Juugburschen &quot;) for revolution. Since there is every reason to believe that at least Platten remains in the confidence of the Moscowr Bolshevik Government, the truth of the matter would seem to be that by the &quot; Jungburschen &quot; it is hoped to keep the older and more responsible Swiss Social Democrats, Grimm and Platten, both Nationalrate, screwed up to the requisite pitch of revolutionary fervour, lest some bureaucratic ambition or sense of duty to their Government may lure them from their task of promoting the class-war in their country and all surrounding countries.The effect on Swiss Socialist opinion of the Bolshevik coup dJetat of October 1917 was not very marked, though rather serious riots at Zurich on the 15th, 16th, and 17th November, 1917, in which another German - deserter named Rotten was concerned, may have been due to the force of example. On the whole, however, even the Zimmerwalders were inclined to take the matter calmly and defer action until it should be made possible for the flames of revolution, beginning in Germany,^ to break out. In January an attempt was made by the Internationalist Socialist theological professor Ragaz, in a telegram to Lenin, to persuade him not to agree to a separate peace. This occasioned a good deal of criticism from certain pacifists, but events speedily caused the incident to be forgotten. In February there arrived the first Bolshevik delegate to Switzerland since the Bolshevik revolution, Comrade Holzmann, who was given a good press in the familiar group of Zimmerwald papers, &quot; Berner Tagwacht,&quot; &quot;Ziircher Volksrecht,&quot; &quot;La Sentinelle,&quot; also in the defeatist &quot;La Feuille &quot; and the Italian Social Democratic paper of Zurich, &quot;L&apos;Avvenire del Lavoratore.&quot; Certain meetings arranged for him were forbidden by the Swiss police authorities, but, apart from a demonstration of protest by the Geneva Socialists, no action was taken, and liolzmann soon retired from public notice. A much more ambitious Bolshevik delegation arrived in Switzerland towards the end of May. It was headed by the Lettish Bolshevik, Jean Berzine, who had with him twelve other comrades, all the personnel for a regular legation. He was received by M. Calonder. the. President of the Swiss Confederation, to whom he is understood to have given an undertaking that he would not carry on Bolshevik propaganda. But he shortly afterwards gave interviews to the Berner Tagwacht&quot; (28th and 30th May) and the &quot; Ziircher Volksrecht&quot; (29th and 31st May) which were propagandist in effect, and a little later took the more decided steps, first, of placing in the principal Swiss papers a notice to the effect that all Russians should make application for passports, &amp;c, to him,&apos; and, secondly, of attempting to obtain control of the former Russian Legation, which, however, was protected by the Swiss police.At the same time reports were received of the placing to the Bolshevik account of large sums of money in the Swiss banks. This was obviously the first step in the systematic organisation of a propaganda campaign. The second, reported in the &quot; Gazette de Lausanne&quot; for the 9th June, 1918, quickly followed, the despatch by Lenin of a propagandist agent named Lipnit,sky to Berne with the object of opening a bureau there. About the middle of June the bureau was opened and a flood of Bolshevik propagandist messages soon made their presence felt in the Swiss press. They were generally distinguished by the letters &quot; r.n.&quot; (&quot;Russian Nachrichten&quot;), and for several weeks, until more important events began to crowd them out, were frequently to be found not only in the Social Democratic papers, which, according to a careful observer, were bribed to take them, but also in the bourgeois press, to which, after the regular Swiss telegraphic agency, the Societe telegraphique suisse, had refused to distribute them, they were, offered gratis, entailing at the lowest estimate an* &quot;Berner Tagwacht&quot; November 10, 1917.
expenditure of about 1001. a week. In the&quot;maiii the &quot; r.n,&quot; telegrams followed the lines of the Russian wireless service, and were presumably cabled from Stockholm. To anyone who has regularly studied the Bolshevik wireless messages the harm they were capable of doing in the Swiss press, not only to the Entente cause, but to ordered government in general, must he obvious.And side by side with the Bolshevik press propaganda a propagandist publishing house, called the &quot; Promachos-Verlag,&quot; was established at Berne. This has produced well-printed books, leaflets, and pamphlets, such as Trotski&apos;s &quot; Von der Oktober Revolution bis zum Brester Friedens-Vertrag,&quot; two or three of Lenin&apos;s appeals to the working classes one to the American workers was being so widely circulated in Switzerland during September last that the British propaganda service was compelled to produce a counterblast; certain copies distributed in this country would seem to have reached England from Switzerland by some evasion of the censorship. The two latest achievements of the publishing house, most of whose work seems to be under Plattens control, are the issue in pamphlet form of the Swiss Minister Odier&apos;s protest against the Bolshevik regime, together with Chicherin&apos;s reply, and a booklet, in English, by Mr. Phillips Price, formerly Petrograd correspondent of the &quot;Manchester Guardian,&quot; entitled &quot;The Truth about the Intervention of the Allies in Russia.&quot; Finally, there is produced, also under Plattens direction, a regular news-sheet called the &quot; Sozialistische Korrespondenz,&quot; copies of which are periodically intercepted by the British censorship on their way to certain pro-Bolshevik Socialists in this country. Lenin and his agents appear to know the people on whom they can rely in Great Britain, and in this connection attention ought to he called to his favourable reference, in his speech reported in &quot; Izvestiya &quot; for the 24th July last, to the East Endpaper the &quot; Dreadnought.&quot; produced under the editorship of Miss Sylvia Pankhurst. It is safe to assume, and there are in fact signs it is impossible to mistake, that what has been so systematically planned in Switzerland, will be attempted in Great Britain, Germany, France, Italy, Austria, Hungary a Soviet seems to have been the prelude to revolution at Budapest the Scandinavian countries, the Balkans the Bulgarian collapse was claimed by the &quot; Berner Tagwacht&quot; as a triumph for Bolshevik propaganda.To a certain extent Switzerland seems to be losing its value as a Bolshevik centre. Two or three months ago no ground could have seemed more favourable. Not only was there a very active group of revolutionary agents deliberately carrying out Lenin&apos;s repeatedly expressed instructions, but even certain bourgeois circles seemed to be by no means unfavourably inclined towards the Moscow Government. The way in which such bourgeois papers as the &quot;Neue Zuroher Zeitung&quot; (which at least preserved its independence by insisting on paying for them) printed the &quot;r.n.&quot; messages was significant. Far more important was the Swiss official attitude, which was at one time, shortly after Berzine&apos;s arrival, distinctly inclined to recognise the Bolshevik Government. The visit of Karl Moor to Moscow in August, and his two hours&apos; inter-view before his departure with Herr Schulthess, former Swiss President, and now Bundesrat and head of the Volkswirtschaftsdepartement, certainly had, in spite of dementis, a semi-official character. Nothing more may have been behind these events than a desire in Swiss official circles to protect Swiss financial interests in Russia (about 500 million fr. in value). But whatever the motive, it was clear, both from the temper of the Swiss Socialists and the bourgeois official attitude, that Bolshevism had advantages in Switzerland such, as it enjoyed nowhere else in Europe.Recently there have been&apos; changes. In the first place a large number of &quot; Russlandschweizer &quot; have returned, telling of the atrocities of Bolshevik rule.* Then several of the Swiss Socialists have taken up a definitely critical attitude towards the extreme class-war tactics of Lenin and his followers. Even so restless a Social Democrat as Paul Graber attacked Karl Moor, whose mission to Moscow was also denounced by another Socialist Nationalrat, Jacques Schmid, editor of the influential &quot;Neue Freie Zeitung&quot; of 01ten,f and when Flatten last September attempted to introduce into the Nationalrat a resolution calling for the recognition, of the Bolsheviks by the Swiss Government, he received little support even from his comrades. The recent expulsion of the Leninite, Herzog, from the Zurich &quot; Kreis&quot; of the party is one more sign of the awakening in Swiss Social Democratic circles to the danger of unrestrained agitation on Leninite lines in favour of a. mass revolution.* See the book by one of them, &quot; La liussie rouge,&quot; by Camille Dudan, Lausanne, 1918.f Schmid had earlier, March 1918, attacked what he conceived to be the mistaken policy of Platten in a pampblet enutled &quot;Die Erdrosselung der sozialen  evolution in Kussland durch den deutschen Militarismus.&quot;
It would be nevertheless a mistake, notwithstanding such indications as these, to neglect the still considerable potential importance of Switzerland in this connection. From Switzerland, at least to a partial extent, the contagion of Bolshevism has spread into Austria-Hungary ; to judge from recent reports in the &quot; Ziircher Volksrecht,&quot; usually well-informed in these matters, it is spreading rapidly in Northern Italy where, during the beginning of October, a general strike, embracing Milan and Turin, was reported to be in operation.^ It will spread, and is indeed rapidly spreading, in Germany, already infected in the south from Switzerland. France may withstand the attack, sustained by the invigoration of victory, but no one can overlook the fact that Lenin has his French agents, several, of whom have been in constant communication with Switzerland during the war from the days of the first Zimmerwald Conference until now. In regard to this country and America, the British censorship can supply sufficient evidence as to the importance of Switzerland from our point of view. From Switzerland several more subsidiary centres of Bolshevik contagion will have been established, necessitating the utmost vigilance, whether the war shall have ended or not. That, and not the ingenuity of German propaganda, is the plainest, certainly the safest, lesson to be drawn from the history of Switzerland as a Bolshevik centre during the war.November 2, 1918.o* It may be pointed put that the well-known revolutionary Madame Balabanoff has, recently arrived in Switzerland, from Stockholm with the mission, according to tne &quot; Neues Stuttgarter Tagblatt,&apos;&apos;&apos; of providing a revolution in Italy (aee &quot; Journal de Geneve,&quot; October 26,1918).        &apos;
