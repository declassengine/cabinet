SMORANDUM BY THE FOOD CONTROLLER.i       The War Cabinet on the 1st October last (War Cabinet 480.minute 6) -decided, in order to maintain adequate munitions importation, that food importation   Into this country in the present Cereal Year should jbe on a scale which, while maintaining stocks of human food at a sufficient level, involved the severest possible rationing of dairy and breeding stock, and made no provision for the cottager&apos;a pig, -conditions which could only be justified by supreme military necessity,For several days past, it has been obvious that, with the changed military situation, such limitation could not be maintained, and as it was the quickest possible measure of relief, I at once gave instructions that arrangements should be made to release for animal feeding all the barley grown in this country which can be spared after making suitable provision for the volume of brewing permitted by the Cabinet.In this connection, 1 should be glad of the sanction of the Cabinet to an increase in the price of malting barley from 67/- to 70/- as I am -advised that if thia concession is not made, insufficient barley will ibe forthcoming for this purpose.The barley release will give some relief, but large further supplies I of feeding stuffs would be required before the Agricultural position of the country can be said to be placed on a satisfactory footing.   Animal feeding stuffs are not available for importation from North America in sufficient quantities, and I em accordingly proposing to arrange, through ;the Inter-Allied Food Council, the Allied Maritime Transport Council and the Ministry of Shipping, for large importations of maize from the Argentine Republicj but as the supplies can only be obtained in quantity iby means of shipping which is now engaged on the North American Route, no relief will be obtained from this source,until March 1919 at the I earliest.In my opinion, it would not be right, in the national interest, to iendeavour to restrict farm production to a strict war ba3is for so long a period.The main food difficulties which have to be faced, and which will assume serious proportions inthe near future, are shortage of dairy jproduce and shortage of meatf/^oththese difficulties can only be met by jan increased feeding stuffs supply in the immediate future.   The only Uource from which this supply can be obtained under present conditions Is by reducing the Milling extraction and so producing more milling I offals and reverting to a white loaf.   There appears to be no danger, jfrom the point of view of supply, in adopting thi3 course, since there are very large stocks of wheat at the seaboard at North America awaiting shipment, and If, as is likely to be the case, shipment of munitions is ; severely restricted, there would be large numbers of ships on the North jAtlantic Route urgently seeking cargoes..   Added to this, the stocks in jthis country are ample to meet the present needs,I, therefore, propose, with the sanction of the War Cabinet, to give immediate instructions to the Flour Hills to grind nothing but reheat and gradually to reduce the extraction to 70$*   This policy will increase the amount of feeding stuffs available by some 18,000 tons per week.If the offals are sold at present prices, this course would involve the Treasury in an additional los3 on the bread subsidy of some  200,000 per week, but as the quality of offals will be greatly Improved, I propose to halve this loss by increasing the present price by  2*5.0 per ton, and I should also hope to make a substantial profit by the sale of maize as and when it arrives. -
It Is Impossible to estimate the exact profits which would 2 secured in this way, but at present prices It would seem possible at maize would find a ready sale at  2*10c0 or  3 a ton above the st price, and it should be possible to secure and sell 500^000 tons,While the financial effect of the whole transaction cannot be ;curately estimated at this stage, I urge that tho Cabinet should ermit the necessary orders to be given at once, as an enormous gain 111 result to the Agricultural situation of the country and to the nole Food Supply situation,1 therefore ask Cabinet approval:-1, To an increase in the pricos of Malting Barley from 67/- to 70/-.2. Gradually to reduce tho rate of milling extraction from 00% to 70$ involving an increase In thefctoead subsidy estimated to amount to about  100,000 per weeks.R* CLYNSS.Ministry of Food,&apos; 8th November 1918,
