Confidential,I 7LABOUR POSITION IN MUNITION INDUSTRIES, *\ (6th November 1918.)111- ^I circulate the following notes which have been prepared in the Intelligence and Statistics Section of the Ministry of Munitions on the labour position in munition industries.Statistics for Week ending the 30th October 1918.During the week ending the 30th October 22,424 days-one-seventh of 1 per cent, of the possible working time were lost through strikes by munition workers.^ The strike of Cumberland iron ore miners and that of the aircraft woodworkers in Liverpool accounted for nearly the whole of the time lost.The Aircraft Difficulty.During the past week the Liverpool aircraft workers&apos; strike has been terminated, and a conference is being pressed on to achieve a final settlement of the points outstanding between the Ministry and the National Woodworkers&apos; Aircraft Committee concerning the extension of systems of payment by results in this new industry. The output bonus scheme which was introduced at Aintree has been suspended pending further negotiations. On their part the National Woodworkers&apos; Aircraft Committee undertake that none of the trade union members who have been threatened with expulsion or with fines for working under the scheme shall be penalised. The Ministry was prepared to take strong action had it been judged desirable to do so, but in view of all the circumstances of the situation, it was decided that the balance of practical advantage lay with the settlement that has been concluded.A conference between the Ministry and the National Woodworkers&apos; Aircraft Committee is to meet immediately to discuss (1) the question of consulting with the particular establishment or with the district, as a preliminary to the introduction in any factory of payment by results; and (2) the question of the punishment by woodworking unions of members who work under such systems.* For the purpose of these statistics, munition workers are taken to include all classes of workers in lespect of whom the Ministry of Munitions would intervene in the event of a strike, (a) in the munition industries proper (metals, chemicals and rubber) ; and (6) in certain auxiliary industries, e.g., iron ore mining, brick making, timber sawing, &quot;certified&quot; gas and electricity undertakings, etc.WINSTON S.
