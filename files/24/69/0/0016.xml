Russia/01^)1. THE future of Trans-Caucasia is part of the general problem of the future of the Russian Border States, though it has special features. The establishment of an armistice with Turkey, especially if this opens up the Black Sea to the British fleet, will make it both possible and urgently necessary to consider at once the lines of a future settlement of these districts. It is suggested that the wisest plan would be that any settlement should start from the principle of self-determination ; this would imply the recognition of Georgia, Armenia, and the Tatars as free independent States, which it is hoped will ultimately come into a federal union with one another. This would also imply that they should be free, at any rate in the meantime, from Russian dominion, and that the Caucasus should become the frontier of a restored Russia. The possibility of their voluntary return into a stable and liberalised Federation of Russian States should not, however, be absolutely foreclosed.2. All this almost necessarily implies, however, that it may be necessary to depute some Western Power to watch over, assist and control these nationalities in their efforts with self-government, and if some such sort of control was found to be necessary, it would of course be most convenient, since no suitable Government is likely to be established in Russia for a considerable period, that this duty should be delegated by the Peace Conference either to Great Britain an extension bf a Mesopotamia!! Protectorate, or to the United States of America, because of her Anatolian and Armenian interests.3. The first desideratum, of course, is the withdrawal of all Turkish and German forces, including all individuals, whether civilian or military, who may have been left behind for the purpose of propaganda. This is particularly important with regard to Georgia. In addition to being the most compact and homogeneous, Georgia to-day is probably the most advanced, politically and economically, of the three nationalities. During the later years of the war the Georgians have been the special object of German attention, both on account of their racial characteristics and the potential wealth of their country. Latterly, in face of force majeure, and particularly in order to with-stand the aggressive designs of the Turks, the German orientation of the Georgians became distinctly pronounced, although they have never committed themselves in a degree comparable, for example, to that of Finland. Several independent sources testify to their desire to be absolutely free from German domination. There seems to be no doubt that certain far-reaching business contracts have been entered into between the German authorities and the Georgian Government, sometimes with Swedes as intermediaries for the exploitation, for example, of the manganese deposits. So far as anything in the nature of commercial treaties have been entered into between these Governments, a demand should be made for their cancellation; while, on the other hand, in view of British trade interests, Batum should be declared a free port, as was provided for in the Treaty of 1878, with free access by railway to Armenia, Baku, Persia, and Central Asia.4. The Georgian claim for independence is based upon their historical continuity from the third century (b.c), and the maintenance of their political independence till 1801 under a series of most trying circumstances and invasions. The Georgians are not merely anxious to state their claims to independence under the principle of self-determination endorsed by the Allies, but also on their treaty rights of 1783 with Russia, which were violated by that country. De jure Georgia has full right to determine her position. In this respect she is in a stronger position than any other nationality in the former Russian Empire, for she was never conquered by Russia. The boundaries of a soundly historic and ethnographic Georgia can be traced at any rate provisionally, although complications may arise in more than one border district, owing to the influx of Armenian refugees in past decades, and expressions of doubt as to the
orientation of certain Moslem Georgian elements. Owing to the ravages of war, all pre-war statistics and population-distributions are more or less untrustworthy to-day; accordingly, the whole situation seems to calJ for investigation on the spot by a joint Allied Commission.5. The Armenian claim for independence, or, to express it otherwise, the formation of an Armenian protectorate under an international guarantee with mandatory powers to one of the guarantors, would naturally involve the union of the six Turkish vilayets and Kilikia, and the Russian Armenian provinces. This represents the main current of Armenian opinion. It is possible, however, that such a union, which must come about if there is to be any Armenia at all, will not be favourably regarded by all Russian Armenians, some of whom have never professed any interest in their compatriots of Turkish Armenia, and may even prefer to remain linked with Russia rather than enter such a united Armenia. A territory of this extent, with an outlet to the Black Sea at Trebizond, is greatly disproportionate to the present Armenian population, and would be shared to a very large extent with the Kurds, whose rights would require to be safe-guarded. There is some reason to suppose that these two peoples would not have great difficulty in coming to an understanding if left to settle matters by themselves, i.e., apart from Russian or Turkish intriguing and interference, under the aforesaid Protectorate.6. The third element is the potential Tatar Republic, comprising the Governments of Baku and Elisahetpol, to which Dagestan on the North and Persian Azerbaijan are added in the minds of Tatar and Turkish expansionists like Enver Pasha. The crux of the situation is the question of the ability of a possible Tatar element composed of Baku and Elisabetpol to form a self-governing element alongside of Georgia and Armenia ; for if this is not possible, it would be difficult to avoid handing these last elements back to Russia, which raises the final question of the relation of these three elements to Russia. . -7. We assume then that the Georgians are able to conduct their own affairs, and the Armenian Protectorate likewise able to be self-maintaining; and it may be pointed out that other countries, like Modern Greece, have not been at any more advanced stage of political development than these two elements are to-day, at the time that independence was given to them. At the present moment, so far as indications go, the onus of disproof of the ability of the Tatar element also to maintain itself in co-operation with and alongside of the other two, would seem to lie with those who are opposed to the idea of the formation and federation of the three Trans-Caucasian States, and while the question of their possible future reunion with Russia ought not to be foreclosed, the following considerations ought to be borne in mind : 8 The Russian elements in Trans-Caucasia numbered at the beginning of the war 280,000, including an army of 150,000, out of some 7,000,000. In view of the collapse of German aspirations beyond the Danube, it looks as if the key-stone of British policy with regard to the Farther East may need to be&apos; the assumption of a, protectorate over these three Trans-Caucasian elements, or at least the furnishing of them with assistance towards their development as political unities on ethnographical, lines. From this point of view it is therefore a serious question whether it may not be better to discourage Russian advances beyond Cis-Caucasia, that is to say, confine her to the northern side of the Caucasus, thus making Trans-Caucasia a barrier to any future Russian aspirations towards the south-east. For it is advisable not to close our eyes to the fact that the populations to the north west of the Caucasus are the Kuban and Don Cossacks. The Ukraine also has a large Cossack element, and it is probable that sooner or later these elements will attempt to revive the old Russian policy of aggressive expansion towards the south-east. This policy may also be stimulated by the pressure of immigration from Northern Russia, unless this can bb diverted regularly towards Siberia; but, on the other hand, the -attraction of the warmer south and its waters will always be irresistible. With an internationalised Dardanelles, Russian aggressive movement beyond the Caucasus could only be predatorv in purpose, and the difficulty of restoring Baku to Russia lies in the fact that il she is given any footing in Trans-Caucasia she will inevitably attempt to recover all her former possessions. With the oil-fields of Grozny and Maikop and the ports of Derbent and Petrovsk she will not suffer essential loss or means of direct -communication with her Trans-Caspian possessions.^* The main objection to this policy lies in the circumstance that, under the Supplementary Treaty between Germany and liusda, the town of Baku was left to Russia, and if, might be invidious for the Allies to impose upon Russia terms more disadvantageous than those allowed by Germany. Moreover, the oilfields of Baku are of really vital interest both to Russian and to European industry.
9. At the moment, the Ukraine appears to be working hand in hand with the reactionary elements in Great Russia, with the object of assuming some power of attorney for all Russia at the Peace Conference. It is probable that the Ukraine will press for the association of Eastern Galicia, Bessarabia, and the whole of the Caucasus on the pretence of creating a federation of these centres ; and the present pressure of the Kuban Cossacks towards the Sukhum district is probably instigated by military considerations with a view to keeping the door along the Black fSea open for a later invasion of the whole of Trans-Caucasia.November 1, 1918.
