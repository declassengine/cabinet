&apos;V^\      -hi?J^u!!!^ Is the Property of       J 7I circulate this memorandum for the early con-sideration of. the Cabinet,//- $ NOV 1918RELIEF policy the districts requiring relief may be classified as follows:(1) Allied territory evacuated by the enemy* (2) Enemy territory inhabited by friendly peoples, e. . Jugo-Slavs.   For convenience this category can also include Poland, V/ostern Russia and Finlandn[5] Austrian and other enemy territory proper0 V/ith regard to (1) the French will presumably take care of French territory and the Belgian Relief Committee of Belgium until the Belgian&quot; Government can do so.As regards [Z) and (3) decisions are required, Besides.actual food stuffs there will be re-quired by the friendly peoples in category (2) clothing5 housing and seed wheat and the means of restaring agricultural and industrial life.If supplies are to be given an organisation must be set up which will receive and examine the statements of requirements, obtain the supplies and arrange for distribution through local committees with headquarters at various centres in the countries to be relieveda   A sketch of the necessary organiaa-tion is anna^;ed*Proposals
Proposals havo been made to the United states and French Governments that aa regards Serbia, food ana clothing should he supplied by an inter-allied organisation and that His Kajostyu- Government, the United States Government and the French Government should contribute in eou&amp;l chares...   Ho reply has been received.Bu&apos;o since these proposals were made tho question has assumed larger proportions; it is not now a question merely of a local Committee at 3alonica or elsewhere x,o deal with Serbia but of a central Inter-allied body with numerous outposts at the various distribution centres.As regards category (2), the food position in Austria, especially in the Tyrol and Vienna, is very serious.  Numerous representations have been received e.g. from the French Embassy and Swedish Legation pressing for reliefoTho Austrian armistice terms provide that exist-ing blockade conditions are to remain unchanged(Cl.5) if food is retired from outside; this provision seems to impose an obligation on the Allies to provide it or to facilitate its import,It is suggested that the same inter-allied Organisation which deals with category (2) should also deal with enemy countries.
The following&apos; quest ions aro submitted to tho Cabinet:lo Should relief .raoasuros be undertaken in con-junction tfVith the Allied Governments concerned for Austria and Germany as well as for countries in category (2)?2, At whose expense is the work to he undertaken? It is suggested that the United States, Prance and Great Britain should share equally, but it is possible that France may think she has enough bo do in France and Syria; if so, .shall the United States and Great Britain do the work together, each bearing half theCr^St?3. what Department should he responsible for the work?   It is suggested that some existing inter-allied arganisation should form the executive and charge that executive with the duty of forming the local bodies.It is reported in u&apos;Tho Times&apos;1 that fir. Hoover, is about uo como to Europe to confer on the best means of furnishing supplies to the liberated peoples,It seems most desirable that the United States should take a leading: part.The ministry of 3?oo&amp; is the British organisation most closely in touch with ar. Hoover and it seems tohave
have had under consideration the supply of food to the liberated areas and as it has an inter-allied organisa-tion, it seems a suitable department to undertake the executive work. . -Alternatively the work might bo undertaken by the ministry of Blockade, but in that case an inter-allied authority would have to be formed ad hoc; if one.was so formed tho reconstruction work in territory of friendly peoples should be carried out by the same organisation.In either case the closest touch must be kept with the I-inistry of shipping as the supply of food can be used as a lever to obtain control by the inter-Allied Haritime Transport Council of enemy owned shipping.
Scheme for Relief in period immediately after the conclusion of hostilities^1, ALLIED RELIEF COW? OIL.a. There should he set up in London an AlliedRelief Council., consisting of French, British and united States Representatives0   Each country should send two delegates,ho This Council should he supported by aSecretariat as follows:ip A Secretary, with central staff necessary for-co-ordination,,ii. Under this central staff should bs various sections dealing with specific subjects, ecgo finance, transport and supply,iii. Liaison officers should be appointed to keep in touch with the Food Council, Transport Council, CIJU or other Supply Organisations, Treasury, Foreign Office and United States and French Embassies02- LOCAL EXECUTIVES.a0 Local.executives should he set up by the Relief Council wherever necessary, (e,gP Piume, Salonica, Smyrna, Alexandretta, Constantinople, Trebizond, Batoum, Constanzo, Danzic, Warsaw)0 Branch executives would be necessary at certain places, ePgo Antivari, Durazzo0
bo These local executives should be inter-allied and should act in conjunction with the Government of the country concerned, who should appoint representatives tc the Council.Co The local executives would (i) ascertain the needs of the people and report to the London Council: (ii) set up and control all organisations necessary for the distribution of relief in the country c one erne cLd. Organisation of local executives3   This could be on the same lines as that of the London Council0 Possibly the representative of the local Government should act as chairman.   There would be various officers dealing with the specific subjects covered by each of the sections of the London secretariat0 Representatives of Red Cross Societies, independent oharitable bodies, relief funds, cC would keep in touch with or be represented on the local councilsaet The local executives should aim at passing the control and responsibility as rapidly as possible into the hands of the Government of the country in question and should endeavour to make their period of responsibility as short as possible consistently with the task being properly done0
3* DISTRIBUTIVE CR^TISATIONS.a. These would be under the local executives and would be entrusted with the actual work&quot; of administer-ing relief to the population,b(, The same sectional division could be applied as is roccriTmended for the sections of the London Secretariat,,   The Red Gross Societies and any in-dependent charitable organisations would play a larger part under this heading &apos;Co These organisations would consist partly of sinal 1 establishments in various centres in the country and partly of officers deputed to travel about for purposes of inspection, control and report0J i ..M1 ..L\I Oxj oThe governments represented on the Council would presumably contribute funds to support the work and the organisation.,   This might best be done in equal proportions,Tii,30ia\IIL.Apart from, tho delegates on the Council, the . most important consideration will be to find -a0 A Secretary for the London Secretariat, with suitable staff including heads of sections and liaison officers0b07-7- O
1 ?*?JL U w&quot;bo. Sxpe-rienced men as heads of the localexecutives, these might &quot;be found in the existing Red Cross and other organisa-ti Ons aCo A staff to he appointed &quot;by the AlliedRelief Council to act as secretaries of the local executives and inspectors to act under the local executivesn
