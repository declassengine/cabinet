It is of interest to note that 7 aerodromes in the Mons-Avesnes area have already been vacated.Now aerodromes are being located as follows :
GENERAL,The chief point of interest is the increase in Scout activity in the OUDINARDE, TOURNAI-VALENCIEM8S area, and the decrease South of LE Quesnoy.Flanders. 11 aerodromes;   4 of whioh are between Moerbeck and the Dutch Frontier, and 4 others in the   ^ioinity of Termonde.Lillo. 6 aerodromes.     The majority of those are situated in the vicinity of Aoh.Lena. 8 aerodromes.   6 of these are situated near the Ath-Mons road, and 2 others a,little to the N.E. of Charleroi.St. Quentin.   11 aerodromes.     Most of these are situated to the South ot Maubeuge and in the vicinity of Fourraies.Laon, 6 aerodromes.    All in tho Ticinity to the North of Vervins,Destruction of Landing Grounds.Evidently with the intention of preventing our future use of his aerodromes the enemy has begun the destruction of landing grounds.   In Flanders photographs show that the landing ground at St. Denis Westrem aerodrome has been destroyed, the surface having been ploughed up by a aeries of transverse furrows and a large number of explosive charges placed at intervals in the ground, some of which have already been detonated.At Mariakerke aerodrome the ground is being ploughed up in the same way as that at St.Denis Westrem, but the work is not quite oompleted.     There is no evidence yet of explosive charges, but this would not be done till the ploughing was finished.An emergency landing ground at Rosdam (22.G.27.d.), just S.W. of St. Denis Westrem, has also been rendered unfit for use.Enemyfs Attitude.Prom the Dutch Frontier to the R0TJBA1X CANAL.Scout Activity showed groat increase, except in the South portion of this sector, and it is evident that there has been a reinforcement of Scout machines.ROUBAIX CANAL to the CONDE CANAL.Scout activity has increased, especially South of this Sector.   Large formations have been encountered showing a mor,e aggressive attitude.OONDE CANAL to the PISE.- Scout activity in tho North portion of this Sector has also increased. Large formations attempted to harass our bombing and reconnaissance machines.
Distribution of German Bombing Forces on the Western Front. - (Twin&quot;engine ana&quot; Giant machines).Tho location of the bombing squadrons is still uncertain.     It would appear however, that squadrons with one exception are still operating from the same sectors but are based further in rear.     The Lens Sector has been decreased by 36 machines (No.5 Squadron) which is reported to be at Brussels with the 3rd Squadron.Losses in German Air Forces - Vies tern Front.Aeroplanes.The total losses sustained by the enemy on the Western front, due to British activities from the beginning of January 1918 to November 2nd 1918, are as followsWestern Front (R.A.F. with the Armies in the Field)2702 machines destroyed 1094 out of controlTOTAL      3796 machines5th Group(R.A.F. with the Navy - Dover &amp; Dunkirk)205 machines destroyed 197 out of controlTOTAL       402 machinesIndependent Force (From May&quot; 26&apos;th    November 2nd)60 machines destroyed 42 out of controlTOTAL  .    102 machinesGRAND TOTAL   * 4300 machines,GERMAN Y.        Airships.During the past fortnight little activity has been displayed.     There is nothing of importance to report.Seaplanes.North Sea.Patrol activity has remained normal in the North Sea, when weather has permitted, which has been seldom, and few sightings and no combats have been reported.
A flight of machines (apparently PurtJiiit^planes-) g has been identified at Baltrum, the island&apos; due east of Norderney, where it was not previously known that a station existed.     This may represent preparations previously under-taken in prospect of the increase of strength of the station due to the evacuation of Ogtond fcnd Zeebrugge.A Report, of considerable interest has been received, which states that an nR&apos;! Abteilung (i.e. a Giant Plight) of Monoplane, four-engined (240 Mayoach), Plying Boats is stationed at Nordeivifcy-     This is quite possible, as Giant Seaplanes have been known to have been k      - tested at Warnemunde Versuohs-station for some time past.     These machines are stated to have an endurance of 15 hours,, but their speed and climb are said to be very slow.     They are armed with three m,gs.Baltic.In the Baltic the routine patrols of the Little Belt, the Sound and the Kattegat, have continued when meteorologies] conditions have rendered them possible.Monoplane seaplanes and large biplane seaplanes have been reported from a reliable source to have been stationed at Stralsund up to a fortnight ago.     These are probably used solely for instructional purposes, and appeared to follow no routine of patrols.4. MISCELLANEOUS.GERMANY.Aeroplanes.Prom photographs, the details previously reported regarding the Albatros C3CV are confirmed.A new type of Albatros single seater, presumably the D Vb. has been reported from Palestine.A new two seater Halberstadt (Type C V) has been captured.   Its construction and engine are similar to those previously reported for the C L V and these two machines are probably of one type.A Junker two seater J I has been captured.   It is armoured and its wings are covered with corrugated sheet duralumin,,A report has been received relating to the Schleifor bomber,, made by C-otha Co.      It corresponds very largely to thet&apos;Gotha G V but has a smaller bomb load.The existence of the Siemens Schuckert monoplane has been reliably confirmed and it should appear in a few weeks.Engines.A report has been received that Daimlers are manufacturing a 12 cylinder between type valveless engine.Seaplanes.Prom a photograph it would appear that the Fokker Co. are engaged in the manufacture of seaplanes although the extent of their activities is not known.     The type shown in
the photograph has a span of about 70 feet and Is. a. biplane with large extensions on top planes.The Hans a and fcrandenberg Flugzeugworke JUG. have absorbed the Oorty Co.Armament.The oonstruction of the 50 Kg, H.E. streamline bomb has been modified apparently mainly in order to simplify manufacture.AUSTRIA *Aeroplanes.The details received concerning the   Berg single seater, Types 57 and 137 confirms previous Information in the main.    The former has a speed of 112 m.p.h. and the latter of 119 m.p.h.      Both have an endurance of 2-1 hours.
