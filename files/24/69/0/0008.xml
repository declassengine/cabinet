&apos;1Z*- nOSTOaiR.Jg,jPm ,^OPrjig&amp; OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S G-OVERpfENT1)- CAS^X &apos;  &quot;  28SECRET .g* P T / OA^ * II&quot;O- IN 19 IB - 1919.RELEASES FOR KPNITIONS 7?0RK. Memorandum by the ICinlster .o.f National Service.I am not altogether clear whether Mr. Churchill&apos;s Memorandum (G.T.6154) of the 23rd October is intended to over-ride his previous Memorandum (G.T*5827) of the 25th September.     In the former he Stated that the Ministry of Munitions would do everything in their power to meet the recruiting requirements as set out in my Memorandum T.5660 dated 10th September, and that he considered that the numeri-bal quota asked for should be maintained and could probably even be (improved upon.     The concluding passage of the Memorandum was as follows&quot;To maintain the army at its fullest possible strength in divisions, to keep the battalions of those divisions at their full strength during the decisive battle months, to supply it with every form of munition and equipment which it can use are the primary objects for which v/e should labour now.&quot;:   *In the second Memorandum Kr. Churchill sets out a schedule of rades in which a special protection will be needed for the youths [of the 1900 class; and he states further that if the programmes of tunitions production are to be realised, it will be a matter of the fereatest difficulty to release any further skilled men at all. This memorandum proceeds to ask for the immediate release from the Army Ind the Air Force of 7,000 skilled men.The demands of the Air Force for skilled personnel are large; nd it is unlikely that any considerable number of skilled recruits ill be obtained even for that service.    There is therefore little rospect of the Air Force being able to meet any part of the require-ents of the Ministry of Munitions.I appreciate the complexity of.the munitions programmes and the labour difficulties involved.    Hy immediate object is not, however* o ask for a decision from the &quot;/ar Cabinet, but to suggest that before he question of releases ia brought before the Cabinet, the whole losition should be fully investigated by the WarjDfflee, the Ministry ]f Munitions and the Ministry of National Service; and that ahould itnecessary to approach the War Cabinet at a later date, proposals hould be made after full consideration by the Departments concerned.I am suggesting this course to tiie Secretary of State for War and pie Minister of Munitions,A. C. GEDDES,9.11.18.
