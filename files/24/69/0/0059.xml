iVio. the P(nment.)I09I 0M i 0DEMOBILISATION.Koto by tho iiniator of Labour.Sir Stsphenson Kont has suggested to m that it la doairablo that all orders restricting amusements ahould be withdrawn ay far as possible on the signing of the armistice, and that homo-racing, football and othor 3porta should be encouraged to tho greatest poaaible oxtofofc.It 1b understood that the War Office do not contemplate marching processions of men fron the returning Armies through London and the large provincial towna.   As auoh processions appear to be possible under the Donobillsa-tion Scheme it is suggested that thoy should take place.   I note that Colons1 Norton uriffiths makes the sane suggestion in his letter to kr. Auatin OhamberJSjain (G.T.6195).I agree that during the period of difficulty in industrial centres it is moat important that public opinion ahould be stirred to the highest pitch.(Signed)   Geo. H,Roberts.11/11/ie.
