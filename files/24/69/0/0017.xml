v^h...cabinet//v^^      ^ ^ This Document la th* property of^^^^^^^g^fg^of stafce for india- (Z^^uiy^v^SECRET. &quot; &amp;JCommunication of information on matters of Imperial concern to the Viceroy of India.In his speech in the House of Commons on 17th May 1917 the Prime Minister announced the decision that meetings of the Imperial Cabinet would be held annually or at any intermediate time when circumstances required it. At the same time he announced that the Imperial Cabinet would consist of the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and such of his colleagues as deal specially with Imperial affairs, of the Prime Minister of each of the Dominions or some specially accredited representative possessed of equal authority, and of a representative of the Indian people to be appointed by the Government of India.In accordance with this decision, Sir S. P. Sinha, who had attended the Imperial War Cabinet in 1917 as an adlatus to the Secretary of State, attended in 1.918 as the representative of the Indian people appointed by the Government of India.The intention of the change was to recognise the altered position of India in the Empire. It was an admission of the claim made by responsible leaders of Indian opinion that the position of India should, so far as circumstances allow, be made analogous to that of the self-governing Dominions. Similarly, in the message from the Prime Minister to the Viceroy which was entrusted to Sir S. P. Sinha on his return, the Prime Minister used these words: &quot; India has held a fitting place in our councils &quot; of war, to which she has added her weight through her accredited representatives, &quot; and when the time comes, she will have no less worthy a place in our deliberations &quot; of peace and reconstruction.&quot; In accordance with this assurance I have to-day telegraphed to the Viceroy, suggesting that Sir S. P. Sinha should be invited to return to this country as soon as possible, so that he may participate in the deliberations of Imperial concern which are now in progress. Again, in the announcement authorised by the War Cabinet on the subject of channels of communication between the self-governing dominions and His Majesty&apos;s Government, the following passage occurs: &quot; It has also been decided that each Dominion shall have the right to nominate a &quot; visiting or resident Minister in London to be a Member of the Imperial War Cabinet &quot; at meetings other than those attended by the Prime Ministers,&quot; and it was added that arrangements would be made for the representation of India at these meetings.While Iudia&apos;s position differs in. important aspects from that of the sell-governing Dominions, the passages I have cited above show, I think, conclusively, that it is the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government to treat her in regard to the important questions arising out of the war as entitled to the fullest representation compatible with her position, and as deserving of the high confidence which participation in our deliberations implies.In the course of the last fortnight when matters of peace and war have been under discussion questions have arisen in which India is very closely interested. The position of the conquered territories in Mesopotamia and the Middle East, and other questions, such as the reparation for lost mercantile tonnage and the future allocation of raw materials, affect her intimately. It would be in accordance with the policy so far adopted that in such matters the responsible head of the Indian Govern-ment should be kept fully apprised of what is taking place. In this connection I have observed that certain Foreign Office telegrams from Paris have included the instruction, &quot; Please arrange with Colonial Office to repeat to Dominions,&quot; or similar words. The contention I would advance is that as our policy has been to take India fully into our confidence in war matters, and as it is the expressed intention of the Prime Minister to extend the same confidence to her in questions affecting peace and reconstruction, India should be treated in the same way as the Dominions Governments. I have had no difficulty when I have seen telegrams of die kind to which I refer, and whenever the subject has arisen it has been obvious that India is not left out of any set purpose, but merely from oversight.I would therefore ask that Departments and private secretaries in particular should be informed that when the Dominions are being mentioned in such connection India should be included and I may be directly put into a position to communicate with, the Viceroy.6th November 1918.
