(This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majestys Government.IINTERNAL CONDITIONS IN GERMANY, NOVEMBER 8, 1918.[THE following is a portion of a report which was written on the 7th and 8th November. The abdication of the Emperor and the appointment of the Majority Socialist leader Ebert as Chancellor in succession to Prince Max, as well as many other revolutionary events throughout Germany, have rendered much of what follows obsolete ; but the report is submitted as dealing with the following points : 1. The attitude of the people towards the Emperor before the revolution.2. The conditions at Kiel and in the Navy which favoured the revolutionary out-break and determined its character.3. The dissolution of Germany and Prussia on their periphery ; Posen and Silesia; Alsace-Lorraine (the refusal of the popular Chamber to form a parliamentary Government or to prejudge, in a German sense, the future of the provinces); North Schleswig.4. The prospect of accretions on the south-eastern frontiers of Prussia, Saxony, andBavaria ; the Bohemian Germans ; the Austrian Germans. 5. Attempt of Germany to levy duties on traffic on the Rhine; protest by the . Netherlands Government.]Events in Germany are undermining the whole structure of the pretended democratic Government which was set up on the 5th October in Berlin. The Reichstag itself, under Socialist leadership, made short work of some of the attempts of the Federal Council to reserve for the Emperor a decisive voice, e.g., in questions of peace or war, in cases where the pretext could be set up, as at the outbreak of the present war, that Germany was being attacked. It was enacted that the assent of the Reichstag, both to the declaration of war and the conclusion of peace, should in all circumstances be indispensable. Meanwhile, the behaviour of the Emperor during the September-October crisis, his letter to the King of Bavaria describing his action as a &quot; concession,&quot; his official letter to the Imperial Chancellor representing himself as a sudden convert to democracy, and, finally, his flight for so it was interpreted to the army, together with the continued reactionary interferences by the Home Commands in civil affairs, have combined to make the demand for his abdication too insistent to be evaded. Neither Conservative appeals to patriotism nor weak-kneed Radical attempts to shift the whole blame of Germanys immeasurable disaster on to ludendorff&apos;s shoulders, have availed to stem the tide of revolution that is rising against William II and his dynasty. The &quot; Frankfurter Zeitung,&quot; which has for the last generation stood between democracy and Kaiserism, swinging its censer now in the one direction, now in the other, has abandoned the whole game, and thus dismisses the latest attempt to rally the country for a final effort by the familiar catch-words of Prussian militarism and monarchy i &quot; In view of the miserable experiences of former days, there is not much danger that in Germany there could ever again be a Government which would dare to ask the German people, after its unspeakable sacrifices, to fight and to bleed for a watchword which is nothing but the impudent swindle of a bankrupt conception of the universe.&quot;*The patience of the people, whose sons and brothers have been slain by the million in the calamitous Imperial gamble for world-power, who themselves are now underfed, unwarmed, miserably clad, overworked, has come to an end. The mere mention of the &quot;nurnberg bauble&quot;! drives them to fury. But they were unarmed, and the iron discipline of the army as well as its absorption in the tasks of the war has till now prevented &quot; the people in arms &quot; from making common cause with the people in rags.* &quot; Frankfurter Zeitung,&apos;&apos; 26th October, Evening Ed., No. 297.t The name given by the Brandenburg Junkers to the Hohenzollern dynasty in its early days, its founder having been Friedrich IV of Ntirnberg, who in 1415 bought the Margraviate of Brandenburg from, the Emperor Sigismund.CONFIDENTIAL 10Political Intelligence Department,Foreign Office.Germany,-021.
It is in the navy that the spirit of revolt has first found vent. Over a year ago there was an outbreak in the navy, of which no accurate or complete account has yet been obtainable, but which is said to have led to the murder of officers, and is known to have been punished by the execution of several ringleaders. The subject was raised in the Reichstag, and the tactless way in which the ephemeral Chancellor, Michaelis, treated it helped to bring about his ignominious fall. Discipline in the German navy has never been so effective as in the army. The officers are largely men who have not imbibed from their youth the free spirit of the sea, many of the seamen suffer under the same disability, while thousands who are taken from the hardy fisherman class of the Baltic towns and villages and the North Sea coasts and islands have a contempt for those of their superiors and their comrades who have had no share in their own early training and experience. -The methods by which the unruly crews, without great traditions or the hope of a great future, were kept in hand were a mixture of savagery and cajolery.At Kiel, the mushroom growth of enormous shipbuilding yards and workshops, the importation of a mass of Social Democratic workmen, the poverty of the over-strained municipality, the heavy local taxation, and the contrast between the hardships of the proletariat and the self-indulgent casino life of the officer and yachtsman class have long fostered the growth of a discontented and grumbling spirit. The conditions :of the present war, the enforced idleness of the fleet, except for the inglorious and usually fatal submarine service, have had a particularly demoralising effect. What may have been the spark that fired the powder-cask is not yet clear. According to one report the officers, who had doubtless received from the Admiralty in Berlin a hint of what the terms of the armistice might be expected to entail for the navy, themselves prepared to rebel against Berlin orders and wanted to put to sea at last in order to seek a fight. The men, according to this account, refused to obey, hauled down the German war-flag on the battleship &quot;Kaiser,&quot; if not on other vessels, and hoisted the red flag of revolution. Officers are said to have been killed defending the standard against their own men. iThe Kiel Fjord is so narrow that a ship lying in it is never out of easy communication with the land. The revolt soon spread to the shipyards and workshops. Troops sent to quell it made common cause with the mutineers. After the Kussian model, a Council of Soldiers, Sailors, and Workmen was formed. Many of the workmen were armed, and a procession some 20,000 strong marched into the town, captured the barracks in the New Town, released the prisoners from the prison, hoisted the red flag .011 the City Hall, and, according to one account, shot the City Commandant, Captain Heine.These events seem to have taken place on the 4th and 5th November. On the 7th November the insurgents were still in possession of the town. But the movement is being taken in hand, as far as that may be still possible, by a deputation from the Government and the Reichstag, consisting of Haussman, the Wiirttemburg Kadical leader, now Secretary of State, and the Majority Socialist Noske, who were met at the railway station by the insurgents and escorted through the streets. Legien, the Socialist &quot;Reichstag Deputy for Kiel and President of the General Committee of Trade Unions, has also arrived, and will exercise his great influence on the side of order. There has been some loss of life, but in the course of the week it has become clear that the insurgents are not at this stage out for destruction or civil war, but rather wish to maintain their movement on disciplined lines of their own. So much, however, is clear. The command of the fleet, so far as Kiel is concerned, is in abeyance; the authority of the officers has been overthrown.What is more serious is that the insurrection has spread to Hamburg and Bremen, Xubeck, Warneintinde, Flensburg, and Appenrade, all ports within easy distance of Kiel by train, motor-car, or swift steam-launch. In Hamburg and Bremen the populace have the grievance that while the vast majority is social democratic and is so represented in the Reichstag, the Governments of these City States are republican oligarchies and in the hands of a very conservative patrician caste. In all these cases, however, the revolt seems to have been essentially military and naval, although it took place with the manifest sympathy and, in some cases, with the active co-operation of the populations.At Cologne, where there have been grave disturbances and some loss of life, the leaders, on the other hand, have been the workmen, and the movement assumed a pronounced anti-dynastic character. A museum was invaded, and pictures of the Kaiser and of,the Hohenzollern family were destroyed. There was a demonstration in favour of Liebknecht, and a resolution demanding the Kaiser&apos;s abdication &quot;within a fortnight&quot;
was passed. Troops which were called out refused to lire. Similar disturbances have been reported from Duisberg and Essen, but the Trade Union leaders, hitherto authoritative in such matters, have issued a proclamation against strikes in war industries.In Bavaria the demand for the abdication of the Kaiser is widespread. There is not the slightest evidence that it is encouraged from Government quarters, but it has been adopted by the Radicals and Moderate Liberals, as well as by the Socialists.The leaders of the Majority Socialist party in Berlin have now determined to insist upon abdication, and their attitude renders the issue almost a foregone conclusion. The Government cannot now exist without their support, and there is no loyal army to support a reactionary Federal Council or Chancellor who would face the country in the cause of the Hohenzollern dynasty. An attempt is, nevertheless, being made by General von Linsingen, Governor of Brandenburg, including Berlin, to prohibit by proclamation &quot; the formation of Soldiers&apos; and Workmen&apos;s Councils after the Russian pattern.&quot;It remains to be seen what authority will survive with sufficient strength to enforce the armistice terms, when, in obedience to the all but universal demand for immediate peace, these have to be accepted by the Government and the naval and military authorities.Meanwhile, the German Empire and Prussia are beginning to dissolve on- their periphery by the defection of those elements of the border nationalities which were only held in thrall by coercion. The Polish deputies from Posen and Silesia have seceded from the Reichstag and are endeavouring to make their way to Warsaw, although the Government is said to have refused them passports.Alsace-Lorraine has disappointed the hopes of the Chancellor, who, in his speech of the 22nd October, had announced the introduction of parliamentary government there, and had secured the appointment of a native, Herr Schwander, Burgomaster of Strass-burg, as Statthalter, and of a party leader, Herr Hauss, of the Catholic Centre, as Secretary of State. The parties, including the Centre, have nevertheless refused to have anything to do with this attempt to prejudge the national destinies of the provinces. The president of the Alsace Chamber, Herr Ricklin, who was regarded as a safe supporter of the scheme of an autonomous Alsace-Lorraine within the Empire, explained the position in the Reichstag on the 24th October: -&quot; We consider it our duty to tell the German people the whole truth, in order that no vain hopes may be indulged in. All that has now been undertaken in Berlin and by the new Government at Strassburg in this direction will, at the stage to which the question of Alsace-Lorraine has now reached, be unable to have any real effect on feeling there. The greater part of the population of Alsace-Lorraine claims the right to decide itself as to its political destiny. We must now refrain from anything that would prejudice the free expression of the will of the population. But the prescribed changes include such a prejudicing of the free expression of the will of the Alsace-Lorrainians that they are calculated to confuse public opinion. The mandate given to us by our electors to represent an independent federal State of Alsace-Lorraine has been cancelled by the development of this question. If the present step had taken place earlier, it would not only have saved us from a great deal of evil, but would have helped to prevent the ghastly misfortune that the war has brought upon the world.&quot;All this can mean nooning else than that the people of Alsace-Lorraine are prepared to return to the mother-country, France, on the earliest opportunity. The treatment they have received from the late Statthalter and the German military authorities during the war can only have confirmed their decision.The representative of North Schleswig in the Reichstag, Hanssen, has demanded the liberation of Germany&apos;s Danish subjects on the basis of clause 5 of the Treaty of Prague, which the Foreign Secretary. Dr. Solf, declared to have been cancelled by the agreement between Austria-Hungary and Germany in 1878. President Wilsoifs peace terms will hardly admit the relevancy of this plea.By way of compensation there seems to be a prospect of accretions on the south-eastern frontiers of Prussia, Saxony, and Bavaria. The Bohemian Germans and the Austrian Silesians have been declaring their desire to be incorporated in the Empire. While for the present the Executive Committee of the German-Bohemian National Assembly in Vienna (i.e., the German-Bohemian deputies from the Austrian Reichsrat) seems to - be gravitating towards the new State of German-Austria, another body calling itself the  &quot; Mandatories&quot; (&quot; Vertrauensmanner&quot;) of the German popular
Council of Bohemia, has met at Aussig and has declared itself in favour of the union of German Bohemia with the German Empire. At the same time it has addressed a resolution to the National Assembly of the German-Austrians in Vienna, whose first business it declares to be the establishment of constitutional union with the German Empire. It has also sent a telegram to the German Imperial Chancellor declaring that German Bohemia feels its destinies to be unalterably linked with those of the whole German people. It advocates the constitution of a province to be called German Bohemia.In the meantime, the Executive Committee of the National Assembly of German-Austrians in Vienna desires that &quot;German-Austria should be separately represented at the Peace Conference. It is to recommend that a German-Austrian note to that effect should be sent to President Wilson, and that German-Austria should claim the incorporation of the three and a-half million Germans of Bohemia, Moravia, and Austrian Silesia against the claims of the new Czech State.On Germany&apos;s north-western frontier a very important controversy has arisen with Holland, which has entered a protest against the dues which. Germany is levying upon passenger and goods traffic on the Rhine. The protest is based upon article 3 of the Rhine Navigation Acts of 1868. The question will undoubtedly interest the other Powers which are concerned in the freedom of inland navigation as secured by the Treaty of Vienna.
