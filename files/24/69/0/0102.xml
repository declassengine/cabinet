The German Government, on the other hand, are required formally to&quot;notify the Meutral countries of the world, and particularly Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Holland, that all restrictions placed on the trading of their vessels with the Allied and Associated countries, whether by the Gorman Government or by privato Gorman interests, are immediately cancelled.She Swedish Minister for Foreign Affairs has asked our Minister at Stockholm whether Swedish ships may henceforth call for inspection at Kirkwall or some other British port instead of at Halifax-.     Galling at Halifax involves a delay of 14 days on the round voyage.2. TRANSFER OF WEMY gOajjAGE,    Ihe Argentine Government have taken pos-session of the German ships In Argentine Ports.     The Argentine ]  -Minister of Marine has informed sir R. Towor that this action was taken in the interests of the Allies.   . We notod last week-that the German ships in the Dutch East Indies, in Chile and in Spain had -been taken over by the governments concerned.     In Spain a special Committee has assumed control of the German ships *    The Chilian Minister for Foreign Affairs has stated that tho Germat/ships in Chile have been seised in order to ensure their safety,, and that they will be held at the disposal of the Allies in view of the forthcoming poaoe- negotiations.    H.M. Ministers in Neutral countries-tries have been instructed to warn the Government to whioh they are accredited that H.M. Government will refuse to recognise any transfer of enemy tonnage to neutral flags or neutral ownershipwithout their consent before the fin 1 conclusion of Peace.

2.prefer a claim against the shipping of the Central Powers in compensation for ships sunk by Gorman submarines.    Under the Armistice no transfers of German merchant shipping of any description aro to take place before peace is signed and no ship is in tho meantime to be damaged or destroyed.BSI   SUPPLIES *     President Wilson has asked Mr. Hoover to proceed to Europe to assume control of the organisation of food relief for Belgium, Franca, ttoumania, Serbia and the liberated popu-lations of Austria.For this purpose it is important to bring into service as soon as possible the Auatro-Hungarian ships in Adriatic Ports and elsewhere.    H.M. Government have suggested that the Italian Gov-ernment should requisition the vessels in ports occupied by the Italian forces, and arrange with the Austrian shipowners who are accessible for the employment of their ships by the Italian Gov-emraent under the control of the Allied Maritime Transport Goun-oil.     The vessels would be regarded as held in trust pending the conclusion of peace and would bo used for conveying supplies to Austria Hungary and other countries under the control of the Allied Supply and Transport Association.    Applications for sup-plies from the several Governments of Austria Hungary would be considered by the Inter-Allied Food Gouncil in London, which will control all such purchases as may be necessary.jH* NETHERLANDS.     It was hoped that an Agreement would&apos; be reached with the Dutch delegates in London before the Armistice was signed. These negotiations cannot fail to be modified by the new conditional-ions, but an Agreement is still necessary,     The Associated Gov-ernments in return for supplying Holland with foodstuffs and raw materials will require full use to be made of the Dutch ships lying up in Dutch ports.    Our Minister at the Hague reports that
