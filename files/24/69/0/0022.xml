George Pew, JAP,:, president of the Hearts of Oat Society and one of our&apos;Parliamentary Agents, E an e [&quot;Some people seem to imagine that if you bring in a Bill it oan be amended afterwards.   That is not the proper ocurse. We ask you to see that we begin with a proper Bill, otherwise we would prefer to wait until such a Bill nan be prepared.&quot;I am further desired to being to your notice the view expressed on that occasion by the Chairman of the parliamentary Labour party (Rt.Hon,Wm,Ademson, J,;,P.) who, speaking for himself and for the Party, said:&quot;We are just as strong as you are on the necessity for the establishment of a Ministry of Health - a body that should have the utmost freedom of action and not be bound by the traditions and usages of any other body.   We, like you, want a Ministry of Health whish shall deal with public health free from the taint of pauperism and without association with the poor Law in any shapo or form.&quot;Representative as we are of a large proportion of the working classes of this Country, we beg that you will not permit I   the introduction either in this or any future Session, or parlia-1   ment, ef a measure which,    in its present form, cannot in any sense be regarded as agreed, and whose terms arc repugnant not only to ourselves and the Labour Party, but to other important seotions of the population, bb evidenced by comraunications which we understand have been addressed to yeu containing their views,I am also desired to say in conclusion that we yield to no one - and certainly - not to Industrial Assurance Companies - in our desire to improve the health of the nation, whether by the more consistent and drastic excroiso of the powers already possessed by Government departments, or by an extension of such powers through the medium of a&apos;Ministry of Health or otherwise.   As a matter of fact it is our advocacy during the past two year3 which has largely conduced to bring this question of a new-Ministry to the front.
*noNovember 5th, 1918.The Rt, Hon. J). Lloyd George, M,P.But in talcing our ntand against the association of the Miniotry of Hoalth with the non-msdical side of the p.-.or Law we know that the purity of our motives oanno^t be impugned, for our accredited loaders have no personal or political ends to serve: we are not oommeroial undertakings concerned with the earning of dividends for oharo-hciders, nor are,we&apos;possessed with the foar of attracting publio attention and criticism (as may be the oase with others) to any side of our w*rk.   It is due to our efforts for more than a century-past (as ysu yourself have stated) that the Nation has bocome more thrifty, more tt.elfVreliant and m::ro averse to subsistence on publio charity,   It is to these efforts that untold members have avoided falling by the way; and&quot; whilst wo have always (before, during and since the negotiations begun by $r..&apos; Addison; been both anxious and willing tc* aid in the reform of the Poor Law and in oomiring the inclusion within the Ministry of Health af the Medical and Imrtitu-tional care of tha Bick&apos;and infirm, we are not prepared to agree that the monetary rolietf-, employment,&apos; workhouse board and lodging of the able-bodied pauper, the no&apos;er-do-well and the tramp can cr shall be regarded as health work and included along with ourselves in such a Ministry, with the consequent tainting cf all our members (and the payments made to *diem as a reward fcr their ocntributione) with the public odium attaching to tho receipt of the pauper&apos;0 dole.In view of the extreme probability of an early appeal to the Electorate, and the urgent necessity of instructing our Societies and their members throughout the Country   as to the attitude to be adopted on this question towards the Candidates who will be seeking their suffrages, I shall be glad to receive your early assurance that before any legislation is initiated, in regard to a Ministry of Health, further and mere favourable consideration than has Mtherto been the oase shall be given to the representations of the Friendly Societies for the definite exclusion from the wcrk of such Ministry of the non-medical side of the Poor Lav;.Should the request already made to you on behalf of this Conference and other organisations in the Joint Committee of Approved Sooioties for an interview be conceded, we shall be pre-pared to put before you alternatives to the present plan of Dr. Addison, which, if not whelly meeting our views, would in our judgment be preferable to that now preposed6Wc observe from this moraing&quot;&apos;s Press the resignation of Mr. Hayes Fisher of the Presidency cf the Local Government Board.   We have always understood that ho was largely responsible for tho refusal t? agree a Bill in a form acceptable to Friendly Societies. We trust that with a change yf Ministers there may also ensue in this respect a Change ?f policy and a determination to maet in a sympathetic and practical way the contentions which have been placed before you by this and other organisations.I am, Sir,Your chedient Servant,TO. MARLOW,Secretary.
