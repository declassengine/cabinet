Owing, however, to a considerably larger tonnage being laid up for repairs than in the last few months, the British tonnage available for service was slightly less at the end than at the beginning of the month.

Italy.The Austrian Dreadnought Battleship &quot; Viribus Unitis &quot; was attacked and sunk on the morning of November 1st by two Italian Naval Officers, but no details are yet to hand as to how this operation was effected.Italian warships occupied the island of Lissa on November 2nd, and Italian Naval Forces entered Trieste on November 3rd.Rear Admiral A. Cerbino has succeeded Rear-Admiral Bonelli as Chief of the Staff to the Commander-in-Chief, Vice-Admiral Cusani-Visconti.
sAustria-Hungary.On October 31st the Austro-Hungarian Fleet, with the exception of the Danube monitors, passed into the possession of the Jugo-Slav National Council and hoisted the Croatian flag. The Danube monitors have been transferred to the Hungarian Government, but will presumably be handed over to the Allies in accordance with the terms of the armistice. The Austrian and Hungarian elements in the Fleet are being eliminated and guaranteed security until their departure.It is proposed that so soon as the Fleet can be moved it should proceed to Corfu to join the flag of the Allied Naval Commander-in-Chief at that base. Meanwhile a party of Jugo-Slav delegates were to embark on November 4th in a vessel flying the white flag, and to proceed to a rendezvous with a French torpedo boat which would conduct them to Corfu.it is not quite clear from the reports received who is the new Commander-in-Chief of the Jugo-Slavian Navy, as two names of comparatively junior officers have been mentioned in this respect, viz. : Captain Vukovitch de Podkapelski and Commander Method Koch, but it is possible that the former may intend to fill the post of Minister of Marine and the latter that of Commander-in-Chief of the sea-going fleet.It is reported that there are now no German submarines in Austrian harbours.Turkey.The armistice terms with Turkey include the surrender of all war vessels in Turkish waters.It is reported in this connection that the &quot; Sultan Selim &quot; (late &quot; Goeben &apos;) and four submarines are now in Turkish hands and will not operate against the Allies.Russia.Discontent has broken out among the Russian troops at Archangel. The principal causes of the trouble appear to have been that they were in receipt of poorer rations than other Allied troops, and that they were commanded by officers who were not truly Russian.It is proposed to try and rectify the former grievance, if sufficient rations can be spared and forwarded in time. As regards the latter, the Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs at Archangel attempts to justify the objection on the ground that several of the officers have taken part in political intrigues. Mr. Lindley has interviewed the Minister for Foreign Affairs and as a result the Russian General Samarin is to be dismissed, and General Ironside is to be consulted as to his successor. Colonel Durov, the Governor-General at Archangel, is to have nothing more to do with the army. No further trouble is anticipated.The Admiralty has been requested to get into touch with the Cossack General Denikin as soon as possible after the Allied Fleet enters the Black Sea. General DenikhVs headquarters are at Ekaterinodar in the North Caucasus, and he is believed to be in possession of the ports of Tuapse. Sukhuin and Novorossisk. A report from Nicolaiev states that Sevastopol will be closed by a minefield, owing to the clanger of the Entente Fleet penetrating the Black Sea.The Admiralty has now issued new orders to the Senior Naval Officer, Caspian, framed on a new policy arising from the altered military situation. It is now desired to retain such control of the Caspian as will enable us to prevent communication by. the enemy between its shores, and to assist any forces friendly to us. Armed ships are not to be sunk, and merchant ships are not to be captured unless they show distinct hostility to us. It is proposed that all ships manned by us should fly the White Ensign.All the Russian river gunboats in the Amur River are,, now manned by reliable Russian crews under a Japanese officer. They will remain in the river, but only four were in a fit state to steam at the time of reporting.Naval Staff.7 th November, 1918.[Appendix
