Thissrtv oV10194/18,MEMORANDUM BY THE CENTRAL CONTROL BOARD (LIQUOR TRAfffflO)Output of BeorAs desired by the War Cabinet, the Central Control Board (liquor Traffic) have considered the j^ood Controller&apos; s recommendation that the statutory barrelage of beer be increased by about 2,000,000 standard barrels as proposed in his Memorandum of the 12th instant (G.T. 6262).The Board have always understood that the restrictions upon the output of beer have been governed by considerations of food and tonnage, and they assume that the food and tonnage situation is now such as to make available the brewing materials which are required for the -proposed increase.Subject to the observations offered below, the Board do not anticipate that under present conditions this increase of barrelage would involve danger of an increase of insobriety.The Board   think, however, that the proposed increase should be deferred until the end of the acute stage of public excitement.The Board also think that, in allowing the proposed increase the Government should discourage any increase in the productionof the heaviest beers, and should take the opportunity of putting a stop to an excessive urine being charged for the lightest beers. It is understood that the Food Controller contemplates making regulations which will deal effectively with these points, and the Board would recommend that these regulations should come into force simultaneously with the proposed increase.There would be obvious objections on more grounds than one -to the utilisation of this increase for the manufacture of heavy beer of high alcoholic content, involving extravagant use of materials.November 14th, 1918,
