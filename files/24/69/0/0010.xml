J.THIS DOCU^MT IS TH3 PROPERTY (F HIS BRITANIIIC MAJESTY !S GOv&amp;U*k^T.)W A R   0 A B I NET.xulSROHAM1 SHIPBUILDING POSITION.Memorandum by the Controller General of Merchant.Shipbuilding,With reference to my report of the 3rd September last; x -ttrrttugments have already been made, which if carried out, will gradually&apos; give us the men we can reasonably expect to draw from Naval construction,&apos; and by these arrangements we anticipate that 25,000 men will &quot;be set free by the end of March 1919.     It is recognised that this transfer will mean an addition to the number of men at present engaged on Merchant Shipbuilding, but I am of opinion that the time has nor; arrived when effect should also be given to the second recommendation contained in my report, viz.-&quot;Arrangements should be made for the immediate release, for Merchant Shipbuilding, of all Ship-yard ,/orkers - without exception or qualification -at present frith the Navy, Army, Royal Air Force, or other Government employment, and that these workers be returned to the districts in which their homes are situated, as far as possible.Host of the men hitherto released have been of low category, and from Home Service units, and present instructions leave it entirely in the discretion of the Army Council or the Admiralty Board whether or not a man is to be released,   For this reason it appears to me that the 7/ar Cabinet must instruct that Shipyard workers are to be sent forthwith to work in Shipyards, irrespective of the claims of any other service to them.Unless these instructions are issued I shall not be able to obtain the 75,000 additional men who are essential to produce the maximum output of 3,000,000 tons of Merchant Shipping per annum,.(Sd.) PIRRIE.Controller General ofMerchant Shipbui1di ng.SECRET., -&apos;-........-&quot;&quot;i &quot; r.....G.T.6210.4th November, 1910.
