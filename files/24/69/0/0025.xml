Chamberlain. &apos;   T^P &quot;aotlgj^ r onulreTTr)&quot;&apos;By War Cabinet 4-78, Minute 6, I was asked to assemblea Committee to examine what improvements could be made in theNaval. Military and Air Force Reports from the point of view of propaganda.The Committee was to consist of representatives of&apos; the Admiralty, V.7ar Office, Air Ministry and the &quot;Ministry of Information.I regret that Lord Beaver-brook&apos;s illness deprived us of the advantages of his experience.   In his absence the Ministry was represented by Colonel Buchan.As a result of the CommitteeTs deliberations the following arrangements have been or will be made.ARMY.        (l)   C.H.Q. Franco will in cases where individ-ual act3 of gallantry are confirmed by subscouent oneuiry take steps to give names and details to the accredited press corres-coorespondents.(2)   Arrangements have been made whereby corres-coorespondents attached to the various Dominion Forces shall also report the doings of the British troops.Y(5)   The War Office have impressed on G.H.Q.. the importance of issuing supplementary telegraphic despatches mentioning the divisions and other formations by name and giving an account of their operations,AIR FORCE..        An Officer will be attached to General Salmond^e Headquarters to collect details of individual acts of gallantry and the names and the counties to which the air-men belong&apos;will be published.   It is hoped that this will identify the exploits with the British Air Force and attract attention in the neighbourhoods concerned.   The Minister for Air is advised that to publish the actual names of airmen whoso doings are chronicled would give rise to general dis-satisfaction in the- Air Force owing to the fact that so many members of the Forco are engaged on arduous daily work re-quiring continual courage and endurance without the oppor^ tunity for conspicuous notice.NAVY.. The Admiralty are prepared to take actionon similar lines to that agreed upon by the Far Office and Air Board.The MINISTRY of INFORMATION are satisfied with the arrange-merits proposed.(Initialled)     A.C,2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 8th November, 1918,
