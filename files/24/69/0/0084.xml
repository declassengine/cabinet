&apos; &apos; PRICES FOR 191 fi CROSSc...r       ________.......__________J22,Memorandum   by   the   Food   controller the memorandum on cereal prices for the 1919 crop, which was sent to the War Cabinet as a memorandum agreod with the Agricultural Departments, has been referred back for further consideration, in view of the objection subsequently taken to it by l&apos;.r.. Prothero, who desires that the announcement, instead of dealing with maximum prices, should guarantee to the farmer fixed prices not below the prices ruling for tho present crop.The matter has been further considered in tho Ministry of Food, and the following observations are submittod on Llr, Prothero&apos;s proposal ,t(1) The question of guaranteeing price? for the 1919 crop is one with which the Food Controller   is now not vitally concerned.   There poems no doubt that sufficient supplies of food for this country during the cereal year 1919-20 can be obtained by importation even if the &quot;home crop declines,   Tho question of the extent to which, and the means by which, agricultural production in this country should bo maintained by a system of guarantees, is one of general agricultural policy.(2) There are distinct Parliamentary and administrative difficulties in giving any guarantee of prices in excess of those contained in the Corn Production Act by an immediate Government announcement.   That Act embodies a Parliamentary bargain concerning wages as well as price. There aro no doubt good reasons&quot;for suggesting a revision of the bargain, but this should be done by Parliamentary and not by administrative action. It should also be pointed out that any guarantee for the 1919 crop involves administrative action continuing till the latter part of 1920, when it is quite possible that the Ministry of Food may not bo in existence,, .        the(3) While/objections to giving any guarantee now are thus very considerable, I venture to question whether the advantages   to be derived from it are great.   It is extremely doubtful whether the farmers7 minds will be moved by it one way or another.   They will probably continue to sow for next year in anticipation of something like the prices that they have been getting In the present year.   I do not doubt that, if in fact prices fall very considerably, it may be necessary for the Government next year to take some artificial means of maintaining th^m, if it does not wish to risk a serious diminution in sowing for the 1920 crop. Action on thea* lineSi   however, could perfectly well bo taken with full Parliamentary sanction uft*r the end of the present calendar year*Whilef therefore, I recognise that tho question of guaranteeing prices for the cereal crops of 1919 is not mainly a question for&apos; the Food Controller and therefore do not wish to presp my view strongly. I am of opinion that tho Government should consider the matter very carefully before committing themselves to any form of guarantee at the present juncture..I  .may add, that as Food Controller I am naturally directly concerned in securing that the price of bread does not rise above tho prerent price of 9d. per quartern loaf which corresponds to a v/hout price of approximately 64/- per quarter of 504 lbs. (English Wheat)... So long as the price of -wheat oxceeds this, it will be necesrary to&quot; maintain the broad subsidy,I have dealt above only with cereals.   In the case of potatoes as-, at present advised, I contemplate taking no action to guarantee either a price or a markot for the next crop, though I should be prepared to consider, if this is thought desirable, making an announcement that . if any maximum prices thould be fixed, they -would not be fixed bolov a specified, figure,J.
