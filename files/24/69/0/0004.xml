(War Cabinet 488, Minute 8, and 489, Minute 2.) Report by Mr. Chamberlain. I.THIS Committee has held three meetings. It has been found impossible to reconcile the differences of opinion which exist among its members. I received authority from the Cabinet in that event to give a decision on their behalf; but such, large questions of policy are involved that I feel bound to take the opinion of the Cabinet on the subject.All the members of the Committee agreed on a certain number of general propositions. It is not necessary for me to recite them all, but the following should be before the Cabinet.They agreed-(1.) that for the purpose of our enquiry surplus stores must be held to consist of such stores as are declared to be surplus by the Government Depart-ments in whom they are vested. They must also include goods of every description in process of manufacture for the Government whatever the stage which they have reached, if these are not required by the Depart-ment for which they were being made.(2.) that it is impossible to decide how to deal with manufactured or half-manufactured articles without knowing what policy is being pursued in regard to the finished articles returned into stock by the Naval of( Military Authorities; that similarly it is impossible to lay down rules for the disposal of the returned goods without at the same time&apos; deciding what policy should be pursued in regard to the raw materials and the half-finished goods.(3.) that in all plans for the disposal of such stores a vital consideration must be the preservation of the recuperative power of the country.(4.) that owing to the varied and complicated character of the contracts exist-ing between the Ministry of Munitions and the factories, no central authority could make the required arrangements for the stores in process of manufacture by or for that Ministry, except through the machinery of the Ministry.It was further agreed (5.) that the present organisation, consisting of a Central Advisory Council without executive powers and an Executive Board whose relations to* one another are not clearly defined, neither of which can exercise any authority over the different Departments concerned, is unworkable.(6.) that any central authority entrusted with the task of dealing with surplus stores, must act under the direct supervision of a Minister of the Crown, and must be given executive authority, and that its directions must be followed by the Departments.[985] . .
This statement of some of the conditions of the problem was unanimously accepted. There was no agreement as to the inferences which were to be drawn from them. Half the dommittee was of opinion that some central authority should be charged with the duty of ordering and directing the disposal of all surplus stores, and that no Department should act until after it had received instructions from this central authority and then only subject to the instructions so received. The either half of the Committee was of opinion that the primary responsibility for the disposal of stores should rest with the Departments and that the initative should be theirs, a central authority only intervening through a Committee of representa-tives of the different Departments to co-ordinate their action, and through a Member of the War Cabinet to decide if in any case they were unable to arrive at an agree-ment. The President of the Board of Trade, the First Commissioner of Works, the representatives of the Treasury and the Admiralty and I were in favour of the latter proposal. Lord Salisbury, the Minister of Munitions, the Minister of Reconstruc-tion, the Minister for Air, and the representative of the War Office, were in favour of the former proposal, but they were not entirely agreed as to what that central authority should be.III.After carefully considering all the arguments, I am convinced that the immediate establishment of a&apos; new central authority is impracticable. Having regard to the intricacy of the arrangements in which the Ministry of Munitions is involved, and to the very wide field over which their activities extend, I have come to the conclusion that if a single central authority were immediately boi be created it could only be that Department. But I am equally convinced that that Department is not at present equipped to deal with certain large classes of stores. Taking the Government machinery, therefore, as it now exists, I should recommend (1.) that each Department should be held responsible for declaring what portion of its own stocks are surplus stores.(2.) that such surplus stores should then be held to the order of the Depart-ment whose business it has been to supply them, and that the Department which has supplied them should be made responsible for their disposal. But I should add (3.) that the civilian controls of the War Office should be transferred as soon as possible after the cessation of war to the Board of Trade, except in the case of foodstuffs where they should vest in the Food Controller.In order to secure unity of policy throughout, it would be necessary to organise under a single Minister a Committee of the departmental Ministers who would dis-cuss and settle broad lines of policy, subject to the approval of the Cabinet where such was required. They would probably find it convenient to establish an inter-departmental committee of officials on whom would devolve the settlement of all but the largest questions.IV.I have proceeded so far upon the assumption ,that the problem is to be resolved through the present machinery of Government. It has, however, been proposed, and General Smuts&apos; Committee has decided to recommend to the Government, that a Ministry of Supply should be created. If this decision is approved by the Cabinet, it would naturally affect their decision on the question of the disposal of surplus stores. In that case, the present Ministry of Munitions would naturally become the nucleus of the new Ministry of Supply, and just in proportion as it was able to organise itself for the purposes of supply it should take over the work of disposal. The Minister of Supply would then, as I conceive it, have two principal Directors working under him a Director of Purchase and a Director of Sales. A strong financial organisation probably under a third Director would be necessary.If a scheme on these lines be approved and gradually worked up to, it would, I think, be natural that the Minister of Munitions should be Chairman of the Com-mittee of Ministers, since one must conceive of the Minister of Munitions as be-coming the future Minister of Supply just as the Ministry of Munitions would become the Ministry of Supply.
(G.T.-6204A.)Report by Mr. Chamberlain, G.T.-6204. Supplementary Note.Since writing my Report to the Cabinet on the Disposal of Surplus Stores, my attention has been called to the fact that the wording of the Memorandum would not provide for the complete concentration for the purposes of disposal of all stores of each class in the hands of a single authority. For example, it is suggested to me that the Admiralty has made direct purchases of motor vehicles and of shells. It will, I think, be apparent that in such cases what has hitherto been the main source of supply should become the sole source of disposal. The comparatively small number of motor vehicles which the Admiralty would have for disposal should, therefore, according to my principles, be handed over to the Ministry of Munitions* Since this was written a more complete scheme on those lines has been approved by the Economic Defence and Development Committee for submission to the Cabinet.I have so far dealt with the whole problem as if it could be considered as a purely national one, but whoever is charged with the disposal of supplies, whether it be one Department or many, will require clear guidance as to the extent of our obligations to our Allies. Can they, for instance, treat timber in the possession of the British armies in France and Belgium, whether cut from French forests, cap-tured from the Germans, or brought by us from overseas, as being stores of which they can dispose in the exclusive interest of this country ? I conceive that this would be clearly impossible and that it will be necessary during the period of transition that the Inter-Ally arrangements for the allocation of materials of which we all have need, should be continued. I therefore suggest that the Allied Governments should be invited&apos; to instruct their representatives on the Programme Committees, working as now under the supervision of the Inter-Ally Maritime Transport Council, to formulate post-war programmes on the same lines as they formulate the present war programmes, and that if this be accepted, account should be taken of their recommendations in the disposal of surplus stores. *Many other points will occur to members of the Cabinet, such as the method of ascertaining the requirements of the Dominions and Dependencies of the Crown, of public authorities in the United Kingdom, and of the different Government Depart-ments themselves, some of which might have a use for stores which were surplus to the requirements of the Department in whose hands they were. But these questions will, I think, best be decided after the decision has been given upon the main point. If a Ministry of Supply is to be created, it must, as I have said, be developed out of the Ministry of Munitions. In that case, therefore, I should charge the Minister of Munitions with the task of framing, for the approval of the Cabinet, the exact machinery by which its decisions would be brought into force, and the requisite knowledge obtained. If, on the other hand, the Cabinet decided against the creation of a Ministry of Supply, the duty should at once be devolved upon some member of the War Cabinet acting in consultation with the Departments concerned. In either case, close co-operation will be necessary between the different Ministers concerned, and everything will depend upon the cordiality of their co-operation and readiness of their Departmental officers to look beyond the narrow interests of their Depart-ment to the wider interest of the State. In either case, also, the work already done by Lord Salisbury&apos;s Advisory Council and the Executive Board will be of great assistance to the responsible Minister, who may be glad to avail himself of their assistance in the new organisation.(Initialled)        A.

which has supplied the great bulk of motor vehicles required by the different Govern-ment Departments. The same principle would apply to the surplus stocks of naval ammunition, whether complete or in process of manufacture.Again, nothing in my Beport should be held to preclude arrangements being made for the transfer from one Department to another of stocks which the first Department has ceased to require, and in which the second Department is still dealing. An example might be found in the case of building materials.These are minor questions which should be capable of friendly adjustment be-tween the Departments concerned, or, failing agreement among them, of decision by the Member of the War Cabinet or Minister of Munitions (acting as future Minister of Supply) as the case may be.(Initialled)       X.
