&apos;iim(MINISTRY  OP  FOOD.Report for Week ending Wednesday, November 6, 1918,PART I.-ACTION  TAKEN.Mr. Clynes presided over two meetings of the Food Council held during the past week. A memorandum on measures for utilising present surplus supplies of home-grown cattle was considered. It was decided to proceed as far as possible with proposals for consumption of fresh meat by the Army, chilling and freezing, ship-ments .of dead meat to France, and salting. It was agreed that arrangements for tinning meat should be. proceeded with until further notice but not beyond December.It was decided that all proposals for the export of potatoes and other food (except to the British Army) must be brought before the Food Council for approval.The following joint recommendation by the representatives of . the Allied Maritime Transport Council and the Inter-Allied Food Council was read by Sir John Beale : -&quot;It is recommended that the merchant marine of the Central Powers should be placed under the directions of the Allied Maritime Transport Council; and that such supplies of food or other commodities as may be allowed to the Central Powers shall be obtained through the instrumentality of the existing Allied organisations, and under such terms and conditions as those organisations may be required to impose.&quot;It was agreed not to press the United States Food Administration to adopt a policy of conservation to provide supplies of butter and cheese for the United Kingdom.A memorandum by Mr. Beveridge setting out an emergency scheme prepared by the Home Supplies Board for the release of a certain proportion of the barley crop for feeding-stuffs was generally approved. It was decided that Mr. Wise should inform the Central Agricultural Advisory Council of the scheme and should obtain the approval of the Board of Agriculture.Committee of Representatives. The Committee of Representatives have been devoting considerable attention to the needs of the recovered territories in France, Belgium, and Italy as well as Serbia, and large allocations of food-stuffs, principally flour, have been arranged for.The Imports Board. It was reported that the United Kingdom was faced with an increase in the price of beef, and that of inferior quality, for November in order to facilitate the reduction of the price of hides in the United States, and also that the price in October had not been lowered. It was agreed to cable, making strong representations on the matter.It was agreed to cable to the Canada Food Board to the effect that the Ministry were relying on 3,000 tons of butter from them, 2,500 of this amount before Christmas, and requesting that if this quantity could not be positively assured they would make up the amount from stocks in cold storage.A report was made to the Board on the increasing demand for food in the territories which were being liberated.It was agreed that the Treasury should be asked to sanction the purchase of 25^000 tons of Norwegian fresh herrings in the beginning of next year without interference with private import.The programme for January to March 1919 was discussed. The tea figure was agreed at 38,000 tons, but it was pointed out that arrivals up to September had been below estimate, and that it might be necessary to ask for an increased allocation for tea when the figures were revised in the light of September to December arrivals.It was reported that the Coal Controller had agreed to release for export to Egypt 20,000 tons of coal in exchange for 40,000 tons of cattle cake.a  (33)6822-1   Pk 1   140  11/18  E &amp; S A.L
The Rome Supplies Board. An emergency scheme for the immediate release of a proportion of the barley crop, ponding a further arrangement for bringing barley into the scheme for rationing feeding-stuffs was considered. The following points to be embodied in a statement for the Food Council were agreed : (1) That out of each thresh a farmer shall be required to sell not less than 80 per cent, to a maltster or other licensed manufacturer, or to a recognised grain dealer (or feeding-stuffs dealer).(2) That after selling this amount the farmer may apply to the grain oilicer for a permit to use 20 per cent, of the thresh for feeding to his stock, This permit will be given by the grain officer on the production of evidence that 80 per cent, of the thresh has been sold.(3) Damaged and tail grain is to be included in the 20 per cent, used for feeding-stuffs.(4) Barley suitable for malting may be sold to a maltster at 3s. per quarter more than the prices permitted in the Grain (Prices) Order, 1918.(5) When arrangements have been made for linking up the distribution of barley with the Feeding-stuffs Distribution Scheme, the amount of barley used must be accounted for as against offals in the ration in the proportion of one ton of barley for one ton of offals.(6) In cases where a farmer sells more than 80 per cent, of his thresh he may be allowed to carry forward as credit any amount of the 20 per cent, permitted on the thresh which he has not in fact used, to be brought into account later on.Central Agricultural Advisory Council. At a meeting held on Tuesday, November 5, the following resolutions were passed : &quot; (1) That in view of the extreme gravity of the agricultural position in the United Kingdom, arising from the present and prospective shortage of concentrated feeding-stuffs for farm animals, it is imperative that absolute priority should forthwith be given for such feeding-stuffs and for the raw material for their manufacture over all other commodities in respect of shipping tonnage now being rendered available as the result of the cessation of submarine activities, and that the Ministry of Food and the Board of Agriculture be and are hereby asked to convey from this Council to the War Cabinet and the Allied Maritime Transport Council a request to this effect.&quot;&quot; (2) That a Sub-Committee of this Council be appointed to meet with the Army Council Representatives with a view to getting the Hay and Straw Forage Orders amended and corrected so as to deal only with the forage which the Army Council actually require, leaving the remainder of the forage free to farmers to deal with within maximum prices.&quot;Approval was expressed of the steps which have been taken to ensure that fat cattle from grass districts be taken for consumption before those from arable districts by closing the markets in the arable districts for a short period.The Council also approved the suggested scheme for the use of barley for feeding stock, and urged that the barley re-sold to farmers for feeding purposes should not be adulterated with other ingredients, and that the price of malting barley should be made somewhat higher than that of milling barley.Consumers1 Council. Mr. Clynes and Major Astor were present at the meeting of this Council on Wednesday, November 7.It was resolved that while the ,services of Mr. Reginald Butler were not essential to the effective control of milk distribution, the Council favoured his employment under a definite contract of service and on the financial terms already approved by the Financial Advisory Committee.It was explained that further investigation justified a price of h\d. for fresh eggs during the winter, and this price was accordingly recommended for adoption.The Council were unable to favour the compulsory use of potatoes in bread, but refrained from opposing the draft Order.The position of the American Meat Trust in regard to the Ministry was discussed. Mr.&apos; Wise stated exactly what the position was, and explained that this country really could not of itself do much in the matter, except to make representations, but the
United States Government were certainly alive to the matter and were taking steps to minimise5 the power of, and dangers arising from, the Trust.Mr. Hyndman said he would move a resolution on the subject at an early date.Meat Supplies.The difficulty of dealing with the quantities of live stock which are still coming forward continues to be the chief problem. At the same time the position is further complicated by the strain put upon transport facilities so as to supply the whole of the London area with home-grown meat. The position in this respect became so acute at one time last week that it was found necessary to utilise the whole of the home-killed meat which had been frozen and put into London stores.Arrangements have been made for a further number of slaughtermen to be released from the army, and up to the present about 150 have been furnished from this source. Even this number falls short of requirements, and, consequently, the need still exists for cattle to be held back on farms to a very great extent. The number of beasts slaughtered last week for the army was approximately 4,300, and for the navy about 500, while the present stocks of home-killed.meat, frozen and put into store, are approximately 1,200 tons, All the arrivals of imported meat are, therefore, building up reserve stocks for both military and civil requirements. These stocks have already reached fair dimensions, and before the end of the year the pressure on cold storage space will be extremely severe.Arrangements have been made for pickling horseflesh for export to Belgium for the relief of the liberated population. Experiments are also being made in the direction of salting down home-killed, beef on a large scale.In the House of Commons on 6th November, Mr. dynes stated that, on the advice of a special committee appointed by the Central Agricultural Advisory Council, and in order to deal with the present heavy surplus of cattle from grazing districts, he had decided that supplies should first be taken from such districts, and that in arable districts the markets should be closed for local supplies. This arrangement would involve the closing of markets in Leicestershire for a short time, during which local supplies would be obtained from the adjoining grazing counties.Markets are also being closed to local supplies throughout the counties of Norfolk, Suffolk, Cambridgeshire, Bedfordshire, Essex, Middlesex, Herts, Wilts, Hants, Berks, and Oxon. The closing of these markets was made necessary by the fact that there is a surplus of approximately 18,000 beasts a week in grazing districts.Asked if the trouble were not due to the fact that after the experience of last year nothing was done to increase the supply of feeding-stuffs, Mr. Clynes replied that it was simply due to the war.Organised Distribution.Tea Distribution Scheme. The system of distribution of tea supplies which came into force on the 13th July for a period of twenty-four weeks, is being extended for a further period of four weeks, up to the 25th of January 1919.Existing authorities for retailers and caterers to purchase supplies of tea, will remain valid until the 25th of January, but the public are required not later than the 10th of November to renew their registration with their present tea retailers,&apos; by lodging with them a counterfoil from the new Ration Book.As from the 26th of January supplies of tea to retailers will be adjusted in accordance with any change in the number of duly registered customers, occurring as the result of such re-registration.Certain modifications will be made in the existing allowances of tea to catering and other establishments.A new system of distribution will be brought into operation containing modifica-tions of the existing Scheme, which experience has shown to be necessary. The basis of distribution to consumers, i.e., 2 ozs. per head will, however, remain unchanged.Bacon Distribution. The scheme of distribution continues to work satisfactorily, and, so far, the allotment of 60 per cent, of the applications appears to be sufficient for all requirements. Stocks are smaller, and, although there is still a strong pre-judice against the fat backs and bellies which form such a large percentage of the assortment available for distribution, the position is steadily becoming clearer, and will probably be quite satisfactory towards the end of the year, when a larger stock of Wiltshire and Cumberland sides is expected to arrive.
Divisional Reports. Very little frozen meat is being issued at the present time owing to the abundance of fresh meat coming into the markets.It is noted by the Commissioner for the London division that there is a large increase in the demand for &quot;Travellers Ration Books.&quot; It would appear that a practice is growing up of certain members of the public obtaining &quot; Traveller&apos;? Ration Books &quot; to which they are not entitled in order to avoid being tied to a particular retailer for butter, meat, &amp;c.In the past week a -glut of lish occurred in the market at FleetWood.   400 boxes(approximately 25 tons) of small fish.....-whiting and dabs remained unpurchased.Prompt action was taken by the Divisional Commissioners fish officer, who despatched a consignment of 10-stone boxes to each of 27 industrial areas. The fish were retailed at from t\d. to o\d. a lb. Thanks were due, it is noted, to the trawler owners for their ready co-operation in carrying out the scheme, which enabled consumers to obtain excellent fish at reasonable rates, in areas where it was most acceptable. From reports received, the experiment proved an unqualified success, and is likely to be repeated when occasion arises.Orders under Defence of the Realm Regulations.1. Order, dated 31st October, 1918, amending the Bacon, Ham, and Lard (Prices) Order, 1918, provides a revised schedule of retail prices, applicable only to sales by retail in Scotland, and adapted to the special conditions of the Scottish trade. The wholesale prices are adjusted to correspond with the retail prices.2. Order amending the Live Stock (Sales) Order, 1918, dated 1st November, 1918, increases till the end of January-the price of cattle ami sheep in accordance with the promise already made to the farmers. The increase in the price of sheep averages Is. per sheep as from November 1st, the alteration in cattle prices dates from 1st December.   Further provision will be made for prices after January.3. The Barley (Restriction) (Ireland) Order, 1918, dated 1st November, 1918, restricts, except under licence, the movement of barley from one part of Ireland to another. It also prohibits, except under licence, the grinding, crushing, or other treatment of barley in any mill in Ireland.4. The Damaged Foodstuffs Order, 1918, dated 1st November, 1918, deals with certain articles of food condemned or unfit for human consumption. The Order forbids anyone to destroy such food-stuffs, or to dispose of them to any person other than the local authority. It prohibits anyone other than a sanitary authority, except under licence, from purchasing them. The National Salvage Council has power to give directions as to their disposal. The Order does not apply to the Admiralty, Army Council, or Air Council.5. The Irish Returns Order, 1918, dated 4th November, 1918, provides that returns shall be made of all traffic in certain food-stuffs between Great Britain and Ireland. The returns will be made to the Irish Department of Agriculture.6. An Order dated 5th November, 1918, postpones the date on which the Voluntary Kitchens (Licensing) Order, 1918, comes into force until 1st January 1919.7. The Cheese (Export from Ireland) Order, 1918, dated 5th November, 1918, prohibits the export of cheese from Ireland after November 8th, except under licence.8. The Milk (Prohibition of Export) (Ireland) Order, 1918, dated 5th November, 1918, prohibits from the 8th November, except under licence, the export from Ireland of milk, cream, buttermilk, separated milk, and skimmed milk.Enforcement of Orders.There are 85 fewer cases recorded this week than last.

PART II.-SUMMARY OF THE FOOD POSITION.Imports.The total imports of the principal food and feeding-stuffs in the week ended 2nd November (245,000 tons) showed a marked improvement on those of recent weeks. They are not only higher than those of the previous week (196,200 tons) but of any week since June.The improvement is due mainly to the increased import of wheat, the amount of wheat and flour as equivalent grain rising by 48,100 tons to 160,900 tons the highest import since July 1917. Tea imports were heavy (10,700 tons) being the highest weekly import, with one exception, during the past two years.Improved imports were shown in barley, oats, and maize (5,300 tons increase), beef and mutton (6,500 tons increase), bacon (3,700 tons increase), and cheese (2,600 tons increase). Rice, the imports of which had been extremely small for eight weeks past, arrived to the extent of 2,000 tons. Meat uuenumerated (1,700 tons decrease) fell to a quantity (3,000 tons) more nearly approaching the average. The heaviest fall occurred in sugar, namely, from 39,600 tons to 9,700 tons.The total imports for the first nine weeks of the cereal years 1917-18 and 1918-19 are compared in the following table : Imports in the first 9 weeks of cereal year..-	1 1917.	1918.

The improvement in the wheat supplies relates not only to the quantity imported but also to the relative proportion of flour to whole grain with the resulting availability of grain offals. The ratio of flour to grain in the cereal year 1917-18 was as 5 is to 7 ; whereas in the current cereal year the ratio has been as 1 is to 10, the ratio in the week ended 2nd November &apos;being as low as 1 to 30.1   Consumption.Meat. The number of cattle accepted for slaughter in Great Britain in the week ended 26th October rose by about 5,000 to 50,000. Of this total, 3,800 were taken for the Army, and 500 tons of beef (representing about 2,000 head of cattle) were put in cold storage. On the other hand, about 500 tons of home-fed meat were withdrawn from cold storage to meet the needs of the metropolitaa area, so that the net supply of home-fed beef for civilians was estimated at 11,500 tons.   The estimated total suppliesa   6822-1 BA series of summonses against J. H. Siddell, grocer, of Nuneaton, revealed systematic profiteering. Commodities such as jam, tea, lard, ham, condensed milk and marmalade, were all proved to have been sold at excess prices, and false infor-mation respecting the purchase and stocks of tea had been given. The defendant had also exceeded the supply of fats to which he was entitled by 1,306 lbs., between July and October.   The defendant was fined 125 . and $11, costs.
of home-fed butchers&apos; meat were nearly 17,000 tons; there were also issued 900 tons of imported refrigerated meat, the condition of most of which made its further retention in stock inadvisable. Total supplies were thus about 17,900 tons, which represents, after allowance for butchers&apos; waste and the higher coupon value of offals, approximately 1(5,200 tons, as against ration requirements of 15,000 tons.Bacon. The index numbers indicating the variations in the sales of provisions by a large number of multiple shops and co-operative societies for four weeks ended 26th October, are given in Table 0 (3). With the exception of cheese, the larger distribution of which in September is reflected in the October sales, the numbers show a general decline on the preceding four weeks. Issues of bacon (Table B 1) have been heavily reduced in answer to reduced demand, but while wholesalers have apparently succeeded in reducing their stocks, retailers find more difficulty in disposing of the present quality. The reduction in butter (14 per cent.) reflects the reduction of issues in accordance with the fixed proportion of butter in the butter-margarine ration.Stocks.Stocks generally were enlarged during the week ended 26th October-beef and mutton by 6,200 tons, canned meat by 2,700 tons, and cheese by 900 tons. Bacon stocks were reduced by a further 3,400 tons. In view of the placing of certain quantities of home-killed meat in cold store, the returns now show the stocks of home-killed and foreign meat separately. The amount of home-killed meat returned on the 26th October was 1,500 tons. Jam and honey have also been added to the returns  the total stocks being shown as 1,700 tons and 500 tons respectively.
