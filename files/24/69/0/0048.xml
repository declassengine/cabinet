ELECTRICITY SUPPLY.

G.T.6248

Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.

Early last year I received representations from the Electrical Trades Committee strongly urging that some steps should be taken to remove the present difficulties in regard to electricity supply, to prepare for the great expansion which must inevitably take place after the war, and to meet in the best way possible the arrears now being accumulated in many districts.

Similar representations were made by the Coal Conservation Sub-Committee of the Reconstruction Committee.

I accordingly appointed a Committee (the Electric Power Supply Committee) to consider and report what steps should be taken, whether by legislation or otherwise, to ensure that there shall be an adequate and economical supply of electric power for all classes of consumers in the United Kingdom, particularly industries which depend upon a cheap supply of power for their development.

This Committee which was thoroughly representative of the various interests concerned made a unanimous report, after taking evidence from the various representative associations throughout the Country. Copies of this Report are appended. The Committee recommended:-

That a body of Electricity Commissioners should be set up to whom should be transferred to existing powers of the Board of Trade and other Government Departments relative to the supply of electricity, and who should, subject to an appeal to Parliament in certain cases, have general control over the generation and distribution of electricity in the United Kingdom.

That in the place of existing small areas the United Kingdom should be divided by the Electricity Commissioners, after local enquiries, into large districts technically suitable for the economical generation and distribution of electricity, and

That each district should be administered by a District Board, representative of the interests concerned, who should be responsible for the generation of electricity and its supply to distributors.

The constitution and areas of the District Boards are to be settled by Provisional Orders confirmed by Parliament.

A Bill has been prepared to give general effect to the recommendations of the Committee.

The Bill provides that the Board of Trade may, through the Commissioners, exercise any of their powers under the existing Electricity Acts, and defines the respective jurisdiction and functions of the Board of Trade and of the Commissioners in regard to the proposed District Boards and existing supply authorities.

(1)
The scheme proposed in the Bill is to give the Commissioners general control over the District Boards, while the Board of Trade would have the ultimate control of policy, the duty of promoting legislation, controlling the raising of loans end issue of stock by the District Boards, and approving expenditure by the Commissioners.

The necessity for dealing with the question is very urgent. Existing generating stations are over-loadad and urgent developments are being held up. The demand for electric power increases day by day to meet present needs, and under existing circumstances this can only be met by a hand to mouth policy involving the extension of the present system of uneconomical generating stations and a consequent great waste of capital.

The demands which will arise to meet the requirements for industrial purposes immediately after the war will be enormously greater, and it will be fatal to the ultimate proper economic development of industry in this country if extensions of electric power supply are not carried out on a systematic and wider basis, especially having regard to the great electrical developments in other countries, particularly those enjoying the benefit of large sources of water power.

The increasing development of electric furnaces and other applications to industry; the annual saving of many millions of tons of coal the probable electrification of some of the railways (for which the present time is especially favourable seeing that their steam locomotives and rolling stock have been so depleted for war purposes): in addition to the large accumulation of arrears in electrical plant extensions throughout the country are all factors which make this matter one of extreme urgency from a national point of view.

If th? necessary legislation could have been passed during the present Session steps for the appointing of the commissioners, districting of the country, holding enquiries and preparing schemes for setting up District Boards, at least in the principal industrial districts, could have been prepared next year for submission to Parliament in the Session of 1919-20. I recognise, however, that this is probably impossible, but I wish to point out that if legislation must be postponed till next Session, such schemes cannot ? submitted to Parliament before the Session of 1920-21. A great amount of work will still be necessary after the schemes have been sanctioned by Parliament, before they can be brought into effective practical operation. Thus, unless in some way we can shorten the period of preparation we shall lose the years which are vital for the resuscitation and development of industries after the war. In these circumstances any saving of time is of the utmost importance.

If therefore as I fear the Parliamentary situation precludes the possibility of the necessary legislation being passed this Session I propose, in anticipation of 4 it. to appoint three Cojnmissibners (of the five to be ultimately appointed as recommended by the Electric Power Supply Committee) who would proceed at once to make the necessary local inquiries with a view to preparing a schime in advance for the delimitation of the areas of the prop? osed District Boards.    Thi3 scheme would be embodied ml a schedule to the Bill,    The Commissioners might al&amp;d  ^ perhaps prepare schemes for the constitution or the District Boards with the view of submitting these schemes, or at least the most pressing of them, to Parliament for . confirmation either concurrently with or immediately after the passing of the enabling legislation.I should also propose to consult these Commissioners on all important proposals for new stations or extensions that might be made in the meantime in order to ensure, as far as possible, that they did not conflict with the general scheme that would eventually be worked out,I propose that these Commissioners shall be paid salaries of not less than  3,000 per annum (as recommended by the Committee) and that the Commissioners so appointed snail be members of the oermanent Commission constituted by the Bill.I should explain that it is intended to provide in the Bill that the whole expenses of the Commissioners shall be receovereo from the electricity undertakings of the country by a charge levied upon them pro^rata to revenue, and all expenses incurred in advance olTthe as sage of the Bill, if my proposal ,$s adopted, will also e charged to the same fund,    In the meantime they must be temporarily advanced by the Treasury.I estimate that by taking this-course at least a ear will be saved, and, in the circumstances I consider hat this saving of invaluable time amply justifies the Government in taking the small risk that ultimately Parliament nay fail to pass the Bill, in which case&apos;the expense incurred in the&apos; meantime would of course be irre-coverable, aid the Commission would come to an endaA.
