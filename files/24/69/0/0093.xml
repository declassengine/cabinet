Secret.1A2   01219 0 96zVBISDGSS   All!)&apos;.7AGF!8   BILLS.Axtcr the Conference which was hold on Wednesday with the representatives of the Employers&apos; Federations and the Trade Unions, the employers1 representatives and the worrroeople^J re resenta-tives had separate, meetings at which they considered the statements whioh had been made to them on behalf of&apos;the Government, together with the suggestions made by the &quot;rime Minister that they should appoint a Committee to consult with the Government on the Pledges hill end the Iv^fos Bill,     The. employers at their meeting nominated a Corrmmttee of IB, representative of all the principal trader concerned.    At the meeting of the Trade Unian representatives a Committee was appointed consisting of 16 persons, with Mr. Arthur Een&amp;erron as Chairman.    The Amalgamated Society of Engineers, the Steam Engine Makers&apos; Society, the United Machine Workers, and, I undersIand, sone of the other purely engineering societies, dec]ined to have anything to do with the appointment of the Committee. They were, I think, considering only the Pledges Bill - not the Wages Bill - and in regard to this Bill tho Engineering Societies probably felt that as they are more closely afiected by the que-roion of the restoration of Trade Union customs they ought to have separate consultation with the Government.     It would be open to us to argue that, apart from the engineering trades, a number of agreements as to dilution, relaxation of practices etc., were made with other trades, but in point of fact there is no doubt that the engineering unions are the unions who are primarily concerned.     Moreover, at the meeting, in red./ to a question by Mr. J.E. Thomas, who pointed out that certain industries would wish to consider the matter as affecting themselves particularly, the Prime Minister indicated that there would be no objection to such a course..     It is for consideration therefore whether it would not be a irisable that the position should be recognised and that stops should be taken to ascertain the point of view of the Engineering Unions, .I am meeting the members of the Labour Committee at 2 o1clock tomorrow to discuss thei &apos;-wages Bill (which is a matter of extreme urgency.) and shall then be in a position to consider what steps -should be taken with regard to the Engineering Unions.(Signed) Geo; H. Roberts.14/11/1918.
