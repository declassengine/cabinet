The number of outbreaks of Sheep Scab was 4, Glanders 1, Parasitic :.ange 14 and babies 10,   Of these outbreaks of Rabies, one case occurred at Penzance in a dog that was to some extent connected with the earlier case at \7adebridge, and one near Bodmin in a stray dog.   These two cases make two fresh centres of disease in Cornwall,   The Board have now applied control of dogs restrictions to the whole of Devon and Cornwall.Veterinary Department.Anti-swine fever serum.14,750 cc. were issued for distribution to keep up the stocks at the various centres.Anti-abortion vacoine.10,400 cc, (208 doses) were manufactured, put up in a suitable form, and despatched for use on infected farms.Rabies.During the week in question 11 specimens have been received for examination.The general work of the Department including the examination of swine fever visoera and materials, Anthrax and sheep scab materials and making other post morten examinations, went on as usual.Commercial Control Branch.The work of the Branch during the week has consisted of enquiries and correspondence as to the improvement of rural transport and extended commercial control after the war, loss of milk churns in transit by rail, the approval of names for margarine, and oorres-pondence on matters arising in connection with the Sale of Food and Drugs&apos; Act and the fertilisers and Feeding Stuffs Act,Lajor General Harrison, W.O., conferred with the 2&amp;nch as to&apos; .the general policy of the Biggleswade&apos; iagricultural Tramroad Scheme.I One application for the Board&apos;s consent to the institution of proceedings under the Fertilisers and Feeding Stuffs Act has been t received from a Local Authority during the week. *Publications Branch.The number of applications for ordinary issues of the leaflets was 639, in response to which 2459 copies were despatched.In addition 37,900 copies of the leaflets were despatched to applicants for supplies in bulk for distribution.During the week Food Production Leaflet Ho, 56 (Floods and Waterlogged Land:   The Land drainage Act, 1918) was published, copies being sent to 11,000 persons on the relative leaflet list.
0 00 0Applications were received for 360 copies of the Three 3ound Volumes of Leaflets, and 1516 copies of the pamphlet &quot;How to manage an Allotment&quot; were sent out.Tho usual enquiries &quot;bearing directly and indirectly on agricultural publications have been received and dealt with by the Branch.flax Production BranchA nGw contract for the 1919 crop has now been approved under which the burden of providing the labour necessary for harvesting the crop will be imposed upon the Grower, who, however, will receive an increased price of 21am Straw, stacked and thatched in good condition.   It is believed lihat a great saving of money and labour will result by avoiding the necessity cf importing labour, often from a great distance, which must be housed, fed and paid   even when weather conditions preclude any progress in harvest operations.   There will also be a great saving in the transport of labour.   At the same time the Branoh undertakes to bring Growers into touoh with existing organisations for the supply of such labour as may be available in the vicinity of the cropa.The Flax Control Board has been requested to arrange to accept immediate delivery of seed as it is produced and it is hoped to commence shipments to Belfast at an early date.Deseeding Stations have now.been provided with carts, horses and miscellaneous equipment.Considerable adjustment of Deseeding Hollers has been found necessary and is bein; carried out.uanagers, technical experts, supervisors and female staff have in most cases been provided, and nearly all Deseeding Stations will be in full operation during the present month.Land Division.Small Holding Colonies.Pa trig?; ton.   The weather has been slightly warmer and mors settled.   There is still a large area of potatoes and mangolds to get in, and the soldiers who were released for harvest work are bein?; recalled which accentuates the labour difficulties at the Colony.   It is hoped, however, that the Agricultural Executive Committee will be able to arrange for   he additional labour required.holbeach.   The potato crop on the Colony is e good one and consequently the work of lifting is vory heavy.   Extra soldiers have been obtained, and they, together with the women and other labourers, are busily employed in harvesting the potato crop. The settlers are busy securing their own potatoes and helping with the other crop, and the Director reports that they are excellent men.   Taere are now 27 settlers on the Colony of whom 24, having finished their period of probation, have taken or are about to take holdings.H? fth Hill. The actual raising of potatoes is finished, 70 acres in        and 30   ores of the land is now ready for drilling corn.   Progress has been made with ploughing preparatory to corn sowing.
Tithe, Copyhold, Ooamons anj. Survey Branch.In accordance with the instructions given by the President in anticipation of tho passing of the Tithe Bill now before Parliament, a draft of a revised&apos;Scale of Fees to be taken in cases of the voluntary redemption of tithe rantcharge and corn rents has been submitted for consideration.   Ihvi effect of the proposed Scale will be to reduce, slightly   in the case of small amounts of tithe rentoharge, and substantially in the case of larger sums, the charges under the existing Scale. The purpose of this revision is to assist in carrying out one of the main objects of the Bill, viz., the facilitation and encouragement of redemption.The Survey section of the Branch have made a field survey of a portion of holbeach Small Holding Colony, and have staked and marked out the areas of    certain of the holdings.The normal work of the Braaoh with regard to enfranchisement? redemptions and altered apportionments of tithe rentchar^e and in other matters proceeded as usual,gelham Estate. The weather during the past fortnight has been in our favour and  has enabled the wheat sowing to be completed, and good progress to be made with other autumn, crops.*iteam ploughing has been of inestimable value to the estate this year.   By its use in the early spring 500 aores were ploughed and sown with spring oorn (o,; very rough land) uuring threo months; Bince harvest the same land has been ploughed again and resown with 355   acres of winter corn.   Moot of this corn is well up and in good condition,     especially having regard to the fact that the land has prouaoed very little for many years.Manure sowing, leading and distributing lime, slag and flue dust has been in operation: during the past^two weeks 50 acres have been slagged. 30 acres limed, and 20 acres have been sown with farm-yard manure and 40 aores with flue dust.Threshing has been in progress to provide straw for cattle in yards.Live Stook Branoh. 4 applications were approved for the export of 41 cattle.3	d*.	do.	do.	do.	do.	905	do.	do.	do.	do.	do.	381	do.	do.	do.	do.	do.	325	do.	do.	do.	do.	do.	12The normal work of making grants for Bulls, Boars and Heavy Horses proceeded as usual.
DOStatistical pivision,Statistical Branch,Tho tabulation of the produce returns is almost complete:   there remaining but one return still to be received.Tho Inter-Depart, ental Committee cn Live Stool: and &quot;Jeat Production met on the 30th October and 1st Hovember.   They find that the total number of cattle in Great Britain declined by about 20,000 head during the month, although the dairy herd increased by some 20,000.   The reduction in the number of sheep was about a million, but breeding ewes remained stationary. These changes are about normal for the time of year.   Pigs on agricultural holdings increased by about 110,000, owing doubtless to the recent increase in breeding:   but breeding sows declined by some 5,000, probably on account of anticipated difficulties in procuring feeding stuffs during the winter.The Committee also considered the probable quantity of beef likely to be forthcoming from the herds of Great Britain during the next 12 months.   Taking into consideration the shortage of feeding stuffs during the winter, and other disturbing factors likely to affect the normal slaughter, the Committee estimated that some 2,200,000 head of cattle would be likely to come forward (including imports from Ireland), as compared with 2,050,000 in the past 12 months.   The quantity of beef was likely, however, to be short during the first half of 1919;   and the Committee estimated that the amount in each quarter was likely to be as follows:- 142,000 tens up to 31st December, 125,000 tons to 31st larch, 123,000 tons to 30th June, and 133,000 tons during the three summer months of 1919. This is exclusive of veal.A press notice was issued by the Ministry of Pood some 10 days ago, announcing a new scale of prices for live cattle and sheep, to come into force on 1st November, under which an additional average allowance of l/** per head ever the previous maximum is to be allowed for sheep.   Ho Order to this effect has, however, yet been issued, and the few reports to hand from the live stock markets, show no increase in the price of sheep since last week, so that the announcement does not, up to the present, appear to have affected the trade. There have been fewer oomplaints of fat,cattle having been refused than a week ago, but the numbers coming forward were rather lower.Agricultural Wages Board.Ho meeting of the wages Board or of any of its Committees has been held during the week, and no minimum rates have come into operation, or Notice of Proposal issued.   The work of the Office has consisted mainly in dealing with correspondence and with matters arising out of the last meeting of the Doard, and matters to come up at the next meeting.   Further&apos;progress has been made with the work of preparing the material for the report of the Committee on &quot;Farming Costs and Cost of Living&quot;.During last week 96 cases of complaint of non-payment of the minimum rates were received.   A large number of these are being dealt with in the first instance by correspondence. Forty cases of complaint were sent to the Inspectors for visit in the following counties:-   Devon, Somerset, Sussex, Kent, Essex, Cambs., Warwick, Leicester, Shropshire.   Fifteen cases of complaint were completed in various ways.   Reports were reoeived from Inspectors on 37 cases.
Joint Committoe of the Board of Agriculture and the hinistry of Pood.A deputation, selected from the Joint Committee Representatives for Northumberland and accompanied by Professor Gilchrist of the Armstrong College, Newcastle-on-Tyne, visited the Harper Adams Agricultural College for the purpose of examining the details of a soiling system for milch cov/s practised there, with a view to investigating the possibilities for adaptation to Northumberland farming practice.In the opinion of the Deputy Director and Captain Hainan who were present on behalf of the Joint Committee, the examination was eminently successful in demonstrating the possibilities of the introduction of a modification of this system with Northumbrian farming practice.A great deal of irritation has been created among farmers having damaged grain, owing to delay in obtaining the names and addresses of the Grain Officers appointed for their districts *During the past week, the Deputy Direotor met in conference the Somerset Representatives of the Joint   Committee at Taunton and the Devon Representatives at 2xeter with satis-faotory results.Ordnance Survey.During the week ending 5th November 1918, maps were despatched as follows:-War Office.............   3,038.Air Ministry...........15,941Admiralty..............   3,234Overseas..............,125,602Other services .........   1,697Seven men embarked for the Pi eld Survey Companies in France and 14 men for the Overseas Branch, Ordnance Survey.In other respects, the work of the Board proceeds on lines previously indicated.Secretary.November, 1918,
