HOT?, by GENERAL SRELY.With reference to Var Cabinet 4R7, Miruts 12, telegramshave been received from Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and newfoundland, agreeing to the proposals of my Committee a3 ap-proved by the War Cabinet, except that all but South Africa wishto extend the date till the end of 1915.No reply ha3 yet been received from Canada, but I have3poken to General Sir R.E.W,Turner and have little doubt that the reply from Canada will be to the game effect as the others.   Ipropose, with the concurrence of the War Cabinet  (1) Extending the final date from 5/8/15 to 31/12/15.( ) To provide for the inclusion of the Bismarck Archipelago as a theatre of war, in accordance with the second Australian proposal.Sir R, Brade has written,on behalf of the Army Council,stating that, while the Council regard any extension as a movedown a slippery slope, the matter is one for the Cabinet to d0cidI do not agree with the &quot;slippery slope&quot; argument, believing that the end of the year 1915 is a reasonable date to choose initself.   Moreover, that date is suitable, for th-3 reasons givenin the attached Memorandum by the Secretary to the Committee.(Initialled) J.S.,7.11.13.
