THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S OOTOSMENT.SECRET.G.T.6273.WAR   CABINET.MINISTRY OF SUPPLY.(Reference War Cabinet 600 Minute 9.)Memorandum by Sir A. Mond.I understand the question of a central Ministry of Supply is now under the consideration of the War Cabinet.     I venture, however, to lay before the War Cabinet the follow-ing conclusions for their consideration.I agree with the soundness of the suggestion to create one Central Supply Department in which would be concentrated the cervices at preoent performed independently by several Government Departments, more especially in connection with the purchase and distribution of all stores for Government purposes. The advantages of such a Central authority are manifold.   I set forth a number of then :-(a) The economy which would be effected by purchasing in enormous bulk.(b) The elimination of competition between Departments.(c) The establishment of a central authority which would(l)   Standardise articles of a similar character required by various Departments.(2)   Insist on ordinary trade designs being used more than at present.(3)   Adopt as quickly as possible improvements or inventions exploited by ouciness firms.(4)   Take full advantage of the ever changing state of the market in labour and materials.(5)   Decide the order or&quot; urgency in meeting the demands cf various Departments.(6)   Standardise inspection methods.(7)   Set free for purely naval and military duties those&quot;offioers in the Navy and Army who are now engaged on the purchase and distribution of Stores, etc..The experience during the War has shown that even a temporary expedient, like the Colwyn Committee, has led to very valuable results both in economy of money and saving of time.     The Office of Works Supply Department has acted a3 agent   in the purchase of furniture and other.commodities -for other Departments with great success,,     The exchange of information, utilisation of technical officers, and the combination of contracts have enabled schemes to be carried out cheaply and speedily in a manner previously impossible. It is obvious that these advantages would be enhanced by the creation of one   Supply Department.
9 i 9 fj ... 0It has &quot;been proposed that the Ministry of Munitions, being the largest Supply Department at present in existence, should be transformed into a future Ministry of Supply.      On the whole this wfuld ae^m t   bo the m: St praotioal curse f  fcfl-pt.I would, however, like to urge that the organisation of a new Department of this charaoter would require meet careful consideration.   . It will in reality be a great business house, and its-constitution should be made to resemble a business house as much as possible, consistently with Government Departmental practice.     To be successful, its staff must consist to a considerable extent of very able business men, and of subordinates well acquainted with the technical specialities of the various industries from which they have to buy.     In the Supply Department at my Office, this ha3 been largely achieved in the past, most of the exeoutive officers having had business experience and special training.    The results have been very satisfactory. If this view is conceded the whule idea of the Staff of this Offiee and the methods by whioh it is to be recruited, the salaries which are to be paid, and the question of pensions, would have to be oonsidered from a different standpoint to what has been oustomary thus far in the Civil Service.     All business men who have gone into Government Offices are practically unanimous in their view as to the inadequacy of the present soale of Government salaries, more especially for the higher officers.     The first class men required for a Ministry of this charaoter will not be obtainable on the present scale of remuneration, yet without them a Mini id-try of this kind would not achieve the objects for which it is to be set up.As a suggested outline, I venture to submit the following proposal, without - binding myself, however, to all its details :-Tho now Department should not be a mere amalgamation of the Contracts Branches of the various Departments, but should be independent of all other Departments, and should have as its head a Minister of Cabinet rank.     It should have the power to enforce its decisions cn the demanding Departments, and should possess on its staff highly trained financial and technical experts.     Its constitution should resemble that of a great business house as much as possible, having its Chairman, who should be the Minister, and a Board of Directors.     It should have two Secretaries, one Financial to preside over the accounting staff of the Department, authorise expenditure, prepare estimates for Parliament, etc, and the ,other General, with a small staff to deal with questiens affect-ing the office as a whole.     The Board might consist of a member cf the Treasury, the two Secretaries, three Heads of important business houses, and say three ^f the Managers of Branches of the Department.     So far as general financial principles are concerned, the Department should be under the Treasury, but should be directly responsible to. Parliament through its Minister,     The Minister should have the power to select the staff, and fix their salaries independently of the Treasury and Civil Service Commission.     He would be guided in thOso matters by the recommendations of the Board. No member of the upper staff should be engaged with less than five years experience in business, and all appointments should be temporary.     A Superannuation Fund should be created to which all members of the staff should be ocmpslled^to contribute, the salaries being fixed high enough to secure
efficient service. The terms of employment generally should he these in practice in the best business htuses(Signed) ALFRED MOND. .H.M. Of floe- of Wyafcs,
