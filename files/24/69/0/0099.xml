^7&quot;; [This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government]\      &apos; f &quot; &apos;&apos; &quot;&quot; ii.ii i ju-nnCONFIDENTIAL,THE INDIANS AND GERMAN EAST AFRICA.Memorandum by Mr. Walter Long.IN a recent paper (G.T.-6028) Mr. Montagu has called attention to Sir T. Morison&apos;s propos il that German East Africa should, if we are able to control its future, be, reserved as a colony for Indians from India. The scheme has been discussed by Lord Curzon in a later paper (G.T.-60&apos;J2), and the object of the present memorandum is to call attention to the difficulties which, from the African point of view, appear to me to lie in the way of its adoption.The chief arguments in favour of the proposal appear to be : That it will tend to diminish the discontent felt by Indians at the restrictions imposed upon their settlement in the Dominions.That it will help to reward India for the part which she has played in the War;and lastly (although this consideration appears to be somewhat subordinated to the others) That Indian colonisation will be for the benefit of the native inhabitants.I do not propose to discuss the question of Indian emigration to our Dominions, as the facts are well known to my colleagues. But that German East Africa offers any great prospect of relieving the situation appears to me to be very doubtful. As Lord Curzon says, it is, of course, not proposed to exclude Indians from German East Africa anymore than they are from British East Africa; but, although Indian immigration into the latter country has been in progress for centuries, the total adult population at the present time is only some 8,500 (G,282 males -f- 2,231 females), of whom 1,498 are Government employes. Out of the whole of this population only 52 are classed as agriculturists, and these appear to be the market gardeners at Nairobi and some of the other trade centres. If, then, the emigration of the Indian agriculturist takes place under normal conditions, there seems to be but little prospect of its affecting the situation as regards the Dominions. On the other hand, if it is artificially stimulated, either by Government assistance or in other ways, and emigrants are introduced in great numbers, it seems certain from what is stated in a later part of this paper that a serious position will arise with regard to the native population.To turn to the second argument, I fully recognise the great part played by Indian soldiers in the War, but I share Lord Curzon&apos;s view that the doctrine that they are therefore entitled as an act of justice to this territory is untenable, and, if accepted, could not be confined to Indians alone. An equally strong claim could be advanced by the natives of our Colonies and Protectorates in tropical Africa, for, in proportion to their population and resources, their sacrifices both in men and money have not fallen short of those which have been made by India. It is beyond question that the brunt of the fighting both in German East Africa and the Cameroons has been borne by-troops recruited in these possessions, and it is only the recent collapse of Turkey which has prevented the employment of contingents of these fine soldiers in yet another theatre of war.But I am of opinion, and I believe that the view would receive strong support in this country, that it is mainly, if not entirely, with reference to the last of the argu-ments mentioned above that the scheme must be judged, and that, if there is good reason to suppose that it will not be for the benefit of the natives of the country, we are bound in common justice to them as the original occupiers to let the matter drop. The remarks in the 5th and 6th.paragraphs of Lord Curzons paper cannot but cause grave misgivings on this point, and the information supplied by the civil administrator of the territory, who has now had ample time to make himself acquainted with local conditions, only strengthens my apprehensions.Sir H. Byatt strongly deprecates the adoption of the scheme. He points: out that to settle large numbers of Indian colonists would be impossible without infringing the rights of the natives ; ,that native labour even before the war was a growing difficulty, and: that the increased demand which would arise ultimately out of Indian settlement would complicate still further a problem which will be hard to solve in any case.   He
states that the German policy of granting Europeans extensive tracts and forcing natives to work on them has been condemned widely as destructive of native progress, and that Indian settlement would lead eventually to similar objections, even if natives were only employed in transporting produce. With regard to the proposed employment of native Indians to administer the country, he expresses the conviction based on long observation of the relations between the two races, that it would fail for the reason that Africans regard Indians generally with no respect.I have also reason to know that the scheme is causing great uneasiness among the white community in British East Africa, which in proportion to its numbers and resources has made very heavy sacrifices in connection with the war, and has con-tributed a material share to the work of overcoming the enemy resistance in German East Africa. In fact, Lord Cranworth, who is one of the leading settlers in British East Africa, and has taken part in the campaign, recently propose 1 to raise the whole question in the House -of Lords. This attitude on the part of the Europeans is not surprising in view of the experience which they have gained of Indian emigration in the adjoining territory of British East Africa.A former Governor of that Protectorate was able to write : &quot; With the construction of the Uganda Railway large numbers of Indian coolies were imported a fact ever to be regretted. They were of low caste, many remained, but have not taken up agriculture, the bulk have become traders and have given a low commercial tone to the whole up-country, and had the worst of influences on the vast native populations with which they have come in contact. This opinion is held, not only by administrative officers, but by every missionary in the country the former allege cheating and extortion in commercial matters, constant conviction for using false weights, debasement of coinage, and even pillage of the simpler natives; the latter deplore the moral condition of the Indians, his concubinage with the native, his entire lack of sanitary precautions.&quot;It is not of course suggested that the Khojas, to whom Lord Curzon refers, and the better-class Hindus in the country come within this category.In the latter part of his paper Mr. Montagu refers to correspondence with the Colonial Office about the prohibition of Indians from residing in certain parts ,of Mombasa, and, that there may be no misapprehension as to the nature of it, I desire to set out the facts as briefly as possible.In 1913 Professor W. J. Simpson was asked by the Colonial Office to visit British East Africa for the purpose of examining and reporting on the sanitary condition of the Protectorate. Professor Simpson is one of the leading experts on tropical sanitation. He was for some years Health Officer of Calcutta, and has therefore special knowledge of Indian conditions. In the course of a very full and able report he pointed out that the lack of control over buildings, &amp;c, in the towns of the Protectorate, combined with the intermingling in the same quarters of races with different customs and habits, accounted for many of the insanitary conditions in them and for the extension of disease from one race to another. He stated that it had &quot; to be recognised that the standard and mode of life of the Asiatic do not ordinarily consort with the European, whilst the customs of Europeans are at times not acceptable to the Asiatics, and that those of the African unfamiliar with and not adapted to the new conditions of town life will not blend with either. Also that the diseases to which these different races are respectively liable are readily transferable to the European and vice versa, a result specially liable to occur when their dwellings are near each other.&quot;He was therefore of opinion that, in the interests of each community and of the healthiness of the locality and country, it was absolutely essential that in every town and trade centre the town planning should provide well-defined and separate quarters for Europeans, Asiatics, and Africans, and that there should be a protective belt of open country between the different quarters. It was in pursuance of this policy that Indians were not allowed to bid at a recent auction of Government land in Mombasa, as the land in question fell within the area which had been marked out for the European quarter. It will be seen, therefore, that the question is one of sanitation and not of discrimination against any particular race on the ground of colour. 1 see no ground for setting aside the advice of so competent an authority as Professor Simpson, and thus increasing the risks to human life in a country where they are already sufficiently serious.
