1)(U\. (3 3ConfidentialPOLITICAL INTELLIGENCE nllAIMiiOT(11 Nov. 1918)FOREIGN OFFICE.GERMANY/022M E MO R AN D U MTHE SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC PARTIES AND LEADERS   IN   GERMANY.In an interesting conversation this morning, M: Martna, Diplomatic Representative of the government of Esthland, member of the Esthonian Diet and Civy Councillor of Reval, gave some account of the Social Democratic Parties and sections of parties in Germany and of those of their leaders who are coming to the front in the Revolution.    He also discussed the prospects of the various sections and tbe question of the organisation of public order.M: Marina is himself an Bsthonian Social Democrat of moderate tendencies , although he formerly cooperated with Whd local Bolsheviks on the City Council of Reval.     He has spent long periods in Germany before the war and is personally acquainted with all the Socialist Leaders.     He is a man of education and seems to have ability and good sense.political organiser *    He has great self-sommand, -$an hold his tongue and keep himself in the background until he is wanted. (The Majority Socialist Congress at Wfvraburg in October, 1917, over which Ebert presided, .gave an opportunity for the display of his remarkable tact in managing an assembly in which contra-dictory opinions often clashed.     It was evident that he enjoyed in a high degree the confidence and respect of the party delegates.)      Ebert is a self-educated man, sprung from the working-classes, but his self-education has been remarkably thorough.Ebert, the Chancellor, he described as a very able
M: Martna is of opinion that Ebert would desire, in the spirit of the Wurzburg Congress, to organise tho transition period of tho revolution so as to prevent economic convulsions. His object would be to support the existing capitalist system until Germany recovered he? economic stability.    At Wtaburg it was expressly declared that in view of the danger,of complete economic disaster after the war, the Socialist Party must pro-visionally revise its views on capitalism and must be prepared to use the existing capitalist organisation in order to pull the country through a formidable crisis.. . ..11: Martina nevertheless does not expeot that Ebert will be able to retain the direction of affairs for long. His Chancellorship may not last beyond a few weeks or even a few days.     The Majority Socialists, particularly Scheidemann and Ebert., have, he thinks, compromised themselves too gravelyby their support, of tho old regime during the war.-In M: Martna&apos;s opinion the Minority Socialists, led by Haase and Le&amp;ebour, possess the confidence of the bulk of working classes.     It is true that recent by-elections have gone in favour of the Majority Socialists, but this M: Martna attributes to their control of the party presst and organisa-tion,    For the purposes of the revolution the Minority leaders have been taken into partnership by the Majority and have re-asserted their influence in all spheres of $arty activity. The revolutionary spirit will probably tell in their-favour. Haase is a master of the art of appealing to.the masses and so, above all, is liebknecht, although his political ideas are often confused.    Liebkneoht is at,present cooperating with the Minority leaders from whom sharp differences had hitherto divided him.&apos;    It is stated in the telegrams that he pro-fesses to assume responsibility for the conduct of the Berlin police and for the universal liberation of political prisoners,.
1 191(N.B..   M. Martna evidently sympathises with the Minority rather than with the Majority loaders).H: Martna thinks that if Lbert goes it will not be the extreme section of the Minority - liobknecht, hosa Luxembourg, and the Spartacus Group that will come into power.     It will rather be Haase, Ledebour, Kautsky and their followers.Of Haase, with whom M: Martna is personally well acquainted, he gives a much more favourable account than might have been expected.     He describes him as cool, clear-headed, able and endowed with gifts of leadership.     Ledebour., his lieutenant, he regards as also a very competent person, with a good knowledge of foreign affairs and particularly cf English conditions.Asked if a Minority Socialist Government would be inclined to fraternise with the Russian Bolsheviks, he replied that he thought they would not.     Kautsky had recently in a pamphlet repudiated the dictatorial methods of Bolshevism as entirely contrary to the spirit of true Social Democracy.Asked if a Minority Socialist Government would be propagandist, i.e8 if they wculd try to spread their doctrines in England, France and Italy, with a view to bringing about radical changes in the social and politioal conditions of these countries, he replied that he thought it very probable that they wculd make such attempts,     On the other hand, he mentioned that Ledebour, who is the authority in that Party on Foreign Affairs, had opposed at the Copenhagen Congress in 1910 the idea of a general European strike for political objects.    He did not think that men like Ledebour would encourage rash sohemes abroad while Germany had suoh enormous problems of organisation to solve at home.
Replying to a question as to whether it was likely that a Social Democratic Government would exercise sufficientfirmness in the prevention and punishment of excesses on thepart of sporadic organisations like Soldiers ancl \&apos;;orkmensUnions, Ivi: kar-tna owned that he doubted it.     It would hedifficult for the Social Democrats, who,when in opposition,had so often condemned official severity in the maintenanceof order, to exercise seveiity themselves against adherents theofASocial Democratic cause, even where the circumstances demanded it.There was therefore, he admittedj a danger of imprudent acts and even disorder and violence, although he hoped that cases of this might be few and isolated.     It must be remembered that the German working-classes were far more intelligent and far better educated than the Russian. Nor has there been any extreme revolutionary element among the German peasantry who form so large a proportion of the population.The Majority Socialists have declared their opinion that, pending the election,of a Constituent Assembly and its future decisions, it will be wise to retain in the Government representatives of the non-Socialist but reform-ing Parties, i.e. the Catholic Centre and the Radicals. L: kartna fears that a conflict mcy arise on this important point with the extremer elements among the Linority Social-ists.     He thinks that these extreme elements will be making a great mistake.he was surprised to hear that the age of 24 seemed to be contemplated as the franchise age for the suffrage. He had thought that the age would be reduced to 21.The Women^ suffrage movement, he said, had com-pletely triumphed in the Revolution, and he thought that the
consequences would be far-reaching and beneficent.     Contrary to the opinion whioh has sometimes been expressed in pre-revolution times, he considered the two female Socialist leaders, Kosa Luxemburg (&amp; Polish Jewess) and Clara 2etkin, to be able and sensible1women.Discussing the action of the German revolutionary soldiers, 11-, kartna pointed out that the revolution had largely been made by Reservists, older men in the home garri-sons, who were thoroughly imbued with the Social Democratic ideas of organisation and party discipline.     The Soviet m methods were necessary in order to start the Revolution and break the power of the old regime of militarism and bureau-democracy.    But he hoped that thf&quot; soldier element would gradual-ly merge in triumphant democracy and submit to democratic order.     The action of the men who will return from the front is more problematicalc
