In a Eill on -another, occasion and that the purpose of the machinery.clauses can be secured by adtptation of the Munitions Tribunals and administrative action on the part of the Ministry of Labour.The present Bill follows much the same lines as an earlier .&quot;??1I&apos;1 (of 1917) to which the Government accepted amendments, agreed with the trade unions concerned.(Sgd) C.
