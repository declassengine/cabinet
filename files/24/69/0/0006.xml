This Document is, the Property.of His Britaiiuic Majestys Grave;Printed for the War Cabinet.   November 1918.SECRET. G.T.-6206.WAR CABINET.AUSTRALIAN PURCHASES COMMITTEE. (War Cabinet 477, Minute 16.)IN forwarding the Report of the Australian Purchases Committee Mr. Chamberlain desires it to be recorded that the representatives of the Treasury and the Ministry of Shipping, together with Mr. Andrew Weir, would not be prepared to recommend any form of purchase if the matter were regarded from an economic standpoint only, but have signed the Report on the assumption stated by the Chancellor of the Exchequer that some compromise is desirable on higher political grounds, in which case they consider that the proposals embodied in the Report are the best that can be framed.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1, November 6, 1918.Report of the Australian Purchases Committee.1. This Committee was set up by War Cabinet 477, Minute 16, to consider the question of purchases of Australian supplies in the following circumstances : Agreements having been entered into by His Majesty&apos;s Government from time to time for the purchase of the Australian output of certain commodities, His Majesty&apos;s Government are now asked to purchase the entire surplus production of Australian copper and lead for a period of ten years after the war. Mr. Hughes considers it the duty of His Majesty&apos;s Government to make these additional contracts on account of the loss which Australia has suffered by the withdrawal of British tonnage from the Australian trade and the voluntary surrender of the bulk of Australian ocean-going and coast tonnage, by which it has become impossible to dispose of Australian produce. The Ministry of Shipping considers that it will be impossible to move the lead and copper during the war owing to the length of the voyage. In view of the Treasury it is&apos; impossible without parliamentary authority to sanction the purchase of supplies which cannot be delivered during the war. Mr. Hughes urges, on the other hand, that Australia should not be prejudiced to this extent merely on account of her geographical position.The Chancellor of the Exchequer considers that, on grounds of general policy, a compromise should be arranged, but that it must be one which is capable of defence on business lines, and that the matter should also be considered from the point of view of the supply of raw materials after the war.2. We are informed that an agreement has already been made for the purchase of the entire Australian wool clip for the period of the war and one year after .at a guaranteed minimum price, 15^d. per lb., which is considerably lower than the price prevailing in America and other parts of the world. It is now proposed that the wool required by the Allies for military purposes should be supplied to them, as it already is to the British Government, at the minimum&apos;price. Wool supplied for civil purposes is to be paid for at &quot; Bradford issue prices,&quot; and any profits realised by the sale of this portion of the wool are shared equally between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Australian producers.An agreement has also been made for the purchase of the entire Australian surplus of zinc concentrates at a fixed price which is low, and therefore to our advantage, up to an annual quantity of 100,000 tons, any excess of price realised for the surplus being divided equally between the producers and His Majesty&apos;s Government.[973] B
A draft agreement for the purchase cf the balance of the wheat crop for 1916-17 and the whole of 1917-18 crop, after satisfying Australian requirements, is in the hands of Mr. Hughes. Mr. Hughes has within the last few days raised a new point  that the British Government shall share with the Australian farmer any profit made by sale of the wheat above the proposed price 38s. a quarter. We have not thought it necessary to enter on this question.3. The two remaining products of importance are copper and lead. In the case of copper there is no danger of shortage, and we have no interest at present in purchasing Australian supplies. It was, indeed, suggested at the Imperial Conference this year that there is a danger of the United Kingdom becoming absolutely dependent on the American supplies of copper, and that it was desirable to be able to secure supplies from the Empire. In the opinion of the Australian Government a long-dated contract would be the most effective means of ensuring the development of the Australian copper mines. We are not greatly impressed by this argument. The Australian production is under 3 per cent, of the world&apos;s output, and. cannot under any circumstances relieve us from dependence on American supplies. We shall therefore proceed upon the assumption that if such a purchase is to be made it can only be justified as part of the price paid to Australia for the bargain as a whole or on the grounds of Imperial obligation put forward by Mr. Hughes.Copper Supplies of the World.Production of	Copper Metal	Percentage ofduring the Year	World Supply.1917.

The United Kingdom has therefore an interest in securing control of the Australian supply if reasonable terms can be arranged. We have accordingly considered that terms can be offered.As a result of prolonged discussion the Board of Trade and the representative of the Australian producers have agreed to the following scheme for submission to His Majesty&apos;s Government.In considering what terms would be acceptable to British trade the Board of Trade had the advantage of the advice of Mr. Budd, Colonel A. J. Foster, chairman of the Lead Manufacturers&apos; Association, and Mr. Clive Cookson: 1st. Period. During the war, subject to six months&apos; notice on either side, after an. armistice has been declared.271. 19s. per ton f.o.b. Port Pirie. 281. 5s. per ton f.o.b. Sydney.

Following on (l), until the Board of Trade declare in writing that there is no restriction on the use of lead in United Kingdom or on freights.Average London market price less 1 per cent, with guaranteed minimum.221.

Port Pirie. 171. 16s. f.o.b. Sydney.The British Government would undertake to purchase the entire surplus Australian production after providing for (a.) Australian consumption.(&amp;.&apos;) Australian geographical markets.Sales by Australia for her domestic consumption and her geographical markets are not to exceed 35 per cent, of output.The expression &quot; average London market price &quot; is, we think, ambiguous and might give rise to dispute. As the Australian and Burmese output of lead is some 20 per cent, of the worlds supply, the British Government would be able to exercise considerable control over the average London market price. We therefore propose to employ the words &quot;price realised &quot; instead of &quot; London market price.&quot;No question arises as to the terms for the first period. There seems little reason to question the prices for the second period, but it should last only so long as there are Government restrictions for the use of lead in this country. Prices for the third period are perhaps fixed unduly high. We think a minimum of 15/. or 16Z. would be a more appropriate figure in the event of the bargain being for a purchase outright; if, however, the proposal introduced farther on in this report that the arrangement should be one for sharing profits between the prices realised and the guaranteed minimum, the figure mentioned above, 171. 10s.-17l. 16s., might be accepted.The average price in the second and third periods should be calculated over the period of the calendar year.4. In the case of copper, Mr. Hughes has proposed that during the balances of the war period and six months after the Australian surplus production of copper over the requirements of her local and geographical markets shall be purchased by His Majesty&apos;s Government on the same basis as purchases made from the United States of America. Thereafter for a period of ten years Australia will guarantee her surplus production over her own consumption and the requirements of her geographical markets in return for a guaranteed minimum price of 80Z. per ton c.i.f. United Kingdom ports, the payments to be based on the average monthly prices of London Exchange less an agreed commission of \ per cent.The prices for electrolytic copper in the London market for the last ten years have been:  highest.lowest.average of the prices during the year.	 	s.	d.	 	s.	d.	 	s.	d.1908 .........	6,6	5	0	59	5	0	62	3	21909 ............	63	10	o	58	10	0	60	11	61910............	63	10	0	56	5	0	59	12	61911a*.         .. *         ,..         ,,,	66	5	0	55	17	6	58	4	71912............	82	10	0	64	10	0	76	10	51913............	81	17	6	65	5	0	72	3	81914............	68	10	0	52	10	0	62	5	21915............	108	0	0	61	0	0	84	2	71916............	169	10	0	110	0	0	138	0	101917............	149	0	0	123	0	0	136	8	10It will be seen that under the present arrangement we are paying 110L per ton in Australia for copper of which no use can be made.   This is less than the price paid for
American copper, namely 1221., but the American copper is available for use during the war. This agreement was originally made at the time when it was expected that a much larger proportion of copper could be utilised, and was renewed for a short period as a concession to Australia after that hope had been abandoned. It represents in our opinion the maximum sacrifice which the United Kingdom can be asked to make in relief of the Australian situation, and if it becomes necessary to continue the arrange-ment beyond the close of the present year&apos; every effort should be made to secure a reduction in the price.As regards post-war arrangements, we think it would be convenient to place a contract on an f.o.b. basis like the contracts dealing with other products. In any case the figure of 801 seems to us far too high for a. minimum if fixed for a period of ten years. We do not think it reasonable to guarantee a higher price than 551. or 601. f.o.b. But the future is so uncertain that in the interests of both parties it would seem desirable that either side should have the right in the case of both lead and copper to demand a revision of the price at the end of five years, and provision should be made in the original contract for a reference to arbitration in London if agreement is not reached between the parties. If this be done we should be prepared to assent to a minimum of 701. for the first five years.These minima may seem low to the Australians, but it must be remembered, as we have already pointed out, that the advantage of any copper contract to the United Kingdom is not evident.In any case, if the purchase be made it will be necessary to stipulate that at least one-half of the quantity should be delivered in the form of blister copper at a reduction in price to correspond with the charge for refining made by the refining plants in Australia. The refining industry in this country, which it is important to maintain, is gravely prejudiced by the embargo placed on the export of bar copper by the Commonwealth Government since the outbreak of war.5. We think, however, in regard to both these contracts that if the British Government is to take the risk of guaranteeing a minimum price it is entitled to participate in any advantage derived from sales at prices above the minimum, and we have made the above recommendations on this understanding. There is precedent for this in the case of wool, where the fixed minimum of 15^ is paid and the difference between that and the Bradford issue price (average 2s. 3d. per lb.), is divided between the Australian producers and the British Government.6. We have enquired whether such an arrangement with Australia as is here discussed would involve similar demands either in respect of the same or other commodities from other parts of the Empire. We are informed that it might be necessary to offer similar terms in respect of lead to producers in the United Kingdom, Burma, and Rhodesia, but that no other claims are to be anticipated.7. In deciding whether a contract should be made in the case of copper as well as lead, we feel that some consideration should be given to Mr. Hughes&apos;s contention that the series of transactions with the Australians must be regarded as a whole, and that any risks inherent in the copper and wheat contracts are, to some extent, counter-balanced by the advantageous terms on which we obtain wool, zinc concentrates, and lead.8. It should also be observed that the question of the copper and lead contracts is but a part of the major problem of securing control of raw materials after the war for our own industries, for the benefit of our Allies, and also as a means of exercising additional pressure on Germany, should that be necessary.Undoubtedly, if the control of raw materials is desired by His Majesty&apos;s Government for any such purposes it greatly strengthens the case for action in regard to these particular commodities.9. At this point, however, it is necessary to raise a word of caution. Considerable difficulties have already arisen with America out of the purchase of Australian wool. The original contract provided that wool for the use of the British army and navy was to be paid for by His Majesty&apos;s Government at the minimum price. All other wool was to be sold on the best terms obtainable or by a later agreement at Bradford issue prices-that is to say, at the price at which the wool is made available to British manu-facturers. This agreement was, however, subject to an arrangement with the French Government which gave them their military wools on the same terms as those supplied to the British army. A similar concession was temporarily in force with the Italian Government. The Americans have claimed that they are entitled to the same treat-ment, notwithstanding the fact that they are paying very much higher prices within the States for their own clip, and considerably more extravagant prices in the[973J 0
Argentine. They lay down the principle that it is for each Government to fix the price of commodities produced within its borders, but that every Government is entitled to call upon its Allies for supplies of commodities produced by them at the same price as they themselves pay. It has been found necessary to accept this principle in the case of wool, for it is obvious that if we refused we should shortly be confronted with a double list of prices for all commodities produced in America one being the price charged to the American Government and the other and higher price being fixed for supplies to ourselves.It will have been observed, however, that the wool contract leaves a considerable margin of profit on wools supplied for civilian purposes, whether to the home manufacturer or the allied Governments, and that this profit is divided between His Majestys Government and the Australian producer. No objection, as far as we know, has been raised to this arrangement by the American Government, but in contero-plating the extension of Government purchases to other commodities, and over a long period of time, we think it necessary to raise the question whether His Majesty&apos;s Government should be hound, or could refuse, after the war to furnish supplies to other countries on as favourable terms as to their own manufacturers. The only inducements to His Majesty&apos;s Government to undertake a class of transaction foreign to the traditions of the British Government, fra ught with considerable administrative difficulties, and involving considerable risks, are, first, the necessity of guaranteeing a supply to our own industry of the necessary quantity of the raw materials concerned, and, secondly, the obligations under which we lie to come to the relief in an emergency of other portions of the Empire, and to consolidate the interests of the Empire as a whole. These reasons may be sufficient to justify us in undertaking a bargain of the nature specified, but it would seem that there is no obligation on us after the war is over to run these possible risks and certain inconvenience for the benefit of the citizens of other countries, and that it would not be unreasonable that in respect of our undertaking them we should charge to other countries or their citizens a percentage in excess of the prices which we may consider it desirable to charge to our own citizens. In other words, we should retain the liberty of the Government which takes all the risk, which makes the bargain, and from whose territories the supplies are drawn, to give a preference to its own industry. His Majesty&apos;s Government will be in a better position than this Committee to say whether such a policy is desirable and possible, but we think it right to draw attention to the possible international complications which might arise from the share of the British Government in these transactions.If it be desired to reserve the right to dispose of the copper or lead below the world price either for the purpose of a preference to our own citizens or aiding the reconstruction of the devastated territories of our Allies, it would be necessary to make special provision for this in the contract with the Australian Government. We think that some liberty must be reserved to the British Government to meet such contingencies.10. Subject to these observations we recommend action on the lines indicated.AUSTEN CHAM BEKLALN, Chairman.J. M. KEYNES (Treasury).CECIL L.

APPENDIX.Memorandum supplied by the Board of Trade.Australian Lead./The Proposed Purchase of the Surplus Australian Lead Output.(A.) Committees recommending that the Purchase be effected.The Board of Trade Non-Ferrous Metals Committee, the Ministry of Reconstruction Non-Ferrous Metals Committee (Sub-Committee on Lead), and Mr. Walter Long&apos;s Committee have all reported in favour of a purchase by His Majesty&apos;s Government of the surplus output of Australian lead.The Board of Trade Non-Ferrous Metals Committee reported on the 13 th February, 1918, as follows : -&quot; In lead a world shortage has to be faced, but the position of the lead industry in this country may be practically assured by definitely securing the surplus Australian supply. The Committee has devoted much time to considering means by which this could be effected, and it is of opinion that direct purchase constitutes the most practical and certain method.&quot; The world shortage of lead discussed in the early portions of this report renders it essential in the opinion of the Committee that Empire supplies should be secured absolutely and definitely to this country. After very full consideration of the various methods directed to this end the Committee is convinced that it can be obtained only by a direct purchase of a large part of the Australian output.&quot;The Committee finally submitted a recommendation which reads as follows : &quot; That the Government should arrange to purchase from Australia for a period often years the whole of her surplus output of lead beyond that required for local consumption and the demands of her geographical markets. The price to be that realised on re-sale, but not less than the average of the London market price. t&quot; To the extent of 130,000 tons per annum, minima of 181. per ton net for good soft pig and 1-8Z. 10s. net for special ex ship London, to be guaranteed to the sellers, which minima shall be reconsidered at the end of five years by a joint representative board and readjusted if found necessary. The quality and quantity of special refined lead to be defined in the contract.&quot; This to be subject to the Commonwealth Government undertaking to arrange that the surplus over her own geographical requirements, not in any case being less than 65 per cent, of the total output of Australia during the whole period of the contract, shall be shipped to this country. The distribution of the purchased lead to be arranged by joint agreement with the sellers.&quot;The Sub-Committee on Lead appointed by the Ministry of Reconstruction reported on the 29th May, 1918, as follows :- &apos;&quot; The main source within the British Empire is one of the great producing . fields of the world, viz., Broken Hill in New South Wales, and the Committee urges that the scheme of purchase recommended by the Non-Ferrous Metals Committee should receive prompt consideration and if approved should be nego-tiated during the impending visit of Mr. Hughes to this country.&quot;The Committee on the Trade Relations of the United Kingdom within the Empire recommends &quot; that steps should be taken, by means of a purchase scheme, to secure for the use of the British Empire and its Allies the whole output of lead in Australia and Burma.&quot;These Committees recommend the course in question because they were convinced that a world shortage in lead has to be faced.   Being of opinion that the Australian lead producers will be able without question to sell their output, if not to this country * [973] D
to purchasers in other parts of the world, and bearing in mind the extreme importance of adequate supplies of lead to this country both for purposes of reconstruction and for normal industrial operation, they considered that the drastic measure recommended was justified in order to make certain of the national requirements.(B.) Expected World Shortage of Lead.The reasons which lead to the opinion that a lead shortage is inevitable may be summarised as follows : 1. A study of the statistics of the world&apos;s outputs of the common industrial metals, lead, zinc, copper, tin, pig iron, and aluminium shows that whereas the rate of increase in production of&apos; all these metals other than lead shows a marked increase, that &quot;of lead indicates a tendency to fall.2. During the early days of the war the value of primary lead in the United States (where the price was not controlled) rose by over 50 per cent., whereas the corresponding increase in output amounted to less than 4 per cent., an increase so small as to suggest restriction of available supplies and lead to the expectation of an actual reduction when prices tend to become more nearly normal. *3. During the war the demand for lead, particularly for making shrapnel, has been so great that stocks all over the world have disappeared. The major part of the lead used for war purposes may be regarded as non-recoverable. In the belligerent countries all building work and repairs excepting such as are absolutely necessary have been stopped or postponed, and the demand has been so great that miscellaneous stocks such as ballast for yachts have been commandeered. The use of pig lead for making white lead (one of the important lead-consuming industries of the country) was at one time prohibited, and even now, when we have no longer to supply the large requirements of Russia, the manufacture is drastically restricted. After the war not only will it be necessary to overtake the vast amount of repair work and building work which in this country will be essential,. but it will be necessary to assist in the reconstruction of Belgium and to allow the stocks necessary in normal industry to percolate back into their old places.4. Mexico, one of the foremost lead-producing countries in the world, has, by reason of the internal troubles in that country, been producing lead in recent years in quantities far below her normal output.5. The Non-Ferrous Metals Committee of the Board of Trade in particular foresees no probability of the immediate situation being eased by the discovery of new lead-bearing areas. In the past, when small quantities of metal were required metalliferous mining was carried out on small though very rich deposits; many of these are now exhausted. With the growth of engi-engineering knowledge not only did the demand for metals increase enormously, but the practicability of working large and comparatively poor or difficult areas was realised. These large areas must be worked on a large scale, and it is only such an area that could affect seriously a shortage such as that under consideration. Even assuming that a large deposit be discovered at once, the time which would be required for development to a stage giving a production is such as to rule the imaginary area out of the discussion during almost all of the period under consideration.Lead Production.--Roughly speaking, the world&apos;s production of lead in terms of metallic lead is 1,100,000 to 1,200,000 tons. Of this the United States produces approximately 375,000 tons, Spain 170,000 tons, Mexico in normal times about 110,000 to 120,000 tons, and Australia 217,000 tons. France, in addition to producing some 45,000 tons in domestic and North African ores, controls the Penarroya Company, the chief Spanish producer; and the United Kingdom production of some 30,000 tons of pig-lead is derived as to 20,000 tons annually from domestic ores.It should be noted that Burmah produces a lead ore of a type similar to that produced at Broken Hill, and although the present capacity is of the order of only about 20,000 tons per annum, a considerable increase must be expected in the future.* The American output of soft and desilverised lead from domestic and imported areas was in 1916 571,134 tons (worth, at average New York prices, 78,816,000 dollars). The corresponding- figures for 1915 were 550,055 tons (worth 51,705,000 dollars). Thus in 1916 the output increased hy about 3-8 per cent, on the previous year&apos;s figures, whereas the value increased 52&apos;4 per cent.
Before the war Australia produced domestic pig-lead equivalent to about half of her total production of lead in ore. The remainder was treated mainly in Belgium and in Germany. Belgium before the war produced some 50,000 tons of pig-lead annually with an output of lead in ore amounting to only, say, 70 tons, and&apos;Germany produced some 180,000 tons of pig-lead with an output of lead in ore totalling less than 80,000 tons.Lead Consumption.- The normal consumption of lead in the United Kingdom is of the order of 200,000 tons, and that of the remainder of the Empire some 35,000-40,000 tons. France consumes rather over 100,000 tons, Belgium some 40,000 tons, the United States 400,000 tons, and Germany and Austria approximately 250,000 tons; total 1,030,000 tons.The United States can meet the needs of her home consumption from domestic ores.   The export trade of that country was dependent upon imported Mexican lead.The United Kingdom normally obtains lead from Mexico, but for reasons already stated supplies from this source have fallen off. Further, enemy activities in that country have been such that certain sources once available will probably be closed to British importers in the future.o
