The International Status of Belgium after the Ware&apos; A question of such.vital importance to Belgium hasa.vt-urhlly been the subject of much discussion in the Belgianpress and elsewhere during the past four years - particularlyin connection with the various indications given by GermanMinisters and publicists of German wishes and intentions withregard to the future of Belgium,     Arguments have been mar-shalled for and against Neutrality but the really determiningforces underlying the controversy have been (l) dread andhatred of the Germans:    (2) fears for the economic future ofBelgium and uncertainty as to the extent to which the allies will be able and willing to undertake the financing ofBelgium&apos;s economic restoration.     It will not be far fromthe truth to say that those sections of Belgian public opin-ion in which the former feeling predominates range themselves against any renewal of neutrality, while those with whom thesecond is the stronger motive are in favour of it.The arguments for and against neutrality have recentlybeen presented with great ability and competence by twoprominent Belgians - the author of a pamphlet which has ,recently been circulated in typed copies among Belgianrefugees., who remains anonymous but is believed to be M*xCarton de Viart, and Baron Bey ens who presents the case against neutrality, in the Revue des deux Mondos of July 1st and Sept* 1st of this year.x   See Kr, Kearney&apos;s Memorandum. Belgian Trade Committee Miscc   00115.
The Pamphlet.The author of the pamphlet begins by meeting three objections commonly raised against Guaranteed Neutrality, viz. (1) that it created a false sense of security and weakened the growth of national feeling:    (2) that it hampered the external action of the Government:    (3) that it was an artificial and illusory protection,In answer to tho first objection he points out that military efficiency was not wholly neglected:   that since all democratic nations were anti-militarist,. Belgian pacifism cannot be wholly put down to her status of Guaranteed Neutrality:   that the mag-nificent resistance of Belgium during the past four years sufficiently proves that national feeling has not been undermined,,In regard to objection No. 2 he. contends that freer action.-at least in the Commercial sphere and possibly also in the form of a defensive alliance with Holland - would not have been in-compatible with Neutrality and that the fault lay with the timidity of the Government.    Neutrality moreover did not prevent the establishment of the Belgian Congo State.As to the third objection there is nothing disconcerting in the fact that it was one&apos; of the guarantors who violated Belgium&apos;s Neutrality.     The arrangement was designed to meet that very case*     Moreover Guaranteed Neutrality worked well in 1870 and as well as could be expected in 1914.     It determined the immediate intervention of Dnglande     Complemented by.the re-covery of Luxembourg and corrections of the frontier on the side of Prussia. .-.nd Holland, it would be still more effective.He goes on to consider the alternatives to a Guaranteed Neutrality-     These are;-1*     Full independence and state Sovereignty^     This would &apos; probably entail a policy of Alliances and of Alliances with

It determined the immediate intervention of England..  - Complemented by the re-eovery of Luxembourg and corrections of the frontier on the side of Prussia .-.nd Holland, it would be still more effective.He goes on to consider the alternatives to a Guaranteed Neutrality.    These are:-lo     Full independence and State Sovereignty^     This would probably entail a policy of Alliances and of Alliances with
much stronger Powers.    Under existing circumstances only Alliance vrith the Entente powers can be contera lated,     Such an Alliance would divide the country into opposed factions.    Moreover if a split should presently occur among the entente powers, Belgium would &quot;be placed in a very difficult position.     In any case an overwhelming burden of military preparation would be imposed upon her.     A non-Neutral Belgium would be the object of the most aggressive ill-will from Germany who v/ould always bo suspecting her of becoming the instrument of Germany&apos;s enemies.2*     If Neutrality without guarantees were spontaneously adopted, Belgium would bo in the position of having the obliga-tions but not the rights (to protection) conferred by a Guaranteed Neutrality.     She would also be exposed to embarrassing solid-tations from one or other neighbouring pc-er, anxious to draw her into its orbit.Belgium, he concludes, must necessarily be neutral and the only form, of neutrality consistent alike with security and with her self-respect and freedom of development is a Neutrality -guaranteed by the Powers, including Italy and the United States, or perhaps by the much talked of Society of Nations.    (&quot;Though we need not&quot;, he rather naively says, &quot;exaggerate the influence which these international arrangements are likely to have on the peace of the world, we should got out of them all the advantage we can,&quot;)To those who affirm that France and ingland would never con-sent to&apos; a restoration of the status quo but would insist on Belgium severing all connection with Germany - even such a tie as v/ould be constituted by the admission of Germany to be a co-guarantor of Belgian neutrality - he replies that, apart from the fact that Belgium has by her conduct earned the right to be completely trusted and to be placed above suspicion of any leanings towards a German connection, the Allies must on reflection .aee &quot;that
- m    4;   &quot;**their interest and that of Mr one an peace  will he &quot;better served by a neutral Belgium, perpetually exposed to tho influence of the Great Power s*&quot;Finally the author deals with the real gravamen of the objections to a return to the status quo - the acceptance of Germany as a c-OTguarantor for Belgian neutrality.     TO this, he admits, the sentiment of all good Belgians will be very strongly opposed.    But Germany, he points out, v/ill in any case have to sign the actual Treaty of Peace, and a Neutrality guaranteed by certain Powers against certain other Powers would be contrary to the spirit of Neutrality,    Moreover the prospect of being ad-mitted as a guarantor would make it easier for Germany to retraot in the Peace Congress the charges of non^neutral conduct levelled against Belgium and to acknowledge formally, that Belgium&apos;s ob* servance of neutrality has been irreproachable.     Such a volun-tary confession of error - and the author does not believe in the power of the Allies to force Germany to such a humiliation -would also facilitate the admission of Germany to the Society of Nations.     If, he says, we could be sure of being able to crush Germany we need take little account of her wishes or fears, but, if there is some doubt on the subject,compromise and conciliation of interests .is inevitable.     Germany&apos;s desire for Belgian neu-trality is no good reason for Belgium&apos;s rejection of Neutrality. Bar on B eyen1 a Art i ole.In his article of July 1st in the Revue des deux Mondes, Baron Beyens presents the case against a return to Guaranteed Neutrality.     His arguments are mainly those which the pamphlet is intended to refute.    They are briefly as follows:&apos;&quot;The alleged advantages of Guaranteed Neutrality are illuscry. Militarily.     In 1870 Belgium&apos;s immunity was due not to theGuarantee but to French and German dread of British
intervention which would have taken place8 if Belgium had been threatened, irrespectively of the Treaty of 1839.In 1914 Great Britain,-as Lichnowsky testifies, would have in any case have intervened in defence of France and a fortiori of Belgium.. Belgium would, in fact,-, have been in a better position without the Guarantees, since in that case she would have been prepared for self-defence. France also would in any case have intervened since the menace to Belgium was equally a menace to her-self.i Economically. Belgian commercial success in countries like China,Mexico, Brazil, etc, which were unaffected by her neutral status show that her achievements were dueI to her own merits net to her Neutrality.Its disadvantages were undeniable.!        (l)   it created a false sense of security and made the Belgian people unwilling to make sacrifices for the sake of military I security.(2) . By virtually putting Belgium under tutelage it diminish-j ished her in comparison with other Secondary States - Switzerland .   e.g*, whose neutrality was voluntarily adopted though afterwards recognised and guaranteed by the Powers in 1815.     Belgian Neutrality, being a diminution of Sovereignty imposed by the Great Powers from benevolent but egoistic motives, condemned Belgium to permanent isolation.,   In spite of the manifest menace from Germany she did not conclude any precautionary alliance with France and England although the law of Nations allows Neutrals to make igfen.si.ve alliances.   But for the status imposed upon her, Belgium
r 6 *&quot; ywould have secured herself &quot;by a triple line of military convention-tiong and reinsurances,(3)   It created economic disabilities - made it impossible for Belgium to contract a Customs Union with one of her Guarantors (in Louis Philippe&apos;s time e.g,, a proposal for Customs Union with i^rance was opposed by Great Britain) and precluded her - in practice if not in law - from making a Tariff War.Belgian neutrality a German Interest.A return to the Status quo ante * to a Neutrality guaranteedwwn :*frtG:j m\!tmmmmmim*MMnw*by all the Great Powers, Russia being replaced by Italy; theUnited States and Japan, is what certain Germans desire as apis ^lleri failing annexation ** their first choice - or a dis-armed neutrality - for that is what the official commentators onthe obscure utterances of the various Imperial Chancellors reallymean when they talk of guarantees&apos;.    But Neutrality&quot; officfially guaranteed on paper would, unless general disarmament hadushered   in a New Age or some unexpected miracle had transformed,,,the German mentality, be for many Belgians nothing but.the ab-sence of security.     Recent experience shows that the coupling ofieutrali^y v*ith Guarantees is self**destruction qince it makes it .Impossible for any Guarantor to provide help in time.A return to the ajatus quo of 1839 would open the door toerp-etual interference by Germany in the internal, affairs,.ofelgium.    Patriotic Commemorations of the Y/ar,. saluting ofHied powers&apos;, Flags, singing of the karseilles,,. etc., wouldrovide endless occasions for recriminations - an intolerabletate of things for, Belgium. --:,,(&apos;. &apos;     . &apos; &apos; : &apos;      ;     &apos; Io ask Belgium to. return to a .state of tutelage would be an insult.By &apos;its /heroic resistance the Belgian people has&apos; earned- the &apos;;&apos;fight to. complete independence&apos;vis a vis the other nations v/ithout
M     7     *reserves or limitat ion.Role of the Belgian Government at       peace CongreflBiAt the Peace Congress the Belgian Government, in accord with France and Iftgland, should denounoe the neutrality clauses of the .. 3.830 Treaty;   should claim for Belgium the absolute right to fix her mm -international statue:   should declare that be.belgium desires only peace and security in order to heal the wounds inflicted on her and intends to pursue the same straightforward policy towards all nations she followed &quot;before the war*It will then be for the Belgian people to decide through its Parliament for or against a spontaneous neutrality.It will be noted that the neutralist and the anti-Neutrallet proceed on the assumption (1) that no complete defeat of Germany i3 ^expected and (2) that the League of Natifittfl will, if realised at all, be of slight practical efficiency as a protection for small states.But while Baron Beyens&apos;shows an absolute disbelief in a Germany transformed either from within or from without and an utter abhorrence from amy connection with Germany after the war, the author of the pamphlet, though perhaps equally sceptical about the future attitude of Germany, is for practical reasons prepared, on certain terms, to compromise and even inclined te smooth the way fo:? the resumption of pre-war relations with the enemy.If the one writer is too much under the influence of vindictive feeling ** too much obeeesed by more than justifiable hatred and fear of German aggressiveness to take a balanced view, the other ig almost too cool and too exclusively concerned for&apos; the economic future of his country.Accordingly their arguments are of more value and interest ... as representing tha two. currents of fooling&apos; tsnticg. Belgians
*t Q mr^i^th^rqae^tLoa of their future status than as helps to a sound w and objective judgement. on the subject.The author of the ptmphlet, representing, it seems, a strong group of oGsnmeroial interests, anxious primarily about the economic future of his country and doubting the will w tho power of the Allies to ensure it, advooatoa a return tc the status quo, as a means- te resumption itf relations, with Germany.- -,   nationalist. oM in the Entente sense, Orthodox&apos; Belgians, whosefeelings are &quot;red?looted in Baron Beyeast article, deeply horrified by the revelation of German barbarism and ru-thleasness, desire, tr see Belgium free to. provide itself with effective . protection, whioh for them seane only to be attainable by allianoe &apos; with France&quot;ana^iand.    They naturally denounoe the views of the pamphlet as&apos;^defeatist1 in tendency and appeal to the feel-inge of hairea and resentment whioh Germany&apos;s conduct has eov. plentifully propagated in Belgium.Baron Bayous, whose article on the Neutrality question is une of a series headed &quot; &quot;Avenir des Betits iltats1 , plainly reoognisee that the question is only part of a muoh larger one.It is in this light that we should consider it, giving due weight to - the just claims of Belgium but not allowing ourselves te be too much influenced by the passionate feelings whioh are natural and excusable in Belgians.to main aim in this war has come to be the *civilisation&apos; of International relations by the oreatien of an Inter-State authority.flew if the conclusion of peaoe is te leave Iftirope in the condition contemplated by Baron Beyens - divided, that is to say, inte two irreconcilably hostile groups of States - this ideal f*r which, we have fought will have to be abandoned.    It will be impossible far the Entente powers in their handling of inters national problems to remain faithful to their proclaimed prin-&apos; oiples.     They will be&apos; forced, willy-nilly, to make their cs*ali-tl3n as strong as possible.     They will not be in a position to be
generous or to leave it to the smeller states to fix their own status and choose their own friends.     V/e should, for instance, have to use all possible pressure in order to tie Belgium to our interests.If on the other hand we feel able to count on the creation at the Peace Congress of an. Inter-State Authority., at least as-effectJve as the old Balance of Power arrangements in assuring the., safety, of i ^mall St at ea^; we can. safely remain loyal, to the principle of !Self ^Determination&apos; and leave the Belgian people to denounce its Guaranteed neutrality, and adhere, a3 it cer-tainly \70uld, to the League of Nations.    The Neutrality of each State being guaranteed by all collectively) ho special guarantees would be any longer required:   and all being Virtually Allies) no alliances betv/een particular powers would Ue necessary or per-..&apos; missible.-    It is clear, however, that a League of Nations which did not include the present enemy States would not&apos;provide a sufficient guarantee of security, and equally clear that until those States have undergone an ethical and politice.1 regeneration&apos; they cannot be admitted to a partnership vowed to uphold Right against Might,All th^f- can be said at present^is that recent events do make it possible to hope for a transformation of Germany and thereby bring nearer to realisation a League of Nations and the super-annuation of such imperfect devices as Guaranteed Neutrality, Alliances and Reinsurances.It will be time enough to decide the question of Belgium1s Status when the Belgian people is once more able to express its will through its Parliament and meanwhile the question should not be prejudiced by any arrangement between Governments.&apos;
