Increase of With reference to the 34th Meeting of the Committee,Pay to Minute 6 (taper No. 98), the Committee- had under con-Soldiers &amp;   sideration the revised War Office scheme for payment Sailors.      of Gratuities to Warrant Officers, Non-commissioned officers and Men on Demobilisation (paper No. 99) and a Memorandum from the Air Ministry on the same subject (paper No. 100).&apos;   MR. BARNES said that after reconsidering this question since the last meeting he had come to the conclusion that the proposed rates a3 shown in the War Office scale were rather too low.   Mr. Barnes reminded the Committee that it had been authorised by the prime Minister to deal with the question of -increased pay, but the Committee had decided that in view of the present circumstances this was an inappropriate method of dealing with the matter; at the same time it would not have been possible to have recommended a smaller increase than 6d. a day   , and therefore he was cf opinion the gratuity to be paid should approximate to that amount.   To give a man who had&apos;done a few months service at the end of the war  5 was out of all proportion to giving a man who had done five years service  17.   At the same time to work on the same lines as the officers&apos; gratuity would /
o&quot;  c  -not &quot;be satisfactory as this would give 124 days pay for the first year of service and enly 62 days pay for the subsequent yearn.     It v/;?s true that the soldier on dis-charge would get his 28 days pay and. ration allowance together with Separation Allowance, if -his dependants were entitled to it, for four weeks, but this equally was going to apply to munition workers *1:11. BARNES suggested that the gratuity should be increased at the rate of 10/- a month commencing with the second year but that a maximum cf five years service should be laid down,MR, STANLEY BA1.UT.IJN agreed that nothing was more deserving than, the payment of gratuity to the men who had served but pointed out that it must be remembered that the payment of a large sum of money on discharge would moan an increase in the purchasing power of money and consequently an increase in the prioe of commodities; as, however, demobilisation would be spread over a long period this might not have very serious results,MR. FORSTER agreed that an increase on the ScaiLe was desirable and reminded the Committee that the Gratuity would be paid to all old Regulars discharged unfit for service and would be given to the estates of all those who had been killed.     He thought it was desirable that differentiation should be made between men who had never served overseas and those who had .and suggested that the scale as laid down in the paper now before the Committee (paper No-.99) should apply to men who had been on continuous Home Service,  and that an increased addition of 10/- a month commencing from the second year should apply to any man who had during the war served overseas.   It was alsl most desirable that the basis of  5 for the first year&apos;s service 3hculd net be payable, to a man who had been on continual Home Service unless he had served for at least six months; this should not, however, apply to any man who had served overseas *     There was a further consideration, namely, that the payment of this gratuity must stop at the end of the &apos;v7ar, that date to be the day which was to be defined by law and that if men were held or a further period after that date,  special arrangements should be made.     The war Offioc would have to cansider the rate of the Officers&apos; Gratuity, the lowest of which could not, if those proposals were accepted, be put lower than that of a &quot;Warrant Officer,    and in this connection Mr, Porster reminded the Committee of the large number of officers for whom provision would have to be made, there being at the present time some 10,000 officers hoM-ing Regular Commissions who were brrne extra to establish&quot; merit,     The Gratuity to Officers would be paid whether they remained -in the service or not.*   .DR. MCNAV.ARA
1.o **DR. MACNAMARA agreed with the proposed inoreuees, and with regard to the time limit of qualification of men who had net served overseas said, that subject to the concurrence of the hoard of the Admiralty, he would suggest that no man in the.Navy should receive payment for the first year1s service who had done less thun six months in   a   Home Depot and no other service;   while agreeing to the scheme, Dr. Macnamara still was of opinion that the men would be treated in a similar way to the Officers as re-gards gratuities, so that it could not be said that the officers had received in any way, preferential tr .atment to the men.     Whatever the Committee decided should be announced as soon as possible.   The Admiralty had some 200,000 men    engaged for hostilities only to &apos; whom this gratuity would be ;ayable, all expecting to get home soon; this, of course, -would not be possible and it would be necessary for the national safety that they should remain mobilised for a considerable period,SIR ARTHUR BOSCAIYEN in agreeing with the proposals put forward said that the plan on which Officers1 Gratuities was payable was a very crude one and had only been designed after the South African V,rar in order to meet the cases of officers belonging to the Militia and Volunteers who had served in that war.MR. BLAND speaking on behalf of the Air Ministry, agreed with the proposals which had. been put forward, and stated that the effect, as regards the estimate which was shown in the Memorandum from the Ministry (Paper So, 100) would be that the total of  3,640,000 would be increased to about  4,500,000.MR. FOhSTER reminded the Committee that men on long service engagements who were entitled to  1 a year on discharge would receive that gratuity in addition to the gratuity now proposed.THE COMMITTEE decided:-(a)    That a W9r Gratuity (including gratuities due on discharge under the Pay Warrant) should be paid on Demobilisation to all Warrant Officers, Non-Commissioned Officers-and men in the Army and R.A.P. who had served overseas on a basis of  5 for a Private in his first year of service with an addition of 10/^ n month for each subsequent month of service or part of a month commencing with the second year, fixed additions for rank, as shown on Paper No. 101 attached.)
(bj   That the Gratuity payable under \a) should be limited to a maximum cf five years&apos; service,(o)   That a War Gratuity (includinggratuities on discharge due under the lay Warrant) should be payable on demobilisation tc all Warrant Officers, lion-Commissioned Officers and ken of the Army and R.A.F., who had not nerved everoeas at any period during their service on a basis of  5 for a Private in his first year of service with an addition of 5/- a month for each subsequent month or part cf a month commencing with the second year with fixed additions for rank (as shewn in Paper Ho,101 attached), but that only tho present service gratuity due under the Pay \7arrant should be paid for the first year of service unless tho Warrant Officer, Non-Commissioned Officer cr Man had completed at least six months service in the Army or RiA.l\(d) That the Gratuity under (o)&apos; should be limited to 5 years service.(e) That the calculation for the payment of these gratuities should ceaseat the end of the war, that date being defined by Statutory Authority and that special arrangements should be made for men hold to serve after that date.(f) No gratuity should be paid to Conscientious Objectors.(g) That the time during which a sr-ldier has worked for full civil wages   as a munition worker &amp;.c.,; should not count in assessment.(h) That in the case of a deserter all time previous to desertion should be ignored in assessment.(.i)   That with regard to imprisonment, periods of 28 days and over should . be. deducted in assessment,(j)   That the case of the Navy should be considered separately and that the Financial Secretary to the Admiralty should forward for the -consideration of the Committee at the earliest possible date, a . Memorandum putting forward fullya scheme
-3-

a scheme for the payment of the approximate amount of money due to the Royal Navy under the above proposals.

Gratuities to ? are ? service Pensions concurrently with pay. ? pointed out that his scheme suggested that soldiers who have been drawing pensions concurrently with pay should get the gratuity at reduced rates as is the case with officers recalled to ?ervice, who were only entitled to 31 days pay for each year of service on ?.

THE COMMITTEE decided :-

That a ar? Gratuity (including gratuities on discharge under the pay ?arrant) should be payable on demobilisation to all ?arrant Offcers. Non-Commissioned Officers and ?en of the Army and R.?F., who had drawn service Pensions concurrently with pay, on the basis f 35 for a Private in his first year of service with an addition of 2/6 a month for each subsquent month or part of a month commencing with the second year for all men who had not served overseas and a s?ilar addition of 5/- a month or part of a month for all men who had during any period of thier service served overseas.

?Naval Prize Money. ? raised the question as to the payment by the admiralty of Naval Prize Money in addition to the payment of the gratuities agreed upon, and asked whether the ships included in accordance with the ?rmistice arrived at with Germany would be assessed in value and included in the prize money. Mr. Forster said he must enter a caveat against this payment of Prize Money and Gratuity by the Navy.

? Said he considered it of the ?rmistice which might ? into our possession Warships and merchant ships should not be brought into prize money, as they were not taken by force. ?ith ? to other Prize Money, he reminded the Committee that a man must be 30 months at sea before he was entitled to a full share, and in all probability the Prize Money which would be due to an able ?eaman according to the ? agreed upon would not exceed ?5. This Prize Money was an award to the Navy made by the ? and the ? of admiralty hold strongly to the opinion that its distribution should have no effect on any payment of Gratuity.

? pointed out that "batta" money for the army, which would be included in the propsoed gratuities, was practically army Prize Money, and asked whether Prize Money and gratuity was paid by the admiralty for the ?outh African ar.


Announcement as to the Gratuities for Army and R.A.F.the Financial Secretary to the Admiralty, when putting forward the Memorandum asked for in Minute 2, should deal fully with this question and inform the Committee as to the procedure adopted with regard to the payment of Prize koney and Gratuities In former wars.&apos;T&apos;ixi    CHAIRMw undertook to interview the Prime Minister on the following day, in order that an announcement with regard to the Gratuities to be paid to the Royal liavy, Army and R.A.F. should be made at the earliest opportunity.THBi SECRETARY was instructed to call a further meeting on receipt of the Memorandum to sbe forwarded by the Financial Secretary to the Admiralty.2, Whitehall Gardens, S/a 12th flfovember, 1918,DR, MACNAIviARA said that he was not certain on this point but would have enquiries made.THE COwidlTl-Jiii decided
