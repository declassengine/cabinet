As regards (a), I think&quot;the time has already arrived when wc arc justified in transferring three Canol Night Fighting Squadrons to France for duty as Day Fighters *There have been no raids on this countrynow since May, and, though undoubtedly the onony has machines which&quot; are oapablo of reaching England from basoc in the East of Belgium he would be open to attack by our Night Fighting Squadrons in Belgium which really form the advanced Anti-Aircraft Defence of this country.In my opinion, the best protection against raids on England is to press the eneny in Franoc unremittingly and with all our strength, but should he attempt such raids, I consider that tho Hight Fighting Squadrons in Belgium, together with the 12 squadrons remaining in England arc a sufficient insurance.
3^     As regards (b) the War Cabinet have already given coveringsanction for taxing all preliminary measures for moving all available machines from England to France, and I. recommend thatthis be effected in two stages :-(1) by sending out five more Squadrons, at the discretion of the Army Council, leaving, seven at home;subsequently(2) by sending out the remaining seven,when the situation is held to justify such action, for which -formal sanction will be obtained,40     Approval of the following proposals is therefore requested: (a) To send three Camel Squadrons to France at once0- (b) To send five more Squadrons, at some future date to be decided by the Army Council and Air Council in consultation,,(c) To send the remaining seven Squadrons, when the War Cabinet shall so decide,(Sdfl)   P, de Bu Radcliffe,Major-General,D ,M,0t) for General,C a I e Go Ss6th November, 1918,

UTILISATION OF 6th BHT.Gx.Dhi.jlr,    .&apos;.&apos;.&apos;ith reference to Air Ministry &quot;Scheme for Utilisation if th   6th Brigade for purposes other than Home Defence&quot; forwarded o the War Office through the Liaison Officer, War Office, on the nd October, 1918, I am commanded by the Air Council to forward he attached &quot;Appreciation of the Probability of Raids by Hostile irxjraft cn London&quot; to the Amy Council, and to ask that the Allowing suggestions may receive favourable consideration *.2, In view of the improbability of a renewal of Raids onhgland by Hostile Aircraft, it is considered that when the editions stated below have matured, the aerial defences of London ihould be reduced by the withdrawal of 3 Camel Night Fighter Squadrons, which should then be transferred to co-operate with the british Armies in France&amp; where they would operate as Day Fighter Squadrons *3. I am commanded further to point out, for the informationif the Array Council, that the reduction would leave 12 Squadrons n England for the,purposes of Home Defence, which would consist of4 Camel cr Snipe Squadrons *1 Bristol Fighter or Snipe Squadron.)7 Avro Squadrons ciccording to the state of re-equipment of Squadrons at the time.4. The conditions which it is suggested should eventuate andiecide when the aforementioned Squadrons should be withdrawn from iiglandj are, either(a) that the enemy should have retired to a line running; approximately North and South through or in the immediate vicinity of Antwerp(b) that in the opinion of the Army Council a state of demoralisation should have developed in the enemy ranks which would justify such action being taken.I am,Sir,Your obedient Servant, (Sd.)

Appendix &quot;o&quot;. .APPRECIATION OP THE PROBABILITY OF RAIDS BY HOSTILEAIRCRAFT ON LONDON.1. Owing to the successful advance which has been and isbeing made by the Allied Armies on the Western Front, the enemy has found it necessary to withdraw his Aerodromes a considerable distance.The Squadrons whose duty it was to carry out Raids on England, which were originally stationed near Ghent are now reported to be In the vicinity of Antwerp.2, The fact that the whole of the Belgian Coast has been abandoned by the enemy leaves him three alternatives from which to choose if he wishes to carry out a raid on England.(a) To violate Dutch neutrality by flying over her territory.(b) To fly over our lines and the belt of land be-tween our lines and the sea coast.(c) To carry out the raid with Lighter-than-Aircraft.3.&apos; It is not considered probable that the enemy will violate&apos;Dutch neutrality, for the very obvious reason that it would give us the excuse of following his example, by doing which a very advantag-Carbonaceous and easy route to his large manufacturing centres in the region Of Essen would be thrown open to us.Moreover, the enemy must be fully aware that we have in, preparation a large programme of long distance bombing machines and since he is thoroughly alive to the difficulties of long-distance night flying, it is considered most improbable that he will voluntarily minimise these difficulties by giving us the iead.: 4, During recent months the enemy has sustained very heavylc-sses among his night bombing machines through the action of our Night Fighting Squadrons.-,Should he decide, to carry out raids on England, then he is confronted, with the problem of avoiding Dutch territory, and of crossing our lines in a comparatively narrow sector in the Flanders
region, which, provided we have the means, can be very efficiently defended by us.Further, the consideration which must weight heavily with him is, that not only has he to cross our linos on the outward journey, but must recross them on the homeward trip, during which time we shall not only know his approximate whereabouts, but also the exact time when we may expect h:lm05*     For several months past Germany has confined herself to bombing our back areas in France, in preference to bombing Englando    rfhile a successful advance is in progress, the greatest effect can be produced by bombing important centres on lines of communicationsb   Successful raids on these points may seriously affect a victorious advance, owing to the disorganisation of the supply system caused thereby, and the possible hindrance to the movement of troops in reserve, and we may anticipate therefore that the enemy will concentrate all his efforts on harrying us to the fullest extent on the above linest 60     The enemy&apos;s air service is at the present moment considerably under establishment in machines, his wastage is extravagant and his output cannot hope to meet demands.This being so, it is for consideration whether he will-risk losing a number of machines which he can ill afford, in order to carry out a mission which, even if successful, would achieve results of little military importance, and moreover at a time when it is vitally important to him to concentrate on military objectives.7.     In opposition to the foregoing, it must be realised however that it would be possible to bomb England from bases situated still further to the East than Antwerp, and as the range of aircraft is steadily increasing, it may be accepted that considerations of distance alone will not form serious obstacles to carrying out raids on Great Britain.It is probable that the very&apos; effective defences of
London have been a determining factor in Germany^ policy, and it must be presumed that any withdrawal from our defensive unit3 would scon become known to the enemy, who might under those circumstances be tempted, to renew his raiding activities.Consideration must also be given to the fact that the enemy must be fully aware that labour unrest is in a more or less quiescent state, and might hope therefore to awaken it by means of bombing.    Further^&apos;the question must he weighed of lowering the moral of the British public, at a time when feelers for peace are being extended, with the hope thereby of making them readier to acquiesoe in German suggestions.     Probably the strongest argument in favour of a resumption of raids by hostile aircraft on England will be found in the desire which must exist in the mind of the German High Command to be able to produce something in the nature of a successful operation, wi&amp;b. which to recussltate the fading moral of the German public,0. With regard to lighter-than-air craft, the enemy has forsome months past used these exclusively for reconnaissance work vuith his sea forces.     During his last raids on England, carried out by Zeppelins, his losses were so heavy in proportion to the strength employed that it appears probable that he will not consider it sound policy to attempt to repeat this method of attack, so long as there is still a formidable Home Defence Force in England.Further, in view of having relinguished his aeroplane bases on the sea coast from which to carry out reconnaissances towards our shores, he will have to rely almost entirely on his llghter-than-air craft to keep him informed as far as possible of the movements of our naval forces in the Channel area,,and it is considered improbable therefore that, he will be in a position to spare them for other purposes than reconnaissance. 9, To sum up the situation briefly, it is admitted thatthere are arguments both for and against the probability of further
raids by aircraft on England, and while it is agreed that the possibility will always exist, weighing one point against another, it is considered that the balance is in favour of a non-repitition of this form of attack.    Nevertheless, it is obvious that so long as the&apos;possibility exists, it is out of the question to give a positive guarantee.F.O0I.  7710c18.
