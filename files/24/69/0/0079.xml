Interim Report by the Demobilisation Committee to the War Cabinet.THIS Committee, which, was appointed by the War Cabinet on the 30th October, 1918 (War Cabinet 493, Minute 8), to dispose of Demobilisation questions, has had before it a number of Reconstruction Schemes which have been examined from the standpoint of the labour they could absorb in the near future. The Committee has not considered the financial soundness or otherwise of these schemes nor their relation to the general post-war financial policy of the Government.I. Housing and Public Works,These subjects are still under consideration, and it is hoped to bring forward proposals in a few days.II. Roads.Any substantial programme of road repair and development is primarily governed by finance, and it is essential that Treasury sanction should be obtained if any road reconstruction scheme is to be carried out on an adequate scale.We had before us a programme approved by the Road Board involving the following expenditure spread over from five to ten years :  (a.) Deferred maintenance (work to be spread over three years)       ..    30,000,000 (b.) Special reconstruction (work to be spread over five years)        ..    33,000,000 (c.) Bridges (work to be spread over ten years)   .. ..        ..      9,000,000*(d.) Widenings and new roads .. .. .. .. ..     10,000,000(e.) Central organisation .. .. .. .. ..      2,000,000Total ........    84,000,000This scheme can be put into operation at once, and the following estimate for the first year&apos;s expenditure has been prepared :  Deferred maintenance .. .. .. .. .. ..     12,000,000Special reconstruction .. .. .. .. ..        . .     15,000,000Bridges       .. .. ..-        .. .. ..        ..      2,000,000Central organisation   .. .. .. .. .. ..      1,000,000Total .... ..        ..    30,000,000Of the sum set down for deferred maintenance, it was estimated that the Local Authorities had in hand 6,000,000L The Government would thus have to provide the remaining 24,000,0001. The Local Authorities are strongly opposed to any sudden rise in the road rates, and it would be necessary for the State to advance loans, repayable over a number of years, and to bear some, if not most, of the expenditure entirely out of State funds. Some portion of the burden could probably be transferred by taxation to motorists and the users of heavy vehicles.This scheme is capable of absorbing during the first year 150,000 men over and above those at present at work on the roads. Much of the necessary plant for executing this programme is at present in France, as are also the pivotal men who would be required.* This is a purely hypothetical figure, and we have omitted any provision under this head.

A minor public improvement which would absorb some unskilled labour may be mentioned here the clearance of waterways and ditches. We understand that the occupiers of the land are nominally responsible for carrying out this work, but they seldom do it. Some County Councils would be prepared tc carry out this work, provided they were allowed to charge the cost to the owners of the land.We make the following recommendations : (1) That the road programme as outlined above be approved and put in hand at once.(2) That the Road Board be requested to enter into negotiations with the Highway Authorities.(3) That the Army Council be asked to release the Director of Roads, with such pivotal men -and materials as may be necessary to set going the above programme.III. Canals.There are various schemes in existence for the improvement of canals which could be put into operation in about three months&apos; time, but apparently an expenditure of 800,0001 would lead to the employment of only between 3,000 and 4,000 men. In view of the smallness of this number and the large financial outlay, we make no recom-mendation on this head.IV. Land Reclamation and Main Drainage Schemes.The Secretary of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries estimates that there are at least 200,000 acres of reclaimable land in England and Wales, and that, allowing for collateral employments, the work of reclaiming this area would employ one man per acre during the first season, and subsequently permanent employment could be found at the rate of about three men per hundred acres. Surveys of some important areas are in hand, and the work could therefore be begun within a week of sanction being obtained. Housing accommodation would be required, and might be furnished from surplus War Office hutments.The one outstanding obstacle which must be surmounted before this scheme can be put into operation is the lack of compulsory powers for the occupation of the land by the State.As it would take time to obtain new powers at present to enter upon and acquire land, it is suggested that suitable land be acquired under the Development Act. In order to obtain early possession in anticipation of the purchase, the Board of Agriculture would enter under the Defence of the Realm Regulations 2 M. Compensation in respect of the temporary occupation would be dealt with under the Corn Production Amend-ment Act, and in respect of the purchase under the Development Act. A necessary feature of this method of procedure would be that the 1,000,0001. required for reclamation should be assigned to the Development Commissioners. An advantage of this pro-cedure is that no legislation will be required and that no question of the allocation of the money as between England, Scotland, and Wales would arise since the Development Commissioners deal indifferently with the three countries.Certain main drainage schemes could also be developed in a short time which would absorb a considerable amount of unskilled labour, and would be more economical to the State than land reclamation. The Drainage Act which passed last Session gave power to the Board of Agriculture, in default of action by the local authorities, to put in hand small drainage schemes, but did not give the Board power to deal with large schemes.   This Bill should be amended.We recommend : 1. That all necessary facilities be given to the Board of Agriculture and the Development Commission for the immediate occupation of land suitable for reclamation.2. That the War Cabinet be asked to approve the reclamation proposals of Sir George Cave&apos;s Committee on Land Settlement (G.-225, paragraph 17), and to sanction the allocation by the Treasury of 1,000,000Z. to the Development Commissioners in order to give immediate effect to the proposals.3. That steps be taken to amend the Land Drainage Act, 1918, so as to enable the Board of Agriculture to undertake large drainage works.4. That the Board of Agriculture, in consultation with the Development Corn-mission, be made the Executive Authority for the scheme.
V. Afforestation and Timber Supply.The interim authority for afforestation is only now being set up, and it is not anticipated that sufficient progress can be made with afforestation schemes to absorb much demobilised labour in the near future. The Timber Controllers Department is available for the supply of a certain number of forestry officers, and the one or two woodmen&apos;s schools now in existence can easily be multiplied for the training of the subordinate staff required.Some 16,000 men are at present engaged on timber production. Nearly one-half of these are Canadians, and the remainder include Portuguese, Finns, and German prisoners. With the exception of a few pivotal men, almost the whole of this number could be discharged in a short space of time to make room for demobilised soldiers. In addition to the above, the timber trade could absorb about 2,000 men.We recommend That the Timber Controller should arrange with the appropriate departments for the gradual absorption of suitable demobilised soldiers as soon as they become available and as it becomes possible to release the Canadian and other labourers now engaged on timber production.-VI. Electric Power.Sir Albert Stanley has made certain proposals with regard to electric power (G.T.-6248), and the question is raised in the Memorandum on Demobilisation by the Minister of Reconstruction (G.T.-6047). As this subject does not affect demobilisation, its immediate consideration by the Demobilisation Committee was not considered necessary.VII. Appointments for Officers.The Appointments Department, now working under the Ministry of Labour, has already in existence an organisation for the placing of ex-officers. The scheme of this department is mapped out to cover the whole of the United Kingdom, the Dominions, and other countries.The Officers&apos; University and Technical Training Committee has estimated that all places of higher education, other than agricultural education, in England and Wales, might absorb a total of some 15,000 students on demobilisation. They have considered the question of State assistance to these students, and are of opinion that it should not in general exceed a maximum of 2251. a student per annum, including fees and maintenance.It is not anticipated that the maximum amount will have to be paid in a great number of cases owing to deductions on account of private means, scholarships, &amp;c.Assuming, however, that 15,000 awards are made, and that the average award made is 2001. per annum for two years, this would involve the State in a sum of about 6,000,0001.   This figure is probably to be regarded as an outside one.It should be made clear that this estimate only affects higher education in England and Wales, and a further sum would be required for practical training in offices, works, and professional employments.It is suggested by the Officers&apos; University and Technical Training Committee, that the awards should be made by the Department on whose estimates the sums for assistance for the particular type of training in question are borne.We were informed that the President of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries has laid before the Treasury proposals for giving financial assistance to ex-officers and men of like standing who are prepared to undergo a period of agricultural training. Mr. Prothero estimates the cost of the scheme on a basis of 50 scholarships and 1,000 allowances at 310,000Z.We recommend that these proposals be adopted, and that the Officers&apos; University and Technical Training Committee be instructed to report at the earliest possible moment with regard to a scheme for practical training in offices, works, and professional employments.J. C. SMUTS, Chairman.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. .1, November 14, 1918.
-[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Maj esty s Government.]^ Printed for the War Cabinet.   December 1918.SECRET. G.T.-6277 (a.)WAR CABINET.DEMOBILISATION AND RECONSTRUCTION SCHEMES.Supplementary Report by the Demobilisation Committee to the War Cabinet.(Previous Paper, G.T.-6277.)IN continuation of our Interim Report (G.T.-6277), the Demobilisation Committee has consulted with Lord Inchcape, as representing the Treasury, in order to meet the financial points raised in regard to our proposals. In view of the anticipation that in the next twelve months there might not be very great unemploy-ment, the Committee agreed to reduce the Road Programme for the next twelve months to a lower level. The other recommendations of G.T.-6277 were agreed to by the Treasury as maxima to be prepared for and worked up to as the exigencies of unemployment demanded.The Committee requested the Road Board to prepare a less extensive scheme than the one previously submitted. The first programme estimated a total expenditure of 84,000,000Z. with a first years expenditure of 30,000,0001, the Government being asked to contribute 24,000,000Z. of this latter sum, the remainder being provided from the funds in the hands of the local authorities.The programme now submitted by the Road Board, which we ask the War Cabinet to sanction, is as follows. It can be carried out without prejudice to the more extensive scheme, should the Government at any time deem it desirable to embark upon a larger programme. It is also exclusive of the work of maintenance and restoration, which the local authorities will carry out at their own expense, and which will involve them in an expenditure of over 29,000,0001.:--Expenditure for the Financial Year 1919-20.&apos;.   - -The Road Board to arrange for a 10,000,0002. programme for reconstructing important roads, and rebuilding and strengthening bridges. This is of the nature of capital expenditure, as distinguished from ordinary repairs and renewals to be carried out by the local authorities. The 10,000,0001. (8,250,0001. of which is to be found by the Government and 1,750,0001 from the Road Improvement Fund) will enable the following programme to be carried out: 1. (a.) Reconstructing 2,200 miles in England and Wales-        average 4,00OZ.-per mile  ... ... ... ...   8,800,000Reconstructing 300 miles in Scotland average 2,0001. permile..................     600,000(In selecting the roads and allocating the funds the Road Board will have regard to the expenditure which the individual authorities are undertaking for maintenance and reconstruction. Authorities which do not arrange an adequate programme to be paid for out of rates will not share in the free grants for recon-struction.), Cb.) Grant towards reconstructing 200 bridges      ...        ...     250,0002. The above items absorb 9,650,0002.; the remaining 350,0002. to be used by the Road Board to stimulate the production of road stone, supervise its distribution, and arrange for its transport where necessary.3. The whole of the plant at present in France, which cost about two million sterling, to be transferred to the Road Board without any cash payment having .to be [1055]document
omade in the first year, such plant to be at the disposal of the Road Board for developing the quarries, transporting stone, and for loan to the local authorities to carry out the road programme.4. It is estimated that this programme will give employment on the roads and in the quarries to 142,000 men, compared with the 85,000 employed before the war and 47,700 employed at the present time.The Committee recommend : (a.) That the road programme as outlined above be approved and put in hand at once.(b.) That the Army Council-be asked to release the Director of Roads, with such pivotal men and materials as may be necessary to set going the above programme, and to transfer the road-making and quarrying plant as quickly as it can be released to the Road Board.(c.) That, should the War Cabinet approve of these recommendations, the Road Board should be instructed to furnish a monthly report on the progress of their road programme.The Committee further desire to draw the attention of the War Cabinet to the desirability of considering an improvement to the central organisation for road construction.(Signed)        J. C. SMUTS, Chairman.2, Whitehall Gardens, December 3, 1918.
