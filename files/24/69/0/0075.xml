(214COPY NO.     120149/5859.Tho Secretary,7/ar Cabinet.1*      As the War Cabinet are awaret the opening of tho Dardanelles will shortly throw open to the Allioa possible-ilitios if influonaing the situation in Russia to which those offered by bases cither in Worth Russia or Siberia arc inoemparablo cither in importance or magnitude.In regard to&apos; any attlon which nay bo contemplated, I wish to point out the great importance of insisting frc*irt the outset on the recognition cf the supremacy of Britifh interests in any undertaking in the North w South Caucasus : and Don country.     By the agreement arrived at in December, 1917, between the French and ourselves, these regions were recognised as the British sphere.      Rumania and. the Ukraine were allocated to the French.    Apart from the military, political and economical importance of those regions in connection with the whole British position in the East, the extension *f our operations to Baku and tho Caspian, and our victories over Turkey during the past year entitle us to a predominant position in this sphere.2.      The French have already received CGmmunicatione from an envoy who purports to represent General Denikin,     On our part, General iiilno has been instruotcd to secure direct communication with that off loop as early as possible&apos;, I regard it as of importance that a senior offioer with knowledge of the Russians, and who is personally known to denikin, should bo sent to General denikin at the earliest opportunity
opportunity to obtain authentic details of the situaticne This officer should bo accompanied by a email Staff con-voroant with the whole Russian situation, and mere particularly that cf tho South *     On tho return of this officer, and on receipt of his report; wo shall be in a position to judge cf the extent of support, if any, which it would bo necessary or advisable to extend to tho South Ea s t o r n mov c mo nt- s*3.        I propose that General Poolo should be sent, with Gonoral Wavoll and Lieut *-Gslonol Xoyos as his assistants 0 The situation in the North of Russia decs not demand Genera:&apos; roolo^s prosoned as Archangel and Murmansk during the f Intel1 will be entirely separated from one another a No largo questions of military policy which, require a local decision arc likely to arise *     General Maynard and General Ironside, to whom it is proposed to give the temporary rank of i-.iajor-General, arc not only Capable commanders, but possess the full confidence of our Allioo, to whom it ohoild not bo difficult, if necessary, to explain General Poclc:s absence,   (Draft instructions which it is proposed to issue to General -Poole are attached marked4,      Tho Agreement reached on december 23rd, 1917, (copy attached marked &quot;B&quot;) defines the regions of interest to us and to the French respectively.     Prom tho military point of view this allocation seems quite soundI ask tho War Cabinet to sanction the occupation of   v Bat cum, and possibly other Ports on the Eastern chores of the Black Sea, and the Railway Bat cum    Tiflis - Baku.By this movement we shall got a second L:&apos;.vnc of Ooiumunication to Baku, Enzoli and Krasnovedsk, and wo shall be in a position to extend a hand to denikin and all tho orderly elements in the Caucasus..But
But if these proposals are approved we must withdraw Milne from under D&apos;Esperey&apos;s command. We might leave a small force (say a Brigade) under D&apos;Esperey to go up to Roumania.

The questions of Archangel and of Siberia can be separately treated.

Draft Instructions for Major-General Poole.

1. In order to enables the War Cabinet to form an opinion as to the extent of support, if any, which it would be necessary or advisable to extend to General Denikin&apos;s and other similar movements in the North Caucasus and Don territories, you are to proceed as soon as possible after receipt Of these instructions, to the headquarters of the above named officers. 

2. You will acquadn? yourself with all details regarding the military, political and economic conditions in the above ? mentioned territories and return to London to render your report and personal opinion as soon as your investigations are completed.

3. You should establish cordial relations with General Denikin, but must be careful not to extend any promises  of assistance of any kind. Your report should, however, contain full details of the assistance which General  Denikin considers necessary with your remarks on these demands.

4. As regards your attitude to our Allies, and especially to any officers deputed by the French, you should remember that while our common purpose is the speedy restoration of responsible Government and settled conditions in Russia, the Don Territories and the Caucasus were recognised by the Anglo-French agreement of December, 1917, as belonging to the British sphere of special interest, while the French were responsible for the initiation of all measures in Roumania and the Ukraine.

It ? the intention of His Majesty&apos;s Government to uphold this decision, the reasons for which have been accentuated by the British advance to Baku and the Caspian and by our recent victories over the Turks.
