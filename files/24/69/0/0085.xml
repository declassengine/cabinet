NORTH SEA.Operations (other than Anti-Submarine) carried out during august, 19180Yarmouth, August 5-6th. Information having been received to the effect that hostile airships were approaching the coast of England, two aeroplanes were ordered out from Covchithe, three from Burgh Castle, and eight from Yarmouth.Only two machines met and engaged the enemy, these being D.H. 4 aeroplane A. 8030 (Pilot, Lieut. R. E. Keys ; Observer, Pte. Harman 210675) and D.H. 4 A. 8032 (Pilot, Major E. Cadbury; Observer, Capt. R. Lcckic).Five enemy airships are believed to have taken part in the attempted raid, and flew in two formations.When two of the enemy were attacked, the rest turned East and abandoned the raid.Both D.H. 4 aeroplanes claim to have shot down an enemy airship in flames.After careful investigation it has been decided that only one enemy airship was destroyed, and it is thought that the airship was in a position between the two attacking aeroplanes and that neither one saw the other.The pilots and observers of these two aeroplanes arc deserving of high praise in view of their prompt action and well-delivered attack.Felixstowe, August 11th.-Camel Aeroplane N. 6812 (Pilot, Lieut. Culley), whilst on lighter patrol, sighted an enemy airship. The aeroplane ascended at 0841, and at 1008 brought down the airship in flames.in position 53040&apos; N. 50 46&apos; E. The pilot had never seen a Zeppelin before, and it is therefore uncertain whether the aircraft was a Shuttle Lans or a Zeppelin it had one forward Gondola, two side ones, and one in the rear; it was painted black underneath and white on the top.   Only two enemy aircraft were seen.NO. 5 GROUP, DOVER PATROL. (Overseas Unit.)During the first part of August the weather was generally favourable for flying, but during the latter part it was unfavourable.RECONNAISSANCE.Photographic, W/T, and coastal reconnaissances were carried out, and movements of enemy shipping were reported. On August 13th, Varssenaere Aerodrome was photographed after the bombing attack of the early morning, and the result shows that the attack was successful.BOMBING RAIDS.Objects of Military importance have been attacked with success where conditions were suitable. A successful attack was delivered on Varsscnaere Aerodrome and two Gotha hangars, and at least six of the nine machines lined up on the aerodrome were destroyed, besides repair sheds and living quarters,, among which fires were observed:Units other than 5th Group have assisted in the bombing raids.The summary of bombs dropped during these operations is given in pages 4 and 5.ENEMY AIRCRAFT.Engagements with enemy aircraft have been above normal, and have resulted in 33 enemy machines being destroyed, 35 driven down; total, 68.On August 12th a lively engagement took place with 14 Fokker biplanes, No. 204 Squadron co-operating with No. 218 Squadron. Four enemy air-craft were destroyed, two by Capt. Hunter and one each by Lieuts-.- O. J. Orr
id R. M. Gordon.   Four other enemy machines were driven down out of jntrol, two by Lieut. Pomeroy and one each by Lieuts. R. M. Gordon and J-Orr.A large formation of Fokker biplanes and Phalz Scouts was encountered er Menin on August 15th, and a fierce fight took place, lasting a quarter of hour.  Enemy scouts were destroyed by Lieut. R. M. Bennett, Lieut. R. R. Hickey and Lieut. R. M. Gordon.  Two other enenty machines were estroyed by Lieut. T. W. Nash and one by Lieut. R. M. Gordon.  Machines ere driven down out of control by the following pilots: Lieuts.

Woodhead and Lieut. E. E. P. Smith) carried out a patrol from Dundee of 10 hours 15 mins. This is a record for this type of aircraft.DETAILS OF ATTACKS ON ENEMY SUBMARINES.Houton Bay, August 1st-Large America Seaplane No. 4895 (Pilot Macro), whilst on patrol at 0833, in position 83 B., sighted the periscope of a submarine one mile distant, steering N.E.The periscope disappeared about 30 seconds previous to the dropping of a bomb, which exploded just ahead of where the periscope was last seen. Communication was established with a light cruiser and two destroyers: one of the latter proceeded to the position of attack.A distinct dark patch was observed on the water after the attack, which had not disappeared when the seaplane left the position.Seaton Carew, July 28th.-Blackburn Kangaroo Aeroplane No. 9975 (Pilot, Lieut. Richardson) whilst on patrol sighted a submarine in position 540 45&apos; N. 0o 20&apos; W. Two bombs were dropped at 0750 on the position where the periscope disappeared, both of which failed to explode.Communication was established with a surface craft, which proceeded to the position and searched the area for some time, without result. The number of the submarine was not distinguishable, but a grey object, probably a gun, was observed behind the conning tower.Seaton Carew, July 28th. Blackburn Kangaroo Aeroplane No. 9972 (Pilot, Lieut. Dean ; Observer, Lieut. Knightsbridge) whilst on patrol sighted a trawler dropping depth charges in position 54c 39&apos; N. 0o 55&apos; W. A few minutes later the wake of a submarine was sighted half a mile East, and two bombs were dropped, which exploded about 10 yards to starboard of the head of the&apos; wake.The position was searched without result, and the aeroplane returned to base and reported.Seaton Carew, July 28th-Blackburn Kangaroo Aeroplane No. 9976 (Pilot, Lieut. Waring; Observer, Lieut. Brocklesby) whilst on patrol sighted the conning tower and periscope of a submarine approximately 12 miles S.E. of Seaham. At 1907 two 230-lb. bombs were dropped, one of which exploded 30 yards ahead of the conning tower, the other apparently hit the conning tower and the craft disappeared suddenly. The machine returned to base for more bombs and returned about half an hour later to the position, which was marked by three drifters. The aeroplane cruised about for some time, but observed nothing further.The submarine had two periscopes, one longer than the other; only the top of the conning tower was seen.Hornsea, August 9th.-Sopwith Baby Seaplane No. 2095 (Pilot, Lieut. Sherwood), whilst on patrol at 2010, sighted the periscope of a submarine in position 54019&apos; N. 0o 15&apos; W. The seaplane proceeded to the spot and dropped one 654b. bomb [2\ seconds delay) from 100 feet on the wake left by the
submarine, which had submerged at a distance of 2-3 miles, immediately after it had been sighted.   Owing to the roughness of the sea, nothing further was^&apos; seen of the submarine.   The bomb exploded 15 feet ahead of the estimated:; position of the hull of the submarine.Surface craft in the vicinity came to the spot, and searched the area! without observing anything further.Houton Bay, August 11th.-Large America Seaplane No. 4895 (Pilot,; Captain E. P. Davis; Observer, W. Sanderson), whilst on patrol, at 1100,; sighted a large submarine on the surface in position 580 35&apos; N. I0 07&apos; W., about; 3 miles distant.After a few minutes had passed the submarine submerged, leaving al swirl where it had disappeared.An excellent run was obtained over the submarine and two 230-lb. bombs j were dropped, one of which exploded a short distance in front of the swirl, and the other just over the swiri.Great difficulty was experienced in keeping the seaplane level owing to fog which prevailed at the time, and as nothing further was to.be seen of the submarine the machine returned to base.The submarine was 300 to 350 feet long, with two periscopes up, one larger than the other ; a raised forecastle, and a high and large conning tower. No guns or men were observed.   The colour of the submarine appeared to \ be a dark-greenish grey.Dunkirk, August 12th (217 Sqd., 61st Wing).-D.H. 4 Aeroplanes Nos. A. 8050 and A. 7772 whilst on patrol sighted a hostile submarine half blown 150 0&apos; from Middelkerke. Eight bombs were released, one of which, from 1000 feet, scored a direct hit on the port side, right alongside the conning tower. The submarine was seen by all pilots and observers to roll slowly over to starboard, lying bottom up for 5 minutes, and gradually to sink. The other 7 bombs, dropped from heights varying from 200 to 1,000 feet, exploded close alongside tbe hull. After dropping the bombs, the aeroplanes circled round the submarine and fired 500 rounds of A.P. ammunition into the hull until she sank bodily. The submarine was seen for so brief a time before she turned turtle that accurate detailed observation was impossible. It is considered to have been of the U.C. 1-15 class of light grey colour, with dazzled top side, all the paint being new and clean, with no sign of rust.Seaton Carew, August 12th.-Sopwith Baby Seaplane No. 2109 (Pilot, Lieut. Taylor), whilst on patrol at 1915, sighted a periscope steering North in position 540 30&apos; N. 0o 28&apos; W. Course was altered to attack, and one 65-lb. bomb was dropped, which fell short, and 35 feet to starboard of the objective. An armed yacht was informed, which remained in the vicinity, but took no action.   Nothing further was observed.Tynemouth, August 21st.-Aeroplane D.H. 6 No. 2079 (Pilot, Lieut. Gibson), whilst on escort patrol at 1950, sighted a periscope 3 miles S E. of Suncleiiand.One bomb was dropped, which exploded two feet abreast and about 10 feet ahead of where the periscope had submerged. Communication was established with two destroyers and a MX., which dropped depth charges on the position indicated.A large amount of oil was observed on the surface after the bombing, but nothing further was observed.sea houses, August 24th-Aeroplane D.H. 6 No. 5172 (Pilot, Fit. Sergeant Douglas), whilst on patrol at 1615, sighted a submarine in position 550 35&apos; N. I0 30&apos; W. One bomb was dropped with no apparent result. Two destroyers were directed to the position and dropped depth charges on the spot indicated. Nothing further observed.   (No further details have been received.)
Torquay, August 24th.-Short Seaplane N. 2962 (Pilot, Lieut. Growden; Observer, A G. Bishop), whilst on patrol at 1450, sighted a submarine on the surface steering W. in position 50o 23&apos; N. 20 42&apos; W., about 4 miles distant on the port beam. The seaplane altered course and headed for the submarine, which slowly changed course to South and commenced to submerge.Two 100-lb. bombs were dropped, which exploded within a second of each other, 20 to 30 feet ahead of the swirl left by the submarine on submerging.There was a great disturbance of water after the attack and large quantities of oil rose to the surface. No surface craft were in sight, and the seaplane returned to base, after searching the position for 20 minutes, owing to shortage of petrol.Pembroke, August 24th.-D.H. 6 Aeroplanes Nos. B. 2789 (Pilot, Lieut. Nicholson) and F. 3351 (Pilot, Lieut. Peebles) whilst on patrol sighted the periscope of a submarine in position 76 N. and 76 T. at 1230 and 1445 respec-tively. The periscope was lowered before an attacking position was gained, but a bomb was dropped by each machine on the spot where the periscope disappeared; the one dropped by B. 2789 failed to explode.A patch of oil was observed after the attack, but nothing further was observed.F. 3351 fired lights to attract the attention of patrol boats in order that they might mark the suspected area.Seaton Carew, August 27th.-Sopwith Baby Seaplane No. 2109 (Pilot-Lieut. Clutterbuck), whilst on patrol at 0710, sighted the outline of a sub, merged submarine immediately below him, in position 540 26&apos; N. 0o 20&apos; W. The seaplane descended to about 400 feet, and dropped one 65-lb. bomb, which exploded about 25 feet to the starboard bow of the submarine. Reel Very&apos;s lights were fired, which attracted the attention of two M.L.&apos;s and some drifters, which proceeded to the spot, and dropped depth charges on the suspected position.   Nothing further was observed.Seaton Carew, August 27th-Blackburn Kangaroo No. 9978 (Pilot, Lieut. Cooper; Observer, A/M Twigg), whilst on patrol at 1135, sighted the periscope of a submarine steering N.E. in position 540 27&apos; N. 0o 25&apos; W. One 230-lb. bomb was released at 1140, detonating forty feet to port of the peri-scope.   A great quantity of oil and bubbles was observed after the bombing.At 1150, when in position 540 23&apos; N. 0o 22&apos; W., a second periscope was sighted steering S. One 230-lb. bomb was released, which exploded on the periscope. A large quantity of oil and bubbles rose to the surface, and a body was observed floating in the water. A quantity of reddish fluid was also observed, as distinct from the colour of the oil.No shipping was observed in the vicinity in either instance.Seaton Carew, August 28th.-Blackburn Kangaroo Aeroplane No. B. 9983 (Pilot, Lieut. Waring; Observer, Lieut. Smith), whilst on patrol at 1525, sighted a long oil slick about 5 miles distant. On investigation, a submerged submarine was sighted, in position 540 31&apos; N. 0o 40&apos; W., which appeared to be lying on the bottom.One 520-lb. bomb was released, which detonated 30 feet from the star-board bow of the submarine. Quantities of thick black oil and long succession of large oil bubbles rose to the surface.Red Very&apos;s lights were fired, and a destroyer came to the spot, where bubbles were still rising, and dropped eight depth charges. The last depth charge exploded directly over the hull of the submarine.Note. This has been classified by the Admiralty as &quot; probably sunk.&quot;Houton Bay, August 29th. Large America Seaplane No. 4897 (Pilots, Capt. Kenwood and 2nd Lieut. Cox), whilst on patrol at 1340, sighted a sub-marine, in position 83 U., which submerged on the approach of the seaplane. Two bombs, one of which failed to explode, were dropped on the position where the submarine submerged,   A green patch and a considerable disturbanceC48 a 3
was observed in the water. Attempts were made to inform trawler in the vicinity, but without immediate success. Eventually communication was established with the trawlers by means of Vcry&apos;s lights and Aldis Lamp, and the position of the submarine reported. Surface craft remained in the vicinity.  Nothing further was observed.Pierowall Advance Base, August 29th-Large America Seaplane No. 4441 (Pilot, Capt. B. E. Brend; Observer, A. J. Reith) whilst on patrol sighted a submarine, 10 miles distant on the port bow, which submerged 1  minutes before the seaplane arrived over the position.One bomb was dropped on the spot where the periscope disappeared, and large quantities of oil rose to the surface. The submarine was thought to be of a large type, painted a dark colour. Further details -could not be ob served owing to the submarine submerging.Scilly, August 30th.-Large America Seaplane No. 4238 (Pilot, Lieut. M. 0. Fairhurst; Observer, Capt. C. R. N. Stewart), whilst on patrol at 0903, sighted the conning tower of a submarine about 7 miles distant in position 78 W.The submarine submerged, and, at 0910, two 230-lb. bombs were dropped ahead of the oil patch left by the submarine.   No results were observed.W/T signals were sent to all ships, and a flare was dropped to mark the position.Houton Bay, August 31st.-Short Seaplane No. 2652 (Pilot, Capt. Macro ; Observer, Lieut. Sanderson), whilst on patrol, at 1645, sighted the conning tower and portion of the deck of a submarine about 2 mites distant, on the starboard bow. The submarine submerged about 60 seconds before the position was reached by the seaplane. One 100-lb. and one 230-lb. bombs were dropped from 800 feet. The first exploded on the end of the track left by the submarine on submerging, and the second exploded 25 to 30 yards ahead of the track.   No results could be observed owing to the rough sea.Three trawlers were observed in the vicinity, with which communication was established by Aldis Lamp. The trawlers proceeded to the position indicated by the seaplane. The machine was forced to return to base owing to lack of petrol.Table &quot; A.&quot;-SEAPLANES AND AEROPLANES.Stations.

Howden, August 12th. Rigid Airship No. 27, whilst on patrol at 1206, sighted a submerged submarine 3 miles N.E. Flamboro&apos;, about 800 yards on the starboard, steering North (Mag.). There was no sign of the submarine on the surface, but R. 27 was in a position between the sun and the submarine, and every detail of the latter was plainly visible below the surface. The Airship altered course, and on passing over the submarine two 230-lb. bombs were dropped, one of which exploded on the estimated position of the sub-marine. On approaching the submarine, the sun came on the starboard quarter, and the effect on the water rendered the objective invisible.   MarkTable &quot; A.!-SEAPLANES AND AEROPLANES-continued.
Buoys were dropped, and nothing further was observed except a quantity of fresh oil rising on the wake of the submarine where the first bomb dropped. The Base and surface craft were informed by W/T and Very&apos;s lights, and the airship remained in the vicinity until driven off by thunder at 1310. It is thought that both bombs exploded very close to the submarine.Folkestone, August 12th.-Airship S.S. Z. 5, whilst on patrol at 1030, sighted oil and air bubbles rising 3 miles due S. of Seaford. One 65-lb. bomb was dropped, after this the oil disappeared.At 115, half a mile N.E. of the above-mentioned position, the periscope and conning tower of a submarine was sighted moving slowly in an Easterly direction. The submarine submerged immediately, and one 100-lb. bomb was dropped 110 yards ahead of the swirl, six seconds after the submarine submerged.   Surface craft were informed, but nothing more was observed.Table &quot; B.&quot;-AIRSHIPS.Stations.	Xo. of	Time.		No. of	No. of	Submarines.		Patrols.	Hours.	Mins	Miles.

Reports of operations against submarines have been received from 33 Airship and Seaplane stations on the E., S., and W. Coasts of Great Britain, and from Dunkirk.Submarines Sighted.-During the year ending April 12th, 1918, the total number of submarines sighted by aircraft patrols, as obtained from the returns sent in, is 194. Of these, 107 were sighted off the South Coast (including Dunkirk), 74 on the East Coast, and 13 on the West Coast.Sighting Distance. The average distances at which the submarines were sighted are : E. Coast, 4&quot;2 miles; S. Coast, 4&apos;4 miles; W. Coast, 5 miles i.e., generally between 4 and 5 miles. This distance must, ol course, depend on general visibility, condition of submarines, nature of glasses used. The body of the submarine can be made out from a distance of 10-15 miles ; periscopes have been distinguished at 5, 6, 8 and even 15 miles (Newlyn) ; a totally submerged submarine was picked up by ripples and oil at 8 miles (Fishguard). These are presumably estimated distances, and depend on observer&apos;s judgment.Condition when Sighted. The following facts are recorded as to sub-marine^ condition when sighted : (a) On surface or awash E. Coast, 81% ; S. Coast, 66% ; W. Coast, 38%.  In general, 70%.(b) Submerged, or with periscope visible E. Coast, 19% ; S. Coast, 34% ; W. Coast, 62%.   In general, 30%.In 88% of cases some portion of submarine is above surface when sighted.Condition when Reached. When reached, condition of submarines was as follows: (a) On surface or awash, or with periscope showing or visible under water  E. Coast,-28% ; S. Coast, 31% ; W. Coast, 23%.  Generally, 27%. &apos;   (b) Submerged E. Coast, 72% ; S. Coast, 69% ; W. Coast, 77%.  Generally, 73%. Time Taken to Reach. The time taken to reach the submarine is recorded in most cases, and the following figures appear: (a) Less than 1 minute E. Coast, 11% ; S. Coast, 8% ; W. Coast, nil.(b) 1 to 5 minutes East, 44% ; South, 62% ; West, 20%.(c) Over 5 minutes East, 44% ; South, 30% ; West, 80%.
Time Since Submarine Submerged.-The time-interval between sub-marine submerging and aircraft reaching it is rarely recorded except in the case of Felixstowe ; where recorded, it appears to be longer than noted by Fclixstowe (up to 8 minutes) ; in no recorded case less than A minute.Behaviour of Submarines when Approached.-The behaviour of the submarine on sighting patrol is here in question. The Scillies report two instances of submarines opening fire on H. 12 machines, one being damaged ; the Mullion airship was fired on in a mist; and a -Short machine operating from Bembridgc was fired at &quot; spasmodically &quot; by a submarine which it had prevented from submerging. A seaplane from Newhaven was forced to land through engine trouble, and was fired at while gliding down.Depth of Water frequented by Submarines.-The depth of water in which submarine was operating is given in most cases ; thus :  &apos; E. Coast, mean depth 123 ft. (range 40-240) S.    ,,       ,,     ,,   209 ft. (  ,,   86-450) W.   ,, 255 ft. (  ,, 114-448)It is of interest to note that the submarine was identified in some cases as a green patch under water at 20 feet.Dropping of Bomb. Bombs were dropped in 68% of cases of sub-marines sighted (E. Coast, 62% ; S. Coast, 70% ; W. Coast, 85%).ITEMS OF INTEREST.Extract from Malta Bi-Monthly Minesweeping Report, 15-9-18.On September 6th, at 4.0 p.m., aircraft reported mines were sighted in position 350 48f&apos; N. 140 28A/ E. Two Drifters and one Motor Launch were patrolling in that vicinity, and Dan Buoys were dropped. The signals were also observed by the Minesweeping craft, and within 20 minutes two pairs of sweepers were in the area. Sweeping was carried on until dark, but no mines were found.On the following morning 3 Paddlers and 2 Motor Launches commenced to search, and later a trawler joined with one of the paddlers. Searching continued all day, but no mines were found, and it is suggested that turtles were observed, which shows that a good look out was kept by the aircraft, as turtles a few feet below the surface have the appearance of a mine.Extract from a Report from the Minesweeping Officer on Staff of British Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean.The Laying of Dummy Minefields. It is important that these mines be painted the colour to be expected on enemy mines.Report from Malta Experimental Station of October, 1917, says : &quot; The most suitable colour for diminishing the visibility of a submerged object is RED, or any pigment known to be free from BLUE-GREEN.&quot; The most suitable colour for giving prominence to a submerged object is a pure BLUE-GREEN. White paint would also be a very suitable colour, as it is rich in BLUE-GREEN.&quot;Note. Mines down any time will not retain their colour. Two spherical mines painted RED were laid down at Malta one 8 feet and one 19 feet below the surface in 25 fathoms of water. I have flown over them in both Seaplane and Kite Balloon at 500 feet altitude. The shallow-laid mine was easily picked up on each occasion, appearing a grey colour. The other was not located, though we knew where it was. From Kite Balloon, mine was first located at least 400 yards out of the track of the towing vessel. Weather conditions on each occasion were favourable. One BLUE-GREEN and one GREEN mottled CHOCOLATE, spherical mines have now been laid, and further trials will be made and report forwarded.
Mines laid in Dummy Minefields should be made as buoyant as possible; before laying, that they may support extra moorings to prevent possibility of breaking away; and should be painted with some distinctive mark to ensure them being easily recognised to avoid false alarms if they did break adrift.The question of Pilots using the most suitable coloured glasses for observing under-water objects is raised.FRENCH NAVAL AIR SERVICE.During the month of July, the French Naval Air Service have (excluding Kite Balloons) carried out 4,248 anti-submarine patrols, covering a distance of 485,350 miles. Of this distance, 432,890 miles have been flown by sea-planes and aeroplanes, and 52,440 miles by airships.Submarines have been attacked on 14 occasions.Mines have been sighted on 12 occasions.The following are details of attacks :-Camaret, July 3rd. A submarine was sighted by a flight of seaplanes 10 miles W. of LTle Vierge. The submarine dived immediately, and, owing to the strength of the wind, the seaplanes were unable to reach the position before the submarine had submerged. One bomb was dropped on the swirl left on the surface. The Base was informed by W/T, and search patrols were sent out.Cherbourg, July 5th. A patrol of seaplanes, whilst on patrol, sighted a muddy streak 20 miles E. of Barfleur, and on investigation a dark shadow, having the appearance of a submarine, was seen. Two bombs were dropped, one of which failed to explode. The area was searched for some time, but nothing further was observed.Marsala, July 6th. An Aircraft patrol set out, at 0943, in search of a previously-reported submarine. At 1115 a submarine was sighted on the surface steering N.N.W. The submarine dived just as the two machines reached the position. Three bombs were dropped, which exploded in the disturbance caused by the submerging of the submarine. Surface craft and Base were informed by message buoys and W/T respectively, and the area was searched for some time without success. The submarine was seen later in the day by patrol boats, and it is assumed that she was not damaged by the aircraft attack.Guernsey, July 8th. Two seaplanes, whilst on patrol, sighted, at 1250, a disturbance of water, and on investigation sighted a wake with a periscope showing intermittently. Four bombs were dropped on the spot where the periscope was seen. Nothing more was seen of the submarine either by these machines or other patrols sent out during the night.Bizerte, July 8th. Two seaplanes set out on patrol and sighted a sub-marine on the surface steering N.N.E. Three bombs were dropped one failed to explode, one exploded abeam and very near the conning tower, which had just submerged, and the other on the wash left by the submarine on submerging.Base was informed by W/T., and at 0745 one of the seaplanes was forced to land owing to engine trouble, and a pigeon was released informing the Base of the position of the two seaplanes, one of which was endeavouring to aid the other. One seaplane returned to Base, and the other was wrecked, the crew being saved.Guernsey, July 16th. Whilst on patrol, a patrol of seaplanes sighted a half-blown submarine S.W. of the Hanois Islands.The submarine had a rounded bow, with a conning tower leaning aft. Two bombs were dropped on the wash left by the submarine, which had
submerged on the approach of the seaplanes. The position was marked by a calcium flare, and the seaplanes returned to Base and reported, after which another patrol was sent out.This second patrol sighted a long dark shadow just below the surface, which was rendered very apparent by the calm sea. The submarine dived, leaving air bubbles and a large upheaval on the surface. Two bombs were dropped, both of which failed to explode, and the area was searched for some time without result, and the patrol was forced to return to base owing to failing light.Bayonne, July 23rd. Whilst on escort patrol, a section of seaplanes sighted a dark form, thought to be a submarine, below the surface, 5 miles W. of the convoy. Two bombs were dropped on the position, and the convoy was warned of the presence of the enemy. No results were observed, and other patrols failed to find any further trace of the submarine.Dunkirk, July 24th. A patrol of 2 triplanes and 3 seaplanes set out at 0535 to search for a reported submarine.The submarine was sighted to the N.W. starting to submerge, and on the arrival of the aircraft had completely disappeared, leaving only a slight disturbance upon which two bombs were dropped, only one of which exploded. Nothing further was observed.Sousse, July 27th. Three seaplanes, whilst on patrol, sighted a submarine after she had taken the captain of a sailing vessel prisoner. The crew of the vessel re-embarked under the protection of the aircraft, but the boat, having sustained damage by shell fire, sank before reaching port. Nothing more was seen of the submarine, which rapidly submerged on sighting the aircraft.Camaret, July 28th. After having escorted a convoy, a patrol of seaplanes sighted, at 1130, a half-submerged submarine 15 miles N. of Stiff. The sub-marine dived, but one of the seaplanes arrived over the spot just in time to drop two bombs ahead of the wash. Oil bubbles rose to the surface. Sur-face craft was informed by means of a message buoy, and an &quot; allo&quot; to Base by W/T. The latter was not received, but a patrol boat had informed the Base, and a section of seaplanes was sent out. One of the machines of this second section experienced engine trouble and the other continued the search for the submarine, and sighted the enemy 20 miles N. of Stiff, some miles ahead of the convoy. The submarine submerged rapidly, leaving an upheaval in the water upon which two bombs were dropped. Nothing more was seen, and the seaplane returned to base owing to the irregular running of the engine.Guernsey, July 30th. Two seaplanes, whilst on patrol at 0845, 20 miles N.W. of Guernsey, sighted what appeared to be the periscope of a submarine, followed by a wash and an upheaval thought to be caused by the conning tower. Four bombs were dropped, which exploded on the position of the submarine.Base was informed by W/T and the area well searched, but all that was to be seen was oil and air bubbles rising to the surface.Marquise, July 7th.-Airship V.Z. 1, whilst on patrol at 0710, sighted oil bubbles rising and breaking on the surface in position S.W. of Ver-goyer. Three phosphorous buoys were dropped to mark- the position. The bubbles were observed to be rising in the same position, giving the impression that a submarine was lying on the bottom.At 0800 one bomb was dropped from. 270 metres, which exploded on the spot where the oil bubbles rose.An &quot; allo &quot; was sent to Base, whereupon seaplanes from Boulogne set out, and on arrival to the position found a muddy patch with oil bubbles rising.The airship was obliged to return to&apos; Base owing to engine trouble.
