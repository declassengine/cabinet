SUMMARY OF BLOCKADE INFORMATION?

Nov. 1 - Nov. 7, 191?.

?1. ? The Spanish Government have seized 6 Germans ships interned in Spain, and the vessels now fly the Spanish flag. Except in the case of one vessel, however, the transfer appears to be provisional and the Germans are still entitled to claim their return at the end of the war?. We have informed the Spanish Goverment that we cannot recognise a provisional transfer of this kind, and the Admiralty have issued instructions that the vessels in question shall be seized if encountered outside Spanish territorial waters.

On October 30th? the Dutch Government announced that the German Government had ? to the Dutch flag six ? in the Dutch East? Indies. The Dutch Government understand that H.M.? Government will not allow ? ships to be used until the terms of transfer have been formally approved. We require the transfer to be absolute, the German ? on board to be discharged in the Dutch ?East Indies and the Dutch authorities to time?-charter the vessels or vessels of corresponding size in Holland to the Allies for the period of the war for services outside the danger zone.

On November 4th the Chilian Government took possession of all the German vessels sheltering in Chilian ports.  There are 84 vessels, including four which had previously been taken over.

The Argentine Government have informed Sir R. Tower that the ex-German steamship "Bahia Blanca" will shortly sail for Europe under the Argentine flag. H.M.? Government have not yet approved of the terms of transfer of this vessel, which is apparently to be chartered to the Swiss Government for Swiss services. Sir R.? Tower has been instructed to inform the Argentine Government that H.M.? Government cannot recognise this transaction until they have examined the conditions attached to the cession of this vessel by her German owner.
On October Jsyth tho Cormana were offering merchant tonnage to Sweden at 500 orowns per ton, with export lieonsen guar&amp;n-teedtBLOC K/Jf      The JStnistry of Reconstruction have set up a Committeeto disouee the advisability of relaxing the embargo on the ox-pert of goods from tho United Kingdom in the closing stages of the war.   Meanwhile the British Licensing Author!ties have in-at mo ted the various Committees which deal with tho export of specific commodities from the United Kingdom to consider in what eases theae might bo either a relaxation of the existing p arohi bit ions or their complete removal *80B7/AY.   Under the recent Agreement between Norway a an the United States the Norwegian Authorities may not sanction exports from jjorway to other border neutrals without first concluding an. Agreement with tho neutral country of destination.   ?he United States Government have decided not to insist upon the immediate conclusion of Agreements with Sweden, Denmark or Switzerland. Norwegian goods may go forward to Denmark and Sweden provided they are consigned to the appropriate importing Associations and are. subject to the same conditions as goods imported into Denmark and Sweden from Allied countries.   Exports to Switaer-land may go forward provided they are consigned to the 8*5*3. and do not include goods which may be exported to the Central Empires under tho 0.3*3* Regulations.   An Agreement will, hew-ever, be necessary in the case of Holland, m tinder present oon-ditioas goods Imported from Norway may serve to release Dutch &apos; - native commodities for export to the enemy.STOLEN..      She  is ociated Governments are in orming the Swedish Govern-
1 0 C-1 - bmeat that, unless thoy reply without further ctalay to tho pro-tost or the associated 007oramenta against the recent exports from Sweden to Germany In broach of the Agreement between Sweden and tho United iitutea and furnish full particulars of these ox-ports, facilities for shipments to Sweden from overseas will aborti ly bo suspended.&quot;here are two further difficulties now outstanding in regard to which we have threatened the Handelakommlnsion with a suspension of facilities;-(a) The import statistics furnished by tho Swedish Authorities for the period April 1st to Jims 30th are highly unsatisfactory. They do not agroo with the figures compiled by the lar Trade Statiaj tical Department;   and, as only the aggregate Imports are shown, and as there la no indication Of the countries of origin, it i&amp; impossible to chock them.   Under the new Swedish Agreement we are entitled to receive monthly statistics of all imported rationed goods, cargo by cargo.    V/e are asking the Handelskommission to furnish the particulars to which we are entitled.(b) She Handelskommieaion propose to require Swedish importers of rationed goods to sell thorn only to firms designated by the Commission,   ?hey claim on insufficient grounds that this control 1 la necessary to secure an equitable distribution of Swedish importa We demand that, if say such supervision is necessary, the goodsin oueetion should, be distributed only to persons approved by the Inter-Alliod frads committee at Stockholm,ffa2HTi LAin)$*   It is reported that tho Dutch Authorities have prohibit-ed all exports to the Central limpiras and that the Dutch barges which htivo hitherto served tho Khlne towns in Germany are no long- -or leaving Holland *III? &apos;&apos;H-SOAi&apos;l&quot;)I if:\YliUl ^KAl?]&apos;l*   Aii Intor-Scawl innvlan Conference at Ohristlania hue settled the main outlines of Inter-Soandinavian
trade for 1919. The discussions of the Conference were secret and only ?mation of a general ? is available. Norway will supply her neighbours with herrings, nitrate of lime, raw materials for explosives, tanning materials and medicaments. Denmark will contribute cereals, butter, cheese and meat. Sweden will contribute iron and steel? goods, wooden goods and medicaments. Norway attaches considerable importance to the prospect of obtaining iron and steel goods, including shipbuilding materials from Sweden. The ? is closely interested in the Inter-Scandinavian exchanges. A representative of the Company has already asked whether they may send nitrate of sodium to Sweden. He points out that the Allies are now taking only ?4,000 tons of nitrate yearly, and that an appreciable surplus will be available for Sweden and Denmark.

?. BRAZIL. The Brazilian Government misconstru? the Allied memorandum presented on the 25th October as an attempt to bribe Brazil to take action which she would not be disposed to take upon her own initiative. They recapitulate the various measures already taken in Brazil in restraint of enemy trade and state that on June 7th they decided to allow German Banks in Brasil a term of six months in which to liquidate during which period their business would be carried on under licence. The Associated Governments point out that the reply of the Brazilian Government is based upon an entire misconception of the recent Allied communication. The Brazilian Government were merely? asked to liquidate enemy banks and interests in order that the Allied Governments might withdraw the Allied Blacklists for Brazil and offer Brazil financial assistance? without thereby running the risk of indirectly benefiting German concerns. The Allied Governments have no knowledge of the decision taken by the Brazilian Government to liquidate the German Banks in Brazil within six months. We are accordingly pressing for further particulars as to the terms upon which much liquidation will be carried out.
?. BULGARIA. The Army Council have decided that Bulgari? must for the present be regarded as enemy territory for the purpose of the Trading with the Enemy Acts?, and that it would be premature as yet to issue ? certificate? of friendly occupation. It is still possible that goods may reach Turkey or the Central Empires by way of Bulgaria. The United States State Department concur in the view of H.M.? Government that the question of relief? supplies for Bulgaria should not be considered until the needs of the territories of Serbia and Macedonia ? by Bulgaria have been met.

? OTTOMAN EMPIRE?. The military position does not yet permit of the resumption of trade with Palestine and Syria? as there are yet no regular transport facilities either by ? or sea. Shipments which go forward to ? will, however, be allowed facilities as soon as possible. In all cases the names of the ultimate consigne? must be submitted to the Military Authorities.
