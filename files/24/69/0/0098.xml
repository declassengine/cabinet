^H^^^jyPfiP^ ** -^e ^QP^y-of Sis Britannic Majesty^ Government]SECRET.Political Intelligence Department, Foreign Office.Special 6.MEMORANDUMonBRITISH COMMITMENTS TO THE SHEIKH OF MAVIA.SHEIKH BIN NASIR MUKBIL of Mavia is the most important local ruler on the Turkish side of the Aden-Yemen border, as laid down in the Anglo-Turkish Convention of the 9th March, 1914. &quot; His jurisdiction extends from Kataba (on the plateau) down to Sheikh Said, and he can control Ahmed Noman in that neutral zone.&quot;*The neutral zone referred to is of course the Yellow Area of the 1914 Convention, which is of vital strategical importance in connection with the control of the Red Sea, and which Turkey pledged herself not to alienate.Mavia was thus recognised by us as falling within the sphere of Turkish sovereignty, and he held his chieftainship, with a stipend, as a Turkish kaimakam (21661/15).His Majesty&apos;s Governments negotiations with Mavia were started at a later stage than those with the Idrisi, at a date when Turkey had already intervened in the war, and when the Imam&apos;s intention of adopting a neutrality unfriendly to Great Britain had become more or less apparent. Mavia took the initiative by writing a. letter to His Maj.jsty&apos;s Resident at Aden, which was reported bv the latter in a telegram of the 17th December, 1914 (84480/14) :-&quot; Powerful Sheikh Ibn Nasir Mukbil, hereinafter to be styled Mavia, writes praising our goodwill to Arabs and desire of pact between himself and Abdali Sultan, provided that we guarantee his independence thereafter. I have just received deputation of Mavia&apos;s agent and the influential Haj Ali Nasir al Kamarani .... Mavia and Abdali Sultan wish to make an offensive and defensive alliance, which would gain support of all our protected chiefs. If backed by us, and his independence under us guaranteed, Mavia will break away from Turks at once.&quot;This was commented upon as follows by the Government of India in a telegram of the 20th December, 1914, to the India Office (87030/14) :-&quot; The proposed alliance between Mavia and Abdali, although it is not usual in the case of protected chiefs, should, we consider, be countenanced in the special circumstances, and the independence of Mavia, under the protection of Great Britain, at the close of the war should be guaranteed by Government. It should be made clear, however, that at present we have no intention of giving these chiefs support in offensive operations, but will merely help them to protect and pacify their territories by granting them arms, ammunition, and money, and that, unless Sheikh Said is used for the purpose of making an attack on Perim, we shall take no further action against it.&quot;On the 28th December, 1914, the India Office telegraphed in regard to this to the Government of India (1395/15) : &quot; Your proposals are approved.....   I understand from Residents telegramthat Mavia may be expected to get the Turks out of iSheikh Said.&quot;On the 2nd February, 1915, however, the Turks invaded the Aden Protectorate, and the effect of this development upon our negotiations with Mavia was discussed by the Resident in a telegram dated the 8th February, 1915 (15601/15): &quot; Turks and Imam&apos;s troops crossed the frontier and were encamped within 7 miles Dala &apos;2.nd February. Amir Nasir is with Turks. He has been deposed by his people, who are prepared to resist invasion, but urgently press for assistance of arms and ammunition and presence of our troops. I can supply arms and ammunition.* Telegram of the 17th December 1914, from the Resident at Aden, in 84480/14. [938] B
&quot; I have interviewed Mavia&apos;s confidential agent to-day. He is ready to conclude an agreement with our tribesmen to attack Turks, and asks for 75,000 rupees. This sum might well be spent in view of Government grant to Idrisi of 55,000 rupees for the same purpose. If grant sanctioned, propose payment at my discretion as scheme develops. He states if no assistance given him he cannot take action against Turks. He might, in my opinion, on the other hand, be com-pelled by Turks to fight against us, in which case we must move out of Aden to his assistance and that of our own friendly tribes on our borders. Since Turks are now over our border, 1 would strongly recommend as a better alternative to paying the money to Mavia that a British force of one brigade of infantry and one mountain battery should be sent to Dala T have no doubt such an advance on our part will call in all our tribes as well as Mavia, who would fight with us in defence of their interests. Situation is entirely changed since the Turks crossed the frontier, and it is now imperative for British prestige among our protected tribes that the British should take action and lead them against the Turks, and not leave it to Mavia, a Turkish Arab, to do.&quot;On the 9th February, 1915, the Resident telegraphed further as follows (16539/15):-&quot; If Government will render assistance as asked for in above-mentioned telegram, Mavia can certainly squash this movement, but I still consider it better for our troops to go up, as this step would be more likely effectually to check movement.&quot;This telegram was repeated by the Viceroy to the India Office on the 10th February, 1915, with the following comment (16539/15) : &quot; We have informed Political Resident that no reinforcements, either permanent or temporary, can be sent from India, except in the case of extreme disorder. A sum of 75,000 rupees has been placed at his disposal to enable him to subsidise chiefs inside and on borders of protectorate, including Mavia. We have suggested that Mavia should not receive more than Idrisi.&quot;Further developments were reported by the Viceroy in a telegram of the 22nd February, 1915 (21661/15) :-&quot; Political Resident at Aden explains position of Mavia more difficult than that of idrisi, as former is a Turkish pasha in receipt of Turkish stipend and on actual Turkish soil, while latter is free from Turkish attack. Mavia undertakes to drive out Turks and Turkish Arabs from Liwa of Taiz, including Kazas of Kataba, Kaiuaira al Hagariya, Mokha, that is, from Kataba down to Sheikh Said. He will further expel Turkish forces now within our borders at Dala and Jubbal Jihaf. Resident is concluding terms with Mavia on lines approved b)r your telegram of the 28th December, but in view of Imam&apos;s attitude and likelihood of his joining Turks, as also possibility of fight being prolonged and aims of Mavia not being fulfilled, advocates his being authorised to promise extra pecuniary assistance to Mavia if move rendered imperative to secure co-operation in expulsion of Turks. As governor-general, Yemen, is reported to be proceeding to Ibb and Turks are in possession of Dala and plateau and have ascended Jubbal Jihaf, Resident considers Mavia should strike at once. We have therefore placed further 50,000 rupees at Resident^ disposal and have authorised his giving Mavia assurance within this limit, but have directed th-at before making any further promise he should satisfy himself that Mavia is seriously carrying out his engagements.&quot;The agreement referred to in this telegram was actually signed at Aden on the 19th February, 1915, Sheikh Haj Ali Nasir al Kamarani acting on Mavia&apos;s behalf as his plenipotentiary. The text was enclosed in a despatch from the Resident, dated the 23rd February. 1915 (50398/15). A copy is appended to the present memorandum, buta summary of the provisions may be given at this point.Article 1. The Resident to pay Mavia 75,000 rupees in instalments, the first instalment of 25,000 rupees to be paid over at once, through the Sultan of Lahej, the remainder at the discretion of the Resident and the Sultan in proportion to the work done by Mavia.Article 2. His Majesty&apos;s Government will pay further subsidies, in excess of the 75,000 rupees, at their discretion, if the above sum appears insufficient for the expulsion of the Turks and their Arab allies from the Liwa of Taiz.
Article 3. His Majesty&apos;s Government will not treat separately with any other Arab Chief in the Liwa of Taiz, but will assure them, if necessary, that they &quot; must be submissive to &quot; Mavia.Article 4. When the fighting is over and Sheikh Muhammad Nasir (of Mavia) has gained the upper hand in the Liwa of Taiz, the British Government shall then recognise the chieftainship of Sheikh Muhammad Nasir and his independence. They undertake to place him under their protection and to protect him from the aggression of any European Power or from the Turks.Article 5.-Mavia undertakes to break with the Turks from this date, to open hostilities against them upon receipt of the first instalment of the British subsidy, and not to desist until he has expelled both them and their Arab allies from the Liwa of Taiz (limits specified).Article 6. Mavia undertakes to remove Sheikh Kayid Saleh from the limits of the Aden Protectorate (which he had invaded at, the instigation of the Turks), and to secure his co-operation for the objects of Article 5.Article 7. In case the Turks in Liwa of Taiz surrender to Mavia on condition of being deported to some other Turkish territory, the Eesioent agrees to take charge of them and carry out such stipulation after the termination of the war.On the 13th March, 1915, the Government of India instructed the Resident at Aden regarding this agreement as follows (50398/15): &quot;The agreement concluded by you with the representative of Mavia, is approved generally by the Government of India. It should, however, be made clear to Mavia that the guarantee given him U&apos;ider clause 4 is dependent on the obligations under clauses 5 and 6 being wholeheartedly carried out by him, and that it should also be clearly understood that the agreement can only be ratified &quot;on this condition.&quot;In a telegram of the same date (50398/15^ the Viceroy informed the India Office in a general way both of the terms of the agreement and of the Government of india instructions to the Resident.Relation of Commitments to the Sheikh of Mavia to British Desiderata.The Agreement of the 19th February, 1915, with Mavia is presumably annulled by the fact that Mavia shortly afterwards joined forces with the Turks. His Majesty&apos;s Government may therefore consider themselves free of all commitments under this agreement for the present, but it does not follow that the agreement should not be taken into account in the peace settlement. *In the first place.there is some evidence that Mavia&apos;s return to Turkish allegiance was merely due to necessity. So long as the Turks occupied the Aden hinterland and invested us within the walls of Aden town he could hardly take any other course, and it may well be true that he has never ceased to prefer relations with us.*And, in the second place, he might, if loyal, provide a valuable counterpoise in the Yemen to the Imam of Sanaa, whose pretensions are very great. It would hardly be in His Majesty&apos;s Government^ interest to allow the Imam to establish authority over the plateau of Kataba and the Yellow Area on the coast, which are both positions of the greatest strategical importance. A minor chief like Mavia would be preferable as a neighbour here. If we decided to retain him, the question would arise whether we should recognise his independence, on the lines of article 4 of the 1915 Agreement (replacing the agreement by a Trucial Treaty in stricter form), or whether we should treat his failure to observe the agreement as a ground for giving him less favourable conditions.The alternative would be to make him a &quot;protected &quot; chief instead of an indepen-deut &quot; trucial&quot; chief, and to include his territory within the boundaries of the Aden Protectorate, instead of leaving it as one of the States of Independent Arabia.We have a free hand to do this under article 10 of the Anglo-French Agreement of the 16th May, 1916, and it is unlikely that any opposition would be ottered by the Idrisi or King Husein, to both of whom we are pledged not to extend our possessions in Arabia beyond the status quo. The question is almost certain to arise in the course of future negotiations with the Imam, and he alone is likely to offer violent opposition.* On the 19th August;, 1915, the Resident at Aden telegraphed (116337/15):-&quot; Mnvia Sheikh&apos; although with Turks at Eahej, has not actively participated against us.   He -would probably join us if we advanced, and would attempt to carry out his agreement with us.  He is very anxious to become a, stipendiary of the British Government.&quot; .[938] B 2
The conduct of Mavia since the Turkish occupation of the Aden hinteriaiui is recorded in a memorandum by Colonel Jacob dated the I Oth May, 1916 (India Office, Secret, B231, 1916):-&quot;The Mavia Sheikh concluded an agreement on the 19th February, 1915. hie tried to do his part, but we did not coriespond. Had we done so, the move to Lahej would have been forestalled. Mavia, has never taken an active ]&apos;art against us. His arrival on the Dala plateau was the result of the Amirs coqir putting with the Kaimakam of Kataba. Mavia deposed the Amir and put up a relative. He then changed his quarters and went to Mavia. A brother of the present Abdali Sultan was deputed to meet him at Musemir. The house of Abdnli, however, did not approve of the &apos; Mavia agreement.&apos; The Abdali did not want to see a strong ruler in that quarter under our flag, which was the programme we had proposed, and to which Mavia had assented. The Abdali mission failed on account of the maladroitness of its representative. Mavia would not lead the attack on Lahej, pleaded sickness, and was eventually put on the Turkish black list as pro-British. He was not present at the occupation of Lahej, and has ever since then been moving about in the neighbourhood of Mavia, while once, to deceive the Turks, he led another movement on the the Dala plateau, this time against the Shairis.&quot;In an earlier memorandum, dated the 9th September, 1915 (l 55634/15), Colonel Jacob summed up the situation with regard to Mavia as follows v &quot; Ibn Nasir Mukbil known as Mavia has foiled us. He expected to be kept in his tract of Kumaira and Shurman under our aegis. He dislikes both-Turks and Imam. His adhesion to the Turkish cause the result, I believe, of force majeure, and also some diffidence in his mind of our bona fides, since-we did not move up to meet him at Dalai though not necessarily indicative of any hostile animus against us, will put him into a difficult position with ourselves when peace is concluded. His country is very fertile and rich, as is also that of Hujariya, to the south, which also Ibn Nasir Mukbihs influence pervades, and even so far south as Sheikh Said. This country the Imam will covet. It should properly be ours, in spite of our declared policy to hold aloof.&quot;This quotation appears to cover the main points that will have to be taken into account when the time for settlement comes.APPENDIX.Text of Agreement of February 19, 1915.This agreement is made between Major-General D. G. L. Shaw, Political Resident, Aden, on behalf of the Great British Government, and Sheikh Haj Ali Nasir al Kamarani, on behalf of Sheikh Muhammad Nasir Mukbil, Kaimakam of Shurman and al Kama-ira.1. The Political Resident, Aden, undertakes to pay to Sheikh Muhammad Nasir Mukbil the sum of 75,000 rupees by instalments. The first instalment of 2.r),000 rupees shall be paid at once through Sultan Sir Ali-bin-Ahmed-bin-Ali, K.C.I.E., of Lahej. The remaining instalments will be paid according to the discretion of the Political Resident as advised by the said Sultan, and they both will fix the amounts to be paid on each subsequent occasion. The sums which will be paid shall be deter-mined both by the extent of the work already done by Sheikh Muhammad Nasir Mukbil and by that also which remains to be done .by him in the future.2. Should the sum of 75,000 rupees prove insufficient for the end in view, viz., the expulsion of Turks or their Arab allies both of the Shafai and also the Zaidi creeds who are actually co-operating with the Turks, from the Liwa of Taiz, the British Government undertakes in the same way to give still more monetary assistance in such quantity as may to Government seem sufficient and essential.3. Should any of the chiefs and sheikhs in the Liwa of Taiz call on the Political Resident during the duration of the fighting, and demand to be detached from the control of Sheikh Muhammad Nasir, the Government (British)&apos; ahould assure such chief that he must be submissive to Sheikh Muhammad Nasir, and should decline to accept his overtures.4. When the fighting is over, and Sheikh Muhammad Nasir has gained the upper hand in the Liwa of Taiz, the British Government shall then recognise the chieftainship of Sheikh Muhammad Nasir and his independence. They (Government) undertake to place him under their protection, and to protect him from the aggression of any European Power or from the Turks.&apos;5. In consideration of the above, Sheikh Muhammad Nasir Mukbil swears by the Great God and undertakes to be true and faithful to this agreement in favour of the British Government, and that he shall relinquish the friendship existing between the Turks and himself from the date of this
agreement. That after receiving the first instalment of the amount mentioned iu article 1, he shall collect his forces and supporters, and shall stir up a quarrel and fight with full determination and firm resolution against all the Turks and their Aral) allies (both Shafai and Zaidi) in the Liwa of Taiz. And by th 3se aids, be binds himself to leave the Turks neither comfort nor repose, but to fight them throughout the Liwa both by night and by day till he expels them entirely from the Liwa, its districts, and environments as below specified: From the districts of al Kama ira, al Udein, al Hajaria, Tbb, Mokha, and Kataba and the appanages thereof, viz., Makbana, Shar Ab, Sabir, and DM Sharak. And further expel the Arabs therefrom or bring them under subjection to himself.6. Sheikh Muhammad Nasir Mukbil undertakes to remove Sheikh Kayid Salehand his adherents from the limits included in the protectorate of the Great British Government, and to bring his hostile movement at Dala, Jihaf, &amp;c, to a close, and further to attach him (Kayid Saleh) as a co-helper in the enterprise alluded to above.7. In the event of the Turks surrendering to Sheikh Muhammad Nasir Mukbil in the Liwa of Taiz on condition of their being deported to some country under Turkish sway, the Political Eesident undertakes to take charge of such and to keep them in safety and secure from all harm, and after the termination of the war in Europe he will send them back to their country.This agreement is made and drawn on Friday, the 5th Rabi Al Akhar 1383, corresponding with the 19th February, 1915 a.d.D.
