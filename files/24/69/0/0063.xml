la.Memorandum by the President of the Board of ffradej q pI should like.to suggest, for the consideration of the War Cabinet, that in view of the Armistice and the general alteration of the situation, it v/ould not be unwise to permit some relaxation of the restrictions whioh have been placed upon popular amusements and in particular    on horse racing.It was decided in &quot;Jay last that no flat racing should be allowed except et Newmarket after the 31st May and that no racemeeting under the rules of the National Hunt Committee should be allowed during the present winter season.   This decision was con-firmed at a meeting of the War Cabinet on the 21st June.   I have ascertained from the Hallway Executive Committee that they would have no objection to a limited amount of racing- under National Hunt Rules during the winter season and they would equally have no ob-jeotion to some extension of flat racing next season to places other then Newmarket, and I would suggest that I should communicate with the National Hunt Committee and the Jockey Club to the effect that the Government woule not object to a limited programme at pieces to be approved by the Board of Trade after consultation with the Army Council.A further decision of the War Cabinet on the 21st June wasthat unauthorised /flapping races should be prohibited and a Defence of the Realm Regulation (9 3.) was made to give effect to this decision.,   These meetings really cause no pressure on the railways,but it was felt that they could not be -permitted when meetings under recognised rules were being drastically restricted or pro-hibited.   If some racing during the winter and an  extended pro-gramme under Jockey Club Rules is now allowed, the reason for stopping unauthorised meetings ceases to exist and the Defence of the Realm Regulation might be withdrawn.end(Sgd) A. H. STARIJSY.Board of Trade.12th November, 1918.
