A BASE IN BOHEMIA gOR AERIAL OPERATIONS AGAINST GERMANY.Copy of letter from Secretary,, Air Ministry, to Secretary, War Cabinet.AIR MINISTRY,Strand, W.C.2,No, B.6864 (C.A.S. ) 6th November, 1918.URGENT. Sir,In view of recent military developments and especially of the granting, by the Allies, of an armistlco to Austria-Hungary, certain important strategical questions connected with the employ-merit of the Royal Air fforce have arisors.     I am, therefore, commanded by the Air Council te inform you that close consideration is being given to these problems by th* Air Staff and to request that the following matter may be referred at the earliest possible moment to the War Cabinet for decision.On examination of the possible courses of action which the altered circumstances of the War may render advisable, the Air Cteif consider that, amongst ethers, an extension of the air operations, with a view to striking at new and hitherto inaccess-ible targets in the heart of Germany, is highly desirable and within practical reach, provided that some preliminary arrangements can be made.Highly important results would accrue from the employment against moral and industrial targets in Germany of as large a portion as possible of the aerial forces now released from Palestine and Mesopotamia, operating from bases in Bohemia, preferably in the vicinity of Prague.    Many important objectives can-bo reached from these bases, particularly Berlin whose distance does not exceed 150 miles.     These forces would&apos;also be in a position to attack from the rear the German Armies defending the Austro-German frontier and would act in conjunction with the Allied troops in that theatre.In order to render these proposals practicable it is ossen-tial to obtain information at the earliest possible moment as to the extent and nature of the landing grounds in Bohemia, as well as the concurrence and assistance of the authorities there. Arrangements have also to be made with them for the supply of petrol and oil.    A request for preliminary information in regard to these matters has been made to the Foreign Office and War Office.The establishment of such a base wauld have the additional advantage of enabling the squadrons operating from Nancy also to carry out raids on South Germany, as the machines, in plaa* of returning, could continue thoir passage/across[he Secretary,War Cabinet,2, Whitehall Gardens,
across Germany and land in Bohemia and vice versa. Further, the bombing cf military objectives at Berlin from bases in -England could be effected in the same manner.In view cf the great urgency of this matter and of the large amount of preliminary arrangements which must be made to carry those operations into el feet, and to take the earliest possible advantage of the present eituation, I am commanded to request that immediate Banction may be given for definite arrangements to be made by -the- chief of the Air Staff in consultation with the Chief of tho Imperial General Staff and Marshal Fo:h for carrying them into execution at the first favourable moment,1 amSir,Your obedient Servant, (ngd.)  -w.a. ROBINSON.  &apos;
