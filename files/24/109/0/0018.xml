I was unable to be present at the Cabinet on June 24th owing to the Committee on the Agriculture Bill.   I v/as also unable to be present at the Cabinet on 5th July owing to my attendance upon The King in Edinburgh.   I therefore had not an opportunity of stating my views on the probable effect in Scotland of the decisions then taien with regard to Lasd settlement,   I very much regret this.3.   I, of course, am bound loyally to accept these decisions. But I consider it essential that I should place on record at the earliest moment a plain statement of the effect on Scotland of the policy proposed and its relation to pre-election pledges.3.   Land settlement in Scotland cannot be considered solely &apos; from the point, of view of the demand for land which has arisen as the result of post-war conditions.   The history ef Scottish Land.Settlement is entirely different from the history of Land Settlement in England.4.   In Scotland Land Settlement has been a continuing process from 1886 up to the date of the war,   Then land settlement practically ceased, with the result that the post-war period was commenced with a large accumulation of applications which would in ordinary course have been dealt with during the years 1914-18.-    5. . tn addition post-war conditions brought forward a large number of applications bj ex-service men, to, meet which special legislation was enacted and special funds provided,,   JProm 1912 up to the present time the Board of Agriculture for Scotland have only baren able to satisfy 1,510 applicants for holdings and enlargements. -Of these 280 only are ex-service men.   To-day the Board have upon their books applications from 6,457 civilians and 4,576 ex-service men.   Additional applications are being received, including applications from ex-service men, to the number of about 20 per day,6.    The available funds which remain are estimated to be sufficient to provide holdings for 2,000 applicants as a maximum. If thege funds were utilised for ex-service men only, there would still remain 2,576 men of that class unprovided for, as well as  -the 6,457 civilian applicants already referred to.   Amongst;the -latter are included many who have lost near relatives in the war, and who consider that they have claims almost equal to those of ex-service men.7.   The rate of settlement has necessarily been slow, and the funds provided have been inadequate.   Drastic measures have therefore been adopted to secure land by ex-service men in many parts of Scotland on the-lines of &quot;direct action&quot;.   Land has been illegally seized by men who have grown tired of waiting, and who have come to distrust the many promises made that they would be provided with holdings on their native land.   The adoption of a policy to slow down or stop Land Settlement will, especially in the Highland districts., lead to a condition of affairs which I contemplate with the gravest concern and indeed apprehension.
8.&apos;  At the present time there are 13 farms which have &quot;been illegally taken possession of by ex-service men.   In many cases the tenants&apos;&apos; stocfc has been turned off, fences have been destroyed and houses ,-actually erected.   There have also been brought to my notice 29 cases (representing about boo individual ex-service men) where definite threats to take possession of land forcibly have been made.   In most of these cases I am satisfied action will follow unless Land, settlement proceeds generously and expedi-tiously. .     :;9.   It may be that the Law should be enforced in cases such as&apos;those.I have mentioned.   I can assure my colleagues that any attempt to enforce the Law at the present time would meet with active and violent.resistance which, having regard to the many definite&apos; statements that land would, be provided, for ex-service men, would command the sympathy of a very large section of the community in.Scotland.   Further, in Scotland the pro-vision of land, particularly in the Highland districts, is an economic necessity if a population is to be maintained in these districts under tolerable conditions.10* &apos; A mitigation /of the situation might be obtained by materially augmenting the Agriculture (Scotland) .  Fund, the Income ef which at the present time stands at  215,000 annually.   This Fund was created to provide for the development of Agriculture and of Agricultural Education and Research as well as for Land settlement purposes the demands upon the Fund, however, in regard to the former requirements have so increased as to absorb the larger proportion of the Fund, and the. amount re-   . maining available for Land settlement is consequently of little importance in&apos;; light of the magnitude of the problem.   Moreover, the value of the Fund is less by at least bo% to-day than it was at the date .(1911-) when . it was first created.   An addition of say  300,000 annually might enable the Board to deal with the more pressing and dangerous cases.   Additional relief would be afforded by reverting-to the method of acquiring properties by way of rent charge instead of by capital payment.11*   I commend the foregoing considerations to the earnest consideration of my colleagues.   In my opinion the cessation of Land settlement would,not only raise serious - - political issues, but would also create a dangerous ,social situation,   within my recollection gun boats had to be sent to the West of Scotland to quell land riots.   History will, I am convinced, repeat itself and shooting will take place in Scotland as surely as in Ireland if the policy proposed is rigorously pursued.12.   I append.to this memorandum:-(1) an extract from the Coalition Manifesto, dated 22nd lovembcr, 1918;(2) An extract from a speech by the prime Minister at rrolverhampton on 25th November, 1918;(3) an extract.from the. prime Minister&apos;3 statement of policy issued pan 6th December, 1919 - all of which bear upon the attitude of the Government towards Land settlement, and none of which I venture to think can be fully reconciled with the policy now proposed.Scottish Office, 13th July, 1920-(Sgd.)

APPENDIX to C,P.1617*1? EXTRACT FROM THE COALITION MANIFESTO DATED 22ndLAND FOR SOLDIERS.The care of the soldiers and sailors, officers and men, whose heroism has won for us this great deliverance and who return to civil life,, is a primary obligation of patriotism, and the Government will endeavour to assist such members of the .armed forces of the Crown as may desire to avail themselves of facilities for special industrial training and to return to civil life under conditions worthy of their services to the country^Plans have been prepared, and will be put into execution as soon as the new Parliament assembles, whereby it will bo the duty of public authorities and, if necessary, of the State itself to acqxiire land on simple and economical base3 for men who have served in the war, either for cottages with gardens9 allotments or small holdings, as the-applicants may desire and may be suited for, with grants provided to assist in training and in initial equipment. In addition to this, we intend to secure and to promote the further development and cultivation of allotments and small holdings generally, so far as may be required in the public interest.2; EXTRACT FROM A SPEECH 3Y THE PRII^E MINISTER &quot;ATThere must be a scheme for settling the gallant soldiers and sailors on the land.    Those of us who have ?^ead the history of Rome, know h&amp;w this was a problem which always came up after every war, and how the soldiers who had been settled on the land through lack in balance in tackling the problems brought about a general failure, at the end of every war  in achieving the purpose to redeem the promises they were given.........Then you must have a grant for thepurpose of the necessary land and for the equipment of the -holdings. The State must assist in the equipment%where tho man is a vigorous, healthy, intelligent fellow, who would bo able to run the holding. You know that whatever the grant, it will be small compared with tho cost of the war.5* EXTRACT FROg THE PRIME MINISTER!S state-: NT 01&apos; POLICY - ISSUED 0FTEO3SUHBEH7&apos; 1918.Wt  II IMP . i If *n     &quot;III.-WF&quot; .   -. - hi-mn^ i. in. i simple I   t &quot;*There is generally a groat anxiety expressed by multi^&apos; altitudes of our soldiers for settling on the land.     It is a happy aspiration and one that conforms in the highest degreewith the interests of the State.......The Government havealready great schemes necessarily involving a large expcndl-ture of public money for the purpose of land for soldiers who desire to earn a&apos;living in cultivation.    There will be pro-vision for ex-service men for-either small holdings, cottage sites and garden holdings or allotments on lease , according to the choice^which they like, and the fitness which they show. Provision has boon made for building houses, mo&quot;money has been set aside for the provision of equipment and cultivation of the land, and credit will be provided,on easy terms for the stocking of the land.    Facilities will be provided to enable tenants to purchase their holdings. &apos;
