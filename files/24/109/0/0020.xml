London, W.&apos;l.7th July, 1920.My dear Mr. Balfour,I write to you on another point which has been brought to my notice in connection with the repatriation of prisoners of war.As I explained to you in the Memorandum vhich I sent to you the other day, in the expanded use of the Baltic : routes during the present summer months lies the only hope of repatriating large numbers of prisoners before next winter, It was for that reason that I urged so strongly that the British Government should be asked to reverse its decision on the subject of the appropriation of the funds at the disposal of the Inte:natioaal Committee on Relief Credits, and that Dr. NansenTs requests to this Committee, should be complied vi thAt present the Baltic routes are actually in operation, and considerable numbers of prisoners are being taken to their homes.   The sea transport is being carried on in seven small ex-German ships which have been released for thepurpose
purpose:to the German.Government by the Maritime service of the Reparations Commission.   The financial: programme put forward at Dr. Jansenfs. request to the3 International Committee on Relief Credits was based on the assumption that the German Government would be allowed to continue using these ships during&apos;the present season..- that. is to say, roughly until the end cf October.   I understand, ho v^ver, that there, is a possibility that the,present arrangement, may shortly.be brought under review, and I, therefore, write to. submit to you the desirability of leaving these seven ships in the service in which they are now engaged.I hope you will, not think that in putting this forward;in addition to what I have previously said about the Relief Credits, I am pressing for too much from the British Government, I believe that In the case of the shipping required for the Baltic routes, the case for allowing the present arrangement to continue for the next two or three months is on its merits overwhelmingly strong.;In the first place, any change.in the present arrangement ,would mean a dislocation of the service, with consequent very serious overcrowding of prisoner Camps at the Ports of embarkation, and possibly the subsequent stoppage of the train.service from Central Russia to the Ports.It.would.in the second place, probably means running whdt-ever ships were used with.British crews, which, for the transport of exr-enemy ;prisoners, introduces new and.undesirable complications. It would further mean that additional funds would have to be found: the cost of chartering sufficient shipping for carrying out Dr. Uansen!s programme for the/Baltic Ports during the,next three or four months could not be less than ,, 150, QOC, and :this, .in addition to what Dr..toanssn has already asked for from the Internationl Committee on.belief Credits, would, I am afraid, be very hard to find*For all these reasons :I venture to hope that /you will consider *rery carefully whether ,it ,is not worth while getting adecision
ascisiwi by the Cabinet or by the Cabinet Committee that the pre-sent arrangement with regard to the seven ships at present in service may be allowed to stand, and that this decision may be brought to the to^ledge of the Ministry of Shipping.Such a decision would be very much in accordance with the general policy of the foreign Office towards this question, if this generaly policy is at all represented by Lord CursonTs speeches at both the private and public Meetings of the Council when Dr. Nansen reported on the matter.We are very grateful to you for your letter to the Chancellor of the Exchequer on the subject of the Relief Credits-, and I hope ybii will give this new request the same consideration.Yours sincerely,(3d.) BRIG DRUMMOND.  &apos;The Right Hon. A.J.. Balfour, O.M., M.P., 4, Carltsm Gardenst Pall Mall.,- g *
Copy, let ter X*-2m ^ tAlll Balfoiy to Sir Joseph Mao lag;.July 11th,I am not sure how far you are acquainted with what has been, and is being, done by Dr. Nansen .under the,auspices of the&apos;.&apos;League of Nations, for&quot; the repatriation of prisoners of war-a great and beneficent work-,   ; If you have at all followed ou  the matter, you will know how important is the question raised-in r/ae enclosed letter by the Secretary General of the League cf Nations - Sir Eric Druwiond.     I shall be most, graceful oc you if you can make the necessary arrangements for carrying out. his wishes.     I am, of course, quite ready to bring tne matter before the Cabinet;   but if;you agree with the proposed policy I should hardly think that this was necessary,.     If there is any point on which you are in doubt the Secretariat of the League of Nations, Sunderiand House, Curzon Street, will give you every information.Yours very sincerely,P.S.        I fancy time rather presses.Ill,Copy of letter from Sir J. Maclay to Mr. A.0J. Balfour.Ministry of Shipping, St. James&apos;s Park, &apos; London, S   . 1.14th July, 1920.My dear Mr. Balfour,In reply to your note of the 11th July, it is correct that the Maritime&apos;Service of the Reparations Commission allowed the Geimaus temporarily to retain seven ships for the Prisoner of Wax- Repatriation Service in the BalticP They intended only to .leave these ships for a few weeks&quot; in order to clear the congestion of prisoners in the camps near Narva.The whole question is really a financial one.     Our contention is that the cost of these and similar services should be borne jointly by the Allies, which would be achieved if the cost of repatriation were borne by the International Committee on the relief credits..If these ships are left at the disposal of the Germans,, the result will be to throw a double financial burden on Great Britain^   The seven ships concerned would all come to Great Britain,, so that by leaving them at the disposal of the
Germans we are foregoing the earnings of these steamers for several months and at the same time subscribing our share to the relief credits.On the other points I am in agreement with,Sir &quot;Eric Drummond; but once the financial question ifc settled, I am convinced that the remaining difficulties can easily be overcome, for instance, on the question o the manning of the steamers:, we could probably arrange to chaiu(-/.&apos;&quot;;.he same vessels after delivery to the Internax:unal Red Cross oh a&apos;bare boat basis^ leaving them to arrange with the German Government for the manning and running of the vessels-These are my views on the matter which is; however really in the- hands of the Foreign Office and Treasury, because , as I said,, the diff ieuluies are not shipping difficultiesi but financial ones;Yours very sincerely,The Right Honourable A..I. Balfour.(Signed)   J. Maclay.
