This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.SECRET. *&apos; c.p., 1 669    Xi.....THE CABINET.WORKS IN PALESTINE.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.I circulate a memorandum by the Master-General of the Ordnance showing the Egypt 16 minimum requirements for land purchase and for accommodation to tide over the coming     371 winter in Palestine.*- w. s. c.The War Office,22nd July, 1920.1. Since 31st Ma)7,1920, the situation in Asia Minor has developed considerably and there seems little possibility of any material reduction of the garrison of Palestine in the next few months.   The strength of the troops is, in round figures ; Men.British       .........      .........   10,000Native..................   18,000 ,Total      ...      .........   28,0002. It is essential to provide shelter against the winter of 1920-21 for this number, less any who can be billeted or for whom shelter has already been provided. Since it is now too late for any semi-permanent huts to be manufactured and delivered on site before the middle of the rainy season some other measures must be taken to meet the emergency.3. The General Officer Commanding, Egypt (telegram C-in-C. No. 8205, dated 5th June, 1920), has asked for 2,000 Nissen or Webb-Lee huts &apos;and 150 Armstrong (officers) huts to accommodate the present garrison, and also that the delivery of huts which are suitable for occupation all the year round may not be delayed.4. From enquiries made it appears that we shall have to buy back from contractors about half this number which have already been sold to them by the Disposal Board. It will cost less to do so than to purchase new Nissen or similar type huts at the present date ; moreover, it would not be possible to manufacture such huts in time. The balance will be provided by taking down, repairing, and transporting sectional huts available in empty camps in England. This matter is being dealt with in conjunction with the Director of Army Contracts.5. The cash provision in the Estimates, 1920-21, is: - -     Works, Parts I. and II. (new works)...... 750,000,,    Part III. (maintenance)       ...      ...  200,000Land purchase............... 200,000of which only 120,000Z. has been allotted provisionally to General Officer Commanding, Egypt, for Part III.
6. Approval is urgently required for the following (cash) expenditure: Accommodation. (a.) Temporary winter hutting, equivalent to 2,000(Nissen, &amp;c.)        ...    : ... &apos; !  .&apos;.....  100,000 1 ,.,(b.) 200 single men&apos;s barrack huts (semi-permanent y   ? &amp;       ,4pe).........      ...      ...      ...*220,00oj    ^Eng^d.(c.) Erection of huts, necessary buildings, road work incamps, water supply, lighting, &amp;c.        ...      ...  150,000   expenditureAdd for land and sea transport      ...      ......    74,000     in Palestine.Total accommodation   ......  544,000Land purchase Purchase of sites for cantonments at Ludd and Jenin   40,000Total land       .......*.    40,0007. The provision of further accommodation of a semi-permanent type, in the form of hospitals, married officers&apos; and soldiers&apos; quarters, officers&apos; quarters for a portion of the garrison will be taken up later.8. It will be noted that the cost of these proposals for accommodation and land purchase only represents less than 21/. per head of the troops (584,000?. for 28,000 men), To house men semi-permanently with all accessories in cantonments, would cost over 300/. a head.* Figure based on tenders, received, the figure being increased by 10 per cent, on account of the delay in acceptance and rise in prices. *
