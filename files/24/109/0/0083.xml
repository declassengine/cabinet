^MLRocunient h thH&apos;? Drltaf^T:1 -^KPerty of/ .) I. I.Circulated by the Secretary of State for India. SECRET.itMESOPOTAMIAN  ADMINISTRATION.Memorandum by Secretary or State for India.G&quot;N^ nere are two points connected with the administration of Mesopotamia.which ve bulked very largely in recent discussions, and on which I wish to offer a few remarks. One is the cost ol: the army, the other the so-called &quot; Indianisation &quot; of the administration.(1) We are all agreed that the cost of the Army is excessive. The point with which I want to deal is the suggestion that the army of occupation, if the area to be occupied is not reduced,, must cost what it costs now. The present strength (including the troops in North-West Persia) is two divisions, five infantry brigades, and one cavalry brigade. Successive Corn-man ders-in-Chief have estimated that, if all went well, a reduction to one division, plus one cavalry and one infantry brigade, or even less, would eventually be possible. But in the meantime the righting value of the larger force is, I am informed, no greater than that of the smaller one. Many battalions are being used to guard Turkish prisoners and Assyrian refugees. All regiments are more or less below strength when it was necessary to reinforce, the force in North-West Persia a few weeks ago the two battalions sent up numbered only 300 men each-owing to the demands on them for administrative services. All this is abnormal, and, it is to be hoped, temporary ; money is being spent for which no military return is being received, and which, it will no longer be necessary to spend when the adminis-tration settles down. Again, the administrative services, which&apos;are not really military in their nature, not only use up troops, but are in themselves enormously costly. The General Officer Commanding thinks it necessary to maintain a huge Inland Water Transport Department. The wage bill alone of this Department is over 200,0001. a month, and Lord Inchcape, in his report to the Minister of Munitions, wrote that, from what he had heard, the fleet being retained by the military administration &quot;is &quot; much in excess of what might be considered a reasonable reserve . . . If the &quot; fleet were disposed of, a very expensive establishment could be demobilised.&quot;I more than suspect that the whole of the military administration is run on a similarly lavish scale. &quot;It is a sin and a shame,&quot; writes a very competent observer privately to a friend, &quot; that money should be wasted in the way that it is here. &quot; Practically nothing is being done &quot;to build permanent, or temporary, quarters for &quot; people of less consideration, but practically anybody can get a car when he likes &quot; to go six miles to the Sporting Club and back. The streets are still crowded at &quot; all times of the day with motor vehicles containing officers with their wives. &quot; Reductions are being effected in the strength of units, but these swollen administrative staffs, living under conditions far more luxurious then they will ever see again, even if they go to Simla or Delhi, remain. We have an effective strength of about a division and a quarter, which is divided up for the purpose of &quot; administration into two divisions, and two lines of communication areas  &quot; all of them with, large staffs, with an enormous General Headquarters on &quot; top.&quot; These conditions will be aggravated if the desire of the Imperial General Staff (which the General Officer Commanding has not asked for) to send three more brigades from India is persisted in-; and it is conditions like these that are making our rule unpopular with the people, whose habits are disturbed and whose houses are occupied by the military. I receive constant repre-sentations on this subject. Again, the hill station wliich has been established in Persian territory and to which the General Officer Commanding and the whole of the Headquarters Staff and heads of departments withdrew on the outbreak of trouble in the Mosul vilayet last month, leaving only a Lieutenant-Colonel to represent them at Baghdad, the seat of government is an example of what I believe to be wholly unnecessary expenditure. At all events it has caused very unfavourable comments in Baghdad, and Sir A. Wilson tells me that he has had to use his influence to dissuade the Chamber of Commerce from making a public protest against what they consider to.be. extravagant and wasteful expenditure in this and other respects.Iam most anxious to support the Secretary of State for War in his desire to reduce the expenditure and the army, but before it is decided that the former cannot be reduced without reducing or withdrawing the latter, I suggest that a searching enquiry should be instituted into present methods of military expenditure.

\9 \ &apos;. :iLi(2) I am not quite sure what &quot; Indianisatiou &quot; is intended to mean. But I take it to mean that a direct administration has been set up on the model of India, and even&apos; manned by Indians--that we are, in fact, governing Mesopotamia as though it&apos; were an Indian province. And the argument is that this involves a costly administration, which involves heavy taxation, which in turn brings in its train the unrest of which Mesopotamia is now supposed to be the scene. Ergo, get rid of Sir A. T. Wilson and peace and contentment will reign once more.   Now for the facts.With the progress of our victorious armies the existing Turkish administration disappeared. Though not a bad system on paper, it was entirely inefficient in practice. Nevertheless it had given to the dwellers in towns some semblance of. Civilisation. There were law courts, from which there was an appeal to Constantinople ; and there was an electoral system under which&apos; not only municipalites were worked, but members were sent to the Turkish Parliament. The Iraq was, in fact, a part like any other of the Ottoman Empire. But all this collapsed, because the higher officials were exclusively Turks and fled, and the minor Arab officials  who either were Turkish in sympathies or were not sure that the Turk would not return also disappeared. It was necessary to replace the machinery by some-thing else-for two reasons. First, because we could not give the inhabitants, of whom we posed as the liberators, a worse administration than they h.ad endured before. Second, because it would have been impossible to conduct a campaign in a country given over to chaos security was necessary on. the lines of communications, and the army had as far as possible to feed itself. I mention these points because, obvious though they are, they are often forgotten. But to create a new administration there existed practically no material but what we brought with us and that consisted mainly of British officers from India and Indian subordinates. Every effort has been made to get officials from Egypt and the Soudan the Judicial Secretary and the Director of Educa-tion come from the former: but there was no large reserve to draw upon, except in India. Nevertheless the Turkish system has been, maintained in its main features-except that of inefficiency. It would not be surprising if men, whose administrative experience had been Indian tended to work to an Indian model and to an Indian standard and I am willing to admit that we have gone further in the direction of efficiency than the Arab State is likely to want to go. But when that admission is made it must be remembered that it is largely for military purposes that this expensive administration was created and that this degree of efficiency has been maintained. The great expansion in the cultivated area, for example, which in turn necessitated an extension of irrigation, was undertaken at army expense in response to an urgent appeal from home to make the army self-supporting. Again, a feature of the present year is the transfer to the civil administration of expensive departments hitherto organised by and for the military authorities, such as railways, ports, docks, river navigation. Departments which exist solely for the benefit of the inhabitants bv no means attain the same standard. Education, for example, is notoriously behindhand. Though Arabic is the language of the schools, and for the first time since the Turkish conquest the Shiah. majority of the population is getting its due share, it has been impossible to satisfy the demand, because the supply of Arab schoolmasters is wholly insufficient. Technical education in Baghdad is at a standstill because the military are occupying the only possible buildings, and the prolonged and persistent efforts of the Civil Commissioner have failed to dislodge them. Facts like these caused a Syrian nationalist paper recently to remark in all earnest that the Mesopotamians did not appreciate the blessings of Turkish rule until they had lost them.But, it is said, your administration is absurdly costly compared with that of the Turks because &quot; it has 450 British executive officers running it, and not a single &quot; responsible Mesopotamian. In Turkish clays 70 per cent, of the executive civil &quot; service was local&quot; (Mr. T. E. Lawrence, Times, 23rd July). I cannot say what percentage of the total is represented by the 450 British, though I doubt whether it is as much asoO. But it must be pointed out that the Turks did not employ &quot;a single responsible Mesopotamian.&quot; The Turkish subordinate executive service too was almost exclusively Sunni, while the majority of the people are Shiah. It was easier for a foreign Moslem Power to impose a Sunni domination than for ourselves ; and the result has been that most of the Sunni employees of the Turks who have remained or returned, are unemployable, while the Shiahs, who had no training in or tradition of public life in Turkish times, nre not yet generally capable,&apos;or areunwillmgyM;-to come forward to take their places. Where the material has been available it has been used to the utmost. In the Judicial Department, for example&apos;,&apos;&apos;out of TOO officials six are British and 82 Arab, and for the first time for-centuriesjustice is being - &quot;;&apos; administered in the Arabic tongue, and the courts are following the law arid customs
with which the people are familiar. In this connection it may be noted that Mr. Lawrence&apos;s statement that the administration generally is conducted in English is untrue. There is hardly a British officer on the executive stall who is not qualified in colloquial Arabic.The revenue of.Mesopotamia was collected last year.at a cost of 16 percent.  not excessive, seeing that in India, after three quarters of a century of settled government, tho cost was 13 per cent. No figures are available for a comparison with Turkish times, but it is clear that the&apos; Turkish system must have been exceedingly costly. No less than six different departments, with separate establish-ments, independently collected revenue and remitted it to Constantinople. Moreover, almost all branches of revenue were farmed a system which is notoriously uneco-nomical to the State and burdensome to the taxpayer. It is, therefore, perhaps not surprising that until the last two years before the war there was a deficit in the Mesopotamian budget.At all events, it is said, the Turks took much less out of the people than you are taking; the Turkish revenue was 2\millions, and you are taking six. No figures of Turkish revenue are available here, and 1 am unable to trace the 2\ millions to any higher authority than the Daily Mail. The revenue budgeted for in the current year is about 4f- millions (at 2s. to the rupee). Of this sum 2\ millions are furnished by customs, the rates being the same as under the Turks, and all other heads of revenue combine to make a little over two millions.In 1919-20 the corresponding figures (at the same rate of exchange) were :-Total revenue 4,142,00OL, customs 2,202,0001, remaining heads 1,940,000L The land revenue in 1919-20 yielded 1,508,0007., for 1920-21 the estimate is 1,581,0001. Mr. Ormsby Gore, in his admirable speech in the House of Commons debate, sought to make the point that the revenue had &quot;jumped from a little over l,O00,000Z. in 1918-19 to 5,000,OOOL in 1919-20; but he had failed to notice that his figures for: 1918-19 were for Baghdad only, while those for 1919-20 were for Baghdad, Basra and Mosul. Can it reasonably be said that a taxation revenue of 2,000,O00L is excessive for the whole of Mesopotamia ? We are told that it is larger than the Turks&apos; revenue, and that is probably true but the explanation is simple. First, the area under cultivation is now some 15 per cent, or 20 per cent, greater than it was in Turkish times. Second, the price of grain is something like 300 per cent, higher, than it was before the war. In point of fact, the Turkish land revenue assessments have almost everywhere been reduced. In the. Hillah division, for example, the Turkish demand was as much as 60 per cent, of the gross produce on some classes of land: we have reduced it to 30 per cent, or even 25 per cent., with a rebate of 3 per cent, for prompt payment. It is truefhat in certain areas taxation and control are being-imposed ou tribes which have never submitted to either. Over the Shamiyeh division, for example, where the recent trouble has been, the Turks had exercised no control for 10 years before the war. But our rate of taxation has always been tempered to the degree of control exercised, and it is noteworthy that the Muntafiks division from which in the early days no revenue whatever was collected, and on which a demand was made only last year has not joined in the recent outbreak,, and that in the Amarah division such confidence and contentment prevail that the tribesmen have voluntarily surrendered 24,000 rifles. The Arab likes taxation as little as anyone else, but there is no evidence that excessive taxation is one of the contributory, causes of the present unrest.I grant your administration, says Mr. Lawrence : &quot; We had to set up a.war-time &quot; administration. AVe had no choice ; but that was two years ago, and .we have not &quot; yet changed to peace conditions. Indeed, there are yet no signs of change.&quot; For that, at least, I admit no responsibility either for myself or for Sir Arnold Wilson. Mr. Lawrence perhaps forgets that, juridically the. position is the same as it was two years ago. Mesopotamia is still Turkish territory, and as such is still administered, under international law, by the army of occupation. It is only two months ago that the mandate was granted to us. Technically, therefore, our attitude has been correct. That it has been in the highest degree inexpedient no one can doubt. More than, once since 1917 the Civil Commissioner had pressed for the despatch of a Commission to examine political conditions on the spot; and. for at least a year past it has been perfectly evident that it was essential to make a move in fulfilment of the pledges;given, -by tHis,MMajesty&apos;s;,Government,... In.,November last, year the India Office put forward a draft sketch, of an Arab Government,-and urged that an immediate announcement should be made. Though Lord, Curzon in his telegram to, Sir P. Cox. of 14th November agreed &quot;We are strongly of opinion that something must be said without delay &quot; it was not until 4th May this year that a formula was arrived
at. This was not for lack of reminders on the part of the India Office. On 15th December we had proposed to the Foreign Office to authorise an announcement, but by 19th February no reply had been&apos; received, and eventually the first step was taken by Sir A. Wilson himself. He had appointed, on his own motion, a committee  presided over by a judicial officer of.the Egyptian Service to draw up a constitution ; at the end of April be telegraphed a summary of their recommendations ; and he pressed for permission to announce, before Ramazan (when tempers become excited by fasting), that His Majesty&apos;s Government provisionally approved them and instructed him to communicate them to the leading inhabitants with a view to giving effect to them in the autumn; the India Office did their best, but Sir A. Wilson received no instructions until the 7th June. In addition to this delay, further delay has been imposed upon his active proposals. Though a late convert to the policy of an Arab Government, he has shown himself anxious energetically to pursue the policy which he has been authorised to announce. Accordingly he proposed to receive Jaafar Pasha from Syria, and to invite a number of Mesopotamia^ officers now in that country the officers of whose, natural impatience to take a share in the government Mr. Lawrence reminds us in the Times to come to Baghdad for consultation regarding the preliminary arrangements. But, at the wish of the Foreign Office, he was immediately restrained, and action of that kind so important at the present stage is being held up.In conclusion, since Sir A. Wilson&apos;s administration has suddenly become the object of hostile-and in my opinion wholly unmerited criticism, I will quote from a telegram which I sent to him as recently as 7th June, with Lord Curzon&apos;s concur-rence: i(His Majesty&apos;s Government take this opportunity of conveying to you their &quot; most cordial and grateful acknowledgments of the high ability and unflagging zeal &quot; with which during the past 2\ years you have devoted yourself with such markedly &quot;successful results to your, difficult and laborious task.&quot; Nemo repente fit deterrimus!E. S. M.23rd July 1920.P.S. I append the latest telegram from Sir A. Wilson : From Civil Commissioner, Baghdad, 21st July 1920. (Received 22nd, 8 a.m.)Clear the line.(R.)   8785.   General Officer Commanding-in-Chiefs telegram of the 15th July,.. X. 958, was written after personal discussion with me as statement of military position had my.general concurrence.I am hopeful, however, that our success at Rumaitha will restore situation sufficiently to enable us, with assistance of brigade from India already promised, to deal effectively with Shamiyah, from which trouble at Rumaitha was undoubtedly fomented originally, and to maintain our present position in this country. Rising is still quite local in character, isolated political officers on edge of district affected at Afek Qilat, Sikar, Shattra, where no troops have ever yet been seen, are maintaining their authority and collecting revenue as usual. Latest reports are that rising in. Shamiyah Division lacks unanimity and fighting in that area up to date is reported to be largely inter-tribal.Political situation reports from other districts satisfactory, but Billah reports indication of some nervousness among tribes at delay in taking action against rebels in Shamiyah.Military position in the event of a spread &quot;of the disaffection to other areas would, however, be as described by Gen. Haldane. My only doubt is whether evacuation of Mosul would not raise such a storm as to compel us to withdraw still further (see my telegram No. 1975 of 13th. February). Abandonment of Mosul involves abandonment also of Arbil and Sulaimaniyah, for last two named Divisions are absolutely quiet they would not I fear long remain so were we to abandon Mosul. We now have no garrison at Arbil. Garrison of Sulaimaniyah Division consists of about 600 rifles and 2 guns at ( ? ) some 30 miles west of Sulaimaniyah on borders of Division. ; His Majesty&apos;s Government will realise from this that it is not a case of holding down&apos;these Divisions by armed force but providing, as in Turkish times, a minimum, shqw off authority in support of the Government. * \
