iTilsjbo Its 3 &quot;.thePropertofofs Government.SECRET.MINISTRY  OF   POOD.Statistical Statement for Month of June 1920.Seasonal movements of cereal stocks were satisfactory in view of the approaching end of the cereal year. In the case of&apos; all the other principal foods and feeding-stuffs the. stocks position of the.United Kingdom improved during the month with the exception, of butchers&apos; meat. Home supplies of the latter were very short during June, owing to,an anticipation of higher.prices for producers on the removal of control, but heavy, stocks of imported meat remain in store.The statistics collected by the Ministry of Labour as on July- 1st show a further advance in average retail food prices, the percentage increase since July, 1914, rising from 155.on June. 1st to 158 on July 1st. Decreases in butter, margarine, and teaiwere more, than balanced by advances in fish and: eggs, and an abnormal seasonal increase in potatoes;Table A.-Summary for June.,Commodity.Stock,.
