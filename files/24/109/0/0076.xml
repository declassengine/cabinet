The proposal to increase faros during the holiday period has moved public opinion far more than the question appears&quot; to warrant.The most serious event in the week has been the reported issue of printod instructions to tTholesale Co-operative branches for mobilisation in support of strikers.   They have greatly increased their stock of food and are busy purchasing motor lorries.   There is some opposition on the part of the members, who do not think their funds should be spent in political action.A very large body of Labour is opposed to Direct Action for Ireland and a ballot of the rank and file, fairly conducted, would almost certainly result in the rejection of the proposal.The cost of living and tho prospect of increased rents, together with unemployment, are causing much discontent, quite apart from the claims for higher wages.   The miners are preparing for a strike and are secretly asking for the help of tho Transport Y/orkers, who have themselves lodged another claim for their Canal Workers.The 3nginoering, Foundry and Ship-building industries are dissatisfied with the decision of the Industrial Court and a local H strike has already broken out in tho North-east,The new Communist Party i3 trying to form in every works a small Communist nucleus to undermine the authority of. the Trade Union officials.Ilany of the Labour Offioials aro about to start for International Conferencos abroad.The condition of Ireland is becoming worse.
$here has teen/an important development &quot;arising out of the formation of ,a General Staff for J&amp;bour.    It is Relieved that the heads of the Co-operative Societies have Issued ft sort of mobilisation order , printed in Manchesterrand cirou^^ *a*1    provisioning strikers during the ne*t strike.    It is known &quot;thatihe s^oieW&apos;^ofisiwe bee* aiioti^daie^ -ere&quot; Very large and that the Cc-eparative^^ lorries toa great extent,    li ishoped t^t in a few day a copy of this secret document iaay ie oH&amp;ined.   is in ^he different of a keyviindustry strike if may&apos; b&apos;i necessary to commandeer stocks of food, it is important &quot;to toaow whore these &quot;are and to be In a position to enforce any order that may he made for commandeering them In the public Interest.   At the same time, it wouii W ienefioiaX to encourage the movement shown at Manonester and &quot;elsewhere against allowing Co-operative Wholesale funds to be used for poiitibal purposes.   At a recent quarterly meeting of Oo-eperatlve directors, at Manchester a resolution that the resources of the Society he used In this way was defeated by a majority of .419.If a big strike now occurs and the Co-operative Societies are able to feed tine strikers watte the rest of the country goes short, it will be the most important oriels that has yet occurred in the modern industrial position. On the other hand,&apos;&quot;e? victory     law e^ order would have a stabllisinf effect that may be felt for a generation..,, .....   .*.-    * f    UiiJ-Viw Uw   si .j 4 .&apos;j/$he feeling irpuaedhy. the proposed increase during the holiday time seetmi to be occupying the public mind to the^ exclusion of fa^ Shis Is-.1...: : - -I^iftioularly/
LABOUR mDIRECTAGT10H %(B IHBLalG).The consensus, of opinion among my correspondents is that a very large body of workers is opposed to a general strike, on behalf of Ireland.    In view of the $rare jU&amp;portanoe of the^issue I *i?ire. the reports of my oorrespo: at sotae length.Glasgow and the West of Scotland:The decision of the Trades &quot;Onion Congress to take a ballot- an &quot;the ^es^idh&apos; of strike . . action to force the hand of the Government in regard to Ireland and Jtas,sia is. received with great satisfaction by:ttie\ revolutionary elements in Scotland.    The local trades opuncils by a majori are. also in agreement with, the policy expressed -&apos;&apos;&quot;-*&apos;-:at;-the- Congress, having Iby resolution&apos; carried similar opinions.       ,It is, however, very doubtful indeed whether stj action Would he: carried by a proper ballot of the workers.    As a matter of fact the attitude of the great majority of the workers in Scotland towardsIreland/particularly unfortunate now that we seem to be on the evi of a &quot;big  industrial struggle of!THE RPS3IAK ERAPIBP DELEGATION AND TEE &quot;DAILY HERALD&quot;There Is ,now direct evidence that the &quot;Dftily Herald&quot; to receive a subsidy from the Soviet Oovermeiit through th Russian Trading Delegation, members of whioh, with the exception of Eraesin, are breaking their undertaking. Tki proposed subsidy will give the &quot;Heraldff a new leaee of lifi and make it the paid agent of the Soviet Government* The subsidy appears to fcaye been obtained through a threat on...... the-part, of Mr, I&amp;ashuary that he would be obliged to inoliitowards the Bight if his paper was to Iceep alive, v - A person who is very well ao^ualntea with conditions the East End of London states that there is much leas talk of revolution there than six months ago.    The talk at tfcfl*r??&amp;&amp;V03*        policy:;tQi  &amp;Hl%%Mm       Mi*0? t  &apos; -present moment is confined principally to the Jews, thougl . Mr, Lansbury is undoubtedly a disturbing influence.
Ireland and Russia is one of indifference. They do not see why they should be the butt for every political squabble taking place throughout the world, and moreover the majority do not like a strike at any time, excepting for a cause which directly affects their own welfare. This indifference towards political issues causes much heartburning among the advanced revolutionary orators, who always complain that their long looked for revolution cannot take place until the workers take more interest in these matters,  instead of football and horseracing.

Tyneside: 

The majority of trade unionists would not support direct action.

Apart from the extreme section and the Irish section very little support would be given to such movement, but the danger of the vote going in favour of such a course lies in the fact that whilst the ordinary level-headed Trade Unionist would not trouble in the matter, the supporters of the cause and the Irish section would avail themselves of the opportunity of advancing their views by recording a vote in favour of direct action.

Lancashire:

We do not think for a moment that so far as Lancashire is concerned and especially any attempt to bring about a general strike of the  workers would meet with any degree of success. The general view taken is that these are political questions which can be settled by political action alone. Trade Unionists in this area are very sharply divided indeed on this direct action issue, with the great majority against on matters of this kindi. They understand that the effects of such action fall on them and it is mostly the extremists who favour its use. The great mass of the workers are against it, but of course, the majority are quiet and do not assert themselves like the extremists do and therefore their view does not appear to count if a ballot was taken and it would count if a general strike was called because they would refuse to come out and the leaders know it. The general strike threat here is regarded as bluff by the vast proportion of the workers and it is well known the cotton operatives are against it. They have too much to lose just at present. Lancashire workers will strike for more money, but they  will think twice before striking for something which might mean their losing money in loss of wages.

Yorkshire: 

Whilst going through mining areas during the/
the week I found very little interest was being taken by the rank and file in the doings of the Conference and several whom I conversed with knew nothing about it.   The newspapers are eagerly perused for cricket and racing news .but after that are thrown aside.   Ballot papers on directU action are to he sent out this week, but it Is impossible at yet to gauge the strength of the silent section who will rote against a political strike.*i In the textile districts, Ben Turner by way of the official Union sheet carries; on a steady pro-Bolshevik propaganda but nothing has yet transpired with regard to ballotting on the Trades Union Congress decision.   In engineering circles and railway branches nothing is moving in this direction, as yet.   Among the unskilled workers the lieutenants of Messrs. Clynes, Thome &amp; 0&apos;Grady, who are in charge of the local branches, have got to work immediately, urging their members through various cbannels to vote down the mad decisions of the Trades Union Congress.On the whole, owing to lack cf machinery to put their ease; the direct actionists should be easily swamped when the Press gets to work against the ballot in favour of a political strike.West MidlandsThere is very little talk amongst the miners concerning tho Tdireot actionf threat.   Bot one nan in fifty he s any knowledge of national politics and it is absurd to think that this threat is coming from the rank and file.   It is different, however, as regards the wage question and they certainly seem anxious to fight the Government over this.frOflftfffl (fellwaymenjThe circular from the Head Office, asking Branches to consider the policy of &apos;Dowa Tools1v in order to foroe the Government to withdraw troops from Ireland, was read at Clerkenwell, and, on account of the small attendance. It was agreed to hold a special meeting next Friday, in the meantime every member off duty was to be urged to attend.   Tfteti Branch Secretary warned them not to.be too sure of the support of the Bank apd ffile.  He &quot;knew quite a lot of feeling existed outside the branch room; that they were sick  of Ireland; and men would absolutely refuse to come cut on the question.London (Bleotrloians)The returns so far received of the ballot on the question of a general strike for Ireland by the members of the ISlectrical Trades Union are said to be against a strike, in a large majorityJohn Rill wrote in the July issue of-the BoilermakersJournal the following somewhat significant sentence:- I&quot;I regret the time is again too short to thoroughly consult our members before we oast your votes at this Congress, but I hope we shall take Some means of ascertaining your opinions and voting in accordance therewith.11There/
.-6- 363There is in this case, as in previous ballots, the . risk, almost the certainty, that votes Will De &quot;manipulated. A former trades unionist openly states that&apos;when he was a . delegate in charge of ballot bosses, he always tbbi&apos;&apos;&quot;o&apos;are to have a large pocket, into which he slipped&apos;bundles of votes......  -x ............w..... ,   y..x m*$S .1&apos;** AjV&apos; B i&apos;-     *-&quot;.... , which were contrary to his own inclinations.   A case of at): * &apos;:,,, rather different nature ie still puzzling a group vof,kofficials in Lancashire.   During the ballot on the iaBt&apos;miners&apos; award,the number of votes recorded in one pit exceeded? by hundreds u   the number of men on the pay sheets.   The probable &apos;,.e;^lanation is that a group of extremists made&quot;! tour oi&apos; the ,,. polling, stations, instead of voting 6nly%advance^ &apos; &apos;  -;. lilt,   i*0 &apos;   *. T. * *tf&apos;&quot;- 4*       -     IIn quarters hostile to the&apos;Congress&quot;&apos;voie, questtons* . are being raised as to the legality of the vot^ ahd&apos;It is ^contended that as the strike would be entered upon for political objects, it would be illegal&quot;&quot;to^^peW^adi Union Jf^nds in connection therewith.   Under the Trade Uiildn Act of, 1913, money for a political purpose Is * ept distinct fromthe general funds.There has been surprisingly little&apos; comment in the Labour Press on the Congress decision     Tiie iaootr tews Service of July 17th ignores it.   This may be due, of course,to the fact that most of the oarers &quot;went&apos; to Press 5to&quot;6 early*&quot; &amp;  .* &apos;;   &quot;- &apos;r--&apos;&apos;   - .** Jt** *--n*7, &quot;.&quot; .....to deal with the roatter, or the papers may oe waiting for e lead.Tncre is no doubt that the present intention of Jlr, Sqillie is to bring the miners out if&quot;&apos;their wages&apos;demands are.not conceded.   The most significant&quot;move&quot;during the week is that members of the miners&apos; &apos;axecuti-ve&quot; are wrlt;inf privately to members of the Transport Workerr axecUtive and eating them to arrange that in the event of a miners&apos; strike a &apos;* &quot;S*      (At 3&quot; Mtft   *.;,r&quot;bhly/
m  6  *tonly cool needed by hospitals shall be handled.   The effect of thie would be that stocks of Industrial ooal would be useless, unless stored at the works whioh need them.Apart from Yorkshire, where it is openly stated that Mr. Herbert Smith is a very (rood friend of the coalowners, there seems little doubt that a majority of miners would strike for higher wages.   The same support for a strike on behalf of Ireland is unlikely, for already Canr;ool: Chase, Forest of Sean, North Yorkshire and South Durham delegates have sent to headquarters protests against such a strike.  South Wales seems, at present, to be favourable to direct action and Lanarkshire is doubtful, owing to the apathy of the sound element.Considerable importance attaches to the fact that a form of working agreement has been reached between the Miners1 Feden tion of Groat  britain and the Amalgamated Engineering Union.   The agreement when finally drawn up will apply to all the coalfields of Great Britain.   Tho principle agreed to ie that where members of either organisation arc engaged in an industry, the organisation catering for the industry as suofe will control all workers in it.  A sub-committee of five of eaoh of the two unions was appointed to formulate a detailed sehemo that will be submitted to. the ; ecutives at a further Joint meeting.   The effect of this arrangement will be that in the event of a miners&apos; strike the llinora1 Federation of Great Britain will have power to call out the engine and pump men.The leaders&apos; opposition to the Miners&apos; Bill is finding muoh support among the rank and file.The general publio, especially the lower middle class, seem to think that the Government should take a firmer attitude against the big Trade Unions,  They think that a oriels is at hand and eay that it &quot;must be fought with every ounce of power the Government possess/&apos;On/
- - On July 17th the Northumberland Miners held their annualgala, and&apos;were addressed by Smillie and Hodges, who are now termed &quot;the Mosob and Aaron of the mining world&quot;, Ramsay laoDonald and John Cairns. lO,   Smillie&apos;s reference to American and German minors caused interruptions which proved that hie popularity in the district is not bole proof.   Hodges indicated, as did Smillie, that a crisis is imminent, saying, &quot;Be prepared in your organisation, be prepared in relation to your commissariat, your co-operative movements, be prepared financially, be prepared for anything that may happen in the future,   I feel sure by my study of the forces that&apos; are at &quot; worlt, that wo are in for the gravest: period in our historyPhilip Snowden, Srnect Bevln and Lansbury were the chief speakers at the Durham Miners&apos; Cala on July 17thMany of the Miners&apos; leaders will attend the International Mining Conference at Geneva on July 29th.THE ENGINEERING FOUNDRY, AflD SHIPBUILDING INDUSTRIESThere is a probability of looal aud a oossibility of general trouble over the recent decision of the Industrial Court,   Over 8,000 boilermakers at middlesbrongii, Stockton and Darlington struck on July 21st in consequence of the refusal of their demand for an increase in wages.In Oldham, where 10,000 members of the Amalgamated Engineering Union aro afieoted, the men hive already dieoon-tinued over-tine work as a protoat against the Industrial Court decision and this ha3 caused a lot of trouble in the factories, many of the workers havin:: to stand off owing to the fact that the factories&apos; mechanics will not dc repairs at night time or week ends.In Coventry, on the other hand, the men are somewhat steadier than might have been erpected and my correspondentreports/
reports that consternation prevails in regard to the numerous discharges which are taking place.   The. men think that if a strike is forced now, the Union will lose, owing to the    ) slump in trade.It is unfortunate that Hr. Brownlie is ill, as strong leadership is. especially important at the moment; the unofficial eloment is gaining strength, as was proved by the gasworkors&apos; strike, and the Communists,&apos; who are drawn principally from tho ranks of the engineers, have inaugurated a campaign to undermine the authority of the Trades Union Officials.   They are also working to exploit unofficial strikes or, in their, own words, &quot;to bo on the spot whenever spontaneous revolts occur, doing vital propaganda and endeavouring to oommunistically educate discontent.&quot;THE TB2TIL:i) V?(EOHSIvly Yorkshire correspond put. reports, that feeling is running [ high amon.5 the woollen textile workers and that the application for a AO/ increase has resulted in a dsadlick, as tho employers ! seem determined to make no advance on their offer, which has been rejected by ballot, in many, places.   The employers appear to bo in a position in which it would suit them to close down. Stocks are large and a slump is expected.   The time limit expires on July 31st and Hr. Ben l\irner indicates that there, may be a, stoppage.At the annual Conference of the United Textile Factory Workers1 Association to bo held at-Blackpool on the.26th and 27th July, a proposal is to be submitted by the Legislative Council. of tec. ahwve.

Hy Glasgow correspondent thinks that the stoppage will be general in hie area, as even the more moderate working men and women are opposed to the Act.   The Iron and Steel Trades Confederation end the Lanarkshire Miners County Union have pledged their support.   The agitatlbn is being engineered chiefly by Bailie Wheatley and David Kirkwood.   The former has written a pamphlet entitled &quot;The Hew Kent Act - a roply to the rent raisers&quot; which is being widely distributed in the Glasgow area.RUSSIA&apos;S INEBRSST D BfllTISB LA30UH UKR33TA wireless mo s Sage -despatched from Ho scow during thismonth Is a &quot;good Sample of the efforts of tbs bolshevikGovernment to promote and-exploit unrest in this country.It is sent by the Central Committee of the All Russian Unionof Workers and Employees in Public Communications end addressedto the Haroent operators.&quot;Owing to %ite guard bayonets, we cannot be actually with you in these days of your struggle,   fight and remember that the beet expression of solidarity by Russian proletarians with the fighting workers of the world consists of the victories of our brave Red armies ...

The &quot;Daily Herald&quot; of July 16th reports that the Bxecutil Committee of the Third International has sent a reply to theII; Indopendont Labour Party questionnaire of May 25th. Tho Committoo states that it is not the business of the Internet^ &quot;to indicate the exact form in whioh the revolution is to dovolop&quot; but adds that the British workers must prepare, not f an easy parliamentary victory, but for victory by civil war. &quot;If the workers should gain power without this civil war, that1 would only mean that the necessity for civil war would $onfro: them when they set out to free themselves from capitalist exploitation and speculation.MIn regard to the affiliation of revolutionary British parties to the Labour Party, the Committee expresses approval, as long as freedom of propaganda is retained.   The Committee recommends this course to &quot;free the masses from the opportunistic leaders of the Labour Party&apos;1.In connection with the recent visit of Mr. Wellhead and Mr. Clifford Allen, &quot;The International&quot; (the organ of the Left: Wing of the Independent Labour Party) alleges that they &quot;were not elected to go to Russia by the National Administrative Council&quot;, that &quot;the money for their expenseshas come from a private source&quot; and that &quot;the questionnaire was not drawn up by the national Administrative Council&quot;.TEg SBOOIIP IKTDBHATIOflALThe forthcoming mooting of the Second International at Geneva will be attended by British delegates representing the Trades Union Congress, the Labour Party and the Fabian Society Amongst them are llesars.

The organisers arc somewhat doubtful as to tho wisdom of holding the meeting, as they, fear a counter-demonstration by tho London public, on account of the murder of Colonel Smyth.   Art 0&apos;Brien and other Sinn Pein leaders are very much against street disturbances.Sinn Fein meetings have been reported during the week at Birmingham, Oateshead, Coventry.   At the first named, Cathal Cf Shannon sooke arid a banner with the inscription ^10^,000 men died fighting for tho rights of small nations; Irishmen demand that the promise bo fulfilled&apos;1...was displayed.   Thero was no Trade Union support.   The meeting, which was preceded by a procession, plodded its fullest support to the Trade Union Congress resolution.   Between two and three hundred people were present.On July 10th thero was disturbance at a Sinn Fein meeting in Manchester.   The audience numbered about 1,0^0 and 3inn 3/einers assaulted some, interrupters at an early stcge of the mooting.   A free fight ensued between tho English and Irish and the police wore forced to make a baton charge.   One man was arrested, but attempts to free him were frustrated by Sinn Fein leaders, who brought their mentors to the assistance of the police.It is reported that in Huddersfield, where there is a considerable number of Irish work people, a species of intimidation is in progress similar to that practised in Ireland.   The victims are two loyal Irish policemen whose parents, now resident in Huddersfield, are suspected of having given information to the Royal Irish Constabulary, when they were in Dublin.   The younger man has been seriously assaulted
IRBliAPDTho condition of the country is becoming steadily worse. Tho number of indictable offences reported during the week totalled 879; 285 ware directly attributable to Sinn Fein and 26 to agrarian motives.   There&apos;were 19 cases of malicious destruction of RoyU. Irish Constabulary barracks (vacated) and courthouses by fire end explosives.   On nine occasions the mails were held up and official correspondence stolen.   Sight members of tho Royal Irish Constabulary were murdered in the provinces during the week, eight wore wounded and eleven policl patrols wera iirod on but oso&amp;ped without casualty.

There is as yet no traoe of Ooworal Lucas.&quot;Old Ireland&quot;, &quot;Young Ireland&quot;, end tho &quot;Watchword of Labour&quot; appeared as usual during tho week.  Ho doubt these papers are active in spreading Sinn Fein propaganda, but their harmful influence is small compared with that of the &apos;Irish Independent&quot; and the &quot;Freeman1s Journal&quot;.   The latter may be accounted directly responsible for the murders of Ur, Allan Bell and Colonel Smyth, Divisional Commissioner in Cork.There are few strikes at present; employers yield at onoe to the demands of the Transport Union backed by Sinn Fein.The extreme leaders have had a discussion on the general situation and the;&apos; have deoided that the present form of guerilla warfare against the police and troops is to be Intensified.   They believe that their propaganda has poisoned English labour against the Government.It is stated that orders arc to be issued to the Irish Volunteers to commence baiting the troche end trying to exasperate then in every ray so that they nay males reprisals. The idea is that in the event of r eprisals by the troops useful propaganda would bo obtained for uce in English In hour circles.C. T. Cram^ and J. R.
