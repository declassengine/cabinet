The effect.of the resolution is to refer the question to the Trade Unions, but the importance of the vote must not be ignored.   There is a growing feeling among workmen that the Government has failed to solve the Irish question, and that it must leave it to others.   It is intended to send a deputation to the Prime Minister, making definite proposals for a settlement.It is believed that a majority of the miners will support their leaders if called upon to strike.   The Yorkshire miners are not enthusiastic and the finances, even in South Wales, would not warrant the payment of strike pay for more than a fow days.Details are given of the scheme for a &quot;General Staff&quot; for Labour.   If this comes into being it may become an important factor in the internal affairs of this country.The &quot;Communist Parties&quot; are still quarrelling; several extremists are endeavouring to sew to Russia.   The position is very unsatisfactory at this moment, for tho Soviet Gevernment refuses to admit any but extremists and claims the right to send&apos; anyono to England.The welcome to tho Labour Delegation at th$ Albert Rail did not altogether please the esxreiaiste.   Dr. Haden Guest spoke with great courage.There are indications that tne Sinn Fein Party in Ireland would like to come to a compromise on the basis of Dominion Self-Government and a united Ireland.   Their frame of mind in this reBpoot is being carefully watched.
3?BB TRADE UNION congress the Congress that mot on July 13th did not enhance its reputation when it passed two resolutions, conflicting in*spirit if not in letter.   The EailwayinenVa resolution,.which advocated &quot;a truce between all parties by the Irish People themselves using their influence to stop all murdor and outrage and by the Government withdrawing the Army of , Occupation&quot;, was carried by 1,952,000 to 1,759,000 votes, but this was followed by a second resolution demanding &quot;the withdrawal of all British troops and the cessation of the production of munitions of war destined to. be used against Ireland and Russia&quot;, and recommending a general strike if the Government refused these demands,   This was carried by 2,760,OdOto 1,636,COO votes.   It is to he remembered, however/ that the effect of the second resolution was to refer the matter to a ballot of the Trade Unions, which is a very different thing from a threat of immediate action; that the card vote of 2,760,000 for direct action was little more than half the possible total of 5,283,000, and that 1,700,000 of the vote represents the voting: strength of the miners, engineers and transport workers.   The leaders of ttese three groups, Sraillie, Mfvnn and Williams know very well that a, majority of the Unions and the Parliamentary Committee are divided on the question.On the other hand, it is known that Smillie and Williams are arranging to force a strike for the &quot;Hands off.Russian *&amp;nd &quot;Ireland&quot; movements in August, and it is , quite pos sib la that Williams has given Lenin some pledge in this respect.   Lenin&quot;s publie adulation of Smillie is probably not without significance.   Smillie1s great nationalisation scheme failed and he is a fanatical and disappointed man - the kind of man who would now U3e any excuse for forcing a crisis.As to the rank and file, there is no doubt that if the
strike were merely a prolonged week-end, many thousands would comply, but it&apos; is doubtful whether a prolonged strike to force the huids of the Government would be supported.Some of the Labour leaders appear to take a very grave view of the situation.   They admit that the majority of the workers is not in favour of Sinn Fein or of .an Irish Republic. They are in favour of dominion Self-Government, but thoy are now labouring under a sense of great irritation with the Government for what they regard as its partiality.   They harp on the difference in the treatment of Sir Edward Carson and the Lord Chancellor as compared with the Sinn Seiners, mid they think that the. present state of.irritation is an opportunities  which will hot be missed by the Revolutionary Party.   According to one of them; the present crisis may woll end. in Civil V/ar. He says that Labour intends.to go in deputation to the Prime &apos; Minister to suggest a settlement with the Sinn Fein leaders oni the i?asis that while they guarantee no further outrages, the Government will Withdraw the Array.   If the Sinn Feiners break &apos;   &quot;their guarantee English Labour would be behind the Government in any strong action it might: take.   There appears to be a general  feeling that there is&apos; no coherent policy either in the&quot; treatment of-Ireland or the treatment of Russia.TRS COAL HIKERSThe indications are that the rank and file of the miners are behind their leaders in the new demand.   In Yorkshire! 00 far, there is not much, enthusiasm, but if the leaders really intend to call the.men.out they,will,come.   It is important, however, to remember that even among the South Wales miners,I the richest of the groups, the. total funds, some, of whiof^&amp;r tied up in investments., are under  415,000 and the. membershi, is 210,000.   In other words, the strike pay per man works ou
w 3 &quot;*to only 39s, 6d.   Mr. Smillie1 s speeoh at Tamwoirth on July 11th was instructive.   He described this Government as &quot;the most wicked in:the history of this country&quot;, and that its end might come sooner than was generally expected.   It has for some time been apparent that the powerful Unions believe that they can stampede the Cabinet, but if they knew, that their demands would be debated in the House of Commons they would have less self-confidence.   They would always rather -doal with the Government than with the employers, and it has&quot; been suggested that the decontrol of coal, except in so far as the limitation of export is ooncerned, would greatly strengthen the position of the owners.   In the meantime, every effort ought to be made to increase the stocks of industrial coal, for it is unlikely that the miners can strike before the end of August.TBB &quot;BANDS COT BUSSIA&quot; M0V3I4BNT .The Albert Hall was filled on July 11th for the welcome to the British Labour Delegation, which has been fully reported in the Press.   Mrs. Snowden did not spoak, but Dr. Haden-Guest said a good deal which was not approved of by; the extremists at the meeting.   The other delegates, made the1usual violent speeches and a resolution, oailing for Peace in Soviet Russia, was passed.A subsidiary resolution, warning the Spa Conference against giving Military assistance to Poland, was carried by the Trades Union Congress.A &quot;GBBBRAl STAFF&quot; FOR LABOUR   :The &quot;Labour Hews Service&quot; for July 3rd contained details of a scheme for a &quot;General Staff&quot;,   The industrial organisation is to be represented by a General Council composed of thirtymembers/

action, to organise Unions-and to-enter Into, relations        1 u with Labour movements abroad.   In order to most the expenditure it Is proposed to levy one penny a member, producing an income of about  26,000 a year.     :,TO BIVAL 00MMfl.IST PABTIBBMiss Sylvia Pankhursfe Communist Party is already in financial difficulties,   it a special meeting pi the Finance Committee it transpired that even if the whole staff received notice their wages would absorb all the available income.   The Party is now urging all Communists to devote Saturday afternoon to propaganda and to give.their Saturday afternoon&apos;s wages to the Party funds.   It is enoounterins a good deal of opposition in different parts ox London.The followers of HcI4anus and Inkpin are working with equal energy to make a success of their Communist Party, which has been derisively, termed the &quot;rank and vile convention&quot;. MoManue^ Party is certainly of more importance than that of Sylvia Panfchurat.   It is at present exercised about thai question of affiliation to the Labour Party.The following wireleas message was sent en c^air by Lenin on July 10th: - vrt^mMTo the Joint provisional Committee for the Communist Party of Britain.MOSCOWJuly 10.&quot;Having reoeived the; letter of the Joint Provisional Committee for the Communist Party of Britain, dated June 20, I hasten to^ answer, in response to their request, that I entirely sympathise with the plan they have developed for the immediate organisation of one sole Communist Party in England.   I consider thst the tactics of Comrade Sylvia * Pankburst and of the WorkersV Sooialist Federation are wrong, because they refuse to join in the unification of the British Socialist Party, the Socialist Labour Party and others into one Comwuniet Party.   In particular I am personally in favour of participation in Parliament and in favour of adhesion to the Labour Party under the condition of reserving entire freedom and independent Communist action; and I will defend these tactics at the SecondCongress/
Congross of tho Third International on July 15th in Moscow,   I consider as most desirable the rapid organisation of one Communist Party on the basis of all the decisions of the Third International and also the bringing of that party into closest touoh with the industrial workers of the world and Shop Stewards&apos; Committees in order to unite completely with them in the nearest future.&quot;THE HOUSING ftUBSTIOHAgitation about the housing difficulties is now coneen-trated on the question of increased: rents, and there is a talk of a T&apos;No &quot;ReW strike.   The movement has not been successful in London, though the National Union of e2:-Servioe Hen has urged all workers to stop paying rent on and after a date to be proclaimed on August 27th.   The Rent strike is to continue until the cost of living has fallen to 100 per cant above pre-var level. -&apos;&apos;It is interesting to note that many of the strikers at tho London Docks are now at work with the Building Trades Guild on property near Denmark Hill..   One of these men, who holds the champ ion ship for: the number of bricks he can lay, had a quarrel with a for email who had pulled him up and ordered him to go slower.   He-says&apos; that&apos;the work on new buildings is worse than at the Docks, where he was allowed to carry on at hie own speed.   Some of his fellow workmen are demanding his discharj on the ground that he works too fast.   He openly criticises the slack methods of the Guild and the lack of proper supervision, quoting an instance where the men had knocked off for rain and were playing Crown and Anchor in the. mess-room with the foreman for two hours alter the rain had ceased.   AtJfiVe minutes to twelve t ie foreman su^es tad tht.t the men should go baok to work for five minutes and claim for.t::o whole morning.   It Is interesting to note that this bricklayer has now fallen in wit^ the ways of the other^Kin ;and,as he-describes it, does not do - ,-.-.&apos;     &apos;. enough/
- .1.t. ! &apos; m    &apos;f   menough even to dirty his handa.J. Murrey, the organiser of the strike at the Docks, is a prominent member of the Building Guild.   It is said that 12,000 operatives were willing to take shares in the Guild.BRISTOL B2C^a8RVIOB,MBaThe plans for a maroh to London have been considerably modified and only twenty-one men, headed by Oilmore, left Bristol on July 14th,   They intend to go first to Bath and are taking a barrel organ.   Their action in London is dependent upon the recruits gained in the course of the maroh.   The total membership of the Bristol branch of the International Union of Ex-Service Men is 306 end these men are socialists who are unpopular with the Bristol Trade Unions.COKVICTIOfl :Willi&amp;m Barry, who was carrying arms from -America to Ireland and letters showing the nature of the quarrel    , between the two Irish Revolutionary Parties in the United States, is sentenced to two months&apos; imprisonment in the second division.  Re pleaded guilty, &apos;TRI2 &quot;BAILI HERALD&quot;Prom a trustworthy souroe in Berlin it is stated that Litvinoff has sent a telegram to Tohiteherine to the effeot thct the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; is passing through a new oriels and . will turn 1 Right&apos; Trade Union unless the Soviet Government supports it.   It hopes to be on firm ground if it can receive 50,000 frojaos for the next six months.   It acts practically as the Soviet organ and has gone even further to the  eft since Lan8hur(vfs visit to Russiai   In Litvinoff&apos;s opinion it ie doing important service to the Soviet Government, andhe/
he recommendr thak assistance he ^id. lit instalments Ifrora the Soviet Foreign Office fund.   He adds that the &quot;Herald&quot; has lately obtained 6,000 francs from Russia, but has received no paper from Stockholm.It is believed that Krassin will be asked to bring the funds. The negotiations were carried on by Francis Meynell during his recent visit to Litvinoff at Copenhagen.TOM BARKERTom Barker, a member of tho Industrial Workers of the World, who was deported from Australia to Chile in 1918 and is now addressing meetings in support of the twelve imprisoned Australians, is making very violent speeches against Mr. Hughes.   His colonial speech appears to appeal to his audience and he Bells a good deal of his literature.   He boasted recently that through the American seamen Union, which he organised, ho could smuggle anyone out of the country.B^LIEUTBTOT GgOkOg 2ICHOLSQBThis man, vho is now in the employment of the League of Rations Union, frequents the International Socialist Club. Some members of the club state that he is carrying on traffio in small arms.  He asked Esther Archer, the cigarette maker who was recently arrested, to write her experiences in prison, which he would have published in an evening paper.   She refused.SIflirPEIH IN GREAT britain during the week the usual Sinn Fein meetings htve been held in London and in tho provinces, but nothing of special imports^ has transpired.   Collections on behal:C of the Irish railwaymen are still being made in many districts.; Iff Si, 11 &quot; in/
.*   0  wIn June Seem CICelly, who has boon appointed organiser for the Irish Self-Determination League in the Manchester and Liverpool district, formed two new branches, with a membership of about 40 each.      Councillor P. J. Kelly has not attended any public meetings during the month.   Many of the local Irish are unemployed as a result of the Dock Strike and he is consequently unpopular with them.On July 3rd, it was stated at a &quot;private&quot; meeting of Sinn Fein officials and commandants of the Irish Volunteer Army held in the Gaelic League Hall, Glasgow, that  3,000 had been subscribed in Olcsgow and surrounding districts for the, Irish Republican Loan;  2,000 of this amount had been sent to Ireland and  500 had been expended in purchasing arms and ammunition for the Volunteers in Scotland.   There were about .*;300 on hand amongst the several Irish Volunteer Commandants and Sinn Fein officials for the use of those going to Ireland during the Glasgow Fair holidays.   It was stated that about 500 service rifles of various patterns were in the hands.or under tho control of the several Volunteer Commandants.   They are well supplied with ammunition.It wan also said that the Sinn Fein organisation in Scotland has increased in numbers in the Glasgow and Western districts during the past three months by 7 Of.Sinn Feinors have been greatly interested in the proceedings of the Leamington Conference and the Trades Union Congress and seem hopeful of some result.Tho Coyne celebrations in this oountry appear to have passed off without friction.   It is estimated that between SO,CCD and 30,000 Ulstorm*ifl demonstrated in Glasgow and one resolution expressed &quot;devotion to the Crown and Royal Eov.se&quot;. A number of fights occurred in the evening, but were the usual Saturday night brawls.IRELAND/
IRELAND &quot;......It anything the general tone of the coxintry has been worse during the week, and tho campaign of boycotting directed against the police and the general hostility to the administration of th lav/ were more acute.   In all 224 indictable offences were report wide areas of the country are now without police and entirely controlled by Sinn Fein.   Of these outrages 167 were directly attributable to Sinn ?ein, 28 wore due to agrarian motives, while 31 wore serious offences due largely to the state of lawlessness in, which the country has fallen,   The? holding up and robbery of mails has become a daily occurrence and it is now impossible to send any official documents of importance through tho post.Republican courts held secret sittings in nany places and even loyalists are compelled to submit to their decrees to avoi injury.   Scarcely any Grand Jurors attended tfaterford Assizes, in consequence of threatening notices signed &quot;Irish Republican Army&quot; which forbade them to do so.   Petty Sessions Courts in the ^ost and South are almost completely boycotted.Thore are signs that the leaders of Sinn Pein would be Glasgow to come to terms with the Government oven on the basis of Lominion Home Rule, provided that the proposal to exclude Ulster were dropped.   After the resolution passed by the Trade Union Congress the violent section will probably redouble its activities, but it is clear that the persons associated with Griffith have misgivings as to the wisdom of continuing the campaign of outrage.A loading article in &quot;Old Ireland&quot; states that &quot;the refnea of the two great presidential parties in the United States to recognise the Irish Republic is a disagreeable inoideht ... the campaign of our President in the United States has&apos;not failed It will yet bear fruit a hundred fold.   But tho immediateobject/
m   XI  **object has not been secured.&quot;   The tone of this and other Sinn Fein papers is seditious but is no worse than the Independent&quot; and &quot;Freeman1 s Journal&quot;.There is no change in the situation regarding the strike&apos; against handling munitions.   Traffic in some parts of the West is at a standstill.   At this time of the year largo numbers of labourers travel from Mayo to the english and Scottish harvests.   These poodle have been held up owing to tho stoppage of traffic.   As a matter of policy Sinn Fein ic running a service of motors for the conveyance of these labourers.Meetings of disaffected persons hove taken place to discuss the action of tho Volunteers should the Government decide to run trains.   In several cases it was decided that directly troops were used to drive trains the Irish Volunteers should commence organised destruction.
