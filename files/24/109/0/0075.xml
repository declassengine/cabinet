THIS DOC WENT. IS THE, PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTYCABIN E..T ,IRISH   SITUATION   COMMITTEE .SECRET,\V*****  *u. 4( *Ji&quot;r**-C,P,1672.Note by Mr(Long,The Irish Situation Committee held its Fourth Meeting in the House of Commons to-day.   All the members were present and in addition the Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland attended.The Committee felt strongly that the moment has arrived for the Government actively to assume the offensive in its Irish policy, and to come to grips with Sinn Fein.   They considered that the Government should show the world at large that it is in deliberate earnest in its assertion that the republican movement in Ireland should be destroyed and that the authority of the Imperial Government cannot be flouted with impunity.   The means for carrying out this policy were deliberated at length by the Committee and the advantages and disadvantages which would follow the introduction of martial law were discussed.   Some members of the Committee were of opinion that&apos;a list should be made of the powers with vrhieh it was desired to invest the Government of Ireland in order to enable it to carry out an offensive policy against Sinn Fein and that if the powers desired were unobtainable except under martial law then martial law must be introduced.   The Committee generally, however, was in favour of the immediate introduction of martial la&quot;: and not the least consideration which influenced them in arriving at this conclusion was the moral support which it would give to the military in the carrying out of their duties.The Committee in considering some of the methods to be used in giving effect to this offensive policy &quot;ere of Opinionthat (a) the running of the railways except for Governmentpurposes

The precise duties of the military and police are obscure and in some cases the police are considered to be under the military and in others the military under the police.   The Committeo are strongly of tho opinion that the duties and responsibilities of the officers who administer -theso two bodies should bo so  &quot;defined as to admit of no confusion.(Initialled)    W.H.L.
