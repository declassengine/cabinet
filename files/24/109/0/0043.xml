This document is the property of His Britannic Majestys Government.SECRET.THE CABINET.DISPOSAL OF EX-RUSSIAN STOCKS OP ARMS IN TURKISHDEPOTS.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.I circulate herewith a telegram from the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief,    0149 Constantinople, and request a decision on the question of principle which is raised as to    9541 whether General Wrangel is entitled to ex-Russian stocks of arms now in Turkish dep6ts under the custody of the Allies.The Cabinet, on 11th June (Conclusion (1)) considered that, in view of the assumption of the offensive by General Wrangel, His Majesty&apos;s Government were released from all responsibilities in regard to all forces under his command ; the arms in question, however, are not British but are presumably still the property of the Russians, and there appears to be no reason why they should not remove them at their own expense if they wish to do so until an armistice is agreed upon. In this connection, I invite the attention of my colleagues to the considerations put forward in mv Memorandum of 26th June (CP, 1540).- W. S. C.The Wae Office,mh July, 1920.   . -From the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Constantinople, to the War Office.Handed in 1st July, 1920, 1800. (No. I. 8906.) ,  (Received 2nd, 0930.)I have since arrival at Constantinople adhered to principle of allowing Allies to remove from Turkish arsenals and dep6ts in my (?) charge all armament other than captured from each Ally. No Ally has been allowed to remove Turkish armament for their own use, nor has any been taken for British, and I have regarded (one group undecipherable) custody as being on behalf of all Allies. Thus the Volunteer Army had no Turkish stocks, but had been allowed to draw on stocks of captured Russian armament. Please instruct me whether such ex-Russian stocks as are still in Turkish dep6ts may be continued to be issued to General Wrangel.
