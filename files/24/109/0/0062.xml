I 1-*? GfTKIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOVMNMENTj-,%)    -SECRET, 0 A B I HE T.CP. 1659e a memo: by the Chairman of the Home Affairs Committee, covering a Draft Bill, &apos;(Reference H.Ar.C 69th fifeeting, Min.3, and 70th Meeting, Min. 3)*A decision of the Cabinet is wanted upon the question as to vrtiether it is desirable or practicable to pass Legislation before the Recess for the purpose of arming the Government with exception-al powers in the event of a grave National emergency such as was occasioned by the Railway Strike last Autumn..    Should the answer to this question be In the affirmative, the Home Affairs Committee has prepared a Bill to give effect to the purpose of the Government, a copy of which is annexed.The arguments in favour of Legislation are, briefly, that . unless the powers provided for in the Bill are taken the Government would bo unable effectively to cope with a well organised Strike .  upon a large scale *     The powers under the Defence of the. Realm Act may expire before Parliament meets again in the Autumn and in any case they do not invest the Executive Authority with the power of using the armed forces of the Crown to supply the labour withdrawn by the Trades Unions,   The Home Secretary, the Minister of Transport and the Minister of Pood urged at the Home Affairs Committee that the Government should introduce and pass a Bill.On the other hand, the introduction of a Measure of this sort -would certainly raise isSgcHycontentious questions and might precipitate-tate the crisis which It Is desired to avoid..   The year is far ad-advanced and the introduction of so important a Measure at a very late t    stage in a laborious Session would certainly be unpopular with the House and might add to the difficulties of the Government in the country.    Moreover, there is some force in the contention that the Government will, even as things stand, be equipped with powers ade-quate to deal with any situation which is likely to arise during the Recess.   The Ministry of Pood&apos;s Continuance Bill, which will shortly be/
-    3GBdq passed, gives to the Government&apos;many important powers in connection with food. .  The Defence of the Realm Regulations may carry us over until Peace and the exohange of ratifica-tions with Turkey is not, I imagine, likely to tako place before the Autumn.    On the other hand, the continued exercise of emergency powers for purposes not connected with the war merely in virtue of the Defence of the Realm Act is, in the opinion of the Solicitor-General expressed at the meeting of the Home Affairs Committee, of doubtful legality.    Naval ratings were used as volunteers during the Railway Strike, but undor present conditions the Admiralty will on no account allow naval ratings to be used as volunteers on a future occasion..      In the event of the cabinet deciding for the intro-duction of the Bill, it would be desirable for the Minister in Charge to make it clear that the Territorial Force- would not be called upon under any circumstances to render compulsory service in strike breaking.    Any such liability would,&quot; it was represented, at once stop recruitment for the Territorial Army.(signed) H. A* I. FISHER.81at July, 1920.
