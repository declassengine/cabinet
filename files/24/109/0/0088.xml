I bow append copies of the resolutions and communications I am receiving,I have giBton very much thought to this problem both before and since the issue of my first Memo. O.P*1643.   I have most seriously considered whether we could equitably leave the single men out of a further Extension.   Themore I examine it the more^1 am compelled to abandon the idea.   Theso single men are practically all unskilled; and nearly two thirds of them are congregated in the 10 or IB &quot;big centres of population. Some probably have not made very much effort to get wor&amp;u (This is clear from the number of cases in which Donation is suspended or withdrawn &quot;by Local Employment Committees.)    But undoubtedly many have, and failed/   The unskilled^ market in their areas is full.   We cannot refer those men to tho ^oor Law.must continue the Donation, as proposed, and in the meantime devote ourselves tnce more to the problem of their training and ro-abscrption.(Initd.)    T, J.
