(THIS DOOtJMENT IS TH&quot;? PROPERTY OF HIS BRITAWO MAJBSTT^SCP. 1662.SECRET.MARTIAL LAW IN IRELAND *CABINET.Copy of letter from the Judge Advocate General to the Chief Secretary for Ireland.Judge Advocate General 3 Office, 68. Victoria Street^ SrF.19th July, 1920.My dear Greenwood,1.     In accordance with your request on Saturday I have considered the advantages and disadvantages from a legal point of view of proclaiming Martial Law in Ireland.   What I understand you desire to have from me is a precise statement as to the modes in which the effective and practical powers of the Executive In suppressing disorders would he strengthened or weakened by such a Proclamation.2*     It Is necessary at the outset to make it clear that the legal right to enforce Martial Law does not depend upon Proclamation but upon circumstances which render it necessary.&apos;    The circumstances which justify it are the existence of rebellion which cannot be dealt with under the ordinary law.    The fact that some Civil Courts are still sitting or allowed by the military Commander to continue to sit is not a conclusive criterion, see Ex pnrte Marais 1902, Appeal Cases 109.    So long, however, as Civil Courts are actually sitting the question whether the circumstances justify Martial Law can be raised in them as was done in Ireland in 1798 in Wolfe ?after%. case 27 How. State Trials page 613.    The object and necessity for the Proclamation is to give notice and Earning to all concerned that the Government regards Ireland as being in a state of rebellion and intends to enforce Martial Law to suppress it.    In my opinion the circumstances existing in Ireland at the present time are such as legally to justify the proclamation and enforcement of&quot;martial law, but upon this you should also have the opinion of the Irish Law Officers who are more familiar with Irish conditions than I am.    My knowledge of Ireland is derived only from what I read in the Press and from reviewing Irish Courts-Martial.
Marfcial-Xaw-ls in subetanoo andLJnufaot the super-session of law-fairing, rebellion by force^    Anything may be done under Martial Law which is reasonably necessary to suppress the rebellion and subject to this the only limitations on the power of the executive are those imposed by the dictates of conscience and humanity and the customs and usages of war, so far as applicable and customarily applied to rebellion.aIt has to be remembered that /form of  Statutory Martial Law already exists in Ireland under the Defence of the Realm Acts and Regulations made pursuant thereto, which although originally passed with a wholly different pur-pose in view, are in fact being used in Ireland for the suppression of rebellion.    But the proclamation and enforcement of martial law would give to the Executive the following additional powers over and above those&quot;which it possesses by virtue of the Defence of the Realm Acts and Regulations:-(a) Military Courts for the trial of persons not subject to military law could under Martial Law inflict sentences of death.   Courts-Martial under the Defence of the Realm Regulations can only award death if the offence was committed with intent to assist the enemy which in those regulations means the enemy in the Great War (see the,proviso to Section 1(4) of the Defence of the Realm Act 1914).      Most of the graver trimes now being committed in.Ireland are of such a character that under martial law the death penalty could properly be inflicted by military courts.   This applies to,such offences as usurping tho functions of the King18 Govern-ment, joining, aiding or  abetting or assisting&apos; rebels and serious crimes of violence.   The death penalty would probably be a far more effective punishment than sentence of penal servitude and inprisonment under existing conditions.(b) Persons not subject to military law couldbe tried before Military Courts not only for offences against the Defence of the Realm Regulations but for all offences of dis-order and violence connected with the rebellion, e.g. for treason or murder.-2-
(c) The trial for of fences age-^st the Defence of the Realm Regulations are at pxosent by General and District Courts^-Martial,    Field General Courts-Martial which are far less formal and more summary&apos;  are authorised by Defence of the Realm Regulation &apos; 58A;   but it is not made clear who can convene them unless the troops are on active service.    Under Martial Law Regulations Military Courts could be established analogous to Field General Courts-Martial,    Although it would be necessary before such Courts to give reasonable opportunities for making a defence and although it would still be necessary to insist that the offence charged should be proved by sufficient legal evidence it would be possible to dispense with all formalities and technicalities and to proceed in a very summary manner,(d) Guards sentries ajfrd military officers and soldiers and those responsible for maintaining law and order would have a greater sense of confidence in using lethal weapons to prevent anticipated attacks, the commission of grave offences, escapes or evasions of arrest,(e) The Military Commander would have greater powers of issuing and varying any orders he might think necessary for the maintenance of order without reference to the powers conferred by the Defence of the Realm-Acts and Regulations.(f) The troops in Ireland could after the proclamation%mation of Martial Law be declared to be on active service and it would be possible to enforce more rigorous discipline, and &quot;to inflict more severe punishments for derelictions of duty by Officers or soldiers.   Apart from such a proclamation it is not quite clear that the troops in Ireland are on active service within the meaning of Section 189 of the Army Act though in ray opinion they are.Turning next to the disadvantages-of proclaiming Martial Law from the point of view from which alone I am consider-ing the matter, that is to say the legal powers of the Executive to cope with disorder, there would be no disadvantages.   The Executive would still have every power which they have at present, and it would not be necessary for them to use the additional powers which they would possess to any further or greater extent than they might think/ .
think.&apos;expedient, though there would always he a risk that subordinate Commanders might commit excesses or go beyond their ins truet-ions.&apos; It will be, understood, but I desire again to &apos;emphasis as strongly as I can,, the point that- I am dealing with this question solely from its legal and not in any way from Its political aspect.   Whether the  -proclamation of Martial Law would be -likely to embitter feeling or produce sympathy, or support^BHe rebels either in Ireland or outside Or1 the reverse, whether it would be likely to,cause labour, trade, or other troubles Inside or outside Ire-land, whether it would tend to cause the rebellion to spread outside Ireland or the reverse, whether the Government have suffi-cient military force at their disposal to effectively, enforce Martial La1&quot; and are pre-pared to use it, and what political conse-quences would be likely to follow, all ; these are questions upon which it Is en-tirely outside my province te express an opinion., . though they would undoubtedly have to be.most carefully weighed before any decision could be arrived at, and although, they may. be more important factors than the legal powers of the Executive.The. following are precedents for the proclamation and enior cement of Martial Law in Ireland. (a)   In 1798 Lord Camden being Lord Lieutenant issued two Orders. in Council and Proclamations . of Partial Law*&apos;  These were com-municated to both Houses of ... Parliament who by addresses to His Excellency expressed their entire approbation.   It was after the rebellion had been suppressed that Wolfe Tone&apos;s case 27 How. State Trials page 613,occurred. After this case an Act (39 Geo. Ill c^ll) Was passed in 1799 by the Irish Parliament which legsl-ised the continuance of Martial Law whether the ordinary Courts of Common Law were open or not., This Statute recognised the acknowledged Prerogative of His Majesty to resort to the exercise of Martial liar/ without the author-ity of an Act of Parliament. An Act of Indemnity (41 Geo.III c.104) was subsequently passed-
(b) In 180&amp;-4totJ^ in l                  Ireland by an Act of the Parliament ofthe United Kingdom 43 Geo, IIIo. &apos;117 bu the power to declare Martial Law under the prorogates, in districts where rebellion exists was not doUbted,(c) Ih 1833 a form of Martial Law was again&apos; ihtroduced by Statute in Iceland bi* the prerogative of the Crown to declare Martial law was again recognised inthe statute.The Precedents&apos; in Ireland therefore rather point tt the introduction of Martial Law by legislation though the Prerogative power without Parliamentary sanction is undoubted.   If it were not thought desirable to proclaim Martial Law under the Prerogative,.any special additional powers required e.g. that.of inflicting death sentences by Military. Courts, might perhaps,be obtained by Statute, ,   This course would have the additional advantage that no such question as that raised in Wolfe ToneTs case referred to above could arise and the Executive would have express Parliamentary saactitin to support them. This, however, again raises political considerations as to which i can express no opinion.(Signed) f, Casael.J.A.G.he Right Hon. Sir Hamar Greenwood, Bart.,
