Minister of TransportsInterim Revision of Railway Rates ...Tolls .t Fares,,^ Charges .. July 1920.Y/e the Rates Advisory Committee appointed under Section 21 of the Ministry of Transport Act, 1919, duly received the reference from you dated 7th July, 1920, desiring us to advise what Increases should be made in the rates fares tolls dues and charges of the Railway Companies of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland so as to yield by the end of June, 1921, the total deficit of  54,500,000 per annum which commenced to accrue on the 1st April, 1920, treating the Irish Railway Companies as a separate unit, the deficit in respect of the last named railways being assumed to be at the rate of  2,200,000 per annum*   We are further asked to consider what increases should be made in charges for season tickets and in workmen1s fares and other fares lower than ordinary fares which had been the subject of your remit to our Committee of the 5th May,, 1920*Upon the question of what exact sura must be raised to satisfy this requirement we had the evidence of Sir J.George Beharrell, D8S*0*, Director General of the Finance and Statistical Department of the Ministry of Transport, who pointed out that the computation, of this figure must depend in some measure upon the date at which the respective increases are brought into operation, but subject to certain qualifications he estimated that if the date up to which the new rates fares and charges are to remain in&quot;force . may be taken as the 31st July, 1921, instead of the 30th June, 1921, the total amount per annum required to make good within the time in question the total deficit for Great Britain will be  72,000,000 upon the assumption that the increases are brought into operation on the 1st september next.
We observed from a statement made in Parliament that        (J$you do not propose to bring the increases in Passenger Pares intooperation before the 5th August-next, but even with that date inview we consider that it is important that you should receive our recommendations upon Passenger Fares at the earliest possible date,and that it is desirable that ;ve should make an interim reportdealing only with Passenger Pares in order that notice may be given of the proposed changes in sufficient time for them to be operativeby the 5th August, 3.920, if that is the data selected.   We propose,therefore, in this report, to deal only with passenger fares includ-ing workman&apos;s Pares and the rates to be charged for Season Tickets,reserving the   question of merchandise by passenger train to be dealtwith in our further report upon the rates to be charged for the carr-iage of merchandise.In our opinion it is not possible to lay down any abstractrule as to the relative proportion which revenue from passengers ought to bear to revenue from goods.   The two cardinal rules whioh we conceive govern the fixing of rates and fares is (a) that except for some very special reason of policy no rate or fare should be less than the cost to the railways of conveying&apos; the traffic and (b) that no rate or fare can be charged which is greater than the traffic will bear.   Between this minimum and this maximum a great variety of considerations may properly be taken into account, but the two rules above mentioned must always be the governing considerations.in 19.13 the proportion of passenger revenue to freight rev-enue was-as 46,.09 to 53.91 (See Board of Trade Returns) and for the first four months of the present year (1920) the proportion of passen revenue to freight revenue was as   43,8 to 56.2 (See the evidence of Sir Sam Pay p,103, Q.1911) in each case the receipts from good3 carried by passenger train being treated as passenger revenue. Upon consideration of these f igures., and on the ground that the passenger traffic was the &quot;more vulnerable&quot;&apos;, the representatives of the railway companies recommended that the allocation of the increased revenue for the/
total from Passengers.  30,500,0003*   By various increases in the charges   )for merchandise by Passenger- train )   3,750,000 s and $jgoak room charges.         )&apos;     34,250,000At a later stage of our enquiry revised figures were submit-ted to us showing that If the suggested Increases for passenger fares and goods carried by passenger train should be brought into operation on the 1st August, 1920, and continued until 31st July, 1921, the annual rate at which the sum to be raised from this source^would be reduced from  34,250,000 to  26,400,000 or at the rate of  7,850,000 &apos; less per annum.   If these Increases are only brought into operation on the let September, 1920, and continued until 3lst July, 1921, the total annual rate would be  29,300,000, which is  2,900,000 greater than if the increases are brought into operation on the 1st August, 1920.We consider it of great importance to make the increase on Passenger fares as moderate as. is possible, having regard to the necessity of raising the necessary amount and -not placing an undue proportion of the increase upon freight rates, and we accordinglyare/the future should be from passenger revenue 40 per cent and from, freight revenue 80 per cent of the whole.   On that footing and assuming that the new passenger fares would not come into operation till 1stSeptember, 1920, and continue only to 30th June, 1921, they calculated that it was necessary to raise  26,150,000 in the 10 months between those dates which ten months usually produce only 77$ of the annual revenue from passengers,^so that it would be incumbent on them to provide passenger income at the rate of  34,250,000 per annum.   They proposed to raise the necessary sum by rates on an.annual basis as followss-1.   By increasing ordinary Passenger fares)      ^ vjqq ,000 so as to be 100$ above pre war rates ) *     &apos;2&amp;   By Increasing in the same proportion n(a) Season and Tradersf tickets. b,ouu,ouo(b) Workmenfs Fares.  2,800,000
are of opinion that if as a result of advising that theincreased fares shall take effect from the earlier datewe can recommend a smaller total Increase than would other*wise be the case, we ought so to advise.   We do notoverlook the fact that August is the month in which most people tajrce their holiday, but we take note that If the5th August is fixed as the date for the commencement of the        Jnew fares the whole of those taking only the week- end and bank holiday and the great majority of those who take the firstIfortnight of August or the whole of August as their holiday will have booked at the old fare3 and If, they take return tickets will be able to return at the old fares, so that the       \ holiday makers who suffer from the increase in the fares being fixed as from the 5th August instead of the 1st September I will be only those who. /bake their holiday in the latter part of August.   Having regard, to these facts we consider that the reduction in the total amount to be raised outweighs the objections to fixing the earlier date, particularly in view -of the fact that travellers who bear the burden of the increase in August will equally with others receive the benefit of the reduced increase which will take effect in respect of all \ journeys taken by them throughout the succeeding eleven months.It will be observed that the proposal of the Hailway Companies involves increasing passenger fares so that they shall be 100 per cent above pre-war fares.   This is substantially the same as fixing single third class fares at 2d per mile instead of Id. per mile as the great majority of such fares were frefore-. the war and 1-ld per mile as they have been since the 1st January 1917.   At the time the increase of 50 % or a ha If Denny4).per mile was made as from the last mentioned  .$a-te the intention was rather to restrict unnecessary travel than to produce revenue The immediate effect of the increase in fares was to produce additional  revenue at a rate   lower   than
50$    the returns for 1917 showing that the revenue from, ordinary faresLrose only -by 12.9 per cent that from Reason Tickets (to which no addition wan made) by 25,5 per cent and from workmenfs fares (which also remained unaltered) by 23.8&quot;per cent showing a total increase of 14.8 per cent.     It must however be borne in mind that strong appeals were made at that time to the public not to travel, that the number of trains was greatly reduced and travelling was very uncomfortable and that a large portion of the population was engaged in the Army or upon munition work and travelled free.    Further it is to be remembered that the fact that neither season ticket rates nor workmen5s fares had. been increased, enabled many passengers to turn over from ordinary fares to these specially low rates.    When, however, season ticket rates were in May, 1918, increased by \Q% for distances under 12-1 miles and 20$ for distances of and over 12f miles, this increase did not check the revenue from this source, for in 1918 Season, tickets produced revenue 24..4 per cent above the revenue for 1917 and in 1919 there was a further rise of 19.5 per cent ever the revenue for 1918.    The proportional falling off In total&quot;passenger receipts was moreover more than made good by 1919, in which&apos;year the revenue from Ordinary fares was 78*6 per cent above the 1916 revenue, that from Season tickets (which had been in the meantime increased as above mentioned) ^vas 86.8 per cent above the 1916 Revenue and that from Workmen&apos;s-fares (which had not been increased) was 21.2 per cent above the 1916 revenue.    The experience derived from&quot;the increase In fares made in 1917 and 1918 is however of very uncertain value.It is to be borne in mind that not only is a large amount of passenger travel voluntary, but also that an increase in fares may be met by short distance, passengers transferring themselves to Trams, Omnibuses, Charabancs and motor cars or walking the wholeor
or portions tf the journey.    We are Informed that there is a grea growth in the number of motor vehicles plying for hire, and that t distances they ccver are being extended.     As regards long distanc railway journeys, it must further be taken into account that many are taken for the purpose cf enjoying a holiday and it is open to the travellers to choose a resort nearer to their homes than has been their custom;    while other travellers proposing to make long journeys. .7viniting relatives or for other purposes not absolutely necessary may abandon the trip if the cost Is substantially IncreasTaking these matters into consideration we are of opinior that ordinary passenger fares ought net to bear so great an increas as a penny per mile tn 3rd class fares ever pre-war rates, having regard to the danger of producing so great a reduction of traffic as would seriously impair the aggregate receipts, but we think thst an increase cf 16-2/3 per cent or 2d. in the shilling on the pres-er fares might safely be imposed and. If such increase is brought into operation on August 5th, 1920, we recommend that this increase be made.     If made. It will bring fares up to a standard of 75 per cent above pre-war fares.We considered whether any higher rate of increase should be Imposed on first and second   class fares than on third class fares, but taking into account that, to do so, in addition to reducing the total number of travellers, would probably result in a number exchanging into a lower class of carriage, we are of opinion that this would not be advantageous to the revenue of the Railway Companies.&apos;tfe have in the case of Passenger fares been guided mainly by what the traffic will bear.     We did not find, it possible to discover from, the representatives of the railway companies V-e relative cost of carrying freight and passengers.The&apos;
The Ministry of Transport however furnished us with figures . which gave      an estimate of the cost to the Companies under the conditions at present existing of running a passenger train per mile as 10/lQ, and cf running a freight train as 18/11 without any allowance in either case for interest en capital being in the proportion of 36.4 to 63.4*     This would justify treating passenger fares on more favourable terms in comparison with freight rates than those proposed by the Railway Companies..We deal under separate headings with workmen&apos;s fares -and Season and traders tickets.    There are a number of other fares lower than the ordinary fare, but we have determined to p*stptne the detailed consideration of these so as not to delay the presentation of Mir report on the main question of ordinary fares.It is extremely difficult to arrive at any certain estimate of the amounts of revenue which will result from the adoption ef fur recommendation in regard %o Passenger fsires. We reserve the consideration of this question,until we deal with the revenue from the rates to be charged for the carriage of goods.We advise that as soon as possible after the new fares are brought into operation the correct actual fare should be printed upon the tickets.    We consider the present practice of printing the pre-war fare very undesirable.Our attention was called to the fact that the Cheap Trains Act, 1883, (referred to in another part of this Report) provides that fares not exceeding one penny per mile (which was then the normal third class fare) should be exempt from the Passenger duty payable under the Railway Passenger Duty Act, 1842 (5 and 6 Vic. c.79) at the rate of 5 per cent upon all sums received from passengers, and it was pointed out that, if theeffect
effect of increasing the fares for third class passengers abe^l Id. per mile is to bring the receipts from this class of traffic within the purview of the Passenger Duty, allowance must be made fttr this additional outgoing.    The question as to whether the Passenger &amp;uty should be imposed In respect of the third class   j fares charged at the rate now recommended is one for the Chancel&quot; cf the Exchequer and Parliament, and we do not presume to advise upon it.
excursion and other cheap fares,Our attention waB called to the question of Excursion Tickets.Week-End Tickets, tourist/and other Tioto?tc at less than ordinary fares.    These&quot;were in operation before the War, but were mostly abolished in March 1915.    There is a strong demand on the part of the public for their reinstitution.While we think that many of the pre-war fares were unnecessarily low we are of opinion that some Excursion and other low fares are, desirable and we invited the representatives of the Railway Companies to give us their opinion - Sir Herbert Walker, the General Manager of the London and South Western Railway after conferring with the General Managers of the other principal railways attended and gave us the result of their consultation.    He informed us that in tho present state of the Rolling Stock particularly the Engines of the Railway Companies it is not physically possible to provide for the trains necessary for restoring low fares - either at the Week-End or during the week.    He pointed cut that the number of.passengers now travelling is greatly in excess of those travelling before the War - number travelling in Great Britain on the controlled Railways at ordinary fares being for 1919, 1,066,000,000 as against 810,000 000travelling at ordinarv and excursion fares in 1913. . We also learned that tho number of passengers travelling at Workmen&apos;s fares has increased from 255,000,000 in 1913 to 411,900,000 in 1919 and that the number of season tickets has increased during the same period from 569,310, to 901,082.Sir Herbert Walker also added that the ^introduction of excursion fares would deprive the Railways of much Income, as many travelling at ordinary fares would turn over to the Excursion fares.In this matter we feel that the opinion of the Managers of the Railways must prevail;   we cannot therefore recommend that at.the present time Excursion fares should be restored, but we think that at as early a date as possible.the practice of issuing ExcursionTiolcetsTickets, Week-End Tickets, and TouristTourist Tickets, should be resumed -although we think that tho rates should before the War,Should TR&amp;XJiA**4 ^
V/ORKMEN13   fares.&quot; &apos; HUpon the question of Workmen^ Pares it has been suggested that the maintenance of Workmen1 s faros was a matter of obligation because the Cheap Trains Act 1883 constituted a bargain between the State and the Railway Companies . the Railway Companies having undertaken to give us consideration for the Repoal of the passenger duty, on faros not exceeding one penny a mile additional accommodation in workmenTs trains j   and before us it was even st&amp;tod that the bargain extended to continuing the Workmen&apos;a Fares at the rates which existed before the War.    To the proposition that there was some bargain support is given by the Report of the Royal Commission on the Housing of the Working Classes in 188&amp; which stated that there was such a bargain but an examination of tho evidence before that Commission and of the --terms of the Cheap Trains Act 1883 disposes of that theory,    Mr. Joseph Chamberlain, President of the Board of Trade who was responsfb for the Bill in 1683 expressly, stated at the enquiry in 1065 that ho did not understand that that Act was in the nature of such a bargain, and Sir Srancia Hop wood (now Lord Southborough) j^sf then Permanent Secretary of the Board of Trade in giving evidence before the Select Committee on Workmen^ Trains in July 1903 supported that view and pointod out that the Act was passed as the result of a recommendation of a Select Committee of the House of Commons in 1876 who advised tha tho Passenger duty was an undesirable one to maintain longer than was necessary from a fiscal point of view and recommended its repeal whenever the state of public revenue would permit and further recommend od that until the finances of the State should warrant the abolition
of the Tax it should be restricted to fares over Id, per mile. Mr. Childers the Chancellor of the Exchequer notified the reduction in his Budget Speech of April 5th, 1883 saying   &quot;we propose, then, to take off the duty from all fares of Id. per mile and less.1&apos; There appears to have been no discussion in either House of Parliamenl when the Bill for Cheap Trains was considered upon the question of the reduction in Passenger Duty being in consideration of the Grant of accommodation for Workmen at special fares*,   The Cheap Trains Act 1808 after providing that fares not exceeding the rate of one penny a mile shall be exempt from duty enacted that if tho Board of Trado had reason to believe that proper and sufficient Workmenls trains are not &quot;provided at such fares and at such times between six o* clock in-the evening . and eight o1clock in the morning as; appeared, to it to bo reasonable it might, after enquiry, order that such accommodation at such fares as, having regard to the circumstances might appear reasonable be provided - and if tho Company on whom the order was made refuse or-neglected to comply with the order it should lose the benefit of the Act and be liable for passenger duty as if the same had not been varied by the Act.The, Railway Companies acted liberally in the matter of these Trains, and the Select Committee onWorkmen1 a Trains reported in 1905 and after stating that when tho Act of 1883 was passed, 6 railway companies-vere already under statutory obligation to run in all 11 Workmen1s Trains, and that 11 railway Companies in fact provided daily in London and the neighbourhood 110 Workmen&apos;s Trains, added that since the Act of 1883 it appeared that 14 Hallway Companies had clauses inserted in their private Acts imposing a statutory obligation to provide accommodation for Workmen.
oThe two earliest Acts providing for accommodation for &quot;the labouring classes&quot; are the Metropolitan Hallway (flinsbury Circus Extension) Act 1861 end the North London Railway (City Branch) Act 1061 each requiring one train in each direction on each week-day for certain short distances &quot;at fares not exceeding one penny per passenger for each Journey&quot;.    These were followed in&apos;1064 by six Acts affecting the Great Eastern Hallway, and five other railways, in oach oase a single train in each direction being required per diom. The case of the Great Eastern Railway has often been oitod for it covered the long distance from Edmonton and Walthamstow to Liverpool Street and the fare   was limited to 2d, for the return Journey.)    This requirement was understood to be in place of obliging the Railway to provide dwellings for the population displaced by the extension of the Station at Liverpool street, and if any of such persons oould possibly be affected by the present proposals,some case might be made for holding that there. j.$as a statutory bargain that one train peas day should be run in each direction for their benefit -but persons who never lived in the Area where the houses were removed can have no such olaim.    The Companies serving the Metropolis have however, moro than fulfilled all their obliga-tions and in 1913 according to the evidence furnished to us by the London County Council there were 1,001 cheap trains connecting 553 Stations with London, and of these trains there were  85 which carried workmen at fare;-&apos; for tho return ,journey/
journey not exceeding 2d.     In 1913 the Railways of Great Britain carried 255,684,307 passengers at Workmen1s fares and in 1919 they carried 411,904,039,    The Irish Railways carried in 1913, 1,038,615 and in 1919, 3,822,900 which shows a gonerana provision for this class of traffic.We have cited tho foregoing facts to dispose of the claim advanced that good faith required the continuance of the existing Workmen1a fares, and to give the history of these Cheap Fares for the better &quot;understanding of the present position.    Since the original grant of these facilities there has been a great change In the situation. Prior to 1914* the normal wage of an unskilled labourer was  0/- to 25/- a week and of a skilled: workman from  2 tc  2,10/-, whereas now the unskilled labourer receives about ^3. 10/r as a minimum a week and the- wages..of skilled labour are correspondingly greater;      tho cost of operating trains has in the meantime more than doubled.The Acts never specifically defined the classes who were to be entitled to the Workmen!s fares end in practice it was -found impossible to distinguish between those who were legally entitled to the benefit og the Acts and those -who were not, so that any person presenting himself within the hours at which WorkmenTs Trains were run was allowed to travel by those trains at the reduced fare and as a consequence it became merely a question of early travelling, The time tables on tho railways differed in some oases the limitation was the time of booking and -in others the scheduledtine/
time for the arrival cf tho train at tho terminus;   and ovon where tho conditions were the same the hours were nc^ j uniform, but it may he said that the Workmen1 s Trains all arrived at the Terminus not later then 6 a.ra.    This product the result that the Clerk, office worker, (both malo and female) and shopmen whose hours of work commenced at 9 a.n. or later got no benefit from theso trains*At the time workmenrs trains were instituted Clerical I work was better paid than/manual labour, but It cannot be said that now in the case of the great mass of Clerical workers this is the caso, and having regard to tho wages now paid to the manual labourer there appears to be no reasj why he should be carried either at rates which do not pay the cost of tho trains which carry him or are substantially! below those charged to clerical workers, Indeed the represel t&amp;tives of the workmen who appeared before us did not suppoi any claim that any part of the oost of their transport shouJ be borne by other classes of tho Community,1We found great difficulty In ascertaining the propercost to bo attributed to tho running of a workroans train.usAdequate information wa3 given/by Mr. frank Pick as regardsI the Underground group of railways, but his figures referred only to electric trainsworking on lines carrying short distance passengers only and no Goods,    Moreover on the Underground lines workmen in the morning are travelling in both directions which in. not the case with the main lines -generally.    His figures therefore cannot be used as more   I than a general indication of tho expenses and of their ratal of increase on the main lines - Mr, Pick told us that the average working cost per passenger was le48 of a penny in ! and 1.60 of a penny for the first three months of 1920 to  l: whioh must be added ,20 of a penny for repairs and renewals! -and/ I
.15-3 h 3,43 of a penny for fixed charges, so that the cost of carrying a passenger in Maroh 1920 was 2.31 of a pew or if a reasonable return ia to be made on Capital 3.39 of a penny but ho added that costs have esinoa risen and are still rising.    He also Informed us that tho receipts from Workmen rs Pares were 1.53 of a penny for the single Journey and that upon the average tho Workmen travelled a greater distance than the ordinary passenger,    We were also told that the coat of running Wor toons Trains is higher thou that of ordinary Trains both by reason of the fact that thoy start at very early hours and in the case of lines othor than the Underground group that stopping at every station they are more expensive to work&apos;than through Trains.    These, facts said figures show that upon tho Hallways, represented by Mr, Pick work-mon are carried at a substantial loss and we have no doubt that this is also the case fpon the othor Railways and particularly upon tho Great Eastern Hallway and tho Hallways serving Glasgow In whose cases the Workmen^ fares are very low*    On the last day of oup enquiry further figures were given on behalf of th$ Great Eastern Railway whioh showed that there was a large loss on tho Running of their workmenfs trains,--There is no standard rate for Workmen1 s Fares,    We were told that about m por cent of such fares were before tho War at the rateof a single third olaas faro for the return jour nay, but otherfaros of this class vary down to Sd for the return Journey fromIjnfiold Town to Liverpool Street, a distance of 10$ milos each way.The following are instances of some of the very low fares,&apos;&apos;Pre-War     Present     Daily rate Workmen1 s Distance   3rd Singlo 3rd Single of 3rd     Fare forMica,    fare.FareClass Sea- BoturnGlasgow to Paisley EnfiolA to 1.1 Pool St, Lower B&amp;mcn-ton to I-&apos; Pool Street.

This proposal was made at the time when Passenger faro stpod at 50 per cent above the pre-war fares and before any proposal had been made to increase the ordinary passenger fares. &apos;   The Railway Companies further recognised that some exception should be made in oases whero tho Workmen^ Fares had been exceptionally low, in that case recommending that the full increase should not be made at once, but by stages, the first increase.heing limited so as not to bo &quot;greater than 200 per cent above the present Workmenrs Fare.     Their Witnesses appeared to be not disinclined to accept a proposal that long distance workmen*s fares should be proportionately lower than short distance workmen1s fares.
Wo take into conaideration tho fact that Workmen1 s Trains aro run at an hour when there is little other traffic, and that these trains are run very full.   We also bear in mind the fact that it is largely due to these low faros that the working population of London and other cities has been attracted to go Into the country with a resulting advantage to health and the general benefit of tho community and we are moat desirous not to counteract this tendency.We are of opinion and recommend that the following scale of charges should be Immediately adopted.;For any distance not exceeding 2:miles 3d. for the return journey.For distance between 2 and 2-l/3rd miles 5j-d.     &quot; &quot;2-1/3 and 2-2/3rd 11 H     &quot; &quot;2-2/3 and 3 v 4-Jd.     11 &quot;3 and 3-l/3rd        &quot; 5 d,     ri 11S-l/3rd and 3-2/3rd miles 5jd.      ,!3-2/3rd and 4 miles 6- d.      i:       &quot;-For distances over 4 miles - 6d. for tho first 4 miles and id. for every half mile over 4 miles.With a provision that no increase shall exceed 200 per cent of the existing fares.We are of opinion that the above figures should beadopted for the present but that gradually these fares shouldbe brought to such a level as shall be dictated by public policy,if;  -In reference to the question of the workman&apos;s ability topay the following figures are significant.   In 1913 before the shorter hours of work were introduced the number using theWorkmen1 s Trains between 5 and 7 o! clock from Enfield Town andlr$/Q *Xlopaying 2d.&apos; mxs 5,689 and those travelling between J and 8o&apos; clock and paying - ^LihmL^il^MLJli^* per day were 3,324, butthat in 1919, the number travelling daily between 5 and 7 Jo1clock was only 2,617, and those travelling between 7 ^and/n tr tttt Tt I!n it iti; it tttt tt J!
The/        %and 8 o&apos;clock were 6,034, showing&apos;,&apos;&quot;that voluntarily 2,710 ornot less than fifty per cent have turned over to the later&quot;2.7 * trains at rates ffmrr-Ofl&quot; t6&quot; aoO per cent higher.Tbe Reference to us includes the question of the Timesat which Workmen1 a trains should be run.    It was urged upon us that the hour to which the cheap tickets should be grantedshould be extended to 9 o? clock and it was pointed out that thiswould enable the Clerical Class to obtain the&apos; advantage of cheaptravelling.    We have much sympathy with this request, but weare unable to recommend it.    Part of the reason which we feeljustifies us in recommending the continuance of these low faresis that the trains are run at times when there is little othertraffic on the Railways - Further it is obvious that thepossibility of handling the very large traffic flowing Into the big cities depends on distributing the traffic over the morninghours and that to extend tho hours for Workmen1s trains to 9 of clock would have the result (a) of bringing many of those whoheretofore have travelled before 8 of clock into the time of betwee8 and 9 of clock and (b) of inducing many of those who havetravelled between 9 and 10 o&apos;clock to make their journeys earlierso as to got the benefit of the cheap faros.     The combined effectof these two causes would be to congest tho traffic between 8 and o*clock to such an extent as to render the terminal stationsInsufficient for their purpose.     It was given in evidence beforeus that, the numbers carried daily on the South Eastern Railwayinto London were in a test week as follows:-Between 7 and 8 os clock - 23,585. 11 8 and 9 o&apos; clock 23. .C64. &quot;      9 and 10 o1clock      24J303.
the trains required to carry them being&apos;136 in number.   Itmust be obvious that to transfer a substantial proportion ofthose travelling in the earliest and of those travelling atthe latest of these hours to the period between 8 and 9 o&apos;clockwould create a dangerous congestion.   It appears to us thatthe regulation of the hours at which Cheap Tickets-are to beissued is a matter of railway management which must largelybe left to the expert railway officials and that a Committee suchas ours is not competent to lay down rules to bind the railwayson this point except on very general lines,    A practice adoptedby the Great Eastern Railway of granting from Enfield Town the cheapest fare up to 7 a.m,, a higher fare between 7,0 and 7.30 cheapa.m,, a thirds/fare higher than the others up to 8 a.m., has great advantages in the way of distributing the traffic but wo think that oaoh railway Company must be left to settle this question for itself provided that it does not fail to offer proper facilities up to a reasonable hour, the securing of which is already provided for.&quot;In our opinion, It is not desirable to attempt to define tho classes of persons &quot;entitled to the benefit of these trains, and we think It would bo better to recognise that any person travelling by such Trains is entitled to do so at the reduced faro, and to mark tho principle wo recommend that the name &quot;Workmen5s Trains&quot; should be abandoned and in future, these trains should bo callod &quot;Cheap early trains&quot;.It must not bo taken that these recommendations are to govorn tho Underground Group of Railways which will require separate consideration when the Bill relating to them now before Parliament becomes law, and the portions of the Metropolitan Railway which fall within the Metropolitan Area should be .considered at the same time.

The justification for the high ratio in the case of short distances appeared from the evidence of Fir. Pick, speaking of the London&apos; Electric Railways who told us that on.a test day on the Main line Section of the District Railway it was found that on an average each season ticket was used for three single journeys.   From a table of Season Ticket charges for long distances on the London and Jorth Western Railway the following specimens are taken, the rates being after the 20^&apos; increase made in 1918:-Miles First Class Season.        Third Class Season.
London season tickets are very largely used by business men and women who come daily to town to earn their living and it is right fchat the cost of travel should be kept withinmoderate limits.To the Railway Companies this traffic is satis-factory even at low fares, seeing that it is regular and goodtrain loads are provided at hours which are well ascertained.When ordinary passenger fares were increased by 50fo as from 1st January 1917, the object was to restrict unnecessary travel rather than to produce revenue, and no increase was then made in Season ticket rates, but in May 1918 with a view 0$ obtaining money the charges for Season tickets were increased for distances under 12-1 miles by 10$ and for distances of and over 12-g miles by 2ofL The fact that the rates for ordinary tickets were increased in a greater proportion than those for Season tickets, resulted in a substantial increase in the number of the latter and it is recorded that in 1913 the number of Season tickets Issued, on the British Controlled railways *?tas 569,310 while in 1919 it was 901,082.It was urged upon us by the representatives of the Season Ticket holders that as the amount paid for such tickets.are In most cases part of the necessary cost of lifting no increase or only a small increase should be made in the rates. We sympathise with this argument, but we feel that at a time when all the costs of living have risen there is no valid ground for excepting this item, and throwing upon others the share in the increased expenses of operating the railways which is properly attributable to this class of traffic..We accordingly recommend and advise that the charges for Season tickets should be increased by 50 per cent over the charges in force before May 1918,
There has long been a custom among Railway Companies    JWjof issuing to those traders -who send large yearly consignments of goods by Rail tickets for use by their employees at rates lower than ordinary season tickets.   These   traders tickets are not Issued for distances less than 50 miles in England and 30 miles in Scotland.   Before the War the amount of traffic consigned necessary to qualify a trader to receive such a ticket was in Great Britain so much as would produce the sum of  300 in goods rates.   This was increased during the War to  50$ and when the rate were Increased on 15th January 1920 the figure was increased to  750 representing approximately the same amount of traffic asms previously represented by  500*   A trader whose traffic represents double the qualification is entitled to two Traders tickets, one whose traffic represents three times the qualification is entitled to three traders tickets and so on.   The reduction allowed on Traders tickets is not uniform on the various British Railways, but the following figures taken from a table supplied by the London and North&apos;Western Railway may be taken as fairly representative:-DistancePercentage of Traders Tickets below&quot;Ordinary&quot;season rickets.First ClassThird Class.50 miles. 100 miles. 150 miles. 200 miles. 300 miles. 400 miles. 500 miles. 600 miles.45 37 35 57 46 51 54 5639 32 33 37 46 51 54 51When/
When ordinary Season ticket rates were advanced 20% the rates for Traders Ticketsvere advanced in the same proportion.   The extent to which Traders Tickets are issued varies greatly as between the Railway Companies, as appears from the following figures of receipts in 1919.Ordinary Season Tickets.   Traders Tickets! L. &amp; N*W.Rly.  511,000  299,000G.W. Rly.  560,641  121,269G.C.Rly.  129^356  34,040the respective proportions of Traders to Ordinary season tickets being 58$, 22$ and 26$.The origin of the grant of these tickets on suchfavourable terms was no doubt the desire of the companies in times of severe competition to attract traffic to theirown lines, although they may be useful in assisting tradersto extend their business.We think that there is no good reason for continuingsuch large concessions to the Traders doing a largebusiness, and we recommend that in future no greater reduction should be made on Traders Tickets as compared withordinary season tickets than 20 per cent.   We do alsoadvise that when the rates for the carriage of goods are increased as is now proposed the amount of Traffic necessaryto qualify tor the issue of a Traders Ticket should beincreased so as to be Traffic producing goods rates tothe amount of  1,000.
