^S30RE .        gggEAL OF SECTION 3 QF THB MtTOITIONSOFJfAB ,(jgSigjI0. P. 1685. APT .1917.Memorandum &quot;by the Minister of labour.A number of enquiries and complaints have been addressed to the Ministry of Labour from employers&apos; organisations (notably the Engineering and National Employers1 Federations) and from private employers on the uncertainty of their position under Station 0 of the Munitions of War (Amendment) Act, 1916, and Seotioa 3 of the Munitions of War, (Amendment) Aot, 1917,  section 9 of the 1916 Act, whieh hm Veen interpreted moat widely both by Government $eoartmsnts and in the Courts, defines oertaln el&amp;gie&amp;s of work directly or indirectly essential for war purposes as &quot;munitions&quot; wort; while Sect ion 3 of the 1917 aot, whose m^ml i% more urgently desired, provides with oertaln except lone for the giving of m&amp; week18 aotioe, or wages in lies thereof, by either party &amp;e$lri&amp;f to terminate a contract of employment for such work.It m&amp; rec?o$niee&amp; that, so&amp;se^uent upon the tram&amp;fer from Government oontrabt work to private tr&amp;do, it&apos;was frequently difficult to decide whether a mm was still engaged upon &quot;munition^&apos; work or h,w far his employment wa$ being continued under a oontrwt under which h&amp; was previously iso engaged,.-The question was accordingly considered of inserting a clause in the Industrial Courts Bill or other Bill  or the purpose of the repeal of the clauses in questions   Bo suitable Bill has, however, been introduced in..Parliament glace the question became prominent, and it has been decided that a special Bill for the purpose is necessary.Correspondence has taken place between the Ministry of Labour and the Ministry of Munitions on the question of the/responsibility15./7A383.
responsibility for tho introduction of the Bill.   The Ministry Of Labour held the view that as the Ministry of Munitions was responsible for tho inclusion of thetaro clauses in tho Munitions of War Acts, they should equally be responsible for their repeal. The Minister of Munitions has, however, recently suggested that in view of the proposed early dissolution of his Department this duty should be undertaken by the Ministry of Labour, but that, in view of the necessity of retaining for the present certain olauses of the Munitions of War  Acts, no steps should bo taken to rosoind or modify Section 9 of the 1916 Act, whioh defines munitions work, and that Section 3 of the, 1917 Act should alone be repealed.-   I havo now aocopted these views and therefore propose, if none of my colleagues dissent, to introduce a short Bill in tho House of Commons for this purpose Immediately.A copy of the draft Bill is at cached; there is, so far aa I am aware, no reason to anticipate opposition to the Bill; and I expect to be able to pass it through all stages without taking up more than a small portion of Parliamentary tims.(Initialled) T.J.M..Ministry of Labour, 15.7.SO.15/7A383.
