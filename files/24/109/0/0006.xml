IBIS DOCTMEHT IS THE PROPERTY. OF HIS BRITAOTC MAJESTY1 S OCTORNMENTvmm3ENTIAL.H.H. 23.THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH (MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS) BILL.Memorandum by the Minister of Health.IThifl Bill deals partly with housing matters and partly with matters of Public Health and Local Government administrative machinery, with regard to which experience has shown the necessity for an amendment of the existing law.Certain of the matters dealt with are of very real urgency, aid the Bill as a whole will increase the efficiency of Local Government and Public Health services throughout the country.  Many of the amendments proposed havo long boon desired by Local Authorities and, so fares can be ascertained from the various Associations of Local Authorities, the Bill is likely to receive their very cordial support.Clause 1 enables Local Authorities to hire compuleorily for. a period not exceeding 3 years from the commencement of the Act houses suitable for the working-classes, which havo ,been. allowed, by their owners to remain unoccupied for  ; a certain period.   There is a great deal of evidence to show that owners of houses are often in the habit of keeping their houses unoccupied in order to bo able to soil them outright with vacant possession at the excessive values which now prevail, this being in fact the only method, so long as the Rent Restriction Act is in force, whoreby profiteering iri working class houses can be carried on.  The action of house owners in this rospect has caused much resentment throughout the country, and the Ministry of Health were pressed to insert provisions for the compulsory hiring of unoccupied houses in the recent Rent Restriction Act.   It was felt, however, that a clause to that effect would not
ause 4.^    This Clause is intended to remove serious ,legal difficulties which have arisen in connection with the carrying out by local authorities of housing schemes within the area of another local authority.    The provision of adecpxate sewerage arrangements is, under the Public Health Acts, an obligation on the local authority of the area, and for obvious reasons (and not least for the protection of the Exchequer) it is impossible to allow expenditure ton public health obligations to be charged against the housing scheme account.    But in many cases the local authority of a rural area is not in a position, financially or otherwise, to undertake the sewerage arrangements for a large housing scheme which is being carried out in their area by another local authority,    The very important L.C.C. scheme at Dagenham is a case in point.    At the same time the local authority which is carrying out the scheme has no legal power to expend money (except to a very limited extent) outside its own area on objects which, though essential to their housing scheme, yet do not in law form part of it.    Hence the clause provides for the approval of the Minister being givon to agreements between the two local authorities concerned, whereby the local authority carrying out the hous ing aftheme may either undertake the necessary sewerage works and recover the cost subsequently from the local authority of the area, or finance the latter until such time as the progress of the housing scheme nay h6ve increased sufficiently the rateable value of the area and provided the local authority with the means of sustaining the financial burden involved.
have &quot;been appropriate in that Act, but in view of the force of public opinion behind the demand it is desirable that the question should be dealt with as soon as possible.Clauso, 2, which extends the period during which subsidies may be granted tb private builders for a further 12 months, has already been sanctioned by the Cabinet.   Tho clause involves no additional charge on the Exchequer and has already been approved by the Cabinet.Clause 5 was approved by the Cabinet Housing Committee on the 24th June last.   This clause amends section 5 of the Housing (Additional Powers) Adi, 1919, which relates to the prohibition Hy local authorities of what is known as luxury building.   It has been approved by the Cabinet Committee on Housing.Clause Mk.   Section 7(2) of the Housing (Additional Powers) Act, 1919, enables the Minister by order to impose conditions on the raising of money by a County Council for the purpose of making housing loans to Local Authorities within their area.   The Comity Councils will not make these JwOans to Local Authorities unless power is given them to impose conditions on the local Authorities.to whom the money is lent which will secure the County Councils against 3.088/* Clause 4 enables this to be done, and without it one of the most effective methods of financing the housingschemes of smaller Local Authorities will be lost.JClauso ^ empowers Local Authorities to provide houses for persons employed by them.   This power is often urgently required by certain types of Authorities who are not.Housing Authorities.   The case of Isolation Hospital Committees is a case in point.  As a safeguard against sn extravagant use of the power the clause requires the consent of the Minister to be obtained.Clause w enables the Minister to fix from time to
39    1time the rate of interest which may &quot;bo charged by XoceJL. Authorities where they are authorised by statute to do certain- werks and recover the oxpenditure incurred from owners;   The rates-of&quot; irrteree*t fixed by the present law do not exceed 5$, with the result at the present day that the Local Authorities abstain from doing the work or can only do it at a loss to the rates,   In particular the power given by Section 28 of the Housing Act, 1919, of ropairing hou.ses unfit for habitation and recovering the cost from the owners is proving quite&apos; ineffective, because tho rate of interest specified in that section is limited to 5$*Clause \ gives the Minister, subject to certain safeguards, power to relieve Urban Authorities from tho nocessity for complying with the very stringent requirements of Section 174 of the Public Health Act, 1875, with regard to the making of contracts * These requirements havo caused very considerable difficulty in the case of housing contracts5 and it is thought that the proposed clause will meet with the approval of Local Authorities and eottractors generally. It may be pointed out that, curiously enough, the requirements of Section 174 have no application in the case of contracts made by Rural Authorities; and there seems to bo no sound reason why Urban Authorities should be in a worse position.Clause V enables Local Authorities to pay subscriptions to Associations or Institutions approved by the Minister,; which have for their object the assistance of Local Authorities in the.exercise and performance of their powers and duties., and also travelling and subsistence allowances, on a scale approved by the Iv&amp;nister, to their members who attend meetings of the Authority.   This clause follows the lines of a similar clause in tho Sducation(Administrativc Provisions) -Act, 1918, and, so far as regards the payment of travelling and subsistehace allowances, gives of feet,to recommendations of the Local Government&apos; Advisory Council    of the Minis try, though not to the full extent desired by thema
ClauBfcV enables persons suffering from incipient mental disorders, but not certified under the Lunacy Acts, to be received in Institutions approved by the Minister without exposing the persons receiving thorn to possible penalties under the provisions of the Lunacy Acts.   This clause is urgently desired by the i/anistry of Pensions for the purpose of the proper treatment of soldiers and ex-soldiers suffering from shell shock and has the warm support of the Medico-Psychological Association.    The safeguards contained in the clause are designed to remove all the grounds of opposition exhibited to the Mental Treatment Bill introduced in 1915,Clause       continues in force until Parliament otherwise determines certain sections of the Local Govern-ment (Emergency Provisions) Act, 1916, which expires at latest one year after the termination of the war.   Sections 7 and 8 of that Act have ^eff acted a very great saving of time and labour in dealing with the expenses of the Hetro-politan Asylums   -$Board and the claims on the Metropolitan Common Poor Fund, and it would be most inconvenient to. revert to the pre-tfar system during the interval which must elapse before the reform of the Poor Law can he carried into effect :   but Sections 12 and 14, which effect much needed simplification in the Ministry1 s own procedure, will (it is hoped) become permanent.Clause x8k enables (l?ut docs not compel) County Councils and Govnty Borough Councils to support and maintain general Hospitals.and to contribute on.terms approved by the Minister to Voluntary Hospitals, etc,, in their area.  At the present  time the,  County Councils  have no power to  provide hospitals   at all
and it is doubtful whether County Borough Councils have power to provide general hospitals.     In certain cases itis desirable that these Authorities should have power to take over and mail viaIn Poor Law Infirmaries which are no longer required by tho Boards of &quot;Guardians to whom they belong.    The Ministry of Health are of opinion that these transferences ought in the inioreats gone-rally of sick persons in large towns to be -encouraged to the fullest extent. &apos;Clansm in effect provides,   for the continuanceof a D.O.R.A. Regulation&apos;now in force which has proved of the greatest possible benefit   to the medical profession and to the sick.     It has the cordial support; of the Board of Trade and is approved by the makers of clinical thermometers.Clause i^T effects a useful amendment of the law relating to the inspection of food by enabling powers of inspection and seizure at present only exerciseable by Inspectors of fluisarices to be exercised by other Officers of the Local Authority designated for the purpose.Clause      enables Urban Authorities to- appoint more than one Inspector of Nuisances.     Rural Authorities already have this power and it :seems probable that the differentiation in the case of Urban Authorities is merely, due to an errorof drafting in the Public Health Act, 1875....   ^ , - :       - - &apos; - .Claure T5&quot;enables Officers of Local Authoritiesto invest in securities issued by tho Local Authority whom they serve (e,g-. Housing Bonds), without incurring the verydrastic penalties imposed on Officers of a Local Authority.who no come &quot;intorosted in any contract&quot; made with tho LocalAuthority. . .Clarse^H-effects a useful amendment of the-lewrelating to the supply of water.    There is&apos;no good reason why a&apos; Local Authority havj^awater supply in its area should
not by agreement supply other Local Authorities who want the water, even though their area does not march with that of the supplying authority.    This, however, cannot legally be done as the law stands at present.Clause -T7 gives the County Councils and taetro-politan Borough Councils a power with the consent of the Minister of appropriating land which is not required for the purpose for- which it was originally obtained.    The clause merely extends to the Local Authorities named a power enjoyed by all other Local Authorities, and is urgently required by them.IlClause IB&quot;, Suh^ej^ion^U puts County Councils in the same position as other Local Authorities so far as regards the term of repayment of their loans.Sub-section 12) enables Local Authorities to reborrow for the purpose of paying off a loan without obtaining a fresh sanction from the Minister, in addition to the sanction which was obtained to the raising of the original loan.Sub-section (5).   Local Authorities are given general powers to borrow money for sanitary purposes- water works, sewers &amp;c. with the sanction of the Minister of Health under Section 233 of the Public Health Act 1875.     But para. (2) of Section 234 of that Act provides that the sum borrowed shall not at any time exceed, with the balance of all.out-standing loans for sanitary purposes, the assessable value for two years of the premises assessable within the district. i have proposed that the operation of this paragraph shall be suspended for a period of 3 years.     But the Treasury whohave been consulted have rained objection._I, therefore askfor a off - tho Home Affairs Committee on^this^ point.The Urban District Councils Association have pressed upon me the necessity of removing the limitation on their
borrowing powers contained in para.(2) of Section 234 of the Public Health Act and I am satisfied that the alteration, in law proposed is essential.     Many cases have, come before me in which the limitation on the borrowing pavers of the Sanitary Authorities&apos; has precluded the carrying out of necessary Works of water supply, sewage, and so on, and unless the amendment which I propose is carried into effect there is a considerable risk that numbers of the hew houses which are now being built will not be provided with tho requisite water and drainage.I may point out that the alteration in the law which I propose will not obviate the necessity for the local authority obtaining sanction of the Ministry in every case.     Moreover, the limitation is contrary to all modern practice.     The general Acts which apply the Public Health Acts borrowing pov/ers to other purposes almost invariably provide that the limitation shall not apply to borrowing for purposes outside the Public Health Acts, and many local authorities have obtained local Acts removing the limitation.     The difficulty caused by the limitation has become more acute recently owing to the fact that the rise in assessable value has not kept pace with the increase in the cost of con-instruction.Sub-section (3) of Section 234 of the Public Health Act 1675, which it is&apos; also proposed to repeal, precludes the Minister of Health from sanctioning any loan without local inquiry if the outstanding loan&amp; exceed one yearTs assessable value..    This provision involves expense and delay and serves no useful purpose. If, on merits, a local inquiry is desirable, I have full power to direct that a local inquiry shall be held before deciding whether a loan should or should not be sanctioned.S^k&apos;l^?Jiii:r&apos;i&apos;Li-5l enables a Local Authority to appropriate, with the consent of the Minister, the unexpended balance of a loan fcr other capital purposes.    As the law stands at present, they would have to devote the money to paying off
l44some other loan, and if they required the money for capital expenditure of another kind would havo to raise a fresh loan, . almost certainly at a much enhanced rate of interest.Sub ^section .(5 j,. enables schemes to be made for extending the period for the discharge of loans contracted by Local Authorities, where sinking funds have had to be suspended owing to circumstances arising out of the war, e.g,, in the caso of East Coast Towns.Sub-section (6) substitutes the simple sanction of the Minister in certain cases for the more elaborate procedure of a provisional order confirmed by Parliament.Clause 1W enables the Medical Officer o  Health of a ^ort Sanitary Authority to undertake duties in connection with the medical inspection of aliens.Clause      enables Local Authorities for a period of 5 years to lend or lease premises belonging to them to Govern-ment Departments or other Local Authorities.    This clause is designed to give legal sanction to the action of Local Authorities who have lent or are prepared to lend their buildings to the Ministry of Pensions for hospital purposes.. Clause *gl enables Local Authorities to provide accommo-dation for post mortem examinations in the. same buildings as a mortuary.    They,are forbidden to do so by the present law for reasons which are not very apparent, and the prohibition is the cause of much unnecessary expense.Clause^S5f effects a simplification of the method by which the wards and the numbor of councillors of iitunicipal Corporations may be altered.    The present machinery for the purpose is very elaborate and expensive and it is believed that the Municipal Corporations generally will welcome the change.C ADDISON.Ministry of Health. 9. 7. 1920.
