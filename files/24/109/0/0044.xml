This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.POST OFFICE AND TELEGRAPH BILL.. MEMOKANDUM BY THE SECRETAEY OF STATE FOR WAR.I desire to call the attention of the Cabinet to Clause 4 of the above Bill, which was considered and approved by the Home Affairs Committee at their 67th Meeting.The effect of this clause is to deprive the Navy and Army of a concession which has existed for 125 years, and which they have come to regard as an inalienable constitutional right. It was originally granted by an Act of 1795 (35 George III, Cap. 53), which provided that &quot; whereas it is expedient that the non-commissioned officers, seamen and privates employed in His Majesty&apos;s Navy, Army, Militia, &amp;c, should, whilst on service, be permitted to send and receive single letters by the post, on their own private concerns, at a low rate of postage,&quot; such non-commissioned officers, seamen and privates should be allowed to send and receive letters, if franked by a Commanding Officer or addressed direct to them at their station, at the rate of Id No limitation of weight was imposed, and the privilege was available both for inland correspondence and for correspondence between the British Isles and places beyond the sea.The Post Office (Duties) Act of 1840 imposed a limit of \ oz. on the weight of privileged letters, and authorized a general Id. rate for. letters not exceeding j oz. in weight transmitted by post between places within the United Kingdom. The effect of this Act was to remove all privilege in respect of inland letters.The operation of the privilege so far as letters sent to or received from overseas were concerned fell into desuetude owing to the introduction of the Imperial Penny Postage. The Act at present in existence (the Post Office Act of 1908) grants to the-privileged persons, whether serving at home or abroad, the right of sending or receiving letters not exceeding ^ oz. in weight by post between the British Isles and places beyond the sea at a postage of 1 d. for each letter. The raising of the postal rates beyond Id. has again given the privilege a value, and it is this moment that is chosen for proposing its abolition.The Admiralty and War Office representatives who attended at the meeting of the Home Affairs Committee entered a strong protest against the withdrawal of this time-honoured privilege, but the Committee, owing to administrative difficulties and in view of the present high rates of Army and Navy pay, eventually decided by a narrow majority in favour of the Postmaster-General&apos;s proposal.I venture to hope, however, that the,Cabinet will reconsider the matter and agree to the amendment or omission of Clause 4 of the Bill during the passage through Parliament-It is especially for the troops abroad that the continuance of the concession is desired. It is important that they should not be given cause for discontent by the unnecessary withdrawal of this right which has been for so long specially secured to them by Statute.w.  aThe War Office,   . t 16th July, 1920.
