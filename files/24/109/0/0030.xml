Sir/. July 13, 19 0.I had tho honour of receiving at noon your letter of to-day1 s date relating to   an incident which occurred last night at Spa and of which I,, like yourself, was informed in the course of the morning.-I immediately instituted an enquiry, which lias not yet been completed, but from which it already appears to result that the perr son who struck Mr, Stocklossa, the representative of Wolffs Agency, with a stick was not the Belgian officer who has been accused, but a civilian whose identity lias not yet been established.   The action of tho officer is said to have been restricted to the forcible ejection of Mr. Stocklossa from the terrace of a cafe where he was about to take a seat, and it was thereupon that the civilian is said to have struck him.However that may be,&apos;I have no need to await the termination of the enquiry which has been instituted in order&apos;to tell you that I deplore such displays of violence, which cannot be justified even&apos; by the fact that the war and the German occupation are still fresh in men1s memories.The Minister for foreign Affairs, whom I have informed of the matter, also instructs me to express his regret with regard to this occurrence, the more so as, -according to what you have told me, a member of your Delegation was concerned.I beg to thank you for having tai:en the measures which you enumerate, in order to prevent German delegates and other German   , subjects who have come to Spa for the Conference from visiting cafes and other public resorts.   I would like to say that this suggestion is particularly timely with regard to the late hours of the night. &apos;I feel convinced that thanks to this and to the fresh instructions given to the police end gendarmerie, of whom there are&apos; now a great number in Spa, the recurrence of such incidents Will be rendered impossible. -I have the honour to bo, etc.,. (Signed)    -R01IH JAEQUSMYHS,Secretary-General of theSpa Conference. -Jo His Excellency Dr. Simons, ,German Minister for Foreign Affairs, SPA. -
