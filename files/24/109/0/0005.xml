1 !    This document is the property of His Britannic Majestys Government.* 1Nap-^SECRET. 1 37 /- -604     Y,\\ THE CABINET.REVIEW OF DEFENCE OF  THE REALM REGULATIONS.I circulate to my colleagues a memorandum by the Under Secretary of State for War on the suspension of regulations under the Defence of the Realm Act.W.S.C.The War Office,12th July, 1920.MEMOEANDUM BY THE UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.1. In the latter part of 1918 an Inter-Departmental Committtee was set up under the Chairmanship of the late Secretary of the War Office (Sir R. Brade) to consider the question of the suspension of those regulations under the Defence of the Realm Act and of the orders made under those regulations which the Departments concerned were of opinion were no longer necessary in the national interest. As a result a number of regulations were recommended for cancellation or suspension. A Committee of the War Cabinet, under Lord Cave, in adopting the recommendations of the Inter-Departmental Committee, stated &quot;it is probable that when the terms of the Armistice have been carried out it will be possible to dispense with other Regulations &quot; (G.T. 6350). Since then a certain number of the regulations have been revoked, but there has been no extensive cancellation of regulations although it has become clear that some of those which still remain in force are no longer required.2. The policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government has been to dispense with emergency enactments and regulations as soon as the need for them.has passed, and during the discussions on the War Emergency Laws (Continuance) Bill it was stated on behalf of the Government that Defence of the Realm Regulations and Orders made thereunder would not be retained any longer than was necessary.Questions as to why so many regulations have been unnecessarily retained are therefore liable to be raised in Parliament at any time, for instance, in the course of the discussions on the Indemnity Bill and on the Amending Bill to the Official Secrets Act.3. In these circumstances an Inter-Departmental Conference, to which all Departments interested were asked to send representatives, was recently held at the War Office to consider which of the existing Defence of the Realm Regulations could with safety be revoked. The recommendations of the Conference are given in the appended Schedules.Schedule I. contains regulations recommended for immediate revocation; Schedule II. those which are recommended for immediate revocation as far as Great Britain is concerned but not as regards Ireland; Schedule III. regulations which, although not immediately required by any Department (except the Irish Office in the case of the specified regulations), might be valuable in case of emergency; and Schedule IV. the regulations the retention of which is required, independently of emergencies, by one or more departments.4. I desire to submit the following observations on the recommendations of the Inter-Departmental Conference: (i.) It has been urged that to cancel some of the regulations may lead to increased criticism of those which it is thought necessary to retain, and that, as the agitation against the Defence of the Realm Acts is more or less quiescent at present, it may be the wiser course not to revoke the regulations in Schedules I. and II., but to leave them to expire in the ordinary course On the legal termination of the war, or, as regards Ireland, twelve months later ; but taking all the circumstances into consideration, I am of opinion that the balance of advantage lies in adhering to the declared policy of cancelling emergency regulations as soon as they cease to be required in the public interest.(B20/291)   100  7/20  h&amp;S  8327wo
(ii.) Regulation 27 is in a somewhat special position. The Home Office view is that this regulation which prohibits the spreading of false reports, &amp;c.  is one of those which might be useful in case of emergency, but that it is difficult to defend its retention if any considerable revocation of other regulations takes place ; the Treasury desire to retain Section (d) of this regulation relating to public confidence in bank and currency notes; and the War Office the remaining sections until the end of the war; * its retention in Ireland is considered in any case essential, so that it could only be revoked as regards Great Britain.In all the circumstances I think it advisable to retain this regulation as it stamds.(iii.) Regulation 27a (which relates to reports of Secret Sessions of Parliament or Cabinet meetings, and to the publishing of confidential information) is not required by any Department, and it has been ascertained that the Lord Chancellor and the Speaker see no objection to its immediate revocation. If, as presumed, it is not considered necessary to retain it from the point of view of Cabinet meetings it may be revoked forthwith.(iv.) The regulations in Schedule III. are not required by any Department (except the Irish Office) at present, but it is understood that they would be likely to be required in an emergency, e.g., in case of a general strike. In view of the policy of the Government for dealing with an emergency, the Conference have not suggested the revocation of any of the regulations in this Schedule.(v.) The Conference considered whether it was advisable to revoke any of the regulations scheduled in the Second Schedule of the War Emergency Laws (Continuance) Act, 1920, for continuance, subject to the limitations therein laid down, up to 31st August next, but as each of these regulations in its modified form was reported as essential by one or more of the Departments represented, it was decided to recommend that all of them should be retained.(vi.) The application of the regulations to Ireland is a matter for separate consideration. Under Sub-section 4 of Section 2 of the War Emergency Laws (Continuance) Act, 1920; all the regulations (subject to the limitations laid down for some of them in the Second Schedule to that Act) are to continue in force in Ireland until twelve months after the termination of the war, but a certain number of them are of no value to the Irish Government; these regulations, which are included in Schedule I., are recommended for immediate revocation ; there are other regulations specified in Schedule II. which are required in Ireland but not in Great Britain and these are recommended for revocation in Great Britain only,5. On a review of all the circumstances, I am of opinion that the Cabinet should adhere to the policy. of dispensing with Emergency Regulations which are no longer necessary in the national interest and I consider that the regulations specified in Schedule I. should be immediately revoked and those in Schedule II. immediately revoked except as regards Ireland, while those detailed in Schedules III. and IV. should be retained, and I recommend this course for the approval of the Cabinet.   -Peel.The War Office,10th July, 1920.Schedule I.Regulations recommended for immediate cancellation 2 A A A, 2 D, 2 E E, 2 K, 5 B, 7 B B, 7 B 0, 8 0, 8 C 0, 8 G, 9 G G, 12 A, 13 A, 14 A, 27 A, 30 B B, 30 C, 35 A A, 37 C, 39 A, 39 C C C, 3!)
