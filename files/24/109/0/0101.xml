Qo,pg698. &apos;   \0 A 3 I HE TaTEMPSRAflOE (SCOTLAND) ACT, 1913. Memorandum by the Secretary for Scotland.1. The local veto provisions of the Temperance (Scotland)Act, 1913, come into operation this year, and it is probable that in autumn polls under the Act will be hold in many districts throughout Scotland.2. The three options under the Act are (1) &quot;Ho change&quot;resolution, which means that the powers of the licensing court of the area with regard to the grant or refusal of licences remain unchanged;   (2) &quot;limiting&quot; resolution, which means that the licensing court of the area must reduce the number of licences by one-quarter;   and (3) &quot;No-licence&quot; resolution, which means that no licence shall be granted in the area, subject to certain savings for hotel and restaurant licences.3. The Act as it stands affects only premises licensedunder the Licensing (Scotland) Act, 1903, for the sale ox exciseable liquors, and does not apply to premises owned by the Central Control Board (liquor Traffic) although these premises are used for the. sale of exciseable liquors.4. It has been represented to me by questions in theHouse and by an influential deputation which I recently received in Edinburgh, that the Government should ta^e any necessary steps to bring the Central Control Board&apos;s premises withm the operation of the Act, and should., without delay, announce that this is to be their policy.   In this connoction I may add that the Central Control Beard have recently resolved that, though their premises do not appear to be legally vbound by the effects of any resolution under the Act, they nhtfMd nevertheless, be ready to comply with the terms of any such resolution.5. The matter has been considered at my instance by aconference of officials representing the Central Control Board, the Treasury, the Ministry of Munitions, the Admiralty, and my own Deyartment.   The conference has recommended a  a general proposition, and subject to the considerations mentioned in the three succeeding paragraphs, thst, as regards the premises in question, the Government should undertake that the Central Control Board will give effect to &quot;limiting&quot; or &quot;no-licence&quot; resolutions carried in any area in which such premises exist.6. As regards a &quot;no-licence&quot; resolution, this coursewould seem to present no legal difficulty.   A simple declaration made before the date for requisitions and polls under the Act that the Central Control Board would bive effect to such a resolution would probably suffice?   A question may, no doubt, arise as to the relative ^authority

Memorandum by the Seoretary for Scotland,1. The local veto provisions of the Temperance (Scotland)Act, 1913, come into operation this year, and it is probable that in autumn polls under the Act will be hold in many districts throughout Scotland.2. The three options under the Act are (1) &quot;Ho change&quot;resolution, which means that the powers of tho licensing court of the area with regard to the grant or refusal of licences remain unchanged;   (2) &quot;limiting&quot; resolution, which means that the licensing court of the area must reduce the number of licences by one-quarter;   and (3) &quot;No-lie once&quot; resolution, which moans that no licence shall be;granted in the area, subject to certain savings for hotel and restaurant licences.3. The Act ss it stands affects only premises licensedunder the Licensing (Scotland) Act, 1903, for the sale of exciseable liquors, and does not apply to premises owned by the Central Control Board (Liquor Traffic) although these premises are used for the sale of exciseable liquors,4. It has been represented-to me by questions in theHouse and by an influential deputation which I recently received in Edinburgh, that the Government should ta^e any necessary steps to bring the Central Control Board&apos;s premises within the operation of the Act, and should., without delay, announce that this is to be their policy.   In this connection I may add that the Central Control Board have recently resolved that, though their premises do not appear to be legally vbound by the effects of any resolution under the Act, they 8h?Md nevertheless, be ready to comply with the terms of any such resolution.5. The matter has been considered at my instance by aconference of officials representing the Central Control Board, the Treasury, the Ministry of Munitions, the Admiralty, and my own Department.   The conference has recommended a  a general proposition, and subject- to the considerations mentioned in the throe succeeding paragraphs, thet, as. regards the premises in question, the Government should undertake that the Central Control Board will give effect to &quot;limiting&quot; or &quot;no-licence&quot; resolutions carried in any area in which such premises exist.   .6. As regards a &quot;no-licence&quot; resolution, this coursewould seem to present no legal difficulty.   A simple declaration made before the date for requisitions and polls under the Aot that the Central Control Board would blve effect to suoh a resolution would probably suffice *   A question may, no doubt, arise as to the relative ,authority
of the Board and of the licensing court in regard to the discretion which the Act confers upon licensing courts in the matter of hotel and restaurant licences in a &quot;no-licence&quot; area.7. Legislation might, however, be necessary iffull effect is to he given to tha undertaking so far as &quot;limiting&quot; resolutions are concerned.    Under the Act and regulations the &quot;limiting&quot; optioa can he put on^y in areas which contain two or more licensed promises.     As the premises of the Central Control Board are not licensed&apos; premises, it seems very doubtful if the &quot;limiting&quot; option could competently be put to the vote in areas in which the Board have a monopoly. The need for legislation would be strengthened if there Were in any area both licensed premises and premises belonging to the Board, but on the information before me it would seem that this case does not arise, except in one area in which there is a single licence.8. The terms of the proposed undertaking, viz.,that the Central Control Board should give effect to resolutions, would retain in the hands of the Board the right to select which of their premises should he closed as a result of a &quot;limiting&quot; resolution, and the discration as to hotel and restaurant premises in the case of a &quot;no-licence&quot; resolution, both of which matters are, in the normal case, for the licensing court of the area to decide.   I realise that this oourso may present Parliamentary difficulties, and some modification, e.g. , consultstion with the licensing courts, may have to be conceded.9. The question of policy involved being one ofimportance s:nd urgency, I desire that I should be authorised by my colleagues to mane onfWrly date an announcement on the lines set forth in paragiaph   5, and to have prepared and introduced such legislation as may be necessary to give effect to the policy underlying the announcement.ROBERT MUBRO.SCOTTISH OFFICE.23th July, 1920.
