Instead of fixed Government grants varying in amount tho Treasury aooopted the general principle that in future the oost of maintaining the schools should be equally divided between the State and looal authorities.    The now scheme is .80 arranged that the looal authorities should pay a fixed uniform rate for every child committed, but that the Government Grant should be based on the aotual cost cf maintaining the sohool up to an amount approved by tho Home Offioe.There are a few provisions of the Children Act which require amendment in connection with the new financial scheme.   For instanoo Seotion 73 provides that the Government contribution shall not exceed   2/- per head per wook for children committed to an Industrial School en tho application of their parents er guardians and on proof that they are beyond their control.   The amount fixed is now inappropriate, and there is n$ longer any sufficient reason for treating such cases differently from others.    It is therefore pr^pesed to repeal this provision and also the provision of Seotion 74 (5) paragraph (a), which limits the obligation of  ooal authorities with respect to the mainton-anoe of such ohildren*    As a safeguard against unnecessary applications in guoh cases it is prepesod to require the concurrence of the Looal Eduoation Authcrity by inserting suitable words in Seotion 68.It is proposed to toke this opportunity of amending Section 56 in order to facilitate the superannuation of Officers of the schools.   A scheme has been started under whioh pensions are provided by the purchase of annuities from an Insurance Company - the premiums being paid for partly by the Managers^ of the sojiool and partly by the Officers themselves.    The sohome,. however &apos;i,s defective in several rospeots owing to, the limitation imposed by Section 56.It is also desirable to insert a provision in tho Aot t* secure some hold over buildings whioh are provided out of State and Local funds.    Most of the sohools are voluntary schools under the control of looal Managers and if a school is closed on the ground of ineffioienoy er for any other reason there is nothing to prevent a building provided from public funds being devoted to other purposes.    It is proposed therefore to insert at the end
of Seotion 73 a provision which is founded on Section 17 of the PubXio Libraries Act, 1892.There are^ minor amendments in sections 75 and 76.The Treasury and Scottish Office concur in the terms of the Bill and I have ascertained from the Association of Loool Eduoation Committees that Eduoation Authorities aro not likely to raise any objeotlon to it*As the Bill is unoontroversial I should be glad to have authority to proceed with it at once.St S.13th July, 1920.7G166-7.
