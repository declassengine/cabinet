The existing Early Closing Orders have been in foroe since October, 1916. but in the absence of legislation they will come to an end.on the 31st August or at the termination of the War, whiohever date is, the later.The Early Closing arrangements which have now been in foroe far nearly four years command the general approval of shopkeepers and assistants.,.Such opposition as existed at first has largely died away, as experience has    &quot; brought home the advantages of early closing, and many representations have been sent to the Home Offioe by shopkeepers1 Associations and by individual shopkeepers asking for the continuance of the system.   It had been hoped that general legislation amending the existing Shops Acts and giving a permanent form to the arrangements under the Early Closing Order would be carried this Session.   A Private Member&apos;s Bill was introduced for this purpose with the approval of the Home Offioe, but after passing successfully through Committee it was amended in such a way on Report as to make it unworkable, and I am unable t$ recommend that any facilities should be given it by the Government. There is now. therefore, no hope of the matter being dealt with by general legislation this year.   It would, however, b? most unfortunate if the existing Regulations came to an end before an amending Shops Bill is carried through. Intense disappointment would be caused among the shopkeeping olasses through-out the country, and the Government would incur a good deal of unpopularity. Accordingly, it is proposed by the present Bill to continue the existing regulations fcr a time with a view to the further consideration of the subjeot next year.If the Bill is to be of any use, it must become law before Parliament adjourns for the summer vaoation.9th July, 1920.E.

local authorities in england and wales ;    report.31Poor-law ofilters.114. The position of poor-law officers is very different from that of the police. In general there appears now to be nothing in the conditions of the poor-law service which need differentiate the persons employed in it from persons employed in, e.g., the public health service.. Employment in institutions is a common feature of both services. And, outside London and other great centres of&apos; population, the administrative and clerical, work of the poor-law authorities and of the&apos; public health authorities (especially the rural district councils) is often carried on in. the same building, sometimes by different stalls working side by side, and sometimes by the same individuals serving both the poor-law authorities and the public health authorities. The pension benefits under the Poor Law Officers&apos; Superannuation Act, 1896, also resemble closely those which we recommend.115. The defects of the scheme established, by the-Poor Law Officers&apos; Superannuation Act, 1896, as set out in evidence tendered to us on behalf of the Association of Poor Law Unions are as follows : -&quot;The worst defect, and one which badly needs removing, is that while contributions are retained by whatever Boards: employ the officer from time to time, the superan-nuation is payable by the Board he or she last serves. The result is that Boards do not care to appoint an officer with several years&apos; service, and such a one finds it difficult or impossible to get promotion, while the Guardians, through fear of adding a burden to their own rates in a few years&apos; time, avail themselves less than they might of the experience gained by officers of long standing and the system is therefore bad for both officers and. Guardians.&quot; When contributions are returnable, the Board under whom the officer last serves must not only hand back the sums received by them, but also those paid to other Boards under whom the officer previously served.&quot; Officers who die before superannuation age get no return for their contributions, and -the hardship thus caused has led to the Guardians in many cases voting gratuities for the deceased officers&apos; extraordinary services equal to the amount of the contributions, but this method of repayment is neither satisfactory nor straightforward. Besides it is subject to the sanction of the Central Department, and the Department while generally sympathising does not always give the desired sanction.&quot;It is often difficult to decide whether an officer can claim the return of contributions on account of illness or not.&quot; An officers contributions and superannuation are reckoned on the salary paid, him by the Guardians; when he employs assistants whom he pays himself his net salary towards the close of his career may be less than the superannuation he will receive and he may thus get more after retirement than when doing his work.&quot;In the scheme which we have recommended we have tried to avoid these defects by providing for a system of &quot; transfer values &quot; to operate when an officer is transferred from one authority to another (paragraph 92), for a return of the officers&apos; contributions in certain specified events (paragraph 42), and for a proper definition of pensionable salary or wages (paragraph 46). The provision for a return of contributions willalso remove the objections to the, in elusion of nurses in a compulsory scheme (see paragraph 15).   -It is true that the contributions under the Act of. 1896 are less than those which we recommend ; but these rates have proved altogether inadequate, as we have shown above in paragraphs 53 and 54. .;116. We should, therefore, have been disposed to recommend that the poor-law scheme should, with due regard to existing rights, be merged in the proposed scheme had this not been rendered unnecessary by the decision of the Government to adopt the Report of the Local Government Committee of the Ministry of Reconstruction on the Transfer of Functions of Poor Law Authorities in England and Wales (Cd. 8917) which recommended the abolition of the board of guardians and of the poor-law union and the merging, subject to certain necessary modifications, of all the functions of the poor-law authorities, in those of the councils of counties, county boroughs, and other boroughs and urban districts having a population of over 50,000.- As soon as the contemplated transfer of functions is accomplished^the separate poor-law service will cease to exist and the only question which will remain is how the existing poor-law officers should, be treated. The Report of the above-mentioned Local Government Committee recommended that--&quot; all rights of superannuation of existing officers who are transferred.....should be fully protected.&quot;We concur in this recommendation and consider that the power and the liability, to pension these officers should be transferred along with other existing powers and liabilities to the appropriate new authorities, which would continue to receive the officers&apos; contributions on the old scale and to pay them their pensions, when due, out of the rates, as the employing poor-law authority would have done. We think, however, that all existing poor-law officers should have the option, to be exercised within a period of six months, to transfer to the new
