THE SITUATION Police.kr wYLIE (Law Adviser) said that in his view the presentposition in Ireland meant the parting of the ways, and onlyharm could come Qi -patchwork legislation,    with regard to thostate of the i-olice, he had during the last three weeks seena large number of police officers, and had formed the strongopinion that within two months the Irish police porce as ai-olice [Force would oease to exist.     He was referring now tothe whole of Ireland, with the exception of the-Forth-SastCounties..   In two months1 time, fifty per cent, of thePolio o: ?orce would have resigned through terrorism, andthe remainder would have to go about in considerable forcecommitting counter outrages.     Am Irish policeman either sawwhite or he saw red; if he saw white, he resigned fromthe H&apos;orce through terrorism, and if ho&apos; saw red he committeda counter oJfcrage.   Both conditions of mind were disastrous.&quot;,/ith regard to the Civil Courts, the entire administra-tion of the Imperial Government had .ceased.     In one town,out of 45 appeals down for hearing only two came on.     as for the revenue, everyone was determined to pay no taxes, andit was not fair to ask the revenue officers to collect them,for, if they att^im^ed to do. so, they did it at tho peril oftheir lives. ... .).With regard to the Local Authorities, these were preparedto function so far as their own local affairs were/concerned,but they would give no assistance in.carrying out the:.instructions of the Irish Government.remedies. There were in his opinion two remedies  or the present(l) nartialLaw.      state of affairs.   The first was to proclaim at once martial law ef the most stringent kind,   as an Irishman, this to him was abhorrent.--t. ;ancl- afforded no solution of tho problem.Civil Courts.LocalAuthorities
By proclaiming.martial law it would be possible tobeat&apos; the-people, into insensibility; but when martiallavv was taken off *.,ancV it must end some time - thofeelings of hatred ind bitterness would be intensified,and thero would be a return to the. present state of-affairs.The second remedy was a. settlement with Sinn lein.   He was aware that the English might regard this as a condonation ofthe murderers, but he wished to emphasize that these murder-ers were not real criminals.   Of that he felt convince1..1&apos;anatics thoy might be, and probably were, but they were themselves convinced that through murder was the only pathto; freedom.   These men, were not committing outrages through -blood-lust, but because they believed they had been trickedby the British Government, and the only way to focus the eyes of Europe on&apos;their cause was by the adoption of the methodsthey had pursued.   The Sinn Eeiners,were of the opinion thatthe application of martial law would assist their cause.negotiations A difficulty in regard to settling with. Sinn Pein wasa Sinnto find anyone with whom .to negotiate.   He felt convinced that if England took her courage in both hands and stated that she was prepared to -settle with Sinn l-ein on any terms short of an Irish Republic, and that if Sinn Fein did-not accept the&quot;offir: martial law would be introduced, Sinn Pein would come forward and negotiate.     The Sinn Feinors were convinced that they were capable cf governing Ireland, and he agreed&apos;with them.  &quot;He himself had started life as a Unionist, but now, after seeing the marvellous organisation which Sinn Pein had built up, he was of the opinion that the Irish were capable of governing themselves.   If the Government attempted to bludgeon the Irish.people, no good could possibly -result, and Ireland would&quot; still remain a thorn in the side of the Empire.     But if the Government played straight, within two years Ireland would be one pi the strongest . partners/within the ,Em;.;ire,
1ri.&quot;hen the now administration had. come over to Ireland, for si:;. weeks there had he en a lull in the bi.an loin tactics of mui d er and outrage. .   This was caused, by the hope that England would come forward and say. that they were prepared to meet Sinn fein.     After six weeks this hope disappeared, and during the last fortnight things had become worse than they had ever been before.     He would like it to be realised that the British Government was up against a national movement, and that if-anything was to be done it must be done now. Ulster. In answer to a Question as to whether he thought Sinn jj-cinwould accept County Option, hjc V/ylio replied that he was certain Sinn j/ein - would: accept County Option for Ulster, and they might even go so far as to consent t&amp; the six -uountios remaining cut.Mr &quot;;ylio was also asked what powers Sinn join wanted that wore not given them by the present Bill, and ho replied that they wanted everything except defence.     They were perfectly willing that defence should bo under the Imperial IVarliamertt and that the Imperial Parliament should have control of tho ports.Sinn 1&apos;ein In reply to a further question as to whether the SinnandOutrages. Poiners ho had met were responsible for planning the assassin-ations, hx .ylio said that they undoubtedly knew about them, but thought that they helped, their cause. . At the present moment tho Sinn i-oi-ners he had. met hold that the&apos; could not stop the outrages so long.as the British Government continued its present policy.   But he thought that, given a&apos;proper atmosphere, they would be able to put down tho extro-aists,lolice GI^lTniil. TO DOB said that he feared that -the Koyal irish constabulary could not last march longer, as they did not consider that they were being properly supported.     -is a j;olice Worce, he agreed with fir ,/ylio, within a few months they would cease to function; but as a military body he thought they might have great effect.     He had. just recruited 500 er-officers
and a number of ax-soldiers, which formed a fine body of men,and he felt that, given the proper support, it would bepossible to crush the present campaign of outrage.    Askedfor his suggestions as to the measures to be adopted, GENERALTUDOR outlined them as follows(1) No tribunal to function except as a Court-martial.(2) A Court-martial to be the tribunal for all crimes.(3) The establishment of identity cards, in all towns in Ireland, as had been done by the Army of Occupation in Germany.(4) That passports should be necessary for entry into Ireland.   (He believed this would have a great effect on the activ-ities of the I.R.B.)(5) Power to restrict change of domicile.(6) The proclaiming of certain areas as military areas, so that if a murder had been committed in a certain district a fine could be imposed on that district, and, if there was a refusal to pay, this could be met by seizing the cattle and stock of the residents sufficient to make ^cj) the amount of the fine.(7)Thai ihere should be a special penalty of flijgging imposed for the cutting of gir&apos;ls* hair&apos; and outrages against women.(8)Thai ail prisoners should be sent to this cnuiitry, as the hard labour imposed in England and Scotland was more severe than in Ireland, and, further, the pris6ners would not be in touch with the outside world. &apos;,](9)^hat steps should be taken to have the Post Office purged of traitors.   (At the present moment it was difficult to administer the Police owing to the dif- . ficulty of getting orders round to them. ,(10)That Cardinal Mannix should not be allowed to land in Ireland.GENERAL TUDOR was asked if the adoption of his suggestions would give the Police a feeling that they were being supported.      GENERAL TUDOR replied in the affirmative, and said that the two things which had given the Police a feeling of insecurity were (1) ib&amp; release of the hunger-strikers, and (2) the fact that not a single criminal had been brought to justice for morcler.
4 5 0Arohblaljop Mannix..Iffaae of jimerick.-dice.fith regard to the landing of Cardinal Mannfx,. the Conference, decided that the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs shouloV send a telegram to the British      : Mbassador at Washington, requesting . him to. warn Cardinal Mannix before he 1^.  sailed that he would not &quot;be allowed to land in Ireland.GEH3RA1 TUDOR, continuing, said that he did not agree withMr Wylie that all the murderers were fanatics-;    Some of themundoubtedly were, but there were a number of loafers and ex-*soldiers who were very highly paid for committing murders.TEE PRIME MINISTER asked if, with powers of the kind he&apos; had intimated, GENERAL TUDOR could control the situation.GENERAL TUDOR said that lie thought he could, provided that-enough men Were, obtainable.   The whole country was intinid-ated,. and would thank G&apos;od for strong measures.     If the country was handed over to Sinn Fein, he doubted whether they could cd ntrol the extremists, and he was not at all sure that  . the Sinn Peiners could put an end to the activities of the Gunmen.A reference was then made&apos; to the satisfactory manner in which, disorders in the city of limerick had been dealt with,  . and it was stated.that this was&apos;owing to the adoption of different methods.GENERAL TUDOR said that this was true, and the method adopted was that the Police went out on patrol   and if a street uas empty they fired down it and they also held up, hungers at street corners and had them roughly searched. These methods had the effect of-reducing the city to quiet.GENERAL KACREADY added that it was also because there was a first-rate man as District Inspector in Limerick.GENERAl Tudor was asked what he. meant when he said that his measures might suecedd. provided ho got enougl &apos;l men; and he replied that, at the present moment, the recruitment of * the Royal Irish Constabulary was only keeping pace withx
the Royal Irish Constabulary was only keeping pace, with resignations.     IT it was impossible to get fehe men, he must develop the Idea of temporary cadet officers, ,500 of whom he had obtained.    These off leers were drafted from England to strengthen the Royal Irish Constabulary personnel in certain pasts of the country and had had a great effect.MR COtE (Assistant Undersecretary) asked for his views on the situation said he had seen Cardinal Logue, who thought that a solution of the problem might be found by the granting of Dominion Home Rule.    The Cardinal placed the responsibility for the murders at the door of the British Government.   With regard to these murders, Mr Cope  aid he thought that the Sinn Fein Court s were doing more harm to the prestige of the British Government than the assassinations.     The Sinn Fein Courts were working very efficiently, but it must be remembered that the amount of -ordinary crime in Ireland was very small. There were only 450 prisoners in the country when they had accommodation for 6,000.    Eliminating offences against the Police, there was practically no crime in Iceland at all. The Sinn Peiners were working hard at increasing the efficiency of their Courts.    !7ith regard to General Tudorrs scheme for the putting down of murder, he dub ted whether it wouid be effective, and felt that any suppression now would oome--&apos;back^.like.. o.^bojoxiBrang&apos;&quot;onixie. Government.
SIR from iilJDEBSON (Joint Under Secretary) said that he agreed entirely with Mr Wyliers general proposition, and with    &apos; Police.     General Tudor    up to a point.      If a sufficient force could .&quot;be obtained there was no doubt it would be possible to reduce . the country, to order, but he did not think that the Royal Irish Constabulary as it existed today would be a very important factor in bringing about that result. . If force was resorted to, the Royal Irish Constabulary would cease to exist, and in place of it a new force would arise, containing perhaps a certain ;-. . number of old Eoyal Irish Constabulary men, but to all intents and purposes a new force, which, would not deal with the ordinary crimes of the country.     He could not help thinking that General Tudor, in stating that under certain conditions he could restore order, must have been assuming the assistance of a larger military force.     The case of Limerick had been cited as an example of what might be done, but in his opinion Limerick was an isolated case due to an exceptional personality &apos; and it would not be safe to assume that it was possible to restore order In the same way every/There.     The measures which General Tudor advocated were those of martial law, and, were not the artial    ordinary methods of administering civil government.     TheCivil Administration under martial law would either be driven&apos;; to/seek the protection of the military, or would cease -to  unction altogether.     Under martial law there must be one military administrator who would have the whole power in his hands, and the civil authorities would be subordinate. He himself doubted whether it &quot;would be possible to restore &apos; order or maintain a sufficiently forcible policy.     The Government was up against a well-organised body, and to
restore order would be a very lengthy business, which he ventured to think could not&quot;be done in the time at their disposal.    He agreed with what Mr Wylie had said., that when the time came to take off martial law there would be no material left-with which to work for a solution of the Irish Problem.THE  RIMS MINISTER said that Mr Wylie had mentioned that a certain atmosphere was necessary before a settlement could be reached.      He would like to know if such Inconveniences as had been suggested by General .Tu&amp;or- would., or eat e the desired atmosphere.
replied that suoh a course of action would only create a feeling of intense hostility inIreland, and the Irish would regard It as another piece of English tyranny; the result would be that more andmore the loyalists would tend to go over to the rebelranks.   Already the complaint of loyalists against the stoppage of race trains had been very bitter.THE PRIilE MINISTER then asked for ari expression ofopinion on the situation from those who had nOt been present at previous meetings., and in particular frm sir james Craig*SIR JAMES CRAIG replied that his own personalexperience made him agree on the whole with what lir.Wyliehad said with regard to the condition of Ireland and thefeoling in that country..   He did net think that there hadbeen sufficient energy in dealing with Sinn Fein*No overhead policy from which ixhe Government would not deviateappeared to exist-.   We were more or less drifting alongon various linos without co-ordination. * He had urged,and did his utmost to get the Irish Home Rule Bill throughthe House of Commons., and had persuaded some of hiscolleagues to drop their opposition to the Bill.   It wouldbe a very dangerous course of policy for the Governmentto pursue if the House of Commons were allowed to risewithout anything being done, and with no declaration ofa definite policy.   It was also essential that the Govern-ment should be very straight..   Pledges had undoubtedly been broken:; for instance there was the case of the Irishsh Education Bill.   He had never, been able to understand why   -cationthis Bill had been introduced contemporaneously with the Home Rule Bill..   It was an over estimate of the possibilities of parliamentary work and the failure to proceed with it
had bo-en regarded&apos; as one more milestone. on -the road       45 .)of broken pledges.   Even the loyalists point -to this bill.as a broken pledge, and ask whether It were possiblenow to rely on the Government carrying out any policy that it announced.   This doubt drove loyalists toSinn Fein.   He had evidence of loyalists getting protection from Sinn Fein, and he instanced a case in which a memberof the House of Commons had applied to Sinn Fein in orderto secure the collection of debts in Cork.   This factshowed that even in England there were people who had come to regard the Sinn Fein organisation-as a- mediumfor commerce.   ;7e had got beyond the time when measures for securing.the running of trains and the protectionof police were of any real value.   The Government shouldmap out now what they intend to do make an announcementof it and stick to their plan^.   By doing this they would tideover a very dangerous period in.the late summer *THE PRIME MINISTER enquired what sort of- an announcement Sir James Craig suggested should be made0SIR JAMES CRAIG replied that the announcement should be largely a re-affirmation of policy. . Ulster should be left out of account.   She. already has separate treatment and a separate Parliament.   So far as the South and West of Ireland were concerned further concessions coul  be made, but such concessions *vould affect finance at once as they would touch on questions relating to the customs and debts due, etc.   rhen such concessions were announced, the North would no doubt want the,same, and it ould be possible to co-operate with the North.which was keen to be carried on in the same way as the United Kingdom.   Ulster could be given more elasticity in fInance*   Some such steps would settle the unrest In
Ulster, and the Irish Bill could fro proceeded aufar as Ulster was concerned.   So far as the SouVh told &quot;&apos;;est Tiere concerned; Sir James Craig said that he could not. make definite proposals unless he were given a few days in which to consult with other persons.   He would then be able to put forward a definite plan.-  He suggested that a small Committee of three or four could with conscientious work elaborate a good plan.   The questions to be considered by the Committee would have the following objects (1)   An extension of the scope of the Home Rule Bill: (2)   .The maintenance of law and order in Ireland: (3)   The Committee would no doubt advise on thequestion as to how far It would Inflame public opinion to stop railv/ays and the administration of the Post Office, etc, and how far the advantages of such a policy would outweigh the disadvantageSo THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS - stated that he had gathered from Sir Jones Craig&apos;s statement that Sir James agreed with MrcWylie!s views, vizc,that repression however effective must break down because it could hot be maintained indefinitely,, and when repression was relaxed the sore would remajn unhealed.   Moreover, there were difficulties with the Police.   It was cn these grounds that Mr,Wylie had advocated the policy of getting into touch with&apos; Sinn Fein and offering them Dominion Home Rule. Did Sir James Craig propose the same policy?8th JAMES CRAIG replied that he had only agreed with Mr.-vylie&apos;s description of the. situation in Ireland, -he did not necessarily agree with his conclusions and he again urged that a small. Committee should be established in order to prepare a comprehensive plan for submission to
the Prime Minister0THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER pointed out that &apos; Sir James Qraig&apos;s plan, so f ar as already expounded, .-would give to the South and West of Ireland Dominion finance- and&apos; Dominion internal administration! hut it &apos; would leave the control of the army and navy to the Imperial Government. - His policy was in fact the same as that suggested by IhWylie, but Mr,Wylie would present it as Dominion Government while Sir James Craig would present it as an amendment to the Home Rule Bill. -If the policy suggested were presented as an amendment to the Home Rule Bill and not as a new and distinct offer of Dominion government, would it be acceptable to Sinn Fein?MR.WYLIE replied in the negative *   He was certain that the Government must make a new departure.   It was essential to remember when deajin^ with Irishmen that an appeal should be made to their iluaginationoSIR JAMES CRAIG pointed out that to make this new departure wouldinvol^e a change of the whole policy of the Government in regard to the Home Rule Bill, such a change would inevitably be regarded as another instance of inconsistency. -
THE PRIME MINISTER said that Mr. Wylier8 view   was the;V&apos; the vast majority of the population of the South and West of Ireland would he prepared to accept Dominion Home Rule, Would the leaders of 6inn Fein he prepared to say so and to meet someone, say in Dublin, who could go into the matter witii them?   Would they be prepared to state openly that they accepted the sovereignty of the British Empire over Ireland and were willing to use their influence to suppress crime?Mr WYLIE replied that the Sinn tfein leaders would not say so publicly, at any rate, before the British Government made their offer.   As soon as a statement was made in the House of Commons, backed by a definite pledge of England&apos;s honour, he thought that the Sinn i%in leaders would be willing to get into toueh with representatives of the British Government and would do their best to work some scheme of Dominion Home Rule;THE LORD PRIVY SEAL remarked that he had been told that certain Unionists in the South of Ireland wished the Government to follow the policy suggested by Air Wylie.   He $sked Mr Wylie whether this was s&apos;o.Mr WYLIE replied that it was so, undoubtedly.THE PREumilT OS THE BOARD 0 i1 EDUCATION enquired whether it would meet the views of binn ^ein if the Prime Minister were to declare that the Hone Rule Bill was -going to be passed and that t::Rre was no intention of altering the arrangements made for the six Counties, but that a Con-vsntion would be summoned, say, next year in the South or West of Ireland to frame a Constitution for that part of Ireland (with the reservation that control of the Army and Navy would be left to Sreat Britain and that the separate arrangements for the six Counties would still stand.Mr WYLIE replied that such an offer would not be .eonsi-der*K
f . . . 459by &quot;Sinn Fein,   Tho ivord&apos;..................the mere existeaoo of reservations In th$ offer would be enough to condemn It. II &apos;   TEE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR asked Sir John Andersonto explain further the situation in Ireland arising from the existing dislocation of the railways and the consequent damage to trade.Railway SIB JOHN ANUE1RS0N replied that it certainly was the casePolicy,that in the last few weeks trade had been severely hampered^The railways were not functioning normally, and in the partswhere disorder had occurred trade had suffered sevoraly*If repressive   measures were taken, great distress wouldresult.   No doubt up to the present moment things had gonesufficiently far to create a desire for an early settlement,and the increasing disorganisation of trade had to that extent had a beneficial effect on public opinion.   But wewere now at the parting of the ways, and the Governmenthad either to give way or to go very much further inrepression.   If force were to be used, success in its use wasindispensable, and the civil  machine would have te be scrapp-ed.   The alternatives were, in fact, the declaration of martial law or some kind of agreement with Sinn Fein.Position of THE LORD PRIVY SKILL pointed out that there was a differ-Ulster underDominion        enoe of view as to what would happen if the second alterna-Home Rule.tive were adopted.     It had been held that Sinn Fein wouldmake an offer on the part of the British Government simply astepping-stone for further aggrandisement.   Moreover,Mr. J.H.Thomas had informed the Prime Minister that SinnFein would accept.no proposals that involved the exclusion of the Six Counties.MR UYLIE urged that tton Six Counties should be leftunder British control and not be given a separate Parliament.!The view at Sinn Fein was that if left to administer theSouth and V.&apos;est of Ireland, riinn Fein would be so successfulthat the Six Counties would want to come in and not toremain under the British Parliament.- 14 -
v  v 460/THE HRST LOliB OF THE AMTJtALTY asked what would be the effect on opinion in Ulster.SIR JA.MES CRAIG the light the effect would be disastrous. The Government had already gone too far,, and their pledges were too definite.Mr WILIE remarked that Sinn&apos; J&apos;ein pointed to the statement made by the Ulster leaders in the House of Commons to the effect that Ulster wished to be left under England/SIR IOHN AUDERSOU said that some little time ago therewere indications that Sinn Eein would not refuse dominion home Rule with a separate Parliament for Ulster.   The raaj^r-ity, it was true, were opposed to such a separate Parliament,but he believed that a great body of feeling in ireland would be sympathetic.   In any case, some definite action would have to be taken.Arming of THE SECRETARY 01 STATE FOR WAR enquired what Mr. WylieUlster.thought would happen if the Protestants in the Six Counties were given weapons and were definitely charged with the duty of maintaining law and order and of policing the country? The object of such an arrangement would be the withdrawal of the troops from Ulster, and of a considerable number, if not all, the regular police.Mr WYLIE thought that such a pylicy would be disastrous, Sinn Eein would arm a more numerous and an equally efficient force.   In Derry there were a large number of rifles, and every man   had a revolver.   There would be intense civil war, and in other parts, of Ulster, while there would not perhaps &quot;be definite fighting, there would be guerilla warfare and continual assassination.   In Belfast the Protestants would reduce the Catholics to.a state of terror.   In Tyrone there would be an unceasing .and* unending civil war.   He could not conceive that his Ma.majesty&apos;s Government would allow this to take place.
SIB JAMEb OBAIG said that in his opinion suoh a ooarea       j would be quite practicable, if it were legalised.   Special Constables would have to be sworn in and take the oath of allegiance, and they should be allowed to elect their own officers, with control through the Array authorities.   Ulster would&apos;be glad to maintain law and order in the Six Counties, and would be able to do it.   Ulster would hot, he was con-vinced, terrorise the Roman Catholics, and would not allow mob law.   Ulster would be able to prevent the Protestants from running amok.GrEi3HBAX( TUDOR remarked that Ulster was Very anxious to n&amp;Utaxn order in the Six Counties, but did not wish to usa an irregular force for this purpose.   It wanted the Special Constables to be recognised, and did not desire the Ulster Volunteers to be utilised.THE PRHJ1 MINISTER suggested that the proposals now put forward    for the maintenance of law and order in Ulster by Ulstermen should be examined.GENERAL TUDOR thought that a policy of allowing Ulster to maintain order for herself would encourage the loyalists and would *how that the Government did differentiate between rebels and loyalists,THE PRIME MINISTER remarked that he was not thinking of such differentiation, but of releasing troops and police.   If Ulster would police itself, 7 battalions and some 2,000 tJ 3,000 police would be -released for use elsewhere.SIR JOHN ANDERSON remarked that he had discussed with many persons in Ireland a proposal   to use Protestants as police or as an auxiliary force.   He thought that if the policy of force were decided on it would undoubtedly be necessary to, take some such action in the ordinary course of events.&apos; Military efficiency might or might not be increased thereby, but it was certain that the South of Ireland would become ablaze at once.   There would be a massacre of Protestants in the South and West.   To the renjark that the position could not well be worse than it was now, he replied that the isolated murders of Police were not the ...1 tm.lt of possible Sinn Jfein activities.
BIH-^MBSJWACMAHO^ said that, /J g g^in his opinion, any attempt at repression would fail;   and not only would it fail, but it would deprive the Government of any friends amongst the Nationalists whom they might have left.   He was satisfied that- thoso methods would not dispatch  the ruffians, but, on the contrary, would drive into the opposite camp a great number of-people who held moderate opinions.With regard to the two parliaments in Ireland, as suggested under the existing Bill, he felt certain that they would result in more trouble than&apos;at&apos;present.  . In the South there would be no Parliament worthy of the name. , It was true they might take the oath of allegiance, but they would repu-diate the oath in advance and then assume all the functions which tlie Act of Parliament did not give them.   The Southern . Parliament would then become an unlawful assembly and would have to be broken up.   This would be used as propaganda, and it would be said that the Imperial Government only gave Southern Ireland, a Parlljuent in order to take it away again.His suggestion was a Bill extending to the 38 Countiesin Ireland,&apos; with power to any County to vote itself out ifit did not like the provisions of the Bill.   Every Ulsterelector had so far voted against Home Rule, but if there.existed a Parliament in Dublin and it was put to the Ulsterelectors whether they would join% or not, the issue was quite a different one,&apos; end he;thought that those who were of theopinion that the majority of the Six Counties would votethemselves out were mistaken-.   He had discussed this matter with many of hie Orange friends, and they had agreed that&apos;    &apos;     &apos;   , a;   &apos; they would only put up a fight against/Dublin Parliamentif their interests were attacked.With regard to the assassinations, he had been talking toCardinal logue, whom he had found weeping over the murder of Colonel Smythe, which had shocked him beyond measure,and he had denounced the perpetrators.   He had as^ed the cardinal/
Cardinal &quot;if there were no means of even tempera:&quot;:&apos;.^; ltopping the present assassinationsv and he had replied by &amp;f&quot;L:i;g what was the good of attempting the impossible when the Government provided the excuse for these men to commit such outrages?In reply to a -question. Six James MacMahon stated that the Roman Catholic Church had always been opposed to a Republic. Sir James MacMahon was asked, whether the priests gave absolution to murderers, and replied that if the priest knew the facts    * he would not slve absolution, but in a confession a man did not always state that he ha&apos;?, committed a murder, as he did not regard such an act as a crime.SIR JAMES MACMAHON then gave a short history of the Sinn i?ein movement, and stated that, the real Sinn Fein movement was against these acts of violence, which were in reality carried on by a very small section of extremists who attached them-selves for their own purposes to Sinn Fein.Some discussion then followed regarding the administration of certain funds received in Ireland, which it was alleged had been used for the purpose of paying; the murderers *   Sir James MacMahon contended that so far no proof had been produoed to show that the funds were used for the purpose of paying the murderers, or that the persons named organised the gang.Further, Sir James MacMahon contested the statement that thepaid... He contended, on the other hand, that thoy wore mostly assassins were mostly/young political fanatics members ofSecret Societies -ho were forced to commit these murders at theperil of their lives.SIR JAMES MACMAHON&apos; was then asted why, if so .many of theleading lights in the Sinn Fein movement were prepared toaccept Dominion Home Rule, they stated thoy would accept nothingless than a Republic?    Sir James MacMahon replied that theydid this on the principle of a man who wished to sell a horseand stated that he required  100 when in reality he was pre-pared to accept  70.THE PRIME MINISTER/
THE PRIMS. MINISTER said that he would like to know -(1) The price the Government would have to pay:(3) What the Government would got in return:(3) Who would guarantee that the Government would get it?Tho Government wanted peace and order in Ireland, and Sir James MacMahon had said&apos; that this could not be got by coercion. What measure of Home Rulo, then, would produce the desired results?   Ho Sinn Eainer had ever said that he would accept Dominion Home RuleSIR JAMES MACMAHON said that he thought the Sinn Feiners would accept a Home Rule Bill giving- them Customs and Excise, but reserving the Army and Wavy to the Imperial Government. They would be willing to pay a small fixed contribution to the Imperial Exchequer, and agree to County Option.   He thought this would be accepted by the majority, and the Church would accept such a scheme with glee.   The following scheme, he thought they nfight accept, but it would be more difficult:-For the Government to pass a Dominion Home Rule Bill for, the 26 Counties in Ireland,-on the same&quot; terms as he had mentioned above, stipulating fast the Six Counties should remain as they are at present, under the Imperial Government.,THE PRIME MINISTER said that this meant putting financialpressure on the Six Counties&quot;to come in.SIR JAMES MACMAKDH replied that that would mean that Ulster would be willing to sell her rights of remaining under the Imperial Parliament in order to obtain financial advantages.A question was asked, if Dominion Home Rule was given tothe South and they attempted to work the Act, would thegang of assassins dominate the situation in the south, or would the Parliament be able to put taem down, when theImperial Government with ell the enormous, resources at itscommand had failed to do so?-19-
SIR JAMBS MCMAHON replied, that history proved that&apos; it would be possible for the Southern Parliament to put down the gang of assassins..    THE PRIME MINISTER asked what Ireland would.get under Dominion Home Rule which it did not get under tho present Bill?   There was Finance (leaving the Imperial contribution to the Dominion itself), Excise, Customs, Defence.SIR JAMES MACMAHON said that Sinn Fein would be prepared to agree that Defence&apos; should be reserved to the Imperial Parliament.    As regards Finance, he could not say definitely but he had heard the basis of a contribution of  1 per head of the population mmtioned.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE MGHEQUEE said that what Sir James MacMahon suggested was really eompbie fiscal autonomy.., 3eaving to Ireland the power to make any Imperial contribution she thought fit,THE PRIME MINISTER then asked, if all this was given to them and they were told that the Siz Counties were excluded, having, if. they wished, a Parliament cf their own, would such a proposition be acceptable?SIR JAMES MACMAHON replied in the negative.   The contention of the Sinn Feiners was that if the Six Counties remained under the Imperial Parliament there was still a chance of their eventually joining with the Dublin Parliament.   If, on the other hand, the Six Counties had a Parliament of their own, all hops of a union of the whole of Ireland under one Parliament must be given up.2 V/hiichall Gardens, S.W.2.3rd July, 1920. , &apos;-20-
