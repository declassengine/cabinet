31.9THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY Off HIS BRITANNIC-MAJESTYTS&apos;    CABINET. BREAD   SUBSIDY COMMITTEE.Memorandum by tho Ministor of Labour.SECRET.        With reference to CP. 1602 (Report by the ChairmanCP.      of the Bread Subsidy Committee), I circulate herewith a 1668.table which has been prepared in my department to show how Great Britain compares with certain continental countries as regards quantities of bread purchasable with the daily wage at present current In certain typical occupations.   I think my colleagues will be Interested to see it.    The figures for Germany nave &apos; been found to be so unreliable that it has been thought better not to include a comparison in that case.(Intd)   T.J.M.Ministry of labour, 21.7.2C22/7A563.r
The following Tables ere intended to show how Great Britain compares with certain continental countries as regards the quantity of bread purchasable with the daily wage at present current for adult workmen in certain typical occupations.     The local variations to which both the rate of wage in a particular occupation and the retail price of a particular article of food are subject in one and the same country at any given time have made it necessary, in order to ensure the utmost degree of international comparability, to consider for each country the wage-rate- and the bread-price current in the capital only.      There, in the absence of information for the capital, it has been necessary to select some other town, the fact is duly indicated.In tiie case of foreign countries the wages, as well as the bread prices, are shown first in the foreign units of currency and weight.and then (In brackets) In the corresponding English units.     Conversions from foreign currency have been made in each case at the par of exchange, namely       &apos;ITrance Italy Norway Swedene . . ... ...... .......franclirakronekronas 9.6d. s 9.6d. rl3.3d. s!3.3d.The wages shown are in all cases time rates fixed by the most recent agreement known to the Department to have been reached by collective bargaining between employers and workers in the trade.I.     race   01?    *7i*GBS   PER   BAY.TOccult ion.: United Singdom (London)-Prance (Paris)Italy (Rome )Norway (christiania)Sweden (Stockholm)ftcklayers and isons.
