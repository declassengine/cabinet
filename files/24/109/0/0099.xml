This document is the property of His Britannic Majestys Government;;SECRET.GftP, 1 696THE CABINET.SITUATION IN MESOPOTAMIA.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.I circulate herewith for the information of my colleagues a copy of a letter, dated 22nd July, from the War Office to the India Office on the subject of rebellious outbreaks by Arabs in Mesopotamia.W. S. C.The War Office,2Uh July, 1920.121/3/1858 (M.I. 2).X9303 of X9315 of X9349 of X 9356 of X9376 of4.7.2015.7.207.7.207.7.209.7.20X 9387 of 10.7.20 X 9413 of 12.7.20The War Office,Sir, 22nd July, 1920.1. I am commanded by the Army Council to forward, for the information of Mr. Montagu, copies of the marginally-noted telegrams which have been received from the General Officer Commanding, Mesopotamia, relative to the situation on the Lower Euphrates.2. I am to say that the Army Council, in view of this and recent similar outbreaks in Mesopotamia, consider that the time has arrived when they must ask Mr. Montagu whether he is confident that the local policy pursued by the Political Staff in Mesopotamia is such as to minimize the chance of the - repetition of such practical demonstrations of Arab discontent.3. It appears to the Council that the course of events in Mesopotamia too often takes the form of punitive operations following upon an outbreak. This may be due either to the fact that adequate warning has not been forthcoming or that it has not been acted upon sufficiently promptly by the military authorities. Preventive measures, political or military, calculated to forestall the event would appear to the Army Council to be more desirable from every point of view.4. The Army Council are enquiring from the General Officer Commanding, Mesopotamia, whether he received sufficient warning in the case of Rumeitha, and, if so, what steps he took in anticipation of the situation, but at the same time they would ask Mr. Montagu whether he is satisfied that the system adopted by the Political Staff in Mesopotamia is sufficiently elastic to enable local political officers to give timely information and assistance to the nearest military commander.5. I am to say that so long as the ultimate responsibility of the- military commander for security in Mesopotamia continues, the Council feel certain that Mr. Montagu will share the opinion, that it is as much the duty of the Political Officers to assist the military situation by adopting timely measures, conciliatory or otherwise, to avoid the necessity of the troops becoming* These telegrams appear on pages 6 et seq. of my memorandum, dated 17th July (CP. 1646).

involved, as it is for the military authorities to.support actively the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government when called upon to do so.6. The Army Council desire me to express their conviction that too frequent use of the military for punitive measures combined with promiscuous bombing from the air, which cannot be ensured to punish only the guilty, will only serve to embitter the population of Mesopotamia against the British Administration, while the actual effect in steadying the situation will be but momentary. They are confident that Mr. Montagu is as desirous as themselves of avoiding unnecessary provocation to the inhabitants of Mesopotamia, but /eel it incumbent upon them to point out that within the last 7 months, and with the apparent approval of Lieut.-Colonel Sir A. Wilson, no fewer than 25 cases of bombing from the air against Arab villages have been reported from Mesopotamia.The Council are addressing the General Officer Commanding, Mesopo-tamia, upon the subject of this punitive bombing, but they would be glad, at the same time, to have the opinion of Mr. Montagu on this question, and I am to ask that he will favour them with his observations. as ,to whether this is a desirable means to employ on the above scale for the attainment of the internal security of Mesopotamia.* I am,Sir,   . Your obedient Servant,(Sd.)     JET. J. CREEDY.The Under Secretary of State for India, India Office, S.W. d.    ,
