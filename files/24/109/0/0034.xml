&apos;  THIS DOCUMENT IS THE IttOP&amp;OT OP HIS BRtTAlk^ ilAJBSft^SEGRET CABINET.,P.1633.THREATENED STRIKE jgg MEMBERS OF THE ELECTRICAL TRADESM ;Illf ffll&apos;&apos;&apos;g)F&apos;^l*!IWWi     BBM WRITMemorandum by the Postmaster-General. (Previous papers-C.P*159S and 1626)The Post Office Engineering Union has for many years past been recognised as the Association representing the rank &apos;and file of the Engineering Department of the Post Office.;&apos;&apos;: &quot;:Thfc^ Union/has some 20,000 members at. the present time, which &quot;represents roughly 4/5ths of the strength of the classes which they represent.The Electrical Trades Union only claims to have some 1500 post Office members; and, in the opinion of the officials of the Post Office Engineering Union, this claim is a very ^exaggerated one; they doubt whether the number, reaches 500,A series of Wages negotiations, covering all grades of the rank and file in the Post Office Engineering Department has just been concluded with the Post Office Engineering Union. These negotiations have been based on the maintenance of the Civil Service system of wage scales with annual increments, and the allowance of privileges on -ivil Service lines (sick leave, annual leave and pension rights)/  An exact comparison between remuneration fixed on this basis with remuneration at the flat rates current in the outside labour world is-almost impossible; but during the negotiations the rates fixed under the agreements to which the Electrical Trades Union is a party were constantly kept in view.The Post Office Engineering staff, as.a whole have a . strong preference for. the Civil Service system of wage scales; and it would certainly be contrary to the wishes of the majority if any system of flat hourly rates of payment, such as the Electrical Trades Union stand for, -were to be substituted for the present system.
It would be quite impossible.to conduct separatenegotiations simultaneously with the Post Office engineering union and the Electrical Trades Union, in view of the entirely different&apos;wage systems which these two bodies advocate.   Onthe other hand joint negotiations with the two bodies are equally out of the question, as the feeling of hostility,existing   -between them is very strong.   Evidence of this is to be. foundnot merely in the numerous cases of collision which have occurredbetween men belonging to the two Unions, but also in a resolution passed by the Council of the Post Office Engineering Union onthe 17th ultimo to the effect - ...&quot;That this Council place on record the fact that they : &quot;are opposed to the recognition by the Post Office of &quot;any other body than the P.O*E.U. to represent the &quot;grades now officially represented by the Union; and &quot;that in the event of recognition be:&apos;.ng granted to &quot;the EcT,U, by the Post Office this Council will use &quot;every means within their power to bring about a &quot;general cessation of work in the Engineering Department&quot;.Fairly satisfactory relations have been established between theDepartment and the Post Office Engineering Union; a V/hitleyCommittee has been set up and meetings are constantly held todiscuss wages and other conditions of service.Prom the point of view of public policy, it is in myopinion most undesirable that any steps should he taken whichwould have the effect of increasing the Post Office membership ofthe Electrical Trades Union.   It would be a source of great danger to&apos;the community if a substantial proportion of the men engaged on the maintenance of the telegraph and telephone systems of the country were members of such a Union as the electrical trades Union and liable to be called out on the occasion of a dispute not affecting the Post Office.   At the present time, in *view of the small number of Post Office workmen that belong to the electrical Trades Union, the Post Office can view with comparativeequanimity the activities of that Union, but if recognition &quot;?rereonce afforded, a considerable number of men might pass ;from oneUnion to the other, and the position might be very different. .
In my opinion, there ere strong objections to the Postmaster General, or any of his officials, meeting the-official of the Electrical Trades Union, even if the interview be limited to an announcement that no negotiations can be carried on. The Union has been repeatedly informed to this effect in writing, and it is impossible to believe that an oral repetition , of that decision could conciliate the Union.   On the other hand any meeting or discussion would at once be advertised by the Electrical   Trades Union as s stepping stone towards recognition.   Letters which have been sent to them by the Post Office in the past, declining discussion, have been advertised by them as correspondence proceeding between them and the Postmaster General and have been used as a lever to further their propaganda against the Post Office Engineering Union and to detach its membersc.If it is necessary that the decision should be re-affirmed orally, and in my opinion, it is. not, I think it should be done through the medium of a meeting with the Ministry of Labour and net with the Post office(Signed)    ALBERTt E.ILLIFC-WORTH.General Post Office, e.c., 13th July, 1920,
