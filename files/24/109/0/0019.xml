Despite many efforts made to promote the welfare of the inhabitants and otherwise to fulfil its task, the Governing Commission has observed with regret that it has only too often met with disparagement and hostility.   Among the inhabitants of the Territory there are many who refuse to accept the Treaty of Peace and the authority of the League of Nations.   These hostile elements are chiefly to be found among the officials, the teaching profession, the clergy, and the higher industrial and commercial classes. : They have placed their influence at the disposal of Germany, and have attempted to check all measures taken by the Governing Commission to institute in the Saar Basin, in accordance with the Treaty of Peace, an autonomous administra-tion, independent of Berlin.There have been discovered in the Territory traces of certain German organisations, such as the &quot;Heimatschutz&quot; and the &quot;Saarverein,&quot; whose purpose it is to oppose by all possible means the putting into force of the Treaty of Peace in the plebiscite areas.These organisations command the most widely-read local newspapers.   The Governing Commission scrupulously respects the liberty of the Press;   nothing has been done to curtail the right which certain journalists have arrogated to themselves of casting suspicion on the Commissions loyalty and misrepresenting its intentions.     These attacks do not surprise or alarm the Commission, but it raust.be admitted that&apos;, -in the end, their violence and unfairness react unfavourably upon a population in the main simple-minded, and inclined to believe newspaper statements.In several cases the Commission has met with an inexplicable resistance;   the Decree issued on the housing question,, which has greatly improved the situation, has provoked protests which are hardly justifiable,   practically everything done by the Commission has, despite its loyalty been used against it.   Attempts have been made to discredit . both the League of Nations and the Treaty of Peace, and to prove that the latter;cannot be put into force, and that the task attempted in the Saar Basin is. doomed to inevitable failure. Such are the arguments set forth daily in the. newspapers of the Territory, more particularly in the most important, the &quot;Saarbrucker Zeitung&quot;.   The Governing Commission considers that this systematic campaign of opposition should here be mentioned, as its work is thus greatly complicated, and the confident co-operation of the people rendered difficult.   It is only too regrettable that the activities of a subsidised minority should impede the very delicate mission with which the Commission -has been entrusted.The Commission, however, feels confident of having observed the Treaty, both in the letter and in the spirit, snd, regardless of unjust attacks, it will endeavour to govern the Saar Territory Impartially, end according to the principles of the League of Uations.. In the name: of the Governing Commission. w      -   V. RAULT, The Councillor of State, President.GOVERNING COMMISSION OF THE TERRITORY OF THE SAAR BASIN * SAARBRUCK.1st June, 1920. CONCLUSION OF THIRD REPORT.
