BREAD SUBSIDY COMMITTEE. Report by the Chairman,The Committee were asked to report on the question of abolishing the Bread Subsidy with special reference to any re-action which such a policy might have on existing wage agreements.In considering the question the Committee directed their attention to the following points(1)   $he political danger of a new increase in the cost of the loaf which although it could be compensated by a rise in wages might bring about difficulties out of all proportion to the money value of the increase;(2)   The danger that wages once increased will tend to remain permanent at the high level to which they have risen even when the cost of living has fallen again;(3)   The fact that the price of bread will be increased by        on the 4 lb. loaf in the Autumn of this year . and that the Bread Subsidy must come to an end not later than July 31st, 1921:   the Cabinet decision . t* allow a free market to homegrown wheat from that date making it impossible, for administrative reasons which are explained below, to continue the subsidy;(4)   The necessity for reducing the floating debt, and the economic effect which such reduction would have in deflating currency, improving the credit facilities of manufacturers, and in increasing the value of real wages.The Committee are impressed by the political danger of a further large increase in the cost of the loaf at the present time.   In the opinion of the Ministry of Labour, the effect would be to give rise to a period of dangerous unrest in industry pwing to the high oast of living.   To take off the Bread Subsidy altogether would put the price of the 4 lb. loaf up from 1/0^ to 1/4 and unless the local price of wheat can, after the removal of the Subsidy, continue to be limited, would put it up to l/5d.   It appears from the figures submitted to the Committee that the effect of abolishing the Bread Subsidy altogether could be compensatedI JfaJs POOUMBHT IS, THE. ^PROPERTY OP HIS BRIjgANJIIO MAJESTY&apos; S AVERMENT )ri?      \. 3 B OR ST, Copy Ho.     ,S      \CP. 16 02A, &amp;JL B I II E 3V

On the other hand,-irresistible pressure would be exerted throughout industry, generally for an increase in wages to meet the additional.cost of living.     This, it is&apos; calculated,-.would-involve an increase an-i the Wages Bill of the country of &quot;fifty-millions por. annum., ,on &apos; the top of a Wages Bill which&apos;has already increased by; 500 millions during the&apos;last two&apos;years.-The Committee have considered the argument put forward.by the Treasury that it would be better to face an increase of wages to this extent than to continue the Subsidy..     In the view of the Ministry of Labour the psychological effect of the increase would be of far greater importance than its actual money value.   But the Committee are even more impressed with the danger of further increasing the standard&apos;of wages, because the attempt to reduce-wages when the cost *f - living falls is certain to give rise to , industrial disturbance.   It has been represented that in the long run wages will inevitably follow prices and that when prices fall, wages will automatically&apos;come down.   The Committee-, however, are *f opinion that it is no longer possible to regard Labour as a commodity the&apos;price of which is regulated solely by the laws of supply and demand, and that the artificial conditiens produced by highly organised &quot;Trade- IJnions--^re-such that it will mt be possible to reduce wages-whenever prices- fall. -The Committee have also considered t&amp;e arguments submitted to them by the Treasury, that the reduction of the Bread Subsidy would mean a reduction of the floating debt, with a consequent deflation of currency, leading to lower prices, and would there-fore, eventually enure to the benefit of the working classes* by&apos; increasing employment and- enhancing&quot; the value of real wages-.   $ha Committee feel-,- however., that inasmuch as the economic arguments would not convince&apos; the working classes, the political

App, II. 6.) to allow a free market to British gro^w wheat after&apos; July 31st, 1921.   It would be administratively impossible for the Wheat Commission and the Ministry of Food to fulfil this ipibedge if the existing arrangements are continued by which they sell wheat to the millers at a price below the world&apos;a price for wheat, the difference in effect representing the Bread Subsidy.   Owing to the fact that the large millers at the Ports buy.almost exclusively foreign wheat, while the small inland millers buy homegrown wheat, it is impossible to arrange a system of rationing      imported wheat.   On the other hand, the fheat C&amp;n.^ mission have no machinery through which to buy wheat from farmers all over the country.   The only possible courses are either to aholish the Bread Subsidy so soon as there is a free market for home-grown wheat, or to continue the exlsting^arrango-* ment and to fulfil the Government guarantee of/free market price to farmers by paying the difference between the world&apos;s price an  the price paid by the millers in the form of a direct acreage subsidy to individual farmers.   The Committee are convinced that on political grounds the latter course cannot be seriously enter-tained and are therefore driven to the conclusion that in view of the present policy of the Government the Bread Subsidy must termin-ate altogether &quot;by July &apos;3let, 1921, when the new British wheat, sown during the coding Autumn will be finding its way to the market.As a result of the recent decision of vthe Cabinet to restrict the amount of the Bread Subsidy to a sum of 4? millions on the current financial year/the price of the loaf will increase to l/lld. in the autumn of this year; ; and the Committee have been assured that a further increase of lid. at faster 1921 and a final increase to l/5d. in July 1921 could be made without adminis-trative difficulty.   This would&apos; create less disturbance than the
compile withdrawal of the subsidy&amp;y-atr-one stroke&amp;a -and &quot;this is --thqcourse which the Committee suggest should be taken .The Committee have bcsa impressed by an argument putforward in a Memorandum by the Chairman of the Royal Commission on wheat Supplies,that it would be exceedingly dangerous altogetherto postpone the removal of the Bread Subsidy until a period of, acute trade depression, which might occur next year.It is hooed that there may possibly be a decrease in the other&apos;.price of/foodstuffs which would make the increase in the cost of the loaf less burdensome to the people, but it should here be stated that no fall in the price of food is anticipated for the next three months.With regard to the facts which the Cabinet desire in.regard to the French and Italian Bread Subsidies, a Memorandum is appended which has been prepared by the Ministry of Food, containing such information as is available&apos;  The Ministry of Food, however, express considerable doubt whether the figure of 8,000 million lira given as&apos; the total of the Italian Bread Subsidy is accurate.The Committee recommendsA progressive reduction of the Bread Subsidy by three successive stages, its final removal taxing place on 31st July, 1921.(Signed)     R,S.

APK5IIDTX,   .    &quot; BREAD CONSTJMFPION. PRICES &amp; SUBSIDY^FRANCE *Pro-war consumption of wheat.in France was T,600,-000metric tons of home grown andM,200,000 metric ions of Imported.The corresponding per capita rate of consumption was 3451b. of flour per annum.    For the cereal year 1919-20, o-onstanpiion.isestimated at Y&apos;,100,000 metric tons of wheat or 305 lb. of flourper head per annum, I.e. 13 per,cent below the,pre-war rate.Present estimates for the 1920 crop put it at 6,500,000 metric tons (net) which would provide about 300 lbs. of flour per head.The French Ministry of Agriculture state that if this estimate is realised, it will be sufficient to meet the needs of thecountry with a high extraction rate and the use of diluents.Bread card3 were first issued in December 1917, and were used only in communities of over 20,000 inhabitants.   Rationingwas abolished in June, 1919, but tho question of re-introducingit is under the consideration of the Government in view of thocost of the subsidy to the state.   ,(Note: prices are given in English currency at par rate of Exchange,)The average pre-war price of bread per 41b. loaf was 7d.From July  3 18 to February 1920 the price wa3 loid.    From march the price was raised to l/6d. in order to reduce the amount ofthe subsidy.    But in order to modify $he hardships involved forcertain classes  by this higher price, it was found necessary tointroduce a modified form of rationing of bread at a lower price for these classes.    This was done by a docreo of 15th March which provided that the following classes should be ablo to buy 14 oz.per head per day at tho o^.d price of lO^d.(1)   Heads o  families having 3 or more children under 16 years of ago.(2)   Women trith 2 or more children under 16 years of ago.
(3)   Ex-service men g  at least 50$ disability.(4)   Old people, invalids and incurables drawing benefit under the Law of 14th July, 1905.The cost of the bread subsidy during the years 1916-19 amounted to 4,652 million francs or at par,  186 million.    At present the French Chamber votes a monthly amount to meet the subsidy.     The amount for Juno was 30,000,000 francs or  1,200,000. The continuation of this rate scorns to be dependent on the&apos; -substantial realisation of the hopes rcgirding the sufficiency of the forthcoming home crop.     Imported wheat would add to the subsidy at the rate of  21,000,000 for each million tons imported.    Another recent estimate puts the total subsidy at approximately  24,000,000 per annum.The wheat policy for the coining season is a scheme for rigid control.    The Government will continue to monopolise the importation of foreign wheat and the purchasing of home grown wheats    Growers will be guaranteed a remunerative price for the next three years, to be fixed each year by a special commission, representative of both producer and consumer.The Agricultural Commissioner had laid before the Chamber of Deputies1&apos; a scheme (1) to fix the price of the 1920 wheat crop at 100 francs- per 100 kilos   (174/6 per 480 lb. at par) to bo paid to the French growers, and (2) advising the grant of a bonus   of 200 francs per hectare (65/- per aero at par) for wheat sown in the liberated regions.    If this scheme were adopted, the price of bread would have tp bo increased from 1/6 to 1/10 per 4 lb. loaf, or a corresponding addition made to the subsidy as calculated at (3) above, but the proposal has met with considerable opposition.ITALY.The pre-war consumption of&apos; wheat was 5,800,000 metric tons of wheat&apos; (4,400,000 home grown and 1,400,000 imported).,.
-or-approximatelj 26o lb., of flow per head per annum.The 1919-*20 consumption is estimated at 6,400,000 metric tons of wheat (including. 2,400,000 metric tons of imported)* or approximately 310 lb. of flour per head, which is a considerable increase on the pre-war rate..The estimates for the 1920 crop, put it. at.3,400,000 metric toriri available  or consumption^     It io proposed to restrict the imports to half the rate for tlie calendar year 1919, i.e..to 1,500,000 tons of wheat; on this basis the total available would be about 3,900,000 tons of flour or 255 lb. per head of the population..   This represents an effort to effect a large reduct-ion itt consump-tion^pwing to the financial pressure of the subsidy.Rationing of bread was introduced in October, 1917, and was withdrawn-in the autumn of 1919..   The consumption of cereals, however, rose, so rapidly during the winter that it. was found necessary  to re*introduce rationing.    The general ration is 250 drams (or 9v03.) oo? head per day, with an additional ration of if oz. macaroni per day..The pre-war price of fefead was 7d. per 4 lb. loaf.    In May 1920 it stood at l/Sf. Signor Nitti recently stated that the loaf of 1 lb. which was sold at 3^di cost the Government l/ld.The amount of the subsidy involved is estimated at 8,000 million lire per annum, &apos; The high price offoreign wheat, aggravated toy the adverse rate of exchange, led the Government to introduce a bill early in June with the intention of raising the price of bread/.   The original intention was that there should be two qualities of bread to be sold at 4/- and 1/5 per 4 lb. loaf respectivoly. .   This proposal caused-considerable dissatisfaction and the plan was dropped. .   a Din. was then suomitteo to f^lu^ni in which it was proposed to have only one class of bread to be sold at 2/2f per 4 lb. loaf, the price of macaroni being also raised toK
9d. per lb.    In ouler to prevent the increased cost of bread falling too heavily on the working classes, the bill provided that employers should refund to their workers the increase in the price of broad, and that the state should refund to employers the sums so advanced from the proceeds of a special tax on all persons in receipt of incomes over  400 per annum.    The proposals of the bill led to disturbances and riotfc throughout Italy and were the immediate cause of the downfall of the Government, So far as is known, the price of bread remains at 1/2?-*   per 4 lb, loaf with the resulting cost to tho Government indicated above.Ho special measure has been adopted for the 1920 crop, but the. Under Secretary of State is empowered to fix prices, having special regard to the districts that have suffered mosi severely from the drought.The wheat crop of 1921 Trill be brought as followsLire por       Per qr. of 480.1b, quintal,&apos; at par rate.Soft wheat 125- 215/9Hard wheat 145 250/3In addition premiums will be paid a3 under Soft wheat 21*5 3/8JHard wheat 2*5 4/sfto grov/ers in the South and In the redeemed provinces
5 U MM A R ,Y.The measures outline d .abo^e^hwrbid^hTee- atrjeeta. tiT jiewr- , (1) to relieve tho burden of tho state Involvedin the payment of a subsidy on broad, (2) to avoid any excessive hardships on the poorer classes involved in a high price for their staple article of food* (3)to encourage homo production. -Tho principal means chosen to reach these ends also fall into three groups.(1) The reduction of consumption by rationing or. bydilution with cheaper grains&apos; (2) The differentiation of qualities and pirices of bread.(3) The offer of guaranteed prices. If the first of these measures is to be oiccecsful in its object, it requires an elaborate administrative machinery. Dilution has proceeded to a greater degree in France and Italy than at any time.in this country,- and at no time has the rationing of bread been attempted here.    The differentiation of4 quality and price has broken down where it was tried owing to political objec-tions, especially from labour interests.    This was also the experience of Belgium.    The third group of measures is particuOar ly important for countries which are suffering from a serious adverse  ate of exchange.
