PART I.-THE LABOUR SITUATION.THE GENERAL SITUATION.General Survey of the Week.The most important event of the week under review was the publication on the 16th July of Awards Nos. 395 and 396 of the Industrial Court relating to the engineering and shipbuilding trades, details of which are given on p. 133, below. It is as yet too early to judge what reception these awards will obtain from the men concerned.The general industrial situation, in so far as actual disputes are concerned, is quiet. The gas workers whose unofficial strikes were a disturbing feature last week have now returned to work. Mr. Clynes has been active in arranging the suspension of these unofficial disputes. Wages negotiations in the woollen and worsted industries, and in the road transport industry, are suspended, in the former case pending ballots of the men involved. The coal miners await the reply to their demands. The situation in the printing trades is difficult, owing to the insubordination of the Liverpool and Manchester branches of the Typographical Association.The Labour situation in regard to the Irish and Russian questions remains unaltered. The Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress met on the 21st July to decide the course of action to be adopted to carry out the decisions of the Special Trades Union Congress on the 13th July.The Unemployment Insurance Bill was read a third time in the House of Commons on the 19th July, and was passed.The Unemployment Position.The number of H.M. Forces and Merchant Seamen out-of-work- donation policies current for the week ending the 9th July was 156,844, made up of 155,996 lodged by men, and 848 by women. On the 2nd July there were 163,050 policies current, 162,131 by men and 919 by women.On the 9th July, 73,256 unemployment books, 51,433 for males and 21,823 for females, remained lodged by workers under the Unemployment Insurance Acts. Compared with the previous week, when there were 47,972 books lodged by males and 21,241 by females, the total increase is 4,043.The total live register for all Employment Exchanges on the 9th July was 234,770 men, 46,440 women and 22,760 juveniles, compared with 235,051 men, 47,262 women and 22,357 juveniles a week ago, and 257,402 men, 46,777 women and 20,964 juveniles a month ago.  A detailed analysis of the unemployment position will be found on page 139.FEATURES OF THE WEEK.General Topics.The Gost of IAving-Uhe Labour Gazette,cost of living index figure of the 1st July shows the increase from July 1914 as 152 per cent., an increase of 2 per cent, since the 1st of June.The joint committee representative of the Trades Union Congress, the Labour Party and the co-operative movement, who are. inquiring into the causes of high prices, met at the House of Commons on the 14th July. The committee are first to deal with finance and currency, and hope to publish an interim report on these subjects in time for presentation
to the annual Trades Union Congress in September. The committee have already taken the opinions of Mr. McKenna, Sir George Paish, Mr. J. A. Hobson, Professor Pigou and Mr. Pethick Lawrence. In addition, the secretariat of the committee are carrying on independent investigations, for example, into the relative cost of different methods of building, and into the conditions which govern the prices of different commodities. The latter side of this inquiry is being undertaken in conjunction with the co-operative move-ment.Employment Exchanges. The Committee of Inquiry resumed their sittings on the 19th July. Evidence was given by Sir William Beveridge, Director of the London School of Economics and Political Science, and Mr. John Turner, general secretary of the National Amalgamated Union of Shop Assistants, Warehousemen and Clerks. Sir William Beveridge said that the connection of Employment Exchanges with unemployment insurance affected all their methods and scope. Unemployment benefits could not be adequately administered except by a method similar to that of the Exchanges, because by no other method could it be ascertained in what cases benefit was payable. In order to deal with trade fluctuations, it was essential to have unemployment insurance. With regard to the trade unions, he pointed out that at present the smaller proportion of workers belonged to unions dispensing unemployment benefit, and it was certain that these organisations could not grow in machinery and numbers sufficiently quickly to cover the field in time for the next depression. The only thing to do at present would be to keep both Exchanges and unions engaged in the work until the latter might be in a position to deal completely with the administration. In conclusion, he said that the Exchanges had never had a fair chance for development.Mr. John Turner said that during the payment of out-of-work donation, the action of some Exchanges in dealing with women created intense hostility. The big distributive establishments normally relied on advertisement or private agencies to secure their labour requirements.Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades: Periodic Review of Wages. In connection with the four-monthly review of wages in these trades, the Industrial Court heard claims on the 29th. June put forward by the various craft unions for a general advance of Qd. per hour for journeymen time-workers, and equivalent advances for piece-workers, and by the National Federation of General Workers for a general advance of 20s. per week for adult workers. Half these amounts were claimed on behalf of apprentices and juniors. The claims of the workpeople were supported principally on the ground that the cost of living had increased since the last advance, on the 10th March, 1920 ; that in other trades advances in wages had taken place greater than those given in these trades ; and that the condition of trade would justify a further increase in wages. On behalf of the employers it was submitted that the total advances already given wjere adequate to meet the increase in the cost of living which had occurred since the outbreak of war, and that the commercial position was such that a further advance in wages would be accompanied by grave risks of injury to the trade.The Court found that the claims submitted had not been established. They reiterated their opinion that an alteration in the cost of living, although of great importance, does not in itself, and. apart from other considerations, necessarily warrant any corresponding increase in wages. With regard to the engineering and foundry trades, the Court doubted whether the terms of the agreement of February, 1917, permitted a comparison with other trades as a governing factor in arriving at their conclusions, and in any case they were of opinion that at the present time, when industrial conditions were still disturbed, such a comparison would not afford a satisfactory ground for their decision. The negotiations in progress between the employers and certain of the unions, with a view to the consolidation of war advances and the establishment of permanent post-war rates, afforded an opportunity of taking into consideration the earnings in other trades. With regard to the state of trade, the Court had directed their attention to the question whether there had been since March an improvement in the state of trade or an alteration of general conditions sufficient to justify a further increase in rates of wages. The conclusion of the Court was that the position to-day did not differ from that four months ago to such a degree that the settlement effected bv their last decision should be disturbed.Engineering and Shipbuilding Industries: The 44-Hour Week In this connection it may be useful to review the position with regard to the demand of the engineering and(b 10290) S 2
Features of the Week-continued.shipbuilding unions for a 44-hour working week. It will be recalled that it was determined last Djcembir to appoint a Joint Committee of employers and employed to investigate the economic relation of production to hours of work in these industries, and the methods of manufacture in the shipbuilding and engineering industries in this and other countries, and that pending the completion of this inquiry the claim for a reduction in working hours from 47 to 44 should be adjourned.By the 4th June, 1920, four meetings of this Joint Committee had taken place. Questionnaires had been sent to over 200 firms, visits to works in this country had been arranged, and preparations had been made to visit in the United States and Canada, a - number of selected establishments where the 44-hour week is stated to be already in operation.The annual meeting of the Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades Federation, however, in May, 1920, asked that a meeting of the trade unions concerned should be called with a view to their withdrawal from the inquiry and the prosecution of their claim on other lines. It was urged that more satisfactory progress might be made by petitioning the Minister of Labour to set up a Court of Inquiry under Part II of the Industrial Courts Act to investigate the claim. The conference of trade unions accordingly took place on the 4th June, hut decided against any reference to the Minister of Labour, apparently on the ground that the employers could not be expected to agree to a Court of Inquiry and that the Minister therefore would hardly agree to its establishment. The present position, there-fore, is that the proposal of the employees is still under consideration by the joint body.Goal Industry. Restrictions on the export of coal are stated to be causing unemploy-ment amongst dock workers and seamen in the coal exporting ports, principally in South Wales and Northumberland. It is reported that a representative conference of railwaymen and transport workers in the Bristol Channel area will meet on the 1st August to consider what action may be taken to remove the restrictions. A meeting of seamen at Cardiff has been reported at which there was considerable criticism of the South Wales miners&apos; attitude towards hours of work and output.The South Wales branch of the National Association of Colliery Managers have passed a resolution expressing the strongest opposition to the pit committees proposed under the Ministry of Mines Bill. The complaint against the committees is that they will tend to weaken discipline, interfere with the statutory duties of managers, and be of no assistance in maintaining or increasing the output of coal.Trade Union Topics.The Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain and the Amalgamated Engineering Union. A joint meeting of the executives of these two bodies was held on the 14th July in London, to discuss demarcation questions with regard to members of the Amalgamated Engineering Union employed by colliery companies. It is understood that a working agreement was reached. A joint sub-committee, to which five members have been appointed from each executive, have been instructed to formulate a detailed scheme for submission to a further meeting of the executives. Details of the scheme put forward by the engineers were given in this Report for the 19th June, page 712.South Wales Miners&apos; Federation-It is reported that the second ballot of the members of this body on the question of increased contributions to the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain will be taken on the 27th and 28th July.National Federation of Foundry Unions. It is reported that a special council meeting of this Federation will be held in August to discuss the question of the complete amal-gamation of the constituent bodies. The Friendly Society of Ironfounders of England, Ireland and Wales, the Associated Ironmoulders of Scotland, and the Amalgamated Society of Coremakers of Great Britain and Ireland have already amalgamated to form the National Union of Foundry Workers.National Union of Clerks. It is reported that the London members of this union employed in newspaper offices have transferred their membership to the National Society of Operative Printers and Assistants. They will be organised in a special clerical section of the society, with considerable powers of autonomy. The National Union of Clerks, however, are proceeding with their scheme of establishing a guild within their fold for printing and publishing clerks.
Amalgamated Union of Co-operative and Commercial Employees and Allied Workers.-The ballot of this union on amalgamation with the National Warehouse and General Workers&apos; Union has resulted in 51,562 votes in favour of amalgamation and 3,076 votes against. It is reported that some friction exists between this union and the National Union of Boot and Shoe Operatives, the Amalgamated Union being accused of poaching.General Union of Textile Workers. It is reported that nearly 600 weavers in the silk and plush mills at Nuneaton have decided to become members of this union. It may b noted that dyers in the Nuneaton area are reported to be joining the Amalgamated Society of Dyers, Bleachers, Finishers and Kindred Trades. The head office of the General Union of Textile Workers is situated at Huddersneld, and the head office of the latter union is in Bradford.National Union of General Workers. It is reported that the annual conference of the Amalgamated Society of Gas, Municipal and General Workers, held at Cheltenham on the 12th July, resolved to accept the recommendation of the council of the union in favour of complete fusion with the National Union of General Workers.Ex-Service Men.Amalgamation of Ex-Service Organisations-T^he National Federation of Discharged and Demobilised Sailors and Soldiers have issued an invitation to the four other main bodies catering for ex-Service men, namely, the Officers&apos; Association, the National Association of Discharged Sailors and Soldiers, the Comrades of the Great War and the National Union of Ex-Service Men, to join in a conference on the 7th August, to discuss the possibilities of amalgamation. The invitation has been accepted by the Officers&apos; Association and the National Association; a tentative acceptance has been received from the Comrades of the Great War; no reply is to hand from the National Union. The attitude of the last body was to be expected, as their basis is acceptance of the &quot; class war.&quot;Bristol Ex-Service Mm. A party of some 15 to 20 members of the International Union of Ex-Service Men started on a march from Bristol to London on the 14th July, in order to protest against the alleged non-fulfilment of a jpromise of the Prime Minister to grant them an interview. It is understood that they hope for the co-operation of other centres in sending a deputation to see the Prime Minister on the position of unemployed ex-Service men in the country. The men are expected to arrive in London on the 25th July, when a demonstration of welcome will be held in Trafalgar Square.Disabled Ex-Service Men&apos;s Training Association. It is reported that an organisation under, this name has been formed to express the dissatisfaction of some disabled ex-Service trainees with their conditions. The main complaints of the association are the lack of sufficient training, and the inadequacy of training allowances. The men contend that no man should leave a training centre until he is a competent workman, and that his com-petency should be decided by a board consisting of representatives of the Government and of the trainees, and a trade union official.International Relations of Labour.The Second International. The tenth annual Labour and Socialist Congress will be held on the 31st July and the following days at Geneva. The invitation to the Congress has been issued to all Socialist and Labour parties or organisations which subscribe to the following three formula : (a) The political and economic organisation of the working class for the purpose of abolishing the capitalist form of society and achieving complete freedom for humanity through the acquisition of political power and the socialisation of the means of production and exchange, that is, by the transformation of capitalist society into a collectivist or communist society.(&amp;) The international union and action of the workers against imperialism with the object of bringing about a real League of Nations.(c) The representation and advancement of the interests of oppressed peoples and subject races.The invitation is extended not only to those bodies now affiliated to the Second Inter-national, but to all other organisations animated by a desire for international socialist unity.
Non-affiliated organisations may take part in the debates of the Congress in a con-consultative capacity, and thus reserve freedom of ultimate decision.The agenda will include, in addition to matters of more direct domestic concern, the following matters of general international, policy: Peace and the League of Nations, democracy versus dictatorship, socialisation, the political system of Socialism, labour legislation, colonial policy, emigration, and the high cost of living.The British delegation representing the Labour Party, the Trades Union Congress and the Fabian Society include the following : Messrs. W. H. Hutchinson, Ramsay Macdonald, Sidney Webb, A. G. Cameron, Tom Shaw, M.P., Neil Maclean, M.P., F. W. Jowett, W. Adamson, M.P., Will Thorne, M.P., J. H. Thomas, M.P., Harry Gosling, F. Hall, M.P., J. B. Williams, R. B. Walker, W. J. Davis, T. Swales, Dr. Lawson Dodd, Dr. Ethel Bentham, Dr. Letitia Fairfleld, Miss Susan Lawrence, Mrs. Harrison Bell, Miss Mary Macarthur and Mrs. Sidney Webb. &apos;At the same time as the general Congress, there will be organised a conference of representatives of Socialist and Labour parliamentary groups, with a view to the creation of a permanent commission of these groups. A Press conference will also be held which will consider the establishment of an international socialist telegraphic agency.International Federation of Trade Unions. The minutes of the Management Sub-Committee meeting of the General Federation of Trade Unions on the 17th July throw an interesting light on the relations between the English trade union movement and the International Federation.Included in the minutes is the full text of a letter addressed by Mr. W. A. Appleton to M. Edo Fimmen, joint secretary of the International Federation of Trade Unions, communicating the decisions of a meeting on the 3rd June of the Joint International Committee, representative of the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress and the Management Sub-Committee of the General Federation of Trade Unions.. On the subject of the Hungarian boycott, the letter stated that the Joint Committee were of opinion that if the boycott were effective its effect would be felt most seriously by those who were already suffering grievously. They doubted the possibility of making it effective, and thought that more carefully considered and diplomatic measures would help the Hungarians better.The question of a special conference of the International Federation in the autumn, to discuss the distribution of raw materials for industrial purposes, the problems arising out of exchange rates, the socialisation of the means of production, and the protection of the trade-union movement in various countries, had also been considered, hut the Joint Committee were in direct opposition to the proposal, and expressed the opinion &quot; that the International had much to do in order to consolidate itself and that a conference such as the one suggested would involve both headquarters and affiliated organisations in an expenditure which the circumstances did not appear to justify.&quot;The payment of contributions to the International Federation had also been considered, and the meeting had endeavoured to elaborate a method which would avoid overlapping between the two British organisations. Mr. Appleton wrote that this was made impossible through the had impression created by the manifestos and telegrams issued in respect of Hungary and France, * and by what was considered to be the superfluous nature of the proposed conference in the autumn. He suggested that the affiliation of the Parliamentary Committee had been endangered but reported that the two committees have arranged to meet in September at Portsmouth on the occasion of the Trades Union Congress to complete any arrangements that may be made concerning contributions.* This probably refers to the action taken by the Bureau of the International Federation on receipt of the appeal of the Confederation Generale du Travail on the 13th May, during the general strike in France, &quot; to join its protest to the action of the French proletariat, who are determined to defend their class organisation against the repressive measures of the jGrOvernment.&quot; ....
NEGOTIATIONS AND DISPUTES.Demands and Negotiations.Metal, Engineering and Shipbuilding.Ship-Repairers (Mersey District).-Ship-repairers in the Mersey district, including riveters, caulkers, blacksmiths, platers and shipwrights, have applied for a weekly wage of  7 when employed and an allowance of  5 10s. a week when not working. The employers replied that they were determined to abide by the general award of the Industrial Court for the engineering and shipbuilding trades.Transport.Canal Workers (National). The National Transport Workers&apos; Federation and the National Union of Railwaymen have made a joint application on behalf of canal workers for minimum wages of  4 10s. for captains,  4 5s. for mates, and  4 for labourers. The Ministry has been asked to call a conference of the parties concerned.Tramwaymen (National). The executive of the United Vehicle Workers met on the 20th July to consider the question of applying for a further advance in wages on behalf of tramwaymen. They have received applications from various branches, including that of the Manchester tramwaymen, for an increase of  1 per week, and it is probable that these will be co-ordinated in one national demand. This will be forwarded to the executive of the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation for negotiation.Printing and Allied Trades.Printers.-Negotiations have been taking place during the week in the hope of averting the threatened lock-out of members of the Typographical Association. On the 16th July at a meeting of the Joint Industrial Council for the Printing Trade it was arranged that the executive of the association should instruct the Manchester and Liverpool branches to withdraw their embargo on overtime, which has been in existence since the 12th July, the employers at the same time agreeing to suspend their lock-out notices. These two branches, however, refused to obey instructions, with the result that evening papers were not published in Manchester and Liverpool on the 17th July. A further meeting of the Joint Industrial Council is being held on the 22nd July.Food, Drink and Tobacco.Bakers (London). London operative bakers are demanding a minimum of  4 for a 48-hour week, an advance of 8s. on present weekly wages.  Negotiations are in progress.Public and Public Utility Services.Street] Paviors (Leeds). The street paviors employed by the Leeds Corporation are demanding payment of the building trade rate of 2s. 4d. per hour. This has been refused by the Corporation.Street Paviors and Road Makers (Newcastle).-Th.e Newcastle Town Improvement Committee have decided to refer the paviors&apos; and road makers&apos; demands for building trade rates to an impartial tribunal. A sub-committee are to meet representatives of the men to carry out this suggestion.Miscellaneous Trades.Funeral Workers (London). There is every probability that the wages dispute in the London funeral trade* will be settled without a strike. The men concerned are considering offers from the Proprietary Cemeteries Association of  3 15s. a week for grave diggers,  3 8s. for assistants, and  3 3s. for gardeners, and from the British Undertakers&apos; Association of 10s. a week increase for coffin makers, coachmen and clerks.Strikes and Lock-Outs.Mining and Quarrying.Quarrymen (Northumberland and Durham). A strike of stone quarry men began on the 19th July in Northumberland and Durham owing to the refusal of the employers to consider the men&apos;s demand for the building trade rate of 2s. Ad. per hour.* See this Report, Vol. II, No. 1, 3rd July, p. 9, and also p. 61, below.
Negotiations and Disputes-continued.Metal, Engineering and Shipbuilding.Electricians (London Docks). The strike of electricians employed by the River Thames Dry Dock Proprietors and Ship Repairers&apos; Association, which began on the 1st July,* in support of a demand for the payment of the district rate of 2s. 3d. per hour, is still in progress.Agriculture.Agricultural Labourers (Cheshire). It is reported that agricultural labourers in the Chester district are resuming work, but in other parts of the county the strike continues.Settlements and Agreements.Building and Allied Trades.Building Trade Operatives (Port of London). Building trade operatives employed at the London docks who struck on the 30th Junef accepted the terms of settlement reached at a joint conference on the 14th July, and work was resumed on the 16th. The men will obtain their full demands, as the Port of London Authority have agreed to pay the award of the Building Trades Conciliation Board of 2s. 4d. for mechanics and 2s. Id. for labourers to all building operatives, and to observe the 44-hour week.Packing-Case Makers (Manchester). The strike of packing-case makers was settled on the 16th July. The workers receive an immediate increase of 2d. on their wages of 2s. per hour ; the further 2d. demanded and the question of holidays are to he dealt with at a joint conference to be held within the next three months.Public and Public Utility Services.Gas Worh,rs.-YoY the settlement of the unofficial strikes in various centres see p. 163 below. Mr. J. R. Clynes gave a written guarantee that if, after work was resumed, the Regional Council do not reach decisions which the men are prepared to accept, he undertakes to support the men in their desire to cease work to enforce further concessions. The Regional Council for the Lancashire, Cheshire and North Wales district began their sittings on the 19th July .to consider the men&apos;s claims.[Other disputes, negotiations and settlements, are referred to in the Wages and Arbitration Departments section of the Report, pages 160 to 164.]* See this Report, Vol. II, No. 2,10th July, p. 51.      f See th^ Report, Vol. II, No. % 10th July, p. 50.

During the week the men&apos;s live register has decreased by 281 while the women&apos;s live register has decreased by 822. The vacancies carried forward, exclusive of vacancies in suspense, show a decrease of 957 as regards men, and a decrease of 1,813 in respect of women. All the divisions except the London and South-Eastern, the West Midlands, the Yorkshire and East Midlands, the North-Western and Wales show decreases in the men&apos;s register. The Exchanges showing the largest decreases are Borough, Shepherd&apos;s Bush, Tooting, and Preston. The occupations chiefly affected by the decreases are those of clerks, carmen, seamen, porters, shop assistants and general labourers. Increases in the register are reported from Camberwell Green, Croydon, Westminster, Woolwich, Norwich, Southend, Coventry, Chesterfield, Hull, Leeds, Birkenhead, Bootle, Newcastle, Barry, Bute Docks, Sandycroft, Shotton and Swansea. The occupations chiefly affected are those of painters, builders&apos; labourers, fitters, engineering labourers, steel smelters, riveters and shipyard labourers.As regards the women&apos;s registers all the divisions show decreases except the London, and South-Eastern, the South-Western and the West Midlands. The Exchanges showing the greatest decreases are King&apos;s Cross, Darlington and Glasgow. The occupations chiefly affected are those of domestic servants, waitresses and clerks.Men&apos;s Employment.General Outlook. Reports generally do not indicate any marked variation in the4 state of unemployment during the week. There are still important local indications of depression in the shipbuilding and allied trades, notably on the Mersey, where there is a continued slackness in the various repair works of the port of Liverpool. This is thought to be due in some measure to the new wages demand made by the shipwrights and boilermakers.The depression in the Lancashire cotton industry is still felt, and many Exchanges report short-time working arrangements and extended holiday stoppages. Notwithstanding present adverse appearances hopes of an early revival are widely entertained.The effects of the strikes on the part of municipal gas employees have been felt in other industries dependent for their power on gas. The trades engaged in the manufacture of boots and shoes, rubber goods, margarine, lace and clothing are still subject to considerable depression ; and the leather trade must be regarded for some time as a declining industry.
Industrial Developments. It is reported from Openshaw that the Whalley Housing Corporation have taken over a large piece of ground in West Gorton, where they propose to manufacture material required in the construction of concrete houses, 500 of which are to be erected in the near future. In the .main these houses will be erected by unskilled labour. Messrs. P. &amp; W. Anderson, Ltd., Sheffield, have commenced work on a large housing contract for Messrs. Crosse &amp; Blackwell, Ltd., at Burton-on-Trent. Their labour requirements have been circulated nationally, but the contractors are independently endeavouring to recruit building operatives in Ireland. The erection of these houses, together with certain additions to the factory and the construction of railway sidings, is expected to occupy nearly two years, and the work should absorb most of the local labourers. lj Labour Reductions-Messis. Lever Bros., Ltd., Port Sunlight and Liverpool, have discharged 1,000 workpeople during the week and propose to dispense with a further 1,500 during the next two weeks. At Southport, the Vulcan Motor and Engineering Co., Ltd., have discharged 100 workpeople and given notice to a further 500. In each of these cases the reduction of staff appears to have been occasioned through production being in excess of the prospective demand. Redruth report that 120 men have been discharged from the Tincroft Mine. At Taunton, Messrs. Hockey &amp; Co., Ltd., lace manufacturers, have closed down indefinitely owing to shortage of work. At Birmingham a number of the local trades are becoming very slack, notably the cycle trade, gun trade, general engineering trade and motor and cycle tyre trade.Shortage of Labour. The manager of the Central London Exchange for the Building Trades reports that the demand for bricklayers, carpenters and plasterers is still heavy, and that much difficulty is experienced in securing even a small percentage of the skilled men required. Slackness is still noticeable in the painting and decorating trade. This is now also observable in the electrical trade, and among hot water pipe fitters, a large percentage of workmen of these two trades being out of employment. There have also been some indications of slackness in the plumbing trade, but as yet few claims to benefit have been lodged.The insufficient supply of skilled labour for the building trades is still the subject of frequent comment in reports from the provinces. In particular there is at the present time a marked demand for bricklayers and joiners. In other.trades the outstanding demands are for moulders of all classes, shipwrights, coach makers, weavers, boat-builders and quarrymen. aMiscellaneous. The shortage of raw materials, due to transport difficulties and other causes, is still fairly widespread, but is specially marked in a number of engineering and shipbuilding centres in Scotland and the north of England.The Divisional Controller of the South-Western Division has completed arrangements with the authorities of the Aldershot Command by which soldiers about to complete their -service with the colours may report at centres, throughout the camp, not less than one month before the date of discharge. The men are interviewed by a representative from the Aldershot Exchange. In suitable cases the pre-enlistment employer is communicated with to secure the man&apos;s reinstatement. Where this course is not possible, however, efforts are made to place the men by ordinary Exchange procedure. General Lord Rawlinson has issued an explanation of the scheme in Command Orders, and as the normal garrison of the Command is 30,000 it is expected that much useful work will be done.Women&apos;s Employment.General Industrial Situation. Reports from the Exchanges continue to show slackness in industry. The most noticeable drop in the demand for workers is reported in connection with the jute and the jam-making industries, the vacancies falling within a week from 206 to 33 in the former trade and from 239 to 7 in the latter.The general depression in the London and South-Eastern Division continues in the factory areas of Bermondsey, Camberwell, Camden Town, Canning Town, Hackney, King&apos;s Cross, Shoreditch and Willesden. A number of London and Scottish Exchanges report seasonal slackness in the tailoring and needlework trades.There is no change in connection with the employment of women in the cotton textile trade; short time continues in several centres, for example, Burnley, Chorley, Colne, Manchester, Huddersfield and Mansfield, but steady trade is reported at New Mills, Roy-ton, and Nelson, where the mills are working full time. Slackness is also reported in the silk, woollen and worsted trades of Leek, Dewsbury, Batley and Bradford. The strike of doublers is said to have affected the position of the textile workers of the Stockport area.
General depression continues in the leather, boot and shoe, and slipper industries. Kettering, Leicester, Northampton and Norwich all report small discharges or short time in the local works. $ The slipper industry of Bacup also reports a lack of orders.The lace-making industry which is centred at Basford, Beeston, Long Eaton and Ilkeston is not expected to experience a revival of trade until September, and similar conditions are reported in connection with the hosiery trade.In the Glasgow area clerical workers are still in demand, chiefly as temporary holiday reliefs. As the local supply has been exhausted several applicants have been imported from other districts. A growing demand for skilled shorthand typists has been noted in London, Newcastle and Bristol, but only women with high speed are acceptable in London.Local Reports. The London and South-Eastern Division report small discharges from and general slackness in the majority of the London factories, the tin workers of Bermondsey, Camberwell, Deptford, Hackney and Shoreditch being especially affected. Leather workers, soap workers, and rubber workers are also reported to be working short time at Canning Town, Bermondsey and Camberwell. With regard to laundry work, skilled ironers and packers are required at Ilford, Acton, Brentford and Camden Town, but there is a surplus of calender hands in the majority of the London districts. Seasonal agricultural and market garden work is absorbing much unskilled labour at Ponders End, Canterbury and Eaversham, while favourable reports with regard to the placing of women in seasonal domestic work have been received from Deptford, Stepney and Folkestone. Skilled wire-mattress weavers are still required at Hollo way, and book-binders at Leyton.In the South-Western Division increased placings in seasonal domestic.work have been obtained by co-operation between the Exchanges of supply and demand areas, notice-ably at Bristol, Cowes and Weston-super-Mare. Many unskilled workers in the Gloucester district have been absorbed in fruit and pea picking.Although there is a general slackness in all the industries carried on in the West Midlands Division, vacancies for brass polishers are still open at Aston and Birmingham. Hereford report the discharge of 100 women workers from the National Filling Factory. The wholesale clothing factory at Tamworth is working short time owing to lack of orders, lt is reported that a new confectionery factory will be opened at West Bromwich during September.In the South Midlands and Eastern Division many women have been absorbed in connection with fruit picking at Cambridge, Chelmsford, Kings Lynn and Norwich. In-dustry at Braintree is suffering from the general depresssion in the textile trade and the elastic web works at Coalville have received a check. A number of women who were unemployed owing to seasonal slackness in the straw hat industry at Luton and St. Albans have been induced to accept seasonal domestic posts.Several of the women discharged from the Royal Naval Mining Depot at Immingham desire to learn net-braiding, but owing to the seasonal quietness of the trade it has not been possible to arrange for their training. A number of women wire-workers have been discharged from the Concordia Wire Works at Long Eaton in consequence of the abolition of night shifts, and it is understood that a furniture manufacturer at Netherfield has dis-charged 30 French polishers owing to slackness. There continues to be a demand for buffers and burnishers at Shefiield, pottery workers at Swadlincote and weavers at Sowerby Bridge; women cannot, however, be imported into the last-named town owing to the lack of lodging accommodation, which continues to restrict the movement of skilled labour in the Yorkshire and East Midlands Division.The annual works holidays in many of the industrial centres of the North-Western Division have caused business to be very quiet. The continued general depression in the cotton trade is reported to affect the rubber, waterproof garment, and wire-work industries. All these trades are working short time.It is reported that two new firms making skirts and costumes are to be established at Newton Heath during the next few weeks. There are many applicants registered for this, class of work.In the Northern Division 689 vacancies have been filled by the Darlington Exchange in connection with the Royal Agricultural Show ; 489 were filled locally, and 200 by women from other districts.Discharges have taken place at the toy factory of Messrs. Foster, Blackett &amp; Wilson, Ltd., Hebburn-on-Tyne. It is expected that several of the women who were discharged from a tobacco factory at Kendal will be absorbed in Messrs. Shepherd &amp; Sons&apos; sawmills. North Shields report an order for workers in the preserving department of the herring industry.
port labour.General.Hull The timber trade at the port is gradually improving and the men placed during the week will be kept on through September and October. Grain, seed, and general cargo work is, however, very quiet.Cardiff. The trade of the port showed a slight increase over the preceding week. At the same time large numbers of men are unable to obtain employment. In the trimming department work remains very quiet.Newport.-There has been no improvement in the general cargo trade of the port. The coal trade has been maintained but the work of discharging has been seriously handi-capped owing to the shortage of traffic. There is a prospect of increasing trade during the coming week.local employment committees.Activities of Committees.Employment and Resettlement. The Bristol Committee are maintaining close co-operation with the Corporation in the formulation of schemes for providing employment and securing grants for the relief of distress. A deputation of three have been appointed to go with three members of the Corporation to meet the Minister of Labour and the chairman of the Development Commission.It is understood that the Belgian Government have agreed conditionally to release for export the timber lying at Antwerp belonging to Messrs. Morelands, to the detention of which the Gloucester Committee drew attention. It is hoped this will bring about the employment of many workpeople at present on the register at the Exchange.  -Weston-super-Mare have drawn the attention of the Somerset County Council to the case of a man in their employment who held another appointment. The Council have now informed the committee that the man has been ordered to cease work forthwith.The Northampton boot and shoe trade is passing through a period of considerable depression. The committee have communicated with firms known to be discharging employees, suggesting that short time should be worked where possible to reduce discharges to1 a minimum.It was reported to the Grimsby Committee that a firm of building contractors had offered wages higher than the standard district rate, thus enticing workmen from the local housing scheme. The committee are of opinion that where a vacancy is submitted to an Exchange offering a rate of wages in excess of the standard rate for the district, it should not be circulated through the National Clearing House.Training. In view of the fact that the National Trade Advisory Committees fix the number of trainees to be accepted in the special trades, the Trowbridge Committee urge that some latitude should be allowed to Local Employment Committees in recommending disabled men for training in special cases. A number of their own recommendations have been refused as being in excess of the prescribed number for the trades, although the committee were confident that in these cases the prospect of employment after training was good. J4The Bath and the Trowbridge Committees have asked the Minister to give authority for the establishment of a Local Technical Advisory Committee for the building trade in their respective districts.Trade continues to be very quiet in Scotland owing to the annual fair holidays. Industry is also retarded by the shortage and high prices of the raw material for glove-making at Dumfries, jam-making and cotton-winding at Paisley and Parkhead, and linen weaving at Dunfermline. Local strikes have also temporarily hindered business in dress-making and millinery at Aberdeen, glass-making at Alloa, and wood-cutting and machinery at Dunfermline. iUthough there is a general slackness in the jute industry at Dundee vacancies for skilled jute workers are still open. Skilled labour is also required for the Barrhead thread works and the tapestry looms at Alloa.Slackness is also reported in the industrial centres of the Wales Division. The National Cartridge and Box Repair Factory at Newport is discharging women and the tin stamping industries of Llanelly and Port Talbot report shortage of material and lack of orders.
40 5Ex-Service Men. The Holloway Committee are of opinion that expenditure in issuing coloured certificates to employers on the King&apos;s National Roll is unnecessary, as employers who from patriotic motives employ disabled men are not of the type to want such a certificate.With a view to providing work for ex-Service men the Northampton Committee are circularising employers who are known to have in their employment married women whose husbands are also in employment.Canterbury call attention to the fact that women continue to be employed in the capacity of appeals officers at Courts of Referees. They consider that this work should be performed by disabled ex-Service men.Women&apos;s Work-The Kings Lynn Committee recently considered certain allegations which were being made locally with regard to the conditions of employment of the female workers in a local manure and chemical factory. A Home Office Inspector visited the establishment in question, but his report, which was communicated to the committee, was not considered to be in accordance with the facts. The firm have been invited to receive a deputation to investigate the allegations.The Tottenham Committee request the Minister to consider the advisability of making the women&apos;s training centre at Ponders End a permanent institution.Miscellaneous. Many more committees have protested strongly against the criticism which is being levelled against the Employment Exchanges. The chairman of the Brighouse Committee, in reply to a statement in the Leeds Mercury that &quot; not one word of commen-dation had been received in favour of the Exchanges,&quot; sent a letter refuting this statement, but his letter has not yet been published.out-of-work donation and unemployment insurance benefit.Payments Made.For returns of the amounts paid upon out-of-work donation policies and in un-employment insurance benefit during the last week, see the report of the Finance De-partment under this heading on p. 153 below.Work of the Courts of Referees.Out-of-Work Donation Appeal Cases (Great Britain). During the week ending the 8th July, 1,468 cases were referred to appeals officers, 1,505 were heard by Courts of Referees, and 1,421 cases were outstanding.The total number of cases heard by appeals officers up to the 8th July was 449,498. The total number of cases heard by the Courts was 421,518. An analysis of 408,850 cases heard shows that 108,804 claims were allowed, 299,502 disallowed, and in 544 cases a corn-promise was arranged. The proportion of disallowances to total claims heard was 733 per cent. Of the number disallowed 42*9 per cent, were cases of refusal to accept suitable employment.Out-of-Work Donation Appeal Cases (Ireland). During the week ending the 8th July, 60 cases were heard by the Courts, and three dealt with by the appeals officers, making a total of 63 cases disposed of at 18 sittings.The total number of cases heard by the Courts up to the 8th July was 25,701. An analysis of 24,514 cases heard shows that 7,429 claims were allowed, 16,985 disallowed, and in 100 cases a compromise was arranged. The proportion of disallowances to total claims heard was 69*3 per cent. Of the number disallowed, 41-3 per cent, were cases of refusal to accept suitable employment.Unemployment Insurance Benefit Appeal Cases (Great Britain). During the week ending the 8th July, 136 cases were heard by the Courts of Referees and 131 cases were outstanding.The total number of cases heard since the 14th July, 1919, up to the 8th July, was 4,324. An analysis of 4,098 cases heard shows that 1,239 were allowed and 2,858 disallowed. In the remaining case a compromise was effected. The proportion of disallowances to total claims heard was 69&apos; 7 per cent. Of the number disallowed, 34 * 7 per cent, were cases of the voluntary leaving of employment.Unemployment Insurance Benefit Appeal Cases (Ireland).-During the week ending the 8th July,.seven cases were heard by the Courts of Referees.
The total number of cases heard up to the 8th July was 250. An analysis of 241 cases shows that 52 were allowed and 189 disallowed. The proportion of disallowances to total claims heard was 78*4 per cent. Of the number disallowed 64&apos;6 per cent, were cases of the incidence of the trades dispute proviso.discharged and disabled sailors and soldiers.National Scheme.Up to the 13th July, 1920, 18,573 certificates have been issued to employers enrolled under the National Scheme. The undertakings furnished by these signatories to the Scheme covered 179,043 disabled ex-Service men and the total number of workpeople employed by them is 3,050,028.Canvassing is still in progress. Although all the firms in the areas ha\e probably been visited once, further visits are being paid where necessary.A further relative increase in the number of signatories, 273 during past week as against 178 in the previous week, is no doubt due mainly to these second visits, but, as mentioned in a previous report, most of the firms who have lately signed undertakings were already employing the required quota of disabled men.At a meeting of the Gloucester Employment Committee on the 21st June it was reported that up to the 31st May, on which date the special intensive canvass was completed, about 90 per cent, of the employers in the district had given undertakings. Consideration was given to the question of employers who had not taken into employment the full number of disabled men in accordance with their undertakings, and it was decided to send a letter in such cases asking how many disabled men the firms had in their employment and if it was possible for them now to engage any more.In the areas covered by the Oakengates Employment Committee and the Sowerby Bridge Employment Committee, 84 per cent, of the employers have given undertakings.A number of local authorities have now passed resolutions in favour of municipal contracts being given only to firms who are enrolled under the National Scheme.Placings.Interesting placings of men are reported from the Yorkshire and East Midlands Division. One man suffering from neurasthenia was. placed with a silk firm as handy-man, another with gunshot wounds in leg and arm with firm of plasterers. Another man, with gunshot wounds in the right leg, was placed as a feeder with a firm of woollen manufacturers, a type of work hitherto done by women.juvenile branch.Juvenile Employment Committees.After-Care. Reports from Scotland show developments in the after-care work of Juvenile Advisory Committees. The Greenock Committee have been successful in estab-lishing an after-care committee for Port Glasgow. Their energies will be directed par-ticularly to the welfare of boys coming from other districts to work in the shipyards. The Bridgeton and Parkhead Committee have started a special industrial rota to interview juveniles in employment. At the first meeting, to which boys only were invited, over 50 per cent, responded to the invitation. The majority appeared to be doing well, but a certain number of cases called for inquiry on the part of the Exchange officer. The Dundee After-Care Committee, who also work as a Juvenile Organisations Committee, have obtained the use of a school for a girPs club,and over 100 girls have been enrolled as members. The expenses have been guaranteed by local employers.Apprenticeship in the Building Trades-As the result of action taken by the Chester-field Juvenile Employment Committee an agreement governing the conditions of appren-apprenticeship in the building trades, excluding plumbing, painting and plastering, has now been signed by the local master builders&apos; association and the local branch of the National Federa-tion of Building Trades Operatives.The Derby Juvenile Employment Committee are expecting to consider the final draft of a local building trades apprenticeship scheme at their next meeting, and the Aberdare, Brighton, Hastings, Hereford, Medway, Newark, Oldham, Tynemouth and Weymouth Committees are making prelinnnary inquiries in connection with this matter.

Of these, 21,758 have been recommended and 4,096 rejected.Copies of the scheme prepared by the Joint Industrial Council for the Building Industry have been circulated to all Juvenile Employment Committees for their guidance.Apprenticeship in the Engineering Trades. The Juvenile Advisory Committees at Ashton-under-Lyne and Heywood have recently held conferences with local employers and workpeople in the engineering trades. Both conferences decided that the use of indentures should not be recommended, that boys should commence apprenticeship at not later than 16 years of age, and finish at 21, that the abolition of premiums should be supported, and that medical examination before apprenticeship was necessary.Employment of Children in Blackburn. The annual report of the Blackburn Juvenile Employment Committee, for the year 1919-20, states that an investigation was recently made into the number of school children employed before and after school hours and on Saturdays. The result showed that 520 children from 8 to 12 years of age were employed. Six boys and two girls were found to be employed from 31 to 40 hours per week, 71 boys and 10 girls from 21 to 30 hours, 180 boys and 12 girls from 11 to 20 hours, and 153 boys and 86 girls from one to 10 hours per week.[Reference to matters of interest to the Employment Department will also le found on pages 132, 133, 135,151 to 155, 158 and 159.]

Information has now been received regarding the case of the ex-officer who recently had to give up his engineering training with Messrs. Scott &amp; Hodgson, Ltd., Guide Bridge, Manchester, on account of the opposition of the trade union. The trainee is 20 years of age and joined the Colours direct from school. The reason put forward by the union for their opposition is that they have a number of unemployed apprentices on their books and also that they consider that the trainee was getting special treatment because of his being an officer. Endeavours are being made to find an alterna-tive training firm for the applicant as soon as possible.Reports from Directorates.-!]! Dundee in spite of the slackness of trade, many firms continue to help by notifying their vacancies, and in one of the largest, the Dundee, Perth &amp; London Shipping Co., Ltd., the department continue, from time to time, to place men as deck engineering officers, on the office staff and in similar positions.In the Edinburgh Directorate a special canvass has been made on behalf of several difficult cases which have been on the register for a considerable time with the result that three placings have been effected.The Director at Manchester reports that there are some signs of improvement in the cotton trade, but that on the other hand shipping is not expected to improve until September. The hope of placing a considerable number of ex-Service men with the calico printers&apos; federation has not been realised, as trade union membership was essential, and the men had not that qualification.The banks are substituting ex-Service men for women on their staffs, and insurance companies and textile firms are being approached to induce them to take similar steps.The Director at Cardiff reports that the unsettled conditions existing in the coal industry and in South Wales shipping make it very difficult to secure in this directorate vacancies in these important industries but the number of vacancies obtained by canvassers in other professions and trades is good.In the Leeds Directorate the unsatisfactory position in industry continues, and the outlook is far from bright.  Placings, however, continue to be satisfactory.During the week a large number of candidates have completed training and qualified as pharmaceutical chemists.   In anticipation of this, an energetic canvass of the district has been made, and as a result 27 have been found appointments during the last few weeks.Several firms in Birmingham and district are considering a further discharge of men, or closing down for one or two days a week. The former alternative seems more frequently adopted, especially in the motor trade. A local trainee, an ex-officer, has passed highest in all England, at the recent examination of the Law Society.
TRAINING DEPARTMENT.EX-SERVICE MEN.General.Statistical.-On the 14th July 24,115 men were in training, as against 24,048 on the 7th July, and 23,821 on the 16th June. On the 14th July there were 22,084 men awaiting training, the corresponding totals for the 7th July and the 16th June being 22,445 and 23,721 respectively.On the 14th July the number of men whose training had been completed since the 1st August, 1919, was 13,056, the totals for the 7th July and the 16th June being 12,640 and 11,469, respectively.The number of terminations recorded, 416, is well up to the average, the figures from the Yorkshire and the Scottish Divisions being specially high. The number on the waiting list continues to drop and in the London and the South-Western Divisions a reduction of nearly 300 has taken place. On the other hand, there has been a somewhat unaccountable rise of 99 in the waiting list of the South-Eastern area. The Divisional Director of the Scottish Division reports that &quot; the dislocation of training work consequent on the summer holidays in the various parts of the country may tend to prevent any marked increase in the number of men in training for a month or so, but thereafter unless unforeseen circum-stances arise there should be a continuous upward movement until the estimated maximum of from 3,000 to 4,000 is reached.&quot;During the nine weeks ending the 30th June, a weekly average of over 600 men were placed in training. The period was perhaps favourable, as several large factories were opened, and in certain areas there was a marked rise in the number of admissions owing either to an increase in training facilities or to vacancies caused by terminations. It seems probable that for the next two months there will be a good deal of fluctuation, with, it is to be hoped, a rise as the summer merges into the autumn.Exhibitions. A number of journals have published special notices of the forthcoming exhibition at the Central Hall, Westminster. Among these one of the most interesting was an interview with the Minister which appeared in the Evening Standard of the 14th July. The Minister is reported to have stated that the quality of the work shown will surprise even trade experts, having regard to the &quot;comparative shortness of the period of training, and to the fact that the majority of the men had no previous knowledge of the particular trade in which they are now working.Treasury sanction has been obtained for expenditure upon a stand to be erected in the grounds of the Royal Dublin Agricultural Society&apos;s Horse Show for the purpose of demon-strating the work of the Appointments and Industrial Training Department of the Ministry. This show is one of the greatest events of the year at Dublin.BespoJce Tailoring (Cambridge). The chairman of the Local Technical Advisory Committee for the Bespoke Tailoring Trade for Cambridge has contributed to a local journal an account of the work of the men in training in Cambridge. In this district a good many of the men who have been trained complete their extended courses in country places where they can acquire knowledge of the special class of trade suitable to rural districts. At one time there were four one-legged men in the course and another with two artificial limbs. One of the one-legged men, previously a miner, came from an out-lying area and had been on the waiting list for over six months. As there were difficulties in placing him near his home, he was admitted to the course. In a few months circum-stances rendered it desirable that he should be nearer to his wife and family, and arrange-ments were made for the latter part of his training near his own village. He is now able to earn between  3 and  4 per week in addition to his pension.Hostels.-Treasury sanction has been received for the establishment. of mess rooms at the Derby, New Basford and Chiswick Factories. These mess rooms are a compara-tively inexpensive type of canteen, and will probably become a common feature in a large number of the factories. Meals are not served, but hot water and facilities for cooking food are provided.When it was proposed that the canteen at the Government Instructional Factory, Garrison Lane, Birmingham, should be closed, the men were anxious to have it carried on
at their own charge and without expense to the Ministry. Permission has now been given for the continuance of the canteen in accordance with the scheme submitted by the management on behalf of the men.In connection with the Sarisbury Court Government Instructional Factory, Treasury sanction is being asked for the allocation of the profits of the wet canteen and shop to a welfare scheme.Government Instructional Factories. The number of men in training at Sarisbury Court has now increased to 71, and the available accommodation has been increased to 135. The vacant places are being filled as rapidly as possible by the Divisional Director. A course of training in basket making will be started here at an early date. The report of a recent inspection shows that a very good start has been made. The men in training in the carpentry shop begin to show excellent results, while the men training in agriculture are doing good practical work on the farm and learning the various processes which will enable them to become successful smallholders. The men in training have had the oppor-tunity, during the recent wet weather, of instruction under glass in the potting sheds and in the lecture room.  Estimates of the requirements for a poultry farm have been submitted.The number of men in training in the Walker Factory increased from 204 to 243 during the past week. The Building Trades Advisory Committee visited the factory recently, and were well satisfied with the way in which the training is being carried out. The Furnishing Trades Advisory Committee have also visited the factory recently and recom-mended an increase in the number of admissions to certain courses. Several orders have recently been received for the cabinet-making, joinery and upholstery classes. This factory expects to send a comprehensive exhibit to the Central Hall.Training has now started at the temporary premises at Bailey Street, Sheffield, and the Edinburgh Government Instructional Factory is expected to open next week.The number of men in training under factory conditions has risen from 1,138 on the 14th October, 1919, to 4,830 on the 3rd July. There has been an increase of 1,685 men in the past three months.  The number of factories on the active list is now 37.Equipment and Supplies.-T)e\ivenes at the Central Stores during the week include tools for sign-writers, plasterers, cabinet makers, bricklayers, shoemakers and watch and clock repairers, rubbing boards, straight edges, carpenters&apos; and plumbers&apos; tool bags, consumable stores and a small consignment of woodworking tools. A large number of despatches have been made from the stores during the past week, but the position with regard to woodworking tools has not altered materially. In other respects indents have been fully supplied.Under the sanction for the purchase of tool kits for all trades, certain items have now been acquired by headquarters, and the Office of Works have been asked to state the quantities they can deliver under the scheme within one week from the 15th of the month.Treasury Sanctions.The following are among the most important proposals that have received Treasury sanction since the issue of the last Report.Authority to transfer from the Ministry of Munitions a portion of the Hayes National Filling Factory known as the Canteen Block and the Garage.Authority to acquire, under Regulation 2 (a) and (6) of the Defence of the Realm Regulations, the premises known as the Townhead Street Laboratory, Sheffield, and to rent certain vacant land adjoining from the Sheffield Corporation for a sum not exceeding  150 per annum.Schemes Sanctioned.During the week seven schemes, providing 295 places, have been sanctioned. Included in this number are 100 places for training as taxicab drivers in London.National Trade Advisory Committees.Building ,-A.t a meeting of the Building National Trade Advisory Committee, held on the 8th July, a report of the deputation, consisting of the chairman and secretary of the National Trade Advisory Committee, to the Birmingham Local Technical Advisory Com-mittee was discussed at some length, and a resolution was passed affecting the area to come
WOMEIVS TRAINING.General.Central Committee for the Training and Employment of Women. The number of applications for assistance to the Central Committee has reached a high and continually increasing figure. Work in this connection devolves upon the Women Training Officers, who represent the Training Department on the Interviewing Boards, and also make investigation, on behalf of the Central Committee, to ascertain the best way of securing the training desired by the applicants and the prospects of obtaining subsequent remunerative employment.under the jurisdiction of the Birmingham Local Technical Advisory Committee. Further resolutions were also passed concerning the constitution of other Local Technical Advisory Committees in the West Midlands Area.The Committee were informed of the total numbers of men in training in each process according to the Local Technical Advisory Committees&apos; returns. The resolution in the name of Mr. Gould, of the Amalgamated Society of Carpenters, Cabinet Makers and Joiners, was then considered. The resolution expressed the belief that the building trade had already absorbed their quota ol 5 per cent, disabled men, and proposed that no more trainees should be admitted after the 30th June. Mr. Gould questioned the figure given of the total number of joiners in training, and obtained leave to amend the resolution by adding a clause providing for consideration by the employers&apos; associations and the opera-tives&apos; unions, their findings to be considered at an early meeting of the committee.The amended resolution, which provides for the reconsideration of the percentage of disabled men to be absorbed, will be considered at the next meeting on the 5th August. In the meantime it is understood that all branches of the Amalgamated Society of Car-penters, Cabinet Makers and Joiners and the General Union of Operative Carpenters and Joiners will be circularised in order to ascertain the total number of joinery trainees from trade union sources. There will probably be a discrepancy between these figures and those furnished by the Local Technical Advisory Committees, which do not include the men placed directly in workshop training without the committee&apos;s knowledge.Carpet. The question of training disabled ex-Service men for this trade has been again considered by the Joint Industrial Council, and as the result of a canvass of the manufacturers in the trade, it has been decided that there are no openings for absorbing more men into the industry.Local Technical Advisory Committees,Building. The inaugural meeting of the Doncaster Committee was held on the 23rd June.  The meeting was conducted by the Chief Technical Officer.The inaugural meeting of the Oxford Committee will take place on the 15th July.Delay has occurred in calling the first meeting of the West Bromwich Committee, owing to the dispute as to the area of the Birmingham Committee. The National Trade Advisory Committee have now passed a number of resolutions, which have been accepted by the department, regarding the Local Technical Advisory Committees in the West Midlands Division, and a first meeting of the West Bromwich Local Technical Advisory Committee will accordingly be arranged.A proposal has been put forward for a Local Technical Advisory Committee to be formed at Trowbridge, and investigations are being made in the matter.Lace.-The inaugural meeting of the Nottingham and District Local Technical Advisory Committee is to be held on the 15th July.Lettering.^ A request from the Divisional Director of Industrial Training for Essex has been received for the information of a Local Technical Advisory Committee for ticket writing, and the necessary steps are accordingly being taken to have this committee set up.Vehicle Building. Local Technical Advisory Committees are being set up at Chelten-ham, Coventry, Gloucester and Ipswich.
Women&apos;s Training-continued.Extension of Schemes. Under j)he limited extension of training, 4:8 schemes are con turning and the total number of trainees provided for is 1,609. In some of these courses a certain number of vacancies exist owing to the fact that the trainees had expected the classes to close on the 30th June, and had in some cases made arrangements to enter employment. Where the period remaining for, the completion of the course is sufficient to provide for a refresher course for new trainees, efforts are being made to fill these vacancies with specially selected girls. It is hoped in this way to place in training as many as possible of the women clerks who are being dismissed from the Army Pay and Records Offices and from the Ministry of Pensions. No clerical or commercial courses are available, however, and many of these girls are either unfitted or unwilling to receive training in laundry work, cookery or dressmaking, which is all that can be offered.Upholstery (/Sta/ord!).-Seventeen trainees are taking advantage of the 16 weeks&apos; extension of this course. The trainees have now made samples involving all the processes which they are to be taught, and are engaged on private orders. The class was visited by delegates from the upholsterers&apos; union who inspected the work and expressed their satisfaction.Clerical Course (Southampton).-&quot;-The trainees at the Southampton, clerical course had a final shorthand test and only one failed to attain the speed of 60 words per minute. Five reached the speed of 120 words per minute, and several more were able to do between 80 and 90 words per minute. The principal of the College generously arranged to continue the class without fee for a week after the 30th June, in order that the trainees might complete their twelve weeks&apos; course. Good employment was then awaiting six of the trainees, some at  2 per week, and others at 35s. per week.Dressmaking and Tailoring (Hammersmith). An exhibition of students&apos; work was held at the Hammersmith. Trade School for girls on the 8th July, and included a very good display by the Ministry of Labour trainees in the dressmaking and tailoring classes. Judging by the proficiency indicated the trainees seem entirely suitable for high-class employment.Disabled Nurses.During the week two fresh applications have been received, one for a course of secre-tarial training to occupy six months, at the end of which the trainee will proceed to a post with a doctor as secretary.Sanction has been obtained for an extended course at Clark&apos;s College for a fully trained nurse who is not yet sufficiently experienced to take a post. One applicant from the North of England has just begun a course of institutional housekeeping at Charing Cross Hospital. The reports of the disabled nurses in training continue to be most satisfactory.War Widows and Dependants.During the week ending the 10th July, the number of fresh applications was maintained, 20 having been received, bringing the total to 2,438. In 18 further cases training was authorised bringing the total of sanctions to 1,347. Thirteen applications were rejected or withdrawn, and there were three withdrawals from training. At the end of the week there were 386 war widows in training, and 622 had completed their training.Since the transfer of the training powers to the Ministry of Labour on the 1st September, 1919, 1,202 applications from war widows have been received. During the same period 630 have been sanctioned, and 722 have been rejected or withdrawn.APPRENTICES AND BOYS. interrupted apprenticeships.Questions Affecting the Scheme.Wages.-Wages difficulties are being experienced in the case of some non-union firms ; in the Yorkshire and East Midlands area trouble with such firms appears to arise largely over the question of wages.  A firm in the London and South-Eastern area are refusing
to accept their apprentices on the basis of the district rate, but will do so only on that of the rate which, as a non-union firm, they have hitherto been paying.A difficulty of another kind has arisen in the case of a non-federated textile firm at Bradford. Their wages are considerably higher than the prescribed rate for the district. They have been basing their apprentices&apos; wages on their own rate, and are considerably disturbed that payment of State grant can only be made on the basis of the prescribed rate.Service in a Technical Unit. The Leeds Employment Committee have recently passed a resolution that the full period of technical unit training should not in all cases count as part of the period of apprenticeship, in view of the fact that many men officially supposed, to be following their trade or a similar trade in a technical unit, were only so employed for one or two hours daily. It may be noted, however, that cases of such service are already dealt with by the department, by agreement with the employers and apprentices concerned, or in case of failure to agree, by reference to the Local Employment Committee.The Scheme in Operation.Statistics. Up to the 14th July, 41 schemes had been approved and applications had been received in respect of 40 schemes. The number of applications received at Exchanges from employers for apprentices, for the week ending the 5th July, was 296, making a total of 41,480. The number of applications received from apprentices was 329, making a total of 46,925.Up to the 14th July, agreements had been received at headquarters in respect of 40,181 apprentices. Grants had been sanctioned in respect of 38,640 apprentices, employed by 15,297 employers. Of these, 13,859 were under the engineering scheme, and 6,434 under the building scheme. The total number of agreements lapsed on the expiration of the appro-priate period of training, or by mutual agreement between the parties, is now 7,528.The Scheme in Different Areas. On the 28th June applications by apprentices under the scheme were distributed among the various divisions as follows : Scotland, 12,847 ; North Western, 7,389 ; Yorkshire and East Midlands, 7,090 ; South-Western, 4,747 ; London and South-Eastern, 3,813 ; South Midlands and Eastern, 3,177 ; Northern, 3,111; West Midlands, 1,888; Ireland, 1,406, and Wales, 1,128. The numbers per 100,000 of the population varied from 263 in Scotland to 33 in Ireland.Applications. In the South Midlands and Eastern area certain misunderstandings continue to prevail among employers, notably that an apprentice is not eligible for accept-ance under the scheme till he reaches the age of 21, many firms thinking that, as State grant is not payable until then, no previous application can be made. Local headquarters believe that, as a result, considerable numbers of apprentices still remain to come under the scheme and point out that, at Leicester, a number have already been brought under it, as a result of explaining to employers the true state of affairs. Local headquarters also urge the importance of bringing these facts to the notice of all employers before the final date for applications, as otherwise it is feared that a number of apprentices, especially those under 21, will be permanently excluded.An increase in applications is expected at Lancaster, as it is believed that local branches of the Co-operative Wholesale Society have nearly a hundred eligible apprentices to bring under the General Scheme; and at Newcastle-on-Tyne the co-operative society have already applied for nearly 50 apprentices.Acceptance or Non-Acceptance. The annual report of the National Joint Industrial Council for the Vehicle Building Industry is stated to contain the following reference to the scheme: &quot; The Interrupted Apprenticeship Scheme is without doubt of immense advantage to the trade, and it is most essential that full advantage should be taken of its very fair provisions in order to secure that the much-needed quota of trained men shall be available for our highly-skilled industry.&quot;Some of the Scottish railway companies still refuse to bring their apprentices under the scheme, or to give them as good conditions without adopting it, as is done by many English railway companies. The matter is in consequence being taken up by the Amalgamated Engineering Union.Non-Olservance. Refusals to pay the wages required continue to be reported. At Carnarvon, the National Electric Construction Co., Ltd., take the line that the

This industry is reported to be giving great attention to the training of apprentices and certain proposals in this connection are set forth in an article upon the encouragement of apprenticeship which has appeared in the Journal of the National Employers&apos; Association of Vehicle Builders. These pro-posals are that the trade obtain some system of registration ; that only qualified registered firms be allowed to train apprentices; that the general conditions in works should be such as to make the trade attractive to lads ; that a proper system of training be instituted and test questions published to enable employers to know what progress to expect from appren-tices at different stages in training; that the Government Instructional Factories, now used for disabled soldiers and sailors, be subsequently converted into training institutions for apprentices, who would attend for a month&apos;s whole-time training*each year; and that employers agree to an interchange of apprentices for short periods to give them a wider knowledge of their trade.Qualifying Examinations for Apprentices. A Liverpool firm of printers urge the neces-sity for apprentices to pass a qualifying examination at the end of apprenticeship. They point out that at present, whilst an employer, on engaging a new man, may ask questions about his past training and experience, he can receive no guarantee of his competence. Only after trial can a real estimate of his capacity be formed, with the risk of spoilt material in the meantime, if the man proves incompetent. ;apprentice came to them as to a technical institute; and under the conditions governing institutional training, they refuse to pay him according to the conditions applying to training in the workshop.Other cases turn on the question of retrospective payment, and instances occur of firms whose financial position renders it difficult for them to pay the amounts involved. Messrs. T. Lawrie &amp; Co., Glasgow, painters, who like many others plead misunderstanding of the scheme, did not bring their apprentice under it till a year after his return to the trade. The firm were badly hit during the war and are now short of work owing to the joiners&apos; strike and have difficulty in paying all the arrears at once. It is suggested, there-fore, that they now pay the full stipulated rate weekly, with an addition ot 10s. per week towards the arrears, and it is expected that this arrangement will work satisfactorily.Training in Operation: Progress. The most recent reports from the London and South-Eastern area are favourable. Training is on the whole progressing well, com-plaints either by employers or apprentices are very lew, and general satisfaction is expressed with the working of the scheme. Local headquarters for the South Midlands and Eastern area quote expressions of approval from employers, and add that even where there have been complaints regarding details of administration, there is genuine appreciation of the national effort on behalf of the returned apprentices.In the Northern area, Messrs. E. Beck &amp; Sons, Newcastle-on-Tyne, and the Ropner Shipbuilding &amp;. Repairing Co., both express great appreciation of the prompt manner in which their repayment claims have been dealt with.Messrs. Hardill, Sons &amp; Co., Cleckheaton, engineers, have been employing an appren-tice draughtsman in the fitting shop, paying him, and apparently, so far as the fitting is concerned, training him, well. But there seems little chance of his becoming a qualified draughtsman during his renewed apprenticeship. The apprentice considers that the difiiculty is due to the standardisation of the machinery manufactured by the firm, and that this prevents them from employing or training him in the drawing office.Institutional Training. Messrs. Bruce, Peebles &amp; Co., Ltd., Edinburgh, engineers, report that the special class at the Heriot-Watt College, Edinburgh; was taken advantage of by some of their apprentices who realised its benefits. Others, however, who might have profited by it, as they were good workers, and men whom the firm wished to attend, prer ferred to remain in the workshop to secure the higher wages obtainable there.The house surgeon of a dental institute in the Midlands has expressed the view that the training of a dental mechanic under a qualified dentist where all his work is done, for the mouth is of far more \value to an apprentice than a period in an institution.

U.Advances to Workpeople.--!:^ number of advances made in May, 1920, was 11,552, divided into 2,210 recoverable advances, and 9,342 non-recoverable advances. The total amount ,of recoverable advances was  1,541, compared with a total for April of  1,299.Shortage of Apprentices: Building.-A leading firm of builders at Newcastle-on-Tyne do not consider the difficulty in their industry to be due solely to the relatively small wages offered as compared with those of apprentices in the Tyne shipbuilding and engineering trades. A more important reason for the shortage is the impression prevalent among parents that the building industry is dying out. The tear of unemployment for three or four months during the year owing to bad weather conditions acts as a further deterrent. This firm consider that the only possible way of recruiting sufficient lads of the right standard lies in the application of such a training scheme as that drawn up by the Industrial Council. Its complete adoption should, in their \iew, be made compulsory by law upon all building employers.The chief difficulty at Farnworth is attributed by the Exchange to the high wages of semi-skilled labour. In local building before the war a skilled man received over half as much again as a labourer, but he now earns only about one-sixth moie. Further, the higher wages ol a semi-skilled labourer in cotton mills and coal mines deter the great majority of boys from entering skilled trades.General.Education Act, 1918: Effect on Recruitment of Boys. A large engineering firm at Leicester, who engage annually an average of 150 boys, complain of the provision of the Act that boys shall not leave school until the end of that term in which they attain the age of 14, since in consequence they can only recruit them at three periods during the year. The firm maintain that they cannot arrange their labour requirements in this way, since their monthly engagement of boys must be fairly regular throughout the year. They suggest that this provision should be repealed, unless its benefits can be shown to outweigh these difficulties.[Reference to matters of interest to the Training Department will also be found on pages 135, 142 to 145, 154, 155, 165 and 166.
INDUSTRIES DEPARTMENT.INDUSTRIAL COUNCILS DIVISION.JOINT STANDING INDUSTRIAL COUNCILS: NEGOTIATIONS.Government Industrial: Trade Joint Councils. A meeting of the sub-committee appointed at the meeting of the provisional committee on the 29th June was held on the 15th July. The sub-committee agreed upon recommendations with regard to the trade unions to be represented on each of the four Councils, and the establishment of a committee to co-ordinate the work of the Councils on matters of common interest. These recommendations will be submitted to members of the provisional committee, when, if accepted, the scheme will be sent to the trade unions concerned for endorsement. The trade union side of the sub-committee will be prepared to consider any amendments to the representation of the trade unions, as at present proposed, that may be suggested by any trade union concerned in Government industrial establishments,JOINT STANDING INDUSTRIAL COUNCILS : REPORTS.Industrial.Cooperage. The Educational Sub-Committee of the Council met on the 14th July to consider the question of technical education for apprentices. A representative of the Board of Education was present. It was agreed to recommend that apprentices should be sent to technical classes on two afternoons per week and in addition two evenings per week, half in the employers&apos; time and half in their own time. It was further decided to get into touch with the Coopers&apos; Company to find out whether they were prepared to take an active interest in the education of apprentices by holding examinations and offering prizes or scholarships. It was suggested that representatives of the company might be co-opted to serve on the sub-committee.Electricity Supply. The District Council for the East &apos;Midlands area met on the 13th July. A schedule of working conditions based on that adopted by the District Council for Lancashire and Cheshire was considered and approved.The National Council met on the 16th July. The chief business was the consideration of minutes of the various District Councils. In connection with the dispute at Liverpool, it was decided to offer to the District Council concerned the good offices of the National Council to bring about a meeting of the District Council in order that the points at issue might be discussed.Gold, Silver, Horological and Allied grades. A representative of the National Union of Gold, Silver and Allied Trades has outlined the terms upon which his union are pre-pared to amalgamate with the Birmingham Jewellery, Silver, Electro-Plate, and Allied Trades Union. An effort is to be made with the co-operation of the employers&apos; side of the Council to get these terms submitted to a full ballot of the members of the Birmingham union.Heating and Domestic Engineering. The Council met on the 13th July. It was decided to issue the new apprenticeship indenture forms drawn up by the Council at a charge of Is. each. Specimen copies were assigned to each side of the Council for adver-tisement purposes. On the question of a^ scheme for payment by results, the operatives&apos; side asked the employers to put forward a skeleton scheme which they could lay before their executive council, and if necessary, refer back to the employers&apos; association. The employers agreed to this. The question of a week&apos;s holiday with pay was referred to the Emergency Committee, as the National Association of Master Heating and Domestic En-gineers had not so far seen their way to sanction the proposal. The Council decided to insert a notice in all trade journals of the York Award of the Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades&apos; Federation Arbitration Court, in a demarcation dispute with the plumbers. The question of setting up. District Councils and works committees was deferred for twelve months, in accordance with the recommendations of the Emergency Committee. It was
decided to refer back to the Education Committee the syllabus of the examination for operatives, in order that they might complete the scheme.Local Authorities&apos; Non-Trading Services, Manual Workers (England and Wales).-An adjourned joint conference on the 5th July resolved that a District Council be formed for Middlesex, Hertfordshire and Essex. A draft constitution was approved, and the first meeting of the Council will be held on the 30th July. The District Council for North-cumberland and Durham met on the 9th July. Interim reports of a sub-committee on grading were approved, and the local authorities within the area were recommended to carry out the National CounciTs resolution on holidays. The District Council for the Western Counties met on the 13th July. A scheme of minimum rates graded according to locality was discussed. Agreement was reached as to the minima for the various grades, and a sub-committee was appointed to allocate the local authorities in the area to the various grades. The District Council for the Eastern Counties met on the 15th July. The report of the sub-committee appointed to consider a grading scheme was considered. No agreement was reached, and the meeting was adjourned for a fortnight when the matter will be reconsidered.Paint, Colour and Varnish.-The Council met on the 15th July. The principal item on the agenda was a wages application for a  4 4s. minimum and a 44-hour week, this representing a  1 increase on present rates. The employers offered a 5s. increase, which was refused by the unions.  The matter is to be referred by both sides to their associations.Silk. The second annual meeting of the Council was held on the 14th July. Alderman R. Morley, of the Workers&apos; Union, was elected chairman in the place of Mr. F. J. Farrell, who has held office for two years. The business of the meeting was chiefly formal. An application from the National Federation of Women Workers for direct representation on the Council was referred to the executive committee, which will afford the federation an opportunity of stating their case. There was some discussion on the report of the Indus-trial Fatigue Committee as to the relation between industrial fatigue and production. An application by the workers for a fortnightfs holiday with pay was again refused by the employers, who contend that the lead in this direction should be given by one of the larger textile industries.Surgical Instruments. The Council met on the 14th July. It was agreed that the existing local joint committees in London and Sheffield and also one in process of formation at Edinburgh, should be constituted as District Councils. A representative of the Home Office attended the meeting and discussed the provision of first-aid in factories. A repre-sentative of the Board of Education dealt with the provisions of the new Act as affecting apprentices.  The Council will consider whether a special scheme should be drawn up.Tramway. The sub-committee on District Councils and works committees met on the 14th July. The draft constitution of the District Councils for Scotland; Lancashire, Cheshire and North Wales; South Wales ; the Midlands ; the Metropolitan area ; and the East, South-East and part of the South Coast were recommended for approval. A draft constitution for works committees was considered and approved for submission to the National Council.The National Council met on the 15th July. Consideration of the draft constitution for works committees was deferred till the 9th September. The reports of several District Councils on the grading of undertakings in connection with the recent wages agreement were approved.Waterworks Undertakings. An adjourned joint conference was held on the 12th July to consider the formation of a District Council for the North Wales area. A draft consti-tution was approved, and the first meeting of the Council will be held on the 22nd July.Wool (and Allied) Textile. The various unions affiliated to the National Association of Unions in the Textile Trades are taking a ballot of their members on the employers&apos; offer in response to the workers&apos; application for an increase of 40 per cent, on current rates.Government Industrial.Admiralty.-TJ!h.e Council met on the 16th July. An important discussion took place on the question of certain established men who withdrew their labour during the iron-moulders&apos; strike, on the instruction of their trade union executives. It was represented by the trade union side that there should be no possibility of these men suffering any lossIndustrial Councils Division-continued.

The chairman pointed out the difficulty of the position in that there was a conflict of loyalties-4oyalty to the trade union and loyalty to the conditions of establishment. It was not competent for the Admiralty to condone any dereliction of these conditions, and as the question involved a grave issue as between trade unionism, and establishment, he advised that the motion should not be pressed. The trade union side agreed to adjourn the question for the time being.War Office.-k second joint meeting between the War Office and the Ministry of Munitions Industrial Councils was held on the 14th July to consider the report of the trade union side of the War Office Council as to the extension of the trade union repre-sentation on the War Office Council necessitated by the transfer of productive establish-ments. The report, which proposed an increase on the employees&apos; side from 12 to 15 representatives, was accepted, and the War Office will reconstitute the official side accordingly.Non-Industrial.Local Authorities&apos; Administrative. Technical and Clerical Services. The Council met on the 16th July. The constitution was amended to provide six seats for representatives of the County Councils&apos; Association. It was decided that the formation of District Councils be proceeded with in September. A draft constitution for local committees was approved and will be issued to the authorities concerned. Consideration was given to a further report from the Salaries Committee on hours of duty, overtime, leave and methods of entry into the service. Agreement was arrived at on leave and overtime, but it was decided that further consideration of hours of duty and methods of entry into the service be held over till a later date.Civil Service.-The National Council met on the 13th July, Sir Malcolm Ramsay, K.C.B., in the chair. The Council agreed as an interpretation of the report of the sub-committee on temporary stalls that the interests of classes already permanently estab-lished should be fully safeguarded ; that persons who were employed in the Civil Service in a temporary capacity before the war in posts which were permanent, or subsequently determined to be permanent, should not come on to the establishment through the limited competitions for temporary clerks, but should be dealt with under the provisions of paragraph 65 of the report of the Re-organisation Committee; that unregistered boy clerks should be regarded as within the scope of the sub-committee&apos;s recommendations ; that whilst established officers should in general be excluded from the forthcoming limited competitions, public faith was already pledged to the admission of members of the tem-porary staff whose temporary service was such as to qualify them to sit at one or other of the limited competitions proposed by the sub-committee and who obtained establish-ment through the limited competition held in October, 1919 ; that the age limit for the proposed limited competitions should be 18 years and upwards; and that, in view of the cessation of the Ministry of Labour scheme for training women, the machinery outlined in the report might be applied to the training scheme of the Central Committee on Women&apos;s Training and Employment.The staff side resolution that any adverse reports on an officer should be communicated to him was further considered, and it was agreed that, except in cases which may give rise to criminal proceedings, full particulars of any charge against an officers conduct shall be communicated to him in writing before any disciplinary action is decided upon. The question of reports other than those involving disciplinary action was reserved for further consideration.It was agreed t*hat persons over 50 years of age should not, as at present, be debarred from establishment in cases in which a pension would be earned by the normal age of retirement.So far as the clerical and administrative classes were concerned, it was further announced that the Government accepted the general principle that permanent employment should be pensionable, and much had already been done and was being done to give effect to that recommendation.It was agreed to postpone until the next meeting the question of setting up a committee of the National Council to. deal with superannuation generally.The staff side made certain proposals regarding the payment of increments to persons holding acting appointments, and the official side proposed that, for the future, where
Industrial Councils Division-continued.an officer is called upon to fill a higher post in an acting capacity against a vacancy, he should receive the minimum of the scale for the post in which he is acting, or, if the scales overlap, his actual rate of pay, or the minimum of the higher scale, whichever is the greater. If he remains in the acting p6st for. more than a year he should receive the increments attaching to the higher post. If an officer holding an acting post is subse-quently confirmed in that post without a break ,his appointment for purposes of increment will date from the time when he began to act. The official side stated that in view of. the diversity of practice in different departments during the war, they could not make this retrospective, but they promised to consider the case of persons now holding acting appointments.The chairman announced that a decision might be expected shortly relating to the war bonus of persons in receipt of salaries over  1,000 a year.joint standing industrial councils: works committees.Brewing. Meetings of the Bristol and Gloucester Brewers&apos; Association, and the Wiltshire Brewers&apos; Association, have been addressed. At the former meeting a resolution was passed approving the establishment of works committees and recommending all the members of the association to adopt the scheme.Flour Milling. The Council having adopted a constitution for works committees, negotiations are proceeding for their establishment throughout the industry. Officials of the District Councils for the North-Western, London, Reading, Eastern Counties. Kent and North-Eastern Districts have been interviewed. It was ascertained that works committees of an informal nature were in existence in most?of the larger mills throughout the country, and that their re-organisation according to the recommendations of the Council was being considered by the District Councils. Officials of the Workers&apos; Union, Felixstowe and Glasgow, the National Union of Millers, London, and the Amalgamated Union of Co-operative and Commercial Employees and Allied Workers, Manchester, were also interviewed on the subject. The West of England Flour Milling Employers&apos; Federation were not in favour of the proposal. One of the directors of Messrs. J. Rank &amp; Co., Ltd., Leadenhall Street, who is chairman of the London Joint District Council, stated that the application of the Whitley scheme to the industry was a distinct and continued success in the mills in his district.Gold, Silver, Horological and Allied Trades.

The workers&apos; side were prepared to accept the recommendations of the Negotiating Committee with certain amendments, but refused to consider any modi-fication of these amendments and no settlement was reached. A further meeting of the Negotiating Committee will be held on the 18th August.[References to matters of interest in connection with Industrial Councils will also be found on pages 137, 145, 149, 151,153 and 162.]TRADE BOARDS DIVISION.PROCEEDINGS  OF  TRADE BOARDS.Hat, Cap and Millinery Trade Board (England and Wales).-At a meeting of the Administrative Committee it was agreed to invite a representative of the Juvenile Branch to attend the next meeting for the purpose of explaining the constitution and functions of Juvenile Advisory Committees. The Committee considered a letter from the Ministry on the examination of applications for permits of exemption by Local Employment Committees. It was agreed to recommend that the Minister be asked to receive a joint deputation of members of various Trade Boards on the subject of the control of investi-gating officers and other matters appertaining to Trade Boards, and to inform him that until the deputation had been received the question as to permits could not be fully dealt with.  The Board endorsed the proposals of the Administrative Committee.The Board resolved to issue a Notice of Proposal to vary the minimum rates at present fixed in respect of certain classes of male workers.  The rates proposed are as follows : For male workers in the cloth hat and cap branch who have not had less than five years&apos; experi-ence after the age of 19, and are employed as cutters or blockers, a general minimum time-rate of Is. 9d. per hour, and a piece-work basis time-rate of Is. lOd. per hour.For male workers in the cloth hat and cap branch who have had not less than three years&apos; experience after the age of 19, and are employed as press-cutters or lining-cutters, a general minimum time-rate of Is.

Id. per hour, and a piece-work basis time-rate of Is. %\d. per hour.Laundry Trade Board (Great Britain). At a meeting of the Institutions Committee the position of cottage laundries was considered and it was agreed to refer it to the Board at their next meeting. A memorandum on the application of the Trade Boards Acts to institutional laundries was adopted and it was agreed to consider it at a further meeting in consultation with a representative of the Reformatory and Industrial Schools Department of the Home Office.Aerated Waters Trade Board (England and Wales).-The Standing Committee considered the subject of the utilisation of Local Employment Committees in the examina-tion of permits of exemption and agreed to inform the Minister that, in their opinion, it was desirable in cases where a personal investigation and report are required, except as regards disabled ex-Service men in which case a report by a Local Employment Committee might be helpful, that investigation should be done by a member of the Trade Board.ShirtmaMng Trade Board (Great Britain).--The Administrative Committee considered the action which the Board might usefully take in co-operation with the Home Office to secure improved conditions in factories and workshops. The workers&apos; representatives on the committee agreed to formulate a scheme on the lines suggested by the Home Office for consideration at the next meeting.The Board met on the 14th July, but the United Garment Workers&apos; Trade Union having previously objected to the constitution of the workers&apos; side, their representatives did not attend the meeting, and the Board immediately adjourned to the 21st July. A deputation from the union was received by Mr. H. Wolfe and it was agreed to consider the constitution of the workers&apos; side of the Board in consultation with the union.
* See this Report No. 16,15th May, p. 553.Trade Boards Division-continued.Milk Distributive Trade Board (England and Wales).&apos;-The Special Negotiating Committee agreed to recommend for adoption a proposal by the Board for special minumum rates of wages for clerks and shop assistants.The principal rates proposed for (a) areas administered by Rural District Councils excluding towns with a population exceeding 10,000; (b) areas other than (a) and (c); (c) City of London and Metropolitan Police Districts, except such parts as are administered by Rural District Councils, are as follows; For male clerks, 21 years of age and upwards, 60s., 67s. Qd., and 70s.; for male shop assistants 21 years of age and upwards, 55s. 62s. 6d. and 65s.; with correspondingly lower rates for younger workers in both cases.For female clerks 21 years of age and upwards, 38s., 42s. and 48s.; for female shop assistants 21 years of age and upwards, 33s., 37s. and 42s.; with differential rates for younger workers in both cases.The Board agreed to adopt these recommendations and to issue a Notice of Proposal. It was also agreed to invite a representative of the Juvenile Branch to attend a meeting of the Board at the earliest convenient date to discuss the question of co-operation between the Board and the Juvenile Advisory Committees.Hair, Bass and Fibre Trade Board (Great Britain). Representatives from the Employ-ment Department attended a meeting of the Board to explain the provisions of the Unemployment Insurance Bill. The Board adopted the following recommendations, which were made by the Administrative Committee : That no general minimum piece-rates should be fixed at present for hair-sorting, but certain general minimum piece-rates for hand-loom weaving should be fixed; and that no scheme should be adopted of apprenticeship for male workers or of learnership for female workers, but that a scale of wages graduated according to age should be prepared for male and female workers employed in certain skilled occupations.It was also agreed to accept the offer made by the Employment Department to discuss the question of co-operation between the Trade Board and Juvenile Advisory Committees.The Board decided to fix minimum rates of wages for male and female workers in accordance with their Notice of Proposal, dated the 5th May, 1920,* with the exception of the minimum rates proposed for hand-loom weavers or homeworkers.Jute Trade Board (Great Britain). The Board agreed to invite a representative of the Juvenile Branch to attend the next meeting for the purpose of discussing the question of co-operation between the Board and Juvenile Advisory Committees.A committee was appointed to consider, in conjunction with the Rope, Twine and Net Trade Board, the advisability of formulating a special scheme under the Unemployment Insurance Bill, and another committee to consider the question of adopting schemes of learnership or apprenticeship.The Board agreed to give Notice of Proposal to vary general minimum time-rates for certain female workers in the County Borough of Bootle.Flax and Hemp Trade Board (Great Britain). The Board agreed to refer the question of the minimum rates applicable to female canvas-weavers to the Special Rates Committee and resolved to give Notice of Proposal to vary the general minimum time-rate for warpers and winders, 18 years of age and over, to 36s. per week of 48 hours, and to vary minimum rates in respect of female learners in accordance with the recommendations of that committee, and to fix a general minimum time-rate of 32s. per week of 48 hours for female workers who have had less than six months&apos; experience in the trade.The Board agreed to invite a representative from the Juvenile Branch to attend the next meeting of the Board for the purpose of discussing the question of co-operation.Jute Trade Board (Great Britain). The Skilled Workers&apos; Committee considered the question of fixing piece-work basis time-rates for skilled workers, and it was agreed to report to the Board as a recommendation by the representatives of workers that the piece-work basis time-rate for female weavers, winders, warpers, reelers, batchers and drawers should be lid. per hour ; and one by the representatives of employers that the piece-work basis time-rate for the above-mentioned classes of female workers should be 9d. per hour.
fixing and variation of minimum rates of wages.Retail Bespoke Tailoring Trade Board (Great Britain).-Jl\o Minister has made an Order dated the 14th July, confirming overtime rates fixed for male workers and has specified the 19th July as the date from which these rates become effective.The overtime rates fixed are as follows : For male workers employed on time-work, for overtime on any day except Saturday (or the weekly short day substituted therefor), Sunday and customary public and statutory holidays, time-and-a-quarter for the first two hours, and after first two hours time-and-a-half; for all overtime on Saturday, time-and-a-half; for all time worked on Sunday and on customary public and statutory, holidays, double time ; and for all hours worked in any week in excess of 48, time-and-a-quarter, except in so far as higher overtime rates are payable under the above provisions.For male workers employed on piece-work the overtime rates payable to male workers are . piece-rates, each of which would yield to an ordinary worker not less than the piece-work basis time-rate, in the case of workers for whom such rates have been fixed, or not less than the general minimum time-rate in the case of workers for whom piece-work basis time-rates have not been fixed, with the addition of the whole, one-half or one-quarter of the appropriate piece-work basis time-rate or the general minimum time-rate, respectively, according as the worker would have received double time, time-and-a-half or time-and-a-quarter, had he been employed on time-work.For the purpose of these overtime rates the Board have declared the normal number of hours of work to be 48 in any week, 9 on any week-day other than Saturday, and 5 on Saturday.The Board have also added a proviso that where a worker of the Jewish religion is customarily employed on Sunday instead of Saturday these overtime rates are to apply to such a worker as if in these provisions as to overtime the words Saturday and Sunday were interchanged.[References to matters of interest in connection with Trade Boards will also le found on pages 161 and 165.]WAGES AND ARBITRATION DEPARTMENT.awards.The number of awards issued during the week was nine, eight under the Industrial Courts Act, and one under the Wages (Temporary Regulation) Acts, as modified by the Industrial Courts Act.Industrial Court.structural engineers (lancashire and cheshire). The following hourly rates were fixed for outside men engaged on steel work erecting: erectors, that is, men capable of working aloft and rigging up their own tackle to instructions, Is. l\d.; sheeters, Is. &apos;2\d.; sheeters&apos; holders-up, Is. id.; plus, in each case, the bonuses and percentage advances granted in the engineering and foundry&apos; trades. Working conditions were also fixed. (Award No. 387.)seed crushing and oil milling workers. Advances were granted to adult male time-workers and adult female workers on men&apos;s work, of 5s. per week, or lod. per shift; to adult female workers, not on men&apos;s work, of 2s. per week, or id. per shift; proportionate advances to piece-workers and task-workers. These advances are to be effective, as agreed between the parties, from the 15th May.  (Award No. 388.)engineering and foundry workers and shipbuilders and repairers (national). The Court, having considered the state of trade and general, conditions, found that no general alteration in wages is warranted by the abnormal conditions due to the war. The claims for advances were not established.*  (Awards Nos. 395 and 396.)*6See alsojpage 133, above;Trade Boards Division-continued.
* See*this Report, Vol. II, No. 1, 3rd July, p. 36.agreements and settlements.Boilermakers and Sheet Metal Workers (Southamptonj-Ovex 400 boilermakers ceased work at the shipbuilding yards of Messrs. Harland &amp; Wolff, Ltd., and Messrs. Camper &amp; Nicholsons, Ltd., at Southampton, to enforce their claim for certain work which was being performed by sheet-metal workers. A similar dispute at the yard of Messrs. Thornycroft &amp; Co., Ltd., had been previously settled by arbitration, and the men wanted this settlement extended to other yards in the port. The trade union representative stated that boilermakers were unemployed while sheet-metal workers, whose rates were cheaper, were in demand. The Chief Conciliation Officer arranged a meeting of the parties, and work was resumed pending a settlement. It has since been arranged that the pre-war practice at the works of Messrs. Camper &amp; Nicholsons is to be resumed, and that the boiler-makers shall take all black-iron work below a certain gauge at Messrs. Harland &amp; Wolffs.Funeral Workers (London). An advance was given to undertakers&apos; adult employees of 10s. per week or 15 per cent, on piece-work ; boys and youths under 18 years of age, pro rata. Coffin makers were granted 25 per cent, increase on piece-work rates. These rates are to be effective from the beginning of the pay for the week ended the 17th July.Doubters (Stockport). A settlement of the doublers&apos; strike at Stockport* was reached on the 9th July, by which the employers&apos; offer of l\d. per hour for the night shift, plus 205 per cent, on list prices, has been accepted by the operatives. Work could be resumed immediately, but owing to the gas strike the resumption is delayed.Button Makers (Birmingham). The Chief Conciliation Officer, Birmingham, reports that there has been a great deal of unrest in the button factories owing to the fact that the Trade Board rates were long in coming into operation. The women and girls in the Birmingham area had determined to cease work, but the Chief Conciliation Officer com-municated with their representatives, and was able to inform them of the approximate date on which the Trade Board rates would become obligatory. The threatened strike was averted.Dock Labourers (Milford Haven). Labourers in the employment of the Milford Docks Co. claimed the Bristol Channel rate for labourers, less 2s., that is 82s. per week in lieu of their rate of 68s. (id. The company claimed that the men had always been regarded as railway workers, and had participated in the railway awards. The Chief Conciliation Officer was asked to take the matter up, and was able to avert a stoppage of work by arranging a conference of the parties concerned. The matter was eventually settled by the employers conceding the men&apos;s demand for 82s. per week on the understanding that the men gave up their privileges in regard to holidays, sick pay, and railway fares.Clerks (Milford Haven). Messrs. Brand &amp; Curson, steam trawler owners and ship repairers, received a threat from the local Trades and Labour Council that all labour would be withdrawn if the firm&apos;s clerical staff refused to join a trade union. The Chief Conciliation Officer, Cardiff, was asked to look into the matter. Subsequently the clerks expressed their willingness to join the National Union of Clerks, and this satisfied the Trades and Labour Council.interpretations and rulings.Union&apos;s Interference with Employment.-Mi. Tom Green, a carpenter and a member of the Workers&apos; Union, employed by Messrs. Guest, Keen &amp; Nettlefolds, Ltd., Dowlais, alleged that Messrs. Fisher and Williams, of the General Union of Operative Carpenters and Joiners, and the Amalgamated Society of Carpenters, Cabinet Makers and Joiners, respectively, had wrongfully interfered with his employment or his right to dispose of his labour as he willed, and he sought an injunction restraining them from so doing.In the Chancery Division on the 9th July, Mr. Justice Lawrence dismissed the action with costs. The facts appear to have been that the plaintiff, with three other carpenters belonging to the Workers&apos; Union, was engaged in fixing certain wooden trusses which had been prepared by members of the craft unions, which work, it was claimed by the latter, should have been done by them. The craft unions were anxious to avoid a strike, and came to an arrangement with the management that the four members of the Workers&apos;
Woodcutting Machinists (London). The woodcutting machinists in the London district are still on strike, the number involved being now about 200. The employers assert that they are carrying on with non-union labour, but this is denied by the London representative of the Amalgamated Society of Woodcutting Machinists, who states that sawmilling firms affected by the strike are practically at a standstill, and that in consequence housing schemes are being held up for lack of timber. The Chief Conciliation Officer, London, is trying to arrange a conference of the parties concerned.Woodcutting Machinists (Scotland). The Chief Conciliation Officer, Glasgow, ascertain-ing that both parties were beginning to desire a settlement in this dispute* succeeded in arranging a conference which was held on the 15th July. It was agreed that the society&apos;s representatives should recommend acceptance of the advance of 2fc?. per hour for journey-men, and lid. for apprentices, and further, that the rate of Is. 11c?. per hour should, on 1st October, be increased to 2s. per hour. The rate for Ayr, Irvine and Inverness is to be one-halfpenny less, provided that if the rates for the building industry in these towns are increased, as a result of the levelling up negotiations which are now in progress, the men in the sawmilling industry should get the higher rates obtaining elsewhere. Work was to be resumed immediately.Waterworks Employees (South Essex). The National Union of Corporation. Workers made an application to the South Essex Waterworks Co., Romford, in April, for a minimum wage of  4 per week, which was refused. The company offered to increase the stokers&apos; existing rate of 57s. by 7s. 6c?., but the union refused to accept this. The company have, however, been paying the increased rate, and are not prepared to increase it, as the Joint Industrial Council for the industry have the question of wages under consideration. The secretary of the company has, however, agreed to submit any finding of the Industrial Court on the Metropolitan Water Board arbitration to his Board for consideration. By the intervention of the Chief Concilation Officer the union have agreed to defer any drastic action until after the award of the Industrial Court has been considered by the company, and have promised to inform him before any further step is taken.Boot Last Makers (Midlands). A strike is threatened in the boot last manufacturing industry in Leicester, Northampton and Kettering, as a^result of the refusal by the employers of a claim for an advance in wages of  1 for men, 10s. for youths, and a 33 3 per cent, advance on piece-rates. The employers contend that owing to the present state of the boot and shoe trade, no advance can be granted at present. The Chief Conciliation Officer, Birmingham, has suggested to the chairman of the employers&apos; association that a conference might be arranged between representatives of employers and operatives.Clogmakers (Snaith). A strike of clogmakers occurred on the 23rd June at the works of the Snaith Clog Sole Manufacturing Co., Ltd., following a refusal of the firm to grant the increase to their workers demanded by the Workers&apos; Union. Attempts by the Chief Conciliation Officer to secure a settlement by conciliation have so far failed as the firm&apos;s offer of 15 per cent, advance to all machinists, and an extension of the bonus scheme to labourers and women, has been rejected by the operatives.Button Makers and Piece-Work (London). The Workers&apos; Union notified the depart-ment that their members in the button department of the Premier Sewing Cotton Co., Bishopsgate, had ceased work as a protest against the introduction of a piece-rate system. Arrangements were made for representatives of both parties to meet an officer of the department to discuss the reinstatement of the workpeople concerned.  The firm statedquestions pending and miscellaneous.* See this Report, Vol. II, No. 3,17th July, p. 99.Union should be taken off the job. This the latter refused to allow, and continued to work on the job, in spite of the managements orders to the contrary. Consequently the members of the craft unions considered they had been tricked, and came out on strike. Mr. Justice Lawrence held that the trouble was due to the disobedience of the four men, and that neither Fisher nor any other of the shop stewards caused the strike. He held that the defendants had no power to call a strike, and that they did not combine or conspire to threaten, intimidate or coerce the employers into dismissing or suspending the plaintiff, and he gave judgment accordingly as above.
Gas Workers (National). The workers who at various centres refused to accept the terms of the national settlement and struck work, have been induced by their leaders, after great difficulty, to return to work. The Bristol men were the last to arrive at this decision on the 16th July. The terms generally on which work has been resumed are that the men&apos;s claims are to be dealt with by the Regional Gas Councils, but at Hudders-&apos; field the Gas Committee have agreed to recommend to the National Gas Council that the additional 4s. per week be granted.Shop Assistants (Newcastle-on-Tyne). The National Amalgamated Union of Shop Assistants, Warehousemen and Clerks approached three firms in Newcastle to negotiate their national minimum wage scale, but were met with refusals in each case. The union asked the department to intervene, but after inquiries the Chief Conciliation Officer informed the union that the matter was one for mutual arrangement. The unicn&apos;s position is too weak for a strike.Bleachers (Arbroath). The Arbroath Mill, Factory and Bleachfield Workers&apos; Union have made an application to the owners&apos; association for an increase of 30 per cent, on existing rates. This has been refused. The Chief Conciliation Officer has been asked to make inquiries into the matter.Glass Workers (Alloa). This dispute still continues*. The Chief Conciliation Officer has again endeavoured to arrange a joint conference, but the attitude of the managing director of the firm is the same as formerly. He states that he is not prepared to accept the workpeople back under conditions other than those offered in April, and that he does not consider the men are now in the company&apos;s employment. As the works are closing down for holidays no further action is being taken on either side at present, but efforts to effect a settlement will be renewed in August.Glaziers and Building Trade Rates (London). An application, made by the operative glaziers&apos; society to the London Glaziers&apos; Employers&apos; Federation for building trade rates for their members of 2s. 4dL and 2s. per hour, against Is. ll^d. and Is. 9d. which have been paid since the 1st May, was refused by the federation at a meeting on the 8th July. It is understood that glaziers working direct for builders are paid builders&apos; rates. A strike is threatened.  The Chief Conciliation Officer, London, is in touch with the parties.Corporation Workers (Sheffield). An opportunity appears to have arisen by which the intervention of the department may be able to secure a settlement of this long disputef between the Corporation and the building trades federation, and Mr. McKerrell has gone to Sheffield to see whether he can bring the parties together and secure at least a reference to arbitration to a Court acceptable to both sides.Lighting Engineers (London). The National Warehouse and General Workers&apos; Union inquired when arrangements would be made for the arbitration proceedings to be held in this case-J In view of the fact that the firms had withdrawn their consent to go to arbi-tration the point was put to the Solicitor as to whether the fact that the two parties had signed a form consenting to arbitration imposed a legal obligation on them to proceed, and on the department to refer the case to arbitration, or whether either party might* See this Report, No. 13, 24th April, p. 446.j See this Report, No. 22, 26th June, p. 789. (b 16290)% See this Report, Vol. II, No. 2, p. 78.Ythat they were prepared to dismiss the new workers who had been taken on during the strike and to reinstate in a week&apos;s time all the members of the union for whom work could be provided. The union representatives desired to put the firm&apos;s offer before their members and to inform the department of their decision. The firm reported later that they have decided to close down for a fortnight. They will re-open after August Bank holiday and will be ready to engage any workpeople, without discrimination in regard to their being members of a trade union.Blouse and Underclothing Makers (Glasgow). It is reported by the Chief Conciliation Officer, Glasgow, that a dispute exists at the blouse and underclothing factory of Messrs. Rattray &amp; Co., Glasgow. The dispute arose on account of the refusal of certain workers to join the United Garment Workers&apos; Trade Union and the secession from the union of certain other workers. Negotiations have been opened up between the parties by the Chief Conciliation Officer, but no settlement has as yet been reached. The local secretary of the union stated that he did not intend to advise the girls to resume work until he saw what occurred after the July holidays.
Wages and Arbitration Department-continued,withdraw from the arbitration proceedings, if they so desired. The Solicitors opinion is that the Minister is not legally bound to refer a matter for settlement as the words of the Industrial Courts Act are &quot; may refer,&quot; not &quot; shall refer.&quot;Request for&apos; Re-hearing Refused. The Industrial Court recently issued an award, in a case in which the Admiralty was one of the parties to the reference, under which the claim of a certain grade of workman was disallowed. One of the unions representing these workmen asked the Admiralty if that department would agree to a re-hearing of this particular claim, on the ground that their case had been inadequately put owing to the tact that no representative of the union was present though the federation to which the union is affiliated was duly represented. The Admiralty replied that they would raise&apos;no objection. After consideration of all the circumstances this department informed the parties that the Minister was not prepared to re-open the case. The Admiralty have agreed, in future, to consult, this department before giving countenance to similar pro-posals.Stoneware Conciliation Board (Scotland).&apos; Negotiations are proceeding between the Potters&apos; Federation, Ltd., and the National Society of Pottery Workers with a view to reviving the Scottish Stoneware Conciliation Board, which was dissolved in June, 1915. In the suggested rules for the new Board, it is proposed that the chairman of the Board shall be a neutral chairman nominated by the local Ministry of Labour representatives. The parties have been informed, however, that the department cannot agree to this proposal, but are prepared to assist in any way possible the nomination of a chairman from the Ministry&apos;s panel.[Reference to matters of interest in connection with Wages and Arbitration will be found also on pages 132 to 138 and 154 to 160.]
APPENDIX.questions in parliament.The following extracts from the Official Report of the proceedings of the House of Commons relate to questions in which the Ministry is interested.Ex-Service Men&apos;s Training Allowances.Major Barnes asked the Minister of Labour if he is aware that many of the soldiers in training at Birtley, near Newcastle-on-Tyne, say that the allowance for the support of themselves and their families is entirely inadequate ; if he will make inquiries ; if he is satisfied that the statements are correct; and if he will take steps to supplement the allowances in such cases as would be reasonable ?Dr. Macnamara: I am aware that there is dissatisfaction with the present rate of training allowances, and I have laid the facts before my colleagues. I regret that I am not yet in a position to announce a decision. (12th July.)Boot and Shoe Repairing Trade Board.Mr. W. R. Smith asked the Minister of Labour whether he has appointed any inspectors,, male or female, to insure the proper observance of the decisions of the Trade Board in connection with boot and shoe repairing ;. if so, how many and at what salary ; and can he say when the towns will be visited from which complaints are arising that employers are evading the agreed awards.Dr. Macnamara: In accordance wi h a decision which was announced in reply to a question asked by my hon. friend the Member for Kingswinford on the 17th March, it is not proposed to add to the number of special officers for non-compliance inspection under the Trade Boards Acts. Inspection under all Acts for the administration of which the Ministry of Labour is responsible is being carried out by one staff of inspectors distributed throughout the country, and the training of these for Trade Boards inspection is being pressed on. 377 visits have been paid to boot and shoe repairing establishments since the minimum rates came into force. 169 complaints have been received, and of these 141 cases have been or are being dealt with by the local inspectors. My hon. friend may be assured that every case will have been investigated in the near future. (12th July.)Catering: Trade Boards.Brigadier-General Surtees asked the Minister of Labour whether, having regard to the conditions under which the office staff and servants in certain large hotels live, he will say if he has yet seen his way to apply the Trade Boards Acts to the catering trade ; and, if not, when he expects to be able to do so.Dr. Macnamara : I have caused inquiries to be made with a view to the establishment of Trade Boards to cover workpeople engaged in catering, and discussions on the point are proceeding between the Labour Ministry and representatives of the employers and workpeople concerned. As my hon. and gallant friend is no doubt aware, there are con-siderahle variations in the conditions of the different branches of catering, and the problems of definition and demarcation are very complex. We are proposing almost immediately to circulate to the employers&apos; associations and trade unions concerned, for their observa-tions, definite proposals for the appointment of separate Trade Boards for: (a) The Light Refreshment and Dining Room Trade;(b) The Hotel, Boarding House and Restaurant Trade ; and(c) The Public-House Trade.I regret that I am unable to state definitely when it will be possible to establish the Trade Boards, but I can assure my hon. and gallant friend that the matter is receiving urgent attention. (14&amp;h July.)
/Appendix- continued. Apprenticeship.Brigadier-General Surtees asked the Minister of Labour if he can give the number of demobilised service men who have been refused work or have been discharged because they have not served the five or seven years&apos;, apprenticeship customary in the trade in question ; and to what city, country and trade is such prohibition most in evidence.Dr. Macnamara: If my hon. and gallant friend has in mind the case of the lad whose apprenticeship was interrupted by the war, that case, I think, is fairly well covered. Over 38,000 such apprenticeships have been or are being completed under conditions consistent with the fact that the person concerned is no longer in his teens. If my hon. and gallant friend means that ex-Service men who might have been apprenticed, but who were not apprenticed because of the war, are not allowed to sign on as skilled men, that is, of course, true. Their case is, however, intended to be met by the power given to the Ministry of Labour to train fit men who, on account of joining the Forces at an early age, did not enter upon an apprenticeship to a skilled trade. About 1,000 have been so trained. The great bulk, I imagine, however, of fit ex-Service men now unemployed are unskilled, and there is, of course, particular difficulty in fitting these men into employment. We are giving close consideration to this problem, the solution of which, as my hon. and gallant friend will at once see, is not easy to find. (15th July.)
