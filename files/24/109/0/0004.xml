A commissar is reported to have stated that British civilians would shortly be

The Allied Governments are masters of the situation in the NEAR MoT if, in complete harmony among themselves, they employ all their forces to carry out a policy&apos; soberly proportioned to their interests.  He will not talk of Greek troops, or French troops or British troops, for him they are all &quot;Allied troops.&quot;Admiral fle i.OBEOK.36. 6* 2fl. &quot;Our French Allies may at any time decide that a policy of compromise is more in accordance with their interests.   They nave been in communication with MUSTAPE: BMaL and have made an armistice   with him in CILICIA. If they controlled CONSTANTINOPLE they would be in a position to bring in a Nationalist Government, which would create a situation making executionof the present Peace Treaty impossible&quot;.Adrnmil de ROB^GK. 23n 6, 20.    &quot;The relations which exist between Italians and Nationalists are of so equivocal a nature and the frequent visits of Italian officers and others to Nationalist leaders in ANATOLIA are so openly directed against the common interests of the Allies that, from a purely military point of view, the presence of.Italian troops in the ISMID area might constitute a grave danger to our forces by transmission to the enemy of military information&apos;.Mm PENINSULAf M^QRA and the STRAIT Sourse of events.26, 6, 20.   The raid on CONSTANTINOPLE from the direction of ISMID which was contemplated by the Nationalists was held up by a locral anti-Nationalist rising.   The situation was also eased by movements of Nationalist forces south towards ALASHEHR to meet the Greek threat to that place. at CHANAK and in the ISmID PENINSULA all was aiiet, no military movements having been reported since tho 22nd inskip.

The following movements by rail of Nationalist troops were reported:-  one-division moving from&apos;the N. and two divisions moving from KONIA towards ALASIiEHtf,&apos; the intention  evidently being to concentrate on that place,.27. 6* 20. The front remains ouiet.     Reports from oar liaison officers showed that the Greeks had bohavod well in battle and towards the inhabitants and thoro rjad been no regrettable occurrences.The Greek General IOiiNNU in his advance N. spread prcpagtada to the effect that the torritoty he was occupying.-would remain Greek.    The Greek High Commissioner and General PA3AS&amp;EV0.-QULOS have disclaimed these statements and agree that the occupation is only a temporary military measure taken at the instance of the Supreme Council.General PAHiSKEYO^OULOS at this time contemplated a surprise  landing at giYPJMA about the 2nd or 3rd July to synchro-nise with the advance from the 8. ana asked for a regiment of the Greek division promised to General iilLNS to be sent to MUD^OS; this regiment, with another, to constitute the landing force-. He asked also for naval assistance with craft for the landing and for the presence of a battleship when it took place.28. 6. 20. General PAi^SKEVOPOULOS was informed that he could expect the concentration at MUIM)S to be completed by noon on the 30th and that landing operations could commence on trie 1st July, by which date he expected to have Bi,LIK:&apos;.-SiiI.   The advance on BALIKaSiil was ordered for the 29th,29. 6. 20. General ^u^SK-OYOPOULOS accompanied, by his BY.,, and by General BBIDG2S arrived at KIPiKAGACH., KLUSUN was taken.Greek information pointed to the reinforcing of the Nationalists at BaLIKESBI from the direction of BHJS;. and PaNDIMA.30. 6. 20.

The Greeks took 1.200 pri-soners out of a garrison of 4,000 and captured large quantities of material, including 56 guns without breech Vlocks and 20 machine guns.2. 7, 20.   General PAr&amp;SKSVOPOULOS urged upon General MILNE that to annihilate the enemy and ensure railway&quot;communication between SMYRNA and D&apos;;ND?:^A the occupation of MJSA is indispensable.
General MILNE replied that he could make no remarks as he was no longer in command of the Allied Forces in ASIA MINOR,1. 7. 20.    A summary of events from General bridges under thisiers:extremely satisfactory and the behaviour .of the Greek troops had been admirable.General IOANNOU had returned to MANISA.There had been much talk of an advance on BRUSA but the Greek High Commissioner and General PARASKS70P0UL0S had discountenanced this, considering the zohe of operations should not be oitended except by request of the Supreme Council.28. 6. 20.   Situation unchanged.23. 6, 2J.   The Greek Government have abandoned the idea of occupying E. iHRACE until the conclusion of the operations in ASIA&apos;MINOR.     They appear to be nervous as to possible action by BULGARIa, who, they say, has not disarmed and has available 50,000 men.The Greek Government state they have information that the Turks have established machine guns and an observation post on the SULTAN SELEi M0S,UE at AB$IAN0PLS.   The ulterior object is to accuse the Greeks of desecration.8, 6. 20.    The military preparations of JiiPPBR JBAYAR continue. Trenches and artillery emnlcements have been constructed on a line running from near ADRIAN OPUS to P^VLOKLTI on the ERGalE river, while the I. Army Corns seem to have made defensive preparations on the left bank of the lower course of that river. JaFPER&apos;TAYARf S strength is.variously estimated.   The minimum estimate gives him 15,000 men, the maximum estimate 45,000.   He is short of artillery and has little or no motor transport,  Eis medical equipment is inadequate.   It therefore seems probable that any campaign which may take place in Turkish THRACE will speedily degenerate into a guerilla war,iMEIIA.1.8885 of 28.6.20.

The Khediial Steamshin Line have now (May 7th) arranged u provisional itinerary for three months between SUEZ and PORT SUDAN, calling at W3JH and YiiNBO.King HUSSEIN has given a private promise that he will look on the Khedivial Line as the HASHIMTTE Government Line; that is to say, he will have all cargoes and passengers sent by that line in preference to any other.   He has also admitted the right to special consideration of the firm of GELLATLY HaNKEY, owing to their long connection - 50 years - with JEDDaH, and thoir great help to his government during the war,&apos;The Italian Consul at JSDDAH, IL CAVALIERA BERNABI, however, is working very hard ib arrange a RED SEA Italian shipping service to trade between all the small ports.   He is also in close communication with the King over the nrojected sale of two Italian coasting steamers to the HASHIMIIE Government. This deal is not concluded, however, and it would appear quite likely that it never will be if the Khedivial Line continue their present satisfactory arrangements.In their last two trips, besides 400 pilgrims, there has been a very large srargo for Y-NBO, and it is very apparent that now is the time for manufacture ref of GREAT BSITIiiN to get&apos; the trade of the EEJAZ into their hands.   If this is not done now, JAPAN and AMERICA will got it from us. At MASSOW4H and DJIBOUTI ?.s well as in manv ports on the Arabian coast, Japanese goods are in great demand, But this trade could easily be recaptured if steps ate taken at once to this end.Arms Traffic. In connection with the report of th  anticipated attempt to send 250,000 rifles to EGYPT from SPAIN via ITALY, from further information received (May 28th) it is stated -that the arms would not be, or have not been, landed at an Egyptian oort, but that tney would be taken across the border by land route. Presumably this refers to the EGYPT-SUDAN border.It is reported that the sale of a ship to King HUSSEIN by the French may be broached by IBN AZUZ, who is still in MECCA.
