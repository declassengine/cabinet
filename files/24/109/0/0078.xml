Memorandum presented by the secretary-General, League of flfatisas.(Circulated for information)1*   Reasons for immediate consideration.It appears desirable for the following reasons that the -question of the preparations required to enable the League to use, if necessity arises, the weapon of International economic and financial blockade contemplated in article 16 of the Treaty should be considered by the Council, and, on reference from the Council, by the first assembly of the League.(a) The use of this weapon is in certain circumstances a specific duty Imposed by article 16.   This duty cannot be effectively carried out without great loss of time and efficiency unless there has been considerable previous preparationbefore the time at which action is required.(b) Situations might well arise in which the knowledge that the weapon is ready for use would hare a very salutary effect.(c) Many people think that the League is founded moreupon good intentions than upon a cool oan^consideration of the stern realities of international trouble.   It is, therefore, desirable tn general grounds that while the first meetings of the Council and of the iissembly should give the world the positive hope of removing misunderstandings and promoting international co-operation, they should also show quite clearly that the Members of the League as a whole are determined, if necessity arises, to enforce their will by effective action on any particular country which in the circumstances contemplated by the Covenant defies the general verdict of the world.2,   The Provisions of the Treaty.The relevant article of the Treaty (15) runs as follows1: -ARTICLE 16.&quot;Should any Member of the League resort to war in disregard of its Covenants under article 12, 13 or 15 it shall ipso facto be deemed to have committed an act of war against all other Members of the League which hereby undertake immediately to subject It to the severance of all trade or financial relations ... and the prevention of all financial, commercial or personal intercourse between the nationals of the covenant-breaking State and the nationals of any other i;tate whether a ^mber of the League or not.&quot;It shall be the duty of the Council in such cases to recommend to the several Governments concerned whateffective(^OIT^IDEIITIAI,.

effective military or naval forces the Members ef tho League shall severally. oontrVbute to .the armed forces to be used to prcteot the Covenants of the League.&quot;The Members of the League agree further thay they will mutually support one another in the financial and eoonomic meausres which are taken under this Article in.trier tt minimise the&quot; loss and inconvenience resulting from the above measures.17The fe&amp;lewing conclusions appear to emerge from the aobve provisions:-fa)   The economic weapon, is to be used against a country which has already been deemed to have committed&apos;an act of war against all ather lumbers of the League.   It should be noted, however, that under Article 11 wAny war wr threat of war ... is hereby declared a matter of concern to the whole League and the League shall take any action that may be deemed wise and effectual to safeguard the peace oi nations&quot;; that under Article 13, when a dispute has been referred to Arbitration and there is a failure tQ carry out the award, &quot; the Council shall propose what steps should be taken to give effect tbersfet,rt. and under Article&apos; 17, in the event of &quot;a dispute between a Member and a non-Member of the League, the non-Member is to be invited to accept the obligations of membership for the purpose&apos;of the dispute, and if it refuses and resorts to war against the Member Trthe previsions of Article 16 shall be applicable as against the State taking such action.17   In. all these cases therefore the eeen&amp;mlo weapon will, or may be, used.-(b) The aeostoolt weapon is not the only means of pressure which the  eague. may use; it may also recommend to the several Members a contribution of military or naval forces for the protection of the Covenents of the League.\fo)   There is, however, one important&quot; difference between the tine forms of pressure.   JWhere a Member of the League resorts to war in disregard of specified Cevenants, all other Members1 of the League are by the Covenant itself specifically obliged to apply/the&apos;economic weapon.   They are not similarly obliged to use their military or naval forces.   In the latter case, the Article, only&apos;provides that it shall be the duty of the Council in suen cases to recommend W&apos;the&apos; several Governments concerned what effective military oy naval forces they shall severally contribute. -(d)   The article clearly contemplates that so far as possible-the responsibility for enforcing economic pressure shall be decentralised, i.e., a primary responsibility rests upon each Government to take actltn so far as its own nationals and own national machinery are concerned, arrangements being made by each of them separately and not by a single international authority.z0   Why Aotion is required by: tfte. Central Authority of-the League.At the same time it appears to be clear that a central co-crdinating authority will be required if the-weapon is to be effectively and efficiently used, for the following reasons:-(ft)    The Article requires action.to be taken to prevent States which are not Members of the League (and on whom, therefore,, no responsibility rests under the Treaty) from trading with the offending State,   It clearly requires--co-operative aotion on the part of the Members of the League to give effect to this provision.
^4.  :Proposed Appolatment of International Blockade Commission.   &quot; *   &quot;-As a prelirainary measure, it: is suggested. that an ,Internatioa al Blockade Commission should be appointed under.the authority of the &quot;first assembly for&apos;the purpose.&apos; of..&apos;studying the problem and settling the -general; plan-ef action/, the:.&apos; organisation of the more permanent machinery required and the,principles on&apos;which it should work.... The. C ommiss ion - mi ght - pe rhap s. atfirst c onsls t of repre sent a-&apos; tives nominated- fey the Countries.entitled, to permanent&apos; &apos; -membership on the Council of the League, with, the addition.of representatives of -four other lumbers of the League selected &quot;by the Assembly.   Other Members ot the&apos; League might, be. invited &quot;to send representative s to sit on the Commission during; the -discussion of --quest ions directly, affecting, their&apos;interests.2, Whitehall Gardens, .*a.Vul &apos; -July-33rd, 1920.(b)   The action of an individual national Government would doubtless be in many respects assisted by a knowledge of the aotion which other government -^Mtended to take in execution of their duty under the Article.&apos;  General uniformity in the legislative and administrative provisions of the  . different states would be of great assistance to eatfn particular Government \n defending its action to its own national commercial interests which&apos;are affected.   The sense both of justice and unity of effort would be Increased, and the general International blockade would be more efficient. To secure&apos; this end, however;, preliminary. work of co-ordination . is obviously required.(c)   Co-operative action is al*o required in order to give effect to the provision that Members of-the League will &quot;mutually support one another in ;the financial and economic measures which are taken in order to &quot;minimise the&apos; loss and Inconvenience&quot; resulting from the blockade., This ,last problem is often likely to prove very complicated..
