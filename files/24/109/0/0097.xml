THE RUSSIAN SITUATION.-memorandum by the Presidentf Board, of Education.My Colleagues may be interested to learn the substance of a conversation which I had last Sunday with Mr.Bert rand uussell,, the eminent Mathematician and Philosopher,. who has just returned from a visit to Russia.- Mr. rnissell**who suffered for his Pacifist opinions during the ;,ar and went to Russia   inclined to sympathise, with the Bel&amp;hevik vioverninent, has returned from that Country profoundly Impressed with the defects of the Bolshevik leaders., with the tyranny of their rule, and with the deplorable economic state of the great iiussiah Cities.   His testimony la valuable as that of the first foreigner of real intellectual eminence who r has visited Russia since the Revolution and I, therefore, make no apology in communicating to my Colleagues the substance of his rep-ortI should add that though Mr. Russell knaws no Russian, he f^und that Lenin and 1&apos;rotsky and all the important uoviet leaders could speak either irehohj English, er German,,.languages in which Mr. Russell, is proficient.   He was five weeks in the country and conversed with men of every shade of political opinion.the Government of nussia, he reports, is in the hands of th*Communists, who number in all about 600,000.   Their rule ispractically uno^ntest^L,., there are no small local revolts against it of which we in England have never heard, and the will of theGovernment is effectively communicatyd to every part of the Empire,.I particularly asked,Hr.Russell whether the Government in Moscow could control the operations of its agents in Persia and in Indian   He replied that they could turn the tap of propagandaon and off at will and that thoir agencies for the diffusion o.f Bolshevik propaganda in the i.ast, and especially in India, were already powerful and likely to become extre/nely formidable unless steps were promptly take to enforce upon the Russian Sovern-ment a policy of non-intervention.This
This highly centralised Government professes a Communist pM.3osor!:Ay w.n 3ch it has found increasingly difficult to apply outside the area of the great towns *    On the whole the effect of the Revolution has been to increase the number of peasant proprietors and to strengthen the principle of economic individualism as against the principle of Communism In the country at large.     In the towns, however, the control of the Bolshevik Government over persons and things is supreme,. You cannot change your Hotel without leave of the Police, your room Is assigned to you by the Police, and all your movements are controlled by the Police *    At the head of the Communist State is Lenin - a fanatical visionary with the temperament of a Byzantine Monk, laborlousP abstemious^ inhuman, not of any exceptional ability, (Mra Russell thought that Trotsky was really a much abler man), but possessing an extraordinary ascendancy Over the whole Country.I was a little surprised to find how highly Mr. Russell was inclined to rate the personal position of Lenin^    His view was that Lenin towered over Trotsky and all the other members of the Soviet and that there was no question of challenging his authorityc    On the side of Economics Lenin swallows Marx whole,, and will not admit any criticisms of his doctrine,, which he takes as a revelation of ultimate truth*     He knows very little about England, but otherwise seemed to understand the weights and measures of Europe pretty well*    He cares more about the Cosmopolitan Revolution than about anything else, but is sensible enough to realise that Russia needs Peace and that it may be necessary to abandon propaganda to get ito. Side by side with this strong.current of International Communism in the Russian Government there is also a feebler current of Nationalism^,     Trotsky has a good deal of Nationalist sentiment and in the country at large patriotic fervour has been greatly stirred by the Polish invasion, which has had the effect of immensely strengthening the Bolshevik
Government in RussianI asked M^a Russell whether he thought that the Soviet Government would ever acquiesce in the loss of Reval or in the independence of the little States of Lithuania, Latviaj , Esthonla, etc. which had been carved out of the body of Imperial Russia,    fee answered that he believed that they Were quite prepared to accept the existence and Independence of these States, and moreover would raise no objection to the existence of an independent Poland containing the old Province of Russian Poland, because they took the view that these small States would necessarily be penetrated by Russian influence and if ever they became troublesome could easily be swallowed lip by their powerful neighbour*The economic condition of Petrograd and Moscow impressed Mr. Russell, in common with all visitors to Russia, as deplorable. No unskilled labourer in this Country would consent to live upon the dietary which Is supplied to the majority of the population.     On the other hand, the country side struck him as being remarkably prosperous and there was nothing on the long journey between Moscow and Astrakhan which appeared to  . denote the political convulsions which the Russian State has so recently experienced.     His general Impression was that the War had in reality done very little to impair the inexhaustible resources and energy of the Russian people and that they might very easily become a most formidable danger to the whole fabric of European Society if they once get on the move0    A speedy peace with Russia was accordingly greatly to be desired.     The present Soviet Government., however disagreeable and tyrannical was active, laborious, able and temperate..    The use of Vodka was rare., and&apos;tha vi^tor!ies Of the Reds over the Whites weire not a little due to their superiority in tho matter of temperance 0-    The lower ranks of the Civil Service were mainly Jewislu    Mr* Russell could see no effective party of opposition which could take the place of the present Government;   and though its tenets were not shared by the peasantry and were bitterlyhostile to the Church, It was nevertheless able to conscript the peasants for, its Army without opposition and to call into its service the eld Imperialist Generals0     So far therewere
were no Germansj either in the Russian Armies or in the Russian Civil Service.    The Armies wore growing more power-ful day by day and the general military administration was becoming more and more efficient.    The Government was putting all its energy into the preelection of the War and the trans-port system of tho country was almost entirely employed in bringing troops and munitions to the Front..    As the War pro-ceedod the Government became stronger and stronger ana the only chanco of ending the rule of the Bolsheviks lay in thesottlement of a general peace.     If the Red Armies wore onco allowed to overrun Poland they wore quite strong enough to set-all Germany aflame and to bring the fabric of civilisation in central Europe to the ground.I asked I:r. Russell how far the system of Te^aborismwas still continued.     He said that it haeli been very muchrelaxed in recent months, but that the Bolshevik Government admitted themselves to 8,000 shootings after a secret trial by the Revolutionary Commission and justified them as necessary to the foundation of their rule.In general, his opinion was that the Government of the - Communist Party would certainly last a few more years but that its philosophy would be inevitably transformed by the pressure of facts and by the daily tasks of administration.   He was not   &apos; of opinion that a military Coup dretatwas likely in the near future, partly because the Czaiist Generals wore very closely watched by Bolshevik Commissaries and partly because a good number- of new Officers and Generals of Communist principles had emerged during the recent camp aigns.Finally, he took the view that by reason of our interests in the East we. had a special ground for coming to terms with the Government in Moscow which was not shared by Our Allies, the French-   In a word, the Soviet Government could do us a great deal of injury.     Our power of retaliation:. through/
through the BACofcrAo did not amount to very muoh and sinco there was no prospect of our being able to overthrow the Russian Government in Moscow by force of arms we had much better recognise the facts and come to t&quot;.3rmso(3d. ) H*iL*Ii* FI.cjHSR*Board of Education. S*W.26th. July, 1320.
