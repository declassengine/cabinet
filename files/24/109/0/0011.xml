Up to the present the Reparation commission has not fixed these deliveries. The German Government has so far only received lists of claims from the Allied states for purposes of observation.   These lists which contain anything from ere, coal of every description, raw material, industrial produces, to entire factory plants, have been submitted to a close examination which is practically completed so that negotiations with the Reparation Commission could begin in the near future.   During these negotiations it will have to be decided, in view of Germany&apos;s capabilities, which deliveries can be definitely demanded, and which deliveries in view of Germany&apos;s economic position, especially the lack of raw material, cannot be executed, either totally or in part.B.In order to ensure a quick and peaceful execution of these deliveries the following plan appears suitable(1) Germany is creating a comprehensive organisation of her entire industry including manual labour in order to effect the deliveries. The organisation is of a dual nature.devastated areas of the Allied and Associated Powers.   This
(a) In cases.in - which the demands refer to special.&apos;&quot;material, which is principally.manufactured byengineering and kindred v/orks (Gross-industrie ),the distribution is effected through the trade ... kassociations of the particular industry.(b) $hen it is $ question of wholesale articles (so-called &quot;Catalogue goods&apos;1), for the manufactureof which manual labour and the smaller industries take part, the deliveries are distributed by a clearing house over the various countries of the Empijbe-.&apos;  The countries parcel out the deliveries through special Contract Boards among the industries and hand workers. Both the provinces and the trade associations are nominated as Executive Unions under the Law for the Execution of the peace Treaty of August 31, 1919 (official Gazette p.l53o).   As such they can if necessary be. compelled by force to. produce the output demanded.   Moreover, they both under-take the responsibility for the actual   execution.(2) Deliveries in kind are to be reckoned at prices current on the world marketp so that the contract Boards and Trade Associations might be able to cope adequately with the orders. The extent and manner in which the orders are to be booked, will be decided en when the reparation debt is settled.x   The list of the Trade Associations already in existence is contained in the statement of the organisation of the Imperial Union of German Industry which is attached hereto as an annex.xx   These contract Boards Have been constituted or are in course of organisation in Prussia, where branch offices for the various provinces will be established, and also in Bavaria, saxony, v/urtteiaberg, Baden, Hesse, Thuringen and in ths Hansa Towns.
(3) Tlw -special xKt^derc Will, bfF^negtrt^&amp;ted and put ftxrwan?,,, between the organisations and Unions of cc^rtJJatfUrr&amp;^ppointed for the purpose of distribution on the one hand, and the person who has suffered.damage or his representative organisation on the other hand, by the distributive organisation created by G-erraan industrial manufacturers for the purposes of reparation/ The   iiannertin which the various Trade Associations and Govern-ment .qrgnai sat ions are to co-operate with the authorities and the various Associations interested in the countries where damage occurred, will have to be settled more exactly.(4) Jt is to be recommended that each Allied and Associated power should create a two-fold organisation, one having as its object the examination of.the demands, and&apos; the other the recep-tion of deliveries.(a) The former organisation will become necessary because the lists include a very large number of claims for damage presented within the dates appointed in orderto avoid foreclosure, but subsequently settled by means *f direct pffders on the part of the persons who sus-.  tained damage, which orders were placed in Germany and settled by drawing upon the reparations account of the Allied Governments.(b) The task of the second organisation will be finally to take delivery of the goods, etc., supplied and to assume responsibility for any deficiencies.(5) All organisations concerned shall be developed on a basis of absolute co-operative parity between employer andemployed.(6) Special preventive measures are to be devised for the purpose of preventing abuses which are liable to creep in when private businesses are officially controlled.ff   The distributing organisation is already in existence. Its address is 8, Gutleutstrasse, Frankfurt a/M.
/   A list of members could be presented at once by the German Delegation..SPA,11th July, 192Q.(7) Examination of this plan and. its. execution shall be entrusted to a commission of Experts^, which shall if necessary include representatives of the Government,   sub-commissions   , shall be affiliated to this Commission, for various categories of goods.   The Commission shall commence its functions immediately.
