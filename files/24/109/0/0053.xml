PART L-THE LABOUR SITUATION.THE GENERAL SITUATION.General Survey of the Week.The most disturbing feature of the week has been the widespread series of unofficial strikes of gas workers against the recent settlement arranged by the Joint Industrial Council for the industry. This series of strikes may be compared with the similar series of tramway strikes at Easter. &quot; In each case their occurrence may perhaps be attributed to the exceptionally difficult position in. the wage negotiations of statutory undertakings. The question of national as against regional rates of pay is also involved.An important settlement has been reached concerning the wages of Scottish building trade operatives, and one result of this settlement is the termination of the carpenters&apos; and joiners&apos; strike which began on the 10th May. The position in the printing trades, with regard to provincial compositors, continues to be difficult, and critical negotiations are taking place in the road transport industry and the woollen and worsted industry.The Award of the Industrial Court for the engineering and shipbuilding trades is expected to be made public on the 16th July, and it may be judged that the most important developments of the industrial situation within the next few weeks will be with regard to this industry and the coal-mining industry.The. annual conferences of the National Union of Eailwaymen and the Miners&apos; Federa-tion of Great Britain have now been concluded. Both conferences have had to deal with wages demands which affect the Government and with Government schemes for the future control of the industry. The railwaymen accepted the recent wages Award and showed themselves favourable to the Ministry, of Transport^ scheme. On the other hand the miners have put in a double demand, for increased wages and reduced prices, and have declared a most determined opposition to the Ministry of Mines Bill.The special meeting of the Trades Union Congress is dealt with below. The annual meeting of the Trades Union Congress on the 6th September will be perhaps more important than .the series of conferences just concluded, but until that date there is a period of comparative freedom from conferences.The House of Commons concluded the Eeport stage of the Unemployment Insurance Bill on the 9th July. The Women, Young Persons, and Children (Employment) Bill has passed through the Standing Committee.The Unemployment Position.The number of H.M. Forces and Merchant Seamen out-of-work donation policies current for the week ending the 2nd July was 163,050, made up of 162,131 lodged by men, and 919 by women. On the 25th June there were 174,224 policies current, 173,243 by men and 981 by women.On the 2nd July, 69,213 unemployment books, 47,972 for males and 21,241 for females, remained lodged by workers under the Unemployment Insurance Acts. Compared with the previous week when there were 46,609 books lodged by males and 20,801 by females, the total increase is l;803.The total live register for all Employment Exchanges on the 2nd July was 235,051 men, 47,262 women and 22,357 juveniles, compared with 242,002 men, 47,138 women and 20,409 juveniles a week ago, and 265,296 men, 45,669 women and 20,952 juveniles a month ago.  A detailed analysis of the unemployment position will be found on page 101.
FEATURES OF THE WEEK.General Topics.Ireland, Russia and Hungary. The most important event of the week in this con-nection is the holding of the special meeting of the Trades Union Congress on the 13th July. In drawing attention to the leading features of the Congress it may first be remarked how definitely the Irish question has assumed the place of first importance. It will be remem-bered that in point of time, the incident of the Jolly George preceded the North &quot;Wall incident, and that the embargo of the National Union of Bail way men on Polish munitions, though re-called when first put to the test, and the embargo of the International Federation of Trade Unions on Hungary both took place about the same time as the North Wall incident. Immediately before the Congress, too, appeared the second interim report of the Labour Delegation to Russia. There were thus at least four important topics which the Trades Union Congress might have discussed, namely Russia, Polish munitions, Hungary and Ireland.The Russian question, as a whole, however, was excluded ori&apos;the plea that the matter was in the hands of a joint body representing the Trades Union Congress and the National Labour Party. The Hungarian question was ignored, and Polish munitions were only incidentally dealt with in one phrase of the miners&apos; resolution. The emergency resolution , on Russia deals only with the decisions of the Spa Conference. These facts are some indication of the deep interest of the British trade unions in Irish affairs, which affect their membership. They also, perhaps, indicate a desire on the part of the leaders of the trade union movement not to invite defeat by dissipating the energies of the movement.With regard to the resolutions actually passed, the principle of the resolution formulated by the National Union of Railway men is that, while the Government are considered respon-sible for the present state of affairs in Ireland, the British trade union movement calls for a truce, and calls upon both sides in Ireland to contribute to the making of that truce. Further, the resolution envisages nothing more than Dominion Home Rule for Ireland. This restriction, and this hint that action, on the part of Sinn Fein as well as of the Govern-ment is necessary, appear to have caused much of the hostility to the resolution. The Congress rejected by considerable majorities resolutions in favour of absolute self-determina-tion and in favour of a plebiscite of the Irish people. The passing of the miners&apos; resolution, which may be coupled with the rejection of Mr. Bromley&apos;s amendment to the railwaymen&apos;s resolution, is an indication that the Congress refuse to sit in judgment on the two parties in Ireland, but, having adopted the policy of truce, prefer to secure the adoption of that policy in Ireland by exerting pressure on^the British Government alone.The course of action which will be adopted now by the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress is not too clear, but it was indicated that the resolutions of the Congress would be put before the Government and that, while the Government considered the resolutions, it would be the duty of every trade union to ballot their members or to take similar steps to ascertain the views&apos;of the rank and file on a strike policy. It does not appear that the Parliamentary Committee will assume the responsibility of inter-preting these ballots, or any replies the Government may make. There will be yet another Congress to review the situation before any drastic action is taken.The British Trades Union Congress in their discussion of the Irish question, by taking into consideration all the political factors involved, have failed to decide the question which was the original cause of their meeting, namely, the refusal of some trade unionists to handle military goods. The Scottish Trades Union. Congress, however, on the 10th July, at Glasgow, called upon the members of the affiliated unions to refuse &quot;to manufacture, handle or transport munitions or troops &quot; intended for use in Ireland.Increase of Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Act, 1920.-The provisions of this Act have been given fair publicity in the daily Press and some of the more popular papers are making an endeavour to explain the more frequent special cases which arise. It may be judged that the various tenants&apos; and property owners&apos; associations are also active. What is needed is that the mass of working class tenants and smaller landlords should grasp the framework of the Act in so far as it affects them, so that the Act may be applied to the bulk of ordinary cases without unnecessary friction. It is also necessary, of course, that a knowledge of the powers of the County Courts with regard to the Act should be widely spread.The movement in favour of resisting any increases of rent affects more particularly the third and fourth of the increases permitted under Section 2, though, by sympathy it may be(B16280) M2
extended to all the permitted increases. This movement continues to be loudly supported. It is reported that the National Union of Ex-Service men have issued a manifesto pro-claiming a &quot; rent-strike &quot; to commence at a date to be announced in due course, while the Glasgow branch of the Scottish Labour Housing Association are promoting similar action. It has also been reported in one quarter that the Parliamentary Committee of the Scottish Trades Union Congress and the Scottish Labour Housing Association have provisionally agreed to call a one-day national strike against the Act, to take place on a Monday in August. Should the first Monday in August be chosen, the result will be a holiday demon-stration rather than a strike. The special meeting of the Scottish Trades Union Congress held in Glasgow on the 10th July, commended the &quot; no-rent &quot; campaign, but no reference was made to a one-day strike. The &quot; no-rent&quot; movement is more likely to materialise than the one-day strike.Employment Exchanges. The Committee of Inquiry resumed their sittings on the 12th July. Evidence was heard from Mr. E. H. C. Wethered, chairman of the Court of Referees for Bristol and district, and chairman of various Trade Boards. He believed that some machinery was necessary for bringing vacancies to the knowledge of the unemployed, and for providing adequate maintenance during the time they were out of employment. He did not consider the provision made by the trade unions sufficient to meet the need. He thought that there were substantial grounds for complaint with the counter staff of the Exchanges, who were frequently inefficient on account of lack of industrial experience. Proper steps should be taken to see that the staff were rightly chosen, that the work at the counter was organised in sections by trades, and that the officer in charge of each section possessed special knowledge of the trade or,group of trades in his charge. The present organisation of the Exchanges, often with one long counter for all comers, skilled and un-skilled, and no privacy for any, seemed to him indefensible. He thought the policy of associating the trade unions, who pay out-of-work benefits, with the administration of the State scheme entirely sound. Evidence was also given by Mr. Owen Parker, president of the Incorporated Federated Association of Boot and Shoe Manufacturers, and by Mr. D. L. Poulton, general secretary of the National Union of Boot and Shoe Operatives. The former expressed the view that Exchanges were of no advantage to any organised industry where employers and employed met frequently on common ground. From his experience on the Kettering Employment Committee, he thought that the Exchanges had served a useful purpose for unorganised labour, and so far as that was concerned, he was not in a position to advise their abolition. Mr. Poulton suggested closer co-operation between Exchanges and trade union officials.On the 13th, evidence was given by Mr. R. R. Robbins,C.B .E., vice-president of the National Farmers&apos; Union, who stated that a majority of farmers had returned an un-favourable report regarding the Exchanges. It was not usual for agricultural labourers to register, and farmers generally obtained their labour by advertising. Exchanges might help the farmers if special rooms were set aside for the use of farmers and farm workers. Mr. T. Macklay, representative of the National Union of Agricultural- Workers, said that the principle of the Exchanges was good, but, generally speaking, both farmers and workmen consulted them only as a last resort. He urged that greater consideration should be given by the Ministry to the places where Exchanges were located, and advocated a simplification of forms and language. He added that his union were determined to break the hiring system. Mr. J. H. Brown, representing the Amalgamated Union of Operative Bakers, Confectioners and Allied Workers, considered that there might be closer co-ordination between the Exchanges and the trade unions.. Mr. S. D. Bianco, president of the London Cabinet and Upholstery Trades Federation, stated that skilled men never made use of the Exchanges.Workmen&apos;s Compensation. The committee under the chairmanship of Mr. Holman Gregory, K.C., M.P., appointed by the Home Secretary in May, 1919, to inquire into the working of the Workmen&apos;s Compensation Act, 1906, have just issued their report. Although they make a number of recommendations which involve a certain measure of State control, the committee consider that the defects of the present Act can be remedied without resort to a State system of accident insurance. The State control would be exercised through an official, to be designated Commissioner, being appointed in one of the departments of State.The committee recommend that the present system be continued subject to the following modifications: (1) The State to supervise insurance companies&apos; premium rates with a view to the.restriction of expenses and of profits in workmen&apos;s compensation business ; not more than 30 per cent, of the
premium income to be expended in profits and management expenses; the maximum rates to be approved or fixed by the Commissioner.(2) Mutual associations to be placed under the same obligations as insurance companies as to setting aside funds to meet outstanding liabilities and as to returns.(3) Every employer other than the Crown, a local or other public authority, a statutory g.c.m.g.-pany, or a householder in respect of servants not employed by him for the purpose of his trade or business, to be required to insure against workmen&apos;s compensation risk.The committee propose that the scope of the Act should be widened to include the following new classes of workers in addition to the 15,000,000 already covered: (a) Persons employed otherwise than by way of manual labour whose remuneration is at a rate not exceeding  350 a year, instead of  250 under the existing Act.(b) Casual employment for the purposes of any game or recreation where the persons employed are engaged or paid through a club.(c) Taxi-cab drivers.(d) Share fishermen employed in the trawler industry;(e) Share fishermen in the herring or other fishery, subject to a formal inquiry by the Commis-sioner into the necessity for their inclusion.(/) All persons ordinarily resident in this country who are employed, or are travelling in the course of their employment, on a British ship.Large increases in amounts of compensation are recommended. At. present the maximum liability in respect of a workman&apos;s death is  300; under the committee&apos;s scheme it is raised to  800.As an experiment it is suggested that the County Court registrars should undertake to give information free of expense to injured workmen or their dependants as to the benefits provided by the Act, and the necessary procedure to protect their rights ; should act as mediators between the employer and the.injured workman or his dependants on request; and should be empowered in the event of a dispute as to the workmen&apos;s con-dition, if both parties assent, to refer the matter to the medical referee whose certificate shall be final.To encourage the provision of safety devices by employers, it is suggested that the Commissioner be empowered to inquire into the practicability of a system of discounts from normal rates in consideration of approved safety provisions.Employers with a wages bill of  20,000 are to be entitled to claim exemption from insurance, provided that the schemes which they provide are not less favourable than the provisions of the Act.The report, which is unanimous, has, however, attached to it a number of memoranda containing reservations by some of the signatories. The more important of these deal, among other,things, with the proposed increase in the maximum weekly compensation, for total incapacity, namely, from. 35s., fixed in January, 1920, to 60s. Four of the sigra-tories, including the Government Actuary, consider that this increase, although a logical result of the increased cost of living, involves serious risks, chiefly from malingering.Messrs. Lever Bros., Ltd. A meeting at Liverpool on the 2nd July of members of the National Warehouse ar:d General Workers&apos; Union carried unanimously a resolution declaring that the bsst interests of trade unionism would be served by the employees of Messrs. Lever Bros., Ltd., and the associated companies withdrawing from the co-partner-ship scheme which the firm have had in operation since 1909.Industrial and other Organisations.Trades Union Congress. The special meeting of the Trades Union. Congress which was determined upon by the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress on the 16th and 17th June, in order that the trade union movement as a whole might define its attitude towards the production ard handling of munitions of war -for use in Ireland and Kussia, met on the 13th July and spent the greater part of the session discussing the Irish question. -Two resolutions were passed, put forward by the National Union of Railwaymen and the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain, respectively.The railwaymen&apos;s resolution was in the following terms :- .&quot; That this Conference of British Trade Unionists is satisfied that the present position in Ireland is such that it demands the immediate consideration of the whole Trade Union movement, and does not warrant any section of the workers being allowed to fight alone a battle for freedom. The Con-ference is satisfied that the present state of Ireland is due (1) to the denial of the British Government
to recognise the claim of the Irish people expressed in a constitutional way for many years, and (2) to the failure ol the British Government to deal with those who defied all law and order and supported open rebellion, and which has resulted in this example being followed by others, with such disastrous results. &apos;&quot;This Conference, therefore, in the name of the organised workers of Great Britain, calls for a truce between all parties, by the Irish people themselves using their power and influence to stop all murder and outrage, and by the Government withdrawing the &apos; Army of Occupation.&apos; , In the event of such a truce as suggested being arranged, the Government to open forthwith an Irish Parliament, with full Dominion powers iri all Irish affairs, with adequate protection for the interests of &apos; minorities.&quot; &apos; &apos;This resolution was carried on a card vote by 1,953,000 votes to 1,759,000.The resolution was proposed and seconded on behalf of the union by Mr. C. T. Cramp and Mr. W. Abraham. Mr. Cramp recommended that the Congress should not commit themselves to any policy, which might ultimately be shown to be entirely impracticable. The membership of his own union was politically divided in Ireland. A reasonable effort must bs made to.adjust the claims of the two sections of their Irish membership, and until that had been done it was unwise to plump down on one side or the other. For this reason they had suggested a truce. Mr. Cramp appealed to the Congress not to go beyond the terms of this resolution.Mr. J. Bromley and Mr. Gill proposed and seconded, on behalf of the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen, an addendum to the resolution which provided that, should the Irish people be unwilling and the Government willing to adopt in principle the suggestion contained in the resolution, then the Congress and its affiliated unions should take no further action in the matter ; but if the Irish people were willing and the Government unwilling, then an immediate ballot should be taken as to a general strike to compel the withdrawal of troops from Ireland. Mr. Simllie, on behalf of the miners, then declared his opposition both to the main resolution and the addendum, on the ground that the Irish people should be given the full right of self-determination. Mr. Bromley&apos;s addendum was defeated on a show of hands.Further amendments moved, on behalf of the Union of Post Office Workers, the National Amalgamated Coal Workers&apos; Union and the Amalgamated Union of Shipbuilding, Engineering and Constructional Workers, and the London Society of Compositors, were then rejected. The post office workers&apos; amendment was the most important, and called simply for the removal of troops and the application of self-determination. It was defeated on a card vote by a majority of 760,000.After the passing of the resolution Mr. Hodges moved, on behalf of the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain, a second resolution in the following terms : &quot; That this Congress protests against the British military domination of Ireland, and demands the withdrawal of all British troops from that country, and demands the cessation of the production of munitions of war destined to be used against Ireland and Russia, and, in case the Government refuses these demands, we recommend a general down-tools policy, and call on all the trade unions here represented to carry out this policy, each according to its own constitution, by taking a ballot ,       of its members or otherwise.&quot;Mr. Hodges claimed that the bed-rock principle of this resolution was hostility to the continued military domination of Ireland by Great Britain. At present they were subject to a military machine and, in the interval before a general election, they could only influence it by the use of working-class industrial organisation. Mr. Ben Tillett seconded the resolution and made the significant declaration that &quot; they might not know what they wanted, but they knew what they did not want.&quot; Mr. J. Mills assured the Congress that no sensible man could think that the resolution meant immediate direct action. Mr. Andrews, National Union of General Workers, and Mr. Dunberry, General Textile Workers&apos; Union, opposed the resolution on the ground that it.meant &quot; direct action.&quot; Mr. Smillie argued that the railwaymen&apos;s resolution contained nothing to move the Govern-ment to take the action desired of it. Labour must show its determination to force that action. The time must come when they would be compelled to take direct action in defence of their own interests.This resolution was carried on a card vote by 2,760,000 votes to 1,636,000.The Congress then proceeded to pass with practical unanimity a resolution on the Unemployment Insurance Bill in the following terms :-&quot; That this Congress declares its emphatic opposition to the Government^ Unemployment Bill, in so far as it makes provision for the administration of unemployment benefits by friendly societies and others.  Further, we instruct the Parliamentary Committee to act in accordance with
the circular issued to the affiliated organisations in March, 1920, and recommend that societies refuse to have anything to do with the Act unless the objectionable clause is removed.&quot;Finally, the Congress, after hearing speeches by Mr. T. Shaw and Miss Margaret Bondfield, passed the following resolution on the subject of Poland and Russia : &quot; That this Congress learns with amazement of the new demand submitted to the Russian Govern -ment before peace negotiations on the terms of the Krassin document are proceeded with. The Conference is heartily in favour of any and all action which may lead to peace in Eastern Europe, and warns the Government and the Spa Conference that any attempt of a clandestine nature to secure the support of the British democracy in order to give military assistance to Poland is fore-doomed to failure. The Conference, therefore, calls upon the Government to adhere to the terms submitted to and accepted by the Moscow Government as a basis of lasting peace between Britain and Russia.&quot;Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain. The annual conference of the Federation which opened at Leamington on the 6th July concluded on the 9th July.The principal decision on the 7th July was&apos;to adopt the executive^ proposals with regard to the policy to be adopted on the question of miners&apos; wages and coal prices. These proposals were that a demand should be made to the Government for an immediate reduction of 14s. 2d. in the price of coal supplied for domestic purposes; and for an advance in miners&apos; wages of 2s. per day for adults over 18, Is. for persons between the ages of 18 and 16, and 9d. for those below 16. It is significant that the advances in wages to be asked for are flat rate advances. It is reported that there was some opposition to this policy of joining a demand,for cheaper coal with one for an advance in wages. This opposition has apparently been overcome by the hope that the Government will refuse to accede to the demand for reduced prices and therefore that the Federation may&quot; put in an amended claim for increased wages which may absorb all the surplus profits.The conference also passed almost unanimously a resolution proposed by the Northum-berland association that the Federation should place on the agenda of the Trades Union Congress a proposal that the Parliamentary Committee should take over and make them-selves responsible for the conduct of the Labour College, London, and Ruskin College. A South Wales resolution that the Federation should take over part ownership of the Labour College was defeated. A long debate took place on the general attitude Labour should adopt towards adult education.Resolutions were also carried instructing the executive to ask Government for an amend-ment of the Coal Mines Acts so as to make it compulsory upon all employers to provide pit-head baths, and urging that steps should be taken to include the Cleveland ironstone district in the operation of the Coal Mines Act, 1919. It was also decided to increase the executive of the Federation from 20 to 24 in order to provide for representation of enginemen and of the Kent miners.On the 8th July the conference discussed the Ministry of Mines Bill, the question of the transport and manufacture of munitions intended for use in Ireland or against Russia, and the question of workmen&apos;s compensation for accidents. On the first of these subjects a full dress debate took place in which Messrs. Hartshorn, Hodges, and Brace took part, and a resolution was unanimously passed in the following terms : &quot;This Conference, having examined the terms of the Ministry of Mines Bill, hereby decides to refuse to operate it should it become law and urges the Labour Party to use every means at its disposal to prevent&apos;its passage through the House of Commons.&quot;It was also agreed that the Labour members of the House of Commons should withdraw from the Standing Committee to which the Bill was referred on the 30th June.1 Discussion on the Irish and Russian questions was brief and resulted in the approval of a resolution to be moved at the special meeting of the Trades Union Congress which took place on the 13th July. A resolution on workmen&apos;s compensation asked for payment during disablement of compensation from the day of the accident at a rate equivalent to the average wage before the accident, and in the case of fatal accidents compensation equivalent to three years&apos; wages or a sum of  600, whichever might be the.greater.On the 9th July, Mr. Smillie addressed the conference on the state of affairs in Hungary and announced that the Federation had undertaken to bear the expenses of delegates who attend the forthcoming International Miners&apos; Conference from those parts, where the miners&apos; unions have been suppressed. A resolution was also passed calling upon the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council to grant the appeal of the Winnipeg strike leaders.
The principal business on this day was, however, the passing of a series of resolutions outlining the industrial programme of the Federation. Resolutions were.passed in, favour of standardisation upwards of wages and conditions of work throughout Great Britain; in favour of the inclusion within the Minimum Wage Act of all surface workers ; instructing the executive to take in hand the question of long-distance travelling underground, and to arrange for workmen being conveyed in and out where possible, or failing this to institute a scale of payment for contract workers; and in favour of a 14-day holiday per annum with pay. On the 7th July resolutions had also been discussed proposing to give power to the executive in the event of a national dispute to call a national strike without a ballot vote of members. This proposal was defeated. At the conclusion of the conference Mr. Herbert Smith was re-elected vice-president, and Mr. J. Robson, treasurer.National Union of Railwaymen. The annual delegate meeting of the union, which opened in Belfast on the 5th July, concluded its session on the 10th. On the 7th July a resolution was passed re-affirming the previous decisions of the union in favour of nationali-sation of the railways, and declaring that any attempt by the Government to allow the pre-war system to become operative again would receive the most strenuous opposition from the union. The tone of the meeting, however, appears to have been much more favourable to the Ministry of Transports scheme for the future organisation of the railways than the annual conference of the Miners&apos; Federation has been towards the Ministry of Mines Bill. Mr. J. H. Thomas, in speaking to this resolution, complained of the want of policy and lack of consistency on the part of the Government in this matter, but he insisted also that the railwaymen had no right to place their sectional interests at a higher value than those of the community, and that they must convert the public to their point of view. He criti-cised the Ministry of Transport scheme as containing no reference to Ireland, and declared that if the new scheme had meant that they would be compelled to abandon their policy of national central organisation, they would have fought it to the last; but because that prin-ciple of national organisation had been recognised, they welcomed the scheme. A resolution was also carried emphatically protesting against the Governments policy in Bussia, and demanding that intervention, direct or indirect, should immediately cease and Russia he allowed to determine its own form of Government. The resolution declared the opinion of the conference that the best policy for the re-establishment of the world was the con-tinuance of negotiations with Russia, with a view to an early resumption of economic and diplomatic relations.On the 8th July the following resolution was passed : &quot;This Conference welcomes the joint investigation by the Labour Party, the Trades Union Congress and the co-operative movement into the cause of high prices, being of the opinion that unless there is an early reduction in the cost of living a grave situation will arise ; and it impresses on the Government the great importance of this question, and urges that more drastic measures be taken to deal with profiteers.&quot;Mr. Thomas declared that profiteering was not the heart of the problem, which was really an international one. He trusted that the resolution would indicate to their members that the passing of silly resolutions demanding increases of one or two pounds per week contributed nothing to the solution of the problem. The principal feature of this session, however, was the reception as fraternal delegates of Messrs. Bromley and Stevenson of the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Fireman.On the 9th July, the meeting discussed the Irish question and passed a resolution approving the action of the executive committee in convening the Bristol conference^ deploring the serious difference, of opinion on the Irish question aonmg the Irish working classes, and expressing the belief that -without complete&apos; unity among the working classes no satisfactory progress could be made.On the 11th July, Mr. W, Abraham was re-elected president of the union, and it was decided to hold the annual general meeting of 1921 at Newcastle-on-Tyne.Iron and Steel Trades Confeckration.-The Northern Divisional Council of the Iron and Steel Trades Confederation, at Newcastle on the 3rd July, confirmed the report of the Divisional Sub-Committee for the six months ending the 30th June. This report stated that the committee had considered the question of organisation on. the North-East Coast, and reported that several vigilance committees had already been set up in various works. Alderman W. M. Smith, of the Workers&apos; Educational Association, gave an address on the educational scheme established for the Confederation by the new Workers&apos; Educational* See this Report, No. 22, 26th June, p. 755,
Trade Union Committee, under the auspices of his association. Two resolutions put forward by the executive of the Confederation were approved, one calling for the cessation of secret diplomacy, and the other asking for an inquiry into the relation between national health and industrial conditions, with the object, among others, of placing upon each indus-try the entire responsibility for impaired health arising out of employment. A resolution in favour of the industry observing the first Saturday, in May as a national holiday was carried. It was also decided to press for a uniform regulation of holiday payments for members engaged in the steam and electric section ; a minimum wage of  1 a day; and payment for all recognised holidays.National Council of Port Labour Employers. The National Council of Port Labour Employers which was provisionally formed in October, 1919, has now been definitely constituted. Lord Devonport, chairman of the Port of London Authority, is president, and Sir Alfred Booth, chairman of the Cunard Steamship Co., Ltd., vice-president. The Council is composed of representatives of employers of dock and riverside labour and of associations of such employers in the principal ports of Great Britain, but not of Ireland. An executive committee has been appointed with Sir Joseph Broodbank (London) as chairman, and Mr. J. S. Spencer (Glasgow) and Mr. F. C. Allen (London) as vice-chairmen. The offices of the Council and all committees are at No. 22, Billiter Street, E.C., and Mr. G. Grinling Harris has been appointed secretary. This body was responsible for the presentation of the employers&apos; case before the Court of Inquiry, under the Industrial Courts Act, into the wages and conditions of port labour.Bristol Association for Industrial Research. The annual meeting of this association, which was formerly called the Bristol Association for Industrial Reconstruction, took place on the 29th June. Mr. E. H. C. Wethered, in his presidential address, claimed that the activities of the association had born fruit in the work of Joint Industrial Councils in many industries. The efforts of the association, in co-operation with the Bristol Juvenile Advisory Committee, had also had practical results as regards industrial apprentice-ship. The association have decided during the coming session to concentrate their energies on problems of unemployment.National Alliance of Employers and Employed. The relations between this body and the Industrial League and Council are illustrated by a meeting held at Leeds on the 5th July to discuss the proposed formation of a branch of the National Alliance of Employers and Employed in that city. Mr. A. H. Paterson, general secretary of the alliance, is reported to have given a detailed exposition of the aims and policy of his body, and to have contrasted the alliance and the league. Mr. J. Sykes, chairman of the Leeds branch of the league, on. the other hand, is reported to have urged the similarity of the work of the two bodies and to have read correspondence in which the alliance had promised not to. allow its activities to overlap those of the league. Further, the league was quite willing to discuss amalgamation with the alliance. The meeting rejected the proposal to form a Leeds branch of the alliance and passed a resolution adjourning the meeting until the two associations had amalgamated.Trade Union Topics.South Wales Miners&apos; Federation-Meetings of miners employed in the South Wales coalfield are reported which took place during the week-end of the 4th July. These meetings were held to advocate the reversal of the ballot vote decision of the South Wales Miners&apos; Federation against the payment of increased contributions to the Miners&apos; Federa-tion of Great Britain. It will be recalled that because the carrying out of the first decision would mean the withdrawal of the Welsh body from the national federation, a delegate meeting of the South Wales Federation ordered the taking of another ballot on the question..It is reported that the miners of the Naval Collieries, Pen-y-Graig, have decided, by 808 to 172 votes, to dispense with the services of their checkweighers. This and similar action in other parts of the coalfield throws some light on the question of coal output, the calculation of colliers&apos; wages and similar matters.National Union of Scottish Mine Workers.-It is reported that the ballot of members of this union on the question of a 5-day working week has been completed, 7,692 members voting in favour of the project, and 2,154 against. The membership of this union, according to the last report, was 111,200.(b 16280) N
Yorkshire Miners&apos; Association. It is reported that the South Kirkby branch of the Yorkshire Miners&apos; Association are seeking to be transferred from the West Yorkshire wages district to the South Yorkshire wages district on account of the higher scale of pay in the latter. A larger movement emanating-from Barnsley is expected in some quarters, designed to secure uniformity in the scales of payment for the different wages districts covered by the Yorkshire Miners&apos; Association.Yorkshire Deputies&apos; Association. A meeting of the members in the Doncaster area of this association of colliery deputies is reported to have been held at Doncaster on the 3rd July. Several local grievances affecting hours, working conditions and wages were ventilated. It was explained that the association will be worked in areas, of which Don-caster is one.Northern Colliery Officials Mutual Aid Association (Northumberland and Durham).  A meeting of the executive of this association was held in Newcastle recently. A circular before the meeting criticised the Ministry of Mines Bill. It was complained that the association was not represented on the Advisory Committee proposed under the Bill. In addition a demand was made for representation on the committee proposed under Clause 171, and for representation of not under 25 per cent, on the pit committees, and the District, Area and National Boards. The opinion was expressed that the Bill was worth working, but that it should be made impossible for strikes or lock-outs to occur until the proposed National Board had failed to find a solution through arbitration. These complaints must, of course, first be taken up by the newly-formed Colliery Officials&apos; As-sociation of Great Britain before a national movement on these lines may be expected.National Sailors&apos; and Firemen&apos;s Union. It is reported that the National Sailors&apos; and Firemen&apos;s Union are endeavouring to negotiate amalgamation with the other unions organising seafaring workers. Communications are taking place with the National Union of Ships&apos; Stewards, Cooks, Butchers and Bakers, with the Hull Seamen&apos;s and Marine Firemen&apos;s Amalgamated Association, and with the British Seafarers&apos; Union. The question of amalgamation with the last body has come to the front on account of their exclusion not only from the wider trade union movement, but from the Seafarers&apos; Joint Council and the National Maritime Board. The Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress are reported to be interested in the relations between the National Sailors&apos;and Firemen&apos;s Union and the British Seafarers&apos; Union. With.regard to the other bodies the feeling of the last annual conference of the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation was strongly in. favour of the closer organisation of such constituent unions as catered for the same class of worker.United Government Workers&apos; Federation. The numerous small societies connected with, the United Government Workers&apos; Federation have been faced with a difficult position in consequence of the application of the Whitley Report to Government industrial estab-lishments. Many of these bodies have remained on the borderland between trade unions and friendly societies and the smaller associations of government employees are finding their right to be represented on Whitley Councils challenged by the trade unions which organise workers outside as well as inside the Government service. Some are accepting disqualification while others are instituting strike funds and making themselves full trade unions or are amalgamating with outside unions. This last movement is stated to be threatening the existence of the United Government Workers&apos; Federation, and the societies which adopt this course are being urged, when they amalgamate, to retain the right as a branch of their new union to remain affiliated to the United Government Workers&apos; Federation.Ex-Service Men.National Union of Ex-Service Men. A demonstration organised by this union was recently held in Trafalgar Square. The resolution passed is a useful summary of-the present policy of this organisation, and illustrates their endeavour to amalgamate all sorts of discontent.   The resolution included the following demands : (1) Additional pensions for the disabled and their dependants.(2) The men who served in the mercantile marine, 1914-1919, to be dealt with just as though they had served in any of His Majesty&apos;s Forces. (3) &quot; Back pay &quot; up to 6s. a day.(4) The putting into operation of a permanent scheme to alleviate unemployment, especially among ex-Service men and women.
(B 16280)(5) A general amnesty for all political and military offenders.(6) The provision of houses of high standard and sanitary condition at a real &quot; economic rent,&quot; together with land nationalisation.(7) An immediate decrease in the prices of food and clothing.(8) The abolition of secret diplomacy and the withdrawal of all &quot; armies of occupation &quot; from all countries.(9) Complete disarmament. (10) Equality of franchise for men and women.International Relations of Labour.i International Labour Conference. The final session of the International LabourConference, sitting at Genoa since the 15th June, was held on the 10th July.   By a very narrow margin the two-thirds majority for the Draft Convention limiting seamen&apos;s hours :    of work to eight hours in the day and 48 in the week was not secured.   By Article 405 j    of the Peace Treaty, on the final vote for the adoption of a Eecommendation or a Draft Convention, a majority of two-thirds of the votes cast is required.   The voting on this Convention showed 48 delegates in favour and 25 against. The Draft Convention therefore j    failed to secure sanction by the effect of a single vote.  According to a message I    from Genoa the Director of the International Labour Office, M. Albert Thomas, regards the vote as satisfactory in that a majority are already in favour of the Convention, and he is confident that, the legislatures of the various members will be compelled to re-examine the question before long.  He is also of opinion that another Conference may take place shortly.   The seamen&apos;s organisations are themselves meeting in Brussels in August, when the position will doubtless be discussed.The Conference have adopted Draft Conventions prohibiting the employment in ships of children under 14 years of age, and securing the seamen&apos;s right to compensation if his ship is lost. The Conference also adopted Recommendations on the establishment of an international seamen&apos;s code, the provision of insurance against unemployment, and the limitation of working hours in inland navigation.&apos; This information is not based on a complete survey of the facts, and until such a survey is available, the correctness of details with regard to the conference cannot be guaranteed.International Federation of Trade Unions.-M. Edo Fimmen, joint secretary of the International Federation of Trade Unions and secretary of the International Transport Workers&apos; Federation, presented his report on the Vienna discussion between the delegation of the International Federation and Dr. Gratz, the representative of the Hungarian Government, to a meeting of the Bureau of the International Federation of Trade Unions at Brussels on the 3rd and 4th July. Messrs. W. A. Appleton, Leon Jouhaux, C. Mertens, and J. Oudegeest also attended the meeting. It appeared from this report that the Hungarian representative did not deny the existence of the &quot; White Terror &quot; in Hungary, but tried to exonerate the Hungarian Government from responsibility. The report was approved. It was unanimously decided to continue the boycott and, with a view to its intensification, if necessary, to secure contact with the trade union centres concerned and the organisations of transport workers, railway men, postal officials and bank clerks.The Federation have issued a manifesto, reiterating their claim that their action is not dictated by any wish to interfere in the internal politics of Hungary, but is based solely on Article 427 of the Peace Treaty. They request, therefore, the following guarantees for the cessation of the &quot; White Terror &quot; :-(a) Suspension of trade unions to be revoked.(&amp;) Trade union branches to be enabled to resume their activities and their confiscated property to be restored.(c) Anyone charged with a criminal offence to be amenable to ordinary jurisdiction.(d) Internment to be abolished.(e) Political prisoners to be released. (/) Emergency courts to be abolished.
NEGOTIATIONS AND DISPUTES.Demands and Negotiations.Mining and Quarrying.Coal Miners (National). The executive committee of the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain met on the 13th July, to prepare the case for the programme formulated by the annual conference^ These demands are being laid before the Coal Controller on the 15th July.Coal Miners (Derbyshire). In connection with the threatened strike of miners em-ployed by the Butterley Coal and Iron Co., Ltd., for the substitution of wooden for steel props, it has been decided that local joint committees shall be set up at each pit to inspect and report on the suitability of the steel prop. Notices to cease work have been suspended for a month pending the report of these committees, f o*Metal, Engineering and Shipbuilding.Engineers (Manchester District).&apos; Members of the Amalgamated Engineering Union in the Manchester district have resolved to cease working overtime on breakdowns, repairs or maintenance work until a settlement is reached in connection with the demand for the payment of an extra 9d. per hour to men engaged on this work.Transport.Tramwaymen (Manchester). Tramwaymen in Manchester have abandoned &quot;the pro-ject of making a sectional demand for an increase of  1 per week, and have decided to ask the national executive of the United Vehicle Workers to apply immediately for a general increase of not less than  1 per week.Printing and Allied Trades.&apos;Printers. A lock-out of members of the Typographical Association is threatened by the employers in the printing trade unless the executive of the Association take steps to remove the embargo on overtime in force in the Manchester district. A notice was issued on the 10th July that no overtime was to be worked in any offices in that district where the 10s. bonus had not been granted. It was decided by the Manchester and Liverpool branches of the association last week to apply for this bonus in addition to the 10s. increase granted under the national settlement.Public and Public Utility Services.Street Paviors and Road Makers (Newcastle). The street paviors, road makers and labourers, employed by the Newcastle Corporation, are demanding to be paid building trade rates of 2s. H. an hour for paviors, and 2s. Id. for road makers and labourers.Strikes and Lock-Outs.Building and Allied Trades.Building Trade Operatives (Port of London).-Negotiations are proceeding at the Ministry in connection with this strike. The proposal of the Port of London Authority that the rate of 2s. id. per hour, awarded by the National Conciliation Board, should be paid on new work only was refused by the operatives&apos; representatives and fresh proposals have now been submitted.Metal, Engineering and Shipbuilding.Electricians (Port of London). The strike of electricians at the Port of London for the payment of the district rate o  2s. 3d. per hour continues. It is expected that negotiations for a settlement will take place this week.* See p. 93 above, f See this Report, Vol. II, No. 1, 3rd July, p. 1,
Negotiations and Disputes-continued.Textile Trades.Lace Workers : Plain Net Section (Nottingham). No settlement of the wages dispute in the plain net section of the lace trade was reached at the joint conference of representatives from all districts, which took place at Taunton on the 6th July. The operatives at Not-tingham struck originally for an increase of 40 per cent, in wages, a weekly minimum of  4, and a 44-hour week. Last week they reduced their demand to a 30 per cent, increase ; the  4 minimum being abandoned in favour of a provision whereby individual cases where a minimum wage cannot be earned should be given special attention. This amended de-mand, including the 44-hour week, was placed before the employers on behalf of operatives in Derby and the West of England as well as those in Nottingham. The employers offered a 48-hour week but refused to concede any increase in wages. Thereupon the operatives&apos; delegates from Derby and the West of England decided to take a ballot of their members on the question of striking in conjunction with the Nottingham workers. In the meantime the strike at Nottingham continues.Woodworking.Sawmillers and Woodcutting Machinists (Scotland). The sawmillers and woodcutting machinists, who struck on the 17th May, have rejected, by a large majority, the amended wages offer of the employers.Furniture Workers (Leeds District). The strike in the furniture trade continues at Leeds and Bradford, and extended to workers at Keighley on the 9th July. A stoppage is also threatened at Halifax and Brighouse. The employers adhere to their original offer of 2s. 2d. per hour, while the strikers demand 2s. 4cd.Packing-Case Makers (Manchester). A strike began in Manchester on the 8th July of tin and wooden packing-case makers in support of a demand for 2s. 4c?. per hour, the district rate paid to skilled workers in the building trade, and a minimum wage for women workers of 50s. for a 47-hour week.Public and Public Utility Services.Gas Workers (Manchester and Other Districts). An unofficial strike of gas workers began in Manchester on the 8th July as a protest against the terms of the settlement accepted by the men&apos;s representatives on the 6th. Subsequently the strike spread to workers at Salford, Bury, Radcliffe, Stockport, Heywood, Oldham, Huddersfield, Rochdale, Wigan, Bristol, Weston-super-Mare, and several towns in the Pottery district including Stoke. Up to the 14th July work had been resumed in the Pottery district, Oldham, Wigan, Hey-wood and Weston-super-Mare. The men are demanding a revision of the agreement so as to include their full demand for a 10s. per week increase in wages ; the trade union leaders emphasise the fact that a resumption of work must take place before negotiations can be continued.Agriculture.Agricultural Labourers (Cheshire). The strike of agricultural labourers continues in Cheshire in support of a demand for  3 per week minimum wage. It is reported that men working on market gardens have now joined the strikers.Settlements and Agreements.Building and Allied Trades.Building Trade Operatives (Scotland). For the settlement of the dispute arrived at on the 8th July, see p. 122 below. The carpenters and joiners, who struck on the 10th May in support of a demand for 2s. &amp;d. per hour, were to resume work on the 12fch July, no victimisation to take place on either side.Building Trade Operatives (South Wales). The National Conciliation Board for the Building Trades held meetings in London on the 1st and 2nd July, when the South Wales and Monmouthshire operatives&apos; claim for 3s. per hour for craftsmen and 2s. I0^d. per hour for labourers^ was heard.  An award was made to date from the 1st July, 1920, granting* See this Report, No. 22, 26th June, p. 762.

Qd. and Is. 3d. respectively, in. the lowest grade, the two lowest grades to receive an additional Id. per hour on the 1st September. The rates of South Wales operatives will now be on a level with the highest rates paid in England including London.Metal Engineering and Shipbuilding.Bricklayers Employed in Steel Works (West of Scotland). Bricklayers employed in the steel works in the West of Scotland are to receive an increase of id. per hour. This increase will bring the total wages up to 2s. Id. per hour.Transport.Railwaymen (Eull).-k strike of locomotive drivers, firemen and cleaners on the North Eastern Railway occurred at Hull on the 12th July, as a protest against the system of promotion in force under the recent national agreement. The agreement provides that promotion shall be based on a man&apos;s total number of years&apos; service irrespective of the number of years he has served in his present district. It is stated that some time ago a number of men were brought to work at Hull on the understanding that, although their total service might be longer, they should rank below the local men with regard to promotion. The strikers alleged that this understanding has not been adhered to since the national agreement came into operation, The men, who returned to work on the 14th July, urge that a conference of locomotive men employed on the North Eastern line should be called to consider the national agreement with special reference to the clauses dealing with promotion.[Other disputes, negotiations and settlements, are referred to in the Wages and Arbitration Departments section of the Report, pages 122 to 126.]

The vacancies carried forward, exclusive of vacancies in suspense, show a decrease of 2,026 as regards men and a decrease of 1,469 in respect of women. All the divisions, except the Northern and the Wales, show decreases in the men&apos;s register. The Exchanges showing the largest decreases are Clapham Junction, Hackney, Grays, Leeds, Liverpool, Leith, Lowestoft and Norwich. The occu-pations chiefly affected by the decreases are those of clerks, porters, shop assistants, carmen, fishermen and general labourers. Increases in the register are reported from Kings Lynn, Leicester, Birkenhead, Birmingham, Hull, Gateshead, Heaton, Newcastle, Wallsend, Elswick and Swansea Docks, the occupations chiefly affected being those of riveters, shipyard labourers, painters, seamen and dock labourers.As regards the women&apos;s register, all the divisions show decreases in the live register, except the London and South-Eastern, the Yorkshire and East Midlands and the Northern Divisions; The Exchanges showing the greatest decreases are Kings Lynn, Southampton, Rotherham, York and Govan. The occupations chiefly affected by the decreases in the women&apos;s register are those of clerks, domestic servants and jam makers.Men&apos;s Employment.General Oictboh-The labour situation in the shipbuilding, marine engineering and allied industries is still controlled by the shortage of certain classes of skilled men and of materials. In Scotland the position is abnormal owing to the arrival of the annual trades holidays. The position in the general engineering trade is on the whole satis-factory, but the shortage of castings is still adversely affecting the industry, as arrears of castings caused through the moulders&apos; strike have not yet been made good. The depression in certain sections of the cotton trade still continues, but pessimistic views are the exception, and the Master Cotton Spinners&apos; Federation have decided not to take any action with regard to the agitation for short time in the trade. There are still some indications of depression in the soap, textile and rag industries, and the depression in the leather industry which has been noticeable for many weeks still continues.
Industrial Developments. At Woolwich Messrs. Thomas &amp; Edge have signed a contract for the erection of 100 houses at Welling. High Wycombe report that the Wycombe Aircraft Constructors, Ltd., are preparing to launch a scheme on a big scale for the con-struction of motor bodies. The scheme is, however, contingent on the completion of an arrangement for the delivery of engines and motor bodies from America, the intention being to assemble parts in this country. The Dunlop Rubber Co., Ltd., have acquired premises at Shrewsbury which will be opened shortly as a solid tyre fixing and distributing depot. At Stourbridge a manufacturer of galvanized ware and hollow-ware is erecting a new factory, which, on completion, will provide employment for several hundred men and women. Ilkeston report that the extension scheme of the Stanton Iron Works Co., Ltd., is steadily progressing and will on completion enable the company to employ 2,000 additional workers. At Accrington Messrs. Howard &amp; Bullough, Ltd., are extending their works to accommodate 800 additional workers. Dumbarton report that the erection of new works at Bowling for the Anglo-Mexican Oil Co., Ltd., is steadily approaching completion. The Anglo-American and the Anglo-Persian Oil Companies have also secured sites at Bowling, but building operations have not commenced. The new industry at Irvine, where Messrs. Walker &amp; Co., Ltd., chemical manufacturers, contemplate laying down a plant for the manufacture of glass bottles and jars, will provide employment for 200 workpeople, of whom some will be women. Merthyr Tydvil report that at the Dowlais iron and steel works extensive by-product plant, with coke ovens and electric power houses, is being laid down.Labour Reductions. At Canning Town a firm of sugar refiners have discharged 151 workpeople. Dartford report that Messrs. Vickers, Ltd., have practically closed down at Joyce Green, while at Dartford they have closed several of their shops. At Southall, the Gramophone Co., Ltd., and the Maypole Margarine Works, Ltd., have dispensed with a number of workers. In the Stanningley area Messrs. R. Thackray &amp; Sons, Newlay, leather manufactui&apos;ers, have closed down. Blackburn report that there is abnormal unemployment in the cotton trade and that hundreds of looms are idle. It is reported from Liverpool that one of the largest Mersey shipyards has stopped over 1,000 work-people during the last week or so, and the smaller firms are also feeling the local depression.Shortage of Labour. The situation in the London building trades has not varied during the week. The slackness in the painting trade continues, and as no new work is coming in, the number of workmen unemployed is increasing. The scarcity of carpenters, bricklayers, plasterers and plumbers remains acute, and in consequence there is much difficulty in placing unskilled workmen in these occupations. This position is reflected in the building trade throughout the country so far as skilled workmen are concerned, but, notwithstanding the adverse labour situation, operations have been commenced on a number of approved housing schemes, and at Shrewsbury the local co-operative society have applied to the Corporation for permission to start their housing scheme, involving an outlay of  200,000. At Barrow there is a shortage of fitters, riveters, shipwrights, turners and steel moulders. Dumfries comment upon the shortage of moulders, wood-spindle machinists and motor fitters. There is a shortage of cabinet makers and moulders at Kilmarnock, and Nottingham report a shortage of makers of hosiery machine needles.Transport Difficulties. At Guildford, the Fairby Construction Co., builders, could employ more men if a more frequent supply of bricks and cement were forthcoming. Redditch report a scarcity of castings which continues to retard the work of the engineering trade. At Rochdale a firm of leather manufacturers have commenced to work short time on account of shortage of material. At Aberdeen unemployment continues to be abnormal in the shipbuilding and engineering trades owing to the shortage of boiler plates. Glasgow report a shortage in the ironfounding, glass and rubber trades. Sunderland report that the demand for&apos; labour in the shipbuilding and engineering trades is still very small, owing to the lack of material, due to the difficulties of transport and the recent moulders&apos; strike. Messrs. Fleming &amp; Ferguson, Ltd., Paisley, complain that a consignment of steel plates urgently required and completed over a week ago is held up for want of transport facilities. At Gloucester, Messrs. Ellis, Bingham &amp; Morris are unable to engage more unskilled labour on the erection of the new shipbuilding yard owing to delay in the trans-port of machinery essential for carrying on the work.Women&apos;s Employment.General Industrial Situation. There has been no change in the general position with regard to women. Difficulty is still experienced in placing general factory hands owing
to^ slackness in many of the manufacturing trades, but a demand prevails for most skilled workers. Women experienced in laundry work, tailoring, wire-mattress weaving, upholstery and bookbinding are required in the London and South-Eastern Division. Skilled weavers are still in demand in the North-Western and the Yorkshire and East Midlands Divisions, in spite of the temporary slackness in some textile areas, which is causing many mills to work short time, or to extend the annual trades holiday. Scotland report a falling off in the demand for textile workers.There is still a demand for experienced brass polishers and needle-makers in the metal industries of the West Midlands Division, and vacancies for tinplate workers have been notified at Port Talbot and Gorseinon.The South Midlands and Eastern Division report increased slackness in the boot and shoe trade, especially at Northampton, Loughborough and Norwich. Short time is also being worked in the hosiery factories of Leicester and Loughborough. The straw hat trade at Luton is experiencing the usual seasonal slackness. Both the jute trade of Scotland and the rubber industries of the West Midland and London districts continue abnormally quiet.Many firms are now using cardboard containers instead of tin boxes, and vacancies for skilled cardboard makers have been notified in Camden Town, Brentford and Leyton. Difficulty is experienced in all divisions in placing the many semi-skilled clerical workers who desire further work of a similar nature, but Scotland again report an improvement in the general position of clerical workers in Edinburgh. Many unskilled workers have been absorbed in seasonal agricultural and fruit-picking work, but owing to the light crops and wet weather the demands for this class of labour have been smaller than usual.Great difficulty is still experienced in finding accommodation for women imported into the busier industrial areas.Local Reports. The London and South-Eastern Division report slackness in dress-making owing to the closing of the London season, but there are still vacancies in many districts for skilled women. Discharges are reported of tinworkers at Deptford and Borough, soap and rubber workers at Canning Town, and employees of the National Cartridge and Box Repairing Factory at Dagenham Dock. It is understood that the work of breaking down gas masks which was discontinued at Ridham Salvage Depot is to be resumed at Queenborough; the firm concerned has been canvassed, and has promised to notify all vacancies to the Exchange. It is hoped that a large number of unskilled workers will be required. Willesden report increased difficulties in placing workers in other North London districts owing to the increase of tramway fares.A general depression in trade is reported by the South-Western Division, and very few orders have been obtained through the canvassing which has been carried out in several districts. A surgical appliance factory has recently been opened at Cheltenham; applicants have already been placed, and further workers will be required when more material and machinery are to hand.Depression in the Stourbridge fire-brick making industry is again reported. Many women have been suspended from a hollow-ware factory as a result of a fire. Messrs. McCormack are enlarging their drapery business at West Bromwich; 47 women and 10 girls have been placed with them as shop assistants.Two factories engaged in the manufacture of underclothing and upholstery in Oxford have notified their intention to reduce their staffs owing to lack of orders. It is reported that Messrs. Chivers &amp; Sons, Ltd., will not require any further hands at their jam factory at Histon until the hard fruit season commences. During the last few weeks 85 applicants have been placed with this firm.The Yorkshire and East Midlands Division report that there are no occupations in which unemployment is abnormal, with the exception of the lace trade, which is still affected by the strike in the plain net section and the seasonal depression. Difficulty in placing unskilled factory workers is being experienced in the areas of Attercliffe, Mex-borough and Rotherham. At Hull many women have registered with a view to obtaining work as flax weeders.The textile industry in the North-Western Division has been interrupted by the trade holidays and stock-taking. On the whole the textile mills are working at a low pressure; but Shaw, Rochdale, Chadderton and New Mills report that the cotton trade is steady in those areas. The slight depression in the cotton trade is said to be affecting kindred industries in Manchester.  A shortage of hat trimmers is again reported at(b 16280) 0
17.7.2G.104Denton. Lodgings for weavers brought from Dublin have been obtained in Rawtenstall, through the recent house-to-house canvass.Industry is slack in the Northern Division and small discharges are reported from several towns. Over a hundred unskilled workers from various districts have been placed in vacancies in connection with the Royal Agricultural Show at Darlington. Good results have been obtained in placing women in seasonal domestic work, especially in the Kendal district.There is still a shortage of linen weavers at Dunfermline, but the position has been eased by the training of over 100 women as damask weavers.Many French polishers and box makers in Glasgow continue idle owing to the con-tinuance of the sawyers&apos; strike.The position with regard to seasonal domestic work in the Wales Division is improving, many women having come forward for this class of work during the week. * -local employment committees.Activities of Committees.Employment and Resettlement. The Dover Committee report that negotiations between the Stanlee Ship Breaking Co. and the Admiralty have been successfully con-cluded, ard the firm have commenced operations. Forty men have already been started, and in the course of a few months it is expected that 1,000 men will be employed, all of whom will be engaged through the local Exchange. The Dover Corporation have com-menced operations on the housing scheme, and on the re-conditioning of a recreation ground.  Both undertakings have absorbed a number of workpeople.Training. After considering the resolution circulated by the Clapham Junction Committee on the payment of allowances to disabled men awaiting training, the Finchley Committee suggest that the department should discriminate between an ex-Service man who has not been accepted owing to his unsuitability for training, and a man who has been accepted for training and cannot be placed immediately. The committee express the opinion that the former type of applicant cannot expect assistance from the Training Department, but that the Training Department should provide for the subsistence of applicants of the latter type until they are actually placed in training. Redruth have passed a resolution that Local Technical Advisory Committees for all trades might be set up in their area.Barnstaple state that the shortage of apprentices in the local building trade again gives rise to considerable apprehension, but they have decided to leave the matter for the present with the Juvenile Employment Committee and the representatives of the building trade.Ex-Service Men. Aldershot report that they have now come to an arrangement with the Aldershot Command by which all soldiers about to receive their discharge are interviewed by a representative of the Exchange with a view to employment being found for them as soon as they leave the army.Sutton-in-Ashfield have been in communication with the local mining associations in connection with the reinstatement of ex-Service men, and the associations have promised to investigate, with the colliery companies. concerned, any cases of failure to reinstate ex-Service men which may come to the notice of the committee. In connection with this question Merthyr Tydvil do not consider it necessary to set up a special committee.

discharged and disabled sailors and soldiers.National Scheme.Up to the 6th July, certificates had been issued to 18,301 employers. The total number of workpeople employed by these signatories to the scheme is 2,987,072, and the under-takings signed by them cover 175,946 disabled ex-Service men.A further canvass of local authorities now in progress is meeting;with fairly satisfactory results. The Ministry of Health and the Scottish Office are again being approached with a view to their co-operation.The North-Western Division report that as a result of negotiations with the Famworth and District Cotton Federation, the members of that federation have agreed to employ disabled men to the extent of at least 2 per cent, of their total establishment.A report was presented to the Nottingham Employment Committee at a meeting on the 23rd June, showing that 10 undertakings had been obtained as the result of a further canvass of 48 firms who had not given satisfactory replies when first visited. At the same meeting, however, one of the members, speaking of his experience in connection with the canvass of employers in the lace trade, stated that he had come to the conclusion that the voluntary nature of the scheme was not sufficient, and that the time had come when the voluntary system should be replaced by a compulsory system.The Swindon and District Employment Committee considered the result of the special canvass of their area as very satisfactory, and desired to place on record their appreciation of the work done by the Exchange staflr.Piacings.The City Exchange report the placing of 11 men as night telephonists, of whom six had lost their legs.(b 16280) 0 2Work of the Courts of Referees.Out-of-Work Donation Appeal Cases &apos;,(Great Britain).

juvenile branch.Juvenile Employment Committees.Suggestions for Improvements. The following suggestions for improving the work of Juvenile Employment Committees have been included in a report which the Plymouth Juvenile Advisory Committee have prepared for the Committee of Inquiry into the Employment Exchanges : Industry should have greater representation on the commit-tees ; for juvenile work specially experienced and capable staff should be selected; and if separate premises cannot be provided for the Juvenile Exchange, there should be a separate entrance in the common building. Steps should be taken to secure that head teachers send to the Exchange reports on all children leaving school.Boys at Race Meetings. At a meeting of the York Choice of Employment Sub-Com-mittee, it was decided that, owing to the large number of boys of school age employed by bookmakers during the May races, efforts should be made to exclude children from race meetings. Instructions were given that an advertisement should be inserted in the local newspapers a week before each race meeting, warning parents and others that proceedings would be taken where boys were being employed contrary to the&apos; by-laws, and that a communication should be forwarded to the Race Committee, asking them to prohibit the employment of school children in the enclosures.Street Trading. Since the 1st April, .1919, the Blackburn Juvenile Employment Committee have undertaken the regulation of street trading by juveniles. There were then 130 boys trading in the streets but the committee&apos;s efforts reduced the number to 76 by June, 1919, and on the 31st March last there were only 38 so employed. Of this number 12 were between the ages of 13 and 16 and exempt from school attendance, and 26 were between the ages of 12 and 14 and were not exempt from school. By-laws have been submitted to the Home Office under the Education Act, 1918, which, when approved, will further limit street trading by juveniles.The Dewsbury Juvenile Advisory Committee, in 1915, made an arrangement with the Watch Committee whereby applicants for street-trading licences were registered at the Employment Exchange. This enabled the committee to offer such applicants alternative and more desirable employment wherever practicable. Now that the Education Committee are responsible for regulating street trading by children and young persons, the old arrangement has been discontinued and the Education Committee have appointed a special officer for this work. It is hoped, however, that close co-operation will still exist between the Exchange and the licensing authority.[Reference to matters of interest to the Employment Department will also be found on pages 88, 90, 92, 95 to 97, 114,115, 120, and 127 to 130.]Deptford report that three men, who Lad lost their right arms, have been placed as meter readers. The positions are permanent, and the men are being paid at full labourers&apos; rates.The District Superintendent of the London and North Western Railway Co., Liverpool, has agreed to give the work of carrying fruit baskets to disabled men. This work was formerly done by women.The Manchester Corporation Parks Committee have stated that they are willing to find employment as park keepers for about 80 disabled men during the summer months.

The Director at Perth reports that the Dundee newspapers have again been approached, and it is hoped that they will continue to insert gratis parti-circulars of the qualifications of all ex-Service men recommended by the Perth Rotary Panel.The Director at Edinburgh reports that the prize list of the Royal (Dick) Veterinary College has just been published, and 11 first prizes and 13 second prizes have been taken by trainees under the Appointments Department.There is still a very big demand for qualified chartered accountants, and though the offices of chartered accountants are full of trainees, the general view is that these men will have no difficulty in securing good positions, particularly abroad.Each member of the Appointments Committee of the Manchester Rotary Club, who have hitherto been able to do very little for the department, has undertaken to try to find work for six men.In Liverpool the Rotary Club have been more active. Within the last two or three weeks upwards of a dozen candidates have been placed directly through their efforts, and they are obtaining clerical vacancies which are badly needed. A full meeting is held in the Liverpool office each week, when five or six of the more difficult cases are investigated and members individually adopt the candidates interviewed.In Coventry and district a distinct decline in trade is to be expected during the next few months. A recognised authority states that the decline is more or less an annual occurrence in the motor and cycle industries, A further factor is that cars which were ordered some months ago at a stated price, are being refused by customers on account of the increase demanded and of the uncertainty of delivery.The Director of the London District reports that there is a distinct falling off in vacancies notified.TRAINING DEPARTMENT.EX-SERVICE MEN.General.StatisticaL-Oa the 7th July 24,048 men were in training, as against 24,310 on the 30th June and 23,563 on the 9th June. On the 7th July there were 22,445 men awaiting training, the corresponding totals for the 30th June and the 9th June being 23,078 and 24,380, respectively.On the 7th July the number of men whose training had been completed since the 1st August, 1919, was 12,640, the totals for the 30th June and the 9th June being 12,255 and 11,127 respectively.
During the week 385 terminations were recorded, a figure which is well up to the average. The drop in the waiting list shows that these lists are now being cleared of all except genuine applicants. In dealing with this work the Divisional Directors have, in many cases, received valuable assistance from the sub-committees of the Local Employ-ment Committees and also from the Local Technical Advisory Committees. There have been 500 new admissions to training during the week, maintaining the average reached for some time past.On the other hand, the total number of men in training at the end of.the week, the first in which a reduction has to be recorded, is at first sight unsatisfactory. Nine out of 16 divisions have a record lower than that for the 30th June, and in three divisions taken together there were 350 fewer men in training&apos; than at the beginning of the month. It must be remembered, however, that in several of the special trades the full quota of admissions has now been reached in many divisions, and such vacancies as occur are there-fore not being filled for the present. Summer holidays are also a not unimportant factor in causing fluctuations in rates of admission to training centres.Exhibitions. Arrangements for the forthcoming exhibition to be held at the Central Hall, Westminster, are now well advanced. The Minister will open the exhibition on the 21st July, when it is hoped that the Prime Minister will be present and give an address. Judging from samples of the exhibits, a very good show will be given. Many of the tablets, signboards and posters that will be used at the exhibition are being produced by men in training at the Brixton School of Building.An exhibition of the work of disabled ex-Service men in training at High Wycombe was recently opened at the Technical Institute. Lord Onslow, chairman of the Bucking-hamshire County Council, presided at the opening ceremony and spoke in high com-mendation of the local training scheme in which the municipal authority as well as the local trade representatives show the keenest interest. Specimens of cabinet-making, wood-carving, chair-making, upholstery and furniture decorating and polishing were on view.  The wood-carving specimens are said to be worthy of special mention.The Divisional Director in the South-Western area has reported that the men in training for cabinet-making at Bath expressed dissatisfaction at the length of time devoted each week to theoretical instruction, drawing, and geometry. . This complaint was care-fully investigated by the Local Technical Advisory Committee at their ordinary meetings and at special meetings. The committee were unanimously of opinion that the syllabus and the type of theoretical instruction given would be of the greatest value, and expressed a very favourable opinion of the drawings that the men had completed.Welfare and Recreation. Monthly and other reports show that the welfare of the men in training is a matter of real concern to those responsible for managing the training centres. Following the visit of the Dowager Countess of Carnarvon,* a definite scheme will be put forward for practically every training centre in the Middlesex area. The manager at the Tottenham Tailoring Centre, which has only been opened a few weeks, has been one of the first to submit such a scheme. Here equipment for games and general recreation will be provided, and an annual outing is proposed. The men in training have agreed to a levy of 2d. a week towards the cost.Employment while Awaiting Training. In Scotland, the Northern Area Committee have recently considered the position of men waiting for training in approved courses, and a scheme has been formulated for employing them as guides to the City of Aberdeen during the tourist season. As it is recognised that the employment will be temporary, no financial assistance is sought from the Ministry, and the preliminary expenses will be borne by a private fund. The proposed charges are 10s. per day, 5s. for a period of three hours, and a minimum of 4s. for two hours, and the men approved by the committee will be provided with badges.Hostels. As there seems to be a strong probability that there will be a large increase in the number of men to be trained at Brighton, it is not considered advisable to close any of the existing hostels. The Divisional Director is of opinion that it may be necessary before long to open a new hostel at Hove.In connection with the proposal to establish a training centre for village handicrafts at Tittenhanger Grange, St. Albans, it is suggested that the house itself should be used as a hostel. Accommodation can be provided for 60 men, and questions of staff, charges and equipment are now under consideration.* See this Report,.Vol. II, No. 1, 3rd July, p. 21.
Orders have been passed to the Office of Works for delivery of the equipment required at the Claydon Residential Factory, and application has been made for a grant of  100 for recreation purposes. Questions of staffing and of the charges to be made to the men are also under consideration.Government Instructional Factories.-Arrangements have now been completed with the Ministry of Health for the inspection of men in training in Government Instructional Factories who claim sick benefit. Medical officers will be appointed throughout the country for the purpose, and their services will be available also for the inspection of men frequently reporting sick.Arrangements are also being made with the medical referees of the Ministry of Pensions, who are responsible for reporting as to the fitness of men to undergo particular forms of training, for their periodical inspection at least once a month. The medical referees will note and report on their general condition and the effect of the training upon their special war disability and on their general health. There have been a good many cases of breakdown, which it is hoped that these constant inspections may prevent. The certificates of private practitioners will not necessarily be accepted in case of illness alleged to be due to war disabilities.At the Sarisbury Court Government Instructional Factory there are now 45 men in training in various processes of the building trades, and 22 in the horticultural and agricultural sections.Considerable progress has been made recently at other Government Instructional Factories. The Cricklewood Factory, at the beginning of July, had 447 men in training, and is now the largest institution of its kind in the country.Training started at the Bermondsey Factory in the last week of June, and by the 3rd July there were 101 men in training. Among other factories making good progress recently is Chiswick, where the numbers have been raised from 96 to 140 in a month. At Tottenham High Road, where training started on the 9th June, there are now 70 men at work, and at Coventry the numbers have been increased from 66 to 110 in the month. Training has now started at the Hornsey Factory, where 37 men are at work. At Liverpool the Kirkdale Industrial School is being acquired, and accommodation will be provided for from 400 to 500 men in various trades. It is proposed that men now in training in technical schools in Liverpool and district shall be transferred to this factory as the accommodation now occupied by the men will be required by the education authorities for the normal work of the coining session.Equipment and Supplies.-Deliveries to Central Stores during the week include consignments of boot and shoe, hair dressing, tailoring, plastering and plumbing tools and also a small quantity of wood-working tools. In. addition, a number of blackboards, overalls, drawing instruments and bins have been received. Despatches continue, but it is very rarely that an indent for woodworking tools can be completed in its entirety.Financial sanction for the purchase of 10,000 bib aprons has been requested, and arrangements are being made for the purchase at headquarters of 5 per cent, of the total kits required in all trades in order that a sufficient stock of complete kits may be main-tained at the Central Stores.Treasury Sanctions.The following are among the most important of a number of proposals that have received Treasury sanction since the issue of the last Report: The expenditure upon equipment for the teachers&apos; training course at Sarisbury Court of a further sum not to exceed  1,335 in order to provide equipment for an additional 50 students.Authority to train ex-Service men in cigar making. The training period will last 18 months and a progressive learners&apos; wage will be given after the first three months.The expenditure of a sum not exceeding  6,300 upon the equipment as a hostel and canteen of part of the Claydon Government Instructional Factory, near Ipswich.The expenditure of a sum not exceeding  22,375 upon equipment for the Portobello Factory, Edinburgh.Schemes Sanctioned.During the week seven schemes providing 127 places have been sanctioned. In eluded in this number are 50 places for training in motor driving and running repairs.
WOMEN&apos;S TRAINING.General.Courses Closed.-The number of women&apos;s training courses in operation has been reduced to between 40 and 50 by the termination cn the 30th June of all the classes whose extension for the completion of the standard course has not been specially sanctioned.The final decision on the question of a general extension of the scheme was not received until the 29th June. All the necessary arrangements for closing the centres had been provisionally made. The Office of Works have been requested to terminate as soon as possible the tenancy of all premises no longer required, and all equipment provided for the courses closed is being speedily disposed of. The lateness of the decision to continue certain special classes, which only reached the local officers on the day these classes were due to close, made it impossible in several cases to cancel arrangements made, and about 10 of those which might have continued had to be closed. However, the large majority of the courses, whose completion has been sanctioned, are continuing, and the trainees have expressed very great satisfaction at being permitted to complete their training.(b 16280) PNational Trade Advisory Committees.Boot and Shoe Trades. A meeting of the Administrative Committee of the Trade Board was held on the 6th July, when a number of applications for training were con-sidered and approved. Proposals for the setting up of Local Technical Advisory Com-mittees at Derby and Brentwood were also before the meeting, but in both cases the matter was deferred for further consideration. A deputation from the Ministry of Pensions attended and put forward proposals for training disabled men in convalescent centres at Birmingham and Epsom. This question was postponed until the next meeting, when further information would be forthcoming from the Local Technical Advisory Committees concerned.Pottery. The committee-met at Stoke on the 6th July. The difficulties which have arisen at Barnstaple in regard to the rates and period of training for throwers were con-sidered and it was agreed that the matter stand over until the September meeting, when they would be in a position to discuss the reply to a letter sent to the local branch of the Pottery Workers&apos; Association. The committee were also very anxious that a Local Technical Advisory Committee should be formed at Glasgow, as there was a very great shortage of skilled workers in the trade.Local Technical Advisory Committees.Furniture. The secretary of the National&apos; Trade Advisory Committee attended the inaugural meeting of the Preston Local Technical Advisory Committee -on the 30th June, lt was resolved that the probationary period of training should be at the Govern-ment Instructional Factory, Preston.The question of the approval of training at the convalescent centre at Blackpool was discussed, and it was resolved that before coming to a decision the committee should visit the centre.The representatives of the trade unions agreed to discuss with their branches the number of men to be trained.Printing. A meeting of the Norwich Joint Industrial Committee, Printing Trade, was held on the 7th July. The secretary of the National Trade Advisory Committee was present, and the committee assumed the &quot;functions of a Local Technical Advisory Committee, and agreed to consider various schemes of training for the absorption of men into the trade.Plan Draughtsmen, Law Writers, and Law Typists. A meeting of the Advisory Committee for this trade was held at the offices of the Solicitors&apos; Law Stationery Society, Ltd., on the 7th July. Twelve men are now in training at the St. Bride Foundation Printing School, and more men will be admitted as vacancies occur.
Women &apos;s Training-continued.Dressmaking (Derby). An exhibition and sale of work was held at the Derby dress-making centre. The standard of workmanship attained by the trainees was very good. The chairman of the Local Employment Committee congratulated all concerned on the successful work on exhibition. The opportunity was taken to tell visitors that some of the women proposed to set up in dressmaking businesses on their own account,, and that their addresses could be obtained from the Employment Exchange. The majority of the women who have already left the class are doing well. Several are earning 45s. per week, and others are working for a time as improvers and are expected to become qualified workers after a short period.Nursemaids (Aberdeen). The medical officer for mother and child welfare in Aberdeen has given his opinion on the merits and importance of the course of training in nursery nursing in Aberdeen. He considers that the trainees were well selected and are satis-factory in every way. He urges an extension of the course. The Medical Officer of Health is also pleased with the success of the course and with the type of trainee. The course is to continue for 14 weeks from the 30th June in order that the trainees may qualify for the certificate of the Institute.Ladies&apos; Tailoring (Essex and East Anglia). The ladies&apos; tailoring class at East Ham are making excellent progress and an extension of two months after the 30th June has been permitted.War Widows and Dependants.Statistical. During the week ending the 3rd July, the number of fresh applications was above the average, 28 having been received, bringing the total to 2,418. In twelve further cases training was authorised, bringing the total of sanctions to 1,329. Twenty applications were rejected or withdrawn, and there were three withdrawals from training. At the end of the week there were 382 war widows in training, and 607 had completed their training.Since the transfer of the training powers to the Ministry on the 1st September, 1919, 1,182 applications from war widows have been received. During the period 612 have been sanctioned, and 709 have been rejected or withdrawn.Dressmaking Class (Liverpool). The local Woman Training Officer reports that 19 widows are attending this class and are making excellent progress. They are sufficiently advanced to work on materials of good quality, which have been made into children&apos;s coats and costumes.Disabled Nurses.During the past week two new applications have been received from disabled nurses and three sanctioned, making a total of 69 sanctioned to date. The new cases include one for poultry farming, one for health visiting, and one for secretarial work.Of the two new applicants one is at present in receipt of maximum disability pension, and is therefore at present ineligible. The result of her next Medical Board must be awaited ; any improvement to a lower disability rate would make her case one for further consideration.A grant of  25 has been obtained from the Special Grants Committee of the Ministry of Pensions, to assist a disabled nurse who is in training and was found to be in great need of financial help.APPRENTICES AND BOYS.interrupted apprenticeships.Questions Affecting the Scheme.Wages. The Birmingham Guild, Ltd., are proposing to pay much less than the stipulated amounts to two apprentices whom they describe as moulders. Fuller investiga-tion shows these men to be modellers working in plasticine or wax for the purpose of brass or similar moulding, and they are thus more nearly akin to patternmakers, The matter has been taken up with the management,
Apprentices and Boys-continued.The Scheme in Operation.Statistics, Up to the 7th July, 41 schemes had been approved and applications had been received in respect of 40 schemes. The number of applications received at Exchanges from employers for apprentices, for the week ending the 28th June, was 308, making a total of 41,544. The number of applications received from apprentices was 323, making a total of 46,596.Up to the 7th July, agreements had been received at headquarters in respect of 39,895 apprentices. Grants had been sanctioned in respect of 38,239 apprentices, employed by 15,190 employers. Of these, 13,718 weib under the engineering scheme, and 6,389 under the building scheme. The total number of agreements lapsed on the expiration of the appropriate period of training, or by mutual agreement between the parties, is now 7,148.Applications. At Bristol, the prospects of providing for some of the apprentices, who have been unable to find employers, is reported to be hopeful. The fixing of the 30th September as the latest date for applications has already produced a number of inquiries, both from employers and apprentices. Local headquarters have taken up the question with several members of the Local Employment Committee, and so far, every member consulted appears to be willing to assist, and the local representative of the Amalgamated Engineering Union is displaying great interest. If the apprentices can all be brought under the scheme, it may affect favourably the attitude of the union in the district towards the training of other ex-Service men in their industry. Some unexpected openings are being provided by an enterprising journeyman who has started a small works. He is already training successfully three ex-Service apprentices and has offered to increase the number to 21 within a short time.In the jewellery industry at Birmingham, the fixing of a final date for applications appears to have had excellent effects. The jewellers&apos; association have decided again to circularise the whole of the jewellery area in regard to the scheme. Further action is being taken in the outlying parts of the Northern area to make the scheme more fully known.Acceptance or Non-Acceptance. At Aberdeen the Town Council have recently passed by a large majority, a resolution that no contracts shall be given to any firms, except those which have adopted the scheme. Local headquarters expect that this will considerably strengthen their hands.In the pottery industry, Messrs. Josiah Wedgwood &amp; Sons, Ltd., Etruria, are not bringing their own apprentices under the scheme, as they consider it their duty to provide for them without State assistance. In the case of two other apprentices, however, who were not previously in their employment, they feel justified in making application.. Their manager expressed the fear that the scheme will be liable to abuse and that the safeguards against its becoming a subsidy to employers are not sufficiently stringent.Non-Observance of Conditions. Local headquarters for the South Midlands and Eastern area note that the existing labour unrest and the demands of the workpeople for increased wages occasionally raise doubts in the minds of certain employers of their ability to carry out their obligations under the scheme. They instance, in particular, a case at Dovercourt, where the building employers are contemplating a stand against these demands.&apos;The failure of Messrs. George Barker &amp; Sons, Perth, engineers, to pay the stipulated rates to three apprentices, has been brought before the Local Employment Committee, who over-ruled the firm&apos;s plea of misunderstanding and decided the case against them. The subsequent attitude of the firm has not yet been reported.Messrs. James Abernethy &amp; Co., Ltd., Aberdeen, engineers, have failed to reinstate an apprentice at the close of a period of institutional training at the Kobert Gordon Technical College. Training in this course was provided to relieve employers who were short of work, on the definite understanding that at its close the apprentices should return to the workshop to complete their training. The matter has been taken up accordingly with the local employers&apos; association.Training in Operation: Progress-Local headquarters for the North-Western area, report that during a recent series of inspections at Chorley the employers spoke highly of the scheme and of the smooth manner in which it is being worked.In the London and South-Eastern area, two apprentices, an engineer and a machine ruler, were reported as unsatisfactory, careless and spoiling work. They were interviewed by a local officer who pointed out that their employers could bring the question of the termination of their agreements before the Local Employment Committee.  The result(b 16280) P2
Apprentices and Boys-continued.was an immediate improvement, and a month later the apprentices were reported to be doing well.A number of firms are reported as giving special attention to the all-round training of their apprentices. Messrs. J. W. Furse &amp; Co., Nottingham, electrical engineers and contractors, who transfer their ordinary apprentices in the early stages of apprenticeship between their outside wiring and works&apos; departments (the ultimate choice of department depending on a lad&apos;s aptitude), are training their apprentices under the scheme in both departments.   Boys of special ability are put into the drawing office.general training.Boy Superintendence.Appointment of Superintendents. During the week ending the 3rd July, one firm appointed a boy superintendent.Apprentices: Conditions and Training.Transfer from Firm to Firm during Training. A Liverpool firm of wheelwrights and general smiths lay stress upon the advantages to be derived by boys, particularly when apprenticed to small firms, serving their apprenticeship in more than one works. They point out that small employers tend more and more to restrict themselves to one or two branches of their trade, and that large firms are increasingly sub-dividing their work into separate processes and departments. Small employers often do a different class of work from large firms, &quot;so that it would be advantageous for a boy to serve part of his apprentice-ship in a small, and part in a large, works.The secretary of the Liverpool and Mersey District branch of the Electrical Trades Union considers that boys should no longer be apprenticed to individual firms at all, but rather to a joint apprenticeship committee of the industry for each district. Such a committee would have the duty of ensuring that employers have their proper quota of apprentices and of arranging that during their apprenticeship boys receive training in various shops, and so have the opportunity of learning their trade thoroughly.Conditions of Training : Engineering (Perth). Local headquarters call attention to certain peculiar features of the industry at Perth, and notably to the fact that local fiims employ as a rule more boys than men, and that the town appears in consequence to have become merely a training ground for apprentices. All the firms in question are small, doing work which hardly permits the employment of many journeymen. On the other hand, the district is said to produce a good type of workman, as, oving to the small ness of the shops, a thorough experience can be obtained in all branches of general engineering. The majority of the apprentices are said to leave the town on completing their indentures to take up work with larger firms on the Clyde and in other districts.Shortage of Apprentices (Wigan).-A great shortage is reported in all the skilled trades at Wigan, as a result of the high wages offered by local coal mines and iron works. Consequently, neither boys nor their parents will entertain the idea of apprenticeship and, on leaving school, boys only desire a job until they are 16, when they can enter the pits. Moreover, some of the few boys who do become apprentices break their indentures to enter the mines, as mine owners are not particular as to the previous history of appli-cants for work.Glass Cutting (Birmingham).-A local firm report great difficulty in obtaining appren-tices for their industry, and, in spite of every effort, thev ware unable to do so at the,, end of the Easter term, the trade is said to be highly skilled, with a seven years&apos; apprentice-ship, the minimum rate for skilled journeymen being from  4 to  4 10s. per week.[Reference to matters of interest to the Training Department will also be Jound on pages 95, 104, 113, 115, 119, 120, 126, 127 and 129.]

JOINr STANDING INDUSTRIAL COUNCILS: REPORTS.Industrial.Building. The Building Resettlement Committee met on the 7th July. Regret was expressed that no acknowledgment had been, received of the letter recently addressed to Dr. Addison with reference to the alleged failure of local authorities to put into full operation Circular 39a, relating to the distribution of housing contracts. The committee decided to seek re-election by the Council at the annual meeting in August, although the re-election of members who have been remiss in attendance will be opposed. Reference was made to the shortcomings of federated and non-federated employers who are carrying out schemes of housing on lines contrary to those approved by the committee. A protest was made, and will be further considered at the next meeting, against the practice of certain employers who deprive other employers of capable operatives by tacitly agreeing to the payment of a bonus by the building owners after they themselves have paid the standard rate for the work performed.The committee again considered the scheme for adult apprenticeship evolved by Mr. Thomson, a building trade employer from Louth. It is probable that sympathetic consideration will be given to the revised draft by most of the trade unions, although the attitude of the bricklayers and carpenters and joiners is in doubt.
Industrial Councils Division-cow^MweiCarpet-The annual meeting was held on the 9th July. Before the business of the meeting there was a discussion on the action of the Ministry in interviewing representatives of the Scottish Carpet Manufacturers&apos; Association respecting the abstention of this asso-ciation from the Council. Eventually Mr. H. Wolfe addressed the Council, and pointed out that the efforts of the Ministry had been directed solely towards persuading the Scottish association to prepare definite proposals for presentation to the Council for discussion. The Ministry had given no official expression of opinion regarding the merits of these proposals, as this matter was entirely one for the Council. The chairman of the Council had not been approached by the Ministry because, until the proposals were definite, there was nothing to put before him. Immediately the proposals became definite they would be placed formally before the Council.The Council then proceeded to the ordinary business. The election of officers was postponed until the next meeting in view of the possibility that the Scottish employers&apos; representatives might then be present. The Standardisation Committees reported pro-gress, and it is hoped that their final reports will be available for the next meeting.Electricity Supply. The East Midlands District Council met on the 30th June. A schedule of basic rates, allowing for two grades in the area, was submitted by the Sub-Committee on Basic Kates, and approved. The sub-committee are now framing a schedule of working conditions. The District Council for the Yorkshire Area met on the 5th and the 8th July. Schedules of working conditions, defining hours, holidays and overtime, and laying down scales of pay for apprentices and probationers, were approved. The adjourned meeting of the National Council was held on the 8th July. The minutes of a large number of District Councils&apos; meetings were considered and confirmed. A resolution was passed urging the Electrical Trades Union, whose representatives were not present, to hasten the settlement of the dispute at Liverpool, as the dispute was causing a post-ponement of the hearing of the arbitration proceedings in regard to the application for Qd. per hour advance, the employers having refused to go to arbitration until the dispute had been settled.Flour Milling.-Th.Q first annual meeting of the Council was held on the 9th July, Mr. E. Bevin was elected chairman of the Council for the ensuing year, and Mr. A. E. Humphries vice-chairman. Captain L. H. Green was reappointed secretary and treasurer. A new agreement as to wages was unanimously arrived at, the negotiations over which had extended for two months. Under the terms of this agreement towns and districts are classified into five districts instead of three as formerly, and the grades in each mill are reduced from three to two. The wages for general labour are to be raised to the following figures : Class A, 75s.; Class AA, 72s. Qd.; Class B, 70s.; Class BB, 65s. Qd.; Class C, 62s. Any advances made to the general labourer to be the advance for every grade of workman; workpeople now in Grade 3 mills to get the agreed advance, and in addition to get any extra payment which might result from their promotion into Grade 2. The question of increased wages to youths and women arising out of this settlement was referred to the Executive Committee with plenary powers to settle, as also was the question of re-classification of mills.Glass. The draft constitution for the Domestic, Fancy Ware and Illuminating, and the Bottles and Jars Sectional Councils have now been circulated to constituent asso-ciations for ratification.Hosiery. The Council met on the 8th July. A deputation from the Joint Standing Conference of the Leek Textile Industries were received, and it was agreed that facilities should be offered for occasional conferences with the Leek District when any national questions affecting the hosiery industry were under discussion.A holiday scheme on a contributory basis was considered. The employers stated that, in view of the present condition of the trade, they were unable to recommend that steps should be taken at present to bring such a scheme into operation.,It was reported that committees had been set up in the various districts for the purpose of revising the price lists for various classes of work. The committees are, as far as possible, dealing concurrently with the lists for similar classes of goods. The agreed results will be submitted to the Executive Committee of the Council with a view to securing the establishment of a uniform list throughout the industry.Pottery-The Council met on the 8th July. The minutes of the meetings of the various committees were considered and passed for the most part without amendment. A resolution of the Organisation Committee recommending an application for a Govern-

A second report on education was approved, and a resolution passed urging the British Pottery Manufacturers&apos; Federation to devote a special meeting to its consideration, and to invite the operative members of the Council and a representative of the Board of Education to be present. It was resolved also that a deputation should meet the Stoke-on-Trent Higher Education Committee in order to press for the adoption of the recommendations of the report. A suggested draft order for the application of Section 116 of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901, to the pottery industry was approved, and application will be made to the Home Office for its adoption as a Statutory Order. The Organisation Committee reported that substantial progress was being made in the establishment of works committees.Quarrying. The Safety and Welfare Committee met on the 6th July. The Acting Chief Inspector of Mines explained the attitude of the Chief Inspector with regard to the proposal that the Home Office should draft safety regulations for the consideration of the committee. The committee will not meet again until the points at issue are cleared up. The Executive Committee met on the same date, and dealt with the question of an arbi-tration panel for the dispute in the North Wales slate quarries. It was decided to ask Lord Askwith to act as independent chairman of a Court constituted in accordance with the provisions of the arbitration scheme recently adopted. An agreement was reached regarding the number of disabled ex-Service men to be absorbed. It was decided that a deputation should approach the Ministry of Transport regarding the present facilities for quarry traffic.Road Transport. The Council met on the 6th July. An application from the trade union side for a national minimum wage of  4 7s. a week was considered. The employers&apos; side stated that at present they were unable to grant the application or to give any increase at all, owing to the conditions in the industry. The trade union side took strong exception to the employers&apos; attitude in refusing to supply the Council with the necessary facts and figures to justify their non-acceptance of the application or their refusal to make any counter-proposal, and moved that the Council be adjourned, and that the chairman report to the Ministry of Labour.Iron and Steel Wire Manufacturing. A joint conference was held on the 29th June to allow the men&apos;s representatives to put before the employers their case for extra pay for night work. After both sides had met separately the employers announced that they had decided to circulate a ballot paper asking the opinion of each member of the association on this question.Wool (and Allied) Textiles. A further meeting of the Northern Counties District Council was held on the 7th July to consider the question of the increase in wages to be made after the expiration of the present agreement on the 31st July. The employees&apos; representatives intimated that their executives were unable to accept the employers&apos; offer, which they considered quite inadequate; the representatives were, however, empowered to negotiate for a settlement but were not prepared to consider detailed amendments to the employers&apos; proposals unless they were considerably increased. The employers&apos; representatives were not prepared, however, to depart from the general lines of their proposals, although they were prepared to consider certain adjustments within the general scheme. The discussion, therefore, resulted in a deadlock, and the meeting of the Council was adjourned sine die. The unions are proposing to ballot their members with a recommendation that the employers&apos; proposals be not accepted.Government Industrial.H.M. Stationery Office. A sub-committee of the Council have drafted a constitution for works corrrmittees which will be submitted to the Council for approval at their next meeting on the 28th July.Non-Industrial.Entertainments. The Parliamentary Committee met on the 10th July. The nomi-nation of Mr. C. Palmer, M.P., for co-option on the committee was discussed. It was decided that since no member of Parliament would be in a position invariably, to represent the interests of both sides of the industry, Mr. Palmer should not be co-opted, and that members of Parliament already co-opted should be asked to withdraw. In future members of Parliament will be consulted when they can be of use to the industry as a whole. The deputations who have visited the Ministry of Transport upon the matter of reduced rates and fares have obtained all the concessions required.
Industrial Councils Division-continued.joint standing industrial councils : works committees.Artificial Stone.-The Interim Committee haying decided to recommend the formation of works committees, the chairman and secretary of the committee were interviewed and the assistance-of the Ministry in setting up works committees was offered.

One result of the meeting of shop stewards of the National Union of Gold, Silver and Allied Trades has been the establishment by the workers of a number of shop committees in works where none previously existed. The question of re-modelling these into joint works committees in accordance with the recom-mendations of the Council is to be brought up at the next meeting of the joint committee of the employers&apos; association and the trade union.Needle, Fish-hook, Fishing Tackle and Allied Trades. At the works of Messrs. Allcock &amp; Son, Redditch. a provisional committee has been elected to draft a constitution for a works committee.Pottery. Messrs. Goodwin, J. Stoddard &amp; Co., Messrs.

The meeting of the Committee arranged for the 30th June was postponed owing to, the fact that the Furniture Warehousemen and Removers&apos; Association, at an extraordinary general meeting, had been unable to decide whether to accept the recommendations of the Committee with regard to the proposed increase of wages. The employers&apos; association decided to ballot the members on this question and the result of the ballot will be known shortly. Any increase in wages which may be granted will date from the 1st July, according to the decision reached by the committee at their last meeting.-
Industrial Council Division -continued.Optical Instruments.-The Committee met on the 6th July. An agreement was reached on the recent wages application advanced by the trade union side. It was agreed that a general rise of \\d. per hour should be given from the first full pay-day in June. The employers refused to consider the principle of payment for holidays, and adopted the attitude that wages to be paid to indentured apprentices should remain a matter for arrangement between employers and parents or guardians. Owing to the recent amalgama-tion among engineering unions, the Amalgamated Instrument Makers&apos; Society has ceased to exist and the members of the committee on the trade union side now represent the Amalgamated Engineering Union.[References to matters of interest in connection with Industrial Councils will also be found on pages 96 and 122.]TRADE BOARDS DIVISION.proceedings of trade boards.Coffin Furniture and Cerement Making Trade Board (Great Britain).

The parties concerned include the principal hospitals of the Metropolitan Area, with four exceptions. The Court granted to adult male workers, and female workers, 18 years and over, a minimum wage of  3 and  1 15s. per week, respectively, in all cases in which meals are not provided. In cases in which meals form part of the remuneration given, this minimum shall be reduced by such an amount as may be agreed between the parties, according to the circumstances of each individual case, and based on the cost to the hospital. It was agreed that all time worked in excess of 48 hours in any week should be paid for at the rate of time-and-a-quarter. An agreement was also made concerning Sunday work and holidays.   (Award No. 371.)Bobbin and Shuttle Makers (Scotland). The Scottish Bobbin and Shuttle Manufacturers5 Association are no longer members of the Joint Industrial Council and, on behalf of the employers, it was submitted that in Scotland the industry is confined to the manufacture of bobbins and shuttles for the flax and jute trade, and that as regards the degree of skill required and also the markets in which the products are sold, there are substantial differences between the Scottish and English branches of the trade. The workers&apos; claim for the extension of the agreement dated the 27th January, 1920, was not established, but certain advances were granted in lieu thereof.   (Award No. 374.)Shipbuilders (Clyde). On behalf of the employers it was argued that on the assumption made in Award No. 369, that the earnings of piece-workers were not prejudiced by the introduction of the 47-hour week, the riveter had the same sum at his disposal with which to pay the heater as formerly, and that the heater could accordingly be paid the same rate for the shorter as for the longer week without encroachment on the net amount remaining to the riveter.

The joiners were so dissatisfied with the Award that they balloted their members and declared a national strike in support of their claim for 2s. 6d. an hour. The bricklayers and masons also took independent action and, in the West of Scotland, negotiated a separate agreement with the local em-ployers, fixing a rate of 2s. 4d. an hour for tradesmen and Is. lljd. an hour for labourers. They demanded the same rates in the East of Scotland, and, as they did not receive them they went on strike.The agreement secures a settlement on a national basis, including all the building trades, and covering the whole country.

the basic rates current at the date of the last Awards of the Industrial Court, subject to a maximum rate of 2s. 4td. an hour for tradesmen, and Is. 11 \d. an hour for labourers. This makes the maximum rate for tradesmen in Scotland practically uniform with that in England, but the labourers&apos; rate remains If dL an hour below the English maximum.The settlement further provides for a joint conference of representatives of the parties to the agreement, to be held on the 5th August, to consider a scheme for terminating, if possible, certain variations in rates between the several classes of tradesmen, which are a fruitful cause of unrest, and for the grading of districts. It is hoped that the conference will also assist in the establishment of machinery for settling rates in Scotland on a national basis in future.Cable Makers (Prescot). A strike involving between 3,000 and 4,000 workmen occurred at the works of the British Insulated and Helsby Cables, Ltd., Prescot, on the 23rd June, in consequence of the discharge of two workmen for alleged illegal clocking off. The firm agreed to reinstate the men, but various other grievances which had been under discussion for some time were raised by the local representative of the Workers&apos; Union. As a result of the efforts of the department, the managing director of the firm met the union branch official together with a representative of the Workers&apos; Union headquarters on the 2nd July, in London, when a settlement was reached.  The men returned to work on the 5th July.A representative of the firm was interviewed by an officer of the department on the subject of granting to the canteen workers any advance conceded to the factory workers. The genera] position of canteen workers was discussed and it was pointed out that in a number of factories canteen workers had participated in advances of wages.Gas Workers (National). At the conference on the 6th July, the following general terms of settlement were drawn up : An increase of Is. per day or per shift from and including the 1st May. Certain concessions as to holidays and overtime, payment for work on Sunday to all workers to be at the rate of time-and-a-half, for 24 hours, except in cases where the Sunday shift forms part of a six-shift week. In the case of day workers, time-and-a-quarter for the first two hours and time-and-a-half afterwards, each day to stand by itself, subject to 47 hours having been worked that week, the exception being that time-and-a-half be paid for the 24 hours on Sunday.  The terms affect about 100,000 workers.*Leather Workers (Birmingham). The Amalgamated Portmanteau, Bag and Fancy Leather Workers&apos; Trade Society, the Midland Leather Trades Federation and the Union of Saddlers and General Leather Workers have persistently refused to act together, causing complications and difficulties in the trade. The Chief Conciliation Officer, Birmingham, has been instrumental in bringing the parties together and the unions have now agreed to make a joint application for an increase of wages to the employers.Ship-Repairers (Fowey).-Shipwrights and labourers, employed by the ship-repairing firms at Fowey, struck work on the 7th June for increased wages, but on the advice of the Chief Conciliation Officer, Bristol, returned to work pending a joint conference. This took place on the 28th June, and the men accepted the employers&apos; offer which was. based on an approximate pre-war basic rate, plus all general advances to date.Ship Platers (Humber). A. strike of ship platers took place at the yard of Messrs. Livingston and Cooper, Ltd., Hessle, owing to the firm insisting on plain piece-rates, instead of the general practice in vogue in that yard, by which the men were guaranteed 2s. 3d!, an,hour, plus certain allowances. The alteration was made owing to the firm being dis-satisfied with the output. The Conciliation Officer met the firm and the men&apos;s representa-tive and conducted negotiations. Work was resumed on the 5th July, the men accepting the firm&apos;s terms for new work, and the old terms for jobs in hand until completion.Flour Mill Workers (London). The Chief Conciliation Officer, London, reported a, strike at the works of Messrs. T. E. Carwardine &amp; Co., Ltd., owing to the demands of the \ United Vehicle Workers for increases of wages.  A joint conference was held at which the Chief Conciliation Officer was able to persuade the firm, after much difficulty, in view of their prejudice against trade unionism, to make the following agreement: for salesmen, a guaranteed minimum of 60s. per week, with one shilling in the pound com-, mission on sales over  30 per week, plus 2\ per cent, over  50 per week; for stablemen, a minimum wage of 66s. per week of 48 hours, with certain exceptions for special cases. Women to receive 35s. per week and girls of 16 to 18 years, 25s., per week of 48 hours. There is to be no victimisation on either side.  The employees returned to work on these conditions on the 3rd July.* See. also p. 79, above.
committees, conferences and deputations,Road Transport Industry. The chairman of the Joint Industrial Council has reported to the Permanent Secretary that the meeting! proved abortive, and was adjourned without anv decision having been reached.Wireless Operators. The parties to this dispute J met in a joint conference in London on the 7th July. Although no decision was reached, negotiations are still proceeding and a further joint meeting will be held.Rope Workers (London). In accordance with the agreement between the East London Rope Works, Ltd., and the National Federation of Women Workers, representatives of the firm and the union met at Montagu House to discuss the question whether extra payment should be made for certain hours of the afternoon shift. The federation stated that there is a good deal Of discontent among the members of the second shift working from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., but not working on Saturday, as they receive J4s. less than the first shift and lose the advantage of reduced fares. It was suggested that both shifts should be paid a flat rate of  1 lLs. lOdL The representatives of the firm, however, were unable to agree to this suggestion until they had consulted their other directors. It was stated that as it seems probable that the Government will prohibit the two-shift system, it was proposed to dismiss the workers in this second shift at once and to run the factory oh the one-shift system only. The managing director agreed to consider sympathetically the suggestion of retaining the second shift for the present and of increasing, their ratev He promised to let the department know his decision within the week.* See this Report, Vol. I, No. 21,19th June, p. 743. \f See p. 117 above. J See this Report, Vol. II, No. 1, 3rd July, p. 10.Wire Workers (Birmingham). The strike of Birmingham wire workers* was settled at a conference on the 30th June, between the employers aid the workpeople, which was arranged by the Chief Conciliation Officer, Birmingham. The employers offered piece-work prices which would guarantee a workman of average ability a minimum of Is. Sd. per hour. The terms were accepted by the workmen, and work was resumed on the 5th July.Coal Carters (Blackpool). Coal carters employed by Blackpool coal merchants claimed three weeks&apos; retrospective pay, under Award No. 225. The Conciliation Officer met both sides, and eventually a joint conference was arranged at which the men&apos;s demands were granted.Withdrawal of Opposition to Unionism (London). The National Federation of Women Workers notified the department that the Fulbourne Manufacturing Co., Ltd., South Acton, refused to recognise their union and that the leader of their members in this firm had been dismissed. At the request of the department two representatives of the firm called, who at first adopted the attitude that no worker in the employment of the^firm should belong to any trade union, and that any person joining a union should be instantly dismissed. It was stated that this had always been their position, and that therefore when it became known that one of their employees had joined the National Federation of Women. Workers she was dismissed at an hour&apos;s notice. A discussion took place on the whole question of organisation, and finally it was agreed that the firm would put no obstacle in the way of their workpeople joining a trade union, and it was stated that they would be prepared to-reinstate the dismissed worker on condition that propaganda work for any trade union was not carried on in working hours within the factory. This decision is being communicated to the union.Tape and Small Wares Workers (Derby).-At a conference, convened by the Con-ciliation Officer, between the employers and the National Union of General Workers ami the Workers&apos; Union, an agreement was -arrived at which&apos; provides for a week of 48 hours, and certain minimum time-rates and piece-rates, which should become operative oh the first full pay following the 1st July. The chief feature of the settlement is that for the first time in the history of the Derby branch of the industry,.the manufacturers have all conceded the same basic rates. The rates agreed give advances averaging from 4s. to 8s. per week according to age.
125 17.7.20.Wages and Arbitration Department-continued.questions pending and miscellaneous.Margarine Workers (London). In support of their claim for an advance of 20s. per week, members of the National Federation of Women Workers, the United Order of General Labourers of London, the Workers&apos; Union and the National Union of General Workers, to the number of 1,500, ceased work at the Townmead Road factory of Messrs. Van den Berghs, Ltd., on 3rd July. The Chief Conciliation Officer, London, is in touch with the parties, but the firm decline assistance, stating that they are unable to offer any further increase in. wages, and therefore cannot refer the matter to arbitration, or arrive at any settlement which would be acceptable to the unions concerned. There is a further question of reinstatement of two shop stewards who were discharged about, a month ago, and of payment for two days lost recently when the workers were put on short time. The workers&apos; strike committee met the Chief Conciliation Officer on the 7th July and stated that the firm at first refused to entertain their application for an advance of wages, but later agreed to make some alteration in the event of an increase being granted to the railway workers. At a later meeting they offered an increase of Is. Zd. per week to certain classes of workpeople which was rejected by the employees, who sent in a week&apos;s notice to cease work. The firm refused to accept the notices as an intimation of strike, but ultimately accepted them as notices to terminate the men&apos;s contract of service, and they now regard all the strikers as having left their employment and the works are closed. The Chief Conciliation Office^ has made several efforts to induce the firm to accept conciliation, but so far has not been successful.White Marl Workers (Staffordshire). An agreement providing for a minimum wage of Is. 5d. per hour and an equivalent increase on piece-work and contracts is in force as from the first pay day following the 1st March, 1920. The workers have now applied for a further increase of Id. per hour, which the employers have refused to grant. The Chief Conciliation Officer is in touch with the case.Bone Brush Makers (London). The Ivory and Bone Brush Makers&apos; Trade Protection Society applied for an increase of 25 per cent., on piece-work rates, which the London Master Bone Brush Makers&apos; Association refused on the grounds that the trade at. the present time is unable to stand any increase. By the intervention of the Chief Con-ciliation Officer a conference has been arranged between the parties at which a settlement is expected.Dispute over a Piece-work System (London). The workpeople in the employment of Messrs. Thexton &amp; Wright, Ltd., tailors, recently came out on a claim for a 12J per cent, increase. To this demand the employers replied by introducing piece-rates as they contended the production in the shop was much less than it should be. The workpeople refused to have their system of payment changed and ceased work. Representatives of both parties have been interviewed by an officer of this department. The secretary of the London employers&apos; association, acting for the firm, informed the department that the committee of the association were not prepared to meet in conference with the United Garment Workers&apos; Trade Union unless the workpeople concerned admitted that the present cessation of work was not a strike but a case of dismissal, and that every man should ask for his job back again; and that they were prepared to accept the system of piece-rates and the schedule put up in the works- by the firm.A deputation from the workpeople informed the department that they would not admit the association^ contention that dismissals had taken place; that the present cessation of work was a strike, and that all workpeople must be reinstated without prejudice ; nor were the workpeople prepared to agree to a piece-rate system of payment. A meeting of the employees concerned passed a resolution agreeing to meet the committee of the wholesale bespoke section of the London employers&apos; association with the firm at the Ministry to discuss a system of payment by results on condition that the cessation of work be regarded as a strike, and that the schedule of piece-rates be withdrawn.This resolution was forwarded to the employers&apos; representative, who now informs the department that the firm have decided to close their factory. The department have requested the secretary of the union to call and discuss the matter.
* See this Report, New Series, Vol. II, No. 2, July 10, p. 50Threatened Strike of Funeral Workers.-By the intervention of the Chief Conciliation Officer a conference was arranged between the parties to this dispute to be held on the 12th July.* Meanwhile, the strike notices issued by the union stand to expire on the 24th July.Laundry Workers (Hull). A strike of laundry workers is in progress at Hull, arising out of a claim, made by the National Federation of Women Workers for a minimum rate of 45s. for adult women workers, an increase of 33^ per cent, on piece-rates, a 44-hour week, and one week&apos;s holiday with pay each year, irrespective of the recognised holidays. The employers have replied through the Hull Laundries Association that they are unable to pay the rates demanded, but are prepared to pay the Trade Board rates when they become due.  This offer was definitely rejected by the federation and a deadlock exists.Underwear Manufacturers (London). A difference having arisen between Messrs. L. Redman &amp; Co., wholesale underwear manufacturers, and their employees, members of the National Amalgamated Union of Shop Assistants, Warehousemen and Clerks, a conference was held under the chairmanship of an officer attached to the Ministry. An offer was made by the employers of an increase of 1\ per cent, on the existing bonus for workers earning between  1 and  2 per week, but they declined at present to consider the question of one week&apos;s annual holiday for each year&apos;s service completed. The union representative undertook to submit the offer to the members of his union and to submit the question of holidays again at a later date. The result of the union workers&apos; meeting is awaited.Women&apos;s Welfare Work in French Factories. Mile. Carof, one of the leaders of welfare work in France, called to discuss this subject with an officer of the department. She reported that welfare work was only commenced in France in 1917. She came to England to investigate similar work here and also wished for information with regard to the develop-ment of welfare work in the United States of America. She is specially interested in the subject of scientific management and agreed that this system should be applied as fully as possible, but only to buildings, machinery and routine of work. Mile. Carof reported that in several instances where welfare work had been carried on there had been marked improvement in the condition and tone of the workers concerned.[Reference to matters of interest in connection with Wages and Arbitration will be found also on pages 88 to 100, 115 to 121, 127 and 128.]
APPENDIX.questions  in  parliament.The following extracts from the Official Report of the proceedings of the House of Commons relate to questions in which the Ministry is interested.Wooden Houses (Wrexham): Employment of Women.Sir W. Davison asked the Minister of Labour whether he is aware that the executive council of the General Union of Operative Carpenters and Joiners have refused to sanction in the erection of wooden houses at or near Wrexham the employment of 200 women who have had from two to three years&apos; experience in the manufacture of huts, whereby the erection of houses in the district is being delayed and the women are precluded from taking employment which is awaiting them, and what steps he proposes to take in the matter, in view of the Government^ pledges that men and women should be given equal opportunities in the various professions and industries.Dr. Macnamara: I am informed by Messrs. William Thomas &amp; Sons that they propose to employ 200 men to assist in building wooden houses, for which they have contracts in various parts of the country, and that objections have been raised by the local branch of the General Union of Operative Carpenters and Joiners. I am making further inquiries into the matter, and will communicate the result to my hon. friend.Sir W. Davison: Is the right hon. gentleman aware that the learned professions, such as the Bar and solicitors, are thrown open to women, who are also appointed Justices of the Peace, and will he take steps to see that women are not prevented by the action of trade unions from undertaking employment for which they are skilled.Dr. Macnamara: I have undertaken to make inquiry into this particular case.  (1th July.)Wooden Houses (Wrexham): Employment of Ex-Soldiers.: Sir W. Davison asked the Minister of Labour whether&apos;his attention has been called to the fact that the executive council of the General Union of Operative Carpenters and Joiners have forbidden their Wrexham branch to relax their trade union regulations, whereby 40 ex-soldiers are deprived of an opportunity of earning their living in performing partly-skilled repetition,work which could be done by any fairly intelligent man after a few days&apos; training, the full rates of wages ruling in the area having been agreed to be paid by Messrs. William Thomas &amp; Sons, who have entered into a contract for the erection of wooden houses for the housing of the working classes in the district; whether he is aware that the provision of urgently needed houses is thereby being delayed; and what action he intenes to take in the matter.Dr. Macnamara : I understand that the proposal made by the firm of Messrs. William Thomas &amp; Sons was that they should engage from-40 to 50 disabled ex-Service men for a three years&apos; course of training as joiners, and five disabled men for a similar course of training as wood machinists, the weekly wage to be paid by&apos; the firm being 30s. for the first year, 40s. for the second year, and 50s. for the third year, and these wages were to be made up to  3 by the Training Department of the Ministry of Labour. The arrange-ments for training in these trades are regulated by a scheme prepared in agreement with the trade unions concerned. The proposal, which differs in certain respects from this agreement, was considered by the Local Technical Advisory Committee for the Building Trades at Wrexham, and submitted to the local branches of the trade unions concerned. These branches declined to agree to the proposal.&apos; A conference is being arranged between the Local Employment Committee at Wrexham and the local Federation of Building Operatives, at which I hope that a scheme for the training of the ex-Service men in question will be agreed upon.(b 16280)     &quot; R
Appendix- continued.*Sir W. Davison: Is the right hon. gentleman aware that for months past both he and the Prime Minister have stated that negotiations were in progress, and will he take steps to come to a definite conclusion whereby ex-Service men may secure employment, having regard to the statement to-day that 180,000 men and 14,000 officers are still out of employment ?Mr. Lawson: Ts the right hon. gentleman aware that the members of this House are continually discussing these matters without knowledge of the actual scheme, and will he expedite the issue of the White Paper in order that hon. members may know something about the scheme ?Dr. Macnamara: My hon. friend is dealing with the scheme for the training of disabled soldiers in regard to which I have promised to lay a White Paper, but my hon. friend (Sir W. Davison) is dealing with the employment of ex-soldiers.Mr. Lawson: Does not the scheme for training also lay down the conditions under which the men shall be employed after training ?Dr. Macnamara: In respect to that I am in consultation with the Local Technical Advisory Committee. On the question of employment, in connection with this case I have been making representations for some time. There is some difficulty, but I am very hopeful by the conference to which I have referred that we shall get a happy solution. With the best goodwill in the world it very often happens that any rash haste in these matters defeats the object in view. If my hon. friend wishes to help these men, he will give us an opportunity of dealing with this matter in a way which will best serve the interests of all concerned. (7th July.)Regularisation of Public Contracts to Reduce Unemployment.Mr. Newbould asked the Lord Privy Seal whether public contracts are regularised in such a way as to reduce unemployment to a minimum ; if not, whether in future such regularisation will be adopted.Dr. Macnamara: I have been asked to reply. The question of regulating public contracts, with a view to reducing unemployment, has from time to time formed the subject of careful consideration, and has recently been discussed in detail with the various contracting departments. Any attempt to interfere with the ordinary method of placing contracts in order to reduce unemployment must be undertaken with caution ; otherwise the effect may easily be to increase the contract price and delay delivery without increasing the volume of employment. Moreover, during the war, and to a less degree since, no adjustment of Government contracts for the purpose suggested has been necessary or possible. I realise, however, the importance of laying plans for the future in this con-nection, and hope that it may be possible to make arrangements with a view to meeting the object which my hon. friend has in mind. (7th July.)Unemployment in the Rubber Tyre Trade..Mr. Jesson asked the President of the Board of Trade if he is aware that thousands of workers in the rubber industry in this country have been discharged and others put on short time owing to the falling off in the demand for British motor tyres and other rubber goods ; that both the men&apos;s representatives and the employers are being held responsible for the unemployment and short time, on the ground that they have advocated the need for increased production ; and if he will have this matter carefully inquired into with a view to the prevention of further unemployment in the rubber trade and to prevent the need for increased production being further discredited by the workers in this and other industries.Mr. Bridgeman : I am aware that recently conditions in the rubber tyre trade have been such as to cause a certain reduction of employment and short time, and in this connec-
* See this Report, No. 2, 10th July, p. 74.Appendix continued.tion I have received a deputation from the British Rubber Tyre Manufacturers&apos; Association and the employees in the trade. The representations made by the deputation are now receiving my careful consideration. The suggestion that the difficulties at present ex-ineperienced by the trade are due to increased production was also referred to, but it was not represented that there was any real ground for this view, and it is in fact unfounded. (7^ July.)Sugar Confectionery Trade: District Committees of the Trade Board.Mr. Sitch asked the Minister of Labour the amount of money paid in fees and travelling expenses to the members of the district committees of the Sugar Confectionery Trade Board for attendance at the last respective meetings of these bodies, and the approximate length of time of the meetings referred to.Dr. Macnamara : The average cost of each meeting was  25. The meetings of these committees are only held when there is a definite business to be transacted, and this is usually at fairly long intervals. Prior to the meetings referred to, the committees had not met for six months. The Trade Board, I may say, have had under consideration, the question whether the expense is justified, having regard, among other considerations, to the shortness of the last meetings, which, I am advised, varied from 2f hours to 10 minutes. I understand that on 30th June* the Board resolved that the committees should either be disestablished or reduced in size. I will consider this proposal when it is submitted to me, bearing in mind the need for economy. As my hon. friend is aware, Parliament made provision for the establishment of District Trade Committees in order that an opportunity might be afforded to local employers and workers of considering the proposals of the Trade Board as they affect their districts and of making recommenda-tions to meet local conditions. These committees, therefore, are capable of playing an important part in the settlement of minimum conditions. (1th July.)Women : Employment and Training.Colonel Newman asked the Minister of Labour why the Central Bureau for Women&apos;s Employment has been superseded by the Central Committee on Women&apos;s Training and Employment; did he nominate any women to serve on this latter committee ; and, if so, will he give their names and the bodies and interests whom they represent.Dr. Macnamara : There is no question of the Central Committee on Women&apos;s Training and Employment having superseded the Central Bureau for the Employment of Women, which is an employment agency which charges a registration fee to employers and clients.The Central Committee previously worked under the Local Government Board, and, when that department ceased to exist, was taken over by the Ministry of Labour. I will, if I may, circulate with the Official Report a detail of the membership of the committee. The members are not appointed as representing particular bodies and interests, butfas representing women&apos;s interests generally.- The present constitution of the Central Committee on Women&apos;s Training and Em-ployment is: the Marchioness of Crewe (chairman), Miss Mary R. Macarthur (hon. secretary), Mrs. H. J. Tennant (hon. treasurer), Lady Askwith, Miss Lilian C. Barker, Miss Margaret C. Bondfield, Mrs. Austen Chamberlain, Mis. Gasson, Miss R. E. Lawrence, Miss A. Susan Lawrence, the Hon. Mrs. Alfred Lyttelton, Miss Violet Markham, Lady Midleton, the Hon. Lily Montagu, Dr. Marion Phillips, Lady Roxburgh, Miss Squire, the Marchioness of Londonderry (Ireland), Miss E. H. Durham, Miss A. Anderson, Miss G. Tuckwell, and Lady Kenmare (Ireland).  Two representatives for Scotland are now under discussion.Colonel Newman : Am I to understand that the Central Bureau for the Employment of Women is still in existence ?Dr. Macnamara: Yes.-(lth July.)
Appendix-continued.debates in parliament.Unemployment Insurance Bill.The adjourned debate on the Report stage was resumed on the 9th July.Mr. Sexton, supporting the amendment excluding friendly societies from the ad-ministration of the scheme, argued that the friendly societies, by setting up an organisation to find employment, would compete with the trade unions. Trade unionism, to protect its interests effectively, must be water-tight. There were employers who would go to the friendly societies to get cheap non-union labour, and there would be trouble all over the country. The friendly society machinery could not be efficient; an employer wanting a considerable number of men for a given trade would have to roam over the whole gamut of friendly societies. The friendly societies would be setting up again the principle of the old Free Labour Association which unionists had fought against for ten or fifteen years.Mr. Locker Lampson argued that to give the unions a monopoly of unemployment benefit would carry with it, in the long run, health insurance, and so wreck the friendly societies. The general labour unions would find it as difficult to set up the required machinery as would the friendly societies.Mr. Casey, speaking both as a trade unionist and a member of a friendly society, claimed that the individual should have freedom to choose through which organisation he would draw his benefit. Compulsory organised industry meant organised tyranny. His own friendly society had paid unemployment benefits, and had an arrangement for placing unemployed members through the local Exchange.The amendment was rejected by 226 votes to 44.Mr. Clynes moved an amendment providing that the Minister should not make arrange-ments with an association unless it had a system, reasonably effective, in the opinion of the Minister, of ascertaining the wages and conditions prevailing in every employment, within the meaning of the Act, in which its members were engaged.- . *Sir John Butcher claimed that the words went far beyond the necessities of the case, and threw upon the friendly societies duties which even the trade unions could not carry out.Dr. Macnamara supported the amendment, which simply imposed an obligation compulsory on anyone who became an agent of the Government under the Act.The amendment was agreed to.Dr. Macnamara moved an amendment providing for a waiting period of three days before benefit should become payable. He pointed out that to pay benefit from the first day of unemployment and for each day, would involve an additional cost of  4,750,000. If there were no waiting period, there would be an inducement towards the latter end of the week not to go to work. Those who wished to eliminate the waiting period could do so, if they were willing to pay, by bringing forward a supplementary scheme under Clause 20.The amendment was accepted.Dr. Macnamara moved amendments fixing the amount payable as benefit at 15s. for men, and 12s. for women, instead of  1 and 16s. respectively, as provided by the Bill as amended in Committee ; and raising the contributions from the employer to 4c?., from men to 4d., and from women to 3d!. In the course of discussion, he pointed out that the increased contributions were necessary to reduce the waiting period, and that as regards the rate of benefit, under Clause 18 unions or other organisations could make arrangements to provide for increased contributions and increased benefits.The amendments were accepted.
