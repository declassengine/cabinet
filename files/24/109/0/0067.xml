If this approval is given I will arrange,for the necessary steps to bo taken by the Treasury with a view to the preparation of a scheme embracing the various posts, grades and types other than the permanent heads specified in the Committeexs report and above&apos;the maximum limit to which the scheme framed by&apos;the Reorganisation Committee of the national YJhitley Council applies.With the report I circulate a copy of a personal letter from Mr. Asquit1 to myself which he has given me permission to circulate privately to members of the Cabinet.(Intel.)

House of Commons^ July, 1920. Personal,Dear Chancellor of the Exchequer,In submitting the enclosed Report on the question ofL the appropriate remuneration of the principal posts in the Civil Service, I think it might be useful if, for your own personal jnformation, I were to indicate rather more fully than we felt it desirable to do in the Report itself the principal considerations which we have had in mind in making our recommendation.     They may be expressed as follows(a) even the nominal salaries to-day of Heads of Departments are on a lower general average than obtained a century ago, notwithstanding that the volume and&apos; complexity of their work and the burden of responsibility are infinitely greater now than then, whilst the salaries of commercial and professional men, and indeed incomes generally, had increased, even before the war, out of all comparison with those of a century ago;(b) the emol&amp;nents of Admirals and Generals, in active command, are roughly double those of the Permanent Heads of t he  ?sforza t Civil Depart-ments, and, as part of the former is paid in the shape oftrion-taxable allowances, .the dis-crepancy is even greater than the gross figures indicate.  -(c) in some Departments - notably the Ministry of Transport ^ a number of officers subordinateto/-rlr
to tho Permanent Head of the D0p!%fttot draw higher salaries than,the  2000 plus  500 bonus normally paid to the Heads of the most important Departments. (In the case of the Ministry of Trans-port itself the   alativtty of the Permanent Head to his subordinates is ensured by his receiving  4750 a year; but this figure is out of scale when compared with the omolur:ie.ir:;e of the Heads of great Departments generally).(d) while there has never been any absoluteratio as between tho pay of commercial andlorofessional men on the one hand and Headsof Departments on the other, there is nodoubt that the general relativity has been affected, adversely to the Heads of Depart-ments, in the last two or three decades, and markedly since 1914,;(e) it is no uncommon thing for Civil Servants in high positions to be offered posts in the business world at 3, 4 or even 5 times their Civil Service salary:(f) unless the conditions of service generally are sufficiently tittractivo the suitable recruits will be undesirably limited.     The growing complexity of the machinery of Government is such that men of the highest ability are more than ever essential.
. (There is no question &quot;but that the salaries paid tosuccessful professional men and to men of standing in bigcommercial concerns are far in excess of those paid to thePermanent Heads of the most important Departments of State,notwithstanding that the duties undertaken by the latter aregenerally speaking more onerous and involve a heavier burdenof responsibility and longer hours of work than the former.The opportunities, .too, for illicit advantages in so large and varied a Service with access to confidential informationare inevitably great, and it is significant of the fir atraditions of the regular Civil Service that its record in this .respect is absolutely free from blemish.On the other hand Civil Servants possess some advantagesnot enjoyed perhaps in an equal degree by the professional and commercial classes with whom they are being compared.    Therois (or used to bo) a certain prestige attaching to their appoint-ments;   there are what maybe described as professional amenitiesassociated with their work;   and they have (in.the main)security of tenure -and pension privileges.     (As regards asystem of,pensions, however, it should not bo overlooked that not confined; to the Civil Service, and that it isit is/of value to tho State itself in so far as it has a tendency to anchor the servants the State wishes, to keep).lou will observe that we have not thought it necessary to suggest that the salaries of the Permanent Heads of tho great Civil Service Departments should bo placed on anything like a level with those&apos; ruling for comparablo appointments out-side the Service, notwithstanding that we were considering 50sts which represent the few prizes of a largo and varied Service; but we feel that the salary of  3000 (plus war bonus) which wo havo recommended would be no more than adoc-uate remuneration -for the duties performed whilst at tho same time representing the minimum necessary if the Officials in question are not to continue to be definitely handicapped in the discharge oftheir duties vis a vis the public.v - Yours faithfully,(Sgd.) H,H. AS&apos;iUI2H.
ENCLOSURE II,REPORT OF COglTTg,Chancellor of,the Exchequer..1*   In accordance with your request we have carefully considered the Question of the remuneration which should attach to the principal posts in the Civil Service as exemplified by a Permanent Under Secretaryship of State.2m  We have thought it desirable to confineour survey to the Permanent Headships   of the moreimportant. Departments of the Civil Service (a schedule of which is annexed), leaving for examination by theTreasury the question of any appropriate adjustment in the pay of the Permanent Heads of the Departmentsproper;which we have not thought/to include within this category, and of the higher officials generally (administrative, technical and professional) serving vuider the Departmental Boa$3.3.   We understand that the normal salary of each of the Heads of the Departments named in the attached schedule is  2,000 per annum, with a war bonus of  500, and that the Secretary of the Treasury receives, in addition to his salary and bonus as a Departmental Ifead,  500 a year to mark his position as Permanent Head of the Civil Service*    We observe, however, that the present Permanent- Under- Secretary at the Foreign Office receives  500 a year more than his brother Heads of Departments, and that the Commissioner of Metropolitan Police is on a scale of  2000 rising to  2500 apc*V from bonus.    Unless it is to be assumed that these two posts/are
-ar^r^f ^greal^r ib llity than other first class Departmental Headships, presumablyon any salary revision of general application thedifferentiation should cease.    The Permanent Headof the Ministry of Transport is apparently regardedas sui generis;    &apos;4f&apos;   We have Carefully weighed the various factors which appear to us to be revelant, among whichmay be mentioned the onerous and responsible nature ofthe duties falling to the Permanent Heads of the greatadministrative Departments (which has become much moreburdensome during the last two or three decades, andparticularly since the outbreak of war), the emolumentsof men holding o&amp;mparable positions in the commercial and professional world or in the fighting Services, the&quot;remuneration Of technical officers who are serving inGovernment Departments in positions subordinate to thatof the Permanent Head of the Department, and the necessityof ensuring that the conditions of service generally are sufficiently attractive to secure an adequate supply ofsuitable recruits $ and we are unanimously of opinion thatisthe century old rate of remuneration now given/ Jmdcquato After making full allowance for any advantage enjoyed by civil servants in the matter of the prestige attaching to their appointments, the professional amenities associated with their work, and their security of tenure and pension privileges^ we are of opinion that the salary of the respective Permanent Heads of the Departments under consideration should be raised to &apos; 300oayear, as a figure which- cannot be challenged either on the merits of/the
-the-&quot;^oeroF -oixjiny -comparative basi3*5*    In making this recommendation wo have assumed, that the payment to these officers of the war bonus of  500 a year will be continued and that the conditions of the bonus allowance will be regulated by reference to considerations of general applications ?;oM.(Signed)      H.
