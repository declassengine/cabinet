No. 6711MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.I circulate herewith a Memorandum which has been prepared in the War Offioe on the question of ^introducing railway concessions enjoyed by the Arhiy before the war, and I hope that it may be possible for the Cabinet to consider the matter at an early date.;  w. s. $The War Office, 30th June, 1920.Memorandum prepared ix the War Office in regard to Railway Concessionsfor Troops in the United Kingdom.During the war the concession to troops travelling on the railway were extended considerably beyond those prevailing before the war.The Ministry of Transport and the Treasury agreed on the 3rd February, 1920, to the return to pre-war concessions on the understanding that- extensions of these concessions made during the war should cease. The minister was apparently prepared to issue a direction to this effect under Section 30 (i.) of the Ministry of Transport Act.2. The railway companies, however, were not prepared to accept this arrangement unlesB the Government paid not only the actual loss which the railway companies suffered by the concessions, but the difference between the sum actually paid under the concessions and the sum which would have been payable if the concessions did not exist.The Minister subsequently altered his view and decided not to issue the direction. The Treasury also receded from their previous proposal and suggested on the 16th March, 1920, that :-(a.) Concession (1) in the appended Schedule should be discontinued in view ofthe increase in officers&apos; pay. (6.) Concessions (2) and (3), if granted, should be debited to Army funds.Concessions (4), (5), (6), (7) and (8) are not specifically dealt with, but under the general proposal of the Treasury, if- granted, they would be debited to Army funds.The circumstances under which the concessions were given are shown in the Schedule attached.3. It is submitted that the Government never intended when the new rates of pay Were fixed, that increases in pay given with one hand should be taken back with the other hand in the form of withdrawal of concessions.In view of the number of officers promoted from the ranks now serving, and who will in future be serving, any such novel doctrine &quot;would not only cause great hardship, but would give rise to considerable dissatisfaction1.Further, it must be remembered that in every other country in tne world, concessions to the Army greater than those enumerated in the attached schedule are imposed by law on railway companies, as a Condition either of the grant or of the continuance of their monopoly.Imposition of such concessions by law had, until the Ministry of Transport was formed, been unnecessary because the railway companies gave them of their own free will.(b20/302)   100  6/20  h&amp;s  8347wo
Further, the railway.companies would not have made these concessions had they involved any loss to the company and not, in fact, been of financial benefit to them.4. Now, the Army Council and the other fighting service departments are faced either with a heavy subsidy from their votes to railway companies or with withdrawal of concessions, which are moderate and valuable in the public interest.5. It is clear that the railway companies benefit considerably b) the military traffic due to troops being stationed on their lines.It is also beyond doubt that the railway companies will lose considerably if the Koyal Tournament were to be abandoned or Rifle Clubs closed.This may result from the attitude taken up now for the first time by the railway companies and supported by the Ministry of Transport.6. In view of the public interests involved and the fact that the new doctrine appears to have found weight with the Treasury that a portion of the increase in the rates of pay of officers is to be recovered in withdrawal of pre-war concessions, not directly or indirectly referred to in Army Order 324 of 1919, the matter is submitted to the Cabinet for a ruling whether the pre-war concessions should not be insisted upon if necessary by the issue of a direction under the powers of the Minister of Transport under section 3 of the Ministry of Transport Act.Pre- War Railway Travelling Concessions applicable to Military Personnel.Pre-war.Remarks.Present day.Remarks.Leave-Officers. Army Form 0.1798, entitling the holder to a return ticket on payment of single fare from cer-tain military stations to London only.2. Other ranks.

Nurses, soldiers&apos;wives and children under 16, Army School Mistresses, pupil teachers.   Army Form B. 295b, en-titling the holder to a return ticket on payment of the single fare.Memorial Services and Alili-tary Funerals  4. Parties of troops of 10 and upwards attending.   Were allowed return tickets on payment of single fare and a half. Journeys of this nature are not chargeable to Army Funds.These were purely rail-way concessions, i.e., the War Office was not called upon to refund the difference between the conces-sion fare and the full ordinary public rate.Soldiers&apos; families were only allowed one con-cession form per- year.Same as pre-war, ex-cept that until such time as the post-war military stations have been decided upon, the concession is available from all present military stations.Same as pre-war.Same as pre-war.Concessions 1 to 3 are now only honoured by the railway compauies on the distinct un-derstanding that either the War Office or the Ministry of Transport will refund them the difference between the concession fare and the full current public fare. As no provision for this has been made in Army Estimates this year, the Ministry of Trans-port has offered to bear the expenses from funds at their disposal for this year, and the War Office has asked the Treasury to agree to this.This was purely a fail-way concession .as above. During the war, Railway Execu-tive Committee agreed to continuance. A..C.L 2408 of 1916 laid down the conditions, and Army Warrants were issued on repay-,ment Credit to the public being given by the units concerned.This concession was afterwards extended to bands giving gratuitous-tous performances in aid of charity on con-ditions stated in A.C.i. 1825 of 1917.NilMinistry of Transport has notified the War Office that these concessions are not now being honoured by the railway companies.
The following pre-War Concessions were also in force, but they do not appear to have been arranged by the War Office, nor were Army Forms used in connection therewith.Pre-war.Remarks.Present day.Remarks.Royal Tournament-5. Competitors, teams, working parties, horses, guns, &amp;c, were conveyed at single fare for the double journey.*6. The London and South Western Railway Com-pany allowed soldiers proceeding on leave to London from Alder-shot a return ticket on payment of the single fare when travelling in uniform. No voucher was neces-sary to obtain this concession.A similar concession was allowed by the South Eastern and Chatham Railway from Alder shot (Ash) and Chatham to London.Rifle clubs 7. Soldiers in uniform proceeding for shooting practice were allowed a re-turn ticket on pay-ment of single fare and a third.Boys at Military Schools  8. Boys of Duke of York&apos;s, Royal Hi-bernian and Queen Victoria^ Military Schools Allowed return ticket on payment of half the single third class fare when going on holiday.The arrangements for this concession were made with the railway companies by the Chairman and Board of the Tournament who drew up the form of voucher to be used and made all payment to the companies.Brought to the notice of the War Office by the Secre-tary, Royal Tourna-ment.This was purely a rail-way concession ar-ranged locally as a commercial under-taking and the War office was not con-cerned.Brought to our notice by General Officer Commanding, Aldershot Command.This followed the con-cession allowed to civilian rifle clubs when members were proceeding to take part in competitions. It was not arranged by War Office and no voucher was neces-sary.This was purely a railway concession. During the war the Railway Executive Committee agreed to its re-introduction, and in 1915 notified railway companies accordingly.NilNilNilNilThis concession has been in force for a considerable number of years, but this year the railway companies refused to continue it. In consequence of this, the Secretary of the Tournament requested the War Office to take the matter up with the Ministry of Transport, but that department declined to direct the railway companies to reconsider their attitude.General Officer Commanding, Aldershot Command, asked whether the London and South Western Railway will revive this concession, and the matter has been referred to the company. After an interval of two months, London and South Western Railway replied saying the matter should be referred to Ministry of Transport. Ministry of Transport written to and reply now awaited.In consequence of an applica-tion from London District in May ,1919, Railway Executive Committee was approached by War Office to allow soldiers return tickets at single fare for return journey for this service. The Railway Execu-tive Committee agreed. Army Form W. 5117 was used in this connection, but the concession was with-drawn 1st May, 1920. Ministry of Transport will not allow it to continue.Ministry of Transport have notified War Office that this concession is not now being allowed by railway com-panies.
