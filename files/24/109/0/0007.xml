e fit-THIS DQCPlflBPT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANKIO MJ2STY!S GOVERNMENT). SECRET.-Memorandum by the First Commissioner of Works..I ben to refer to the Conclusions of Cabinet Meeting 5 (20) of the Slat January last, and I append herewith a letter Which I  &apos; have received from Sir Edwin Lutyens in regard to the Cabinet decision that silk flags and hot dyed stone should be used for &apos; the permanent Cenotaph,I have to point out that in my capacity of First Commissioner of ITorks, and the responsible Minister, I approved Sir. Edwin Lutyens1 design for the permanent Cenotaph on the 10th November, 1919, and on this authority Sir Ed::in Lutyens gave a commission to Professor Derwcnt Wood A.R.A., to model tho flags on the Cenotaph in stone according to tho drawings *    This - work-has accordingly been carried out and a considerable sum of money spent thereon.    The Cabinet,.in my absence, and without communl^ ,   eating either with me or with the Architect who designed theI   Cenotaph, on a Memorandum by the Minister of&apos;Agriculture andj .  jFisheries, came, to my mind, to the most unfortunate conclusion j   of altering thfta memorial by the use of silk flags. &apos; I have been waiting for air Edwin Lutyens&apos; return&apos;from india before taking this matter up; hence the delay which has taken place it will be seen from Sir Edwin&apos; Lutyens&apos;1 letter of the 1st July how entirely he objects to the conclusion.then arrived at.     I think his argument as to the illogical conse-quence,,from the artistic point of view, of substituting on the permanent Cenotaph the wreaths and ribbons in stone and the flags in flimsy textile material is - self-evident.    The temporaryCenotaph was made of plaster, the wreaths were made of actualthe flags were also made of material.     In the permanent monumentC A B I N E T.THE CENOTAPH *leaves, the ribbons were made of actual material and, logically,
the Cenotaph trill be of stone., the wreaths and ribbons-Trnrbe^ stone, and the only thing on this quiet monument which will be gptiroly out of keeping with it will be waving flags.Sir Mwin Lutyen3r authority on a point like this can surely not be in question.    Kis is the geniua which-has&quot;created this monument which has been univocally acclaimed.   . It    quite simple beautiful and dignified, and       whole reputation is naturally involved in the final result which will be obtained by it in a permanent form. . I cannot imagine that if -his strong views on this subject had been known ttoihe Cabinet at the time, they would have taken upon themselves the responsibility of altering the work of perhaps the greatest architectural genius in this Country. The Members of the Cabinet who came to the decision had probably not before them the beautiful treatment of the flags at rest, which add such great dignity to the entire memorial which Sir Edwin Lutyens had designed and which hag. now been carried out.It appears from the Cabinet Minutes that Sir Edwin Lutyona1. strong point of view was evidently not represented to the Cabinet and that, they were not aware of the fact that Sir Edwin Lutyons  * had given instructions for this work to be carried out as long ar;o as November 10th, 1919.&apos;    I very much regret that 1 am again placed in the unfortunate position, in dealing with artist iu matters, of having a decision, which it is within my province by virtue of my Office to determine, controverted by my colleagues without any reference to me,     It really would become impossible for myself or any other First Commissioner to continue his re-lations with the Artists of this Country if they find that they cannot rely oh the Head of that Department to whom they have to look as the responsible Minister in these matters.     I must most strongly ur^c that the Cabinet decision of January 21st be res-cindod and that.Sir Edwin Lutyens be allowed to complete the Cenotaph in accordance with the drawings to which I have given approval, and to the execution of which he attaches the very greatest importance in regard to;the success of the .Memorial.(Signed)   ALFRED H0M5.H.M. Office of Works.S.W.,.July 5th, 1920.-
Copy of letter from Sir&apos;Edwin L.Lutyena R.A.. to the Fijrso Commis-eioner bf Works..    - 17, Queen Anners Crate,Westminster, 3.W.I. 1st July, 1920*  .Dear Sir Alfred,On November 10th 1919 you approved my drawings for the permanent Cenotaph*Before I left for India I had seen the sketch models and in rood faith Professor Derwent Uood, a sculptor ofgreat distinction, a commission and since then ho has completed the models of the flags, endowing them with great dignity and repose,During my absence in India, the Cabinet reversed my decision approved by you Sir, that the flags and wreaths should be in the permanent Cenotaph of stone, and substituted silk material in place of stone for the flags.    This decision was come to without direct reference to myself.If the wreathe could have been left real, the decision would have been logical, but impracticable owing to the permanent charges that i?ould be entailed by replacing the wreaths tvV least every week or fortnight, and a-^ain after Inclement weather and storms,Stone wreaths and real flags will in my opinion, look incon^r^oTisand absurd, and cannot create the respect that should oe due to/&apos;permanent monument replacing the temporary Cenotaph,I have prepared a 3calc model which I have asked Professor Derwont V/ood to send to the Office of 7/orks, this week so that youttayapprociate the importance of my plea, which I make in all possible sincerity.
I have reported to&quot;Sir iTtinl^Ba^ matter- of costs and time for completion, which is affected^hy the decision I r,c\i ask you to obtain in favour of the tfhole monument be ins in permanent material.Yours very truly,(Sd.) m:ill L. LUTYENS*The Rt., lion;,Sir Alfred Mond, H.P,,&amp;c.
