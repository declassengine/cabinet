confidential . &apos;    -   mI desire to add a very feiv words to the Memoran-dum circulated by the Lord, President of the Council,y IP&apos; i(s6%  -    with every word of which 1 can in entire accord, and I only ask leave to say that the passage of the Irish 13ill through Parliament, notwithstanding the absence of the ordinary Opposition, is attended with very considerable difficulty.This arises from many causes, but the most troublesome obstacle is the persistent statement that the Government are not in earnest, that they have not - made up their mind, and that the Bill is liable either to have another substituted for it, or to be so materially altered that it would be unrecognisable.If there is to be any doubt a^ to our position in this respect it would be nuite impossible to proceed with the Bill, and I hope my colleagues will realise this fact,I would like to add that I have received repeated assurances from representatives of Ulster that they are now determined to have the Bill, that they mean to make the very best possible use of it, and they impress upon&apos;me that any hesitation on the part of the Government to proceed with the measure in its present form would be attended with the gravest consequences in Ulster,I therefore most heartily associate myself with the views expressed by the Lord President of the Council,   I hope that the unfortunate and extra- : ordinary views tendered to the Cabinet on Friday will be rejected, and that we will n;o steadily forward with our Bill and send it to the House of Lords as early in the adiournsid Session as may be possible.(intd.) W. H, L. 5, VII. 20. &apos;
