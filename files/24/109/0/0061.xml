RESrase.1HE PRESENT INDUSTRIAL SITUATION&quot;.Memorandum by tho Minister off Labour1,1*    Theare are one or two features about the present, industrial situation, which ought, I think, to be brought to the; notl&amp;r of my colleagues.   It is at all.  times &amp;yv$m$djagX$ xiifXicult -to forecast the development of laboxir-moveraejrta, and for that reason I do r-ot propose to attempt to indicate the way in whioh events may shape themselves within the next tew weeks\ but as the Recess is drawing near It may be advisable that I should-touch briefly upon some of the considerations which incline me to the view that a difficult situation may have to be faoed in the comparatively near future.2.    Perhaps the most disquieting feature in the situation isthe lack of control over their members of the offlolals of theTrades Unions,   instances of this may be seen- in the recent disputesaleoting tramway employees and gas workers, and in the px^esentdispute affecting printers.   In all these cases, after protractednegotiations, the Central,Exeoutives of the Unions-succeeded in arriving at a settlement on a national- basis.   In various districts of the country -the lo-cal men declined to accept the nationalsettlements   In the case of the trams, the employers gave way, firstin one district and then in another,- and in the end, instead of thenational settlement of 6s/-. per week, the local movements succeededi -In obtaining,   for practically the whole country, an advance of 9s/-a week.   It remains to be seen what will be the result of the break away in certain   districts on the part of the gas workers. But)it is significant that in order to obtain a resumption of work at Manchester a Trade Union leader of the standing of Mr. dynes has been obliged to promise the men that ho will go back to the employers;/withm   1   w
with a view to getting an improved settlement.   The terras of this 0promise are rather significant and arewarth recording here.   &quot;IJT, after work being returned, the Regional Council does not reach decisions which the men are prepared to accept * Mr. Clynes--\wdear^^ to support the men in their desire to cease work to enforce claims which the men can accept&quot;.A public declaration of this kind by so important a leader as Mr. Clynes, who has shown such courage against the extremists in the past, is disquieting.   It will certainly not be without its effect upon Employers.   To concede to the men as a result of direct action more than Employers are prepared to concede to the leaders, 1$ not only fatal to all discipline within the Trade ^,. Unions.   Xt will create the impression that negotiations between employers1 and workmen1a representatives are not final but only steps on the way, with all the attendant risks and chaos which must follow such a policy   In the oaae of the printers, the employers at the. moment are taking a firm etan4 and are threatening a national lock-out as a result of the breakaway at Manchester and Liverpool.There appears to be a disposition on the part of a number of the engineering trade districts to revive a form of agitation which existed during the war, but which latterly has subsided -under which local movements for advances in wages are initiated and pressed by the local officials without very maoh regard for the Central Sxeoutives.   The national awards which have been given periodically by the Industrial Court have kept this movement in abeyanoef beoause although those awards have given less than the amounts asked tw by the Oenfcral Executives and very much leas than the amounts claimed by the local men, they have nevertheless given (^sufficient to take the sting out of a threatened local break-away. The award just issued withholding any further advance is bound to give an impetus to the local agitations, and lt may be that there will be^trouble.l/?A544
3.    Apart from the big national movements many employers have expressed irritations at the many attempts made in the shops to put forward what they regard as unreasonable claims j thus at Sheffield at the present time the Electrical Trades Union have brought about a strike because they insist that a particular individual, stated by the employers to be a foreman, shall join the Union,   Considerable heat has been generated by this incident, which has assumed proportions sufficiently large to necessitate consideration by the Employers&apos; Federation^   Quite apart from the question of principle Involved in the claim that a foreman shall be a member of the same Union as the men whom he is supervising (a Question of great (&amp;l  iculty), the employers take the view that the Electrical Trades Union are acting unconstitutionally in bringing out a strike,   And in view of the methods whioh have been adopted by this Union for some considerable time past there is a growing body of opinion amongst Employers that sooner or later there must be a fight*   The Sheffield incident has been considered by the Employers&apos; Federation and it is likely that they will threaten a national lock-out - a threat which will lie carried out unless the Electrical Trades Union give way.   A somewhat similar situation exists at Manchester, where the maintenance engineers employed in the engineering shops are refusing to work overtime (a refusal which is bound shortly  to throw the maohinea idle) in order yto press- a demand for an advance a 9d. per hour (55s/-,a weeak).   Here again, the Employers take the view that a stopple of owrtime whenr negotiations are in progress is unwarrantable.   These two instances and others of a   similar character cause an amount of feeling which I cannot view without apprehension,oxists4,    On the part of the men unrest/ in a number of trades by reason of the extent to which wages in the building trade have beoh advanced beyond the level of wages in neighbouring industries. It is the case at the present lime that an unskilled man such as
the bricklayer^ labour is in receipt of a higher v.go than tho fitter or tumor or similar olass of skilled man in tho engineering and allied trades who has served a long apprenticeship.   I need not in this memorandum dwoll upon the condition of the building trade because that is a matter which has been boforo my colleagues on numerous occasions recently.   But it will readily be appreciated how hard it is for men such as engineers, millwrights, printers and others, to be content with their own rates of wagos when labourers with whom they are brought in contact are being paid at rates above their own.5.   The unrest is accentuated by the belief that large profits are still being made; this belief is encouraged by the oxtent to which opposition has been shown to the lilxcess Profits Duty, and also by the importance which the Chancellor of the Exchequer attaches publicly to the continuance of this duty because of the large amounts which it brings into the Exchequer.   The claim of the miners that if profits are being made in an industry they ought properly to be divided between the worker, by an advance of wages, and the consumers by a decrease in prices, illustrates an attitude of mind which exists in other sections of the labour movement and cannot be ignored.6*   In the cartage industrys a key industry in which a stoppage would affect most other industries;, there is-- a breakdown in negotiations upon a claim for an advance in wages.   The employers have stated that they are not in a position either to pay the advance themselves or to pass on the charge to the consumer.   The men reply by asking that the employers should submit evidence, by the submission of books and documents, as to their inability to pass on tho cost or to bear the cost themselves.   The employers have declined to submit this evidence and at the moment there is a deadlocksA 546
$Ms question of profits - their existence and their disclosure ris likely, I think, to assume considerable dimensions in futurelabour negotiations, although perhaps in the present instancethe case is not a clear one.by reason of the fact that theemployers, against whom the claim has been made, represent onlya small proportion of the industry, the majority of the employersbeing small firms who do not belong to the employers&apos; organisations7(;   There are at present no clear indications that the slump in trade is likely to advance so quickly as to cause widespreadunemployment except in a limited number of trades, but on theother hand there is a good deal of evidence, notably in the shipbuilding and certain branches of the engineering trades,that the flow of orders has greatly diminished within the last few weeks with the consequence that although, owing to theexistence of orders taken some time previously3 work is being maintained at full pressure, the falling off in orders is likelyto lead either to short time or to unemployment in a number ofcentres in the relatively near future.   It may be that knowledgeof the anticipated decline in trade may act as a moderatinginfluence upon labour leadens generally, and that on the part ofemployers there will remain a sufficiently large body of moderate opinion to prevent anything in the nature ofaggressive action,Put unless some steadying^Jjifluences prevail on both sides wecannot, I fear, hope to avoid a breakdown in one or more of theprominent trades *   We have been able ^by conciliation to tide overa great many difficult situations within the past eighteen months.But there is a limit to what can be done by conciliation-,I have made no comment on the situation so far as it affects the miners because that obviously is a matter with which thePresident of the Board of Trade will wish to deal personally.(Initialed.)
