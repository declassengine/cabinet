In reply to your telegram dated 5th July, No. 2331.Estimation of five months was based on number of men and horses that can travel from post to post at one time owing to water difficulties, and also included a month&apos;s notice. The urgency of a rapid withdrawal has been impressed upon all concerned, and no effort will be spared to make it as rapid as possible. We hope to complete in less than four months from zero day. Everything is ready for commencement of withdrawal, and zero day will now be fixed and notified to you shortly. We have been awaiting reply to our question regarding disposal of stores, as considerable loss of money may be involved if withdrawal were commenced without definite orders having been issued as regards their disposal. In view of your telegram quoted above we shall now, however, order withdrawal to commence, and will make the best arrangements we can for disposal of stores. Pending reply from Tehran to telegram sent by Foreign Office, we propose to collect at Meshed bulk of stores now at Birjand and northwards for subsequent disposal as may be arranged by you.
