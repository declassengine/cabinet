(Intd, ) A.C,Treasury, S.W.July  2nd, 1920.
3 5 irish RAILWAYS. Memorandum by Sir Hardman  ever.With reference to Sir Hamar Greenwood^ Memorandum dated 20th instant (C.P* 1657) suggesting that Government should insist upon Irish Railways closing down unless theft-cm fulfil their obligations as common carriers in regard to Government traffic, I am informally advised by the Solicitor to the Ministry of Transport that in the circumstances contemplated the Railway Companies would probably continue to be entitled to the benefit of the Compensation Clause in the Railway Agreement guaranteeing them net receipts of 1913, on the ground that their inability to deal with Government traffic is due, not to circumstances over which they have control, but to the inadequacy of the protection for their men that Government is able to provide,The adoption of Sir Hamar Greenwoodfs proposal^ would therefore be at the cost of Government to the extent of the whole of the Irish railways net revenue of 1913 plus their gross expenditure, during the period of inaction.I realise of course that this may be a minor consideration in relation to the desirability of bringing the force of public opinion to bear upon the situation.(Signed) g.
