HIS DOCITOMT IS THE PROPERTY OF IHS. MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT ,)5 G RET. - COPY HO,   W,CAB7JET.. P.   1636. .:THE IRISH SITUATION COMOTTEE. Note by Mr- Long.The Irish Situation Committee held its Third Meeting in the House of Commons on Thursday, July l^th, and had the advant-age of the presence of Lord   Mdleton, Lord Dasart, and Mr. Jellett., the Member for Dublin University.   These three gentle-men were asked to state their views on the Irish Situation fully and frankly, and further, to make any practical suggestions re-- garding any steps, which, in their opinion, the Government might take to restore law and order in Ireland.&apos;   The. suggestions of Lord Millet on and Lord Desart are attached as an Appendix.I should perhaps tell the Cabinet that the impression left on my mind was that all three seemed to be harassed by the fear that the Government was not absolutely sincere and genuine in its desire to put down lawlessness in Ireland.   I feel con-confident, however, that as a result of their meeting with the Committee, and especially with the Chief Secretary, (who fortunately was able to be present) they are convinced that thei;; view of the attitude of the Government was mistaken.   It is im-portant, however, to remember that they were only voicing the thoughts and feelings of a by no means inconsiderable section of public opinion and, in spite of the fact that the Prime Minister has repeatedly stated in public the determination of th Government to use all the means in its power to restore order in Ireland, the Committee is inclined to think that a further 0 pronouncement by the Prime Minister :of the Government&apos;s policy would have a considerable effect..   This might be Question and Answer in the House?I think I should add that Lord MHidleton,, Lord Desart an Mr. Jellett were unanimously of the opinion that unless the
situation ih Ireland was well in hand &quot;before the month 6f October&apos;, the chances of the Government being able to c6j?e with it would be almost hopeless.   Their reason for this view being ihat. a large number of the loyal supporters Bf the Government in Ireland would have lost faith and have gone over; to Sinn Fein, before that date., ,(Intd..)   W   H. L.16th July, 1920.
In the course cf conversation the following points were mentioned as to the present condition of affairs in Ireland:-A latter from LORD SLIGO was read allowing that at Westport. Co. Mayo, flour is issued&apos;ooly on a permit from tho head of the Sinn Fein organisation, and that all carts delivered were examined by S.F. to ascertain that they had permits.    Tho S.F. Arbitration Court was held on Friday every week at the Town akali, the President of the Court &quot;being the Chairman of the County Council.    An SVF. Urban Council had been formed which had struck a rate, which rate was being levied by the official rate collector*    A rate was also being levied for the maintenance of all railway servants discharged.The fact that such courts were being held unchallenged all over the Country in various districts was corroborated by Lord Dosart and Mr. Jellett.    Lord Pesart produced cuttings from newspapers which showed that they were now&apos; regularly reported.    In his district the magistrates had in some cases failed to attand Petty Sessions, and in other districts not merely were Potty Sessions neglected, but instances were given of all the cases being withdrawn from the AssizestLORD M2DLET0H said that he and Lord Desart had an interview with Lord French in April, and had pressed upon him that there was then no regular system of patrols, or proper co-operation between the military and police and that the places attacked being vacated the Government were only controlling the towns and
leaving the Country to S*F.   Since April tho &quot;policy had ,j been changed, patrols had been established, and some posts had been occupied by troops, but soldiers had apparently not been successful in a single instance, and In one or two notable cases, as that of a patrol of 16 men near Kidleton and the case cf the General and two officers recently captured by S,F., cu3p:ble laxity had beer apparent.   How could people believe the Government was in earnest unless such cases were dfia.lt with?Lord Mi die tor    said that there was no cbubt an erroneous idea inat the soldiers had been ordered not to shoot.   He suggested that this was probably due to the fact that for purpose of quelling disorder they could        use their weapons if called upon by the civil; power?   If that were so it became necessary to establish Martial Law, and either soldiers should be put in the position to use their weapons or they should be withdrawn. If a single case occurred in which a dozen of the assailants were badly injured further attacks would be unlikely,   He, therefore, first asked for the establishment of Martial Law or the equivalent, and secondly for the suppression of the Republican Courts by a Special Commission, or otherwise Thirdly, he asked that in every case where railway-men refused to carry troops they should be discharged and kept out of all railway employment, and that if a crisis in tram port resulted the crisis should be faced,   He urged that if such measures were not promptly taken and the necessary legiS&quot; lation carried before the end of this Session the time would havt passed.   It was already very late, but a striking blow would greatly influence S.F., whom, he had reason to know, feared nothing so much as a trial of strength with the Government,Lord Midleton further added that the Increase of out-rages in the last few days- in which six police had been murdered and^twelve injured, a caretaker shot dead, a land agent fired at and the General Post Office raided made his-friends apprehend that S.F.- would extend-their operations until they had sufficien ly impressed the Government, and would attack country houses
and selected land-lords.,   Some of his.friends.,&apos;had.,.had grave warning g aMr*Jellett associated himself with every word which.had&apos; fallen from Lord Midietcn and Lord Daea^tjLord Desart agreed generallyj but was not entirely convinced that Martial Law was the best solution.   It might be that full exercise of the powers   under the Defence of the Realm Act would act equally favourably   He knew that the withdrawal of the patrols before General Macreadj-took--office had been unfortunate in his part of the world.Lord Desart also agreed with Mr,JelIett and Lord . Midleton that the loyal population in the South and&apos;West felt the time had come when they must know whether the Government intended to master the Country or they would be forced to make terms with S,F,   They had got to live in the Country and were under extraordinary pressure,   He gave instances of cases, when no redress could be obtained from, the ordinary courts and no protection from the Government, where the loyalists had applied to the S,F-, courts and been well treated.   Lord Desart asked whether those who went to ScF* courts for the protection of life or property or to obtain the necessaries of iife would be treated or considered as offenders.   This question was being asked by many in Ireland-who desire to act loyally, but can only in this way get protection*2, Whitehall gardens.; S,^l. July 17th,19200
