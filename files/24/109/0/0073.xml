CABINET, Committee of Home AffairsCIYII SERVICE CONSCIENTIOUS QBJECTORS.    &apos; Memorandum by the Financial Secretary to the Treasury. Reference H.A.C.64, Minute 3.The Home Affairs Committee have already had under.p.    consideration a memorandum containing the Treasury proposals 1331.for the present and future treatment of Civil Service Conscientious Objectors, (H,A.C. 64th Minutes) and decided that the Treasury^should reconsider, the whole question in the light .of the Committee1s discussion and submit fresh proposals in due course.I have now had an opportunity of looking further into the question with the Treasury Officials concerned and &quot;think it will bo for the convenience of the Committee that I should state quite briefly the facts of the case.We are not concerned with men who did not satisfy the Central Tribunal as being genuinely conscientious in their objection to military service, or who having been passed by the Tribunal subsequently misbehaved.      The. Home Affairs Committee agree with the Treasury that these men should be definitejfcy dismissed.V7e are now concerned only with Civil Service Conscientious Objectors who satisfied the Tribunal and complied with all the conditions laid down in consequence of the statutory provisions made in their case and who are eligible for re-employment under instructions issued in virtue of the decision of the Home Affairs Committoe of 1st August last, or have already under these instructions been re-employed in the Civil Service.    The total number involved is  30, of whom 176 have actually been re-employed.The question et issue is whether these 176 men now employed in their Departments on a temporary footingshall/
shall he retained indefinitely  in a temporary-vc&amp;pa&amp;ity or be reinstated on the pensionable establishment *   - The. &apos;  &apos; decision given in theso cases will necessarily apply also to the other persons nor: under consideration, who instead of continuing at work in their Departments, took up work of National importance as prescribed by the Tribunal and are eligible for employment under the same conditions as have been prescribed or may now be prescribed for the men&apos; who continued at work-in thoir own Departments*These men have done all that they were obliged by the law to do&apos;.    They have not been dismissed from their Departments but have been treated for purposes of increment amd pension as though they were on leave without pay.   - In my Judgment the only alternative now presented to us are, either to dismiss them from the Service or to restore then as from some appointed date, say 1st April, 1920, to the pensionable establishment,     I do not think it possiMe^ In all the circumstances , to adopt the first of these alternativesj   nor do I think it possible to retain these men indefinitely in the Service on a temporary footing. They are filling, or would be filling if they were reinstated under regulations already in force, permanent positions in. the Civil Service&apos;. .    The Governaent have accepted without qualification the principle that persons holding permanent positions in the Clerical or Administrative Branches of the Civil Service should hold their appointments on a permanent and pensionable footing.     It would be clean contrary to this principle to create a new class of persons who, although employed   on a permanent footing, were yet to serve in an - unpensionable capacity*The men whose cases are now under consideration are/mostly
mostly employees-of-the Post Office..    There is in that department a strong feeling.on the part of the staff atlar-jjo in favour of. complete reinstatement,.   So far as other Departments are concerned,, tho problem is a small not$no and I have/hoard that in these Departments any opposition by the staff to the course now proposed need boanticipated..    Tho procedure proposed la substantially the same as has bean adopted by the London County Counciland by other large employers of labour.In the previous memorandum the suggestion wasmade that whilst the time served by these people between thedate of their suspension and the date of their completereinstatement should not; reckon for pension, it might fairly be allowed to count for increment.    I think, on furtherconsideration, that this surest ion perhaps  oes beyond- the merits of the case.    To disallow, the.time- for purposes ofincrement will of course put the people.whom we are now considering at a very Great disadvantage in comparison withthe Civil Service Conscientious Objectors who were draftedCorpsto the Kon-Comba* ant/and retained their full Civil rights..    But taking everything into account, I should be disposed to Jbroat increment and pension in the same way, i*e to exclude the period of service on leave without pay for those purposes..(Initialled)     S..3,Treasury, S.U.July 21at,1920.
