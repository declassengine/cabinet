HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTYTS O0V3RNM3NT.10NFIDENTIALSUPERAMlNig/igiOH OP L()(u&apos;AL GOv^R:?M5NT OFFICERS.     L.G.33. MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER OF HEALTH.- ^y Annexed is the Report made by a Departmental&quot;Committee on the Superannuation of Persons employed by Local Authorities in England and Wales,There has for many years been a strong movement -an the part of local authorities and their officers, whose position and duties are in many respects analogous to those of Civil Servants, for the provision of a superannuation scheme for the local government service.    It was decided in-1914 to appoint a Committee to inquire into the subject, but the war intervened and it was not until 1918 that the Committeo was set up.The Committee; report in favour of a general contributory scheme under which local funds would be constituted^ on a common basis fbr the payment of superannuation allowances in respect of the future service of all permanent employees of local authorities, the funds being formed by equal contributions from officers and local authorities at the combined rate of 10$ upon the pensionable salaries or wages.The Report has been considered by the principal Associations of Local Authorities and their officers.    The criticisms which they have made upon it do not, I think, provide material ground for the revision of the Committee&apos;s recommendations.    There are, however, three points of importance which require to be mentioned, as they are likely to lead to acute discussion when legislation is introduced (1) Financial assistance from the Exchequer.
But for the introduction of the Teachers Pension Scheme, which is entirely financed by the Government, It ia unlikely that this question would have been raised. It is discussed in paragraphs 34 to 39 of the Report, and the conclusion reached by the committee  is that, while in cases where a service Is grant-aided the superannuation contributions paid by a local authority in respect of any officer should be met from the grant as well as and in the same proportion as his salary, there are no good grdunds for any further contribution from the Treasury.    I do not suggest any departure from the Committee^ recommendations. Indeed I think the contribution which they propose should, pending a general revision of the system of local grants, be paid only in cases in which the amount of grant is definitely related! to (e.g,50$ of) the amount of the local expenditure on a particular service.(2.)   Past services of officers and officers who are already too old to enter a contributory pension scheme.The salient fact about past service Is that salaries have been paid upon the basis that there will be no pension,  end that the officer will provide for his own old age.     It is, however, also, true that in many oases the officer has not done so and that in consequence the service suffers-, as a local authority is unwilling to condemn an old servant to real or comparative poverty.In these circumstances the proposal of the Committee: that a local authority may pay in respect of past service one half of the ordinary rate of pension payable under the contributory scheme (i*e. so much as would have been represented by the contributions of the local authority) with
1IIpower to increase the amount in particular cases represents a compromise that may fairly be adoptee1 for general application. (3)   Central Fund.The National Association of Local Government Officers, which represents a large proportion of the . officers of local authorities and is a most responsible and influential body, press strongly for the establishment of a single Central Fund for the superannuation of the offieer3 of all the local authorities in the country, instead of the local funds recommended by the Committee., and some of the Associations of Local Authorities also favour a Central Fund.   The Commit &quot;tee discuss the question fully in Section VI of the Report, and state (paragraph 80) &quot;it was only with reluctance that we gave up the idea of a single fund, of the impracticability of which we were finally convinced.&quot;     As they pointed out in paragraph 74 of   their Report, &quot;either the separate authorities would have to submit to the control of a central body responsible for the management and solvency.of the fund - and this they would v?armly repudiate - or the solvency of the fund would be at the mercy of their separate action without their having individually more than an indirect and remote responsibility for it.&quot;      I think the Government must adopt tho finding of the Committee.I am satisfied that the position is one in which action is urgently required.     The pressure in favour of superannuation schemes is so general that numerous local authorities are considering or actually promoting by Private Bill schemes applicable to their own officers, and each new separate scheme, while open to objection in itself as checking the mobility of the service, makes more difficult the introduction of a co-ordinating scheme.        To illustrate the confusion which already exists I may refer especially-to paragraphs 8 to 10 of the Committee^ Report,     The following extract (from paragraph 26) deserves reproduction : -
&quot;Under the public general statutes at present in force the town clerk of a borough in London my be superannuated but not the town clerk of a borough out-side London; the medical officer of a poor-law infirmary is entitled to superannuation while the medical officer of health of an extra-metropolitan county cannot be given a superannuation allowance by his council; the accountant to the visiting coinmiteee of a lunatic asylum is entitled to superannuation but not the accountant to a hospital board&quot;; a rate collector appointed by a board of guardians is entitled to superannuation but not a rate collector appointed by an urban district council.   A librarian may be super-annuated in Poplar but not in East Ham; a sanitary inspector may be superannuated in Stepney but not in Southend; nurses in the hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board for infectious disease may be superannuated but not those in the corresponding hospitals in Leeds. This situation, which appears to U3 indefensible, will become worse, if, as is contemplated, the staffs of boards of guardians, already entitled to superannuation, are added to the staffs of county and county borough councils whom those councils have no power to superannuate.&quot;If my colleagues concur I propose that the Parliamentary Counsel should be instructed to proceed with the preparation of a Bill to give effect to the recommendations of the Committee and that the Bill should be introduced as soon as possible with a view to its early enactment.It will probably be thought better that the position of officers of the Scottish Local Government should be dealt with In a separate Bill.It should be mentioned that the employees of local Insurance Committees are pressing for a superannuation scheme. Their case however is distinct from that of the employees of local authorities (i,e. authorities having power to raise money by rates), and the future of insurance committees is not sufficiently clear to enable action to be recommended in their case at the present time.C ADD ISON. 14. 7. 1920.MINISTRY OF HEALTH.

report. i)REPORT.To the RiGiir ITonouiuule Christopher A.ddi80n, M.D., M.P., Minister of Heai/w. Sir,X. We have the honour to submit herewith our Report and Recommendations,Section I-Introduction.2. We were appointed to consider whether it is desirable to introduce a scheme of superannuation applicable to the persons in the employment of local authorities in England and. Wales, and, if so, to make recommendations on the subject with special reference to the following points (a) The finance and general working of any such scheme.(b) Classes of officials or employees which it should embrace.(c) Its relation to any existing superannuation scheme.3. We desire, in the first place, to point out that but for the war an inquiry into this subject would have been held five years ago. In the summer of 1914 steps in that direction were taken by the Right Hon. Herbert Samuel, M.P., then President of the Local Government Board, who had before him various proposals relating to the superannuation of persons employed by local authorities, including a proposal, made by the National Association of Local Government Officers, for the creation of a national fund to which all local authorities and all the persons employed by them were to contribute and from which all superannuation charges in respect of those persons were to be met. On the declaration of war the selection of an investigating body was postponed. In the spring of 1918, however, the Right Hon. W. Hayes Fisher, M.P. (now Lord Downham), who had. in the meantime become President of the Local Government Board, consulted the Association of Municipal Corporations, the County Councils&apos; Association, the Urban District Councils&apos; Association, and the Rural District Councils&apos; Association, with reference to the proposed national fund, and indicated to them that his own view was that, if certain difficulties arising out of the state of war could be overcome, it would be desirable at once to appoint an expert committee to investigate &quot;this intricate and difficult subject&quot; rather than to defer the inquiry until after the war. The Associations mentioned were not unanimous in thinking an immediate investigation practicable; and it was not until the 19th October 1918 that the Committee was appointed by Mr. Hayes Fisher.4. Our first meeting took place on the 31st October 1918, and we have, in all, held 26 meetings, of which 11 have been occupied mainly with the examination of witnesses, and 15 have been devoted mainly to the discussion and consideration of the questions referred to us.We have heard 27 witnesses, representing the local authorities, the persons employed by them, and others. A list of the witnesses is given in Appendix I. We have also received and have carefully considered written communications addressed to us by the individuals and bodies named in Appendix. II.H.M. Treasury, the Home Office, the Board of Education, the Board of Inland Revenue, the Board of Control, the Local Government Board, the Local Government Board for Ireland, and the Secretary of the Railway Clearing System Superannuation Fund Corporation have assisted us in regard to specific points which we referred to them.We are indebted to the Government Actuary&apos;s Department for the calculations which provide the actuarial basis of our Report.5. It will be observed from the terms of the Minute of Appointment that persons employed by local authorities in Scotland and Ireland are outside the scope of our inquiry. Moreover, although the terms of the Minute are perhaps wide enough to cover every class of persons employed by local authorities in England and Wales, we have not thought it necessary, in view of the passing, shortly after the date of our appointment, of the School Teachers (Superannuation) Act, 19.18, to consider any question affecting teachers who are pensionable under, that Act. And, by arrangement, we have left any detailed inquiry which may be necessary into the superannuation of the police to the Departmental Committee which the Home Secretary appointed to consider and report whether any and what changes should be made in the method of recruiting for, the conditions of service of,&apos;&apos;and the rates of pay, pensions, and allowances of the police forces of England, Wales and Scotland.Apart from these two classes-teachers pensionable under the Act of 1918 and the police we have regarded all persons employed by local authorities in England and Wales as coming within the scope of our investigation.a 3
6, For the purpose of our inquiry we have taken the term &quot;local authorities &quot; to mean (as in the Local Loans Act, 1875) authorities having the power to levy-directly or indirectly  assessed rates the proceeds of which are applicable to public local purposes, and, for the sake of convenience, we have used the word &quot;officers&quot; to designate persons (whether officers or workmen) in the service of local authorities. Similarly, we have used&apos; the term &quot; Central Department&quot; to designate the Government Department exercising jurisdiction in regard to the financial affairs of local authorities.Section II-Historical survey.General.7. Local authorities have, in general, power to appoint necessary officers, to fix and vary their scales of remuneration, and to dismiss them.   But, as a rule, they have no power to -grant superannuation allowances at the expense of the local rates, although (i) certain classes of officers are everywhere pensionable and (ii) certain local authorities have been empowered to superannuate all their officers.8. The persons to whom, in virtue of the character of their occupation, Parliament lias authorised local, authorities to grant pensions at the expense of the rates are (i) The police,(ii) Poor-hw officers,(iii) Asylums officers, and(iv) Officers in institutions provided under the Mental Deficiency Act, 1913.9. The local( authorities who have been empowered by Parliament to superannuate all their officers are (i) Local authorities to whom the provisions of the Superannuation (Metropolis) Act,1866, apply, viz., the London County Council, the metropolitan borough councils, and the Metropolitan Water Board ; and(ii) The corporations of some of the larger provincial boroughs [e.g., Birmingham,Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle-upon-Tyne) and a small number of other local authorities &apos;Ke.g., the Urban District Councils of Chiswick and Southgate), who have applied for and obtained local Acts dealing with the matter.The London County Council, the Metropolitan Water Board, and several of the metro-politan borough councils, to whom the provisions of the Superannuation (Metropolis)&apos; Ac,t, 1866, apply, have (in circumstances which we shall mention later) also obtained special powers by local Acts to establish superannuation funds.10. Thus, except in the cases referred to in. paragraphs 8 and 9, the under-mentioned classes of local authorities have no power to superannuate any of their officers:County councils,Town councils of boroughs outside London, Urban district councils, ;        . Rural district councils, Parish councils,Joint hospital boards or committees, , ,, Joint sewerage boards or committees, ; ,      . Joint water boards or committees, andOverseers and other minor local authorities.11. This position is the result of a mass of piecemeal legislation stretching from the Metropolitan Police Act, 1829, to the Asylums and Certified Institutions (Officers Pensions) Act, 1918.- This period of 90 years has witnessed many great changes affecting the local government of the country. Municipalities, poor-law authorities, highway authorities, county authorities, and metropolitan authorities, have, in turn, been subjects of parliamentary inquiry and reform, and the local public health service has been created. But there has hitherto been no general inquiry into the subject of the superannuation of the numerous officers whom the local authorities employ. During the same period the superannuation systems of the Civil Service have thrice been reviewed as a whole, and have been consolidated and amended.The police.12, The earliest of the Acts we have mentioned The Metropolitan Police Act, 1829,  established in London the modern police force in lieu of the local establishments of nightly watch and nightly police which, according to the preamble to the Act, had &quot;been found inadequate.by reason of the frequent unfitriess of; the individuals employed.&quot; The Act  presumably in order to guard against a repetition of the same unfitness in members of the new &apos;force-provided for the payment of &quot;an allowance to such&quot; members thereof &quot;as shall be disabled by bodily injury received, or shall Jap wprn out by length of service.&quot;   In 1839 this
provision was developed by the establishment of a police superannuation fund, resembling the superannuation funds at that time in operation in some of the Government Departments, and, like them, deriving its income partly from certain fees, fines, and, miscellaneous receipts diverted into the fund, and partly from deductions made, at rates not exceeding 2  per cent., from salaries and wages! At later dates similar funds were set up for each of the county and borough police forces, and power was obtained to charge upon the rates any deficiencies arising in the funds. A Select Committee of the House of Commons which reported in 1877 (Park Paper No. 158 of 1877) recommended that police pensions should be made&apos;&quot;&apos;a direct charge upon the rates, protecting the men by a fixed scale and by appeal.&quot; Up to 1890 the giving or refusing of a pension, both in the metropolitan and provincial forces, was within the discretion of the employing authorities, but in that year an Act was passed giving to all members of the police forces a legal right to pensions under certain defined conditions, with an appeal to a legal tribunal against the withholding or the forfeiture, for alleged misconduct, of the pensions. A Government grant of 300,0001. a year in aid of the cost of police pensions was given in the year 1890, and continued without alteration of amount until the year 1918, when it was increased,Poor-law officers.13. The reform of the Poor Law in 1834 was followed, in 1843, by proposals for the creation of a fund out of which provision might be made for aged masters of workhouses and &quot; such (masters) as were incapacitated, by sickness or accident, for the discharge of their duties,&quot; and the possibility of forming such a fund on the lines of the then recently esta-established Metropolitan Police Superannuation Fund was suggested.In 1850, after the matter had been further canvassed, the Poor Law Board circulated among the union officers throughout the country the draft of a Bill providing for the establisli-ment for those officers of a superannuation fund to be built up solely out of compulsory deductions from the salaries of the officers to whom it applied ; but it became clear that the &quot; officers differed widely and irreconcileably among themselves as to the policy and justice of the proposed measure,&quot; and the Board, being of opinion that a measure &quot; founded upon the principle of a compulsory deduction from all salaries ought not&apos; to be passed against the will of any considerable number of the officers,&quot; dropped the Bill In 1857 a Royal Commission, appointed to inquire into the operation of the Civil Service Superannuation Act, 1834, laid the foundations for the Civil Service Superannuation Act of 1859, which swept away the contributory funds referred to in paragraph 12 as existing in that Service ; and the Government in 1864 introduced and passed a Bill, modelled to some extent on that Act, empowering boards of guardians, at their discretion, with the consent of the Poor Law Board, to grant to any officer whose whole time had been devoted to the service&apos;of the union or parish, and who should become incapable of discharging the duties of his office with efficiency, by reason of permanent infirmity of mind or body, or of old age, upon his resigning or other-wise ceasing to hold office, an annual allowance not exceeding in any case two-thirds of his then salary, and to charge such allowance on the rate on which the other expenses of the guardians were charged. The Act further provided that &quot; no officer shall be entitled to such allowance on the ground of age who shall not have completed the full age of 60 years, and shall,not have served as an officer of some union or parish for 20 years at the least.&quot; (27 &amp; 28 Viet. c. 42.J Women as Avell as men were within the terms of the Act, but part-time officers were excluded. In 1870 a Bill, introduced by a private member, was passed empowering boards of guardians to give to part-time poor-law medical officers the benefits obtainable under the Act oil 1864 by&apos; whole-time officers. As no scale of allowances was prescribed by the Act of 1864, the Local Government Board (who had taken over the powers, &amp;c, of the Poor Law Board) found it requisite to lay down some rules on the subject, and in December 1880 they issued a circular stating in effect that they considered that the scale prescribed by the Superannuation (Metropolis) Act, 1866, should generally be followed, where pensions were awarded under the Act of 1864. The scale (one-sixtieth of salary, &amp;c, for each completed year of service) is based on that which was at that time allowed in the Civil Service.14. In most cases boards of guardians appear to have exercised their discretion under the Acts of 1864 and 1870 in such a way as to give the poor-law officers to whom those Acts applied a reasonable expectation of superannuation; but in some cases the guardians acted capriciously, and a relatively small number of boards, refused to grant any superannuation. These facts, coupled with the anomalous position in regard to part-time officers which had been created by the Act of 1870, gave rise to considerable discussion. Various schemes (including a scheme, soon dropped, for a central fund) were produced by Associations of Poor Law Officers for remedying the defects of which they complained, and in 1896 a Bill was introduced by a private member, which became law under the title of &quot; The Poor Law Officers&apos; Superannuation Act, 1896.&quot; Under this Act officers of boards of guardians have a legal right to superannuation allowances on a scale laid down in the, Act, subject to contributions being made by them at rates ranging from 2 to 3 per cent, of salary or wages and emoluments. These contributions are not funded, but are carried in aid of current rates, and the superannuation allowances are paid out of current rates. The allowances1 are based on the average salary, &amp;c, of the last five years of service.
15. In the following year (1897), consequent upon representations in which it was alleged that most of the contributions payable under the Act of 1896 by female nurses would in practice be applied towards the superannuation of officers whose service was of a more permanent character, a Bill was brought in by a private member to enable those nurses to contract out of the Act of 1896.  This Bill passed unopposed through both Houses.- Asylums officers.16. The Lunatic Asylums Act, 1853 (s. 57), the Lunacy Acts Amendment Act, 1862 (s. 12), and the Lunacy Act, 1890 (ss. 280-282), provided for the granting, at the discretion of the local employing bodies, of superannuation allowances to officers in asylums. These allowances were chargeable on the local rates, without contributions by the officers concerned. The employees in asylums, encouraged, doubtless, by the benefits obtained by the police in 1890 and the poor-law officers in 1896, claimed to be given a legal right to pensions, and this, with a right of appeal to the Secretary of State, was granted to them by the Asylums Officers&apos; Superannuation Act, 1909. This Act was modelled (except as regards benefits) on the Poor Law Officers&apos; Superannuation Act, 1896 (see Parl. paper 257 of 1909, p. 2), and, like that Act, provides that contributions of 2, 2j, and 3 per cent, of their salaries, .&amp;c, shall be made by the employees towards the cost of superannuation, that these contributions shall be treated by the employing authorities as current income, and that the superannuation allowances shall be met out of current income. The allowances are based on the average salary, &amp;c, of the last ten years of service.Officers in Certified Institutions for Defectives.17. Officers in certified institutions provided by local authorities for defectives were given a legal right to superannuation allowances by the Asylums and Certified Institutions (Officers Pensions) Act, 1918. The Act makes provision for contributions from the officers of 2h per cent, of their salaries or wages, for these contributions being treated as current income, and for the superannuation allowances being met out of current income.Local Schemes.(i) The Superannuation (Metropolis) Act, 1866.18. The legislation empowering particular local authorities to superannuate all or any of their officers was at first based on the then existing Acts, already mentioned, for the superannuation of particular classes of officers. Thus, the private member who introduced the Bill for the Superannuation (Metropolis) Act, 1866, stated that it was based on the Poor Law Officers&apos; Superannuation Act, 1864. Consequently the Act of 1866 merely empowers but does not compel the local authorities within the Metropolis to whom it applies to superannuate their officers, requires no contributions from the officers, and makes the superannuation allowances payable out of current rates. The allowances are based on the salary attained at the date of retirement.(ii) Schemes under local Acts.19. While the Act of 1866 empowers all the public health authorities in London to superannuate their officers, similar authorities in England and Wales outside London-have no corresponding powers under the general law, and consequently the only extra-metropolitan public health authorities who possess such powers are the few who have obtained them by means of local Acts. Instances in which Parliament has given powers, similar to those conferred on metropolitan authorities by the Act of 1.866, to individual extra-metropolitan public health authorities are found in the Wallasey Improvement Act, 1864 (s. 38), the West Ham Local Board Act, 1867 (s. 34), the St. Helens Improvement Act, 1869 (s. 428), the Liverpool Improvement Act, 1882 (ss. 59 and 60), and the Southport Corporation Act, 1900 (ss. 156-7).20. The suitability of the provisions of the Act of 1866, and of the similar provisions in local Acts, to meet the needs of the authorities and officers to which they applied was mean-time being questioned from two quarters: the officers concerned raised the objection that their reasonable expectation of superannuation under those provisions was at the mercy of bodies without assured continuity of policy, while, on the other hand, the principle of imposing upon a future generation of ratepayers superannuation charges incurred in respect of services rendered to the present generation was adversely criticised. These objections led to attempts being made to establish, on a financially sound basis, local superannuation funds to which the local authorities and their officers should contribute, and in which the officers should have a vested interest.   Two classes of funds resulted from these attempts, viz.:(i) Thrift funds on an individual basis,(ii) Superannuation funds on a mutual basis. % .
Thrift funds.21. The provisions in local Acts which enable local authorities to set up &quot;thrift fund&quot; schemes empower the authority to make a scheme &quot;for the encouragement of thrift and with a view of providing a sum of money which in the event of retirement or death of any person in the service of the Corporation who has contributed to the fund shall be available for himself or his representatives.&quot; The fund is formed of contributions made jointly by the employees and by the local authority, and the intention is that the benefits acquired by each officer shall he represented by his own contributions and the contributions of the local authority in respect of him and interest thereon. Provisions on these lines were first passed in the Manchester Corporation Act, 1891. The Ixmdon County Council. (General Powers) Act, 1891 (since amended), the Croydon and St. Helens Corporation Acts, 1898, the Cardiff Corporation Act, 1894, and several subsequent Acts, contain provisions of the same kind. Some of the funds so authorised have in fact not been established, for the reason, we understand, that the super-annuation allowances which could be provided would be altogether inadequate. The Manchester Corporation established a fund ,under their Act of 1891, and the Committee have heard evidence showing that the benefits derivable from the fund are so small that the Corporation do not enforce retirement at 65 years of age but retain in their service a large number of aged officers.Superannuation funds.22. In the schemes setting up superannuation funds the officers of the local authority are given the statutory right to a superannuation allowance bearing a specified ratio to their salaries, subject to their contributing to the superannuation fund set up under the local Act. Schemes of this kind were provided for in the Liverpool Improvement Act/1882, the Southport Corporation Act, 1900, and the Newcastle-upon-Tyne Corporation Act, 1904. The Committee have heard evidence as to the last-mentioned scheme. It provided for pensions, on the basis of l/60th of the average amount of salary received during the last five years of service for each year of service, for officers contributing to the superannuation fund. The scale of contributions to the superannuation fund by the officers which was laid down in the Act varied from 2 to 4 per cent, of the salary, and the Corporation Avere required to contribute to the fund in each year a sum equal to that contributed by the officers. The Act contained a provision for the making good out of the city fund of any deficiency in the superannuation fund, subject to the condition that after the expiration of 10 years from the passing of the Act the total amount contributed by the Corporation to the fund in any year should not exceed 4 per cent, of the salaries of the contributing officers. The provisions of the Friendly Societies Act, 1896, were made applicable, and on the actuarial iin^estigation required by that Act being-made at the expiration of 5 years after the fund was established a large deficiency in the fund was reported. The Corporation consequently obtained amended provisions by a local Act of 1911, but the scheme set up under those provisions is, according to evidence given to the Committee, now greatly in need of amendment.23. The London County Council have established funds for the superannuation of their officers under the provisions of- local Acts. The Metropolitan Water Board have established a superannuation fund under provisions in a local Act of 1907. The Corporation of London have also set up such funds the latest under the City of London (Various Powers) Act, 1912, and during the period from 1905 to the outbreak of the war twelve of the twenty-eight metropolitan borough councils obtained local Acts containing provisions for the establish-, ment of superannuation funds.The first of the metropolitan borough councils to obtain such powers was the Stepney Borough Council, whose Act, passed in 1905, provided for the establishment of a super-annuation fund to be constituted by (i) a payment of 1007. a year by the borough council; (ii) contributions by the officers; (iii) interest thereon, and (iv) &quot; such amount out of the general rate as may be required to meet any deficiency on the superannuation fund as in this Act provided.&quot; A similar Act was obtained in 1906 by the Bethnal Green Borough Council. The superannuation funds set up by these two Acts are more or less illusory; for the 1007. a year paid by the borough council, the contributions by the officers, and the interest thereon, are not actuarially sufficient to secure the benefits to the officers for which the Acts provide, and there must ultimately be a large deficiency to be made good annually out of the general rate.In a similar Bill promoted by the Kensington Borough Council in 1907 a Committee of the House of Commons inserted a provision requiring a periodical actuarial investigation of the superannuation fund. The Actuary is to report as .to the solvency of the fund, and to certify the annual sum required to be paid into the fund in addition to the contributions of the officers and other receipts specifically provided for, so that the fund shall be solvent without further recourse to the general rate. This provision was also inserted in local Acts obtained in 1908 and 1909 by the St. Marylebone, Camberwell, Deptford, Hackney, Wandsworth, and West-minster Borough Councils. Questions arose, however, as to its construction ; and the Local Government Board, after consulting the Institute of Actuaries, called the special attention o out a
of Parliament to the matter in their reports on Bills promoted in session 1911 by the Padding- * ton and Poplar Borough Councils, with the result that the provision was altered in these cases so as to make it clear that the Actuary in giving his certificate should have regard to the permanent solvency of the fund, and not only to its solvency during the next ensuing period. This decision has been followed in. subsequent local Acts which have provided for the establishment of superannuation funds.24. The establishment of superannuation funds has given rise to differences-of opinion and practice with regard to the manner in which superannuation allowances in respect of the back service of existing officers (i.e., service rendered by them prior to the commencement of a fund or scheme) should, if given, be charged. In some cases the superannuation charge in respect of such service is not charged on the fund but on current revenues; in others it is charged on the fund and the liability of the fund in respect of such service is ascertained by actuarial calculation and then defrayed by contributions spread either over an indefinite period (as in some of the Metropolitan Borough schemes) or over a fixed period, e.g., 60 years in the case of the Liverpool Corporation and 50 years in the case of the London County Council.National schemes for pensions or allowances.25. Some benefits, similar to those obtainable under a superannuation scheme, may in appropriate cases be obtained under the Workmens Compensation Act, 1906, the Old Age Pensions Act, 1908, and the National Insurance Act, 19.1.1, and the amending Acts, as well by servants of local authorities as by other persons. In some cases persons entitled to the benefits of a superannuation scheme, have, with their employers, been excepted in wThole or in part from the obligation to contribute to the scheme under the National Insurance Act.General effect of past legislation.26. In the hope of benefiting from the experience of our predecessors, we have now traced, -at some length, the legislation of the past ninety years relating to the superannuation of persons employed by local authorities.   In the aggregate it is incomplete, overlapping, and conflicting.It is incomplete because it is partial. Under it some persons employed by local authorities are, as we have shown, able confidently to count upon superannuation when occasion arises; some may reasonably hope to obtain superannuation ; while others, no less worthy, are debarred from all hope of superannuation because Parliament has not empowered their employers to grant it to them. Under the public general statutes at present in force the town clerk of a borough in London may be superannuated but not the town clerk of a borough outside London ; the medical officer of a poor-law infirmary is entitled to superannuation while the medical officer of health of an extra-metropolitan county cannot be given a superannuation allowance by his council; the accountant to the visiting committee of a lunatic asylum is entitled to superannuation but not the accountant to a hospital board ; a rate collector appointed by a board of guardians is entitled to superannuation but not a rate collector appointed by an urban district council. A librarian may be superannuated in Poplar but not in East Ham; a sanitary inspector may be superannuated in Stepney but not in Southend; nurses in the hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board for infectious disease may be superannuated but not those in the corresponding hospitals in Leeds. This situation, which appears to us indefensible, will become worse, if, as is contemplated, the staffs of boards of guardians, already entitled to superannuation, are added to the staffs of county and county borough councils whom those councils have no power to superannuate.There are also in this legislation cases in which the provisions of local Acts overlap, the provisions of public general Acts, e.g., in the case of the local Act schemes in London and the provisions of the Superannuation (Metropolis) Act, 1866.The legislation on the subject is also conflicting, in the sense that it is based on no common principles. Under it contributions are levied in some cases and not in others: there are schemes without &quot;funds,&quot; and schemes with &quot;funds&quot;; funds on a basis actuarially sound have been required in some cases while in other cases funds which are not on such a basis have been allowed. A careful study of the general and local schemes now in operation shows that in different localities different rates of contribution are charged for the same benefits, and different benefits are given for the same rates of contribution. Some schemes provide for officers and workmen, without differentiation; others provide separate funds for workmen, with rates of contribution and scales of benefits differing from those for officers. In some, &apos; provision is made for aggregating, for purposes of superannuation, service rendered in succession to two or moredocal authorities ; others provide only for superannuation in-respect of service rendered to the local authority with whom the final period of service is spent; and, in cases where provision for aggregation of service is made, the provision.is more liberal in some than in others, Some schemes do, while others do not, provide for the return of the whole or part of the officers contributions in the event of early death or voluntary retirement.
Some, but not all, provide that in exceptional cases years may be added to those actually served in order to provide superannuation of adequate amount. Some schemes, but not all, provide for their compulsory application to now entrants into the service, Some, but not all, provide for compulsory retirement at 65.Practically, the situation we have to face is chaotic.Section III.-Desirability of a scheme of superannuation.27. After this survey of the existing state of affairs we may turn to the task committed to us. We do not hesitate about the answer to the first part of our reference. It is undoubtedly desirable that a scheme of superannuation should be introduced applicable to persons employed by local authorities in England and Wales, and the fact that there is no such scheme in general application at present points rather to the difficulties of framing one than to any doubt of its desirability. The advantages of superannuation are too well known and too widely recognised to require much argument. Not only public authorities but also many banks, insurance offices, and other private undertakings have put into force schemes of superannuation. Such measures tend to secure a good class of entrants to the services to which they apply ; and it is especially necessary that the local authorities of the country should be able to attract and retain the services of capable men, particularly having regard to the increasing importance and range of the duties devolving upon them. In other ways an acceptable system of superannuation tends to safeguard efficiency: by this means the persons employed are relieved of anxieties for their future when advancing years or failing health may deprive them of the power to work: the employer on the other hand secures a more contented staff, unburdened by the presence of aged or infirm members retained out of compassion, who, although they can no longer discharge adequately the duties of their office, remain to block the promotion of younger men and to lower the. quality of the whole service.28. This is no imaginary picture. Witnesses have cited to us numerous instances in which local authorities, out of regard for long and faithful service, have continued to employ persons who are unfit, by reason of old age or infirmity, to carry on their duties efficiently. Some continue to do their work, though not as it should be done. Some virtually do no work at all, though retaining their titular posts and drawing their salaries. Others have been appointed to consultative posts at a reduced salary, not always with advantage to the service, by which round-about means some of the difficulties have been obviated which a superannuation scheme would have removed. It would, without doubt, be of great advantage to the whole of the staffs concerned, as well as to the authorities they serve, that a system of superannua-tion should be introduced. And when to these considerations is added the fact that many persons similarly serving local authorities are already, under the schemes referred to earlier in this Report, receiving the benefit of superannuation, and that teachers, also the servants of local authorities, have recently received the advantage of the School Teachers (Superannuation) Act, 1918, it can cause no surprise that both authorities and officers have with one voice asked that the principle should be extended to cover the whole country.Section IV.-General principles.29. This conclusion brings us face to face with the difficulties of our task. The problems presented by the latter part of our reference are, as will appear in the course of our Report, many and complicated. We may begin by trying to establish some general principles upon which to base our recommendations.Uniformity.      ,30. In the first place it is desirable that there should be uniform arrangements throughout England and Wales. A chaos of independent and conflicting schemes needs no condemnation. One of our chief objects is to bring order out of confusion.Compulsion (i) for authorities and (ii) for officers.31. But it is not easy to determine whether an obligation to pension their officers should be laid on all authorities which are now without superannuation schemes (disregarding at this stage of our Report the case of authorities which have existing schemes of their own) or whether optional powers only should be conferred upon them. The argument for compulsion is plain : it is the only certain means whereby the desired end can be immediately.attained. Although the representatives of the local authorities who appeared before us were all in favour of the principle of. superannuation, it is not impossible that many especially of the smaller-local authorities would shrink, for fear of a rise in the rates, from putting it into practice if the choice were left to them.; so that the evils of the present state of affairs, though abated, would not be removed. The early history of the superannuation of poor-law officers gives some ground for fearing that an enabling Act might be largely ineffective. Moreover, if each local authority were merely empowered at any time to take advantage of an Act providing for the superannuation of their officers, these
officers might he left indefinitely in a position of uncertainty as to Avhether they would or would not be superannuated at the end of their service, a position which led to such difficulties in the case of the police, the poor-law officers, and the asylums officers, that (as already stated) legislation making compulsory provision for their superannuation was passed. On the other hand, we are well aware of tho objections to applying compulsion to local authorities in such a sphere. It may well be urged that the conditions under which they may engage their staff.for local duties should remain under their control, and that the principle and value of local self government is impaired by successive encroachments upon their liberty of action.32. Happily, we are helped by the local authorities themselves to escape from this dilemma. We have considered at length the evidence tendered to us by the County Councils&apos; Association, the Association of Municipal Corporations, the Urban District Councils&apos; Association, the Rural District Councils&apos; Association, and the Poor Law Unions&apos; Association, who all dealt with this point. The four last-named associations are in favour of compulsion, and the County Councils&apos; Association do not go further in the other direction than to say that &quot; it might be inadvisable to impose compulsion in the first instance.&quot; It is plain that great regard is due to these opinions. Indeed, the higher the value placed on the autonomy of local authorities, the greater the respect which must be paid to their wishes when in the exercise of their discretion they ask for legislation which would limit that autonomy. We have therefore come to the conclusion that the scheme which we recommend should be obligatory on all the authorities concerned.33. The next question is, whether the scheme should also be made obligatory on all the appropriate officers of those authorities. We have no hesitation in recommending the appli-cation of the principle of compulsion to all future entrants into the service. But the&quot; case of existing officers is not so clear. All the precedents, whether under general or local Acts establishing pension schemes, are in favour of granting an option to existing officers to join schemes, such option to be exercised within a strictly limited period. The scheme prepared by the National Association of Local Government Officers contained a provision that any existing officer could within six months from the time of the scheme becoming operative signify in writing to the employing authority that he did not wish to avail himself of the provisions of the scheme. -The main arguments in favour of granting an option to existing officers appear to be (i) That compulsion would constitute a breach of the contract of service which wouldbe manifestly undesirable if it could be avoided.(ii) That substantially the same result could be obtained by giving an option, since, ifthe scheme is a good one, all but a small minority of existing officers will be anxious to take advantage of it.(iii) That the scheme may result in hardship in those cases where officers have already made adequate provision for their old age or breakdown.On the other hand it is argued that the application of compulsion to local authorities and not to their officers is inconsistent; that the statutory imposition of a one-sided option operating in favour of the officer and against the authority is hard to justify; and that if the contract of service is to be maintained intact the local authority cannot be required, as we recommend, to vary it by the grant of superannuation rights to existing officers. And further, that the offer of an option would postpone for many years the full realisation of the advantages of super-annuation so that local authorities would probably find themselves still burdened with a certain number of older officers ineligible for a pension and retained therefore out of compassion with all the consequent disadvantages to the service. After giving due weight to these various considerations we have reached the conclusion, though not unanimously, that the scheme should be compulsory upon all existing officers, provided that if an existing officer is able to satisfy the employing authority that he has made and is continuing to make adequate provision by means of insurance or otherwise for old age and invalidity he should be entitled to be exempted from the scheme.By whom should the cost be borne ?34. It has been strongly represented by some who have come before us that the whole of the money for the superannuation of the officers of local authorities should be found by the National Exchequer, and they point to the School Teachers (Superannuation) Act, 1918, as the model which should be followed. It is, perhaps, not unreasonable to assume that if the Government had been willing to adopt this simple solution we should have been spared the labours of this inquiry. But, however that may be, we have considered it on its merits. It is not unlikely that, but for the Teachers&apos; Act, no such claim would have been put forward. Indeed, its principal advocates are to be found in the National Association of Local Govern-ment Officers, a body representing a large number of officers of local authorities, which for years consistently urged the establishment of a contributoiy scheme to be financed by the authorities and their officers, and has only put forward a claim for State superannuation since the appearance of the teachers&apos; scheme,
35. The main argument in support of this position is that the work of officials in the service of local authorities is of equal national importance to that of teachers, who are also the officers of local authorities, and demands equal treatment. Whatever view may be taken of the validity of this argument, it ignores altogether the history of teachers&apos; pensions and the special reasons for which the teachers&apos; scheme of 1918 was instituted. By the Elementary School Teachers (Superannuation) Act, 1898, the State committed itself to the policy of government pensions for all certificated elementary school teachers, and the Act of 1918 is but a development of that policy rendered necessary by circumstances which were explained at the time by the President of the Board of Education. Speaking in the House of Commons in support of the Bill for the Act of 1918 he said : &quot;It is notorious that it has become increasingly difficult to find recruits for teaching Avork in our elementary schools, and if the Education Act which has recently been placed upon the Statute Book is to be effectively worked, it is clear that something should be done, and done promptly, to render the position of the teacher in an elementary school in this country more attractive than it has hitherto been,&quot; (Parl. Debates, 21st October 1918, Vol. 110, No. 101, Col, 466.)And again: &quot; The broad principle of the Bill is that it is an attempt to make the condition of the teaching profession attractive, and to bring into the profession more teachers in the future.&quot;   (Parl. Debates, 29th October 1918, Vol. 110, No. 106, Col. 1385.)These considerations are in no way applicable to the general service of local authorities. Moreover, the teachers are dealt with as a profession, not as local, government officers, and, indeed, irrespective of the fact that the majority of them are in the service of local authorities. And there, are other material respects in which the teaching service differs from the rest of the local government services. The conditions of entry into and;of work during service, the technical qualifications demanded, and the amount of control exercised by the appropriate Government Department, separate the case of teachers from that of the general staff of local bodies. To agree to the claim for &quot; equality of treatment&quot; would be to admit that special emergencies and special conditions can never be met by special treatment.36. But to deny the claim for state superannuation is not to dispose of the demand made by witnesses on behalf of the local authorities for a substantial government grant in aid of the cost of superannuation. The witness who gave evidence before us on behalf of the Urban District. Councils&apos; Association suggested that as much as one-third of that cost should be borne by the State. This demand is based upon the view that more and more of the services administered by local authorities are. becoming national in character, and, indeed, in its extreme and simplest form, upon the assertion that there are now no services remaining which are purely local.37. It does not come within the terms of our reference to enter into this controversy. It was exhaustively explored in 1901 by the Royal Commission on Local Taxation and more recently by the Departmental Committee on Local Taxation which reported in 1914. We are content to take it from their Reports that there are two classes of services administered by local authorities, one class which is &quot;preponderantly national&quot; or &quot;semi-national&quot; in character, and the other class which is local in character. The division is not watertight, and a service placed in one class at one time may in process of development be transferred to the other.  But the two classes exist and so far as we can tell will continue to exist.38. The nature of semi-national services claims financial aid. from national sources, and this claim was fully admitted by the Government when it embodied in the Finance Bill, 1914, proposals for making grants in respect of all the services then classed as semi-national. Such grants are properly accompanied by central control, for the Government is entitled to see that semi-national services are efficiently administered and that value is obtained for the expenditure of national funds. The control exercised by the Board of Education is a familiar example of this principle in operation.39. We consider that whenever a service is state-aided the cost of superannuation should in future be included in the expenditure on which the grant is based. In such cases the State and the local authority are in effect joint employers and should accordingly share both cost and control. Where the grant is based on a definite proportion of salaries or of total cost the State will automatically bear the same proportion of the cost of superannuation as of the rest of the expenses which are brought into account. Where the grant is fixed or dependent on some other formula we think it should be revised so as to take superannuation into account. It would no doubt be difficult, if not impracticable, to carry out this proposal in its entirety if the present system of assigned revenues were to be maintained. But the recommendation of the Departmental Committee on Local Taxation, to which effect was sought, to be given in the Finance Bill, 1914, was that this system should be abolished and that government subventions should in future be paid direct from the Exchequer to the administering local authorities.By this means we go some way towards meeting the demand (referred to in paragraph 36) for a specific grant in aid of superannuation; but we can see no good reason for askingb 3
lor a government grant in respect of any part of the cost of local services which are not semi-national in character. In our opinion such a grant cannot he justified by the nature of the service performed and would involve undesirable and unwelcome government control. Local services should be locally administered and locally financed.40. If, then, the burden is to be borne locally (apart from the national contribution to semi-national services, which will, go in part payment of the employing authority&apos;s expenses), it remains to consider by whom it should be borne, whether entirely by the authorities (i.e., a non-contributory scheme) or partly by the authorities and partly by their officers (i.e., a contri-butory scheme), and, if the latter, in what proportions.41. We have found a great preponderance of opinion in favour of a contributory scheme. The local authorities&apos; representatives who appeared as witnesses were unanimous in this sense, and many of the officers take the same view. Indeed, had it not been for the influence of the teachers&apos; scheme, we doubt whether the non-contributory system, would have been advocated before us. The assumption underlying the arguments used both by its advocates and by its opponents is that a non-contributory scheme is more favourable to the employed and lees favourable to the employer; but it is by no means certain that in the long run this &apos;s so. It is perhaps impossible to determine the real incidence of contributions, but there are some persons of great experience who maintain that the result of a superannuation scheme is ultimately to reduce salaries by an amount at least equal to the employers&apos; contributions. If this be true, the ultimate financial effects of the two systems are much the same. But whether this be the truth or not, in any event the immediate financial effects of the two systems are different, for the employers&apos; contribution is undoubtedly a free gift to all existing officers. And the moral effects produced are also different, for the burden of a contributory system at any rate appears to be shared. The local authorities and the ratepayers will naturally look at the early and the obvious resujts, and so will the beneficiaries; and all parties will, we believe, regard it as equitable that the burden, like the advantages, should be shared. It is probably due to some such considerations as these that all local schemes approved by Parliament in recent years for authorities in England and Wales, as well as the general schemes applicable to the poor-law, the police, and the asylums services, are based upon the contributory principle. We are satisfied that it would be unwise to depart from this principle, and we recommend that it should be followed. It should be observed that under a contributory system the officer may be freer to change his service ; for it can be provided that he may withdraw the total of his contributions if he leaves the service, whereas if the system were non-contributory he would lose the whole of his vested interest.Benefits.42. Before discussing the proportions in which the required contribution should be shared it will be convenient to consider the benefits to be provided, and whether or not a fund should be set up, since both these questions vitally affect the total of the contribution required.The benefits we contemplate are as follows : (i) A pension of l/60th of the average salary or wages and emoluments of the last fiveyears for each completed year of contributing service, up to a maximum of 40/60ths, payable on retirement after not less than ten years of contributing service (a) by reason of permanent mental or physical disability or (b) at 65 years of age: pro-vided that an officer who has contributed for 40 years and has reached the age of 60 shall be entitled to a pension on retirement at any time.No officer shall be admitted as a contributor under the age of 18 or over the age of 55.Retirement at 65 shall be obligatory, unless the authority by special resolution, which may be renewed as often as the authority shall see fit, decide, with the- officers consent, to retain him in the service for a specified period not exceeding one year.(ii) Retirement at 60 after 40 years of contributing service shall be at the option either of the officer or of the authority.(iii) An officer shall be entitled to receive the amount of his contributions, with compoundinterest at the rate of three per cent., who, not being entitled to superannuation,(a) loses his office or employment by reason of a reduction of staff, the abolition of his office, or the termination of a joint appointment;(6) ceases to hold his office or employment by reason of ill-health or bodily injury; or(c) is required to retire on marriage.(iv) An officer shall be entitled to receive the amount of his contributions, withoutinterest, who retires&apos;voluntarily or is dismissed: provided that the contributions of any officer wTho has been dismissed for fraud or misconduct, involving pecuniary loss to the employing authority, shall be forfeited to that authority, and may be ,     dealt with by them at their discretion,
(v) The legal personal representative of an officer who dies(a) before he has become entitled to. superannuation shall be entitled to -   the total amount of his contributions with compound interest at the rate of threepercent.;(b) after he has become entitled to superannuation and has not received in the aggregate by way of superannuation an amount equal to his contributions with compound interest at the rate of three per cent, calculated up to the date of retirement, shall be entitled to the balance between the amount received by way of superannuation and the total amount of the contributions so calculated.These benefits are of a kind made familiar by contributory schemes now in operation and do not therefore require much comment. It has seemed to us wiser to follow the general lines which experience has indicated, while trying to avoid the minor defects which it has revealed, than to strike out into any new path. We are advised that the benefits we recommend are in total slightly more valuable actuarially than those provided under the School Teachers (Superannuation) Act, 1918, but the difference is inconsiderable.43. It will be observed that we have recommended that pensions shall be based, on a scale of l/60th of salary and that, in certain eventualities, the sums contributed by officers them-selves shall be returned to them or paid to their representatives. One alternative would have been to base pensions on a scale of l/80th, with provision for the payment of a lump sum, related to salary, at retirement or death, as.in the present Civil Service Scheme and in the scheme of ths School Teachers (Superannuation)-Act, 1918. We do not under-rate the value of the lump sum on retirement or of the benefit at death provided for in these schemes ; but in so far as they exceed either in scope or amount the provision for death during active service (or shortly after retirement) recommended by us in paragraph 42, we think that the practical advantage is outweighed by the reduction of pensions from the basis of l/60th to that of l/8()th which they entail, and in this opinion we are supported, on the whole, by the witnesses who appeared before us.Whether the benefits should be the same for women as for men.44. We have considered whether special benefits should be provided for women contri-distributors, and we have consulted a number of women possessing experience of the female staffs of local authorities. The answers we have received to our inquiries do not go to show that special benefits are required. Opinion is, as was to be expected, divided, but the balance of opinion is against differentiation on the ground of sex. An earlier age of retirement for women would, moreover, need special justification in face of their greater average longevity. Thus the balance of informed opinion, the advantage of simplicity in the construction of the scheme, and the present-day demand for equality of conditions for the two sexes, all point in the same direction and convince us that no differentiation should be made.There is one benefit in the scheme we propose which, as a matter of fact, affects women exclusively, and that is the provision for the return of contributions with interest in the event of compulsory retirement on marriage ; but the only reason why that does not affect men also is that they are never required to resign their posts on marriage. The differentiation is thus in the conditions of employment, and not in the provisions of the superannuation scheme.Added years.45. In connection with the question of benefits our attention has been called to section 5 of the Superannuation (Metropolis) Act, 1866, and similar provisions contained in some local Acts, whereby the authorities concerned are empowered, in computing the superannuation allowances of certain officers, to add a number of years, not exceeding ten, to the years of actual service. A power to add years, subject to the consent of a Central Department being obtained, is given by the Poor Law Officers&apos; Superannuation Act, 1896, and the Asylums Officers&apos; Superannuation Act, 1909 ; and the scheme for the Bill prepared by the National Association of Local Government Officers proposed to confer a similar limited power upon all local authorities, subject to the proviso that any expenditure incurred by the exercise of the power should be a direct charge on the rates.Provisions enabling years to be added to those actually served were contained in the Civil Service Superannuation Acts of 1859 and 1884, but were repealed, so far as new entrants to the service are concerned, by the Superannuation Act, 1914. &apos; The School Teachers (Super-annuation) Act, 1918, gives no power to add years, and the Asylums and Certified Institutions (Officers Pensions) Act, 1918, expressly provides that the power to add years shall not apply in respect of a certain type of service.We have considered whether we should recommend that a power to add years should be included in our scheme. Clearly, as is recognised by the above-mentioned proviso to the National Associations scheme, funds constituted on an actuarial bjisis cannot provide for suchb i
unforeseen grants as might be made if the power were given: grants of that kind must be a direct charge upon the rates of the local authority concerned. But we are not convinced that power to make such grants is called for. Wo understand the argument in favour of giving such a power to be that many officers with professional or other special qualifications necessarily enter the service of local authorities&apos; at a comparatively late age, and, in the absence of a power to add years to those actually served, cannot obtain a full two-thirds or indeed an adequate pension. But we see no reason, why they should receive the maximum pension or be superannuated on a higher scale than their colleagues ; their salaries on entry are necessarily higher than those of entrants who lack their training and experience, and they are thus able to make further provision for old age or invalidity if they think fit. The exercise of such a discretionary power must be attended by difficulties, and we see no sufficient cause for departing from the principle, affirmed by the above-mentioned Acts of 1914 and 1918, of basing pension strictly upon the number of years of service.Definition of pensionable salary or wages,46. In the great majority of cases the officers of the local authorities receive the whole of their remuneration in the form of a salary or wage of easily ascertainable amount. Officers attached to institutions usually, however, receive their remuneration partly in the form of a cash payment and partly in the form of board and lodging. Again, some officers (e.g., solicitor-clerks to local authorities) are entitled to receive, in addition to salary, fees on a professional scale for professional services rendered to the authority. And sometimes an officer is paid a lump sum to cover his own remuneration and certain other items (e.g., his travelling expenses, the cost of clerical assistance, the rent of offices). In these circumstances, it is necessary to determine-the amount of remuneration in respect of which contributions will be payable and superannuation allowances receivable.   -We are of opinion that salary or wages should be taken to be the net sum received by an officer for his personal use, exclusive of (i) any portion paid away to assistants engaged by the recipient, and (ii) travelling and other expenses of his office. We think that the value of all permanent emoluments, which may be defined as any benefits enjoyed in kind attaching to an appointment, should be added to the salary and wages and be definitely fixed by the employing authority, on the basis of their value to the holder, and be revised in the event of any substantial alterations in economic conditions. Occasional emoluments (for example, overtime payments, casual allowances, single meals) should be ignored. In this connection the question of war bonus or war wage must be considered. Such part of this pay as appears likely to be permanent should, we think, be the subject of contribution and pension. Emoluments represented by fees paid to a professional officer on a recognised professional scale should be excluded.Whether contributions should be funded.47. We have now to determine whether the contributions of both parties should be funded, or whether the officers&apos; contributions should be taken in relief of current rates or revenues, which would then be charged with the payment of the liabilities as they fall due. The latter principle is followed in the case of poor-law officers and asylums officers, and in the scheme of the Birmingham Corporation ; the former in all other local contributory schemes. The example of non-contributory schemes is hardly relevant.48. The main argument in favour of treating officers&apos; contributions as part of the income of the year and pension payments as current charges upon such income is the resulting simplicity of administration, all elaborate bookkeeping together with the business of management and investment of a fund being obviated. There is thus less staff and less expense necessitated, and this simplicity and economy, it may be argued, outweigh the theoretical and practical advantages of a fund, especially when, as in the case of the poor-law authorities, a large number of separate small funds would be required. It is also sometimes claimed that, as the retirement of the older officers is an advantage to the service, the burden of the pension should be borne in the years when this advantage is realised.49. Against this, it is contended that, whether or not a pension be regarded as deferred pay, the contingent liability to pay it is incurred when the individual is taken into the service and accrues year by year during his official life, and that it is a sound financial rule that provision should be made each year to meet the liabilities incurred in the year, no matter when they may mature ; in other words, that when a liability is created an asset should also be created to extinguish it. This rule is not to be lightly disregarded in the finance of local authorities, which are necessarily exposed to fluctuations of policy, and where it is therefore specially important that those iii power to-day should not be able to place upon a later generation of ratepayers the whole weight of a liability which they themselves have incurred. It may, no doubt, be argued that the effect of the funding principle is to withdraw money from the ratepayers before it is actually needed, instead of allowing it to fructify in their pockets. The resulting gain is, however, seen in the smaller percentage of salaries which is required to be paid year by year into an. accumulative fund in order to provide a
given benefit on retirement when compared with the percentage of the same salaries required to provide that benefit on maturity out of current revenues. Thus, for entrants at the age of 20, the superannuation benefits which can be provided by an annual payment into an accumulative fund of 10 per cent, of the total salaries (allowing for returns of contributions at death, &amp;c.) will ultimately represent (without any such returns) a payment of 25 per cent, of the same total salaries if the benefits are to be paid out of annual income as they fall due. It follows, therefore, that the abandonment of the funding principle not only relieves the present ratepayers of any part of the cost of a liability which they incur, but throws upon future ratepayers a much heavier burden than that which is now avoided. Nor is this all, for in the earlier years of contributory non-funding schemes (for example, the Asylums Officers&apos; scheme) the present ratepayers may actually find their rates relieved, inasmuch as excesses of officers&apos; contributions over outgoings go in relief of current rates. A further argument in support of the funding of contributions may be found in &quot;the fact that some officers consider the existence of such a fund gives them greater security for their pensions.50. These arguments seem to the majority of us conclusive. The additional complexity of the administration is in our opinion amply justified by the advantage gained,&apos; and proposals which we make later in this Report will reduce to a minimum the accounting and actuarial work involved and will obviate the necessity of establishing a large number of small funds.Proportions in which contributions should be shared between authorities and officers.51. We may now return to the question of contributions and consider the proportions in which, they ought to be shared between the employing authorities on the one hand and their officers on the other. In most of the existing schemes the employees&apos; contributions range from 2 per cent, to 0 per cent, of their salaries or wages, according to age or length of service at the date when the first contribution is made, though in some cases higher percentages are paid.52. We have taken some pains to ascertain the basis upon which these contributions were originally settled. The.first of all the contributory systems affecting the officers of local authorities was, as has been shown in paragraph 12, that which was established by the Metropolitan Police Act of 1839. It appears from the debates on the Bill for that Act that, the expectation of the Government was that a deduction of 2h per cent, from pay, together with the other income derived from fees, fines, &amp;c, would suffice to meet the pension charges, without requiring any contributions from public funds. But the conditions of service of the police are so special, and the circumstances of 80 years ago differ so widely from those of to-day, that the importance of this piece of history depends less on the value of the precedent it offers than on the light which it throws on the origin of a 2k per cent, contri-bution in schemes affecting local authorities.53. When we come to the history of the present poor-law scheme we are on firmer &apos; ground.   For we are dealing with recent events and with a staff closely comparable to that employed by local authorities generally.   The Memorandum prefixed to the Bill for the Poor Law Officers&apos; Superannuation Act, 1896, stated that the percentages mentioned therein (2, 2i, and 3) had-&quot;been arrived at from the experience of other superannuation schemes and will practically be found sufficient to meet future claims for superannuation&quot; ;and both the mover and the seconder of the motion for the second reading in the House of Commons took the same line.   The mover stated that * &quot;under this Bill, an average deduction from the salaries of 2\ per cent, would amount to 50,0001. per annum. This would be voluntarily given up by the officers, to entitle them absolutely to the benefits created by this measure. There would be no increase to the rates, and the Boards of Guardians could dispense with the services of old and worn-out officers without inflicting hardship.&quot;And the seconder said that &quot; it had been found that the deduction of a percentage of 2 or 3 per cent, from the salaries of the officials would, in all probability, cover every outlay as regarded superan-nuation, whereby the rates would be relieved of any extra tax thrown upon them in future.&quot;These sanguine estimates do not appear to have been challenged, although one member for a Scottish constituency &quot; observed that the promoters of the. Bill assumed that the scheme was going to pay for itself. In regard to Scotland, however, hon. members would not be satisfied with an assumption of that kind, and would require proof that the scheme was solvent.&quot;(Park Debates, 4th Series, Vol. XXXVIII., cols. 1259, 1261, 1279.)54. The basis of the rates of contribution then fixed, as put before Parliament, appears therefore to have been that^the officers&apos; contributions should suffice to pay the whole, or veryO  !IH4 b-3 c
nearly the whole, of the pension charges without imposing any liability on the ratepayer That at least is the plain meaning of the words used. It is, however, conceivable that what was intended to be conveyed was that the officers&apos; contributions would cover all the superan-nuation expenses over and above the charge, amounting to about 40,000Z-. a year, then falling on&apos; the rates by reason of the exercise by- the poor-law authorities of their discretionary power to grant pensions. But whichever interpretation be adopted the estimates of the promoters of the Bill were sadly falsified by the event. For the first year or two only did the total contri-butions suffice to meet the charges, and the outgoings have since increased year by year, until in the year 1913-14, out of a total pension charge of 220,0001. under the Act of 1896, only 63.000!. was met by contributions and the rest fell upon the rates.55. The influence of the poor-law scheme has no doubt been great. It was (with the exception of the police funds) the first of all existing contributory schemes for the officers of local authorities, and it is large and extensive. The Asylums Officers&apos; Superannuation Act, 1909, followed closely the lines then laid down. The promoters of the Newcastle scheme of 19.04, to which we have referred in paragraph 22, informed us that&apos; it influenced them, and there can be little doubt that it also powerfully affected a number of somewhat similar local -schemes. The basis on which the poor-law officers contributions were settled has therefore much significance for us.56. Turning now to the suggestions made to us during our inquiry, we find, that while the local authorities&apos; representatives desire a grant from the National Exchequer, they generally favour the idea that the balance of the money required should be found by the authorities and their officers in equal proportions. And this was the principle adopted by the National Association of Local Government Officers in the scheme to which reference has already been made (see paragraph 3). They there proposed that the employees should contribute a certain percentage (varying from 3 per cent, to 6 per cent.) of their salaries or wages and that the authorities should &quot; contribute a sum equal in amount to the sum which, during the year, had been contributed to the superannuation fund by their officers and servants.&quot; There was also a provision for a further levy on the authorities in case of a deficiency; but as the proposals purported to be on solvent lines, it is clear that the basis adopted was that of an equal contribution from both parties. ,57&apos;. We have come to the conclusion that this principle is the one which should be followed. We are satisfied that the employees&apos; contribution should be substantial. If it is not it is better to forego it altogether and thereby to get rid of the added complications and the suggestion of a divided burden which the contributory system involves. And we are equally satisfied that the employer should contribute substantially, for if he does not he will be obtaining a considerable advantage for which, in appearance at any rate, he will be paying very little. There is no division of the burden which can be shown to be justiand right to the exclusion of all others, for there is no exact apportionment possible of the advantages consequent on a scheme, but we believe it will be generally felt to be fair that the burden should be borne in equal shares by both parties. If either party is to be relieved it can only be done at the expense of his partner, and we are unwilling to ask a larger share than a half either from the employee or from the ratepayers, who will have in addition to deal with the serious problem of the back service of existing employees referred to later.  -58. We are of course aware that the total contribution required will very likely vary in the future, even if it can be accurately determined at the outset. -Improved vitality, and such a general rise of salaries as has recently taken place, must affect the solvency of all schemes which base contributions on annual salary and pensions on final salary. Such influences, and others, may recur, and may render a revision of rates of contribution necessary; but that is no reason for refusing to base them on some intelligible principle to start with. On the contrary, it adds to the value of such a principle, which will act as a guide in any future revision of. rates or alteration of benefits.59. We do not, however, consider that the rates of contribution, when once fixed, should, unless the benefits are altered, be varied for those employees who have entered the service under those rates. Any variation in either direction which the Actuary on a subsequent valuation may recommend should be taken&apos;up in the authorities&apos; contribution so far as the then, existing contributors are concerned, while new entrants should come in under the new rates on the half-and-half basis. But a change of benefits should involve a change of contribution for all concerned.Total contribution required.60. We are advised that the benefits we have recommended will require a total contribution of ten per cent, of salaries and wages five per cent, from the authorities and five per cent, froni the officers.The adequacy of this contribution depends partly on the net rate of interest earned by the invested moneys of the funds. We have assumed a rate of 3f per cent., which we do not think excessive unless the interest is likely to be subject to a high income tax payable over a long period. In that event the ten per cent, total contribution might have to be raised,   We understand that the question of the liability to tax of the income of super-
animation funds has-been brought to the notice of: the income Tax Commission now sitting. By arrangement with the Board of Inland Revenue those funds are at present relieved of tax where the interest earned does not exceed the pensions; but such relief cannot be material for many years after the commencement of a scheme such as ours, because the pension charge on the funds will be nil in the earlier years and will grow but slowly.Whether the same rate of contribution should be required from every class of employees,61. In connection with the basis of the calculations by which these percentages are arrived at we have closely considered the question whether and to what extent we should discriminate, in respect of contributions, between men and Avomen, or between &quot; officers &quot; and &quot; workmen.&quot; In respect of the various elements which enter into the actuarial calcula-tions, e.g., rates of mortality, retirement, withdrawal on marriage, gradation of salary scales, &amp;c, there are obvious differences between the sexes and between the different grades of employees, and while, in calculating contributions, some of these differences tend to neutralise one another, others do not. Were complexities of accounting and administration immaterial, and did discrimination present no difficulties, it might be advisable to recommend differential rates ; but, as we suggest elsewhere (see paragraphs 105 107), any attempt to discriminate gives rise to innumerable difficulties. Many of the classes are so closely related, from the point of view of emoluments that it is almost impossible to find dividing lines, while the data for discrimina-tion in the actuarial work required are almost entirely lacking. We are thus left with the alternatives of drawing distinctions which are in great measure arbitrary, and based on calculations which lack authority, or of. avoiding all distinctions and bringing every class of employees under one general scale of contributions. We think that the latter course is to be preferred, and we are strengthened in this conclusion by actuarial advice to the effect that practically every retiring officer will receive a pension of a value fully equivalent to the ten per cent, contribution paid by or in respect of him, with its accumulations at any rate of interest normally available for savings, the excess of the pension over this value in certain cases being met entirely from the differences between the reserves and the contributions refunded in cases of death or withdrawal. These differences arise chiefly from the contributions of the authorities in respect of deceased and Avithdrawing employees, which, with their interest accumulations, are retained by the fund. It appears to us that these particular moneys maybe appropriately brought in to aid to secure the great practical convenience of uniformity of contributions, and we find support for this view in the actuarial evidence tendered to the Departmental Committee on Railway Superannuation Funds, in connection with a problem which afforded a close parallel (see Parl. Paper Cd. 5349 of 1910).Whether the contributions should be graduated with reference to the age of entrants.- 62. We have also considered whether the contributions should be graduated with reference to the age of the employee on commencing to contribute. We have already stated, in paragraph 51, that in several existing schemes the contributions are graduated, but the criterion by which the graduation is settled varies, being sometimes the age of the employee, e.g., the Birmingham and Liverpool schemes, and sometimes his duration of past service at the time of commencing to contribute, without reference to his age, e.g., the Poor Law and Asylums Officers&apos; schemes and the Camberwell and Newcastle schemes. The duration of past service is not an element in the problem before us, since we propose that the pensions secured by the joint contributions payable into the fund, shall relate to the period of contri butory service, and the only element requiring consideration in this connection is that of age. As a consequence of the inclusion in our scheme of financial rights on the transfer of an employee from the service of one authority to that of another (see paragraph 92) the profits derived from the employees contributions in cases of &quot; lapse,&quot; which we are advised are partly responsible for the graduation of rates * in existing schemes for single authorities established on an actuarial basis, will be materially reduced, the result being to show a smaller degree of graduation than has generally been found appropriate. It would appear that if graduation, with age were introduced the appropriate joint contribution would not in any case be less than 9 per cent, of salary or more than 11 per cent., the latter figure being reached at ages 40-45, after which the rate would slightly decline in consequence of the restriction of pensions out of the fund to cases in which contributions had been made for a minimum period of 10 years. In these circumstances it appears to us that graduation is unnecessary, and that we may properly recommend the uniform joint rate of ten per cent, applicable, to all employees of ages not exceeding 55 years, as proposed in paragraph 60 above.Contribution from officers.63. The proposed five per cent, contribution by officers is more than that required under many existing schemes offering somewhat similar benefits. In these schemes, however, there is no discernible principle governing the apportionment of the cost between employer and employed.   Some of them were in substitution for discretionary pension powers, and this fact0 2
may account for the comparatively low rates asked from the officers, since where the power is discretionary no contributions can be asked. Some local schemes were inaugurated without actuarial advice, and the ratepayers were therefore ignorant of their proportion of the burden and of its magnitude. The combined current contributions prescribed have proved altogether inadequate, and a heavy deficiency levy is required for the purpose of maintaining solvency ; thus the real division of cost-between authority and officer has, in these cases, been entirely obscured.We have, on the contrary, proceeded upon the principle of an equal division of the cost between the two parties benefited. We think, moreover, that the rate asked from the officers is in itself a reasonable contribution in return for the valuable benefits secured. Regarded as an insurance against old age and invalidity, and, in a lesser degree, against death, it is an eminently good investment for any officer, and will, we believe, commend itself to the local government service generally.AUegatio)t that salaries are insufficient.64. Some of the evidence we received was mainly directed to shoAving that some employees of local authorities were inadequately paid, and pension rights were apparently sought rather as a means of compulsorily improving their position than for the sake of the inherent advantages of a scheme of superannuation. A corollary of this argument was that no contribution, or at most a very small contribution, should be made by the employees, into this field of inquiry we have no title and no wish to enter. It is for local authorities themselves to see that their staffs are properly paid; it is for us to devise a scheme of superannuation which will be fair to all parties on the hypothesis that the basic conditions of service are reasonable.Section V.- Back service; and future service of officers over 55 years of age.Back service.65. So far we have only considered the question of future service, whether rendered by existing officers or by new entrants; but, unless we deal with back service also, our proposals for the superannuation of existing officers who have been some time in the employment of local authorities will be incomplete, and we shall have left untouched the problem presented by those1 officers who have already reached the age of 65 or are approaching it. And it is just this problem which, as indicated in paragraph 28; calls for speedy action.66. The majority of us are not prepared to recommend that employees should be granted a statutory right to a pension in respect of back service. In most cases they accepted their positions with the full knowledge that no pension would or, indeed, could be given, and in some cases they specifically renounced any claim to a pension. Their remuneration was determined in the light of this knowledge, and there does not appear to us to be any justification for going back over the past, in some instances for more than 40 years, and, in effect, requiring the terms of service to be revised as from its inception. But, unless local authorities are granted power to give pensions to persons who have no right to claim them, there will be many old officers left, after years of useful work, without means of support in their old age, and there wdll be some authorities who will not be able to free themselves from the incubus of a senior staff no longer able to train the younger employees or to discharge properly their, own duties.We therefore propose that power should be given to local authorities to pension, in respect of their years of back service, all such officers as would have been entitled to contribute to the fund if it had been established Avhen they were appointed. But we do not consider that these pension charges should, be placed upon the fund. We suggest, not the imposition of an obligation upon the authorities, but the grant of a power to them; and, inasmuch as the poAver relates to past service only, there will be no contingent liability accruing from year to year which could be appropriately provided for by a yearly payment. We think therefore that these pensions or parts of pensions should be paid directly out of rates or revenues, apart from the operations of the fund. It follows from this method of dealing with back service that we do not propose that arrears of contributions in respect of such service should be required from, or paid by, officers. Such arrears are burdensome to pay and necessarily complicate the accounting and actuarial arrangements of the fund. And they are inappropriate in a scheme which makes pensions for back service optional on the authority and not obligatory. Moreover, many of the officers have no doubt made provision for their old age in some Avay or another, and so, in effect, provided a part of their pension, as they would have done under a contributory scheme.If a contributor Avith back service retires oAving to invalidity after less than 10 years of contributing service, Ave think that his years of contributing service should for this purpose be reckoned as back service. His contributions will, of course, be returned, to him, with interest, in accordance with our previous recommendation (see paragraph 42).
67. We have said above that we consider that the voluntary allowances in respect of back service should be paid directly out of rates or revenues. We have considered whether, as an alternative, it would be better to pay them out of a special fund maintained by a level charge on the rates, actuarially determined, and extending over a defined period as, in effect, is done, e.g,, under the present superannuation systems of the London County Council and the Liverpool. Corporation. Where a .definite liability is accepted in respect of back service there is much to be said in favour of this method of financing the arrangement, provided that the period over which the level charge is spread is not unduly prolonged, and we think that power should be given to authorities to constitute such a special equalising fund, if they see fit to do so.68. It remains to decide what should be the limit on the amount of pension which may be granted by an authority to an officer in respect of back service. We think that the authority should have power in ordinary cases to grant a pension up to the total amount which would have been provided by their own contributions if the scheme had been in operation from the beginning of the officers service. Since our proposals are based upon equal contributions from&apos; authorities and officers, it follows that such pensions would amount to about half the corresponding pensions in respect of future service. This may be con-veniently expressed by basing them on l/120th instead of l/60th of salary for each year of service. But we recognise that there may be cases in which for good reason the&apos; employing authority may desire to do more, and we therefore propose that authorities should be empowered to grant, by special resolution in each case, a more liberal pension in respect of back service, provided that in no case should the pension exceed l/60th of the average salary of the last five years for each year of back service, with a maximum of 40/60ths.69. A pension based on l/120ths is of considerable value. The following table shows the percentage of future salaries Avhich would have to be paid into an accumulative fund to provide such a pension : Duration of back service.	Age at commencing; to contribute.							25 years.	80 years.	85 years.	40 years.	45 years.	50 years.	55 years.	Per cent.	Per cent.	Per cent.	Per cent.	Per cent.	Per cent.

As there is no obligation on the authority to grant a pension in respect of back service, so there can be no corresponding obligation imposed on existing employees to retire at 65. But we think that no further contributions should be paid by either party in respect of service after that .age, nor should any service after that age be reckoned for pension purposes. It will always be open to the authority to bring the officers engagement to an end, and to grant him a pension if he is no longer able to render satisfactory service.Future service of officers over 55 years of age.71. As provided in paragraph 42, no contributions can be paid in respect of the future service of any officer who is over 55 at the time when the scheme comes into operation, since: he would not be able to contribute for 10 years, which is the minimum period required to qualify for a pension.We have already, in paragraphs 65 to 70, stated how, in our opinion, back service should be . dealt with for purposes of superannuation; and we recommend that in calculating the pension no distinction should be made between the back service and the future service of officers who by reason of being over 55 at the time when the scheme comes into operation are ineligible to become contributors. Such officers will not come upon the fund, which will be concerned solely with new entrants and the future service of existing employees who are under- 55 years of age at the commencement of the scheme.* In the case of an employee invalided before completing 10 years of contributory service, the pension payable (if he has served 10 years in all) has for the purposes of the table been calculated on his whole period of service.
Section VI.-Constitution of proposed fund or funds.Whether there should be a separate fund for each local authority.72. There remains one more important question to be settled before the outlines of our scheme are complete, and that is concerned with the constitution of the proposed fund or funds. We cannot contemplate the establishment of a separate fund for each local authority concerned. There are no less than 3,000 such authorities in England and Wales, not counting 660 poor-law authorities and 21,500 parochial authorities. Many of these, especially among the older municipal borough councils and the urban district councils, are very small, whether measured by the rateable value of their areas, or the salaries of the staffs they employ. We may quote the following as examples :-Highest (pre-war)Produce of hi. salary paid to anyName of council.        i rate, officer.Town Council of     Hedon       ...... 14 40Wareham 22 .50Shaftesbury -     ...     .     . 26 80Penryn      ........ 30 80Appleby...... 39 90Calne.....- 50 - 130Cardigan    ...... 50 90Ueban District Council of Bonsall      ...... 13 77Compstall   -     -     -     -     -      - 18 35Buglawton...... 22 30Ampthill    ...... 41 -                 90Wigton      ...... 42 110Torpoint    ....... 49 150Wantage 50 150A separate superannuation fund for every one of these authorities, even if practicable, would be unsatisfactory because the staffs are too small to lead to average results and the retirement of even one senior officer might entirely disturb the fund.Whether there should be a single central fund.73. We have therefore devoted much attention to the possibility of setting up a single central fund fed by the contributions of all the local authorities&apos;and their officers the system proposed by the National Association of Local Government Officers in the scheme already alluded to. This plan has much to recommend it, inasmuch as it unites the advantage of the freest opportunities of interchange between the various staffs, the averaging of all risks, and the smallest aggregate amount of administrative work. But, in spite of this, we have been compelled to reject it.74. The problem is one of the most difficult with which we have been faced. For the purpose of setting up a joint fund, the solvency of which would depend to a large extent on the action of the constituent bodies, we. should have to bring all the numerous separate and independent authorities into one combination. We are therefore confronted by these alternatives: either the separate authorities would have to submit to the control of a central body, responsible for the management and solvency of the fund, and this they would warmly repudiate, or the solvency of the fund would be at the mercy of their separate action without their having individually more than an indirect and remote responsibility for it. It is important to realise how serious this latter alternative is. Nothing affects the actuarial calculations on which a fund of this kind rests more vitally than scales of salary. The amount of salary paid is immaterial, but the rate of increment by which it rises is of primary importance in calculating the percentage of annual salary required to provide a proportion of final salary.75. We have attempted to ascertain the probable variations in the requisite cOn-tribution, measured as a percentage of salary, attributable to variations in the salary scale. For this purpose we. have examined a number of valuation, and other returns prepared in connection with existing funds and schemes and have constructed three scales of hypothetical average salaries,&apos; the first two of which we regard as illustrating generally the conditions under the smaller authorities and in the counties and larger boroughs respectively. The third we regard as representative of a few exceptional authorities in which the staff includes a comparatively large proportion of administrative and technical officers of the higher grades. The first scale, which we call X, gives at the age of 60 an average salary 50 per cent, higher than the average salary at the age of 30. The second (Y) gives an average increase in salary of 66f per cent, between the ages of 30 and 60. The third (Z) shows an average salary at 60 of rather more than double the average at 30.
looal authorities in &quot;england and wales !    report.93t-iOTalcing 20 as the entry ago for superannuation purposes, tho percentages of salary during service required as contributions to pay for the benefits mentioned in paragraph-1-2 would bear the. following relationship:Scale X. : Scale Y. : Scale Z.as 9&apos;4 : 10&apos;0 : 11&apos;5.The relationship varies with the age at entry, and according to the assumptions made as to mortality, invalidity, &amp;c., but it is clear from these figures that the divergencies between the contributions required under the various types of salary increments are very considerable and that we should run the risk of doing a serious injustice if the superannuation liabilities of all authorities were pooled and a common rate of contribution applied to their liquidation.76. But, according to returns furnished to us, not only do the salary scales, where they exist, of the rural authorities differ altogether from those of the councils of the great towns, but many of the smaller authorities have no scales or system of promotion. Age and conditions of entry also vary. It would be a bold step, haying applied the same percentage of salaries to provide superannuation under such varying conditions, to pay the resulting contributions into one central, fund and expect that fund to operate without injustice to any of the contributing authorities.77. Salary scales, varieties in conditions of service, age and conditions of entry to the service, are all matters of domestic concern in which control of the local authorities by a central body would be most difficult and unwelcome. Sometimes the interest of the authority would even be opposed to that of the fund, as in the case of an officer, not too efficient, whose retirement would be facilitated if lie could qualify for an invalidity pension, ft is evident that from this uncertain material no Actuary could derive tables of much value. They might represent an average condition at a given moment; but they would probably represent the conditions of no single authority and they would certainly represent no stable conditions. In any fund based on such calculations some authorities, or some classes of authorities, would obviously be relieved of part of their pension liabilities at the expense of. others, and it might well, be that the relief was material. It is clear, for example, that in the case of the three scales mentioned in paragraph 75, if contributions were based on Scale Y, the contributions in the case of an authority whose salaries moved on Scale X would&quot; be about 6 per cent, too high, while in the case of an authority to which Scale Z applies, the contributions would be about 15 per cent, too low. The extreme variations as between individual authorities would probably exceed those indicated. And while these inequalities might be accepted without question at first, it is unlikely that they would stand the strain of a deficiency levy should such be required. For at once it would be asked, what was the cause of the deficiency, to whose action was it due, and who therefore should meet it, and immediately the weaknesses of the scheme would be revealed and confidence would be lost. This kind of difficulty was acutely felt by the Select Committee of the House of Commons referred to in paragraph 12, which, had under consideration a proposal to amalgamate all the separate police pension funds either into one fund or into three or four large district funds, and reported &quot; that the difficulties of disposing equitably of the existing funds and adjusting the payments to be made by the different localities, added to the greater difficulty of constituting such a board of management as would secure the confidence and support of the contributing authorities, form such serious Obstacles&apos;to the amalgamation scheme that, notwithstanding its advantages, they are unable to recommend it.&quot; Add to this the dangers which might arise out of the accumulation of po large a fund, and the criticisms which would be levelled against its management if its assets proved insufficient.Few or none of these difficulties can occur where the fund belongs to a single authority; for then the responsibility for the management and solvency of the fund and the control of the variable elements which affect its solvency are in the same hands. But they appear to us to be insuperable where a large number of widely differing and independent authorities are involved.78. A very similar problem has confronted the promoters of the Railway Clearing System Superannuation Fund Corporation. The Corporation is organised for the purpose of providing, out of a, fund on an actuarial basis, superannuation and similar allowances for persons, most of whom are employed either by the Railway Clearing House Committees or by the smaller railway companies of the United Kingdom which have no separate superannuation funds or schemes of their own. The contributing members include general managers and every other grade of salaried railway employees, down to junior clerks and apprentices. For the purposes of the fund contributions are obtained from both employers and employees. There is (with an unimportant exception) one scale of benefits for all contributing employees. The number of employing bodies (about 50) and employees (about 13,000) contributing is very much smaller than the corresponding number of local authorities (upwards of 3,00.0) and their officers (about 60.000) contemplated by the National Association of Local Government Officers as contributors to. the Central Fund proposed by them ; but in other respects the analogy between the proposed Central. Fund and the Clearing System Fund is close, We have there-fore given careful consideration to its recorded experience.
One typo of difficulty which the Clearing System Fund has met with is shown in the following extract from its Secretary&apos;s evidence before the Departmental Committee of 1910 on the Superannuation and similar Funds of Railway Companies (Parliamentary Paper Cd. 5484):-.The Committee managing the fund have no influence over the economic policy of the several contributing companies, and therefore the companies, by adopting a different economic policy, at any time may upset the basis of the fund. The respective companies composing the Clearing House make alterations in their policy of manage-ment, causing earlier retirement, without consulting the Committee. That is how they can upset the basis of the fund (Q. 1293 and Q. 1294).Another type of difficulty experienced by the Clearing System Fund appears to have arisen from continuous pressure exercised upon the Committee of Management by the widely scattered contributors for &quot; larger pensions, and at the same time with a view of promoting the flow of promotion in the railway service&quot; (Q. 1100).A third type of difficulty has arisen when recurring actuarial valuations have disclosed deficiencies in the fund. On some of these occasions, we gather, there have been sharp differences of opinion among the several employing bodies as to how the deficiencies should be met, and no less sharp differences of opinion among the contributing employees. We gather, too, from the evidence given in the above-mentioned Parliamentary Paper, that some employing companies have seceded from the fund. In our opinion similar difficulties would inevitably occur in connection with any central superannuation fund established on an actuarial basis and fed by contributions from all the local authorities of England and Wales and their officers.79. Our attention has been called to the following examples of the actual or proposed centralisation of the finance and management of contributory superannuation schemes affecting persons employed by local bodies : (i) The scheme for deferred annuities under the Elementary School Teachers (Super-annuation) Acts, 1898 and 1912 ;(ii) The scheme for superannuation allowances for Scottish School Teachers, framed in1911 under the Education (Scotland) Act, 1908 ;(iii) The schemes under the National School Teachers (Ireland) Act, 1879 ;(iv) The federated superannuation scheme for universities described in ParliamentaryPapers Cd. 6617 of 1912-13 and Cd. 6869 of 1913 ; (v) The scheme recommended for secondary teachers by the Departmental Committee onthe Superannuation of Teachers which reported in 1914 (Cd. 7364);. (vi) The scheme recommended by the Departmental Committee on the Superannuation of Officers of Reformatory and Industrial Schools which reported in 1916.The first of these schemes merely provided for deferred annuities at age 65 by means of fixed annual deductions from teachers&apos; salaries, the annuity value of such deductions at each year of the teacher&apos;s age being fixed by tables under the Act of 1898. The fourth is also a money-purchase scheme, and is worked through assurance societies. The fifth and sixth were to be similarly worked but neither has been actually adopted.Out of all these schemes, only two, the Scottish and Irish Teachers&apos; pension schemes, provide for the payment of pension on disablement after a comparatively short -period of service,-a benefit without which, we are convinced, no superannuation scheme will be acceptable to the rank and file of the local government service.Of these two, again, only the Scottish scheme provides for a contribution by the local authority, which we regard as an essential feature of our scheme. This scheme related to a homogeneous class of employees and was controlled by a single Government Department, which was able to collect the contributions both of the managers and of the teachers by deducting them from the grants administered by it. Nor have its financial results been tested in operation, since it was superseded before any valuation of the fund had been made.We can find, therefore, in the history of these schemes no support for the theory that it is practicable to establish and maintain a central superannuation fund to which all local authorities and their servants shall contribute and out of which shall be granted not only annuities payable on the attainment of a certain age but annuities payable on disablement after 10 years of service.80. We have dealt at some length with these points, for it was only with reluctance that we gave up the idea of a single fund, of the unworkability of which we were, however, finally convinced. We were thus left with the necessity of devising some plan which should involve neither a separate fund for each authority nor a single fund for all.Separate funds for county boroughs and other large towns.81. If all county boroughs, all metropolitan boroughs, and all municipal boroughs and urban districts with a population of not less than 50,000 were separately dealt with, the chief disturbing and unassimilable factor would be eliminated.  Nor is there any reason why they
Joint funds for the other local authorities in each county.83. We are then left with the county councils and other authorities, largely rural in character but embracing all the smaller towns. It would no doubt be possible by grouping these in homogeneous classes (i.e., urban district councils in one class, rural district councils in another, and so on), to form funds which would not be exposed to the weaknesses, pointed out in paragraphs 74-78, arising from serious disparities in the scales of salaries and conditions of service in the various constituent authorities. Such disparities as exist in authorities of the same class are relatively slight and would perhaps tend to disappear if the authorities concerned were brought together in one group for superannuation purposes. But such a grouping would not avoid other weaknesses to which a central fund is open. The management of a fund including authorities from Northumberland to Cornwall would have to be entrusted to some central body, which might be in some Avay representative of the contributing authorities, but which would certainly have to take the control out of the hands of the authorities themselves. To this, as indicated above, there are serious objections. But if the grouping were by counties, we believe that most of these objections would vanish.84. There are, no doubt, disparities betAveen the conditions of service under the rural authorities and the conditions under the councils of the smaller &quot;boroughs and urban districts in the same county, but they are certainly much less than the disparities which would arise from grouping the larger towns Avith the rural areas, and we believe they are insufficient to affect materially their respective contributions to a joint superannuation fund.85. There would! also be a disparity between the conditions prevailing in such a group, taken as a Avhole, and the conditions of service under the council of the county in which the group was situated. But the resulting error in contribution has no practical significance for the ratepayer. For suppose that the effect of grouping the smaller authorities with the county council were to relieve the county ratepayer at the expense of the local (i.e., borough and district) ratepayer, the local rates would be a little too high and the county rate a little too low; but as the same person would pay both rates the increase in the one rate would be off-set by the decrease in the other. Small differences, practically negligible in amount, there might be, owing to the incidence of the county rate upon certain classes of property (e.g., railways, agricultural land) differing from the incidence of the general district rate. But absolute perfection is unattainable, and we believe that the likelihood of injustice arising from this plan is very slight.86. Moreover, with a county grouping, another of the serious objections to a single fund disappears, for it would be possible to set up Avithin the county a joint body representing all the contributing authorities and meeting at a place accessible to all, through Avhich a real control&apos; could be exercised by those authorities themselves in matters affecting the solvency and management of the fund for Avhich they Avere jointly responsible: Joint bodies, such as these,&quot; to deal Avith matters of common concern to a county council and other local authorities for areas Avithin the county, have been set up under various statutes. Representa-tion on the joint body should as nearly as practicable be in proportion to contribution, proper arrangements being made for any grouping of authorities which may be necessary to avoid the creation of a body of unwieldy size.87. Our recommendation accordingly is that in each county outside London a superannua-tion fund should be established, fed by the contributions of the county council and smaller local authorities and their officers, and managed by a joint body representative of the authorities concerned and constituted under a scheme approved by the Central Department. The administrative expenses should be shared by the contributing authorities in proportion to their contributions.O  9144 1)should not he so treated. In drawing the line at a population of 50,000 we mark off those authorities avIiosc staffs are organised on a basis suitable to thickly populated areas and large enough to warrant the existence of a separate fund. We therefore recommend that a separate fund should be established by each of such authorities.82. There will be in the areas of these authorities a few minor authorities (overseers, burial boards, &amp;c.) whose officers are not employed by the council of the borough or urban district. We consider that the most convenient method of dealing with such cases is that the officers should be treated for the purpose of superannuation as if they were employed by the council, the necessary contributions being paid into the fund by the employing authority. The number of such persons as compared to the total number of contributors in the area will be too small to affect the fund or to- justify any more complicated method of providing for them. In cases where the council of the borough or urban district appoint the majority of the members of a joint sewerage board or similar joint authority, their officers should likewise, we think, be treated for the purposes of superannuation as if they were officers of the council. The employing authority should have the right to be consulted upon any question affecting the superannuation of one of their officers.
Arrangements in the metropolitan area.88, With regard to London, there will be separate funds for the London County Council, the Corporation of the City of London, and for each of the Metropolitan Borough Councils (see paragraph 120); and any minor authorities (such as are referred to in paragraph 82) should be dealt with through one or other of these funds.Large joint authorities.89. The Metropolitan Water Board will have a separate fund ; and there may be a few other joint authorities outside London whose staffs will be large enough to justify separate funds.Total number of funds.90. The total number of separate funds which might be set up if effect were given to our recommendations would be about 200, made up as follows : London County Council and Metropolitan Borough Councils (including theCorporation of the City of London).......30County councils (excluding the London County Council)   -     -     -     -  61Councils of county boroughs.....&apos; -     -     -     -82Councils of non-county boroughs and of other urban districts having a population of not less than 50,000 .....-     -     -17Metropolitan Water Board and certain other joint authorities    -     -(say)   10We think, however, that provision should be made for enabling any two or more funds to be united to form a single fund. There will, we believe, be many cases- in which a voluntary aggregation would be advantageous and should be encouraged.There will be certain cases in which an authority&apos;s district overlaps the boundary of a superannuation area. It will be for the authorities concerned or, failing agreement, for the Central Department to decide to which superannuation area the district should be assigned..As to representation of officers on the bodies managing the funds.91. It would be in accord with modern tendencies, which have our full sympathy, that officers as well as authorities should be included in the bodies managing funds. The enlarged size of the bodies would be an inconvenient consequence of such a plan, but not an insuperable objection to it. The real obstacle lies in our decision that the authorities alone should be responsible for making good any deficiency which may arise in the fund. Joint management of the fund must carry with it joint responsibility for its solvency. We should have no objection to a scheme involving both, although its practical advantages are not obvious, as the benefits to be given by the pension scheme must be clearly defined and would leave little or no room for the exercise of discretion on the part of the management. But believing as we do that the employees would not unreasonabiy object to accept any responsibility for deficiencies (arising otherwise than, from increase of benefits) we feel unable to give them any share in the management.&apos; Interchange of employment without loss of pension rights.92. Our scheme will not be satisfactory unless we&apos;are able to facilitate interchange between the staffs of the various authorities without loss of pension rights; and, with all the funds on a uniform basis, that should present no difficulty. It is only necessary to provide that, in the event of the transfer of an officer from the service of an authority contributing ,.to one fund to that of an authority contributing to another fund, payment should be made by the former fund to the latter of a sum equal to the value of the officers accrued pension rights. A table of transfer values should be settled for this purpose by the Central Depart-ment, giving, for each age, the appropriate value per   of salary, at the time of transfer, of any number of years during which the officer has been employed and in respect of which contributions have been paid. The new employer will know how much will be received on transfer, and how many years of service rank, and will be informed of the amount of the contri-butions already made by the officer. If the officer leaves subsequently to go to a third authority, the transfer value will have to be based on the total of contributing service.This method has the effect of making the pension authority for the area in which the officer is employed at the time of his retirement entirely responsible for everything to do with his pension. It requires no complicated bookkeeping and has the merit of simplifying valuations.&apos; Periodical valuation of funds.93. We think that all the funds should, be valued at stated intervals, say, of seven years. The basis of valuation should be prescribed by the Central Department so as&apos; to prevent
valuations being based on varying or conflicting principles and to reduce tlie actuarial labour to a minimum.   And, in order to effect a still further simplification, we suggest that ail valuations should be made by the Government Actuary.   Any deficiency or disposable surplus revealed by a valuation should be followed by the adjustment of contributions as recommended in paragraph 59.Revision of rates of contribution. .  &quot;94. It is evident from the considerations advanced in paragraphs 74 to 77 that the; v original contribution, if accurately determined for the authorities as a whole, will be too high in some cases and too low in others, and that adjustment of contributions will be: required in some cases. The initial error could not be avoided by a preliminary investigation into the conditions, of service under each separate authority, because until the scheme has been in operation for some years the necessary data as regards salary, invalidity, mortality, &amp;c, must remain uncertain. We are satisfied that preliminary valuations are impracticable, and could not be made sufficiently reliable ; they would, moreover, delay the inauguration of the scheme for a considerable time. When the periodical valuations are made, the contributions of the authorities will be adjusted to make good any deficiency or to absorb any surplus above such amount as the Actuary may consider should be kept in reserve. After each valuation the Actuary should certify in regard to each fund the contributions to be charged during the next period. The conditions revealed by successive valuations may ultimately justify a modification of the contributions of officers subsequently appointed to posts with certain authorities, but we do not think it desirable that frequent changes should be made in these contributions, and we do not anticipate that any change will be made until experience justifies a substantial variation for an appreciable number of funds. Here, as in all matters depending on valuation, the decision of the Actuary must be final.Medical examination.95. The body managing a fund should, we think, satisfy itself of the medical fitness of existing officers of less than 10 years&apos; service, and of new. entrants to the service, before admitting them as contributors.96. Any claim to an invalidity allowance out of a fund should be supported by medical evidence satisfactory to the body managing the fund.Investment of funds.97. Among the powers of investment of monies under their control possessed by authorities managing funds should be included a power to lend money to constituent and other local authorities. A local authority having a separate fund should be authorised (as in recent local Acts) to borrow from the fund, subject to the rate of interest charged being not less than the market rate current at the time of borrowing. . . ;; .-... Audit of accounts.93. The accounts of the several funds should be kept in a form to be prescribed by the Central Department and be audited under regulations made by the Department.Assignment of superannuation allowances.99. Safeguards against the assignment of pensions should be provided as in recent local Acts.Section VII.-Classes of persons embraced by the scheme.Temporary employees necessarily excluded.100. The framework of our scheme is now complete, and we have to consider the latter part of our reference. First of all, what classes of officials or employees should the scheme embrace ? If superannuation is an advantage to both employers and employed, then the more widely it can be extended the better. But certain classes of employees cannot be included. Continuity of employment is of the essence of any superannuation scheme, and all temporary servants must therefore be ruled out.  (See also paragraph 122.)Tart-time officers.101. The position of part-time officers is, not so clear. To rule them out altogether would be to render the scheme of little value to the large number of small authorities whose work is not sufficient to warrant the employment of whole-time officers, at any rate in the higher posts. This would be a misfortune. On the other hand, to include them all, as does the poor-law scheme, would be to take in a large number of persons many of them employed by parochial authorities who for a small salary, perhaps not exceeding  10 a year, give a.littleD 2
of their time to the public service while the bulk of it is devoted to their own business. Probably the small farmers, traders, or other persons, avIio, as assistant overseers, are engaged in the collection of the rates in rural parishes, are the most numerous employees of thistvPe- .   . we see ho adequate reason for bringing such persons into the scheme.  We have,however, been strongly pressed in certain quarters to include- all part-time officers, and itappears to be assumed by those who advocate their inclusion that the reasons for providingsuperannuation  are equally applicable to  all permanent officers, irrespective of theamount of time devoted to the public service.   We do not accept this assumption.The granting of a pension is usually associated with, and arises out of, the obligation ofan officer to devote his whole time to the service of his employer and the correspondingobligation of the employer to see that the officers maintenance is provided for aslong as he lives.   This basic consideration does not apply in the case of part-time officers&apos; who, ex hypothesi, have other means of livelihood with which the public body is in no wayconcerned, and which may be sufficient of themselves to ensure the maintenance of such officers.  Moreover, the obligation referred to is especially strong in the case of the admini-strative officials of a public body Avhose knowledge and experience, while valuable to thepublic, is of much less value in the open market, a consideration which applies with much less force, if at all, toinost part-time officers.   Again, many men take part-time employmentunder a public body partly for the prestige and assistance they anticipate will be derivedtherefrom in carrying out their professional or other work.   Nor is it necessary that a definiteretiring age, such as forms one of the principal arguments for a superannuation scheme,should be fixed in such cases, for part-time service can often be effectively rendered longafter the age at which a Avhole-time servant usually begins to lose his efficiency.We think that a reasonable distinction could be made between those part-time officers, thegreater part of whose services is given to a local authority and other part-time employees,but we fear that, in practice, the difficulty of determining whether particular officers come within this category would be formidable.   We recommend therefore that all permanentpart-time officers in receipt of salaries or wages and emoluments amounting to not less than 50 a year should be pensionable, and that officers receiving less than  50 a year should be excluded from, the scheme unless they and their employing authorities mutually agree to their inclusion.102. If a part-time officer who is a contributor is subsequently appointed to a whole-time post, we think his years of part-time service should not be reckoned in full, in so far as they are applied, for the purpose of calculating pension, to a salary received for whole-time service,* but that an appropriate adjustment should be made in each case.103. There are many persons who are in the part-time service of two or more local authorities. In such cases the income received from the employing authorities should be aggregated for the purpose of determining eligibility. All contributions in respect of an individuals part-time service should be paid to one fund, and if doubt arises as to which fund he should join, the question should, failing agreement, be determined by the Central Department.Persons indirectly employed.104. The case of persons indirectly employed by a local authority, i.e., engaged and paid by an official of a local authority for the purpose of assisting him in his work, has been brought before us on several occasions. Such persons are not the officers of the authority, and cannot be * treated exactly as if they were. If they are to receive the advantages of the scheme, we think they should cease to be employed by an official, and become the [officers of the authority. We understand, however, that in the present state of the law this is difficult in the case of certain appointments; and, if in such cases any individual is appointed with the concurrence of, and under conditions approved by, the local authority, we think he should be included in the scheme if the authority so decide.Workmen.&apos; 105. The case of workmen presents certain special difficulties, on which we sought the advice of the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress. Their Secretary communicated to us a resolution of the Joint Board of the Trades Union Congress, the General. Federation of Trade Unions, and the Labour Party that &quot; it was not desirable that any scheme should be approved which separated the workmen from the officials ; &quot; but, in response to further inquiries which we made, we obtained the reply that the Committee had come to the conclusion not to tender evidence in connection with the matter under our consideration.106. The conditions under which workmen are employed by local authorities vary in different parts of the country. In some places the workmen, or some of them, are permanent j officers of the local authorities, receive sick pay, and have pension rights (eg., under the Poor Law Officers&apos; Superannuation Act, 1896, and under some local Acts); in others they are engaged on strict trade union conditions, with no definite expectation of continuous employ-ment, no allowance of sick pay, and no right to pensions ; and both systems, or variations of them, seem to be acceptable to the persons concerned and to work satisfactorily.  We have
Section VIII.-Technical officers in the education service having experience as teachers.108. A special claim was submitted to us on behalf of certain classes of officers in the employment of local education authorities whose work requires a knowledge of educational technique and who, it was urged, should, if they have had experience as teachers, be brought within the terms of the School Teachers (Superannuation) Act. 1918. We had the advantage of hearing evidence from representatives of the Association of Directors and Secretaries for Education in support of this claim. It was recognised by them that, under the Act of 1918, certain administrative officers may obtain pensions in respect of each year of their teaching service. But subsequent administrative service by these officers does not count towards pension under the Act of 1918; and the average salary on which the pension is to be calculated is that which was obtained during the final years of teaching service and not that which was obtained during the final years of administrative service.109. It was not contended by these representatives that the reasons by Avhich the introduction of that Act was justified by the President ,of the Board of Education (see paragraph 35) apply to administrative officers who had ceased to be teachers at that time; but it is apparently felt by some persons that education is so distinct from all the rest of the work of local authorities that those engaged in it, whether teachers or technical officers having had experience as teachers, should be separated from the rest of the staff and grouped in a class by themselves. They urge, moreover, that the present conditions have created serious anomalies which should be removed, and that recruitment of the local education administrative service will be seriously prejudiced if teachers avIio enter that branch of the service to occupy posts for which their teaching experience may have specially qualified them must cease to accumulate further benefits under the Act - of last year. We do not share the vieAv that the administrative side of the local educational service should be segregated from all other local administrative services and put, for superannuation purposes, with the teachers, in an entirely separate class; on the contrary, we hold that we should tend in the direction of emphasising the interests Avhich administrative officers employed in education Avork have in common Avith other local officers. But, in any event, the ideal put before us by these witnesses is practically unattainable by means of any proposals which they made. Not only would such persons as architects, financial officers, and other officers engaged in educational administration, be excluded from the educational division, but many technical officers Avhose Avork is wholly educational in the narroAver sense (including some directors themselves) are Avithout the qualifications suggested to us by the witnesses and would therefore still remain outside the scope of the scheme under the Act of 1918. The staffs of the local education authorities Avould thus still be split in tAvo, but they Avould be split in a different place and by a line less logical and intelligible than that Avhich now divides teachers from others. And while some anomalies would be removed, it appears to us that others more striking would be created. We do not therefore recommend the extension of the scheme under the Act of 1918 to these officers. But a teacher who is offered an administrative post for Avhich teaching experience is a desirable qualification will naturally be less ready to entertain the offer if his period of service as a teacher is to count for little or nothing when he reaches the age of retirement. &apos; If years of pensionable service as a &apos; teacher Avere for superannuation purposes aggregated with subsequent years of pensionable administrative service, Ave believe that the case presented to us would be substantially met.d 3come to the conclusion that the right course is to make no distinction between different classes of employees on the permanent staff, and we are fortified in this decision by the difficulty of framing for the present purpose any definition which, would satisfactorily distinguish work-men from other employees of the local authority. A distinction based upon the amount of weekly earnings was always unsatisfactory and has become impossible owing to recent rises in wages ; and a distinction between persons paid at daily or weekly rates and persons paid by salary would not coincide with but would cut across the division * between workmen and others.Scheme to apply to all whole-time established employees.107. We conclude therefore that all persons who are employed whole-time in an established capacity should come within the scheme whatever the nature of their Avork. Such persons may be defined as those appointed by resolution of the local authority or a committee thereof duly authorised in that behalf. This will, of: course, still leave a good deal to the discretion of local authorities, who will have to decide in the future, as in the past, whether a given officer or class of officers should be appointed to the permanent established staff or not. This discretion extends to the whole of the staff, whether workmen or others; and, so far from being a drawback, we regard it as an advan-tage that sufficient elasticity should remain to allow local authorities and their officers to make whatever arrangements may best agree with local feeling, local custom, and the convenience of the work on which the officers will be engaged.
110. We think that this can best be done by providing that, on transfer of a teacher to pensionable service on the administrative stall of a local authority, the Treasury should pay, to the fund to which he will contribute, a transfer value which would be found by applying to the table of values (see paragraph 92) the years of service recognisable under the School Teachers (Superannuation) Act, 1918. The officer would be credited with an arbitrary sum, say, one-third of the transfer value, for back contributions to the fund, which sum would accumulate, together with his subsequent contributions, for contingent return on his death. In the event, however, of leaving the service, he would be entitled only to the return of his own contributions and not to any part of the transfer value. A transfer value should be paid to the Treasury in respect of any local government officer who, being a contributor to a local fund, subsequently joins the education service and comes under the School Teachers (Superannuation) Act, 1918, provided that his service with a local authority, for which the transfer value is paid, is allowed to rank as service towards pension under that Act.Section IX.-Relation of proposed scheme to existing schemes.111. The last part of our reference requires us to make recommendations as to the relation of any scheme we may propose to any existing superannuation schemes. These may be briefly summarised as follows : (i) the Police scheme, (ii) the Poor Law Officers&apos; scheme, (iii) the Asylums and Certified Institutions Officers&apos; schemes, and (iv) schemes under various local Acts. Particulars of the history and development of these schemes will be found in the first part of this Report (paragraphs 12 to 26).If the proposals we have made are in themselves reasonable and sound, it would be an advantage that as many as possible of the existing schemes should be merged in. that which we recommend. The interchange of staff employed by all the contributing authorities would thereby be facilitated, simplicity and economy of administration would result, and a single scheme based on simple and intelligible principles would take the place of a number, of differing schemes which have grown up without much reference to one another and without any very clear basis. But the feasibility of such a merger depends on a sufficiently close similarity between the conditions and rates of benefit. There is no advantage in a merely nominal merger of two or more schemes involving different conditions and different benefits.Police.112. These considerations prevent us from recommending that our scheme should be extended to cover the police. As stated above (paragraph 5) we have abstained from all detailed inquiry into their pensions ; but it is evident that the police form a force wholly apart from the rest of the officers of local authorities. Not only are their conditions of service quite different, but their pension rights are far more valuable than those of any other class of persons coming within our purview, with the exception of certain firemen whose case is dealt with below (para. 113). The separate Departmental Committee Avhich is now investigating, among other questions, the pensions of the police, clearly contemplate that they shall not be placed on a similar footing to the bulk, of local authorities&apos; officers in this respect (Command Paper 253 of Session 1919), and we do not suggest that anything should be done to bring the police within our scheme.Firemen.113. In many of the larger municipal boroughs having separate police forces the fire brigade has been made part of the police force (e.g., in pursuance of a resolution passed by the town council under section 2 of the Police Act, 1893), and in.this way the members of the brigade have become entitled to superannuation out of the police pension fund of the borough; and in some boroughs the members of -the fire brigade may be superannuated under local Acts. The provisions of section 2 of the Police Act, 1893, do not, however, apply to boroughs and other areas policed by the metropolitan and county forces ; and in some of the boroughs with separate police forces the councils have neither made the fire brigade a part of the police force nor obtained powers by local Act to superannuate the members of the brigade.The members of the London Fire-Brigade have a superannuation scheme on a non-contributory basis under the Metropolitan Fire Brigade Act, 1865. Their pensions are on a scale approximating to that of the Metropolitan Police.&apos; The membership of the whole-time brigades in England and Wales for whose super-annuation no provision has been made is generally small, and it is outside the scoDe of our duties to inquire whether they can or should be combined with the police forces of the areas in which they act.The members of thefLondon Fire Brigade and the members of fire brigades pensionable as police should not, we think, be brought within the general scheme recommended by us, hut we are of opinion that the scheme should be applied in its entirety to the other members of fire brigades employed by. local authorities.
scheme on the new conditions. Ft may well be that some of the younger officers will desire to do this, in spite of the larger contributions required, for the sake of the fuller opportunities of transfer to the service of other authorities and the greater consequent scope for advancement.Teachers in poor-law schools.117. The case of teachers in poor-law schools will also be governed by the recommenda-tions of the same Report. Those teachers who have not hitherto come under the provisions of the School Teachers (Superannuation) Act, 1918, solely on the ground, that they are teachers in poor-law schools, should have the option, on becoming the servants of local education authorities, of coming under the provisions of that Act, with adequate provision for aggregating their past pensionable service with the service they may thereafter render. We were informed by their representatives that they do not claim the return of past contributions, which have not been funded but have gone in relief of current rates. Other teachers (if any) in poor-law schools will, with similarly situated teachers now in the employment of local education authorities, come under the provisions of the new scheme. These results accord with the recommendations we should have made had the question still been completely open.Persons employed in asylums and certified institutions.118. The schemes provided for in the Asylums Officers (Superannuation) Act, 1909, and the Asylums and Certified Institutions (Officers Pensions) Act, 1918, though modelled generally on the poor-law scheme, differ from it in important particulars. Under the Act of 1909 asylums officers (i.e., officers in lunatic asylums and in the Metropolitan Asylums Board asylums for imbeciles) were divided into two classes. The first class consists of those established officers who have charge of patients in the usual course of their employment. The second class includes all other established officers in the asylums. To the officers in the first class was granted the right to retire after 20 years of service at the age of 55 on a pension based on 50ths of salary and emoluments. To the officers in the second class was granted the right to retire after 20 years of service at the age of 60 on a pension based on 60ths of salary and emoluments. The Act of 1918 applies the provisions of the Act of 1909 to officers employed in the care of defectives in certified institutions provided by local authorities under the Mental Deficiency Act, 1913. All the officers to whom, the Act of 1918 applies, are, however, to be treated, subject to certain modifications, as officers of the second class under the Act of 1909.119. It will be observed that these benefits differ in two essential points from those enjoyed by poor-law officers and contemplated by us. In the first place the retiring age is earlier for all asylums officers, and, in the second place, for officers in Class I, which is by far -the larger class, the rate of pension is higher. It does not lie within our reference to consider whether the superior advantages thus granted to the officers of asylums and certified institutions are justified. We have taken no evidence and express no opinion on the point, and we assume for our purpose that the benefits to which they are entitled are appropriate and will be maintained. And that being so we have no alternative but to exclude them from, our proposals, since it is impracticable, as explained above (para. Ill), to include in a single scheme persons entitled to widely differing benefits. It will be evident from the earlier part of our Report that the nature of the scheme under which they are brought by the Acts of 1909 and 1918 is not such as * commends itself to us; but we are solely concerned with the relation of that scheme to the one which we have proposed, and it is not for us, therefore, to make any recommendation with regard to it, if it is to be maintained as a separate system of superannuation.Persons to whom local Act schemes apply.120. Finally, there is the relation of the new scheme to existing schemes under local Acts to be considered^. The greater number of these are of the general type which we have followed, though the contributions are usually smaller. The pension is in the majority of cases based, as in the scheme we recommend, on the average salary of the last five years of service. Other schemes under local Acts are of the nature of thrift or endowment schemes. The Birmingham Order, 1897, does not authorise the establishment of a fund.The same considerations which, make it desirable that poor-law officers should in future come into the general scheme apply with equal force here. We therefore recommend that all future entrants to the service of local authorities having existing schemes should, if otherwise eligible, be required to join the general scheme. To all existing pensionable officers should be given the opportunity, as we have suggested in the case of the poor-law service, to come into the general scheme. But, inasmuch as it is impossible to lay down the necessarily varying conditions upon which such transfer should take place without a detailed examination of all the different schemes under local Acts, we recommend that each local authority which has
Section XI.-Conclusion.123. We have now completed our inquiry and replied to our reference. It is not to be expected that such a Report as this, embodying not only general principles but also a large number of recommendations on points of detail, should receive in every particular the unanimous approval of all the members of the Committee, and in fact differences of opinion on minor matters have been revealed. But we do not wish to burden the Report with a number of relatively unimportant reservations, and we submit it therefore on the understanding that while we are of one mind, except where otherwise expressed, with regard to the main principles laid down therein, it represents in other respects the opinion of the Committee as a whole rather than the unanimous views of all the signatories. We do not imagine that we have solved all the difficulties which our investigations have revealed. Few people will under-rate the importance of establishing an acceptable and satisfactory scheme of superannuation for the employees of local authorities, and no one who reads our Report, or who prosecutes his own inquiries, is likely to under-rate the difficulty of laying down the lines of such a scheme. It is our hope that we may have succeeded in some measure in indicating both the dangers which are to be avoided and the course which should be pursued in framing legislation.0  9H4Eestablished a superannuation scheme by virtue oi a local Act should submit for the approval of the Central Department the conditions under which existing contributors should be allowed to transfer from the local to the general scheme.The option to transfer should be open for a period of six months from the approval of the conditions by the Central Department, and the rights of those officers who do not exercise the option should remain intact.Repeal of certain enactments.121. We think that, with the exceptions we have indicated, all enactments at present authorising local authorities to grant superannuation allowances should be repealed, save in so^ far as they must be continued for the purpose of providing for present pensioners and for existing pensionable officers who do not come under the new scheme. This will of course be a diminishing class which will finally disappear.Section X.-Gratuities for certain temporary employees.122. Although it lies, perhaps, outside the strict limits of our reference, we think that consideration should be given to the position of certain classes of employees of local authorities-who, although engaged on permanent or continuous work, are described as temporary and the terms of whose employment bring them outside the scope of our scheme. It has been represented to us that many of such employees remain in the service of local authorities for a long period of years although they are not employed in an established capacity, and that their long service gives them a moral claim for consideration at the hands of their employers.In considering the case of such persons regard must be paid to the conditions under which they are employed, They receive the full current rates of pay, and there is no reason on economic grounds why the local authorities should pay more, as they would do, in effect,, if retiring allowances were granted in addition. All such employees benefit by the sickness and other provisions of the National Insurance Acts, and may eventually receive a pension under the Old Age Pensions Acts. Thus, their conditions of service differ in important, respects from those of the established staff of local authorities.It. would, in our opinion, be fatal to the success of the contributory pension scheme which we recommend if provision were made for non-contributory pensions to any of the classes of temporary employees in question, and any consideration given to their claim must be on lines which will not conflict with that scheme.We recognise the validity of the claim for some provision to meet these cases, in the absence of which there is a tendency to retain such persons in the public service when they have partly lost their efficiency. Not a few authorities have obtained powers in their local Acts enabling them to deal with the matter by means of discretionary grants. We are of opinion that it would tend to efficient administration if similar powers were given to local authorities generally.We think that such discretionary grants should take the form of gratuities to meet the needs of special cases where the employee&apos;s service has been long and continuous. Our recommendation is that where an unestablished employee is required to leave the service on account of age, infirmity, or disablement not entitling him to an allowance under the work-men&apos;s Compensation Act, after not less than twenty years of continuous service, the local authority should be empowered to grant out of rates or revenues a gratuity (to be payable in such manner as the local authority may determine) not exceeding in total one week&apos;s pay for each year of service, with a maximum of one year&apos;s pay.

local Authorities in England and wales: report.35-RESERVATIONS BY MR. J. BOGGON.I have signed the Report because believing, as I do, most strongly in the need for a pension scheme for local government officers I think it embodies a scheme which will more-readily than any other receive general acceptance and so the more quickly become effective..But I am at variance with my colleagues on some points of principle, and desire to make the following reservations: (1) I hold that municipal work is simply decentralised national work ; that the days of &quot;parish, pump &quot; politics have passed ; and that the officers of municipalities, who deal with the health, the education, and the general amenities of their respective communities, are performing work no less national in character than that entrusted to the officers of the Government Departments dealing with such matters. The corollary, in my opinion, is that the pension scheme for municipal servants should closely resemble that for civil servants, subject to such a reorganisation of the municipal services as would place them on a level with the civil service both as-regards the character and educational attainments of new entrants,and the general standard of administration. I recognise, however, that this view, with its consequential non-contributory scheme of superannuation, does not receive general support, and I am therefore content to advocate a policy which regards the State as directly interested in the well-being of the municipal services to such an extent as would lead to a State contribution of one-third of the total cost of a pension scheme for those services the remaining two-thirds being met in equal shares by the municipalities and their officers. The Report meets this view to the extent of suggesting that the State should allow all pension charges payable by local authorities in respect of officers directly engaged in the so-called &quot; semi-national &quot; services to rank for purposes of grant on the same basis as other charges in respect of those services. By this means, no doubt, municipalities will be relieved of part of their pension charges from time to time as services administered by them but not now designated &quot; semi-national&quot; pass into that category.(2) There appeared running through most of the evidence given before the Committee a fear that a State contribution would lead to State control and that local govern-ment, if State-controlled, would in effect tend to disappear. I think this fear is much exaggerated; but it undoubtedly obtained not only among the members of local authorities but also among the officers of such authorities who gave evidence before us.(3) Then, finally, I think that there should be a central pension, fund. The actuarial arguments adduced in support &quot;of separate funds for each authority or group of authorities are undoubtedly powerful, and it is difficult for a layman to controvert them ; but my belief, stated shortly, is that&apos; the anomalies which a central fund would cause Avould tend to disappear, and that the simplicity of such a fund and the sense of security which it would give to the local government officers throughout the country outweigh the dangers and disadvantages attaching to it.JOHN BOGGON.E 2

SUMMARY OP PRINCIPAL CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS.1. It is desirable that a uniform scheme of superannuation should be introduced applicable to persons employed by local authorities in England and Wales. (Paragraphs 27-30.) . &apos;2. The scheme should be compulsory upon all local authorities and upon all persons employed by them whole-time in an established capacity, with the exception of the police, teachers pensionable under the School Teachers (Superannuation) Act, 1918, certain firemen, persons employed in asylums and certified institutions, and persons over 55 years of age at the commencement of the scheme.   (Paragraphs 5, 31-33, 71, 107, 112, 113, 118, 119.)3. Temporary employees should be excluded. All part-time established employees in receipt of not less than 501. a year should be included; other part-time established employees should only be included if there is mutual agreement between themselves and their employing authorities for their inclusion. Persons indirectly employed should, with certain exceptions, be excluded.   (Paragraphs 100-107.)4. A State-financed scheme cannot be justified, but local authorities should receive State aid towards superannuation in respect of semi-national services. In such services the cost of superannuation should be included in the expenditure on which the grant is based. (Para-graphs 34-39.)5. The scheme should be contributory, on the basis of half the necessary contributions being found by the authorities and half by the employees. The contributions should be the same for all classes of employees (including women and workmen) and for entrants of all ages. The initial contribution should, be at the rate of five per cent, of the salaries or wages and emoluments from the authorities and five per cent, from the employees. (Paragraphs 40, 41,51-63.) &quot;6. The benefits recommended are set out in paragraph 42, pensions, on the one-sixtieth scale, being based on the average salary received during the last five years of service, with return of contributions in certain eventualities. The pensions should be on the same basis for men and women. There should be no provision for adding years. (Paragraphs 42-45.)  &apos; - - .7. The contributions should be funded. A separate fund for each local authority cannot be recommended. A single central fund is impracticable. A separate fund should be set up in each of the larger towns. The other local authorities in each county should form a joint fund,   (Paragraphs 47-50, 72-91.)8. A contributor leaving the service of one local authority to join that of another should carry a &quot; transfer value &quot; with him and should preserve his pension rights.   (Paragraph 92.)9. The funds should be valued at stated intervals on a basis prescribed by the Government Department concerned, and, if necessary, a consequent adjustment of contributions should be made. Existing contributors at the time of a valuation should not have their rate of contribution altered (unless the benefits are altered), the adjustment being made in the rate payable by the authority. For future entrants the appropriate rate recommended by the Actuary as the result of the valuation should be fixed on the half and half basis. (Paragraphs 59, 93, 94.)10. Local authorities should be authorised, but not^ required, to grant pensions within certain limits to existing employees in respect of back service and in respect of future service rendered by employees who are over 55 years of age at the commencement of the scheme. Such pensions should not be charged upon the superannuation fund, but should be paid out of current rates or revenues.   (Paragraphs 65-71.)11. The School Teachers (Superannuation) Act, 1918, should not be extended to include technical officers in the- educational service with teaching experience. But such officers should be enabled to aggregate years of service recognisable under that Act with subsequent years of pensionable administrative service.. (Paragraphs 108-110.)12. In the event of effect being given to the proposals of the Report of the Local Government Committee of the Ministry of Reconstruction the poor-law service would be merged in that of the county councils and county borough councils, and all new entrants . would come automatically within the scope of our proposals. Existing poor-law officers should have the option to transfer to the new scheme. Teachers in poor-law schools would become the servants of local education authorities, and the School Teachers (Superannuation) Act, 1918, should apply to them as to other teachers in the local education service. (Para-graphs 114-117.) -.....................   ..............-..........-..... 
13. Schemes under local Acts should cease to apply to new entrants, who should come into the general scheme. Existing employees pensionable under local Act schemes should have the option to transfer to the new scheme on terms to be framed by the local authority concerned and approved by the appropriate Government Department. (Paragraphs 120, 121.) &apos; Jl ti14. Local authorities should be empowered to give gratuities to retiring unestablished employees in special cases after not less than 20 years of continuous service.
