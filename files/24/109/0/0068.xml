HAL Y.The minister of Marine,. Senator SEOHI, has made the following announcement in the Senate     The personnel has &quot;been very considerably reduced, though not sufficiently to compromise the efficiency of the service.   Yfaen it roach-os its normal peace footing it will be necessary to stop tho frequent transfer of officers and men from one station to another&quot;: only the alMdg-gun battleships will have full complements, the others will be roamed with reduced orews, whilst only half the scouts, light cruisers, torpedo craft and submarines will be fully manned.   The dreadnou$its will constitute the nucleus of the fleet and round them will be grouped smaller craft for the purpose of frequent exercises. The traininj^ship division wi 11 be reconstituted.   The best possible treatment Is to be accorded to petty officers -also to ooimnLssionod officers, so that the latter are not lured away from the Navy by flattering offers made to them by industrial firms.   Sie reductions in the establishment which remain to be made are designed to leave the Navy in a state of high efficionoy. Definite establishment of officers in the various branches will shortly be issued and arrange-ments will be made that all officers1 careers in the Service will be better assured - at least as far as to enable them to reach the rank of commander.   Promotion will be steady and for all branches.   Only tho bost officers will be allowed to reach the hi$ier ranks.As regards the Naval Dockyards, the Minister is averse to their suppression en masse, although he approves of a logical and considerable reduotion in their number.   At present the civil officials and workmen in the Naval Dockyard cost the State more than the whole Naval personnel does.   The problem is to reduce the Dockyards to a reasonable footing whilst safeguarding the ri&amp;ts acquired by thoir officials and workmen.He affirmed the very great importance of the Air Service and stated that it should havo his most earnest attention - both as regards personnel and materiel.All vessels which do not represent a really useful and efficient element are to be struok off the list.   Nothing could be said at present regarding the construction of new big ships, because, in preparing, for war, it would be necessary to consider what was being done by those countries with whom a conflict might possibly arise.   Another reason for not building capital ships at the moment was the. instabil-Ity of prices and their enormous cost.   However he considered it desirable to set about the preparation of plans for the construction of capital ships, so that if, at no very distant period, it became necessary to commence such construction, everything 7/ould be to hand.   He did not agree with those who held that the day of the big ship was past but it was certainly desirable,le for the present to concentrate on lighter craft.In the discussion that followed Admiral CAGNI gave his opinion that the torpedo-boat was now of practicallyA U S T R I A,The Interallied Naval Commission of&apos; Control for Austria will hold its first meeting at Vienna on July 29th.

The price paid by ROMANIA is said to be  240,000 for each ship, spread over a period of 5 years and to be paid partly in kind.The Rutoanian Government contemplate the appointment of a  naval attache in LONDON, who would be accredited to PARIS also.G R g B 0 B.The Greek officers sent to GRSAIE BRITAIN to undergo (G), (T), (S), and (N) courses have now completed then. The progress made was good and in one or two cases exceptional.&apos; TOTOSP   STATES.In connection with the recent landslide which occurred in tjso PANAMA CANAL, shortly before the -passage of H.M.S. ^RENOWN&quot;, the U.S. Naval Authorities reported, on 16th July, that conditions are now normal.little use and prophesied that a similar fate vrould overtake the submarine before many years elapsed^   It was necessary to have no illusions about, the submarine.   The big gun had always been, and would continue to be, the deciding factor in naval warfare.   Admiral DI RE7EL pointed out that the Navy was to-day able to carry out duties other than purely Naval ones on the occasions of the frequent strikes which, paralysed tho transport services of the country.   For this reason he called for an increase in personnel of 5,000 to bring the figure on a level with the pre-war one.&quot;VAKSSE&quot;, &quot;A. VESPUCCI&quot; and &quot;F. FERPUCIQH were expected to leave LEGHORN on the 15th July for an instructions-tional cruise with Naval Oadots.

He denies having had any nego-tiations with D,A!OTN3I01s Chef de Cabinet and will not un-detake "to  improvise3 a solution of the PIUME question though he intends to aim at one which will promote permanent peace.   There is little authenic news regarding PIUMB-A serious incident occurred at SPALATO on the-11th instant.   So far as can be ascertained the Jugo Slav flag ytb,s insulted by sailors from the &quot;PUGLIA11 and trouble ensued which ended in that ship opening fire on the crowd on shore-   Tie fire was returned, gendarmes taking part, and the Commander of the 1!PUGLIAU was wounded and has since died.

(STT^E^ulyTeisal received a French ultimatum (expiring on 18th July) demanding occupation;by France of, all stations from RYAK to ALEPPO., the unconditional acceptance of French mandate and. the punishment of Arabs who have f ought against France,   The French threatened the strongest action including an advance on Damascus unless these demands were complied with; their troops (numbering about 80,000) were there ready to move at short notice, and rein-forcements   v/ere expected.   On 14th July French troops were reported to have occupied RYAK, on the Junction of the railways from Damascus and Aleppo to BEIRUT, and to have commenced an advance from JERABLUS to Aleppo.Northern Syria and Cilicia.

A similar movement is&quot;reported to have been successful in the other principal cities of the Republic.The President, Sr. Gutierrez Montes, is reported to have resigned and to be leaving for Arica.H.BeMfl Representative reports that no damage has been done to foreign property* and that at present everything is quiet in the Capital.    The causes of the revolution are said to be discontent at the hi$i cost of living, and the illness and weakness of the President.The new regime disclaims any hostility to Chile, but it is nevertheless identified wit^ the claim to ANTOFAGASTA, and is therefore in sympathy with PEHJ.
- 11 CHILE.Serious labour troubles have broken out at IQUIQUE and ANTQEAGASTA, and a general strike is threatened.   No nitrate has been shipped for 5 weeks.In order to guard&apos; against a coup de main on the part of BOLIVIA, and possibly PERU, the OnlleanTovernment is calling up Reserves, and is sending reinforcements to tho frontier.    Some warships are also being sent north.J a P a N.In Trans-Baikal (Siberia) an agreement has been come to between the Japanese, Semenov and the Bolsheviks.0 H IN A.Present disturbances in China merely mark a struggle for power between the An Ju or pro-Japanese party with Tuan chi Jui and Hsu shu Tseng as the chief characters on one hand, and the Chih li party on-the other.Apparently no serious fitting has taken place yet and the Corps diplomatique have notified the Pekin Government that they hope fighting will be avoided in the capital.     Precautionary measures as regards the British troops have been taken.   The Americans have sent 2. light cruisers and six destroyers to Chin wang tao and Pel tai ho*/
2. a Local Housing Bonds. The Housing Bonds-Caiupaign-continues to meot with the most satisfactory response throughout the country. Over 400 looal authorities have now received sanction to issue bonds. It is estimated that the sum of  5,000,000 was subscribed last month and when this total is added to the amount raised by stock and mortgages during the month it will not fall 0, * .0.00,000 rhleh , u W -month for housing purposes.    A steady flow of subscriptions has been reported during the month by those towns In which the campaign Is in full swing.    Bradford has increased its total to  625,000 and Bolton to  500.000.    Ipswich has raised  108,000, and Plymouth  200,000.It is notable that the bulk of the money has been subscribed by private investors, although in certain cases very large contributions have been made by business firms and industrial organisations.    The Boilor Makers Society has subscribed  50,000 at Newcastle and the National Union of Railwaymen has subscribed  50,000 at Derby, intimating that a further sum of similar amount will probably be contributed later.3.     Grants to Private Builders.     It is proposed to extend, the period, within which tho subsidy to private builders will be payable, by one year.   A bill to give effect to this-proposal will be introduced at an early date but It is not-proposed to increase the original sum set asido for this pur-pose ( 15,000,000).    Up to the 25th June, 1920, certificates HAn had &quot;been issued in respect of 11,501 houses involving an approximate grant of  2,778,434.

The total area of these amounts to 17,452 acres and the prices asked by owners or provisionally agreed with the local authorities amounted to  4,540,952 or an average of  260 per acre.    The amount agreed by the Valuers of the Inland Revenue Department was  3,300,156 or an average of  189 per acre, thus showing a saving of  1 40,796 or 27.34 per cent.5*    Unhealthy Areas.    The sub-committee of the Housing Advisory Council which was appointed &quot;to consider and advise on the principles to be followed in dealing with unhealthy areas, in-cluding the circumstances in which schemes of reconstruction, as distinct from clearance, may be adopted, and, as regards cleared areas, the extent to which rehousing on the site should be required, the kind of housing which should be permitted, and the use of the site for factory or other purposes than housing&quot; has presented an   Interim report to the Minister.6^._Supply of Building Materials..    The Minister appointed asma^.1 Committee under the chairmanship of Sir Ernest Moir to con-sider and report on the present position of tjie supplies of builds ing materials, and the arrangements necessary to secure adequate supplios for the Government Housing Programme at reasonable prices. The Committee presented an Interim and a Final Report which are under consideration.    The Interim Report recommended the transfer to the Ministry of Health of the organisation of the Director of Building Materials Supply, and it is hoped that the closer co-operation which will thus be secured will have beneficial results in speeding up the production of houses.7.  l Housing: Schemes,    During the four weeks ending tho 26th Juno, 393 sitos were submitted by local authorities and Public Utility Societies, making a total of 10,535 (exclusive of a number of sites which had been withdrawn or had to be rejected aa un-suitable or for other reasons).
The total area comprised in these sites was over 71,000 acres, which would provide approximately-for^710^000 houses.. The sites approved numberod 6,941   covering over 50,700 acros.    The total number of applications up to the 26th June for approval of lay-outs was 4,995,of which the Ministry had approved 4,409.    tip to the same dato, house plans for 225,088 had been submitted, and of t&amp;oso the Ministry had givon approval for 211,213.
