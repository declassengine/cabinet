THE APPROPRIATION OF THE FUNDS AT,THE DISPOSAL OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMITTEE ON RELIEF CREDITS ITO SITTIHOTN PARIS , , FOR THE REPATRIATION Off PRISONERS OF 7AR*The following ia a short account of the question of the repatriation of prisoners of war who have not yet returned to their home3, so far as it has concerned the League of Nations.On January 7th, the British Foreign Office sent a very strong Memorandum signed by Mr. Gerald Spinor, to the Supreme Economic Council, on the subject of the condition of the Austrian Hungarian and other prisoners of war still in Siberia and other parts of Russia, urging that the condition of these prisoners of war was a desperate one,that oheir repatriation was an immediate necessity, and that their position was one the con-tinuancs of which, if they had been situated in Western Europe, public opinion would r;et. have   tolerated for another month.On February 7th, the British Representatives on the Supreme Economic Council, acting on the Foreign Office Memorandum, brought the matter before the Supreme Economic Council at its Meeting in Paris, and it was decided by the Supreme Economic Council to refer the matter to the next meeting of the Council of the League of Nations with the request that they should taice as rigid action as might be possible.At the Meeting of the Council ox the League held in London on February 18th, the resolution of the Supreme Economic Council was raised by the Italian Representative, and the Council- decided to plsGe ths subject on the Agenda for its next Meeting, in the meanwhile requesting the Secretariat to investigate the matter.     At this Meeting of the Council the British Representative was Mr. Balfour.At its Meeting In Paris on April 10th the Council of the Leaguo appointed Dr. &apos;Hanson to investigate the -problem, i3nd to takwhatever/
v/hateroj^meaBTirea .might bo possible to repatoiMa- the prtponoxs. Among other; points, thevBe&amp;olurtion inciting Dr, Hanaen to act in this capacity included the following words&quot;To investigate, and to report to the Council his &quot;recommendations as to the provision of whatever &apos; : &quot;credit may be required.&quot;The Council further promised Dr.&apos;Nansen every assistance in its power.In the public Report which he made on the matter* the Italian Representative, speaking on behalf of the Council, used the following wordsThe Council is &quot;agreed that the only, way to meet these difficulties is to entrust to a person enjoying world-wide reputation ...... the duty of deciding what is most necessary and urgent for the accomplishment of the task which the league of Nations has undertaken, and of carrying out the measures required, subject to the intervention of the Council should the need arise.&quot;At this Meeting the British Representative was Mr. H.A.L.Hsher.On&apos;May 14th the Council of the league at its Meeting in Rome received the news that Dr. Nansen had accepted their invitatior, and drafted a letter of thanks to him, again expressing their
anxiety to render him any assistance in their power.Before the end of Hay, Dr.Hanson, as a result of the Conferences which he had had with the Governments concerned, tele-graphed to the Secretary-General that he would require immediately a credit for the sum of  670,000, to enable him to carry out a scheme for the repatriation of a large number of prisoners through the Baltic routes.   He further requested the Secretariat of the League to make preliminary investigations on this subjects .Accordingly at the beginning of June, Mr.Lay-ton, the head of the Economic Section of the Secretariat, interviewed in Paris Sir William Goode and Sir John Bradbury as to the possibility of the necessary funds and commodities required for Dr.Nansen&apos;s scheme being furnished from the resources at the disposal of the International Committee on Relief Credits now sitting in Paris. A few days later Mr.Layton also saw Mr.Blackett of the Treasury.On June 8th Sir William Goode as a result of this discussion came to London and &amp;ad a Conference with Dr,Nansen, the Secretary-General and Mrc.Layton, and developed a detailed scheme for the appropriation of the funds of the International Committee on Relief Credits for purposes of repatriation. In accordance with the decisions taken at this Conference, Dr, Nansen telegraphed to the Governments whose prisoners were being repatriated, asking them to apply to the International Relief Credits Committee for the necessary appropriations.   Practically all the borrowing Governments concerned made these applications. Dr.Nansen further telegraphed to the lending Governments repre-sented on the Committee, requesting their assistance.At the Meeting of the Council of the League on June 14th in London, Dr.Nansen further urged the Council to bring pressure
&apos;   i 93to bear on the Governments represented on the international committee, in order to induce these Governments to Instruct theirDelegates on the Committee to agree to Sir William Goode&apos;s scheme^On his suggestion the Council of the League agreed to the follow-ing Resolution^ in accordance with which the Secretary-Genera^wrote a letter to oath of the lending Governments represented onthe International Co;;r..&apos;.:-teo,   The letter to the British Govem-ment was addressed by tiio Secretary-General to-the Prime Minister,and was acknowledged by h:!:ii0p&apos;That a letter be despatched to the Governments &quot;represented on the International Committee of &quot;Relief Credits, urging them to allow the credits &quot;furnished by them to the Committee to be used for &quot;the repatriation of prisoners,&quot;;The British Representative   at the Meeting of the Council at which this Resolution was agreed to was Lord Curzon, who also both in his private and pubUc speeches gave Dr.NanSen encouragement to hope for the assistance of the Governments represented on the Council of the League.Acting on the belief that the Resolution of the Council 7/ould ensure the success of Sir William Goode&apos;s scheme, and also trusting to the assurances of good-will and assistance which he received from several prominent members of the British Government, Dr,Nansen began no other negotiations for the obtaining of money, and held up his appeals to private charity until the question of Government Loans had been settled^On July 2nd - just one month after &quot;Hr,Layton first saw Sir William Gcode and Sir John Bradbury in Paris - tho following telegram was sent to Dr. 5 Nan sen by M:.%C&apos;orvin/; the Secretary of the International Committee on Relief Credits :-
&quot;At Meeting held Wednesday 30 June International &quot;Committee for Relief Credits Chairman stated &quot;British Treasury1s view was that British Relief &quot;credits administered by International Credits &quot;Committee should not be diverted.from original &quot;purpose to be used for repatriation of prisoners. &quot;The French delegate took similar views.   Com-&quot;mittee therefore agreed that delegates of lending &quot;Governments should enter into direct negotiations &quot;with League of Nations and countries requiring &quot;prisoners repatriated for purpose of deciding how &quot;money should be raised and in what proportions&apos;. &quot;International Committee will therefore take no &quot;further action for the present&quot;It is thus clear that Pr.Nansen is no further forward than he was a month ago.   The loss of every day is of the greatest importance to him, as it is absolutely essential that if possible all the prisoners should be repatriated before next winter, as the various Ports from which the prisoners must be repatriated - Vladivostok, Narva, Bjbrko - freeze up about the end of October.   As there are half-a-miliion prisoners in question, the urgency of the matter is evident.It is now submitted that unless Dr.Nansen is to be placed in a very false position, the British Government should either instruct their Delegate on the International Committee on Relief Credits to reverse his attitude, and to induce the French Delegate to do the same, or they should instruct him to place a similar sum to that which they would have 4 located from the Relief Credits, to the use of Dr.Nansen.2nd July 1920.
