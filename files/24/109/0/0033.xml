The 7th was generally observed as a day of mourningj flags, when hoisted, being flown at half-mast by the &quot;Maltese.   J The stoppage of leave to HJOorcos is reported to have been unpopular amongst the tradespeople, owing to the&apos; loss of custom consequent upon this measure.

Littledale, Naval Adviser to the Esthonian Government, for 2 destroyers, ki submarines and 4 sloops, also that supplies of stores, munitions and fuel be guaranteed to Esthonia. This request is being held up pending reviewal of.Admiralty policy with regard to the formation&quot;of naval police forces by the Baltic States.The 3.N.O., Baltic considers it desirable to&apos; show the flag at Riga and requests permission to send, a destroyer there.    This has been approved.      &apos;mm, vmmh.Press reports that a Russian warship, flying the former Russian flag, has arrived at Kiol,    Permission to proceed was refused when it was ascertained that she intended to proceed to tho Black Sea to support General Wrangel.Note.-   &apos;This is probably &quot;KITOBOI&quot; which left Copenhagen on 7th July.

The Foreign Office state that they are averse to any Officers what so-ever remaining in the Crimea, but both the Admiralty and War Office have decided that it is most essential that Naval and Military Intelligence Centres should be maintained.HoMoShips &quot;CONCORD&quot; and &quot;SHARK&quot; are at Sevastopol and &quot;TOMAHAWK&quot; at&apos; Theodosia.H.M,Ships &quot;EMP.3ROR OF INDIA&quot;, &quot;AJAX&quot;, &quot;SENATOR&quot; and &quot;SWALLOW&quot; were at Batourh on 9th July,&apos;It has been reported by a Prisoner who has escaped from Baku that British Naval Personnel are thought to be imprisoned on Wolf Island.Repatriation,   The s.s.&quot;0ZAR&quot; with 31 Russian deportees from England and 1500 Russians from Belgium have been ordered to proceed to Copenhagen there to await orders,    a Destroyer escort is&quot;to be provided from Han go to Copenhagen, .   4S IB.&amp;RIA a press reports that the Russian Consul General at Shanghai, aided by police, has seized three Volunteer steamers and forcibly a hundred&quot;recalcitrant seamen.

Beforo making, any&quot; final decision as to the general adopt-ion of boats of this class, the naval authorities are&quot;awaiting the arrival in Denmark of two Italian craft built for somewhat similar purposes.The Danish ship &quot;FiLLA&quot;, ex &quot;ASPHODEL&quot;\ sailed from Harwich on 5&apos;th July an- arrived, at Copenhagen on 9th July.

Bases and Schools of Instruction, assenu existingt will either be suppressed or removed to other localities better suited to modern retirements or training.a Hydrographic Establishment will be built on the same promontory as the Cadets&apos; School.The Dockyard of Salamis, the only one worthy of consideration, is still suffering acutely from the results of the two years French occupation during the late war; much machinery was removed to France, and has neither been returned nor replaced.    All docking has still to be done at the Piraous in the commercial docks, but all repairs to T.B.D&apos;s coming under the head of &quot;annual refit&quot; can be carried out at Salamis, including re-tubing, engine castings, and repairs to propellors.    Re-boilering would, have to be carried out abroad, or new boilers sent to Salamis from England.    Repairs and light castings for small light cruisers could also be carried out. The whole establishment, in spite of dislocation aftes the French occupation, appeared, from a short day&apos;s visit, to be inspired by a high moral  and the men worked with a good will which it was a pleasure to see in these days.    It will be brought as much up-to-date as possible, and will Be used ciS an auxiliary establishment to the new lard which is to be constructed at Eleusis Bay, on the mainland.Personnel.    From all outward appearances, such as the smart manner in which the men always salute passing officers, the way in&apos;which the latter punctiliously return the salute, the smart appearance of bptb/ officers- and men, especially the cadets, and other signs by which sue may gauge the morale of a service, the morale of the Greek Navy was;--good.    One point that cannot fail to strike the stranger is, that in conversation with the majority of soldiers and others of the     V&apos; population, the absorbing interest appears to be politics:- i,e. Venizelist or Royalist, with the Navy it is their profession which seems to interest them most.     The British Naval Mission seems to  -be very popular, and there is no doubt the Greeks are very anxious to have an efficient and up-to-date Navy.Materiel,     After having been two years manned by the French, the wear andje^ar of.,practically 6  years under war conditions, and with
very limited opportunities for refitting, the ships themselves are now reduced to a woeful condition of inefficiency,.   The two ex-American battleships &quot;LEMNOS&quot; and hKILKIS,t. and three old coast i, defence ships of the - l!H&apos;.YTJriAv&apos; class are worn out and completely. out &quot; of date, with speeds considerably reduced, none of them&quot;worth refitting.   -With the exception of the &quot;(UVEBOFF, the 4 &apos;i.B.D&apos;s of the &quot;LEON&quot; class, the 2 T,B*D!s of the -&quot;NBA GENEA&quot; class, and the small cruiser &quot;HELLE&quot;,.. the remainder if the Navy is only fit to be sold or broken up.    The four T,,B,D&apos;S of the &quot;?&apos;ANTHEBM class, good &apos; for 30 knots when taken over by the French, have had their soeed reduced to about ZZ knots b\ the French having removed the British boilers and replaced them by small French boilers.      They will have to be sent to England for re-boilering if they are to be restored to any fighting value,TUI^XThe Italian Light Cruiser &quot;1L BIXIO&quot; and Z T.B,Dfs are reported at Scala Nuova and Z Greek &apos;i\B*Dfs at Bamos*Minor incident is concerned with the seizure by the Greeks of the Turkish ships &quot;HI Ixi:RjiIS&quot; (gunboat) and McLo No.14*    These vessels were stationed at Smyrna &quot;by C-in-C, Mediterranean, for the suppression of piracy and haa no Allied personnel on board,    The Greeks seized them on the pretext that they were about to attack Greek ships (this is considered unlikely) ana now claim to be guarding them on behalf of the Allies,The French authorities .-consider that the Greeks should be ordered to release them,British forces, including a detachment of Marines, landed and occupied Lapsaki without incident.On 6th July Mudania and Gemlik were occupied by Naval forces.

Germany. Wage demands are becoming unbearable and there,is considerable unemploy-ment.&apos; Outbreaks may occur and he.emphasised the importance.of the retention of ^00,000 men in the Reichswehr at least temporarily, for the purposes of maintaining larder, He maintained that it was important that the Chancellor should return from Spa with something on the credit side to show, otherwise the Government might fall and be replaced by a radical government, which might degenerate into a Soviet Dictatorship.The protocol signed on 9th July by the Allies and Germany on military&quot;matters reads as follows:-On condition that Germany,-A.

In doing so they came into&quot;contact with Italian forces at Arvalia, were ordered by the Italian colonel to retire and refused. A collision ensued in which the Italians, who were supported by the fire of a destroyer, were repulsed by a bayonet charge. One Italian was killed and one Lieutenant and 2 woundedi captured.     These prisoners were returned and telegraphing on the 7th inst. our representative at Smyrna hoped the incident would be settled by the Greeks making a formal request to occupy  the positions in question, which the Italians would grant.

The  reel C.O.S. considered the regiment at CKANAK no longer necessary and suggested concern-trating the whole  1vision at DEDEAGATCH.General PARASKEVOP0UL0S having been given a free hand to carry out the occupation of E. THRACE at the most suitable moment considered the present time opportune.Greek G.H.Q. accordingly changed its plan of operations and wished to clear up TERACB by&quot;a rapid operation with 3 divisions, being of the opinion that this operation, would require at most a fortnight.   Two divisions would then return to ASIA IvIIfiOR, making 8 divisions available for further action against KUSTAPHA KEl&amp;L.COURSE OF OPERATIONS1.1.JB0U     *ffieGreeks captured EDRSOTD and o/dmmencafl a move on BALOl!J&apos;ifc&apos;p;jA,S*.7v20*      Th^ Greeks occupied and advancing along the railway eft ect&amp;c!.; a function with the main forces.

COUSMSIKOPLE and IS^TI) were reported, quiet and there was no news from C\HAJfAK and THRAGE,The Nationalists offered to return the prisoners captured during the ISMxD fighting.4*7.30.      Greek proposals for a continuance of the offensive were as follows:-   to occupy BRUSA and subsequently advance on ESOSHEHH and A&quot;IIJM EAPA3IBSAR. . With these places in his hands General PABASKE)I0P0uT.OS considered one division would be sufficient to occupy ANGORA and the whole Nationalist movement  . would then dissolve.General BRIDGES commenting on these proposals emphasised tho excellent conduct of the Greek troops as a result of ifshich and of the ability with which the political situation had been handled the Turks were in a receptive mood and were combining with the Crooks for the maintenance of order. He pointed out, however., that the Greek Army cannot remain in the field indefinitely and that a gendarmerie under foreign officers and some form of allied machinery for inspection will be necessary to replace it.The Nationalists evacuated 3&quot; 1KB (3. of CllANAK) A Nationalist bend some 500 strong raided BERIC08, on the Asiatic shore of the BOSPORUS, in search of loot and supplies, but were eventually driven off after being engaged by a Greek and an Indian battalion.

OIZBLOS, General PARASEEVOPOULOS proposed to land at RODOSTO shortly and to occupy 33. THRACE,General PARASiCEVOPOULOS asked for the co-operation of British men-of-war in the landing at R0DOST0,Our High Commissioner considered the proposal of Mo VENIZELOS most rash and ill-advised, the situation in ASIA MINOR not being clear and operations there being still in progress. Only, a small part, relatively, of ASIA MINOR has been occupied, the further action of MUSTAPIIA IQ3MAL cannot be foreseen, nor is it known what further forces he can dispose of or if the Turkish population will remain quiet under Greek occupation. Any set back suffered by the Greeks would have a most serious effect and a reduction of Greek forces in ASIA MINOR is there-fore unwise.The High Commissioner further feared that this plan may have been proposed to M. YBNI2SL0S by the French military authorities, with the hope that the Greeks, to whom we alone are lending support, may overreach, themselves and. a situation arise which the French could turn to their advantage at CONSTANTINOPLE and which would detract from our present pre-dominant position there,9.7.30. CONSTANTINOPLE and CHAN ATI quiet,tNo news from THRACE.Slight enemy activity at ISMID.A R M E HI A.M. KATI3SIAN left CONSTANTINOPLE for PARIS on the 3rd July, after expressing to our High Commissioner-his deep gratitude for the British help accorded.to ARMENIA.He mentioned that ARMENIA had received 2,500 rifles and bayonets, iiut no cartridges.At present the Armenian army possesses 3,000 Russian&apos; rifles, but only 1,000.000 cartridges, while General WRANGEL has plenty of cartridges to spare but wants commodities which ARMENIA can supply, only transport is lacking.He suggests, that&quot; contemporaneously with the Greek, advance in ASIA&quot;MINOR the Armenians should -undertake an ad- -vance towards ALASHGIRD as a means of establishing their claim to the territory the Treaty allots - thorn.   .
Armenian regular forces, some 5000 strong, were reported to &quot;be attacking a Turco-Tartar force of roughly equal strength and under the command of JAWAD BEY, 7 miles S.W. of I3HIVA1I.In this aroa the Armenian population appears to have sided with the Bolsheviks, though EHIYAIf itself has not done so. Tho Armenians claim (7.7.20) further successes in the Olti area.UKIEI) STATES.On 5th July, the National Convention at San Francisco elected Governor Cox, of Ohio, as the Democratic Candidate for the Presidency.   This nomination did not take place until the 44-th ballot and terminated one of the longest drawneout convention battles in a Quarter of a century.   The campaign was won by the solid and dogged support received from Tammany.Mr. MoAdoo, President Wilsonfs Son-in-law, and Attorney General Palmer were his two principal opponents.United States are now making definite arrangements to erect defences on Tobago Island.   They are entitled by the Treaty of 1904 to acquire any island or land considered necessary for the defence of the Canal, but when Panama Government was approached in.November, 1918, they made such protest that It was agreed to drop the matter until after signing of the Treaty of Versailles..Serious anti-American demonstrations have lately taken place when it was known that U.S.A. were moving again in the matter.J A P A jjf   &apos;The recent General Elections in Japan gave the Sei-yu-kai (The Government party) an absolute majority of 96.
