This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government. SECRET.Referred to Committee of Home AffairsTHE CABINET.PREVENTION OF FRAUD (GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS)  ^-BILL. 5452MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.I circulate for the approval of the Cabinet a draft Bill embodying in a statutory form the provisions of Regulation 45 (1) (h) of the Defence of the Realm Regulations.This Regulation provides that a person will be guilty of an offence who makes any statement, or does any act, intended or calculated to mislead or deceive any person in the employment of the Government as to the quantity or quality of any war material or other goods, or otherwise in relation to the manufacture, testing or supply thereof, or with the like intent withholds any information in his possession. This particular Regulation was found extremely useful during the War, and there have been a number of instances of successful prosecution. These offences were of a character highly dangerous to the lives of numbers of His Majesty s Forces ; for example, the insertion of faulty parts into aeroplanes. Prior to the Regulation being brought into operation, no adequate safeguards existed against fraudulent action on the part of contractors or - their employees in deceiving Government Inspectors as to the quality of stores produced. The Bill, as drafted, provides also against fraud in connection with services rendered.The continuance of this Regulation by the War Emergency Laws (Continuance) Act was secured with a view to the subject being dealt with by permanent legislation. It may be added that Mr. Guy Stephenson, the Assistant Director of Public Prosecutions, who has had much experience of&apos;the difficulty of successfully instituting criminal proceedings in cases, now covered by Regulation 45 (1) (A), which arose before the War, strongly recommends that the Regulation should be kept alive in the form of permanent legislation, and it is at his suggestion that the present Bill has been drawn to apply to any goods and not merely, like the Regulation, to war material.W S 0The Wae Office, , &apos;  &apos;23rd July, 1920.i(B20/264)   100  7/20  HAS  8275wo
