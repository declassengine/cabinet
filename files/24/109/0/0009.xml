(THlfe DOCmCTT . IS THE -PROPERTY OF HIS BRITAHFIC MAJE&apos; TYf S GOVERNMENT). CGfiFEDENTIAL. CABINET0.1608. (A.J.210)EXECUTION OP TREATY OP PEACE WITH GERMANY,SUGGESTIONS FOR THE EXECUTION OF THE RECONSTRUCTIONOP THE DEVASTATED AREAS.Presented&apos; by the. German Delegation at Spa,, \    a.   &apos;The reconstruction of the areas which were destroyed in the war forms an interest which is common to all nations as the danger exists that the feelings of hatred and the desire for revenge will not cease until such reconstruction has been carried out.    The German Government has therefore, although according to the Treaty of Peace Germany was not obliged to participate directly in reconstruction, declared its readiness immediately after the signature of the Treaty to participate in the work of reconstruction.&apos;    Germany urgently recommends in the common interest that this question should again be approached. In connection herewith Germany also takes into consideration the observation which she has made in the course of the deliveries so far made for the purposes of reconstruction, that the materials delivered are not exclusively used to place the destroyed areas in the same condition in which they were formerly, but are also partially used by those who have suffered damage to create a fresh existence for themselves in other places.- B, .(( l The German Government, therefore, makes the proposal*  t at the reconstruction of the- devastated areas should be. \:&apos;   undertaken by means of a great international colonisation scheme.    This scheme is outlined as follows:-(1)   An International Syndicate of Contractors is to be formed, the participation in which is open to all j &apos; States/
States.SPA,July 11th 1920.p        (2)   It would be the duty of this Syndicate to carry outthe cleaning up of. the devastated areas in conjunction with the G-governments which are directly interested; -further to reconstruct industry, agriculture, roads., railways,-and other means of transport, and to erect new homes for the former inhabitants of these areas or for colonists who may go there from other parts of the countries which have suffered damage.(3) The Syndicate will invite Contractors and workmen from the Allied and Associated Powers, as well as from Germany to participate in this work.(4)   This colonisation and reconstruction is to be carried out on business and not on bureaucratic lines, and is to be run in such a manner that no undue profits are - made out of it;(5)   All organisations connected with it are to be built up on the principle of a proportional share in the work by employers and employed.C.If this scheme is agreed to in principle a Conference should at.once take place as to its practical execution, such Conference to be attended by representatives of the Governments of those countries which wish to participate in the Syndicate, by representatives of the population of the devastated areas and by representatives of the employers and of the employed.
