It may be convenient to my colleagues to see all the telegrams which have1 passed between the Government of India and myself regarding the withdrawal of the force from Meshed since the definite order to withdraw was given on 5th May. It is irrelevant to pursue the enquiry (as the Viceroy does in his private telegram of 13th July) back to February, but in justice to the Government of India I have prefixed five telegrams of April, which will show sufficiently that there was no desire on.their part to delay withdrawal. I hope the whole collection will satisfy the Cabinet that the Government of India have at no stage been indifferent to&apos; their orders. I may add that my military adviser here (Lieut.-Gen. Sir H. V. Cox, K.C..B.) thinks that His Majesty&apos;s Government are greatly underrating the physical difficulty of the operation of withdrawal if they consider that the preparations for it have been unduly protracted. If there is any further doubt dn the subject, I suggest a reference to the Imperial General Staff.E. S. M.. 17th July 1920.,  i &apos;Extract from telegram from Viceroy, Foreign Department, to Secretary of State for India, dated 31st March 1920.   (Received 1st April.)559 S. Instructions issued by the Governor-General of Khorasan that large Bolshevik forces should be met by protest only seem to go beyond the views of the Persian Government expressed in Cox&apos;s telegram No. 15 of 26th March, that shall the Bolsheviks intrude or attack, the Persians will defend themselves.Our military officers in Khorasan consider that the instructions make the position of our troops in advanced posts near the frontier very difficult. We agree in this view as it gives the Bolsheviks opportunity to maintain that the Persians are in their favour, and the British the only hostile element, and furnishes them with excuse for attacking our troops. Considering, however, doubt as to the Bolsheviks&apos; intentions, we incline to think that until His Majesty&apos;s Government make definite announcement of military policy in respect of East Persia, our best course is to instruct Malleson to hold on and bluff so long as this is compatible with the safety of the troops. Military authorities agree.   Please confirm by clear line.Extract from telegram from Viceroy, Army Department, to Secretary of State forIndia, dated 1st April Iy20.   (Received 4th.)4209.&apos; 1st April.In our telegram No. 3721, dated 19th March, we suggested that official denial of-any aggressive intentions on our part, coupled with withdrawal of bulk of Malleson&apos;s force from Meshed, might serve&apos;to allay Bolshevik suspicions and so arrest their activities on Khorasan border.Information which has since reached us emphasises in our opinion desirability of adopting some such measure, irrespective of decision regarding withdrawal from Meshed.3. This has become of special importance in view of recent message from Governor-General of Khorasan to his subordinate at Daraguz, which is referred to in our Foreign Department telegram No. 559 S. of 31st March (corrupt group), this message gives us valuable insight of Persian attitude towards possible Bolshevik aggression, but adds much to difficulties of Mallesons position. If message accurately represents views of Persian Government we become committed to quixotic policy of supporting Government which is not prepared to support itself, and in our opinion this alone would justify our withdrawal from East Persia. But apart from this, 10   1917     100  7.20 A
Telegram from Secretary of State for India to Viceroy, Army Department,dated Uh April 1920. &apos;1238. Your Foreign Department telegram of 31st March, 559 S. I confirm your proposed instructions to Malleson. He should, of course, do nothing that will make withdrawal more difficult. It is hoped that final orders will issue shortly on general question and on your telegram 4209 of 1st April.Telegram from Secretary of State for India to Viceroy, Army Department,dated 26th April 1920.1474. Your telegram of 1st April, 4209. Definite orders as to withdrawal of East Persian Force maybe delayed. In the meantime while&apos;General Officer Com-manding should continue to maintain attitude of bluff, suggested in your Foreign Department telegram of 31st March, it is most desirable to avoid possible entangle-ments indicated in your Army Department telegram of 1st April. Question of withdrawal or otherwise of his outposts is a matter which should be left to his discretion, as he is better situated to appreciate local situation and probable results of such action.Telegram from Viceroy, Army Department, to Secretary of State for India,dated 1st May 1920.   (Received 3rd.)5494. 1st May. East Persia. Please refer to your telegram of 26th April, No. 1474. Owing to high rate of wastage among camels in East Persia, particularly on section Duzdap-Neh, maintenance of force is becoming increasingly difficult and threatens in near future to become impossible unless we draw upon our Indian frontier reserves, which, in present situation, would be most inadvisable. We are therefore compelled to press for as early a decision as possible as to when withdrawal is likely to take place, and to emphasise once more that if the force is retained in any strength the construction of Duzdap railway section will be essential. In the event of the force being retained for any length of time the extension will, moreover, be far more economical than camel transport. Alternative of employing motor transport has been exhaustively examined and tested, but has been abandoned as impracticable.Telegram from Secretary of State for India to Viceroy, Army Department,dated 5th May 1920.1651. Your telegram of 1st May, 5494. Force at Meshed is to be withdrawn forthwith, only consular escorts being retained, one and half cavalry squadrons at Meshed and half a squadron at Seistan with some light armoured cars and possibly Ford van transport at Meshed. Small regular mobile detachment to be kept at Duzdap, and reduced garrison at Kwash. Khorasan and Seistan levies will be taken over by Persian. Strong objection by His Majesty&apos;s Government has been taken to the estimate of five months in which to effect withdrawal from Meshed, and 1 request that every effort be made to carry it out in less time, and that it be expedited to greatest possible extent. Please telegraph, after consideration, your revised estimate of quickest withdrawal possible. I will address you again regarding incidence of expenditure.neutrality of frontier officials in event of attack would seriously compromise position of our frontier detachments, who have hitherto relied on moral, if not active, support of local authorities. It is for consideration whether in these circumstances detachments should not be withdrawn to Meshed without delay.4. As general conclusion we anticipate that the longer Malleson force remains in Khorasan, the more embarrassing is its position likely to become. Retention of force is, however, foreshadowed in Foreign Office telegram to Teheran No. 153, of 23rd March, and this being so we consider everything possible should be done to remove cause of Bolshevik suspicion of our motives and so prevent military collision on frontier. In our opinion public declaration of our policy denying absolutely all aggressive intentions would do much to clear situation, as this at present threatens at any moment to develop to our disadvantage.
Telegram from Viceroy, Army Department, to Secretary of Stale for India, dated Vdtli May 1920.   (Received 14th May.)6066. 13th May. Reference to telegram No. nil, dated 5th May. The present is by far the most difficult time of year in which to cany put the withdrawal of troops from East Persia owing to lack of water and to hot-wind of 120 days which is due to begin about end of May and renders all movement extremely arduous south of Nelii It may be possible to reduce estimate of five months, but for reasons given above no such guarantee can be given.   Withdrawal has been ordered to begin at once.Telegram from Viceroy, Army Department, to Secretary of State for India,dated 29th May 1920.   (Received 31st.)6787. A large quantity of stores, comprising small arms ammunition, equipment, clothing, tentage, medical stores, engineer stores, and veterinary stores, are on East Persian lines of communication.Estimated weight of stores, exclusive of amounts actually accompanying troops, as follows: Meshed 10,000 maunds. On the line Meshed exclusive of Birjand, inclusive of 10,500 maunds. On the line Birjand exclusive of, railhead exclusive of, 9,500 maunds.Estimated cost of transport from Meshed to railhead works out to 4-1 pounds ^sterling per mannd. We suggest for your consideration that it would be to advantage of His Majesty&apos;s Government and of Persian Government if latter were to take over such stores as may be required for (? uniform) of force[from surpluses north of Birjand at a price to be fixed between War Office and Persian Government. We could afford to (? write) down prices very low to tempt Persian Government rather than be compelled to sell or destroy. Further, the supply of camels to remove stores will be severe drain on civil resources. In anticipation of some such arrangement we are notifying Dickson description of stores, quantities, and present (? locations).Telegram from Viceroy, Foreign and Political Department, to Secretary of State for India, dated 2nd June 1920.   (Received 3rd June.)679 S. Reference Minister at Teheran&apos;s telegram 301 of 23rd May. Owing to -difficulties as regards water, first actual (corrupt group) movement of troops from Meshed cannot begin until early in&apos; July. By the time that Bolsheviks on Enzeii front become aware that withdrawal from Meshed is in progress, Enzeii situation may have been satisfactorily settled. On the other hand, if after another month Enzeii situation has become increasingly serious, this in our opinion will of itself constitute additional and weighty reason, for withdrawal, of Meshed force with least possible delay before it becomes involved locally. The smallness of Meshed force and the length and vulnerability of lines of communication render it a tempting bait to Afghan -aggression, and its maintenance is draining us dry of transport which may be urgently required elsewhere and cannot be replaced from India.We are therefore reluctantly compelled strongly to oppose Cox&apos;s suggestion to retain force at Meshed for even a day after commencement&apos; of withdrawal becomes practicable.Telegram from Viceroy, Army Departments to Secretary of State for India, dated 2nd June 1920.   (Received 3rd June.)6917. Your telegram No. nil of 5th May re withdrawal of Meshed force. We presume that mission and consular escort at Meshed will be maintained from Tehran after force has been withdrawn, as was case in pre-war days.Alternative line of maintenance from Duzdap is so unreliable that we deprecate its use, and we could not undertake maintenance of escort unless road is kept in constant state of repair, is adequately protected and posts provided at regular intervals for protection of convoys en route. We propose, moreover, that ultimately the escort at Meshed should be found from the Indian troops which we furnish for the post-war garrison in Mesopotamia.We will arrange to furnish and maintain consular escort in Seistan.Arrangements for withdrawal are in progress, but no move can take place until water arrangements are complete.   You will be kept acquainted with situation.
Telegram from Foreign Office to Sir P. Cox (Teheran), dated 9th June 1920.Urgent. Government of India wish, to offer Persian Government surplus stores north of Birjand on withdrawal of Eastern Forces. General Dickson has been given description and particulars.The question will be fully considered here after arrival of Moens, but in mean-time please telegraph your views.Telegram from Viceroy, Army Department, to Secretary of Stale for India, dated 1st July 1920.   (Received 5th July.)*8285.   We notice that His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Minister, Tehran, in his telegrams 392 and 394, dated 18th June 1920, addressed to Foreign Office, London, strongly urges that the force at Meshed should not be withdrawn, it being stated in latter-telegram that such a withdrawal would be regarded as a breach of faith.There would not appear to be any question of breach of faith in such a with-drawal, and although there are.undoubtedly arguments which can be put forward for the retention of this detachment, the arguments against such a course seem to us to-be far stronger.The Meshed detachment was originally sent there to support the volunteer army and to act as an observing force of events in Transcaspia. It has been emphasised by His Majesty&apos;s Government on several occasions that the role of this force was to be merely one of bluff, and its orders are that if attacked in force it is to retire. This policy of bluff was not successful at Enzeli. There the detachment was able to retire on its supports without difficulty, and no serious results ensued except a certain loss of prestige. The position at Meshed is different. There the small detachment is in the air, depending for its existence on a line of communication 000 miles long, the whole of which is very vulnerable to attack from Afghanistan. If this detachment were attacked by Bolsheviks, and especially at a time when the attitude of Afghanistan appeared to be hostile, the situation would be almost certain to lead to a disaster, the results of which it would be hard to foresee, and which would be much more damaging to our position in the East than any possible loss of prestige or of Persian morale that may result from a withdrawal at the present juncture.In our opinion the present time is particularly suitable for a withdrawal from Meshed, in view of our present relations with Afghanistan, which have much improved in last few weeks past, and also owing to the fact that the Bolsheviks in Transcaspia, are fully occupied with their own internal troubles, which, if the whole truth were known, are more formidable than cur own. The &apos; question of expense must also not be forgotten. You are aware of the excessive cost of this detachment, and, if any of your future money is to be made available for the assistance of Persia, it would be better spent in reorganising the finances and armed forces of - Persia than in main-taining a dangerous and expensive detachment at Meshed. In conclusion, we would again point out that supply of transport for the line of communication from Buzdap to Meshed is draining India dry of camels which may be required elsewhere, and which at present it is impossible to replace.In view of the above, we trust no change in the policy of withdrawal from Meshed will be made.Telegram from Viceroy, Army Department, dated 2nd July 1920. - - (Received 2 p.m.)Priority A. 8375. Reference our telegram No. . 6787, dated 29th&apos;May, and reminder thereto, No.&apos; 7769, dated 19th June. Had arranged to commence withdrawal on 1st July, but have now to postpone it owing to non-receipt of reply to our No. 6787. Please state when reply may be expected to enable Zero day to be fixed. Delay adds to cost and difficulties of withdrawal, as it necessitates sending up further-quantities of supplies.Telegram from Secretary of State, for India to Viceroy, Army Department,dated oik July 1920.2331. Your telegram of 2nd July,&quot;No. 8375. Foreign Office have telegraphed to Tehran regarding disposal of stores to Persia. In meantime is it not possible to-begin the withdrawal from Meshed ? On what do you base estimate of five months ? His Majesty&apos;s Government are most anxious withdrawal should not be delayed, and
that period of five months should by all possible means be reduced, as the expense involved is very great, and the military commitment undesirable. They rely on you to spare no effort to that end.Telegram to Mr. Norman (Teheran), dated 7th July 1920.   (Received 8th July). (Addressed to Foreign Office.   Sent to India.   Copy to Baghdad and Kasvin.) No. 470.   Very urgent.Your telegram No. 359. If, in spite of my earnest protests (see especially my telegram. No. 458), which I take this opportunity of repeating, decision immediately to withdraw this force is maintained, stores in question had better be taken back to India, as no use can be made of tSein by Persian Government in Eastern Persia at this moment.If, however, withdrawal is postponed, as it is essential that it should be, the possibility of utilisation of these stores by Persian Government should be reconsidered here prior to such withdrawal. (?By that time) question of raising Persian forces in Eastern Persia will be ripe for decision.I would add, on authority of Financial Adviser, that loss of Khorassan to Persia, which is almost certain to follow withdrawal of force, would make it impossible to carry out scheme of financial reform which must come into force if country is to continue to exist as an organised State.Telegram from Viceroy, Army Department, to Secretary of State for India, dated 7th July 1920.   (Received 7th July.)8501.   6th July.   Meshed telegram dated 2nd July : &quot;The Governor-General received a message yesterday from the Acting Persian Consul, Askabad, to the effect that Soviet Military Committee, Askabad, had sent a letter on 30th June to their Headquarters, and showed him a letter dated 30th June, No. 272 S, signed by Baronov Zinoviev, a precis of which is as follows:-&quot; &apos; Our F.O. on 26th March and again on 15th June expressed a desire that the British, who had established a post in Bajgiran Frontier towards our (Russian) territory, should withdraw that post. Although three months have passed since our General issued first communication, no reply has been received by Moscow, and the English have not only not abandoned a post-but have daily added to their guns there. As such developments cannot be tolerated by our Military Department, we request you, for the third time, to take serious and prompt action to remove British post &quot; lying in Russian soil.&quot; We will await a reply up to 12 p.m. on Sundav, 4th July 1920.&apos; .&quot; 2. It seems first two communications were not received by Governor-General. He has been instructed to inform Bolsheviks accordingly and further that, as far as is known, no British are on Russian soil in the neighbourhood of Bajgiran, but that orders have been sent to Frontier by the British commander for immediate withdrawal should such be the case.&quot; 3. I believe all our troops are on Persia&apos;s soil. I have, however, instructed the Officer Commanding troops, Bajgiran, to verify this and report, but to automatically withdraw our troops immediately if on Russian soil.&quot; 4. As the present message seems of a provocative nature, I propose to resist at once any attempt of the Bolsheviks to turn us out until compelled by superior force to withdraw.5. A movable column, consisting of one squadron, one section mountain guns, one section field ambulance, under the command of Macrae, 124th Baluchis, left Meshed this morning for Kuchan, as a precautionary measure, and to support, if necessary, the withdrawal of detachments towards Meshed.&quot;Meshed telegram of 3rd July :  &quot;It is reported by Bajgiran that one of our posts, which was found to be on Russian soil, has been withdrawn to a distance of 120 yards and re-established on Persian territory.&quot; I am requesting Governor-General, through the Consul-General, to inform Bolsheviks, and to express regret at our having unknowingly established our original post within Russian territory.&quot;Above two telegrams repeated Kazvin, Baghdad, and Constantinople. 1917 B
Telegram from Viceroy, Army Department, to Secretary of State for India, dated 8th July 1920.   (Received 9th July.)8672.  6th July.   In reply to your telegram dated 5th July, No. 2331.Estimate of five months was based on number of men and horses that can travel from post to post at one time owing, to water difficulties, and also included a montlYs notice. The urgency oE a rapid withdrawal has been impressed upon all concerned, and no effort will be spared to make it as rapid as possible. We hope to complete in less than four months from zero day. Everything is ready for commencement of withdrawal, and zero day will nuw be fixed and notified to you shortly. We have been awaiting reply to our question regarding disposal of stores, as considerable loss of money may be involved if withdrawal were commenced without definite orders having been issued as regards their disposal. In view of your telegram quoted above we shall now, however, order withdrawal to commence, and will make the best arrangements we can for disposal of stores. Pending reply from Tehran to telegram sent by Foreign Office, we propose to collect at Meshed bulk of stores now at Birjand and northwards for subsequent disposal as may be arranged by you.Telegram from Secretary of State for India to Viceroy, dated. 9th&apos;July 1920.Private. My official telegram No. 2331, of 5th July, regarding withdrawal from Meshed, crossed your Army Department telegram No. 8285, of 1st July, and will, I hope, have made position clear. But I cannot help being surprised that Army Department should so completely have misunderstood position as to think retention of force possible. Peremptory orders to withdraw at once were sent in my telegram No. 1651 of 5th May, and the delay in beginning withdrawal is constantly cast in my teeth by the Cabinet, some members of which, I am sorry to say, are inclined to attribute it to indifference on part of your Government, on whom the expense does not fall. Your Army Department No. 8501, of 6th July, will increase their displeasure, for it shows that there is risk of entanglements which may make withdrawal more difficult, and withdrawal must now seem to be. clue to IBolshevik threats. I can understand that difficulties about water and necessity for disposing of stores may have delayed withdrawal of main force from Meshed itself, but I am at a loss to understand why there are still detachments on Russian frontier two months after orders were given. I beg you to give this matter your personal attention, and to insist that such further orders are sent to General Officer Commanding, Meshed,, as will leave him in no doubt that withdrawal is to be begun and continued as quickly as possible, that nothing is done to hinder it, and that no detachments are to be kept in neighbourhood of frontier a moment longer than absolutely necessary.Telegram from Viceroy to Secretary of State for India, dated&apos; IWi July 1920.Private. Your private telegram,of the 9th instant, I have gone into this case most carefully, and I forward you its full history. In view of your suggestion that members of His Majesty&apos;s Government attributed the delay in withdrawal to indifference on the part of my Government, I must ask you to place this telegram before the Cabinet.I feel confident that a perusal of the previous correspondence, since 10th February, of which a short resume is given below, will show, that there has been no desire or attempt to delay the withdrawal from Meshed for one moment longer than was necessary, nor that there has been any misunderstanding as regards the position on the part of my military advisers who have been most anxious from the first, to be free of a dangerous detachment at the earliest possible moment.In reply to (0051), 10th February, saying that the Cabinet desired to recall all troops from South and East Persia, a reply was sent on 21st February, telegram No. 204 S., recommending reduction of the force at Meshed to one-and-a-half squadrons of cavalry, and pointing out that the withdrawal of the rest of the force would take five months.On 15th March, in your telegram No. nil, you stated that you viewed with great misgiving the reduction recommended and suggested that - if existing situation could be maintained a little longer the Bolsheviks&apos;Afghan relations were likely to be
strained to breaking point, and in conclusion you proposed as an alternative a lesser reduction of the Meshed force and the lines of communication.In reply to this, on 19th March, in telegram No. 3721, I adhered to the former proposal, and again pointed out that the retention of the force was unnecessary from a military point of view, and that it was incapable of resisting serious attack.I considered that the positioD of the Arabs had been maintained by bluff, and that any measures such as were suggested by you.would invite attack.On the 1st April, in telegram No. 4209, it was pointed out that the position of the force was likely to become more serious the longer it remained where it was, and a further reminder was again sent you on the 16th April, telegram 4803.On the 26th April you said in your telegram, 1474, that definite orders might be delayed as to the withdrawal, and that the attitude of bluff was to be maintained. You added that question of retention or otherwise of his outposts was a matter which should be left to the discretion of the General Officer Commanding, Meshed, as he was better situated to appreciate the local situation and the probable result of such action.On 1st May, in telegram 5494, I made a further urgent request for an early decision as regards withdrawal.On the 5th May, that is over two months after my first recommendation for withdrawal was made, your telegram No. 1651, ordering immediate withdrawal to take place, was despatched, and in it you urged that (? that omitted) operation should be expedited as much as possible. Action on this telegram was taken immediately, and all officers concerned were urged to spare no effort to carry out the withdrawal as rapidly as possible.&apos; A revised estimate was asked for.On the 13th May, in my telegram 6066, it was pointed out that the physical difficulties and the unsuitable time of year rendered it impossible to guarantee that the estimate of five months could be reduced. Every effort would be made to do so.On the 14th May, Tehran was informed that the withdrawal had been ordered to take place at once, and since then, as you are aware, much pressure has been brought by Tehran on the Home Government to postpone withdrawal, and it was the fear that this pressure would influence His Majesty&apos;s Government that caused me to send my telegrams 679 S. of the 1st June, and 8285 of the 1st July.On receipt also of your telegram of the 5th May several important questions .arose regarding the disposal of stores, &amp;c, for which a plan had been drawn up under the orders of the General Officer Commanding, Quetta, on whom the supervision of the arrangements for the withdrawal rests, but which it was necessary to definitely settle before withdrawal began. These were referred to you in my No. 6787 of the 29th May, and reminders dated 19th June and 1st July, 7769 and 8375, were subsequently sent. No reply was received until the 7th July, your telegram 2331, dated 5th July, another two months&apos; delay*. On receipt of this telegram orders were issued to the General Officer Commanding, Quetta, to collect all stores at Meshed -and Duzdap pending a reply to your telegram to the Foreign Office, and to carry on at once with his arrangements on those line?. Several unforeseen difficulties have arisen on the lines of communication to Meshed owing to delay in water arrangements and transport, but these have been overcome, and I feel confident that the General Officer Commanding, Quetta, and the General Officer Commanding, Meshed, and the General Officer Commanding, Lines of Communication, have spared no effort to expedite matters. As regards this I would ask you to consider the difficulties of the withdrawal of this force along a line of communications of 640 miles through a difficult, and in many places, waterless country, and the detailed preparations that they must necessarily entail. The General Officer Commanding, Quetta, has now reported that the movements can be commenced on 24th July, and no further orders to the General Officer Commanding, Meshed, are required as he fully understands the urgency of the case, which has been impressed on him many times. You will understand that preparations on lines of communications have been going on for withdrawal ever since the telegram of 5th May.As regards the detachments you refer to, the orders to the General Officer Commanding, Meshed, are as laid down in your telegram 1474 of the 26th April. He has no doubt found it necessary to retain these detachments on frontier until he is able to withdraw from Meshed itself, and I am loath to interfere as regards disposition of these detachments as such action may hamper the General Officer Commanding, Meshed, at a critical time.* Five weeks would be more accurate. As will have been seen above, the Foreign Office telegraphed to Tehran on 9th June, but received no reply until 7th July.
Telegram from Secretary of State to Viceroy, Army Department,dated Uth July 1920.2444. Your telegram of 19th June, 7769. Surplus stores in East Persia. Please see telegram No. 470, dated 7th-July, from Minister, Tehran, repeated to you. Apparently stores will not be taken over by Persian Government. War Office has referred question of disposal to Disposal Board.
