MX&apos; NATIONAL K5 DERATION Cg*DXSCHARiBB &amp; XEMOBIlrlSSD SAILORS &amp; SOLDIERS.Head Offioe -fc\ IDDLBSUaiGH HOUSE, OAX3POK STREET,LONDON, S.VT.1. BOth July. 19 0.Dfe T.J. Macnamara, Ministry of Labour, Montagu House, Richmond Terrace, Whitehall, S. W. 1.Dear Sir,I have been instructed by embassy national Executive Council to coBHaunio&amp;ti with you with reference to the present position of ex-service men who are unemployed^As you are probably aware, the real position of this matter 1* not reflected at all by the official figures of the Ministry of Labour.    Thar* are any thousands of ex-service men at the present moment unemployed, and who ha^e been unemployed for mm considerable tires,,who are not registeredjrt tag Official Labour Exchangee.The position with reference to this Question is rapidly becoming extremely serious and my National Executive Council view with groat concern the position which has arisen in many parts of the country i,It la understood that in the mm future the out-of-work donation will entirely cease, and then the whole of the exrservioe s$n who by reason of their service are cut of employment will become entirely dependant either on the charity of friends or on seme eort of casual employment yI am sure yon will be the first to appreciate the fact that at any rate the majority of these men, have had na chance during the last six years to provide for a lengthy period of unemployment and in view of this fact and the great danger which exists with reference to this question, I am instructed by my Executive to request that a further extension of the out-of-work donation shall be conceded to ex-service men until such times as the Government have fulfilled their duty and provided the necessary employment for those men, who by reason of their services to the State are at the present moment, to a large extent, destitute, and will become even more so on the cessation cf the out-of-work donation.Of course, you will appreciate that this Federation realises th&amp;t payment of out-of-work donation is not in any sense a solution of the unemployment problem and we should infinitely prefer to see the whole question satisfactorily solved, rather than that the out-of-werk donation should continue, but it would appear that in view of the very unsatisfactory way in which the whole question has been dealt with, there is no alternative, if serious destitution and trouble is to be averted.Yours faithfully, (Signed) J.R. GRIFFIN.General Secretary.Telephone: Victoria 3078.
