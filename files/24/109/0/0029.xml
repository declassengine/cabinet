^./euy^^- 1280opy ^Qy ...    &apos;DKFIDENTIAL.CAB I HE T.J P 6 -	-1628.	-217.)FOOD SITUATION IN GEMflY,Memorandum presented by the German Delegation at the International T6iTi&apos;irahTe&quot;&apos;^ 3d&quot; at&quot;&quot;Spa&apos;V July 19%C(Circulated for Information.)The Irirae Minister, M. Millerand, has.-declared that the Allied Powers are willing to conclude an agreement with Germany regarding the supply of foodstuffs, with a view to remedying the distress among, /the German population.The German people are very grateful for the initiative thus taken, and greet it the more joyfully since the German nation knows that, without this assistance from the Allies, it could not possibly throw off the heavy burden constituted by insufficient nourishment, which robs it of all joy in work, and desire for work, and is the source of all its political economic and social difficulties.I take the liberty of including a few &quot;figures in the following statement, in order to prove the extent of the prevailing distress and the urgency of prompt succour.The great difficult with respect of food in Germany, wHUcli has latterly assumed a peculiarly menacing, character, is due--(1) to a marked falling off in agricultural production both during and since: the war:(2) to the impossibility which Germany is experiencing of importing sufficient quantities of forage (cattle fodder^ crude phosphates, ettf.. for the purpose of increasing agricultural production:(3) to the lack of the necessary.means of payment to cover imports of these foodstuffs.which.are lacking.As a result of the extraordinary/difficulties experienced during the war, and of the lack of: labour, fertilizers, etc. the cultivated area $evBted to the production of breadstuffs, the cereals required for cattle fodder, potatoes and, sugar beet has greatly decreased, and at the same time the. average yield per unit of area is much reduced.
: -  i; 129In the period from 1913 to 1919, the yield per hectare fell off to the extent of:-81$ for breadstuffs (cereals)25% for cereals required for cattle31$ for potatoes.30$ for sugar beet.The total harvest in Germany, taking her new frontiers intoccnsideratirn, decreased, during the period from 1913 to 1919:-for bread-making cereals   from about 13,300,000 tons to 8,500,000 tons:for potatoes, from about 40,300,000 tons to 21,400,000 tons:for sugar beet, from about 12,900,000 tons to 5,800,000 tons.A fact which renders the situation more critical is that the surrender of rich&apos;agricultural territory, especially that situated to the j&amp;ast, represents a very considerable loss of excess agricultural production %9 Germany (after deducting the amount consumed by the territory surrendered on the ;?,est.This excess of production over consumption would have sufficed, as regards cereals, to supply approximately 3,800,000 persons on the basis of the present flour ration, 3,400,000 persons on the basis of the potato ration, 5,600,000 persons on the basis of the sugar ration, all for one year.Prom 1913 to 1919, stocks of horned cattle decreased from approximately 18,000,000 to 16,500,000/ the number of milch cov.s fell off from 9,100,000 to 7,600,000, the number of pigs from 18; 500,000/to 11,500,000, that is to say, no less than 41$. The considerable decrease in the number of pigs has all the        &apos; more effect on the food situation in general, since the pig constituted the primary and (in a proportion of 65% the chief resource of the German population, both for meat and fat.The annual yield of milk from one oow has fallen off from 2,700 litres in 1913, to 1,200 litres in 1919.    It may be said* 2 -
that, between 1913 and 1919, the annual milk production in Germany has decreased from 24,400,000,000 of litres to 9,000,000,000 litres;. ,Finally, the f eight, of the cattle, pigs and sheep slaughtered has decreased by from 50 to 30^.To sum up, it will be seen that the German population has available at the present time a considerably reduced quantity of animal and vegetable foodstuffs produced within German territory.,     For this reason, Germany is obliged to continue the system of rationing introduced during thewar for a number of the most important food productso     The rations have, however, to be kept within such meagre pro-portions that they jniy yield about half the number of calories required by an adult-The fact that Germany Is not yet enabled to import the required foodstuffs in sufficient quantities accounts for the melancholy circumstance that the German population continues to be in a state of serious malnutrition, which claims a terrible number of victims.     Thus in 365 localities compris-ing a population of about 25,000,000 Inhabitants, the birth-rate of living infants was, according to available official statistics, 459,753 in 1919, as against 633,815 in 1915,    In 1914, 52,924 infants from 1 to 5 years of age died in Prussia this number rose to 67,369 In 1918, although the number of births during that year showed a falling off of about 40$* In MecMenburg-Schwerin, an agricultural State, these figures were 544 in 1914/ 1040 in 1918.The mortality among children of from 5 to 15 was:-In Prussia:     .,..n in 1914,   25,730in 1910&apos;,   50,3^1In Mecklenburg-Cchwerin:     in 1914,        560in 1918,        819..This shocking increase of mortality among children of school age is undoubtedly due to the scarcity of milk andother foodstuffs containing albumen and fats.      Any
-   131improvement in the German milk production is hindered by the deliveries of milch cows to France and Belgium.In the 365 localities mentioned above , containing a popu-lation of 24,600,000! the deaths due to tuberculosis amounted to 15.7 per 10,000 in 1913* and 27.1 in 1919;   that is to say, they showed an increase of 11*4.If, on the one hand^ the health and strength of the rising generation are being destroyed * on the other hand the chronic malnutrition of adults prevents them from regaining their full capacity for work%   Consequently, it is Impossible to Increase the present entirely inadequate output of factories and mines. It is more especially from mining districts that complaints with regard to obviously Insufficient food are constantly being received, particularly owing t0&apos;the fact that it has, for instance., been necessarv to mix other substances with wheat to the extent of 80$-, and also to lower the quality of bread kept for Invalids..    Notwithstanding the goodwill of the workers,&apos; this circumstance must lead to a fresh diminution in the output of coal., owin.? to their physical weakness,.The situation is further complicated b?y the fact that the present serious position of German Industry makes it impossi--ble for an increasing proportion of the population to buy the whole of the food to which their ration cards entitle them, as its price exceeds the purchasing capacity of the population, although the State has reduced the cost of some provisions0    At present the weekly ration - which&apos;represents 12,600 calories, Including, pulse, sugar, marmalade and artificial honey-- costs Mk.-101*04, whereas six years ago it would only have cost Mk. 7.,77.   In the present state of German finances, It is impossible for the Government further to reduce the price of this ration,.     It is rather necessary, by&apos; all possible means to avoid any charges connected with the reduction of food -prices being incurred at the public expense a&quot;       &quot;
It-must, therefore, be said that the position of the German people with regard to food supplies has become much worse since the war, instead of improving.    The actual position is that the inhabitants are greatly underfed owing to their rations being totally inadequate, and, moreover that a great number of persons have not sufficient means to purchase even these inadequate rations.The possibility of restoring the pre-war rate of agricultural production in Germany is still very limited, and that it is why it has become absolutely necessary for Germahy to appeal for efficacious outside aid in re-establishing normal food conditions.    Without help from abroad, Germany is unable &apos;kw feed her people properly, and thus to free, them from the state of nervous strain which encourages&apos;political disturbances, and thereby remove the source of all her difficulties, -It is not enough that foreign countries should export large quantities of food supplies to Germany;   this should be done under conditions which would make it practically possible for Germany to pay for such, supplies.In order to increase her home production more effectively, Germany must be given the possibility of import-ing phosphates, pyrites, and such grain for cattle fodder as may be required to replenish her supply of livestock.Taking into account all the considerations set forth above     and more especially the decrease in the area under cultivation, the yield of crops, and the result of this year&apos;s ,harvest - Germany will have to import the following in order to cover her requirements for next ecor&amp;smic year, viz:-&apos;   &apos; 2,000,000 /
..   2,000,000 tons of breadstuffs,2,000,000 tons of cereals for cattle fodder, 750,000 tons of oil&apos;seeds, 180,000 tons of neat and bacon, 144/000 tons of fats, 500,000 tons of fish,and500,000 tons of crude phosphates, with the corresponding quantity of;,S50.,000 tons of iron pyrites*,     This would represent a total value of Mks* 3,403;600,000 gold,A satisfactory settlement of the food question in Germany is and remainst the first and most important condition for ensuring the success of all other measures to be taken with a view to increasing Germany1 a economic- capacity,:The German Delegation, therefore, proposes that the Spa Conference should resolve that a fcommission of experts belonging to the various countries should meet at the earliest possible date, in order to consider measures for improving the food situation in Germany and. to submit concrete proposals to the Powers represented at the Spa Conference,SPA, July 1920,
