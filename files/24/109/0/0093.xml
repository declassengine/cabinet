MEMORANDUM BY THE HOMifl SECRETARY ON THE QUESTION WHETHER PASSPORTS SHOULD BE REFUSED TO BRITISH REVOLUTIONARIESWISHING TO GO TO RUSSIA.The question has arisen whether passports should be granted to Arthur MacManus and David Ramsay, two men with revolutionary records who wish to go to Russia.No-one has a legal right to a passport, but the general rule is in time cf peace to give passports to all British subjects who apply, and refusal must be justified by some strong reason.The two men in question are working for the Third International, and the reasons for refusing passports would be that their visit to Russia may possibly strengthen the connection between the Bolsheviks and the revolutionary element in this country, and also that they will probably get money from the Bolsheviks and on their return be in a better position to do mischief in this country.   The refusal could be publicly defended on the ground that there was reason to believe that the object of these men in gpinp- to Russia was definitely hostile to the national interestNotes are attached giving the records of the two men.Before asking the Foreign Office to refuse the grant of passports I desire to take the opinion of my colleagues.E.S *24. 7. 20.
DAVID RAMSAY.David Ramsay is a pattern maker and a member of the Amalgamated Society of Engineers and is the Treasurer and Organizer of the National Administrative Council of the Shop Stewards&apos; and Workers1 Committees.He was fined  100 on 11.5.16 for attempting to prejudice recruiting.On 16*2.19 Ramsay was arrested and charged under D.R.R.42 for inciting to sedition and was sentenced to six months&apos; imprisonment.He has been present at the recent meetings in G-rosvenoi4 Square, to protect against the Polish Offensive.   He has stated in public that if men were called up for the army they should not refuse, but should take rifles, adding, &quot;do not refuse to take them and I hope you will knbw what to do with them.&quot;Ramsay has accepted the platform of the 3rd International and is a supporter of Mclanus and the United Communist Party. He may be regarded as an active and dangerous revolutionary with a fair amount of influence.In Mayf 1920, he applied for a passport to settle in the Argentine; this was granted.   In June, 1920, he applied for an endorsement of his passport to go to Scandinavia to &quot;visit relations&quot;.   It was asceftained that &quot;his relation&quot; was a well known Bolshevik agent in Bergen.
 RTHUR MoMANUS.Arthur McManus, who is a fitter and a member of the Amalgamated Society of Engineers, oame under notioe in March, 1916, when he was editor of the &quot;Glasgow Socialist&quot; and was responsible for much labour unrest on the Clyde.   On March 25th he was arrested with others, and deported to Edinburgh, because he had intended to bring out the shipbuilders on that day and then gp to Woolwich and bring out the men there.He took a prominent part in the engineers strike at Manchester in May 1917.   He was the proposer of the &quot;immediate Armistice&quot; resolution at Sir Auckland Geddes&apos;s meeting at Glasgow on the 2Gth January, 1917.   On May 17th he ms arrested for endeavouring to promote strikes and was brought to London, but was subsequently discharged.MoManus was actively connected with the Clyde strike of January,1919. On 17th January, 1919, he was nominated one of a committee of 15, formed to act as a Central Committee in readiness ibr the coming revolution.In February, 1920, McManus applied for a passport under false pretences, claiming that he was going abroad in a commercial capacity for a Manchester firm whoso manager was a Bolshevist and had shielded Conscientious Objectors during the war.   McManus is now Chairman of the &quot;United Communist Party&quot;.   This party has definitely accepted a platform of the Third Inter-national and is a most important body of Communists in this country.    He may be regarded as a most dangerous type of agitator and as his is the only Communist Party which has the full approval of Lenin and is the one for which Rothstein works, it seems clear that the object of his desired visit to Russia is to obtain funds for this party.
