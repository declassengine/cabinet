(a.j. 2u).   &apos; suggestions as to &apos;payment of reparation,&quot;Presented by the German Delegation at Spa.1.The German Government conceives that it is the object of the present negotiations to attempt to arrive at* a final and joint settlement of its total reparation obligations *2.&quot;  -The German Government draws attention to the fact that, according to their calculations, the 20 milliards of gold marks payable by May 1,1921, have not only already been paid but that payment of a very considerably higher amount has already been effected.    Documentary evidence of this can be produced.Any arrangement for the future, which the German Government . &apos; will be able to recognise as possible of fulfilment, can only be^ based on the economic and financial capacity of Germany.     In this connection it is especially necessary to take into account the fact that the Budget of the German State -must balance; other-wise a further rapid increase of floating debt and consequent inflation will neutralise any capacity for payment.4.With regard, to the extent of the German capacity for payment, the German Government refers to the Memoranda handed in.     It takes up the standpoint that, in particular no further diminution of the fundamental bases of the. German political&apos;.economy which have already been much weakened will occur, and that the indispensable international economic, sources of supply will, be regained.-   Germany must above all be able to import the necessary foodstuffs, fodder,-r--
^ei*ttXl&amp;ers-and -^the/r-wterlals -on sutta^le-condltloni of payment.5*If the German capability is used as a basis, the following result is obtained:-(a) The obligation to make reparation is to be expressed in annuities and the minimum of such annuities is to be fixed.(b) The obligation to pay such annuities is limited to 30 .   years according to the time limit given in the Treatyof Versailles-(c) The minimum of such annuity is to be fixed according to the German economic and financial capacities.   It there-fore comprises all obligations of Germany for payment in money and kind according to the Treaty of Versaillesj especially also the obligation to pay expenses of the Army of Occupation.(d) The annuities are partly covered by payment in kind which have to be made according to the Treaty of Ver-sallies.   These payments In kind must in principle be credited according to universal market prices.   Another part of these annuities is to be paid in money.   If Germany makes payments in kind which exceed the partof the annuities to be jjaid in kind, these are to be paid in money according to universal market prices-(e) As the economic development of the next 30 years cannot be foretold to-day, a partaking of the Allied Governments in considerable improvement of financial and economic conditions of Germany must be provided for-For this a plan must be worked out.
(f) A maximum sum&apos;is to be fixed; after the payment Of which Germany Is to be free from every further obligation to make&quot;reparation.(g) Experts from-both parties are to meet as soon as possible in order tb fix the minimum annuity based on Germany^/capacity;    (a) and in order to fix also the securities for this purpose which are yet to be defined, and which must not impinge upon German sovereignty in financial matters *    Further, the experts are to work ou** the Index Scheme (e) and ,are. also to fix rthe maximum sum, (f) as well as to.test the evidence in connection with No. 8*SPA,July 11th, 1920o
