(THIS DOCggyT 13 THS PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANfflC MAJESTY1 S GOTOTOKT.)c. P. 1631.CABIK^T.INAUDIBILITY OF MIEISTTSRS1 SP^CrTSS.Copy of letter to the. Private Secretary to Mr. Bonar Law, from the Secretary to the Press ,,Gallery Commit toc, Houseof Commons.( Circulated at the rogues^ of Mr. Bonar Law.)9-)Copy No.J.C.-C.Davidson/ 3sq.,0,3.House of Commons&apos;, -Press Gallery,July 13, 1920Dear Sir,Buring recent weeks the greatest difficulty has been ex-ineperienced in the Press Gallery in hearing answers given,&apos; and occasionally speeches made, by Kri Bonar Law and in a lesser de-gree by other Ministers.   So frequent have been the complaints that the Press Gallery Committee have unanimously passed the following, resolution:&quot;That the Secretary be Instructed to protest in the strongest possible terns, against the inaudibility of the - Leader of the House and of many of his colleeigues in answering questions, and that the attention of Ministers be drawn, not only to the. unfair strain thereby thrown upon members of the Press Gallery, but also to the danger of serious mistakes being made in the attempt to interpret Ministerial replies.&quot;In communicating this to you, I am asked to point out that, were any serious mistake made in conveying to the public an impor-tant Ministerial statement, the blame would almost tertainly be cast upon the reporter. The accoustics of the Chamber are undeni-ably bad, but my Committee suggest that even the trained ear of the reporter can hardly be expected to catch words which are inaudible to Members on the floor of the House.So far as the private Member is concerned, clear outspoken speech is not so vitally important, but my Committee believe that Mr.... Bonar Law &quot;rill agree with them that it is imperative that His Majesty&apos;s Ministers should- bear in mind that they are addressing not only the House of Commons but the country as a whole.^e are fully convinced that Mr. Sonar Law and his -colleagues are only too anxious to assist&apos; in this matter; it is in that
belief that we would ask if&quot;Mr. Bonar Law could see his way to have our difficulties made known to his colleagues of the Cabinet,     I can assure you that we would not dra*Ar Mr. Bonar Law&apos;a attention to these difficulties werft they not so serious.Believe me, Sir,Yours faithfully, . (Sighed)   wm. VEITCH.. Hon. Secretary.2 Whitehall Gardens. S-.VL.liJuly 16th, 1920.
