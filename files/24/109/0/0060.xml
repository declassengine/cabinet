rrlIS DOCUMENT Tr THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOfetNMSNT) .S:&apos;CRST. CP.1657.COPY NO.TJO. &amp;CABINET.IRELAND. REFUSAL OF RAILWAYHEN TO CARRY POLICE AND MILITARY AND MUNITIONS. Memorandum by the Chief Secretary for ireland circulate for the information of the Cabinet a letter  * from-the Chairman of the Great Northern Railway, Ireland, on the refusal of Irish railv.raymen to handle police military and muni-tions traffic.It is now more than 4 weeks since the policy laid down by the Government through the Ministry of Transport for dealing with the munitions strike was put into operation.Traffic has been tendered to the Railways in the ordinary course.   A number of men have been dismissed and in certain areas in tfce West and South there has been a partial dislocation, some branch lines being blocked.   For over a month the military and the police have been deprived of the use of the railways ana the strain is beginning to tell.   The public have had to put up with incon-venience, but not sufficient to force the Railwaymen back to work.I think with General Macready who has expressed himself very strongly to me on the subject that the time has come when the Government must * take a firm stand.   I submit that the Government can properly say to the Railways that they have had ample time in which to make ar-rangements to fulfil their obligations as common carriers and that the Government must now insist that the Railways shall either carry Government traffic or go out of action.It is in my view imperative that immediate action should . be taken on these lines.Irish Office,20th July, 1920.(Sgd)    HAMAR GREEN1&quot;.&apos;00D.
ENCLOSURE 1,Copy of letter frorq the Chairman of the Great ^orth^yn Railway qompany Ireland, to the Chief Secretary for Ireland.Great Northern Railway Company, Ireland, Amiens Street Station, Dublin.19th July, 1920,Sir,For the past 5 weeks, this Company in common with other Irish Railway Companies, have been acting upon the instructions conveyed in a letter dated June the 10th (a copy of which is attached) from Sir Francis Dimnell of the Ministry of Transport to the Chairman of the Standing Committee of Irish General Managers.The resultant position on this Railway is that, except in one case on one Branch where the Police withdrew; all traffic has eventually been worked, but there have been 11 refusal incidents, in connection with which about 40 men have been dismissed,   A more serious aspect of the matter is that a number of the loyal servants of the Company have been kidnapped, kept prisoners, and forced ai the point of the revolver to sign an undertaking not to work or assist in the working of Military traffic, with the threat that a refusal would mean death.   A driver has been tarred &amp; feathered for previous working of Military traffic, notwithstanding which he drove his engine despite his deplorable condition; and generally speaking the Staff know that it is safer to refuse to work Govern^ ment traffic than to do their duty.   That ir. the position on this Line whero Military traffic is worked; on the Lines serving the South &amp; west it is notorious that none i s worked, and that hundreds of men have been discharged.My Company fully appreciate the difficulties of the Government in this matter, and realise that to accord to railflaymen the right to discriminate against Government or indeed against any traffic, would be fatal to the civilised life of the community.   At the same time they submit with great respect that the present method of dealing with this conspiracy is altogether ineffectual; and productive cf the worst results as regards the interests of the law abiding members of the community, the discipline of the railway-men, and the prestige of the forces of the Crown,My Company emphatically protest against an indefinite continuance of the existing state of affairs, and they suggest that the Government should formally intimate to the Irish Railways that they (the Government) cannot continue to contribute to the wages of men who refuse to handle Military traffic, and that the Companies must obtain an undertaking from their men to work all traffic, and give notice to terminate the servicegof such as refuse.By this means a ridiculous situation would be brought to a head, and tho community at large, and the railwaymen in particular, be made to realise that they are dependent upon the Government, the one for railway facilities and.the other for the existing high railway wages.I am, Sir,Your obedient servant, (Signed) FANE VERNOH.Chairman,The Right Hon,Sir Hamar Greenwood Bart, K.C.,M.P., Chief Secretary for Ireland, Irish Office,Westminster, London,S,V/,
ENCLOSURE II.Copy of letter from the Secretary, Ministry of Transport to the Chairman,&quot;Standing Corn-mi ttee of General Managers, Irish Railways.MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT,, . 6, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1. -10th June, 1920,Sir,I am directed by the Minister of Transport to state that it has come to his knowledge that difficulties have arisen in Ireland by reason of the fact that railwaymen in certain places have recently been discriminating in.the handling of traffic, and in particular have refused to handle certain Government traffic.   Railway Companies are under certain stat-utory obligations in regard to the receiving and forwarding of traffic and these obligations must be carried out.   In particu-lar I am to point out that discrimination against Government traffic cannot possibly be justified in- view of the fact that a large subsidy is being paid by the Government to the. Irish Railways and the Railways at the present time are under Govern-ment control.If, therefore, the men or a section of them persist in their present attitude the Companies shouldy in the&apos; view of the Government, deal with their employees in accordance with their Regulations relating to disobedience of orders.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant, ; (Signed)     FRANCIS DU&amp;fELL.The Chairman,Standing Committee of General Managers, Irisfc Railway Clearing House, 5, Kildare Street, .      DUBLIN.
