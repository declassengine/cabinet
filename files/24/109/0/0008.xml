J ij o3&apos;;y&apos;o G6vgrnmelit.ciliated bv the Secretary of State for India,SECRET-The Anglo-French Petroleum Agreement and Mesopotamia.Memorandum by Secretary of State fob India.With reference to the memoranda recently circulated by the,Minister in charge of the Petroleum Department and the First Lord of the Admiralty/jvmy colleagues may like to see a telegram wmch I have just received from the Acting Civil Commissioner. When the question of private enterprise was discussed in the spring of last year, all the Departments concerned were in favour of it, and the single dissentient was the Acting Civil Commissioner.   His acquiescence now makes the unanimity complete.The last paragraph of Mr. Long&apos;s Memorandum must, I think, have been written under a misapprehension. He says u that it is strongly recommended that one of the &quot; conditions imposed on the Company formed to develop the Mesopotamian field should &quot; be that the Government share in the production taken by way of royalty, should be &quot; in the form of fuel oil (not crude oil) for the Navy.&quot; But the Government which will grant the concession and receive the royalty will be the Arab Government of Mesopotamia, which will rely upon the oil royalty as one of its main sources of revenue. The supply of fuel oil to the British Navy must apparently be a matter for arrangement between the British Government and the Company.12th. July 1920. E. S. M.Telegram from Civil Commissioner, Baghdad, to Secretary of State for India,dated 1th July 1920.   ..Recent answers by the Prime Minister to questions in Parliament regarding methods of working Mesopotamian oil fields lead me to think that question may be under active consideration.I accordingly submit following observations : Successful working of Mesopotamian oil fields by direct Government agency presupposes a high degree of efficiency not in one but in every branch of administration of the country if it is to be reasonably successful; it involves complete freedom from Treasury control and expert guidance at every stage, both on the spot and at home. I now regard (? such) conditions as unattainable, and consequently, though with much regret, advocate their exploitation by private enterprise, (? subject to) suitable conditions as regards royalties, &amp;c.It has been suggested in the. English Press that the Mesopotamian field is sufficiently large to be divided into several spheres which might be allocated by Mesopotamian Government or other competent authority amongst rival interests.I am strongly of opinion that this view is mistaken. There is a considerable element of speculation involved in the sinking of large sums of money necessary to find oil in Mesopotamia in paying quantities in the first place, and it seems certain that Mesopotamian fields, if they prove as rich as alleged, cannot be adequately developed except by a pipe-line to the Mediterranean, reaching the sea either in the neighbourhood of Alexandretta or Baifa.In either case it will be necessary to sink further large capital sums in the construction of the pipe-line, and the Company which constructs the pipe-line may, in addition, find it necessary to contribute considerable capital sums towards the construction of railway along the alignment finally selected for the pipe to follow.Whilst I have in no way changed my views as to the desirability of direct management by large oil companies as opposed to management by managing agents, I am strongly of opinion that Anglo-Persian Oil Company is best fitted to be entrusted by Mesopotamian State witln the exploitation by private enterprise of Mesopotamian oil fields upon the terms to be arranged.Apart from the consideration of nationality, as to which I am not competent to speak, the fact that it has now taken over, or is in process of acquiring from the military authorities in Mesopotamia, the wbole system, distribution and storage of oil, including the river steamers and barges, puts it in a very strong position locally which it has hitherto not abused.10   1880     100  7.20[p.t.o.
The Company have recognised and indisputable pre-war rights in the Chaiah -Surkh and in Naft Khana oil fields, whicji are at least as promising as any others in Mesopotamia and considerably more accessible, and are extending into Northern Persia.They have already a refinery under construction at Baghdad, and possess their own office, workshop, and other establishments at Abadan, Mohammerah, Basrah and Baghdad.They have an expert geological staff and an amount of local experience to which no other company can aspire.To give the management of any field in Mesopotamia to another group would involve duplication of above installations resulting in much unnecessary capital expenditure,
