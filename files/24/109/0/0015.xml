Dobbs 89 S., dated 8th July :-&quot; At official discussion to-day Afghans presented clause on lines of that foreshadowed in ray telegram 121 M.C. of 1st July asking for assistance in shape of renewal of subsidy and free grant of material,&quot; &amp;c. Statement was prefaced by remark that there were some matters on frontier still requiring early discussion and settlement. In reply to enquiry Afghans said they meant that Maffey&apos;s frontier demarcation last year should be revised so as to give them Torkham regarding which they claimed that some remarks by Grant and Maffey at Ravyalpindi meeting of 8th August had left Afghan delegates under the impression that Torkham would fall to them in demarcation and that they had signed peace treaty on strength of that impression. Discussion of nearly live hours was devoted to combating Afghan arguments which were most obstinately pressed. Delegates had previously informed me privately that (they) were forced to have official argument on this point.as Nadir Khan had.written that our possession of Torkham made all his defensive schemes in the neighbourhood of Dakka useless and had insisted that they must make desperate attempt to.get demarcation revised ; to-day&apos;s discussion was, therefore put up job.&quot;, 1 o 1 /L
