H.I.I.-................ll II ........I.MIRISH   SITUATION. Note by Sir John Andarson,I venture, with the consent of tho Chief Secretary, tosubmit to the Cabinet a few observations suggested by theperusal of tho Memorandum circulated yesterday by thfc LordjCP. 1683   president of the Council/It is not for me to offer an opinion upon tho political aspects of the Irish question;   but it has Seen my business during the last two months to study the administrative problems and thoy era peculiarly difficult - with whioh the Irish Government is confronted at the present time.     The basic fact, which cannot be ignored, is that., broadly speaking., the entire population in the South and T,7ost, so far as it is not actually hostile, is out of sympathy.with the Government and cannot bo reliod upon to co-oporato in tho carrying out of ovon the most reasonable and moderate measures-.     This does not mean merely that the Government is deprived of the support of public opinion.   The mischief goes much deeper.     The Local Authorities, which over a wide sphere are the agents of tho Central Government, are profoundly disaffected.     The machinery tho Courts has boon brought virtually to :a standstill and rival Courts are functioning openly, and, whore forcibly suppressed, will continue to function in secret.     The Local Civil Service,, composed cntiroly of Irishmen, while in a sense not disloyal, is politically alienated, and, exposed as it is to ev*iry kind of pressure and in many cases of intimidation, cannot be relied upon in the execution of a vigorous policy.     That splendid force, the R.I.C, ill-found and inadequately supported, has held together under most adverse circumstances longer and., better than those having knowledge of the conditions had any
right to expect.   Even now it is et most valuable instrument; but its future &quot;lay at this moment, In the balance&quot;.In these circumstances two alternative methods of restoring law and order suggest themselves - one depending entirely upon superior force, the other designed to secure a considerable measure of popular support for such forcible measures as may &quot;he founa necessary..      If force and force alone is to be relied upon, the strongest measures must,     in my judgment, be applied and with the least possible delay.   I am convinced that) for the reasons I have indicated above, no material assistance in the execution of such a policy could be obtained from the estab-lished agencies of oivil Government.   This means, in effect, a: ifiilitary dictatorship - in other words, a form of martial law - extending over the&apos;whole sphere of administration, Including those services not now controlled by the Irish Executive&apos;.   Whether such a policy would be effective in re*-storing order, bringing criminals to&apos;justice and depriving the -extremists of the means of further mischief&apos;) is a matter for serious consideration; and&quot;I trust the Cabinet will examine this aspect of the question very closelyln the light of the opinions of the competent military authorities before coming to.any decision.   I will only say that, ^taking everything into account, including the condition of the military forces now in Ireland, I feel profound misgiving on the point..   The effect of such a policy upon the^ultimate political settlement is outside the scope,of-this note.The alternative to a policy of naked force is the course suggested by;the Cabinet last Friday.   I believe that j if what is. commonly described as Dominion Home r,ule - witia pro-tection for Ulster - could be offered immediately sufficient popular support would be obtained in Ireland to enable the suppression of crime, and the re-establishment of law* to be effected by means of the ordinary ciivll machinery temporarily
reinforced.   I believe the Local Authorities would function.   I am sure that the public service could be relied upon and that, in a very short time, the Civil Courts Could be restored to full activity.   There would be no discon- &apos; discontinuity in administration such as the other course would inevitably involve,I see clearly the political difficulties, but it is at least a question whether there is any alternative not foredoomed to failure; and It is because I feel so uneasy on this point that I have ventured to obtrude my views upon the consideration of the Cabinet,(Intd)   JYA.IRISH OFFICEj S,W. 25th July; 1920,
