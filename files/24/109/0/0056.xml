A   /[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]&quot;Printed for the Cabinet. July 1920.CONFIDENTIAL.C.P.-1653.[E 8300/9/44]THESE papers relate to a matter in dispute between the Foreign Office and the Treasury, viz., the temporary continuance of the monthly subsidy at present being paid to the King of the Hejaz. The case of this and other similar subsidies to Arab Chiefs is raised in its larger as well as in its narrower aspect in the accompanying Despatch from Lord Allenby, and is explained in the Foreign Office Note.I must ask the Cabinet for an early decision.CofK.Foreign Office,July 13, 1920.Memorandum on the Subsidies to King Hussein and Ibn Saud.On the 5th May last Lord Allenby was consulted by the Secretary of State as to the desirability of continuing the payment of a subsidy to the King &quot;of the Hejaz. Lord Allenby gave it as his opinion that continuance was most important, and recommended that the amount should be 250,000 rupees per mensem. The Secretary of State concurred in this recommendation and approached the Treasury on the i5th May for sanction for payment at this rate to be continued until the independence of the Hejaz had been finally ratified by the Peace Treaty, or until some alternative scheme had been elaborated with the other Powers interested whichever might be the earlier. The Treasury in their reply of the 18th June intimated that they were unable to sanction these payments until some general policy with regard to subsidies to Arab rulers could be laid down. On the 30th June the Foreign Office replied that, while fully appreciating the desire of the Treasury for a formulation of policy, it would be premature to attempt this at the present juncture. Sanction for this subsidy was again requested and it was intimated that, in the event of the Treasury being unable to concur, the question would be laid before the Cabinet. On. the 7th July, the Treasury concurred in the latter course.The attached despatch from Lord Ailenby deals with the whole question of ouar future Arabian policy, and draws attention to the indirect responsibilities which His Majesty&apos;s Government might be deemed to have incurred in that region. The consideration of the general questions of policy raised by Lord Allenby must await the result of the negotiations now being conducted in Paris on our &quot; special position &quot; in Arabia, as well as a decision on the question of the machinery to be set up: in London to give effect to His Majesty&apos;s Governments policy in the Middle East. But in the meanwhile, the continuance of the Hejaz subsidy is a matter of urgency and the following statement of the facts is submitted to show how considerable are the Imperial interests involved.The Hejaz is an original member&apos; of the League of Nations and thus will be entirely independent under the Turkish Treaty. Its importance is due to the fact that the Moslem Holy Places Mecca and Medina lie within it. Each year these towns form the object of a pilgrimage from our Moslem dependencies, and from other Mahommedan countries outside the British Empire. Last year the number of pilgrims from within the Empire was approximately 100,000, the majority coming from India. The interruption of the pilgrimage would cause the most unfavourable reaction there, and in our other Moslem Dependencies, and incidentally a probable access of pro-Turkish and Pan-Islamic sentiment.Nejd lies to the East of, and marches with, the Hejaz. Ibn Saud, its ruler, is the most powerful chief of Arabia from the military point of view, and would probably not have great difficulty in over-running the Hejaz, if hostilities between the two countries were to break out. His followers are coming increasingly under the influence of the Wahabi movement, which may be described as a form of extreme Moslem Puritanism. The tenets of Wahabism induce amongst its adherents a strong215  [3896] &quot; B
tendency towards fanaticism and intolerance, the latter not only directed against everything&quot; Christian and European, but also against the followers of other Moslem sects. A Wahabi occupation of the Holy Places would probably close them effectively to the Pilgrimage from India, Egypt, and the Straits Settlements.A strong rivalry exists between King Hussein and Ibn Saud. Among other points of difference, there remain certain frontier disputes of long standing. No actual hostilities of any importance, however, have taken place since early in 1919. An identic communication was recently sent to the two chiefs, by the Foreign Office and India Office respectively, pressing them to agree to a personal meeting, in the hope that their differences could be thus adjusted. The identic communication pointed out that, in the event of either ruler refusing the invitation to meet his rival, he could not expect a continuance of financial assistance from His Majesty&apos;s Government.Both Hussein and Ibn Saud agreed to such a meeting, and it is hoped that they will come together at Mecca, during the present pilgrimage season, and that some modus vivendi will then be arrived at on the frontier and other questions at issue, and that the danger of a Wahabi occupation of the Holy Places will thus be averted.The subsidies to King Hussein and Ibn Saud were originally purely military measures adopted during the war. The payments to the former were made in connection with his successful revolt against the Turks, during which his troops fought with us in Palestine and Syria, and to the latter to assist him in military operations on ouir behalf during the Mesopotamian campaign.The subsidy to King Hussein has been continued since the Armistice on a reduced scale, in the interests of the pilgrimage. The Hejaz is an unfertile and rocky strip of land whose intrinsic trade and resources are negligible. Its inhabitants outside the towns consist mainly of desert tribes of Bedouin, who are largely beyond the control of the Hejaz Government. The various routes to the Holy Places, including the Hejaz railway itself, lie open to the attacks of these tribes, who, unless overawed or subsidised, are always ready to attack and plunder the caravans of the pilgrims and to cut the railway for the same purpose, and thus render the pilgrimage difficult or impossible. The policy of the Turks during their domination of the Hejaz, was a combination of armed force and&apos;subsidies. They maintained a con-siderable garrison in the Hejaz to overawe the tribes, and supplemented this by the grant of various subsidies to them. In view of the impossibility of maintaining a garrison there, His Majesty&apos;s Government has hitherto paid a monthly grant to the Government of the Hejaz to enable King Hussein to exert some restraint over the Bedouin and keep the pilgrim routes clear. It is believed that the funds received from His Majesty&apos;s Government are largely spent in direct subsidies to the tribal sheikhs.In view of the Hejaz&apos;s membership in the League of Nations, there are obvious objections to the indefinite continuance of this subsidy. It&apos; may eventually be desirable to arrange some form of international loan, to which the various Powers interested in the pilgrimage might subscribe, or to resort to some similar measure. But any action in this sense would be premature, before the peace settlement is effected, and before the question of our special position in Arabia (excluding the Hejaz), which is now being negotiated in Paris, is disposed of.Apart from this aspect of the subsidy question, however, King Hussein has only with great reluctance agreed to meet Ibn Saud. His assent to the meeting is believed to be to some extent due to his apprehension that the subsidy would forth-with cease in the event of a refusal on his part. If His Majesty&apos;s Government were now abruptly to withdraw their financial support there would be considerable risk of the proposed meeting not taking place, and the chance being lost of a satisfactory settlement of the Hejaz-Nejd question.The continuance of this subsidy till the peace settlement is effected, at 250,000 rupees per mensem (the amount recommended by Lord Allenby) is thus clearly necessary if we are to prevent the outbreak of - serious trouble in Arabia, which would react on Islam in general.The payment of a subsidy to the Emir at Nejd has also been continued since the Armistice largely in the interests of the pilgrimage. The Emir is described as being in a permanent state of financial difficulty. His military strength, however, is believed to be adequate to enable him to undertake a successful invasion of the Hejaz on the west or a raid on the south-west portion of Mesopotamia on the east. The opportunities for plunder offered by such expeditions would provide him with an easy and tempting means of replenishing his Treasury. An invasion of the Hejaz by the Wahabis in the early part of the last century resulted in a general massacre of the inhabitants, and such an invasion to-day would in all probability at
least result in the closing of the pilgrimage. The dangers of a raid into Mesopo-tamia are obvious. In the event of a preliminary success, Ibn Saud would probably be joined by the local tribes, who would be ready to seize such a favourable oppor-tunity for plunder, and he might also meet with some support from the Extremist Party in Bagdad and elsewhere. At present, however, Ibn Saud&apos;s attitude to His Majesty&apos;s Government is perfectly friendly, and there is no reason to suppose that he now contemplates any aggression against Mesopotamia.It is hoped to avert the danger of an attack on the Hejaz by the proposed personal meeting between the two rulers. In the meanwhile Ibn Saud is receiving a subsidy of 75,000 rupees per month from Mesopotamian funds. In the event of a satisfactory agreement being reached at his meeting with King Hussein, the question of the reduction of this amount will be open to reconsideration, but till the meeting has taken place any reduction would seem inadvisable.Foreign Office, July 7, 1920.[E 6180/2854/44]Field-Marshal Viscount Allenby to Earl Curzon. (Received June 10.) (No. 559.)My Lord, Cairo, May 28, 1920.I HAVE the honour to submit the following remarks on the question of the grant of subsidies to Arab rulers, with reference to your Lordship&apos;s despatch No. 532 of the 4th May, transmitting the minutes of a meeting held at the Foreign Office on the 17th April, in which I observe that the Treasury are not yet convinced of the necessity for the continuance of the subsidies.It appears to me that to arrive at a just decision on this subject it is necessary in the first place to compare the position of the different rulers now and before the war, to weigh the services of each during that period, to examine whether any responsi-bility rests on His Majesty&apos;s Government for the changes which have occurred, and, finally, to consider whether, on grounds of morality or expediency, it is justifiable to impose on the British taxpayer the burden of providing some or all of them with monetary assistance in the future.The beginning of the war saw an effective, if not entirely efficient, Ottoman administration in the Hejaz and Yemen; Ibn Rashid a mediatised Turkish vassal; the Idrisi in revolt against the ruling powrer, but already discussing terms of peace; and Ibn Saud, who had not long before ejected the Turks from Hasa and Qatif, showing a disposition to resume his allegiance, provided that he was allowed a free hand as Vali of Nejd, and given an adequate stipend. It will be seen that the feeling of racial consciousness, which is now so marked, was already showing itself even in the more remote parts of the Peninsula, but a study of the records of the time will also show that the.Ottoman Government, however unwillingly, was beginning to realise its incapacity to retain by force the Arab countries, and was preparing to grant a measure of self-government which might satisfy the aspirations of its inhabitants.The consideration of the subject was, however, abruptly, broken off by the commencement of the war, and after the Ottoman Government had declared against the Allied Powers, Great Britain, taking advantage of the discontent which already existed, made promise to the Shereef of Mecca, Ibn Saud and the Idrisi, which induced them definitely to cast off their allegiance and throw in their lot with the Allies. I do not propose to examine and compare in detail the services performed by these three rulers, but I think it may fairly be said that each, according to his capacity, rendered real and effective assistance at a time when the result of the war still hung in the balance and, by so doing, brought to nought the plans for a Jehad, diverted or rendered innocuous large Turkish forces, and greatly facilitated our task in keeping open to traffic the Red Sea.It may be said with some show of justice that they have had their reward in gaining their independence and freeing themselves from the Turkish yoke, but the fact must not be lost sight of that, with the removal of the dominant influence, the Arabian Peninsula was left without administrative and financial means or experi-ence for the preservation of order and for the substitution of effective local government in place of what had existed previously.This applies in particular to the Hejaz, and I cannot refrain from thinking that the promises made by His Majesty&apos;s Government impose a certain moral obligation to ensure that the future of these countries&apos;is at least as prosperous as their past.[3896] B 2
I do not, however, wish to press unduly this point, since sentimental considera-tions must give way to those of economy at the present time, and I will pass on to the more practical aspects of the case.As your Lordship is aware, the Arab revolt was not regarded with sympathy either in India or in our other Mahommedan countries. This feeling&apos; itill exists to-day. The revolt can only be justified by its success, and we shall undoubtedly lay ourselves open to severe criticism if the Peninsula passes into a state of anarchy.Further than this, the Allied policy with regard to Syria and Palestine is not in accord with the wishes of the local populations, and has already exposed His Majesty&apos;s Government to a charge of breach of promise and opened the field to Turkish and Bolshevik propaganda from the north.The situation in the Middle East to-day gives rise to grave misgivings, and seems unlikely to improve in the near future. On this account I consider it is of great importance that, if we gain a special position in the Arabian Peninsula, His Majesty&apos;s Government should so employ it as to earn the gratitude of the people and silence the criticism of those detractors, who accuse us of cynicism and self-interest in our treatment of the Arabs.At the present moment we are in a favourable position to achieve this, since the factors which have rendered so restless the Arabs in Syria and Mesopotamia have not operated with any great force in the Peninsula itself, and its rulers, with the excep-tion of the Imam Yahyn and the new Emir of Hail, who has in point of fact come under the influence of Ibn Saud, have given satisfactory proofs that they are prepared to look to us for help and guidance and protection.The questions then arise whether we can gain our object without payment, and, if not, whether the results achieved will justify the expenditure.As regards the former point I consider that the experience of the last four years shows the answer to be emphatically in the negative. I do not advocate any undue interference in the internal and local affairs of the Peninsula, but I presume that we shall attempt to adjust the relations between the different rulers and claim to influence all foreign relations, and it is only reasonable to suppose that the rulers will require some quid fro quo. Furthermore, moral influence has its effect in the East, but it will not always prove such a strong deterrent as the threat to cut off supplies, more especially in countries which are far removed from civilisation and where it is impossible to achieve a purpose by armed force.I do not think it is too much to say that if we attempt to gain a predominant influence in Arabia without being prepared to pay for it our efforts will result in failure.As regards the advantages to be gained, I place, first and foremost, the ehancs of recovering and maintaining our prestige in the Middle East.&quot;We have destroyed the Power which, however badly, ruled Arabia. We must put something in its place, and, in so doing, endeavour to re-establish our good name for disinterestedness and sympathy with Moslem races. We are, and shall continue to be, hampered in Syria and Palestine. It is, therefore, the more necessary to seize, our opportunity in the Peninsula where the conditions are favourable and where we shall not be exposed to foreign rivalry once our special position is recognised.Secondly, there is considerable evidence to show that a determined effort is being made to unite Islam against all European Powers. A friendly Arabia will be an important check to this.Thirdly, it is necessary to have a friendly population in the countries-bordering our vital sea routes.Equal to these in importance is the necessity ot keeping open the pilgrimage routes to the Holy Places and of ensuring that the pilgrimage itself is undertaken.We are under judgment of the Moslems in all parts of the world in this matter, and failure will do us incalculable harm.-Fifthly, I would place the advantages to British trade which the opening up of the interior of the Peninsula will afford, and sixthly, the desirability of preventing other Powers from gaining a predominant position, more especially in South-west Arabia.I trust that the above considerations will be sufficient to show that the advantages to be won are not small, and that, in the event of His Majesty&apos;s Government being-granted a special position there, the necessity of affording monetary assistance, until such time as the different countries can make their own way, will be recognised&apos;.I understand that it may be difficult for His Majesty&apos;s Government to provide all the money, and that joint subsidies or loans may be necessary. This would be unfortunate from a British point of view, but it would not alter the principle which
I am endeavouring to lay down. It would merely mean that the responsibility, and therefore the credit, to be gained would be collective. I am unaware of the reasons which call for a joint loan, and should have thought that the subsidies granted to the rulers of Bahrein, Musqat, and Koweit by the Government of India before the war would &apos; have furnished a useful precedent in. claiming the sole right to give monetary assistance now.I do not advocate the permanent continuance of subsidies on the present scale, and I would gradually replace them with stipends and loans.. All the rulers, with perhaps the exception of Ibn Rashid, possess sea ports or tracts of land or other resources which are capable of development, and I consider that loans should be granted where there, seems a good prospect of a productive return and where security can be offered.Stipends should, I think, be granted to King Husein, Ibn Saud and the Idrisi. The case of Ibn Rashid is of relative unimportance, while that of the Imam Fuhya is still so obscure that it is idle to consider it now. Eventually we shall probably find it cheaper to pay than to fight. ;I also consider that certain conditions should be attached, such as the main-tenance of internal peace, acceptance of our control of foreign relations, and the keeping open of the trade and pilgrimage routes. These would doubtless be embodied in the form of a treaty with each ruler.With regard to Mr. Phillip!s suggestion that it might be more satisfactory to &quot; back one ruler only,&quot; I would observe that it has already become evident that the ideal of subsidising the various chiefs through one overlord is an impossible one. There is no ruler who would be accepted by the remainder as paramount, and there is none who could be trusted to make the right distribution of the funds. King Husein, whom, no doubt, Mr. Phillips had in mind, has indeed proved the least likely to be accepted as suzerain and to endeavour to bolster him up as Grand King of Arabia, by paying, other subsidies through him, would be a politically unsound, if not an actually dangerous, policy to adopt.The question as to the amounts of the stipends and loans is one which requires further consideration, and in this despatch I have not attempted to do more than lay before your Lordship the broad considerations which, in. my opinion, justify the adoption of the principle that their payment in the future is an investment which is necessary, and which will bring in its due return.,A copy of this despatch&apos; is being sent to the Resident, Aden, the Civil Commissioner, Bagdad, and to the Foreign Department, Delhi.I have, &amp;c.ALLENBY, F.M.o
