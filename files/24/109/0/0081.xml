This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.SECRET.Referred toCommittee of Home(ITHE CABINET.GOVERNMENT MARKS BILL.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF-STATE FOR WAR.I circulate, for the approval of the Cabinet, a draft Bill dealing with the problem of the unauthorized application of Government marks. This Bill was framed before the war, and the experience of the departments purchasing Government stores during the war gave further illustrations of the necessity for such a Bill. The offence which it creates is the application to goods without lawful authority or excuse of certain specified Government marks in such manner as to induce belief that the goods have been accepted or tested by the Government. Cases occurred during the war in the experience of the Ministry of Munitions in which the stamps used by Government Examiners in passing goods when accepted,, were improperly applied by contractors.The Bill also makes it an offence to be in possession, without lawful authority, of dies or other appliances by which the marks in question could be produced. It will be noted that the offence of unlawfully applying Government marks in so far as it leads to misleading or deceiving a person in the employment of the Government, might be brought under the more general terms of the Prevention of Frauds (Government Contracts) Bill, but it is considered advisable to deal with it specifically in this Bill, which protects the marks by applying to them the provisions of the Merchandise Marks Act.w. s. c.77155452The Was Office,23rd July, 1920.(B20/263)  100  7/20  H&amp;S  8274wo
