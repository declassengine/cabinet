(This document Is the. property of His Britannic Ma^oofcy^a &amp;mrrrawat)SUPPLY MD TRANSPORT COMMIT TEEMemorandum by the Minister of Labour.KCRETA short time ago, in connection with reports which had appeared in tho pross of a threatened strike of employees of the Metropolitan water Board, the Minister of Transport circulated a letter in-which ho dealt with the question of tho position of tho Supply and Transport Committee in relation to a strike of this character as compared with a strike which might bo regarded as amounting to a &quot;national emergency&quot;.The history of the Supply and Transport Committee is some-*what involved, but as I understand it tho schemes whioh have been worked out under the auspicos of that Committee are now in a fairly-complete state of preparation.   I have just circulated to my colleagues a memorandum dealing with the present Industrial. . -..situation in which I hare indicated that there are possibilities of a breakdown in the relationship beiween Capital and Labour in one or more of the big trades of the country.   I hope that it may be possible to avoid any such breakdown, but in this connection I should like to obtain a decision as to the action, if any, which is to be taken by the Supply and Transport Committee in the event of -trouble arising*   The not unnatural concern as to tis position displayed by the Minister of Transport on the occasion of the threatened strike of the Metropolitan Water Board employees dis-oloses the faot that no definite arrangement appears to exist whereby an authoritative decision may be obtained as to whether the I      moment has arrived at whioh the machinery under the control of the Supply and Transport Committee is to be put into motion.   It is I- 1 - - . &quot; V&apos;&apos;&apos; -   /think&apos;SS/7A556.
VVA556\i;&quot;y */\ -think important that this point should he cleared up et once* I infer that it is the view of Sir Eric Geddes that the reponsiblilty ought not to rest with him.   I agree; nor *ught it to rest with me or any other individual Minister.   The machinery is of such a character and Its operations nay have such far-reaching effeota that it ought not to he put in motion except with the collective aansent of   the Cabinet.It is my duty as the Minister of labour to try, by means of conciliation, to prevent, fce far as possible, a wide-spread oonflict between employers and employed, and clearly when negotiations are in progress a premature attempt to put into operation, even in a preliminary or partial way, the arrangements whioh have been worked out by the Supply and Transport Committee, maybe disastrous in its results upon the negotiations.I would ask, therefore, that it be made clear that the responsibility for deciding at what moment, if at all, the operations of the Supply and Transport Committee are to begin rosts upon the Cabinet, and that no action will be taken until the Cabinet has met til lie authorised the sotion.(initd.)   $ J.
