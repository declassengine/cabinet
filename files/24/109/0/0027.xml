r THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY Off HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENT).C *P*1626 *C 1 B I K B T.THREATENED STRIKE 0? IvIEIBERS 0? THE ELECTRICAL(Memorandum by the First Commissioner of Works.)I havo seen a copy of the memorandum by tho Ministeragreement with the points raised, but I think it should be pointed otrb that if, as a result of the Postmaster GeneralTrades Union, they take aggressive action, tho effect of such aotion jsould extend far beyond tho Post office services. v At .the present time the ventilation and light -ing of the House of Commons and the Courts of Justice would be chiefly affected and it might be possiblo to doal with such an emergency for a short time without considerable inconvenience^   but the strike, if decided on,, would probably be deferred until later in the year when the lighting of all Government offices and Publio Buildings and general communal services would be involved.   A more serious aspect of \he matter from the point of view of my Department is that our future relations with the Electrical Trades Union, with whom we constantly-have to deal, may be affected, and it is also somewhat inconsistent for one Department to recognise a Union which another Department does not.As regards the claim that the rates paid by the Offioo of iTorks are higher than those paid by the General Post Office, our electricians are paid the trade rato of 2s*3d.fCP. 1598.of Labour in regard to the above.I am in general
per hour, but it is extremely difficult to make a comparison owing to the difference in the nature of the work on which thet mon are employed, and to varying&apos; conditions in regard to leave and sick pay.I think every,effort should bo made to avoid giving the Electrical&apos; Trades Union reasonable causo for ambarjcing on what might prove to be a serious strike..(Signed)     ALIBIED MOUD,.July 15, 1920.
