JtM^J&apos; -   41?fi-MiXs document is the ..P.R0Pffi Y OF his BBlM-H.16&apos; JMfifSlY16 MVE&amp;WOT 1SE0.EE ft. ;&apos;:.(  : Copy Ho.P .-1688.- &apos;t .   irI^h  . situationiMemo: by the Chief Secretary covering a Draft Bill providing for the immediate extension - of the jurisdiction of Court Martial.1.,      As desired by the Cabinet I submit ray proposals in regard to the further statutory powers immediately required to meet the present situation in Ireland.   The provisions which I recommend, have bean embodied in a Bill of which I aeauax a first draftv2.   &quot;&apos; It isnecessary %ur recognise the fact that throughout the greater part      Ireland criminal justice can no longer be administered by the ordinary constitutional process of trial by judge, and jury..At the recent assizes the criminal business of many of the counties1 of the south and west was left undisposed of owing to the non-attendance of jurers and when a jury can be got together even in the clearest oases a conviction is not assured.   This is the result of a campaign of intimidation and violence carefully planned and vigorously, executed.    If the campaign were&apos; confined t&amp;/-the intimidation of jwrs a remedy might be found in the, suspension of trial by jury, and the   , establishment of special tribunals, of two or more judges as was dona in 1882 but the violence and intimidation extendsts all officers concerned in tfce administration of justice, Clerks of the Crown, Magistrates, Petty sessions ,Clerks, Sheriffs, Process-servers and Bailiffs; Courthouses are burnt down and court records are destroyed.   The administrative machinery cf the Courts has been brought to a standstill.

Regulations thereunder ....   The advantage of this cours,e&apos; is that no new legislation would be required, . the dfsau.vantages are:   that the death penalty cannot be imposed upon a person&apos; convicted, by. a court martial of..an offence against the. Regulations (unless.it is-proved, that the offence was committed with the intention of-assisting the enemy) and that the Regulations are war Regulations and do not at present extend, to ordinary crime.(b) By exercising the eommon law.right - of the Crown,to take such measures as may be necessary, for. restoring peace and order-in the case of invasion. .or . insurrection  . For this purpose immediate legislation would, not be necessary, but.,, pending the- passing of an 4c t- &apos;pf&apos;. Indemnity 4- the jurisdiction of the courts martial established&apos; :u ,exe?:-c3se: of the, power would be liable to be   chaliengod in the. civil--courts- and it would rest with-the&apos; persons relying upon that;, jurisdiction to prove that -a state of : rebellion or insurrection pievailed. A proclamation of martial law would; be evidence of .this,  but it is open to quest!..n whether it would be conclusive (see Re Marais., 1902&apos;, A.C., 109), . - -  .Y(m 4(c)   By legislation on the lines of 3 &amp; 4,/ 0, 4, an .- -Act passed in 1883&apos;,   &apos;fhat .;*ct empowered the Lord lieutenant and any general or other; officer&apos; commanding a district to establish courts martial for the trial of persons charged withsuch
such offences within the district as fehey may be diieetsd, to try by the Lord Lieutenant or officer.   The prosecutions were to be conducted by persons authorised by the Lord Lieutenant, and on each trial a sergeant at law or barrister appointed by the Lord Lieutenant was to ,aot as a judge advocate.Amongst the offences triable by courts martial were Unite-boy effences, curfew offences, unauthorised possession of arms or ammunition, injury or intimidation of jurors, etc (ss. 13-37$.   It is to be noted, however, that the courts martial were not competent to impose punishment of death (s. 21).   2&apos;he disadvantage of this course is that it would set up a second system of courts martial in Ireland in addition to the system now in operation there. Under the first system offences against the regulations would be dealt with whilst civil crimes would be dealt with under the seoond system.   In eaoh case the procedure constitution and jurisdiction of courts martial would be different and the two systems would inevitably lead to confusion,   ihirther the Bill for the purpose would be long and contain many formidable provisions.
! i ; n    420-    (d)   By taking-advantage of tho Defence of the Re alia Cede as at present in operation in Ireland, and by extending and adapting that Code to the conditions now prevailing there.    This seems to bo far the most con-&quot; veniftnt course, both from the parliamentary and administrative point o.&apos;: view, and a draft   Bill .had been preparod on these lineg.4.     The main provision of the Bill is that all 6rimes under the ordinary law are to be deemed offences against the Defence of the Realm Regulations, and the effect of this provision is to attract tho procedure and machinery of the Defence of the Realm Acts and Regulations, with the result that every person charged with a crime in Ireland can be brought to trial before a court martial or court of summary jurisdiction and be dealt with by those courts i:i the same way as offenders against the Regulations are new dealt with by them,Tho Bill makes one express modification of the Acts and. Regulations.-    At present.the punishment that may be imposed by a court martial for an offence against the Regulations is penal servitude or any lesser punishment, except where it is proved that the offence was committed with the intention of assisting the onemy, in which case the death penalty may be imposed.     The Bill, however, proposes that where a person is convicted by a court martial of a crimo the punishment is to be the punishment which may be inflicted for that crime under the ordinary law.     Thus, the death penalty could be imposed on a person convicted by a court martial of treason or murder, but in no other case.It is not intended that courts martial are to supersede the criminal courts in all&apos;cases.   The ordinary court &amp;till operates satisfactorily in carts of Ireland, and as con-   sditions improve it may be possible to revert to normal procedure/
Tproceduro-gradually.   So far as the Bill is oi,wcpo*l it makes it olear that tho liability to trial and pvinishment according to the ordinary law is not abolished by the Bill* The procedure for determining whether a particular offender is to be tried under the Code, or by a civil court under the ordinary law is a matter far regulations.    The pew or to mafce regulations under the Defence of the Realm Acts is extended by the Bill so as to authoriso regulations for the restora-tion of poaco and order in Ireland and otherwise for tho purposes&apos; of the Bill, and it is expressly provided that this extended power may bo exercised at any time up to the end of twelve months from the termination of the war.   It is to be noted that the existing regulations have been continued up to that timo by tho War Emergency laws (Continuance)     Act, 1920.It may be neoessary to make new regulations in consoquenc of the new classes of offences brought by the Bill within the cognisance of courts martials and it may also be necessary to amend some of the existing regulations in their application to Ireland.   Under the existing law (Army Act, s. 126) the procedure for punishing witnesses for refusing to attend at, or to give evidenco before, a court martial is not suited to present conditions in Ireland,     The powers for theso pur-poses are exorciseablo, not by the court- martial, but by a civil court on a certificate of the president of the court martial.     It is desired that theso powers should be exer-ciaeable. by the court martial&apos;itself.     This would best be secured., by regulations;   and ss it is a question whether this is possible under the Bill as drafted, the terms of sub-section &apos;&amp; of clauso 1 will require reconsideration.The;&apos; regulation making po-.,er under the Bill will include power by; Order in. Council to. create new &amp;ffQaaa*3G.g., to maice membership of such organisations as the Irish Republican Brotherhood an offence in itself.   As the law
stands an fcffonco cannot be established.. without &quot;proof, -of some act done in furtherance of the purposes of the unlawful association.(Signed)     mr.&apos; GE3E2TWOOD.irish office, s.v?.24th July, 1920.
