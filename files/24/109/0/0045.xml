OUT OF 1crk DONATION.Memorandum by the Minister of Labour.The special extension of donation to ex-service men now in operation comes to an end on July 51st, and it Is necessary to decide at once whether any further extension is to be made.Ex-service men have been entitled to a considerable amount of donation already.   The scheme began on the . 25th November, 1918.   Under the original policies issued to them on discharge they are entitled within the twelve months after discharge to an initial period of 26 weeks at 29s, a week plus allowances for dependent children and a further 13 weeks (or in the case of disabled men 20 weeks) at 20Q.a week plus children&apos;s allowances.There have been two special extensions, the first operating from 26th November, 1919, to 31st March, 1920, within Yfhich period ex-service men were entitled to draw 9 weeks &quot;at 20s a week without children^ allowances and the second special extension from 1st April to 51st July, 1920, during which period they were entitled to a further 12 weeks at 20s. a week without children1s allowances.It has thus been possible in extreme cases for as much as 60 weeks (or in the case of disabled men 67 weeks) of donation to be dra^n in tha 20 months from the beginning of November, 1918, to the end of July, 1920..  It cannot be said, therefore, that the State has so far been illiberal in its government.
treatment, of the ex-service man.If there is no further extension, the only ex-service men who will he entitled to donation after 51st -ally will he those who have been demobilised for less than a year and have not exhausted their donation payable during the, year after demobilisation.   The result would be that, assuming the general state of employment to remain as at present, about 60,000 men will be deprived of donation on 51st July and about 85,000 will remain on donation^,   (&quot;To the 60,000 here referred to must be added a considerable number of men who have   already exhausted their right to out of work dojn&amp;tion and are still unemployed.) , Although the rate of unemployment among men who were demobilised over 12 months ago is low (about 1,5/?&apos;), It would be quite wrong to base any argument respecting the 60,000 upon this fact. The amount of unemployment is very unevenly spread over the country, and of the 60,000 who it is estimated would be deprived of donation, practically.one half are located in 11 principal towns as under:-I0u remaining No,deprivedon donation. ofcTonation. .........-........&quot; &apos;------London,&apos;.......      24,700 15,800Liverpool ......        2,575 1,875Glasgow .......        2,280 1.775Bri sbol.......        1,570 1.700Belfast .......        1.570 1,700Dublin......c        1,140 1.450Plymouth &amp; Devonrort.        1,470 950Portsmouth.&apos;.....        1,660 700Manchester. . .     .           1,425 850Corko     .......           615 1,575Edinburgh ......        1,140 750Total. 59,545 28,925Ps already stated to the final column must be added in each oase the number of those who have already exhausted their out of work donation and are still unemployed...2.   I,
jn Ireland, there vrj.ll he, according to present inlieatIons, 7,4^0 men remaining on donation and 10,000 deprived of donation on 51st July.(Of course the foregoing figures deal only with ex-service        in receipt of out of work donation .   Our Employment Exchange registers show the total number.of men registered with us as unemployed in the United Kingdom as  42,000 - a figure which includes, besides ex-service men still on donation, a n\imber of civilians, and ex-service men whose donation rights are exhausted but who are still registered, as unemployed.)As regards all those for whom, as at present arranged donation has been announced to cease, on 51st July, It is no doubt broadly true that the great bulk of them are unskilled menc   come of them no doubt have not been very active in their endeavour to find, work,   I am driven to this conclusion by the extent to,which Local Employment Committees have suspended and refused donation.   On the other hand, neither can it be denied, that, in the great centres particularly, the unskilled market is already practically   full; and men who have endeavoured to find work have not succeeded, and, so far as j. can see, will not succeed, in doing so,   Ho doubt their chances would be improved if they were prepared to go farther afield, in their search for work.   But this, again, is practically out of the question so far as the married men are concerned, because of the housing difficulty.   I have put to my colleagues before, and nor&apos; repeat, that the residuum of ex-service men unemployed with which we are now confronted cannot be seriously affected except bv a material extension
in the trades in which it is Possible, of a system ^hioh has, happily, already been adopted, to a comparatively slight extent,   1 mean a system under which firms are prepared to take numbers of these-men in, with the consent of the Trade Unionists, and by a short course of practical instructional work enable thom to reach some silage at any rate of semi-skilled status.   Rut I am afraid one material extension here contemplated will not he possible without a measure of Btate assistance.Having regard to the grave difficulties with which the Chancellor of the Exchequer is confronted, and also the extent to which these men have already been &apos;assisted, I can very well believe that my colleagues may feel compelled in the cases of these men, generally, to refuse further extension.If they do, it is my duty to warn them that such a course, - however defensible and however inevitable   - will not he pursued without risk of considerable &quot;disturbance in parts of London and in the other great cities already mentioned.But whatever may be the decision in the matter of the single man, I am bound to plead for an extension of the. donation to -(a) disabled men, i,e, men with  0^ or more disability;(b) married men;(c) Men with dependent children under 15 years of age; And further, that the exiension in these cases should be for ej-:ht weeks donation at 20s, a week to be drawn within the period of 14 weeks from 1st August to 8th November, The special extension at present in operation applies
to ex-service women and merchant seamen as well as to ex-service men.   The numbers affected are small, and. Iapply equally to ex-service women and to merchants seamen who are disabled, or married, or have dependent children under 15*The date 8th November is chosen because it is the date proposed for the coming into force of the Unemployment..^ Insurance Bill,I have considered the possibility of limiting the proposed extension to men who have served overseas.   But I have come to the conclusion that we could not impose this limitation now,,It will be necessary to review the position before8th November in order to determine what, if any, arrangements *should be made to deal with the cases of men who will not be eligible for benefit under the new BillrI ought to warn the Cabinet that there Is and will be considerable agitation in favour of continuing the out of work donation to all ex-service men until at any rate a general scheme of unemployment insurance Is in effective operation,I propose also to remind the Local Employment Committees - of their duty to carry out thoroughly the instructions under ?rhich they are to suspend or withdraw payment of donation to men who are not making endeavourto find employment * As to cost:-(1)   With no extension beyond.

I will presently submit a Paper on that.   Assuming that the Cabinet shut down the donation for single men, amongst the number who would be put off donation by this policy are a number of extremely reckless individuals. Practically the whole of the men now on the out of work donation, except those more recently demobilised, are unskilled - men who were in their teens or early twenties when war broke out; and are now from 20 to 30 years of age. Flsewhere I have pointed out that they will remain in each great centre of population a continuing source of discontent
Ministry of Labour,(Initialled)   Tt J..M,17.7,20,unless something is done by a short intensive course of training and workshop experience to up-grade them to semi-skilled status.These men are eagerly exploited by the Socialist organisations which pass from Passivisnv and Conscientious Objection to ardent advocacy of the claim of the Ex-Fighter with the greatest ease.   To-day these organisations are working the Cost of Living: Increased Rents: and prospective Increased. Railway Fares) for all they are worth.   To add at this moment nearly 16^000 ex-service men in London to the number of those unf^Ployed an^- with no income at all: nearly 2,000 in Liverpool, Glasgow, Bristol and Belfast: over a thousand in Dublin and Cork: and round about a thousand in Plymouth, Portsmouth, Manchester and Edinburgh: is a proposition not to be entered upon lightly,   especially when it is remembered that already in each of these centres-there is quite a considerable number of men of the type-- of which I am sneaking already unemployed and with no income -having already run out of the out of work donation,I outfht to advise the Cabinet that I am receiving representations in favour of a continuance of the out of work donation for all ex-service men-
