j    p y^,v[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.,]Printed for the Cabinet.  July 1920.CONFIDENTIAL. C.P.-1654.NOTE BY THE FOREIGN OFFICE ON THE FINANCIAL RELATIONS OF THE WAR OFFICE WITH THE EGYPTIAN GOVERNMENT,Memorandum by the Secretary of State foe Foreign Affairs.THE Secretary of State for War recently (25th June) circulated a paper&apos;2&apos; to the Cabinet in which the views of the War Office were set forth on the above important but very delicate subject&quot;. In the course of a covering memorandum he remarked that its discussion and settlement were.matters, not for his Department, but for the Cabinet. Agreeing with this opinion, I circulate a note which states the Foreign Office point of view, and deprecates the raising of. this issue with the Egyptian Government at the present time.C. of K.July 13, 1920.Memorandum on the Financial Relations of the War Office with theEgyptian Government.1. In his memorandum of the 25th June the Secretary of State for War, after expressing the opinion that the present fixed contribution of 150,0001 per annum from the Egyptian Government to armyfunds is out of. date and inadequate, goes on to raise two questions for the Cabinet to decide : firstly, the maximum amount of money which can be extorted from Egypt; and,!secondly, whether the present is an opportune ime to discuss the subject.2. From the Foreign Office point of view the question of opportunity is clearly of greater moment than that of amount, and all that will be urged in support of that point, of view applies with equal force, to the revision of the annual fixed contribution.3. To deal seriatim with the five heads under which the&apos;War Office claims are discussed, there is but little to be added.to the statement A with regard to Egypt&apos;s financial contribution to the war. The spontaneous action of the Council of Ministers in assuming the burden of the suspense account towards the close of the financial year 1817-18 involved the sacrifice of the whole of the estimated budget surplus. As this surplus was due, not so much to the excess of income over expenditure as to the impossibility of spending money on maintenance and renewals, for which fresh provision now has to be made, the Council of Ministers were in effect mortgaging the resources of their Government in order to contribute to the cost of Imperial military operations from which they had definitely been promised immunity. They did so fully realising the consequences of their policy.4. But the direct contribution in cash by no means exhausts the list of services rendered ungrudgingly to the military authorities, for the whole machinery of Govern-ment was to an ever-increasing extent placed at their disposal, and officials, both British and native, undertook work far removed from their normal administrative duties in order to assist the maintenance in the field of the British, army.5. The extract from the Financial Adviser&apos;s report on the Budget 1920-21 is scarcely germane to the discussion, for any cash contribution which has been, or may in the future be, made by Egypt must be drawn from the funds of the Government, and these are, and must remain, circumscribed by ,the practical impossibility of raising additional revenue. This can only be done by the imposition of fresh taxation, which is, however, not possible so long as the Capitulations are in force and their* C.P.-1536.[3897]
abolition contingent on the assent of twelve Capitulatory Powers who will certainly cling obstinately to their privileges.6. The second claim under section B of the War Office Memorandum is in respect of the additional charges incurred through the civil disturbances of 1919. It is impossible for anyone mathematically to apportion the degree of blame to be attached to Bis Majesty&apos;s Government and the Egyptians respectively for these events. But, in any case, it is unreasonable to base on them an attempt to charge Egypt with the whole of the difference between the cost of the actual army of occupation during 1919 and the cost of the pre-war army.7. It is further out of the question that we should impose a heavy fine on Egypt as a punishment for these disoiders, seeing that they were merely a feature of political conditions which we have implicitly recognised to be such as to require change. A demand so heavy and so arbitrary as that now proposed could only be in place in dealing with a defeated aggressor. It would be in the highest degree impolitic to make it at the very moment when negotiations are in progress with a view to settling the future political status of Egypt on a basis which, by commanding the assent of the most influential native elements, will, it is hoped, restore tranquillity to that country and thereby enable us to reduce the army of occupation to pre-war strength, or even below it. Such a reduction would save us many millions in the future. The attempt may fail, but its failure would be converted into a certainty by the imposition of a crushing penalty as one of the terms of the contemplated settlement.8. With regard to Section C, the war gratuities to British personnel with the Egyptian army, it is thought that the War Office have misinterpreted a statement by the Financial Adviser to the Egyptian Government, who, in explaining the impossibility of accepting such a charge on the Egyptian Budget, pointed out that the payment of such gratuities to British officers from Egyptian funds would inevitably entail a payment on a similar scale to native officers and men, and that this would involve a sum of 250,000Z. and be beyond the resources at the disposal of the Government. It is therefore unlikely that the gratuities due to British officers and men amount to more than a small fraction of the figure quoted.9. With regard to Section D, Egypt&apos;s annual contribution to army funds, it is admitted that conditions have entirely altered since the figure of 150,000L was fixed in J 907, but, quite apart from the considerations of expediency urged in paragraph 7 of this memorandum, it would at the present moment be impossible to forecast the strength and nature of the military force wliich, for strategic reasons of an Imperial nature, it may be necessary to maintain in Egypt six months hence, nor is it a simple matter to decide the proportion of such a force which is required solely to protect Egypt from foreign aggression and to secure the maintenance of good order in that country, and manifestly it would be unfair to charge Egypt with anything beyond such a proportion.10. If, however, it proves possible to negotiate an agreement under which our presence in the country would no longer provoke the hostility of its inhabitants, it is clear that the army of occupation could substantially be reduced, and it is probable that the Egyptian Government, no longer suspicious of our policy, would approach this very contentious and provocative question in a spirit of far greater cordiality than could be hoped for at the present juncture.11. There remains Section E, the customs dues charged in respect of army imports into Egypt, which is at present under discussion with the War Office, who have been invited to go into the question fully with the Financial Adviser and the Director-General of the Egyptian Customs Administration next month. This is a matter of purely domestic concern, and there is no reason to suppose that a satisfactory solution should prove difficult of attainment.12. In conclusion, it may be said that the Foreign Office are convinced that any attempt, whether now or in the future, to extort a heavy capital contribution from the Egyptian Government would not only in itself prove abortive, but would inevitably destroy all chances of friendly co-operation, and so actually increase the cost of upholding our position in Egypt instead of diminishing it. On the other hand, a reconsideration of the annual contribution towards army funds must await the conclusion of an arrangement with Egypt which will place our presence in that country on an accepted and constitutional basis.
