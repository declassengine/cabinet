This OocHnie.it is the Pi operty pL His BrilahP.ic Maift3tv&apos;s governmentTHE CABINET.SITUATION IN MESOPOTAMIA.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR The situation in Mesopotamia has come to a head.1. A division from India has been ordered to Basra costing millions. All prospect of reduction is at au end. A very large supplementary estimate is inevitable.2. General Haldaae must have full discretion to concentrate his troops so as to form strong forces with adequate reserves capable of crushing all opposition between Baghdad and the sea.3. He may be forced to draw troops first from Mosul because it is much nearer and quicker to come from there than from Kasvin in Persia. He must do whatever the urgency of the military situation requires. If, however, he has an option, from which place should he withdraw first Mosul or Persia ? We should instruct him on this point without delay.4. About 400 casualties have so far been incurred on the Lower Euphrates. Rumaitha contains about 500 troops and civilians and may easily fall.Whatever the future policy may be, the rising on the Lower Euphrates should be stamped out with the utmost vigour.Basra to Baghdad is the stem of the tree, and if the stem is cut through all the spreading branches, whether to Mosul or Persia, will wither. It is much better to lose a few branches than have the stem severed.w. s. c.17th My, 1920.(B20/825)  100 7/20 H&amp;S  8411-two
This document is the property of His Britannic Majestys Government,THE CABIN KT.SUMMARY OP THE SITUATION IN MESOPOTAMIA.I, The situation will be seen in paper entitled the &quot;Situation on the Euphrates.&quot;2. Briefly, hostile Arab tribes have cut the laihvay between Basrah and Baghdad and are holding the line, the garrison of Rumaitha is being besieged and the relieving forces have not been able to dislodge these Arabs or relieve Rumaitha. About 400 casualties have been sustained by the compartively small British-Indian forces engaged. The General Officer Commanding, Mesopotamia, states that he has used his last reserves and it is essential that a further reserve should be formed.3. At present a division of three brigades is under orders to proceed from India as soon as possible, but it is unlikely that these troops will begin to land before at least two weeks. Their arrival will be spread over four or five weeks. It will take at least another week to put each unit into action up-country.The question is how to provide other troops as soon as possible. To decide where they should be taken from it is necessary to briefly examine the situation generally.(a.) The French have practically declared war on Feisal and it is the British policy to remain neutral.(i.) If Feisal is defeated he will probably join the Turks and attack us in the Mosul area.(ii.) If he wins he will be forced by his followers to try conclusions with us in Mesopotamia,(iii.) In either (i.) or (ii.) the Bedouin tribes will be out to give us as much trouble as possible in Mesopotamia and Palestine.(iv.) Feisal may proclaim &quot;Jehad&quot; and exhort Moslems to attack us whenever they can.We may, therefore, expect an increase of our difficulties from this Franco-Arab war.- (6.) The Turkish Nationalists, in neighbourhood of Diabekr and Nisibin, have not attracted much attention lately, but they&quot; are a potential danger and may always combine with, the Kurds. (c.) On Mesopotamia^ right flank is Persia, and at present Norperforce, which consists of about two brigades, including lines of communication troops reaches, as &apos;ar as Manjil, 53 miles from Resht, protecting Mesopotamia, and giving moral support to the Persian Government.Persia is threatened by a Russian invasion from the North, but at present this consists of Kuchuk Khan and his Persian Bolsheviks, inspired and encouraged from Moscow.The Persian gendarmerie under Starosselski is being employed to guard the capital. It is not impossible that he and his Russian Cossacks will join with the Bolsheviks in attacking our small force from the rear. i5. We find, therefore, we are threatened with possible trouble from the west, the north and east. All the alternatives are disagreeable. Withdrawal from the Upper Euphrates will no doubt encourage Arab aggression in that quarter.Withdrawal from Mosul will entail the entire loss of that vilayet, which will fall into the power of Kurds and Turks. The mere operation of retreat is itself full of danger, and it is quite likely that we should be closely followed up.Withdrawal from Persia will lower our prestige in that country, but will leave a Russian gendarmerie to defend the Shah while the majority of Norperforce will be at the disposal of General Officer Commanding, Mesopotamia, for operations in that country.6. If it is decided to withdraw Norperforce or any part of it from Kasvin to railhead Qaritu.(l30 miles from Baghdad), it is calculated that by using the motor transport now in use on the Persian,road one battalian could be withdrawn in 11 days, two battalions in 14 days and a mixed brigade in 22 days.
The Situation on the Lower Euphrates July, 1920.No. 6643 Early in June it was  reported by the Civil Commissioner, Baghdad, that(c.c), unsuccessful efforts were being made at Kerbela and Najaf to work up popular feeling 4.6.20,^ against the mandates. Later in the month grave troubles were thought to be (c c impending at Kerbela, and the situation at Najaf, Diwaniyah and Nasiriyah, where the18.6.&apos;20. tribes apparently contemplated a reversion to their former lawless state, became difficult. No. 7760 On the 22nd of June the unrest in Kerbela culminated in the arrest of the ring(c.c), leaders, whose aim appeared to be the creation of anarchy to be followed by the 26.6.20.    restoration of Turkish sovereignity.   The Civil Commissioner reported that this action had had a satisfactory effect upon the tribes generally, but that at Najaf and in theNasiriyah divisions a certain amount of unrest prevailed. No. X i)303,      On 1st July tribesmen attacked the Government prison at Rumaitah, killed the 4.7.20.     Arab guard, and forcibly released a sheikh who had been imprisoned there for sedition.It is believed that this outrage was instigated at Najaf.On the following day the tribe rose and cut railway and telegraph above and belowRumaitha and below Samawah.   Considerable lengths of railway line were torn up. On 3rd July, one train from Basrah with 100 rifle reinforcements reached Samawah,but an armoured train from Basrah following with additional 100 rifles was attacked, &apos; and its engine was derailed about 12 miles south-east of Samawah.   After casualties had been inflicted on Arabs, this train was taken back to El Khidr.   The same day one company of Indian infantry from Hillah reached Rumaitha and reinforcements fromBaghdad including field and mountain guns reached Diwaniyah.On 3rd July aerial reconnaissances reported  that a considerable number of .  tribesmen were destroying the railway line and were burning an important bridgesome 5 miles north of Samawah.The General Officer Commanding, Mesopotamian Expeditionary Force, reports thatas the Tigris River line is open, the supply situation is causing no anxiety. No. X 9315,       Considerable damage u as done to the railway, which was torn up in many places 5.7.20.     between Rumaitha and Samawah.   The station at Rumaitha was damaged by fire, andthe bridge south of it was destroyed and many barricades were erected on the railway. Action was taken against a large camp of 250 tents 7 miles west of Samawah,which was bombed and machine-gunned effectively. No. X 9349, On 6th July, the situation at Rumaitha was reported to be serious and at Khidr as 7.7.20. being &quot;not so good.&quot; A relief column (4 companies infantry and i section mountain X 9356, artillery) arrived 6 miles inrth of Rumaitha, but sustained considerable casualties and 7.7.20. was 0t)ligecl t0 return to Immah Hanza. 29 miles north-west of Rumaitha. No. X 9376, The General Officer Commanding, Baghdad, is sending one infantry brigade and 9.7.20.     Held artillery to Diwaniyah, and in view of the possibility of a general rising on theMiddle and Lower Euphrates, he asks for a brigade and a field battery to be held in readiness in India for despatch at shortest notice.   War Office have asked that one division may be held in readiness in India.On 8th July a supply train returning to Diwaniyah was derailed and set on fire.An armoured train and a repair train from Ur reached Habdah (about 4 miles fromSamawah).. The political situation in Shamiyah district is reported to be delicate. No. X 9348,      On 9th July an armoured train from Khidr reached Samawah, and the enemy, who 10.7.20.   were destroying the railway at Habdah, were driven off with casualties.   On the same day our aeroplanes were active and were fired on heavily.   It was reported that therailway was being destroyed by a party of Arabs 15 miles North of Diwaniyah.Similarly, in a withdrawal from Mosul to railhead Shergat (187 miles from Baghdad), 1 battalion could be withdrawn in 5 days, 2 battalions in&quot; 7 days, and a mixed brigade in 15 clays. These estimates are rough and only provide for the movement of troops, their equipment and kit.7. Conclusion. It is impossible to take troops from Palestine or Egypt. Drawing troops from Mosul may increase our difficulties in some respects, and the troops so withdrawn, instead of helping in Mesopotamia, might well be engaged in fighting a harassing force from the north. Persia, therefore, remains the safest place from which troops can be withdrawn, and it is considered that on military grounds the General Officer Commanding, Mesopotamia, should be authorized to withdraw Norperforce.
On 12th July a heliograph message was received at Samawah from Rumaitha, No. x 9413, saying that the garrison there were holding out and in good heart.   Destruction of the 12.7.20. railway below Samawah appears to continue.The information contained in No. X 9413 was confirmed.   An armoured train No. x 9429, reached Samawah from Khiclr on 11th July prior to the destruction of sections of the 12.7.20. railway near Habdan.Officer casualties to 14th July are : 2 killed, 4 wounded. No.X 9425*14.7.20.General Officer Commanding, Mesopotamian Expeditionary Force, requests that the No. X 9436, brigade asked for in his No. X 9376 should be sent to Basrah as soon as possible, and 15.7.20. states that the situation will probably demand the remainder of a division.M.I. 2,16th July, 1920.Pakt II.The despatch of the forces from India asked for by General Officer Commanding, No. 85626, Mesopotamian Expeditionary Force, was requested by the War Office. m.o. 2,^On 12th July the situation at Rumaitha was not so good.   An attack was made No. X 9434, on a railway working-party on Baghdad-Hillah line.   The Shamiyah situation remains 13.7.20. unchanged.On 14th July, Rumaitha garrison (2^- companies infantry) replenished supplies by n0. X 9433, a raid during an effective bombing raid. 15.7.20.During the night the station 4 miles south of Khidr was unsucessfully attacked.A tribe of the Shamiyah Division is reported to have risen near Ibnali ; 45 levies guarding the post on the railway deserted with their rifles,The levies are entirely treacherous.General Officer Commanding reports that the rising in the Shamiyah Division has No. X 7958, caused a material and adverse change in the situation by exposing his lines of 15.7.20. communication between Baghdad and the relief force.   The rising threatens to become general.   The disturbances appear to be organized and synchronized with recent renewed Bolshevik activity by external intrigue.   Removal of all Government control appears to be their sole expressed object.The last reserves of the Mesopotamia Expeditoinary Force have been committed to the operation of relieving Rumaitha, and in the event of continued development of the present tribal situation the formation of a further reserve is essential. To draw in from the Upper Euphrates and Kirkuk would inevitably lead to disturbances there. &quot; As far as I can see, the only logical decision is to withdraw from the Mosul Vlaquet also in the event of the political situation deteriorating further, and in the case of such an occurrence.   I propose to order this possibly within a very few days.&quot;With these forces to form a central reserve in Baghdad, the lines of communi-cation on the Tigris, and the forces in Persia, can be established firmly. The fresh troops from India will be utilized on the Euphrates.It will be possible after the pacification of the country between Baghdad and the sea&apos;to re-occupy the evacuated areas in 1921. It is also a matter for consideration whether the force in North-West Persia should not now be withdrawn to Hamadan.(84111 . . a 2
Private.India Office,Whitehall, S.W. I.14th July, 1920.My dear Secretary of State for War,I am, of course, keeping in close telegraphic communication with Colonel Wilson, the Civil Commissioner at Baghdad. He informs me in a telegram, dated 9th July, that it is feared Kumaitha will have to capitulate and that there are as many as 200 civilians and a number of railway employees from derailed trains in addition to a garrison of some 250 rifles. Apart from the fact of the calamity that surrender will be, he is evidently apprehensive as to its effect on the country at large.Trouble is threatening elsewhere on the Middle Euphrates, notably in the Shamiyah Division, and Wilson would like to have the garrison at Kufa reinforced, hut he complains that the armed forces are not in a condition to give him sufficient assistance; that the British soldiers are too young and immature to be used for operations ; that the Royal Air Force cannot keep more than 16 machines in air in Mesopotamia and Persia and make more than six available for any single operation. That the armoured cars cannot be sent out of Baghdad owing to weakness or inefficiency of personnel. That some of the Indian regiments are much below strength and the men are insufficiently trained in musketry and Lewis guns, and that some units, after being drawn upon for departmental purposes, cannot parade much more than . 300 strong. That the motor transport in the country is worn out and of low efficiency, and that the defence vessels are unreliable.Of course I am well aware of the conditions that obtain everywhere as regards men and equipment just now, and of the great difficulties you must have to keep things going, but our people in Mesopotamia are, there is no doubt, faced with a serious situation, and I know that you will agree with me that we must strain every nerve to render all the men and material they have as efficient as possible.I am taking steps as to the complaint about the Indian troops, and I hope that the brigade which has been asked for, and is being held in readiness to go to Mesopotamia,, will, if it does so, proceed at something like war strength.You will I know do your best to assist as regards War Office part of the business.It is fair to Colonel Wilson to add that he has expressed these opinions in reply to a direct request of mine. But as I know that the Army Council do not like his excursions into military matters, I write to you personally, rather than send an official letter.I am glad to hear from him that General Haldane has returned to Baghdad, though the bulk of his staff and heads of departments remain in the hills. I still consider this a most unsatisfactory arrangement at the present somewhat critical juncture, and I sincerely hope, that it may be altered.Yours sincerely,Ed. S. Montagu.
P. 5188.From Civil Commissioner, Baghdad, to Foreign Office.Despatched -8th June, 1920. (No. R. 7825.) .      (Received 1st July, 5 pan.)My telegram, No. (?) 7347, dated 17th June. On 22nd June Mirza Mahomed Riza, son of the Chief Mujtahid of Kerbela, with several adherents, was arrested at Kerbela. About 10 extremist agitators had been arrested at Hillah a few days previously. All have been sent to Basrah for internment on Henjam Island where suitable accommodation is available.The effect of these nrrests has been excellent. Agitation has (? literally) subsided; confidence amongst chiefs and tribes has been restored ; revenue is coming in regularly, and situation is now once more practically normal on Middle Euphrates and there has been a corresponding improvement in situation in all the Shiah districts except in Najaf, which may still have to be dealt with. I have not received a single protest from any source against imprisonment of son of Chief Mujtahid ; on the other hand, it is abundantly clear that our action has given heart to Moderates, who have now come out into the open in nearly all of the country divisions, and have publicly repudiated extremist doctrines urged in Baghdad. Basrah Divisional Council, on 22nd June, passed a resolution disassociating themselves from Baghdad politics, and expressing coni&apos;.dence in present administration.Very extensively signed manifesto to the same effect has been received from Diwaniyah. Manifestoes which were being circulated in Amara had to be torn up, as no influential person would sign it or permit it to be circulated.It is noteworthy that developments in all these threatened places occurred previous to the arrests and must be regarded as reaction of the saner elements against the extreme party, but Moderate leaders are nevertheless much relieved that we have taken to support them, as tribes who are always on look out for loot were beginning to get restive at the prosp-ct of a weaker Government.There have been no further attacks of importance on our lines of communication or on our advanced position on Upper Euphrates at Anah.Decision to establish military posts at Tel-Afar has had an excellent effect in Mosul, which has hitherto been very nervous by the possibility of Sharifians or tribes obtaining control over British interests in this area, from which the bulk of grain used in Mosul is drawn.Sulaimaniyah and Arbilhave been apparently wholly unaffected by recent agitation and situation is in every respect most satisfactory. Road from Arbil to Rowanduz and thence into Persia vid Rayat is in good order. Large caravans are passing and the present regime appears suitable to all classes.Nasiriyah Division is in some respects unsatisfactory still owing to the fact that districts watered by Hai are wholly inaccessible to troops, and long continued disputes between Sadan overlords are a source of constant annoyance to tribesmen and anxiety to Government. Matters are being temporarily relieved by aeroplane visits, but for a permanent solution we must look in this area, as in a good many others, not to political changes for which there is no (? demand), but to adequate land settlement, to carry through which Administration has not got at present necessary skilled staff, and to wise regulation of taxation.Local officers, particularly on Middle and Lower Euphrates, have shown conspicuous ability in handling a difficult situation during last 2 months, and am greatly indebted to them and to local military authorities on Middle Euphrates, whose assistance has throughout been most timely and cordial.Repeated to Simla, Constantinople, Cairo, and Teheran ; copy to General, Baghdad, at Karand.P. 5220.From Civil Commissioner,.

On 2nd July tribes near Rumaitha. whe have for some time past been incited by agitators from Najef to rebellion, attacked tho
Government building at Rumaitha, killed Arab guard, and forcibly released sheikh, who had been imprisoned with my approval on previous day for inciting his people to rebel. Railway line has been cut above and below Rumaitha, and below Samawah, and considerable damage done.Military authorities have despatched reinforcements, and operations, having for their object punishment of tribes directly responsible, are in progress.Consequent on above development, it will be necessary, in all probability, to make arrests in Najaf and Kufa, which have become the centre of energetic pro-Turkish and anti-British agitation.Situation in Baghdad quiet at present and no developments elsewhere.Repeated to Simla, Teheran. Cairo and Constantinople.From General Officer Commanding, Mesopotamia, to War Office.Despatched 4th July, 1920, 1440. (No. X 9303, cipher.) .   (Received, 5th, 0800.)Part 1. On 1st July tribesmen attacked Government prison at Rumaitha, attacked and killed Arab guard. A sheikh imprisoned for causing disaffection was forcibly released. Instigation believed originated from agitator&apos; at Najaf. Following day tribe rose and cut railway and telegraph above and below Rumaitha and below Samawah.   Considerable lengths of line were torn up.Part 2. Midday, 3rd July, one train from Basrah with 100 rifle reinforcemeuts reached Samawah. Armoured train from Basrah following with additional 100 rifles was attacked and engine derailed about 12 miles south-east of Samawah. After inflicting - casualties on Arabs this train was taken back to El Khidr. Des(one group undecipherable)es(one group undecipherable) one company of Indian infantry from Hillah has reached Rumaitha. Reinforcements from Baghdad, including field and mountain guns, have reached Diwaniyah and more following.Part 3 and last part. On 3rd July aerial reconnaissances reported that considerable number of tribesmen destroying railway line and were burning an important bridge some 5 miles north of Sa(? ma-)wah. Bombing raid, despatched at dawn to-day not yet returned. My first (one group undecipherable) is to get railway through, but as Tigris River line is open supply situation is causing no anxiety. Subsequent punitive measures will be reported. Some arrests in Najaf of those implicated on 5th July will probably be made by Civil Commissioner.From General Officer Commanding, Mesopotamia, to War Office.Despatched 5th July, 1920.(No..X 9315, cipher.)

The rising (?) of the Shamiyah Division before the relief of Rumaitha has caused a material change in the situation, and adds (?) to the difficulties by exposing- my communications between Baghdad and the relief force to increased danger of attack. The rising threatens to become general and may spread as it was (? groups omitted) the Hai External intrigue organized and synchronized with recent renewed Bolshevik activity is at the bottom of the disturbances. Tribes who have risen appear to be affected by a wave of fanaticism. Neither they nor their leaders have in any instance formulated any specific grievances, and removal of all Government control appears to be their sole expressed object.Part 2. 2. I have committed my last reserves to the operation of relieving Rumaitha, and it is essential in the not yet certain event of tribal situation continuing to develop on its present lines that I should form further reserves at Baghdad to enable me to maintain my communication with Basrah and with troops in Persia and to pacify .the country. I could draw in my -detachments from Upper Euphrates and the Kirkuk area which are both quiet at present, but this action would inevitably lead before long to4 disturbances in these areas and would expose my communications with Mosul and these outpost guards. As far as I can see, the only logical decision is to withdraw from the Mosul (?) Vilayet, also, in the event of the political situation deteriorating further and in case of such occurrence, I propose to order this, possibly within a very few days.Part 3. 3. The troops from Mosul, Kirkuk and Upper Euphrates will give rne central forces in Baghdad, and with this I shall be able first to establish firmly the lines of communication from Basrah by the Tigris and to the forces in Persia, and then to initiate operations to pacify the country at a more convenient season. The troops from India, which I may require to be increased to a division, will be utilized on the Euphrates first to establish firmly the positions at Masiriyah and thence to extend it up the stream and re-establish order.4. It will be passible after pacification of the country between the sea and Baghdad to re-occupy the evacuafr d areas.Part 4 and last. 5. It is almost a matter for the consideration of His Majesty&apos;s Government whether the force in North West Persia should not now be withdrawn to Hamadan.6. I would request an early reply to this telegram, which foreshadows events which I still hope it may be possible to avoid. If your reply intimates the decision of His Majesty&apos;s Government to pursue the (?) proposals I have made above, I will formulate demands of my requirements which will be necessary to carry out the re-occupation of the country in 1921.
