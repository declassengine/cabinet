 CENTRAL AGENCY FOR THE ISSUE OF OFFICIAL COMMUNIQUES

 BY

 GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS.

 Memorandum by the Minister of Labour.

The questino of the continuance of the Press Bureau was brought and discussed by the War Cabinet on Thursday March 13th, 1919, and was ?erred to a Committee under the Chairmanship of the ? Secretary for ?ission.

 In conformity with the recommendation of that Committee, (War ?net paper, C.T.7062) the Press Bureau will cease to exist as such the 30th April.

 Apart from the censorship and other duties which will now lapse, the ? has had another function, vis. that of acting as common mouthpiece the Government Departments and being the agency through which official ?muniques have been issued to the Press. Accordingly whenever the ?artments hereafter wish to put out an official communique, they will ? to reproduce the subject matter (nearly 300 copies being necessary ? presss distribution) and distribute the typescript to the newspaper ? and press distributing agencies. This will entail similar work ? carried out by many departments which might be done as heretofore, ?ne single agency.

 It will also mean greater expense in staff than if performed by one ?.

 It is the opinion of some of the departments, with which I have been unofficial communication, viz. War Office, Home Office, Air Ministry, ? of Trade and Board of Education that the absence of a central ? hand, I believe would prefer to carry out their own arrangement ?ead of making use of a central agency such as I now venture to suggest.

 There is in active operatino, a Publicity Branch of th Demobilisation Resettlement Department of the Ministry of Labour. It is already


firing several  Departments  and to  In  close  touch  with  H*M.Stationeryfice.  various  advertising-  agents,  and  all  avenues of publicity. would be  quite feasible- for  this  Branch to  take aver tho existing111 staff  and  office equipment, -  Ronoo and  typewriting machines, etc.JD the Press Bureau, and to continue tho work  of issuing communiquesjlch would  bo submitted by  those departments  whioh are not dosirous of &apos;lortafeing  this work for thomsolvos.   This special section of the Publicity Branch  of tho Ministry of Labour established in Richmond Terrace,  which is convenient for most Government  To obviate clashing in the  demands  of the  different  departments forsp&amp;por space,  the officials at  the  head of the  section would bo empoweredgive priority to communiques  or in  doubtful  cases  to refer  to theprtnent concerned if a postponement of publication cf  their communiquethe next day seemed desirable.  The system of the central  issue of  official  communiques,  would be ast. of a convenience to most of tho newspapers as it would  be to theernnent.  Moreover there is great need Of an organisation  which can callBssary Press Conferences and  make arrangements for the attendance of  the opriate Journalists.  Most n&amp;j^tashavo frequently felt  the value of  a mechanism during ft&amp;ient tines.   It would also  undertake necessary irtisini campaigns and maLc provision for pofetors  and  their nl bution.  I vonturo to recommend that thtr Publicity Department of tho Ministry labour should be empowered to act as ths issuing agency  of all pressUr for tha various Government Departments which desire  its services.1Iop d 1 Q                                Bo       (Signed) R.
