MEMORANDUM  BY THE SECRETARY  OF  STATE FOR  WAR.    I circulate for the consideration of my colleagues a note which has been preparedby the General Staff.                                             WINSTON  S. CHURCHILL.    15th April, 1919.     1. At the beginning of 1919 the outlook in Siberia, both  politically and militarily,was black.  Vast tracks of land had passed into the hands of  the Bolsheviks, and theirsuccessful offensive, started early in December, had culminated in the capture of theimportant  towns of Ufa, Sterlitamak,  Orenburg,  Uralsk  and Orsk.   The  road  toTurkestan, with all its vast resources  in cereals, cotton, oil, &amp;c, and to Central asia and India,&apos; was  thus  opened  to the Soviet hordes, and the demoralization of  DutofFsArmy of Orenburg and Ural  Cossacks gave rise to grave misgivings as to whether itwould ever again become a fighting force.     These defeats reflected disastrously on the stability  of the Omsk Government, thevery existence of which was threatened mainly from three sources :      (a.)  Parties of the Right who criticised Kolchak&apos;s liberal  policy and  were  reliably           reported to be planning a coup oVetat to restore the Monarchy.     (h.)  Social Revolutionaries of the Left, who were openly hostile to Kolchak and in           league with the latent Bolshevik elements throughout Siberia, particularly           in the Far East.     (c.)  The Cossack Ataman, Semenoff, who, covertly supported and subsidized by the.           Japanese, was intriguing, if not for the complete downfall of  the Kolchak           Government, at least to declare the independence of the Far East and  possibly           of Mongolia at the first favourable opportunity.     This  situation was further  complicated  by the attitude of the Americans who,mainly through ignorancej refused to  co-operate with the Allies in supporting  theOmsk Government, and by their he stile attitude towards it were a source of encourage-ment to the smouldering embers of Bolshevism and anarchy.     Finally, the condition of the Trans-Siberian  Railway, the efficiency of which is a vital factor in the military and economic situation, was becoming rapidly worse  and had reached the stage where  a  complete stoppage was imminent.   The long-drawn-outnegotiations for Inter-Allied control of this railway were met with obstructions and pettyjealousies at every turn, and a successful conclusion seemed as  far off as ever.     &amp;     2. During  the last three months gratifying changes have taken place in^every direction, and the position to-day holds out bright prospects for the future.     The  results achieved in the successful counter-offensive  launched  by the Siberiansearly in March have more than justified the confidence placed  in Admiral Kolchak.  Inthe north good progress continues to be made towards Viatka,  and a, junction has been effected between small parties of the Siberian  and Archangel forces.  In the centre,General Khangin&apos;s Army  has rapidly  recovered,  and his advance, which has  alreadyaccomplished the recapture of Ufa and Birsk, continues.  In the south General  DutofTsArmy, strengthened and reinforced, has resumed the offensive and fought its way backto within a few miles of Orsk,  while the reorganization of the  Orenburg and UralCossacks  is progressing satisfactorily.   Moreover, the Bolsheviks have not  been able, toany appreciable extent,  to plunder the  much-needed  resources of  Turkestan.   TheOrenburg Tashkent Railway was thoroughly destroyed by the Cossacks  in  their withdrawal and, even to-day, it is  doubtful whether this, the sole means of communication,has been  re-established.(B19/198)  70 4/19 H&amp;S  7061wo
  &apos;   A similar improvement is noticeable in the^position of the Government, which hasbeen materially strengthened by the successes on the front.  Sir Charles Eliot reported on 18th  March  that  it was &quot;inspiring more general confidence,&quot; on March 26th &quot; theGovernment has risen in general esteem,&quot; and finally on the 5th April he  recommendedits recognition as a Provisional Government for Siberia.     Satisfactory progress has also been made in  the negotiations for  a  reconciliationbetween  Kolchak and Semenoff,  and all reports give strong  grounds for hoping thatSemenoff will recognize the  Admirafs  authority  and  thus  finally  dispose  of thisthreatening situation.   British recognition will  almost certainly bring  this adventurerdown on  to Kolchak&apos;s side.     Uprisings of local Bolsheviks continue and these constitute  a real danger mainly inthe Far  East.   Energetic  action has, however, been  taken especially by the japanese forces, and the more reasonable attitude recently adopted by  the American authoritieshas led to a better understanding between the Allies and Russians, thus  smoothing awaymany difficulties of the past.    Lastly, the  Inter-Allied agreement for  control of the Trans-Siberian Railway hasbeen concluded, and  an improvement in  the carrying capacity of the line is alreadyevident.     3. Of the many strong  reasons why  Admiral  Kolchaks  Government should berecognized by  Great Britain as a  Provisional Government  in Siberia, the following areoutstanding:     (a.)  It would probably be  followed by  similar  action on the  part of  France and           America and possibly by Japan as well.     (b.)  It would compel the Japanese finally to desist in their covert  support  of such           Russian elements as Semenoff, to their own selfish ends, and  at the same time           would be a deciding factor in liquidating the SemenofF incident.     (c.)  Its effect would be seen in the attitude of  the Americans, who could scarcely           persist in passive resistance  to  a  Government which had been  formally           recognized by Great Britain.     (d.)  Finally and most important of all-recognition of the Kolchak Government           may be expected to exercise a direct and most favourable influence on the           military situation at Archangel.   For  this reason  alone it is submitted that           such  recognition  is  imperatively  demanded  in  view  of the precarious           situation of the British and Allied forces now fighting for their  existence in           that theatre.   In the  present  state  of Russian affairs the&apos; political and           military factors are so inextricably entangled that any favourable political           impulse reacts  with  striking  effect on  military morale.  Recognition of           Admiral Kolchaks administration by  His Majesty&apos;s Government  will not           only add  immensely to the fighting efficiency of his troops and go far to           silence the discordant elements that have been intriguing against  him, but           will  reassure and invigorate the Archangel Government  more than any           military measures which it is in  General Ironside&apos;s power to  take.  It is           not too much to hope that in  such circumstances  a real  and permanent           junction may be effected between the  Siberian  and  North  Russian  forces,           which  will enable the  Archangel Government to  stand alone after the           withdrawal of the Allied troops.General Staff,       War  Office,           Uth April, 1919.    f
