To The Right Honourable Sir Auckland Geddes, K.C.B.,  M.P., Minister  of Reconstruction.  SIR,       In our first  Report we left certain questions relative to the  development of the nation&apos;s  mineral  resources, which had been specially referred to us, to be dealt with in another  Report, and we are now in  a position to submit an Interim Report on these questions.     The questions referred to us were to consider and report:            (1) Whether, and if so, to what extent, the general principles appropriate to the acquisition and       valuation of land for public purposes should be applicable to the special case of mines and minerals.           (2) What action is desirable to meet the difficulty of obtaining on reasonable terms                  (a) wayleaves, both above and below ground;                 (6) surface rights;       when such wayleaves or surface rights are required for the erection or extension of plant or premises       in connection with  the development of the  nation&apos;s mineral resources.           (3) Generally,  whether any,  and, if so, what, action is  desirable to  limit or extinguish  the loss       to the nation occasioned by leaving valuable products in mines for the purpose of  supporting  the       surface, or as barriers, or by being landlocked or by restrictive covenants, or otherwise.           (4) What changes are advisable in the law in connection with questions of support.     2. The members of our Committee  who have  served on this Committee are  Mr. Leslie Scott, K.C., M.P.  (Chairman), Mr. A. S. Comyns Carr, Mr. J. Inglis Davidson, Mr. Dixon H. Davies, Mr. Ellis Davies, Mr. George  M. Freeman, K.C., Sir William S. Haldane, Sir William Middlebrook, M.P., and Sir Arthur Thring, K.C.B.,     In order to strengthen the Committee in the  investigation and decision of the problem, referred to  us,  additional members with special  knowledge and practical experience  of the subject were appointed to  the  Committee.  The additional members so appointed were Mr. W. Forster-Brown, Sir Adam Nimmo, K.B.E.,  Sir Thomas Ratcliffe-Ellis, Mr. C. E. Rhodes and Sir R. Elliott-Cooper, K.C.B.     3. Since we embarked upon our investigation, questions relating to  the mining industry have arisen in  an acute form, which go far beyond the scope of our enquiry.     The question of wages, hours and conditions of employment in mines, and also the general question  of  the relations between employers  and  employed in the control of the  mining industry, are entirely  outside  our terms of reference, and we do not, therefore, submit any suggestion on these questions.  But wages,  hours, employment and other conditions of labour ultimately depend on the productivity of an industry,  and as by our terms of reference we are asked to  consider a number  of questions which directly affect the^productivity of mining industries  in this country, we conceive it  our duty at the present juncture to submit  an Interim Report, with a brief outline of the main conclusions at which we have arrived upon the specific  questions remitted to us for consideration.     4. Up to the present  the development of mineral resources in this country  has been  left to private  initiative.  State supervision  has been limited to  questions affecting  the health and safety of  persons  employed in mines  and similar matters.  The decision whether  minerals should be worked at all, and, if  so, upon what terms or conditions has  been left  to private agreement.  The State has not exercised any  control over the plan or manner of development.      x (37)7979(7664)  G 370  250 4/19  E&amp;S                                                A 2
ACQUISITION AND VALUATION OF LAND  COMMITTEEUS    4    5.  The chief difficulties in the way of development which have arisen out of this system may, we think(so far as our enquiry is concerned), be enumerated as follows :           (i) In  some  cases  owners have  restricted  development  on  grounds which  are  either  wholh:      unreasonable,  or, although perhaps  reasonable  from their point  of view, contrary to the national      interest.          (ii) Unless the owner has had control of a sufficiently wide area, and been gifted with adequate      foresight and wisdom, in himself or his advisers, there has been no general plan of mineral development ,      proceeding on  a scientific study of the geological conditions of an area as a whole.          (iii)  Where the ownership is  distributed in a number of small estates, or where the minerals are      owned by tenants in common, it sometimes happens that one or more owners refuse permission to I      work on  any terms, or endeavour to enforce  an exorbitant demand or cannot be found, with the result I      that the  area becomes landlocked, and, if it  is too small to justify  the sinking of a  separate shaft, the I      minerals are permanently lost.          (iv)  It  often happens that the owner of the surface has not parted  with his legal right to the      support of the minerals underneath the surface of his land and also under adjoining land.  Removal      of any appreciable proportion of the mineral certainly of the least proportion which  would  be      commercially profitable inevitably causes  some subsidence.   And subsidence extends not  only to I      the surface  vertically above the minerals  so worked,  but  also to  the adjoining surface for some      distance  away.   In such a case, apart from his liability for all damage caused to the surface by suet j      subsidence, the mine worker is liable at any moment to an injunction restraining  him from working 1      at all, if  subsidence is threatened.  There are also cases  where, although the mineral worker has the 1      right to let  down  the surface, he can only do so on payment of  all damage  caused;  and in such a case, I      fearing the risk of subsidence causing greater damage than the profits to be got out of the minerals, I      he leaves them unworked.  In all such cases the minerals so left are for the most part permanentlj I      lost to the nation.          (v) Coal is also often left in  barriers on the boundary of a mine to prevent the inrush of watei I      from other workings  on a higher level.  The total area of minerals left in  such barriers is very large, I      and we are satisfied that a comprehensive survey of existing barriers would show that a considerable I      portion could  be worked with safety.  But mine managers  hesitate themselves  to  take the risk If      because,  apart from  the danger to life which would arise in certain cases if  a mistake were made, I      and a passage  thereby opened for the  ingress of water,  the expense of pumping  may easily eat up I      the profits of the mine, or even render a  large area of mines on a lower level unworkable, and give 0      rise to immense claims for compensation  at  the instance of the  parties interested in those mines.    I          (vi)  It  is   sometimes difficult for a mine  worker  to obtain on  reasonable terms  wayleavftl      both above  and below the surface.   The mine worker, in  order to work  his mine efficiently and I      economically as it is in  the  national interest  that  he  should  do requires rights of  access on the I      surface to railways, canals, highways, &amp;c,  and below the surface the right to bring coal,  &amp;c. from I j      the mines of one lessor through the mines of another lessor.   If such rights or wayleaves are denied I      to him, or  are  only  obtainable on unreasonable terms, the  economical development of his mine is I      impeded, or the costs  of production unduly swollen.                                              -          (vii)  It  is  not infrequently difficult  for a  mine worker  to obtain on reasonable terms  otliei ?f      surface rights which  are necessary to  the  efficient  working of a mine.   As  an instance,  a mine I     worker may have an  insufficient  area  of surface ground for  dumping his colliery refuse or  other I     waste products; and as the working  of the mine proceeds he  will be seriously hampered  unless he j     can obtain reasonable facilities at a reasonable price.                                                     . .                                           .  I          (viii) A mining lease imposes numerous conditions  on the lessee as to  the method  of working 1     as well as provisions for the protection of the surface owner or adjoining mineral owner.  In some I     cases these terms unduly hamper the lessee and prevent the due  development of the mine.          (ix) Cases  arise where, owing to unforeseen circumstances, a colliery company or other mine     worker  is unable to continue the working of the mine, or of certain seams in the mine, unless some     modification or readjustment is made in the terms of  the original bargain between the  parties ;     concerned.  In such cases the minerals may be lost to the nation.          (x) In some cases the mineral owner may be quite willing to grant all reasonable facilities for     development, but owing to some  legal disability, whether in himself or created by the instrument     under which he derives ownership, he cannot do so without the sanction of some authority which is     competent to overcome this disability.          (xi) In  some  cases the mineral owner,  whether freeholder or leaseholder, is  bound by  special     restrictive covenants  imposed for the protection of  the surface  owner or the owner of adjoining     minerals which either impede or prevent the full development of  his minerals.          (xii)  In  some cases, owing to insufficiency  of capital, or the  desire to snatch a quick profit-     e.g., because  of the approaching termination  of the lease lessees have (in disregard of proper mining     development) picked the eyes out of a mine and abandoned it in  such a condition that it can probably     never profitably be reopened.   We believe  that this particular difficulty arises mainly in cases o     metalliferous mines.                                                                           &apos;         (xiii)  Although the Geological Survey has collected  a good deal of valuable  information from     a purely scientific point  of view, and the Home  Office is in possession of  some very useful records,     there is no Government Department regularly receiving and preserving sufficient records of the condition     of our mineral resources, developed and undeveloped, as a whole, nor is any Department charged with     any general survey of them.         (xiv)  There is equally no organised system  for the exploration and testing of  undeveloped     mineral fields.
INTERIM  REPORT.     6.  We have considered how the defects above enumerated should be dealt with,  and we are of opinion^hat these defects can best be remedied by the adoption of certain proposals which will be embodied in ourj main Report, but which may be shortly summarised as follows :            The main principle on which we proceed is that laid down in our First  and Second Reports, viz.,       that whenever it is in the  national interest that land (which includes minerals) should be  applied to       some use other than that to which existing owners or occupiers are putting it, a case is established for       compulsory powers being  granted for its acquisition.  In the case  of the development of the nation&apos;s       mineral resources, application of this  principle leads us  to the  conclusion that,  as a general rule,       whenever it is necessary  for such development that any rights  of  user or working, or even ownership       should be obtained  in  either surface or minerals, including rights of working  the  minerals, the right       to let down the surface, rights of way, or, indeed, any right in, over, or under land, a compulsory order       should be obtainable from the Sanctioning Authority^ which we have recommended should be estab-       lished; always subject to  the corollary that just compensation must be paid to the party affected.     We recommend, therefore, that            (a) There should be one  Government Mining Department,  in which should be centralised all       departmental duties in connection with mining.  It should have initiative, advisory,  and executive       powers, and  should receive and consider all applications for  compulsory powers  to work minerals,       or in connection with  such working, and report thereon to the Sanctioning Authority.  It should also,       on its own motion, make  recommendations to the Sanctioning Authority for the like purposes.           (6) The Mining Department should not be a separate Ministry, but a branch of the Home Office.       (which to-day administers the Mines Regulation Acts).           (c) There should   be a [strong Advisory Council as an essential part of the machinery  of  the       Mining Department, consisting of representatives of the mining industry, including workers, together       with men eminent in branches of  science connected with the  industry.  It should also have local       sub-committees reporting to it and similarly constituted.           (d) Before  fresh  mines are opened up such  information should  be furnished to the Mining       Department,  as will enable it to consider the proposed area, boundaries, and general method of       development  in  relation  to  other workings,  existing or prospective,  in the same  mineral  field, and       thus obviate the risk of future production  of the field as a whole being impaired by initial mistakes.           (e) Full information should be lodged with the Mining Department before any mine is abandoned,       so as to facilitate the continuance or future resumption of working.           (/)  The Mining  Department should be  equipped with  adequate information and  powers  to       safeguard the proper  development of  mineral  fields, and to secure the working  of minerals which       would otherwise be lost to the nation.           (g) Whenever it can be shown that  the best  development of the  nation&apos;s mineral resources is       impeded by a right of private property, the Sanctioning Authority should grant compulsory powers       to deal with the situation on fair terms to  the owner.     Thus-           (h) The&apos; Sanctioning  Authority should where it is in the national  interest make compulsory       orders for the acquisition of minerals with all necessary working powers.           (i) The Sanctioning  Authority should, in  proper cases, by compulsory order, grant wayleaves,       both above and below ground, and surface rights.           (j) To prevent  the loss of  minerals caused by the surface owner having  a right of support, we       propose that the Sanctioning Authority  should, in proper cases, make compulsory orders for the working       of minerals, with power to let down the surface, subject to compensation for all  damage caused thereby       to the surface owners. Such compensation should be  secured  by the creation of  an insurance fund,       which  should be contributed to by all parties benefited by the release of the minerals in  question,       the  liability of the mineral worker being  limited to his premiums. In  order  that the surface owner       may have adequate security in  the  initial stages of the insurace fund, and  before risks have been       ascertained, the insurance fund should be guaranteed by the State.j           (&amp;) The  Sanctioning Authority should  in any  compulsory order  have  power to make such       provisions both as  to the  methods of working the  minerals and  as to  the existing and future       user and development of  the surface as may be calculated to minimise damage to the surface       caused by the  working of the minerals.  Such provisions should be made subject to payment of       proper compensation to any person affected, and, of  course, with  due regard to the public advantage       from all points of view.           (I) Any surface owner who has  no right of  support  should  have  power  to apply  to  the       Sanctioning Authority for an order giving him such right of  support, if any, as may be reasonable       under the circumstances,  and on  such terms as the Sanctioning  Authority may  determine.           (m) In order to minimise the loss of coal left  in barriers, the Mining Department should have       power  to prepare a scheme dealing with all the  barriers in a  mineral  field, and the Sanctioning       Authority should, after hearing  all parties concerned have power to  approve the scheme and make       such order as may be  appropriate regarding the barriers to be left or  substituted,  the working of the       barriers which are to be worked and the protection of all parties affected.           (n) Where  there  is  a possibility  of  loss to the nation  arising from mineral products being       landlocked or bound by restrictive covenants,  the Sanctioning Authority should deal, by compulsory   In our First Report we recommended that a new Sanctioning Authority should be created, and that to this SanctioningAuthority should be referred every application for power to acquire land compulsorily, with certain exceptions in the casej Local Authorities.  The Sanctioning Authority would be composed of Members of both Houses of Parliament, with the Idition  of outside members of experience in various spheres of national life, including Labour, and would,  in effect, a Joint Committee of the two Houses of Parliament. t The merit of  this  proposal obviously depends on the  detailed provisions  for working out the  scheme, which Jl appear in our main Report.
in-ACQUISITION AND VALUATION OF LAND COMMITTEE &apos;, INTERIM REPORT.4i:      order, with such cases upon fair terms of compensation to the owner, or the person entitled to tho      benefit of such covenants.          (o) The types of case referred to by us in  paragraph  5 (viii. and ix.) may also sometimes      for the intervention of the Sanctioning Authority.  It should be clearly understood that we do not      suggest such intervention merely because one of the parties has  made a bad bargain; but where,      unless  the bargain between the parties is modified, the nation may suffer a loss of minerals which      might be worked with economic advantage to the nation, we are of opinion that there would be a      case for an application to the Sanctioning Authority for a compulsory order.          (p) We anticipate that in those cases where  interference with existing rights is required in      the national interest, the Mining  Department will endeavour to effect an arrangement between the      parties concerned and that recourse  to the Sanctioning Authority for.a compulsory order will only      be necessary in those cases in which such an arrangement is found to be impossible.  Indeed, one      of the  chief merits of our recommendations as to the acquisition of compulsory powers,  is that      voluntary  agreement will be greatly facilitated by the knowledge  of all parties that in proper cases      compulsion is available in the last resort.    7. In our opinion  the constitutional, legal and administrative changes which  we have summarised above, will free  the development of the mineral resources of the  country from most of the hindrances towhich it is liable under the present system of working.    We  believe also that  the disadvantages which we  have  enumerated  as inherent in the present systemconstitute some of the  chief reasons  in the minds of many  of those who are in favour of nationalisation.We do not conceive it to be within our province to express any opinion whatever on nationalisation, exceptfrom the point of view of the specific questions referred to  us.   But, in our opinion, if the disadvantageswe have mentioned are remedied by  the means which  we recommend, the main drawbacks of the existing system, so far as our  terms of reference are concerned, will disappear, and the development of the mineral resources of the country will be substantially promoted.  And we do not think that any form of Stateownership or  working would provide as good a remedy for these  disadvantages as the remedies  whichwe recommend.                                                       We are, Sir,18th March 1919.f       Your obedient Servants,(Signed)    LESLIE SCOTT.           W. FORSTER-BROWN.           JAMES J. DAVIDSON. *           DIXON H. DAVIES.           R.

We regret that we cannot see our way to sign  this  Report, although we are in  substantial agreementwith the whole of it, except the last paragraph, but that appears to us to be altogether too sweeping.    We think that many of the results at which we are  aiming might  be attained by national ownership of minerals, whatever may be said  for or against that proposal on financial or other grounds.  While we do not,as at present advised, think that the creation of a gigantic State monopoly in the working of minerals would tend on the whole to greater efficiency, we are convinced that full development of our mineral resources will never be secured unless the State is able and  prepared both to take  over and work inefficiently managedmines, and to take  an active part by exploration and research in developing new fields.  -                                                              (Signed)    A.
