With  reference  to  the  48th Meeting, Minute 3,  the*VW  OF SBPARA- :o.I  ALIiQWANOES    Committee  had under  consideration a memorandum by thoCO \m  WIVES ANDINDENTS  OF MEN  Minister of Pensions (Paper Bo,,136) on the  subject  of  the&apos;M THE  NEW  ARMIES.                  Supplementation of Separation Allowances  to the Wives  and                  Dependents of tho  Men in the New Armies,                       THE MINISTER  OB1 PENSIONS explained that the Committee                  on  February 25th had decided to postpone  consideration                  of  this matter until tho War Office had formulated their                  scheme for the conditions of service for  the New Standing                  Army.  Two Army Orders, however, whioh had  been issued                  in  the meantime, on  the 29th March and the  1st April,                  appeared to prejudice the issue.  The Army  Order of                  the 29th March, which enabled men serving under the                  Military Service Acts to re-monlist for periods of                  two,  three or four&apos; years, promised them a con-                  continuation  of the rates of separation and  dependence                  allowances including special parents  allowances,                  though no  reference  was made to the supple-                  mentation  of separation allowance.
                       -&amp;mBy the Army Order of the 1st April, men-who -re-enlistedafter discharge or demobilisation were not eligible for anygrants under the regulations of the Special Grants committee or of the Civil Liabilities Committee. These Army Orders left the exact position in doubt and would lead to a great deal ofconfusion in meeting claims for supplementation.  He under-stood that the system of supplementation was intended to apply only to those soldiers who were retained compulsorily in theArmy under the Military Service Acts, and not to any soldiers                                         theirwho re*enlisted voluntarily either during/period of service or after discharge or demobilisation.  In order to make thisclear he proposed, if the  Committee concurred, to circulate to Local War Pensions Committees the letter a copy of whichwas Attached to his memorandum.      MR.FOHSTSR said there were two distinct categories of menconcerned.  In the first place there were those who had re-engaged without waiting to be demobilised, and the War office had promised them that all the allowances of which they werein receipt would be continued.  It was impossible for the WarOffice to fail to carry out this promise by cutting off the supplementary separation allowance.  The second class of menwere those who, after demobilisation and a period at homecame back into the Army at their own convenience; these men onre-enlisting signed a declaration to the effect that they recognised that they were  not entitled to any special Allowancessuch as separation, parents&apos; and supplementary allowances.There was a distinct cleavage between these two classes, andthe letter of the Pensions Minister as drafted did not, there-fore, meet- the intentions  of the War Office.      THE MINISTER 0? PENSIOilS suggested that if the War Officedesired to continue the supplementary allowance that Department,rather than the Local War  PenBions Committees should undertake the administration of the  scheme.
                \               - 3 -The War Office were already ^re^jonoihlo for paying out the separation allowances, and as the rmp^emerrtary ul^omac-a -wasa flat rate and was in no way a discretionary grant, ther^ehonldbe no difficulty in thcSrundertaking&apos; tho distribution of that too-A large proportion of the work at present undertaken by the Localil,&apos;ar Pensions Committee was performed for the War Office, andwas work which would normally have ceased at the end of the War:and If it could now be transferred to the V;ar Office thiswould enable him to effect, considerable economies in the work-Ing of his Departments     THE CHAIRMAN said there appeared to bo two points at issue.In the first place ho did not think the Committee could acceptthe instruction contained in the circular letter as drafted, by theMinister of Pensions that men who had re-enlisted during their enggemeni and had been promised continuance of all their allowances were not to receive supplementary separation allowances.   Thesecond question was whether the administration of the supplomon-tatlon should remain with the Ministry of Pensions or whetherthe War Office would now be prepared to undertake this duty.     MR. BARSTOVZ said that the Army Orders of the 29th March didnot expressly state that the supplementary allowance would becontinued to men re-enlisting during their service.     MR. POSTER said, that it would be impossible to differentiatein the case of these men between the ordinary allowances andsupplementation.   With regard to the administration of the granthe had assumed that the Local V,ar Pensions Committees would continue in existence for some time yet.   In any case theywere still charged with the administration of the civil liabilities Grants, and even if the latter were not Intendedto be given to the long term soldier tfoeyvfould not cease for fouryears.   As regards the men to whom the supplementation should.be given  he thought it was premature to come to a/
decision at present.  It was quite clear that tho mem who re-engaged without a break: in their sor/ice must be considered, en-titled to it.     MR. ROBS said  that no reference to tho supplementary allowance was made in the recruiting instructions issued for the Air Force.He agreed With Mr- iorster that the  issue mast be continued to menwho had no break in their service.   it the same.: time men who hadreceived it in the past, and who after a very short time had joined up again in response to the urgent recruiting demands tomaintain the Air jtarce in being might regard it as a breach of faith if they did not receive the allowance,   He further ss^edwhether it was the intention to bring these supplementary allowances to an end at the close of the occupation period forall men;  if so, this would, simplify the question now being con-sideredj and the allowance might..be continued to all previousholders.    The Air Ministry, however, were not committed eitherway.     THE CHAIHMAI1 said that this was quite a different matter,He thought, however, that the Air Ministry should make plain tomen who were now coming back, whether to the transitionary or thepermanent Air I^orce, the conditions  under which they were engaged,     MR. JORSTSR said that all the conditions of service in theArmy would have to be reviewed within the next few days, and itmight be found advisable to cut out  the whole system of, allowances.     MR. BARSTOw&quot; referred to the War Cabinet decision on thismatter of February  28th, 1^19 (W.C-.538, Kin: 7), vi&apos;z:: that theprinciple of supplementation would have to continue in the caseof the men retained for the Armies of Occupation.   It would appearfrom this that the  intention was to  continue supplementation onlyto those men who were retained ccmpulsorily, and not to those alsowho re-enlisted during their period  of service.   He was not pre-pared to accept a decision on the latter point without reference tohis Department.  He assumed, that it  would not be given to men en-listing for the first time-     TEE CHAIRMAN explained to Dr. Machamara. who entered at thispoint, the course the discussion had taken,
             I)R.  WAONAMARA said&apos;it appeared to him that the  position        taken up by the Committee might prejudice the whole  system        of  allowances  in the  permanent Army;   and he  suggested that, if        the var Office wished to  raise voluntarily -in future an army        strong enough  to meet our responsibilities, they would have  to        proceed very cautiously and examine carefully all the proposals        put forward with regard to pay and allowances.-             THE  COMMITTEE decided:-                  (a)    To accept the  principle of supplementation in                        the case  of  the men retained  compulsorily in the                        Army  and  men continuing their service without                        any break;   but that  supplementation should                        not be  granted to  men enlisting for  the first                        time  or re-engaging after demobilisation or                        discharge.                  (b)    That  the  Ministry  of  Pensions should for the                        present continue the administration of the                        grant of  supplementary allowances.                  (c)    That  the  Ministry  of  Pensions,  after con-                        sultation with the krar Office as to  the pre-                        cise  wording to be employed,  should  circulate                        to the  Local r&apos;ar Pensions Committees a letter                        conveying the  decision of the Committee.                              vA, BARSTOY&apos;  reserved his  consent to the                        above decisions until he had  consulted his                        department on  the  matter. AND     2.,   DR.  MAC NA MAR A said that a man in the Navy-who married,SERVICE after enlistment received separation  allowance.   He understood HE NAVYi,            :  AND //  hat this was&apos;  not the case in  the  Army.   fRCtf.             MR.  F0RSTT3R said that that was so until  he came on to the        married establishment.             MR..ROSS  said that the  same conditions prevailed in the        Air Force as in the Navy,.that is  to  say, the man would        receive separation allowance if he married after enlistments        He  added that  this was  understood  to  be in accordance with the,        G-overnment decision that  a date would be publicly notified if        the right to marry with a separation  allowance were  to be        withdrawn.             After a discussion on the conditions obtaining/in the
three Services, the Committee decided:-          To draw the urgent attention of the Chancellor          of the Exchequer to the necessity of correlating          the conditions of service in the Navy, the Army          and the Air &quot;Force, and to.-recommend that for this          purpose a permanent Committee composed as under          should be set up to bring into uniformity the          whole question of the pay, allowances, pensions          and cash emoluments of all kinds of the three          Services.               A Representative of the Treasury (Chairman)               A Representative of the Admiralty                       &quot;        &quot;   &quot;  War Office                       &quot;        &quot;   &quot;  Air Ministry                       &quot;        &quot;   &quot;  Ministry of Pensions     DR. liAGMMARA desired to place on record his dissent from the proposal.   It was, of course, highly desirablethat Departments should pool information.,   But he opposed the policy of a permanent Committee to put a foot-rule overproposals of the various Departments.   That was uniformityrun-mad.   The Services iisere quite differentn&apos; 2,  Whitehal 1 Gardens,  S.?;r.           29th April  1919.
