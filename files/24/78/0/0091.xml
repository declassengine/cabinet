hoi :  &apos;YI:.j8Sty&apos;8  ($ 4 e)C) 1*^ cj&quot;^Bs^STTes of Scientific and  Technical  Officers in the   Government Service,Memorandum by the Secretary of state for War.     I agree in the proposal(now before the War Cabineton G.T. 7100 and .7155.) that a Committee should be appointedto consider the salaries of Scientific and Technical Officersin the Government Service.  The question is one in whichthe War Office is much interested, and at the present momentwe are faced with the difficulty of retaining in the publicservice on the present authorised salaries various Officers,some holding temporary commissions in the Array as well ascivilians, whom it is essential to retain for research worketc,   If the staff is once dispersed, progress in manymatters of great importance will suffer seriously,.     I ask accordingly that the War Office may be represent-ed on the proposed Committee and that the matter may betreated as one of extreme urgency.V(Intd.)  W.  S.  C,5 th 11May,l01 Q
