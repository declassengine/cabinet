POLITICAL INTELLIGENCE DEPARTMENT,   [April 9, 1919.]                                            FOREIGN OFFICE,  ^  (11152.)                                                      BELGIUM /003.                                 MEMORANDUM                                        ON                    THE  REFERENDUM IN LUXEMBURG.     THE  question of the  moment in Luxemburg is that  of the referendum to be takennext  month  on the question of the maintenance or rejection of the Nassau dynasty,with  which  it  is now  proposed  to couple  that  of the economic orientation of thecountry.     The decision  to resort to a  referendum might he regarded merely as a harmlessexperiment in  &quot; self-determination,&quot; but a study  of the recent  course  of events inLuxemburg and the resulting political situation  shows  that it has  not this simplecharacter.     The population  in Luxemburg was in 1910  nearly 260,000, of whom only about,300 were Protestants  and 1,200 Jews;  the great majority,  therefore, is Catholic, atany  rate  in  denomination.  The  Court and  its hangers-on  are very  much under theinfluence of pro-German ultra-montane  Clericals.  A minority of the people (socialists and  Liberal Left Wing,  plus  a  small group  of intellectuals  of French culture)  isRepublican, and most of the Republicans favour  political union  with France.  The main body of Liberals is  Monarchist,  but  clearly realises that the dominant  factors inLuxemburg policy must be (l) the economic future  of the  country ; and  (2) the necessityof remaining on good terms with the Allied  Powers.  They are prepared to sacrifice thedynasty, to accept &quot;personal union &quot; with Belgium under King Albert  as Grand Duke,and  to  decide  the question of economic orientation strictly on  economic grounds.  Thedesire for autonomy is  strong in all classes and parties and this  desire, it seems, is being exploited  by the  present  Government or perhaps it would  be truer to say by thepresent Minister  of State * in  order  to  maintain  the .ascendency  of the ClericalParty, f     On the .9th January, the Left of the Chamber, from which the clerical Right had pre-viously withdrawn, voted unanimously for the deposition of the dynasty,  and by 16 votes to 14 (the total number of representatives is 52) for  the proclamation of a republic.  TheChamber then  appointed a Committee of  Public  Safety consisting of four  socialists and four Liberals.  On the 10th January this body  had to give way to a purely Socialistcommittee, which attempted to proclaim a republic but  was  prevented from  doing soby the French troops forming the  body-guard of General Foch.  On the same day theGrand Duchess Marie Adelaide  abdicated, and her sister, the Princess Charlotte wasproclaimed Grand Duchess by the Government,   which shortly afterwards appealed tothe  Allied Governments for  recognition, but received no encouragement.   At thebeginning of March the Government brought forward a proposal for a plebiscite to decide the question whether the Nassau dynasty was to be maintained or not.     The  aim  of the  Government  in  the referendum as in  the proclamation  of the princess Charlotte, seems to be  to  create a fait accompli before the Allies make adefinite declaration  against  the dynasty.   They  have meanwhile  done  their best toget it believed (1) that  the independence  of the   country  stands or falls  with thedynasty ;  and (2) that  the  dynasty and the Government enjoy  the favour of the Allies.They believe that if  the  referendum can be taken before  any declaration on the part ofthe Allies  comes to falsify their representation  of the  position, the  voting will be in   * The head of the Government has, under the Constitution of Luxemburg,  very extensive powers; theother Ministers are known as Directors-General of Departments.  All are nominated by the Grand Duke.   f In September 1918 the then Liberal Government (Prime Minister Kaufmann) fell, and fresh electionsresulted in the return of a Clerical majority in the  Legislative Chamber. The present Government underM.lleuter is nominally a Coalition Ministry, but its policy appears to be shaped by the Minister of State.   The Government consists of        M. Renter (Clerical, lawyer), Foreign Affairs and Minister of State.       M. Meyens (also Clerical and a lawyer). Finance.       Professor Welter (Socialist Democrat and a poet who writes in German), Education.       M. Liesch (Liberal,.Juge dlnsTruction), Justice and Public Works.       Burgomaster Collart (People&apos;s Party, Agriculturist), Food Supply and Agriculture.       [1130]-510
  favour of maintaining the dynasty, since many Luxemburgers, though hostile t6 the . present Grand Duchess are  in  favour  of  monarchical  government, fearing that the  establishment of a republic would sooner or later mean incorporation with France.    .   In the debate on the referendum, leading Liberals like MM. Pescatore and Brasseur  strongly urged the postponement1 of the referendum until the country had before  it  the facts that really condition its  future, viz. :  (I) the feelings of the Allied Governments  about  the rejection or maintenance of the Nassau dynasty ; (2) the balance of economic  advantages as between  the Belgian and French connection.  They, discount the report  which has been presented by a Government (not Parliamentary) Commission in favour  of economic  union  with France, on  the  ground that it was appointed ad hoc by the  Government, and that its presentation of the  case is false and biased, and has been  refuted by Belgian studies of the economic question.   They urge  that the result of an  immediate referendum would be to confirm the dynasty in its position and that this  would create  a dangerous situation for the country in relation to the Allies.   &quot; Let us,&quot;  they say, &quot; at once take  steps to  ascertain the wishes of the Allies regarding the dynasty,  and settle that question in accordance with  their views which, in spite of the assurances  of the Government, we  strongly suspect  are  adverse  to the retention  of the dynasty.  That question having  been disposed of, the referendum would have  some value and can  decide en connaissance de cause the questions (1) of Republic versus  Monarchy, and  (2) connection with France or  with  Belgium.&quot;  A  Liberal motion to send  delegates. representing  every political group to Paris in order to ascertain the facts, was rejected  by the majority in the Chamber,  the  Minister of State reiterating  but  refusing to  give any facts to corroborate his  assertion that the Grand Duchess and her  Government  were viewed  with favour by the Allies.  Liberals  are convinced that  if it  were known  before the referendum that  the Allies desire the removal of the dynasty  the monarchical  parties, who greatly outnumber the republicans, would rally towards personal union with  Belgium.       The question of connection with France or  Belgium has both a political and  an  economic aspect.  As  to the second, the  economic, opinion in Luxemburg  seems to  be  fairly evenly  divided.   The mining industry and the metallurgists fear that if luxembourg -  burg  were added  to  France as well as Alsace-Lorraine  and the Saar basin,  France  would have a practical monopoly of iron  ore on the Continent.  They therefore  favour  the Belgian connection as offering a better market.   The vine-growers  also favour the  Belgian connection on similar grounds.   In spite of French protection, the agriculturists  are said to be in favour of.France.       On the  1st March proposals  for a  referendum were carried  in the Chamber  by  30 votes to 20.  Normally this decision would have  to be  confirmed  by a  second vote  of the Chamber, but the Council of State (the members of which are nominated by the  Sovereign) has power  to dispense with the second vote.  A telegram  of the 5th April  announced that this had been done, and  that the plebiscite would probably be taken  on  the 4th May.  Belgium and  the Future of Luxemburg.       The Belgians are  naturally anxious that Luxemburg should opt for re-union  with  their country, with which, it is urged, Luxemburg has greater natural ties  of language  and affinity than with France, (there are, for instance, more Luxemburg-Belgian  than  Luxemburg-French marriages) and which offers a better market  than France  to the  leading industries of Luxemburg.  But Belgium does not seem to have made any direct  propaganda in Luxemburg.   The Brussels Government  received, early  in  the  war,  assurances from- M.  Ribot and the President of the French Republic that France  had no  intention of  annexing the  Grand  Duchy, and  these  assurances  were renewed by  M.  Pichon aud M. Clemenceau in  the  summer of  1917.  But Belgian confidence in  these pledges has been rudely  shaken by the action of Marshal Foch  and the  propa-  ganda carried on in the French press.       When the armistice was being  prepared  the  Brussels  Government  wished the  Grand Duchy to be included in the zone of their  army.   The French Government,  however, said that this was a military question to be decided by Marshal Foch.  The  Grand Duchy was  declared to be an American sector,  but in  the event Marshal Foch  chose Luxemburg  as  his head-quarters,  bringing with, him  a  crack regiment as his  body-guard.   Marshal Foch  is a strong Catholic,  and he and  his  body-guard were  iegular in attendance at mass and other functions of the Church, thus  to some  extent  counteracting the  anti-clerical reputation  of their country.   They  made  themselves  popular in other  ways  by  giving concerts, plays,  &amp;c.   Their tactics seem to have
influenced public opinion in Luxemburg, and many papers  began to write in  favour ofthe French-connection,  The French Party were encouraged to demand annexation  toFrance in  case the Grand Duchess abdicated.  Another active agent of French prbpa-ganda has been M.  Mollard, who before the war was French  Minister at Luxemburg,and who was given his  passports in  August 1914 in  deference to the demand of theGerman officer  commanding there.   M. Mollard  was  blamed by his countrymen forquitting his post, and  is believed to  have  since  been  working for the annexation ofLuxemburg in order to retrieve his position.    His  organ is &quot; Le Luxembourgeois &quot;started  by him and published  in Paris, which  advocates annexation and representsLuxemburg as anxious to become French.
