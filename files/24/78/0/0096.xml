In one reapsot it is as active as ever - in propaganda.      The persistently circulated reports of huge sums of money transferred to Allied countries and of extensive forgeries of Allied Currency Notes strongly suggests that the reports are part of,their system of propaganda, eapeoially as the police in. Switzerland, to which the most detailed of the reports relate. have failed to discover any of these sums of money, and, the English forged notes have not been discovered in this country.      In Hungary and Bavaria the foothold of the Communist&quot;( Governments seems also to be very Insecure.      The: Italian situation, which again was becoming unsatis4&apos; factory has been relieved ty the wave of national enthusiasm about the. Flume inoident.      The Spanish Government prefesses to have discovered evidence of German complicity In Ihe reoent Syndicalist disturbances.      In Scandinavia, Holland and Switzerland the situation appears easier,      Thou^i no evidence of  Bolshevik Influence has been found either in iJgypt or India, the.Nationalists have no doubt resorted to violent action as a.,, consequence of the news that reaches them of violent.; disturbances ^elsewhere.                     4      There&quot;. In no doubt that,/the-Russian Bolshevists are &quot;sending propaganda, mate rial to kIndia and the Far east&apos;,. though, as mentioned in a farmer  report,, the methods adopted show a singular ignorance of  astern conditions.            .  -.     &apos;  .  &apos;     . f,.      On the whole the  position as  regards Bolshevism is less menacing than it was  three  weeks ago.    -
 FjMca                                                *           339f             The extremists are ertaramejy^dlseppe^^       of th*^jrtrik*-4ac^^                 they hoped to have a ()     sympathetic general Strjlce,   They are  also  bitterly -disappxdrtted       at the decision of the English Socialists not  to join the       Third International at Mosoow.              The Socialists have published their  programme, declaring       revolution to be inevitable  in some  form, but  stating that  the       Socialist Party is master neither of the form  nor  of the hour       in whidb the revolution will take place.   It is numerically       weak - 34,000, a very small  proportion of the  whole population *       but it is inoreasing.   The  ground has been to some extent  cut       away from it by the concession of the Eight Hours  Day, whioh       was its strongest ground for agitation.              The unpopularity of President Wilson and of the American;       generally is very marked among the middle and  upper classes, BELGIUM              The Socialists are becoming more extreme in their views       and the commercial classes are showing increased apprehension       and also suspicion of England.  It is rumoured that England       is opposing Belgian interests in Paris and  that raw material       is being withheld for the sake of British  export.   Thou$i       prices in Antwerp are high there is  no shortage of supplies,       but there is a great deal of unemployment  and  a very strong       aaU-military feeling.  So far, however, there is no evidence       of organised Bolshevik propaganda, though  any  disturbances  in       Holland would undoubtedly react upon Belgium.              The socialist Party hopes to  come into  power at  the       next eleotlon, for, under the new eleotoral system, the       workmen will have a majority of some 30o,000 votes, provided       that women&apos;0 suffrage is not passed.              The relations with British troops are on the whole       satisfactory.
                                                               40.0  &apos;mamm.......               &quot;Ekie trial of FLATTiUv,  ORBiM,  IsOBS and  SOHK&amp;IDER  in    &apos;   erne, on charges of Inciting to mutiny and strikes,  resulted.      In s-antencea,yaryiug from four weeks to six months.   There -   &apos;   were no riotous demonstrations s though meetings were  held      after the sentence was pronounced.  FLATTED was last  reported      to be on his way back from Russia with a very large sum of      money, but news of the sentence my affect his  movements.      He will probably be deprived of his Swiss citizen ship.               The Police have made domiciliary visits in the hope      of traoing the alleged deposit of Bolshevik funds, but  they      find that the sum has ntver exceeded a few thousand francs,      and the only discovery of note was a plan of organisation for      a Red Guard, which was found in the house of a lawyer named      DICKER.  It seems probable that the wide circulation  of news      of large sums being sent for propaganda purposes in Allied      countries, as well as of the extensive forgeries of Allied      currency notes, is part of a Bolshevik system of propaganda      to shake publio confidence in the Allied countries.GBK1MY               The situation Is still very obscure, and the varlois      reports contradictory.  There is no room for doubt that the      German Government Is seriously alarmed about the spread of      Bolshevism, but it seems equally certain that they are  ready      to exaggerate the danger, in order to frighten the Allies      into oonceding better terms.  How far they approve of the      proceedings of their agents in neutral countries in their      attempts to infect the soldiers of occupation it is difficult      to judge, but it is significant that a number of their old      agents, who certainly do not work without pay, have      reappeared in Switzerland.  The General Staff have undoubtedly      been engaged in a sini&amp;er intrigue, for the Police Oommissione      of Utrecht has  stated that Koener had received instructions                                                             to/
to retain all MB agents in England and Holland.  TheSpartaoiets themselves say that some of the riets werethe work of agents provooateurs. aoting under Militaryorders, and it is said that Liebknecht had proof of this,whioh he intended to publish had he lived,,  The objectof this intrigue was to foster recruiting for theVolunteer Army and convince the people of the neoessityfor Military protection.         There is considerable apprehension about what may happen on iuay 1st.  A report from Copenhagen describingan International Bolshevik meeting at Munioh on the 28thMarch  states that a gre&amp;t effort to upset the Governmentwill be made during &amp;ay arid, it  is hoped that the MajoritySocial! ets and the Bourgeoisie would join the movement,Russia was to begin a  strong offensive  so as to occupy theattention of the &quot;Frie Korps&quot; a*4 Allied troops were  to  beallowed tc advance into Germany in  the  hope  that they might become infected with  Bolshevism.  Germany was to be  impressed with the fact that Bolshevism was  their only weapon  againstthe Entente.         The events of the past month  must have modifiedthe Be  plans, because  Russia could  certainly  not now  embark on a  &quot;strong offensive&quot;.         The position of  the Bolshevik Government in Muniohis precarious  aid  it  has  no support from the country districts  and  the  SparticiBts  generally throughout Germanyere short  of money.          The Bourgeoisie  of  the oocupied territory are undoubtedly dreading  the  day via en the  Allied Troops  mustwithdraw.    In their  present frame of mind it is  thought that  they would even welcome annexation if this was  the only  way In which their safety oould.be guaranteed.                                                  AUSTRIA/
 AUSTRIA               &apos; &apos;&apos;Vhe^*$tox*&amp;tea^xxJtt apr^has.  lightly&apos;Improved.  More       coal and food has been coming in and the news from Munich has       helped to convince, the population that a Communist regime       would be starved out in a very short time,  Dr. D3UTECH, one       of the mo ft advanced Socialists in the Government, pointed       this out at a meeting of the Soldiers&apos; Council.  On the other       hand, the Americans report that the Chief of Police is    *   pessimistic: crime ison the increase; grip is being lost,       owing tc the increased independence of the Volkswehr, who       are rapidly becoming a sort of Praetorian Guard and       lntimic!atii.g the Government.  The Italian demand for the       reduction of the Volkawehr has had a good effect,HUNGARY                Tho situation of the Communist Government is still      &quot; obscure: the Roumanian advanoe has affected its stability       ar^d shown the weakness of bill KLVs position.  The Red       Army has little discipline or cohesion and one division,       the Szeklers, is reported to be prepared to join the       Roumanians.  The peasants are generally against the       Government,  lyearly two million people have crowded in to       Budapest, where the normal population is about 900,000.       So far there seem to be no relations betweer^the Hungarian       and Ukrainian Bolshevists; on the other hand, there is a       danger that a further Roumanian advance may preolpitate       the opposition  towards Bolshevism.  If matters remain as       they are, a counter revolution may take place at any time.       The appearance  of Allied troops at Budapest would  be the       sigijal for a general revolt against the Bolsheviks,                The Bed Axny receives fcodt clothes end 4f50 crowns      - a month..yi; All officers up .jbo the rank of &quot;majors are to be  -       eiected/eyk the  troops and -the hi uherYranks;nominated by-the        v       .  -i   ...   &apos;.      &apos;h,iy       ..    .....   *          -ft,       Council of.

The  news issued by  one represents the  Bolshevik      rule as ideal:  this is to influence  the working classes in      Allied countries.   The other  agency gives  descriptions  of      Bolshevik excesses aid outrages, with the  object of      frightening the Peace Conference into granting better terns.ITAJJY               The internal situation in Italy has beon modified      by the wave of enthusiasm over the Plume question.  The reoeni      strike in Rome had little public sympathy, in fact the      placards of patriotic societies opposed to violence were more      numerous that, those of the revolutionary group.   Some people      think that the strike wa&amp; a &quot;dress rehearsal&quot; for a more      serlous demonstration on May Day,   Anxiety about the progress      of Bolshevism seems to be spreading in Italy and the      Bourgeosie are losing their oala..               The most aotive worker for Bolshevik propaganda in      Italy is i&amp;UiQKDQ PSLUkiO, a Socialist journalist, who is now      in Austria,  He is said to have received money from HOLGliANN,      Lenin&apos;s envoy.               The  Italian Socialist Party did not participate in      the Conference at Berne aid i e now officially attached to the      Third International in ttosoow.  The official Socialists are      now adopting  a programme of extreme Communism and  intend to      call a general  strike in support  of it.  This is the      greatest immediate danger to  the  country.BULGARIA               News from Sofia is disquieting:   it is reported from      an American source  that  the - Bulgarians  are  inclined  to follow      the example of Hungary,  The  Bukarest newspaper &quot;Universal&quot;      reports that  Hungarian agents have arrived  in Sofia  to      negotiate  on  a common course  cf action.                                                    RUSSIA/
     The position of  the Bolshevik Government is daily becoming more precarious, owing to the rapid advance of  3CQIiCE&apos;lK*s troops and  the Bolshevik failures on othor fronts.   Tho Bolshoviksere doing great damage in their   rotreat by wrecking railways,blowing up bridges and  destroying reservoirs and machinery.The peasants  of military ago are reported to bo enrolling1 them-selves voluntarily in KOitOMK1 s Army, and in tho liberatedtowns some enthusiasm is  being  shown for  the troops.    .Anti-Bolshevik risings are  reportod from many parts of  Russia andin Government circles in 3?otrograa. it appears  to be realised that the Government is  in a critical position;  ZIHOYIM^ has declared, &quot;The fall of Rea Petro r?.d means the end of  theRevolution&quot;.     In South Russia Bolshevism is assuming a less truculentform.   At Kherson General  C-R;X&apos;0ROIljJ&apos; declared against  theexecution of  the bourgeois,. &quot;Since Russia has need of all herintelligent elements&quot;.     There is good  reason for  believing the       has  lately been making overtures to  the German Government and that  theGerman reactionary party  has a definite  scheme for  allianoebetween Germany, Russia and  Japan.     The fighting value of   the Tied Army is rapidly deorer-sing,and in some places the Army  seems   to bo melting awsy.    TheBolshevik plans  for  a great  spring Offensive  are not  likely  tobe  realised.     Some interesting  details have  been received about theBolsheviks1 propaganda araoncst  their prisoners.    The  Britishrank and file  tolerated   the  lectures bocause  they were  alwaysfollowed  by a  good meal.   Six of  these prisoners  were recentlyreleased to  cajnyout BolshGVik  propaganda amongst  the  British       *troops j   a person who  saw one   of them - a  youn  private of theWest Yorkshires -  said  that,  if the others   were like  him, the                                                          more/
                                                           m more Bolshevik propaganda made in this way the better.   They- are also training German prisoners with the same object.            Mr, Coates, who was employed by the Bolsheviks  as  .Orchestral Conductor In one of the theatres, wad who left eight weeks ago, has given me some interesting details.   His Orchestra were required to be detached from polities, but owing to lack of food they gradually melted away.   If some cf them became bandpmen in the Red army, simply for the food they got, no notice was oaken cf it, but in one rehearsal when th ay.were asked to repeat a parent&apos; they explained that they were too weak, having had neither breakfast nor dinner the night before,             As relaxes Chaliacin ana Munlm Gorky he said that the former was oonsumed by vanity on hearing his own voice and was quite as ready to speak in favour of the Monarchy as of the Bolsheviks, Provided he could get listeners, and as the former subject, is a dangerous one he takes the Bolsheviks for hie text.  Gorky is a Social evolutionary, not a Bolshevik.  He took the position of Commissar of Literature in order to befriend the Intelligent.            The- Red army is mutinous and would turn against the Bolsheviks if food were to run short.  Money could not  buy food; everyone was cermanently hungry, if not actually  starving The only palliation was that peasants used oo sneak uc  the back stairoases and barter a few pounds of flour for a kettle; barter being now the current form of exchange.  With very  few ejections the peasants are against the Bolsheviks. *%B to prices, a m.ir of ladies&apos; boots oost the equivalent of   150, and 10,000 roubles a month was insufficient to feed a family, when ordered to the Finnish Frontier the soldiers boasted openly that they would orops It in order to gat food.   The Churches were crowded, and the Bolshwiks were making no further reprisals on the priests, who in some oases openly denounced them,                                        ,^  ,                                                        l rs./
          Mrs. Coabes added that there had been no real ohonge In the      Russians of the humbler olass, and that if order were restored      and food forthcoming, nothing would remain of the revolution      but an ugly memory.NORWAY          Some unrest is reoort^d from Norway, but the attitude of      the Extremists IF one of exoeotanoy and they are unlikely to      make any move except in sympathy with other parts of Europe.      Revolution is openly discussed and Tronjheim is spoken of as      the centre from whioh the country is to ha separated into two      parts and all connection with tlw South broken off.  The      authorities  think that serious unrest in England will be the      signal  for trouble.          The Norwegian Police believe  that Bolshevik propaganda      agents  are being financed  through the export of diamonds,      which are easier to  pmugglc  than rouble.   The stones are      Fold in Rotterdam txnd  the money used for  propa^anoa  purwes.          The frontier police have been strengthened, but  it  is      imoofoible  to  esti^blirh a  guard along  the whole  line of the      frontier and,  therefore, undesirable people are  likely  to      slip  into  the  country.   The  police  are  therefore  concentratingi      upon  obtaining severe  sentences  on  foreigners whose  passports      are not in order.I HOLLAND            In Government circles &quot;there is great uneasiness.   The      Army is not conpidered reliable and the Navy is permeated witft I     Bolshevik ideas.   Troeistra, who led the abortive revolution I      in November, Intends to&quot; go over to  the extreme Left and will       probably become the leader of that party.  The stoim oentre at 1    , the&quot;moment, is the Imtoh-German frontier, wh^re trouble isj I     exPc-ot-Jd on the First of May.  Government officials are boing -  ]     warned in a circular a^uinft inciting to disobedience to legal  I     authority;   there has been a good deal of insubordination lately  I    , in Government offices.                               on/
              On the other hand, the Chief of Polioe at Rotterdam la(  ^  .   far more optimistic  He sayp that at the reoent election of the       &quot;Provinoiale Staten&quot; the Socialists lost 50$ of the votes held       last year, and the Communists l/3rd.  Recruiting for the Civil       Guard iBurgerwooht) is going well;  in Rotterdam nearly 6,000       men have been enrolled and recruits are still coming in.  They       belong to the middle clashes, with a fair sprinkling of       labourers belonging to the different religious seotp.  Similar       bodies ure bein&amp; enrolled in all parts of Holland. SPAIN              The German charge d&apos;affaires denies emphatically that       the Syndicalist movement in Spain has been promoted by German       agents, but the Spanish Government is satisfied that this Is       the case, and two hundred agente have been arrested and are       about to be sent back to Germany via Holland.  There appears       to be definite evidence that obey were behind the Baroelona       strikes.  Von Carlowitz, alias Garriga, has been arrested and       a warrant has been issuad againpt Frederick Ruggeberg, who Is       alleged to have received a large sum of money from  Germany and       Russia.  Some of thip money was paid out to strike  leaders. PORTUGAL               According to a Prenoh report, the extremists in Portugal       have a definite plan of cutting the railways, pillaging houses,       murdering oolitioal leaders and dividing the spoils among their       supporters,  At the moment there ht.s been no outbreak. INDIA               The Soviet newspaper &quot;Pravda&quot; hus boasted that up till       November, I9I8, the Bureau of Musselman Communist Organisations       publiPhed four million copies vf propaganda literature in       Tartar, Kirghiz and Hindu.  A Bolshevist propaganda organisationj       is working at Moscow for propaganda in India, Persia and Japan,       printed in the vernaoular.  A branch office has been opened at                                                        Orenburg/

The Government of India is itself issuing A leafletexplaining the ftowlatt Aot, and vernacular leaflets are tobe oiroulated in towns arid districts.  The situation is now reported to be easier.         The situation is generally Improving and Cairo isquiet.  Daily reports of the proceedings of the NationalistDelegation to Paris show that the delegates are entertaintv.eand are caking a special effort to  capture the French press.They have to  some extent fallen victims to the allurementsof Paris, ai4 in consequence they are  in urgent need ofmoney.  They complain that though they called upon  thevarious Allied Delegations, only the  Italians returned theirvisit.  They  seem  to  be opening up  relation? with theEgyptian nationalists In Berne,  The  recognition  of aBritish Protectorate  by the Amerioans arid  the refusal  of recognition  at the  Peace Conference have been a  severeblow  to them.

CHINA           Bolshevik agents have been very active lately on the      North West frontier; they are trying to exoite revolution:      in KASHQARXA.  The Chinese Government is alive to the danger.IT. a, Ji?&apos; AkSHrlOAo           Bolshevism is reported to be almost entirely ocnfined to      persons of foreign origin, but there is a tendency on the      part of extreme radioals to palliate the proceedings of the      Soviet Government In tfusBia.  Apart from thi?, and the Hearst      newspapers, any recognition of the Russian Soviet Government      by the United states would outrage public opinion, and the      Government is apparently not  only  aware of this  but sincere      in its efforts to combat Bolshevism.   It is much concerned at      the moment about LUDWIG C.A.K. *iARTift-S, who was  accredited      by TCHITCHSRlliS last month as his  official representative.      kartens  is said to have  been  in England  in 1916, but we have      no trace  of him, nor in it definitely  known what is his      nationality.
