This question has been left  in  a very uns-atisi actor y posiiio.ru 4 It  seems to me that\ as v;e are  at present moving,  all  the measures&apos;; adopted under the stress of war will gradually be  abandoned and. we  shall simply  revert to the old state of things,      Meanwhile it must not be forgotten that  the policy of Controly Purchase and Local Option,  deliberately adopted by the Cabinet after long discussions  on May 31st 1917, still holds  the field.  It has never been reversed.  But, unless something is now done to give effect to it,  I  foresee  that successive relaxation- tions  of the existing control,  and  of the restrictions on the output of liquor, will render its execution more difficult if not impossible,  We  shall bo  reversing  our policy  in fact, although I am not aware that  the  Government has  ever reconsidered or  altered its position in principle, and although everything- which  has happened  since may  1917&apos; seems to me to strengthen rather than weaken the  case for the  policy which then  commended... itself to  the Cabinet.       It should be borne in mind,  that  the&quot;Xiquor Control  Board in  December 1916 reported to  tho  Government  that  although national efficiency had been enormously  increased through their restric- tions, there was still  a problem,  still a national&apos;loss connected with drink which could  not be  dealt with by mere restrictions so  Ion---, as the  trade remained in  private ownership^  . The  Control Board accordingly  recommended to  the government State Purchase of  the Liquor  Trade.       This  Report was the  starting-point of the  discussion, which  resulted in  the  decision  of  Kay 17th,  1917,  already referred to. At  that time  it  was certainly  in the contemplation of the. G-overn- ment to proceed  az  once with a Bill to give effect to that  decision.    Subsequently however it was decided that, before

The...Reports of those.&apos;Committees were received in Hovember- l-^l?     I)-6c6m^er 3-91-7,January 191$.   They are very exhaustive,- and show that theacquisition of those interests by the State is quite practicable.Indeed, &apos; in. my opinion,, apart from the political - and..social argu&apos;*ments in favour of the elimination of private interests, therewould be a large profit to the State.     Since these Repcrte were received, nothing has been done.There are two good reasons for this.   One is- that the year19L8 was the most critical of., all the war years.   Engaged  aswe were in a.struggle for existence, the thoughts  and  energiesof the Government were more than  ever  absorbed  by the  conductof the war,  especially,  on the Western Front...- The other reasonis that the  output of beer and spirits was so- reduced,  that therewas practically no drink, problem  and no loss  of  national health and efficiency due to drink. . . For the time being  the  question had, so to  speak:, settled  itself.     Now, however, wo are  clearly threatened  with  a return  ofall the old  evils.    It  is,neither,possible ncr  desirable tokeep the production of  beer  and spirits  at the low level  of1918   in fact  successive  concessions have  already  largely  in*Greased the  output.   We  are therefore . once more face  to  fanewith the problem  of minimising the  evils  of the  drink  traffia.Everybody  agrees  that  something ought  to  be, done to- preventthe loss of  all  that., the  nation gained during the  war  in  the  -reduction  of crime  due  to  drink,,  in  sobriety-, health  and  effi-ciency - but what?    The  answer,  I  suppose,  is  that wo shallmaintain  certain-restrictions.    They will inevitably be  lessstringent  than those  imposed.by the  Liquor Control Board  at the
interminable and titter really effective efforts to. prevent theabuse of liquor by imposing restrictions upon the  various privateparties who are interested in encouraging its sale, I think inought to make up our minds whether the only radical remedy for such abuse - the elimination cf private Interest In the    jof drink - which tve certainly contemplated and almost adoptedtwo years ago, is to be finally abandoned, and if so, why?dealt with by m&amp;T* s;estrictiens as long as the trade remains in private ownershi ,Before.we  ea3aKe once more in the old,MILKER.30th April 1919;,height of its powfciv*   ?,?)t that Board Itself has reported thatthere Is a nations,! loes connected with drink which cannot be
