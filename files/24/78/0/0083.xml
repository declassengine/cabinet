    THE intervention of M. Briand in the debate on the French  electoral system theother day has made people begin  to  think about the domestic  situation, present andfuture, of France.  Briand&apos;s appearance is universally interpreted as a bid for succession to M. Clemenceau, who is certainly not in so strong a position as he was at the  time ofthe Armistice.  The unsuccessful attempt to assassinate him did something to revive hispopularity, but even without that it would not have been easy to undermine  the greatposition he had gained in the heart of France, especially outside  purely political circles,by his courage, determination, and indomitable energy, which his great age renderedmore remarkable.   Even now there are no serious signs of his having lost hold of theChamber, though the Ministry has met with a few set-backs there.   Probably if ho- hadthe time or the strength to address the Chamber he would  easily recover almost all theascendency he had there six months  ago.  But the Peace Congress has robbed  him ofthe time and probably the  assassins bullet has robbed  him  of some of his strength.Moreover, the Peace Congress, with whatever reasons and  with  whatever justification,has certainly failed to satisfy public opinion in France  even more  than  elsewhere, andClemenceau inevitably suffers from its  failure.   The French know  little of the  rest ofthe world and invariably imagine,as maybe seen every day in the articles of their journalistsand the speeches of their Statesmen, that it is mainly occupied in casting admiring eyesupon  France.  They probably expected  that France would dominate the Congress and since  it has become clear that this is not happening, they are proportionately disappointedand vent their disappointment inevitably on the man whom they expected to make Franceits leader.  Moreover, the original difficulty of M.  Clemenceau&apos;s  Cabinet, that it was aCabinet of dummies, none of whom carried any guns except what they could borrow fromthe Premier, remains as visible as ever.   The financial speeches of M. Klotz have had the worst possible reception  in the Chamber, and there  is no  doubt that under normalconsiderations he would have had to resign.   His proposal to put a tax on capital hadall  the  air  of being thrown out without  any  serious  considerations of  the grave difficulties and objections  to such  a  tax, and without  sufficient  recollection of  the  factthat the French middle class is the most averse to taxation in  the world, and that itcould hardly be wise to  begin by asking it  to face the tax which  it was  certain todislike most of all and to have the soundest public reasons for disliking.     Briand, then, after his long silence, comes in and exhibits a  marked contrast to therather colourless unimaginative individuals with whom alone the  too forceful personalityof Clemenceau seems able to work.   He  made  the somewhat dull subject of the  rivalsystems  of dividing constituencies and voting at elections the occasion for  an outburst of eloquence, heralding the expectation of a new era in France.   The issue was the oldone between  scrutin d&apos;arrondissement,  the present system which is  that of  small con-stituencies,  and  scrutin  de liste, which is that of large  constituencies with many members.  The present  Chamber, elected in  1914, was largely  elected on this  veryquestion and on  that of Proportional  Representation,  an immense  majority of  its members being pledged to abolish the  present system.   Four out of the  six parties putProportional Representation on their  programmes, and of those elected, 529  deputieswere  pledged to scrutin de liste, while  only 19 were pledged to scrutin d&apos;arrondissement.The almost  universal feeling was, and is, that larger  constituencies would  deliver the member from what is even more conspicuous  in France  than in  England, his servitudeto  petty local interests  and  to the personal  demands  of individuals  who obtaininfluence in  the  town or small district which-  he represents.   It  is believed  thata  large  constituency  would  be  too  large   for  the  working   of these  sordidinfluences, and that its choice would  be guided  by ideas and principles rather thaninterests.   Still  many  deputies,  pledged  to   this  system   and  to Proportional       [1130] -5 67           MEMORANDUM                 ONTHE POLITICAL SITUATION IN FRANCE.CONFIDENTIAL:POLITICAL INTELLIGENCE DEPARTMENT,        FOREIGN OFFICE.

Representation, shrink from fulfilling their pledges and taking a plunge which  wouldinvolve their having to swim amidst the storms  of the  political sea instead of on their  ^own private pond, buoyed up by the air-belt of  a caucus of persons under an obligationto them.  The result is that a Commission, appointed to report on the subject, brought   &apos;$Jin a report which proposes to abolish the small constituencies in favour of much  largerones ; in fact, in future the  department would be the constituency.  It also proposes to abolish the secret ballot, and to institute  some  kind of modification  of the method ofcounting  votes, which  is  not Proportional  Representation,  though  it bears  someresemblance to it.   To this  system M. Briand gave  his support, while saying that hewould have preferred greater concessions to the principle  of Proportional Representa-tion. The most remarkable part of his speech did  not deal with any technicalities asto the systems of election, but  with his open conviction of the  failure of the presentsystem.   &quot;All,&quot; he said, &quot; must recognise that  the  further  we go the  less  public  lifethere is  in France.  Great  ideas are  shattered against the walls of  the constituency.Each deputy carries on his own little battle, and must serve the local interests to whichhe is obliged to turn for support in his election.   People will say that the  country asks for nothing, that it is calm.   But  is it calm ?  The country is in a state of stupor, stillstunned after the fearful battle which it has just come  through.  It has lost blood, it isweak, it is pre-occupied with what  is going to take place to-morrow.....what you imagine to be resignation or indifference is expectancy.&quot;     There can be little doubt that M.  Briand is right.  It is certain that  France, as she begins to recover her energies, will expect wider  political roads  to  walk in and demand a view over larger  political horizons.   The present Chamber is certainly  notpopular.  It is attacked by all sections of the press, and the demand for a change inthe  old  system  of  electing  it, and  especially  the  substitution  of  proportional representation, is  the  single subject on which such  papers as  the  &quot; Temps &quot; andthe  &quot; Humanite &quot; are heartily  at one.  Many  persons prophesy that the majority ofthe  present  deputies will never  enter the  Palais Bourbon again,  after the GeneralElection.   And foreign observers  report that  casual  conversations  overheard amongFrenchmen intimate that the deputies when they return to their constituencies to  aska renewal of their  election  are much more  likely  to be received with mud than withflowers.     If the change should  turn out to be a mere change of persons, it would have little importance  for foreigners.   If the existing type of member, who is largely given up tolobbying for personal c- local interests and often shows a  strange indifference to public affairs of the greatest importance, were replaced by men of much  the same nominalpolitical views, but of greater public spirit, France&apos;s Allies could only  rejoice.   Probablythis would have happened if M. Clemenceau had managed to arrange  a General Electionimmediately after the armistice;  then, at any  rate, it seem certain  that the nationalspirit, raised to its  height by the victory, would at least  have annihilated all the anti-national elements  in the same way as it  did in England.   In  fact,  the danger wouldhave been the other way, that  of  the election of a Parliament like the first Parliamentof Charles II, blind to  the  fact that victory alone cannot  permanently satisfy a nation and that waving flags and talking about &quot; la gloire et la patrie &quot; will  not for ever satisfya country which was asking  for reforms before the war, and needs far more and not  lessafter her tremendous experiences.     This danger is, however,  probably removed by the delay of the Peace congress and the practical  certainty that the Peace  will be  something of  a  disappointmentto  the  exaggerated  hopes  of  France.   Will  the  reaction send the country  in  theother  direction?    It  has   been  fashionable  to  prophesy  all   through  the  war,and especially since  the Russian revolution, that  when elections took place theywould everywhere  produce  great victories  for the  Socialists  or the  Extreme Left.There  have  now  been elections  in  Spain,  Norway,   the  United States of America,England  and Germany,  and  in   every  case one  of  the  most conspicuous featureswras the  defeat  of the Extreme  Socialist  Party.   Is  there  any  more  reason tothink they would be victorious  in France than elsewhere ?  Electoral prophecies, even when made  by prophets who  have lived in the country and  been occupied with itspolitics all their lives,  are  notoriously of  very doubtful value.   And when they aremade by foreigners their value is obviously even more uncertain.   Yet foreigners cannothelp taking the facts  as  far  as  they,can see them and forming estimates  of  the  0probabilities.   If  we do  this  with a  full consciousness  of the precariousness of anyconclusion to which  we  may come, we shall  probably believe that France is at least assafe as any nation from the  danger of a victory of extreme Socialism.   There are several reasons for thinking this.   First of all, France has probably a greater sense of unity, and
     .a  stronger consciousness of national life  than any country in the world.  There  is a     story of a woman who waited for her husband among a number of prisoners returned v  incapacitated from Germany in the middle of the war, and seeing all  come  by without(N   his being among them, asked where he was and was told he was dead, on hearing which     she raised her baby in her arms and  cried &quot; Vive la France !&quot;   That could hardly have     happened in England, perhaps not in  any other country in the world.  And its possibility     is  due not  merely to a certain  theatrical  element in the French  character, but to a     genuine passion for France, who is loved as a lover or a mistress, after a fashion, to which     there is probably  no  parallel  in Europe.   This feeling  can hardly  fail to have been     intensified by the agony of the last four years, and it  must act against  the Socialist     Party, or,  at  least, the Left wing of that party  who  before,  during  and since     the  war have  made  themselves something like the apologists of Germany  and have     always shown far  more indignation and found far  more  space in their  newspapers  for     protesting against the real or imaginary faults of French statesmen and generals, than for     denouncing the crimes and abominations committed by Germans in the occupied districts.     It seems certain that, as in England, this attitude will prove most unpopular with the     electors whether soldiers or civilians.   Then there is another  thing.   If the accident of     geography had led to the war destroying the south or west of France and left the north     and east untouched, the Socialists  would have had  a better chance, for  their  influence     is  naturally  greatest in the industrial districts.   But  it  is precisely the  industrial     districts  of France which have  seen the German in his true character, and  experienced     war  in all its hideous reality ;  facts  which must certainly render them less  inclined  to     listen  to those who  follow  Marx  in trying  to  substitute  internationalism,  led  by     Germany, for  the  historic and almost personal reality which  they know  and love  as     France.  And if they do not  turn  Socialist, who will ?  Mot  the  peasants, who  are     before all things property owners.  Already one Socialist deputy, with a knowledge of     the peasants, has been warning his party that all  will be lost if they do not repudiate     the  Bolshevists.   The great sub-division of property in France, and the  very large     number of owners of the  soil,  should, it would seem,  make it  the  least likely of  all     countries to accept the tyranny of a Bolshevist urban  proletariat.   So much for  the     peasant?.  But it seems certain  that there will  also be a strong feeling  among  the     soldiers.   They will  surely resent the complete  silence of the Socialist press  about     the great General  whose genius did more than anything  else to  bring their trials and     sufferings to an end.  And they will hardly feel friendly  towards the only party whose     newspaper offices put out no flags for victory when victory came.          Moreover, the Socialist  Party must be  weakened  by its  internal schisms.   Since     the  last  Congress  the  majority  who  control  the  official  party newspaper, the     &quot; Humanite,&quot; consists of the  old so-called minority, which  is the Left or international     wing of the party.   They are opposed by the active group of the &quot; forty &quot; (who, in fact,     are now forty-three) deputies, who, for  the most  part,  opposed  the recent  Berne     Conference,  and are actively opposed to Bolshevism, pacifism, and defeatism  of every     kind,  This  section  generally votes  with  the whole  party in the  Chamber,   It     did so, for instance, the other day  on the question of intervention in Russia, and has     shown no great strength in separating itself from the policy of the rest of  the party in     the Chamber.  But Varenne, its leader, is believed to be one of the ablest  men in a     party  which  has very  few  men   of  ability,  and  his  group  assert  in  private     gatherings, where  they would be presumed to speak something like the truth, that they     are confident of gaining ground in the country.   Whether this be  so  or not will  be     uncertain till  after the election.  It may  be that the  future will  show  this group     turning somewhat away from official Socialism and approximating  to the  Socialist     Radical Party; but at present they have in no way modified their doctrine, and declare     their intention of carrying on a vigorous propaganda among the  Socialist Party.   How     large that Party is is very doubtful.   It polled a million and a-half votes  at the last     election, but even after all the efforts which have been made in the last  six months  to     increase  the regularly affiliated members of the Party,  it. has only been possible  to get     them up to 36,000, which seems a neglible quantity, and is only an increase of  2,000  on     last year.  A similar effort made for the sale of the official newspaper had, in January,     only  gained 300 new subscribers, though there was a large increase in casual sales, and     this increase is said to progress rapidly since.   Of  course  those who  subscribe are the     keenest members of the Party, and, as is always seen in Labour and  Socialist organisa-     tions, a small number of extremists is  often able to  carry the majority, though its policy     is often repudiated at elections when  it is  exposed to the silent, secret, and universal     judgment of the  ballot.  In any case, the international wing  of the French Socialists     seem to be committing themselves  steadily to a more or  less  extreme policy.   To the
pro-Germanism which  they always exhibited, and still exhibit,  at  every opportunity,.they have now added pro-Bolshevism.   M, Longuet, their leader, for instance, not onlyuses almost incredible language about the crimes of the war, as  if all the belligerentswere quite equally guilty of them, but he and  his Party almost continually gloss overall the horrors and  crimes  of  Bolshevist rule in Russia.   He and  his  friends at theSocialist Congress at Berne succeeded in preventing any real judgment being passed onBolshevism at all, and it is doubtful  whether Thomas, who had the courage to go there and make a vigorous denunciation of Germany and of  Bolshevism,  was wiser than, hiscolleagues of the &quot; 40,&quot;  who declined to have anything to do with the Conference which,in fact,  is  generally admitted to  have been  a  complete  failure.  The fact is thatLonguet and Co. are in a very difficult position.  They are really bourgeois intellectuelsthemselves, exactly the type that  Lenin and Trotsky detest, and  all  their apologetics of bolshevism have not up to the  present got them anything but kicks from Moscow.And they  are also placed between two tires at home.  The Extreme Socialists  of the-Federation of the Seine,  the sort of people who recently elected Lenin and Trotsky vice-presidents, are Bolsheviks pure and simple of the most violent type, and the consequenceis that it  is  very difficult for the Socialist  deputies, who still at intervals assert  in theChamber that they are not  Bolsheviks, to manage these gentry.   In fact, there havebeen several very stormy  meetings in Paris at  which Longuet and his friends wereabsolutely  howled down by the Bolshevik section.  On one of these occasions he  got soangry  as to  declare that  his opponents were une poignee d&apos;anarchistes.  But he hasbeen playing  with fire  for a long time and he ought not to  be surprised if he finds hisown house in flames.    To sum  up then, it seems that the public spirit of the peasants with their interestin property, and  the  temper  of the  bulk  of the  French nation with its individualism,especially in money matters, are  almost certain to resist any attempt of the Socialiststo carry  the country.   And the national feeling among  all classes, and especially amongthe returned  soldiers, will be a  strong influence against a party which is, like  itsfounder,  practically international,  and really cares nothing for France, as distinct fromother nations, at all.  The  only chance they will have is by appealing to  the syndicalistspirit,  and  the demand for  higher  wages and better conditions  among the  urbanworkers.  But here again  it  seems doubtful whether the political profits of these verynatural aspirations will go so much to the Socialist Party as  to the popular LabourParty  of the Confederation generale du Travail, which holds a good deal aloof from theSocialist Party and recently, for  instance, refused to mix up its meeting at Berne withthat of the Socialists.   Changes in labour conditions there no doubt will be in France as elsewhere,  but France is not so highly industralised a country as to make ii likely that industrial  questions will revolutionise  the  political situation of the country.  On thewhole  the probability seems  to  be that the future Chamber will not exhibit any verystartling rush to the Left.   Its greatest need will probably be outstanding men to leadit.  At present Clemenceau stands alone with Briand as a probable successor,&apos; but whoelse  is there ?  In France,  as  elsewhere, democratic politics seem to throw up a numberof men  of moderate capacities but to produce even fewer leaders of the first class thanthe Parliaments of fifty and one hundred years ago.
