H.S.Syrett,                                                 Secretary.       Meeting of the Consumers&apos;  Council at Palace Chambers,,Westminster, on the 9th April,  1919.                       Extract from proceedings.  Mr. T.W.ALLEH:-  As Deputy Chairman of the Council may I endeavour  in a brief word to express to you what I interpret to be the mind of  this Consumers&apos; Council with regard to the continuance of the Food  Ministry as a Department of State,  First of all there is no general  desire on the part of this Consumers&apos; Council -if I gather their views , aright- that control should he maintained for the purpose of keepingI  this Ministry alive or in existence just for that simple purpose alone,  but they do view with some degree of alarm the efforts that are going o  to scrap this Ministry entirely, and cause it to cease to be as a Finis  try by November 15th next.  They recognise that, with all the faults cf  the Kinistry of Food, and with all its failures to accomplish complete!  the task for which it was designed, yet it has been the one Department  of State that has had the confidence and blessing of the consuming  public.  The consumers have looked to this Ministry of Food for pro-  tection, and I believe it is correct to say that they have not looked
in vain, but they have not ceased to look either to this ministry or to the Government to protect them with regard to the future.You must be aware as FOOD Controller that, during our 4k; yearsexperience of control there has grown up in this country a most powerful system of Trusts and Combines and Associations and vest-ed interests whioh are a real menace to the State at the presenttime.   It is against these that the Consumers&apos; Council feel thepublic should be protected and instead OF scrapping this Ministryentirely, they feel that i&apos;t should undergo a degree of reformthat would make it a really useful permanent Department OF State.The consuming and labour interests of this Consumers&apos; Councilfeel that the one interest which is not being safeguarded andprotected as it ought to be is the consuming interest - thatthere is too much anxiety - perhaps on account of either pressure on the part of the &apos;&apos;ar Cabinet or of the vested interests in theHouse of Commons and trade interests without, to dissolve this1 inistry and that all that is good is going to be scrapped forthe time being,   Of course freeing the trade may be the bond-age of the consumer, and there is a fear that freedom of trade,as interpreted by the trading Interests of this country, is desired only by that one particular interest.   This Council isinformed by the documents which we are now about to considerthat whatever is necessary or remains to be done by this Ministryshall be done by some other Departments of State.   For example,milk is to go to the Ministry of Health, and the question of&quot;ensuring standards of quality may go perhaps to the Board ofTrade.   &quot;eights and measures may go to the Local GovernmentBoard, AND thequestion of&quot;&quot;statistics also with regard to food prices may go to the Board of Trade&quot;&apos;1   If I know the feeling ofthis Consumers1 Council aright, they have no confidence In anyOne- of these Departments really to protect the consumer, and what they are asking you this morning, Mr. Roberts Is that you should consider the advisability, not so much of scrapping this ministry of Pood, as a Ministry of Mood, but of converting it into an even more useful Department of State - that matters which are now carried on by other Departments of State pertain-ing to food supplies should be brought under one Ministry -call it by what name you will - that there should be one Depart-ment of State;  and that it should have a measure of controlover production of produce, whether It be wheat, or whether itbe milk; that it should have some control with regard to distrib-ution and supplies, and that it should have authority with&quot;&quot;regaOT^^H&quot;cea*lLnd standard of quality as well.   &quot;&quot;hat they desire to askyou is that a case really should be put to the&quot; ar Cabinet itself., not for the acrapning of this Ministry, butfor its maintenance in some useful form in the interests OF theconsumer, and for the consumers&apos; general protection, and thatthose articles of food necessary to life which are being dealtwith by other Departments of State should be transferred to thisDepartment of State - call it by what name you like - the Ministryof Commerce, of Supply, or of Production^   It does seem that a department of State is necessary to protect the consumer, both with regard to supply, with regard to sufficiency of produce,with regard to home production, and to standard of quality, andin respect to proper weights and measures.   I do not know whether I have Interpreted the Consumers&apos;Council aright, but they do want some indication from you in the directions 1 have mentioned, and they feel at the bottom of theirhearts that all the good is going to pass away;  that by passingthese things over to various Departments nothing will come ofit ultimately.   Now is  the time and opportunity in this new world we want to see created to create for this country someDepartment of State that will protect, the consumer, and see thathe has good food at proper prices, with power to enquire Intocosts in all directions, and direct and advise the Government
so that it may have a proper policy from time to time withregard to the feeding of the people,   I would go further, and say that there ought to he protection in other directions.  To-day, for example, if you want to putyour boy bad: into civilian clothing, the suit which cost yourlad three guineas before he went to serve his country, now:,, upon his return into civilian&apos; life, costs him nine guineas.  But Ian only pleading now that a beginning shall be made, that thereshall be a  Department which shall protect the consumer in thedirection I have indicated.   He iteeds protection in other directions than food.   I would like to add that it is not only that this Council hasnot confidence in these other Departments of State, but itviews with apprehension the division of functions that will takeplace if the present functions of the Ministry are divided between different Government Departments.  It is scarcely worththeir while to deal with, one article, or one phase of the foodproblem.   You cannot expect the Board of Agriculture andFisheries to deal with fish in all its ramifications - all theycare about from the fishery point of view, is that certainrights shall be protected with regard to inland fisheries, butthere is a great problem in the harvest of the sea which is notlooked after by any Department of State which could well beharnessed to this Department.   Take the waste and great expenseof these Government Departments;  take tho Local GovernmentBoard, which is supposed to look after the rat plague of thiscountry.   v&apos;e have It on the highest authority that there areas many rats to be fed in this country as there are human beings,and that they are being fed at a cost of 20 millions a year.  Ifyou can save a quarter of that cost by a iilnistry which is looking!after matters pertaining to waste of food^ you would save thewhole cost of this Ministry, even from that point of view  andI thin!&quot; that if the Cabinet did look at this problem from theconsumers1 point of view rather than from the trade interestspoint of view, they would see that there is a good case foj a  &apos;&apos;Ministry of Supply or Food, for the protection of the consumer.
