Two out of the 12 cases were disposed of to-day, in  which the accused were found in possession of property looted from the National Bankof Amritsar.   In one case  nine accused were  sentenced  to  seven years&apos;imprisonment and one to three years&apos; imprisonment;  in other case 10 menwere sentenced to  seven years&apos; imprisonment.  It appears that rural popu-lation have taken little part in the recent-disturbances except along railway lines in  some places.   A satisfactory feature is that the  returned  emigrantsappear to have held  themselves  aloof.   Loyal  meetings are reported  from various  places in the  Gurgaon  district.  Lyallpur reports serious dacoitywith a loss of Rs. 50,000 near Jaranwala.&quot;    All quiet in  Delhi, Ahmedabad, Bombay, and elsewhere.(IT 975/1SIX
