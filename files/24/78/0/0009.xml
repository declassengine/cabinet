WINSTON  S.  CHURCHILL.    Numerous demands have from time to time been received by the War Office fromGeneral Officers Commanding-in-Chief in Theatres  of War, and from various BritishMissions, for assistance for Allied and Enemy Countries.    The Supreme Economic Council has been set up in Paris  to deal  with  thesequestions, and it  is thought th cL u  fill I  dsiXlElIl ds for supplies,  whether food or  other commodities, should be addressed to this Council, who should be responsible for taking such action as they consider desirable.    It is, therefore, proposed that the following procedure should be instituted :     (a.)  In  the case of Governments possessing accredited representatives in Paris,General Officers Coramanding-in-Chief in Theatres of War, and  the  various BritishMissions, although keeping the War Office informed of the situation,  in order that thequestion whether any military interests  are involved may be considered, should on thereceipt of representations from such Governments, notify them that the matter is solelyone for the Government in question  to take up with the  Supreme  Economic Councilthrough its own representatives in Paris.    (6.) In the case of Governments or Countries not so represented in Paris, appealson behalf of such received by the War Office from General Officers Commanding-in-Chief,or British Missions, will be immediately referred to the Supreme Economic  Council bythe War Office.    In  both cases the  Supreme  Economic Council should decide whether food ormaterial is to be supplied or not, should make all necessary financial arrangements, andshould communicate direct with  the Government Department concerned, the  WarOffice only entering into the transaction if it is desired to do so by  such GovernmentDepartment.    As regards surplus Army food stocks, the War Office  will periodically report tothe Ministry of Food such stocks as are surplus,  and should it be  decided  to affordrelief,  it will be for the Supreme Economic Council to approach  the Ministry  of Food,and not the War Office.  The Ministry of Food will inform the  War  Office should anyof the articles reported  surplus be ultimately required.    The  Ministry of Munitions(Disposal Board), who are also informed as to the surplus Army stocks, should be kept in touch with the situation by the Ministry of Food.(Bl 9/197)  70  4/19  H&amp;S  7059wo
