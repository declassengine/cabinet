The Chairman referred to the decision arrived at in Minute 4    of the proceedings of the 9th Meeting, and  said that lie understood    Mr. Harms worth desired to reopen the question.        Mr.  Harmsworth said  that since the  9th Meeting lie had had    correspondence with the Chairman on the subject, pointing out that    his advisers were dismayed at the decision that had been arrived at,    as it was felt that it would mean the dissolution of the blockade.    He pointed out that the Allied Blockade  Council  had considered    a resolution to the effect that certain  important categories of goods    such  as raw cotton, cotton  manufactures, AVOOI  manufactures, yarns    and  silk should be derationed  for the northern neutrals, and had    communicated it with a favourable  recommendation to the Supreme    Blockade  Council  in Paris.  Again,  a  largely extended Free  List    had been prepared.  Curiously enough a communication from Paris    had  crossed that of the Allied  Blockade Council, stating that the    American Representatives were proposing that restrictions imposed    by the Associated  Governments upon trade with  Norway, Sweden,    Denmark, Holland, and Switzerland  should be  suspended.   This    proposal had yet to be considered, and therefore he thought  that-519                                                     B
the  operation of  the  resolution of  the  Conference  should  be suspended pending the decisions of the Supreme Blockade Council,and particularly having regard to the fact that in a very short timethe blockade might be removed.     The Chairman asked Mr. Harmsworth whether, in view  of thegeneral  desire for the relaxation of the  blockade, so far as thenorthern  neutrals were concerned, he thought that there Was any danger in putting the resolution into force.     Mr. Harmsworth replied that he  would like time to consider thepoint.  He was not in favour of the American proposition which hehad outlined.  It was clear that the Supreme Blockade Council must consider  both proposals.  He himself saAv no objection whatever tothe  resolution in itself,  but  hr;  could not assent to  it, havingregard to the ulterior effects it would have.  If it was brought intooperation, the whole of the Inter-Allied arrangements would have tobe reviewed, and while this might be welcomed by the United States,he did  not think  it would  be so in the  case of the other associated powers.    Sir  Alexander  King  pointed out  that the  chief trouble  wasobtaining guarantees against  re-exportation, and. this would not beremoved  by derationing.     The  Chairman said that the position was getting very seriousin this country  from the point  of view  of  unemployment  andtrade stagnation.   He had  no doubt whatever in his own mind thatthe resolution should  be  given  effect  immediately.   The UnitedStates were taking steps to re-establish the International Chamberof Commerce, and  were making  great  efforts  to  obtain  tradeconnections in Europe.   It  was only  proper, therefore,  that ourmerchants should be given every opportunity of re-establishing theirown  connections, and of wiping out the bad effect that had been produced  by their inability to execute orders.  The Conference  had full Cabinet authority  to take a decision on the matter, but as theForeign Office were  not  able to agree, he  felt that the only  action that could  properly be taken having regard to the urgency  of thequestion was for him to telegraph^ to  the  Prime  Minister that night, putting the case before him, for his decision.    2. The Chairman referred  to the Memorandum (U.A.S.T.18) bythe Foreign Office, drawing attention to the fact that the blockademachinery was being used for commercial or  industrial  purposes,and not solely for the purposes for which it was originally instituted.    Mr.  Harmsworth stated that  this  strictly was not a blockadequestion, but he understood that the machinery of the blockade wasbeing used for ulterior purposes,  particularly  in the  case of  wool,and those in  charge  of  the blockade were receiving the discreditthat attached.   He believed that the recommendations made by the wool Council were made on behalf  of various elements, both labourand manufacturing.   He felt strongly that the use of the blockadeshould be  limited strictly to war  measures,  and that this was apoint that should be cleared up.    Sir  Arthur Goldfinch pointed  out that lists A, B, and C, reallyhad nothing to do with the blockade authorities.  He understoodthat the policy of the Government was, in deciding what restrictions should or should not be  imposed,  that  the position in this  country should be examined  from the point of.view of both employment and of scarcity of the material in question.   The Wool Council was a body  appointed by the Government to make  recommendations  tothem.   When the  Sub-Committee  of  the Conference, which had* The contents of the message sent are reproduced as an Appendix to these Minutes.The Use of theBlockade for otherthan war purposes.
been appointed to consider the  relaxation of  restrictions on exportswas sitting, one of the main governing points before  them was thescarcity of the particular article they were. considering; and thatwas a policy that  commended itself to the Wool Council.   TheCouncil had definitely  come to the conclusion that the exportable surplus was  very limited,   The point, therefore, seemed  to  he-whether they were correct in adopting that policy.     Sir Alexander King said he agreed with Sir Arthur Goldfinchin principle, but he thought that wool waste and rags should be puton  the free list,  and yarns and noils,should go on list C.  Whatthey wanted  to get rid of was the licensing. system, which  was agreat encumbrance.     The Chairman  said there was no question but that  the scarcityin any particular commodity had to  he taken into account, but he asked if  anything had  been done to free wool for export.     Sir Arthur Goldfinch said that he did not think that there was any objection to freeing wool waste and  rags, but if the export ofnoils was permitted, there would probably be a shortage of hats.In  regard to yarn,  he pointed out that  we used to  have largeimports from  Germany, but that Germany would  not be  able nowto export yarns, and therefore  it would be foolish for us to export.He also pointed out that the Bradford spinners were in a difficulty,owing to  the  French not having carried  out their contracts.   InOctober last, at the urgent desire of France, backed by the UnitedStates, yarns had been freely exported to France at a considerablesacrifice to the rest of our  export  trade ; and now France was,technically, restricting  the imports of yarn.   The  spinners, there-fore, felt that to obtain proper protection, it was  both necessary  and desirable to have  a British   guarantee as wrell; and the WoolCouncil therefore decided, having regard to  the lack of protectionthat had been afforded to  spinners  during the war, that the exportof yarns to France should  be  restricted.   The spinners wanted toprotect their contracts.  It is  true that employment was bad, buthe did not think that the removal  of restrictions  would affect that part of the situation materially.     Colonel Amery said that it  seemed to  him that the best way tomeet the difficulty would be to  impose an ad valorem licence fee inthe  place of  the present licensing  system.   This would  be auto-matic, and would save a  lot of irritation, and at the same time would meet the point raised by Sir Arthur Goldfinch.     Mr.  Chapman agreed that that would be a  better method, buthe questioned whether  it quite  met the case.  He thought that incoming to any  decision on this matter the  attitude of the labour members  of  the Wool Council should  be borne in  mind.  Theywere strongly of opinion that any relaxation  of  restrictions on  theexport of wool would  have deleterious effects  on employment inthis country.     The  Chairman  asked Sir  Arthur  Goldfinch  what the  result would  be if  it were decided that  the  arrangement that had beencome to for  the protection  of the Bradford spinners should be terminated in a month  hence ?     Sir Arthur Goldfinch replied that any such decision would need to make  all commodities the subject of  export, as the principle  had.been laid down that scarcity was to be taken  into consideration.As a matter of fact he believed the lifting of  the blockade and  the consequent scarcity would,  in the long run, be a good thing for  the wool industry.  If,  however, such  a decision  were taken, he  feltthat great irritation would be caused in the trade.   The  actualeffect would be that there would be a  scarcity for three months;and he thought it would also reflect on the state  of employment.       [1205]-519                                    B  2
He emphasised the fact that there were no reserves of wool to speak of.   It was true  that the world&apos;s supply of wool was greater thanthe pre-war supply, but we were  not getting wool quickly.   It waschiefly in Australia, where  there were  over  1,000,000 bales, and in new Zealand where there were  about 500,000 bales.  There wastherefore enough in sight  for 1919 to  supply the needs, but it hadbeen estimated that at the end of  1920 the consumption would be greater than the supplies.     The Chairman said that the following points had emerged fromthe discuBsion.  So far as  could be seen, there were sufficient woolin ,the world  to  meet demands,  but because of a probable  localtemporary  shortage in  Europe,  the Wool  Council  desired  tomaintain control.  Haw wool, including tops and noils, appeared tobe properly on list &quot;A,&quot; but there seemed to  be no  reason whywrooi waste and rags should not be freed from control.   As regardsyarns, the position Avas that the Wool Council had decided  that therestrictions on exports should be maintained, not because the exportof yarns would in any way  be undesirable from the point of view ofunemployment in this country or otherwise, but because it would,in the opinion of the trade, prejudice the spinners  in this  country who had entered into contracts with the French.which had not beencarried out, and it was hoped that the  licensing system would giveprotection  as  an English guarantee would be obtained  as well as a french one.   It appeared that the Labour part of the Wool council were of opinion that the free export Avould react  unfavourably on employment  in  this country, but he  understood that  Sir  ArthurGoldfinch was clearly of opinion  that  the only reason for retaining the restriction was  to protect the  financial interests  of Bradfordspinners.     He asked Sir A. Goldfinch  if this was a correct  summary ofthe position, and suggested that the Minute should be agreed before a decision was announced.     Decision reserved.                                    (Initialled)       A. C.  G.     2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,          April 11, 1919.
APPENDIX.         Sir Auckland Geddes to Sir Maurice Hankey for the Prime Minister.     IMMEDIATE decision required reference trade with northern neutrals.  Goods ofclasses described at end of  this message bought by northern neutral merchants beforeimposition of embargo held up in this  country many months. . Neutrals now orderingfrom America on ground that British merchants have been paid for goods which theyrefuse to deliver, fact being Foreign Office refuses allow  delivery on blockade grounds.Value of goods affected small, not exceeding 15 million.  If permission to deliver these goods not given immediately British merchants  undoubtedly lose to America  manyorders, when blockade removed.  Both as Acting President  Board of Trade and as  minister responsible  co-ordination  trade  policy  urge  immediate removal  of  these restrictions  which, after hearing  all  evidence  available, appear to me nO  longerwarranted.  Agreement impossible this end.         &quot; All yarns, piece  goods, and other  manufactures of  cotton, wool, linen, jute,     and silk, in respect of which :          &quot; (a.) Orders had  at any time been placed in this  country by neutral countries                  and payment has been made.         &quot; (6.) Orders  were placed in this  country by neutral countries before the                  embargo was put on their export, whether the goods have been paid                  for or not, should be treated as  if on the free lists.&quot;o
