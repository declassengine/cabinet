Horticultural Advisory Committee.

At a meeting held on the 15th instant, the following resolutions were submitted to the Board:-

(1) That the importation from Holland of Horticultural Plants and Bulbs, which are or can be grown in this country, be prohibited except by licence granted by the Department of Import Restrictions, Board of Trade.

(2) That until 31st March, 1921; licences to import Peat leaving plants, Evergreen Shrubs, Peek Plants, Roses and Ornamental Forest trees, issued only on exceptional ?, as for example new varieties and varieties unobtainable in this country.

(3) That the following bulbs, Hyacinths, ?arly single and double Tulips, Crocus, Spanish Iri?, Glad?, Chinadoxa and Soilla siberica shall be admitted under a general licence, but that in the case of all other bulbs, and until March 31st 1920, licences to import is issued only in exceptional cases, as for example new varieties and varieties unobtainable in this country.

(4) That the Horticultural Advisory Committee shall have an opportunity of considering from time to time the subject of restriction of imports of Horticultural plants, etc., with a view of confirming or modyfying the above recommendations.

(5) That in the granting of licences regard shall be had to the extent to which the constructed home industry is capable of meeting the requirements of this country.

Chamber of Horticulture.

At a meeting of the Insecti? Committee, which was attended by representatives of the Board, agreement was reached with regard to recommendations for the standardisation of the following:-

Arsenate of Lead, Lime of Sulphur, Spraying Soap, Cyanide Compounds, Nicotine, Copper Sulphate, Liver of Sulphur.

Cultivation Section.

The Swanwick Fruit Growers&apos; Association is in a flourishing condition, with a membership of over 400, the average holding being 5 acres. Some of the smallest growers support themselves and their families on 2 acres of strawberries alone.

A meeting of the Women&apos;s Institute, Potters Bar, was attended, the chief item being soil working and manuring of cottage gardens. The need for improving the condition of fruit trees and bushes, by cleaning, spraying, pruning, etc., was fully explained, and the audience who numbered 70 ladies, displayed a keen interest, numerous questions being asked.

Visits have been paid to market gardens and nurseries in the Bridgwater dist?. At one garden of about 1 acre with two comparatively small glass houses, the holder has established a good mail trade in seedling tomato plants, mainly to trade growers, 100,000 plants have already been sent out this season.

The Anglesey Bulb and Vegetable farm shows a turnover of £6,000 for the past year. The farm depends a good deal on women&apos;s labour, which is very satisfactory.

The supply of stocks of Dutch bees ordered by the Board arrived safely in England on the 12th instant, and distribution has been affected to the Apiaries set up by the Horticultural Sub-Committees participating in the Bee-Restocking Scheme.

A definite order for an adequate supply of Italian Queens has now been placed with an Italian Queen breeder, and it is hoped that they will arrive in this country during May and June.

  
In view of the disparity between the requirements of baskets for this season&apos;s crops and the capacity of output of British basket makers, as a result of which serious difficulties may arise, the Board are asking the Department of Import Restrictions that licences should be issued for the importation of Dutch baskets to the extent of one million as a first instalment.

Small Live Stock.

The termination of the activities of the National Utility Rabbit Association has led to enquiries being made as to whether the Board advise the further keeping of ?ame rabbits. Correspondents have been assured that the Board still advocate this industry being continued.

The interest shown in the Board&apos;s proposals to promote poultry keeping is very great and a large amount of correspondence is being d?alt with.

? Section.

Inspection of Land. A visit was paid to a farm in West Sussex, in connection with a proposal for its use for purposes of dairying instruction. The farm, which consists of 50 acres permanent grass, 84 acres of arable, and about 30 acres of heath, scrub and ?, was taken over by the Agricultural Executive Committee in February, 1918, owing to its neglected and impoverished condition. A considerable portion of the land had gone to bush, and a large field of about 40 acres had been allowed to turn mainly to bracken and heather. About 20 acres of the latter was cleared and broken last summer and sown with winter corn (cats and rye). The rye is a nice, thick crop ready for folding off; the cats partially failed, and have been "mended" with spring corn. The rest of the arable land is in process of being cleaned and brought round, but some time must elapse before it is in the requisite heart and condition. The grassland is a poor and starved, and needs suitable manurial treatment; some of it is wet and in need of drainage. As regards the "bush" the Committee have already broken the clearest portions about 20 acres, of the remainder, 11 acres of useful soil known to have been successfully cultivated many years ago could only be cleared at considerable expense, and it would seem that under present conditions the limit of profitable reclamation has been reached. Many of the hedges and trees bordering the arable land have been out close down and temporarily replaced by dead material neatly interlaced between uprights. Many new gates have been hung, but much still remains to be done to make the fences stock-proof.

Trial of new types of Seed Drills. A great deal of interest has been evinced during the war, with its resulting shortage of labour, in certain new types of drills, particularly in types which combine the sowing of seed and manure in one operation. In one of these a manure box is attached to the ordinary Smythe drill popular in the South-eastern counties. "Combined" disc drills of American make are already in fairly common use. There is reason to believe that the smaller quantity of manure required when these drills are used in as effective as the normal dressing sown broadcast. Another type is the ?unn drill. This has three box attachments fitted to sow respectively seed and artificials in the row and lime on top. The drill coulters are spaced wider apart than is usual, and the coulter itself is also fairly wide, thus distributing the seed in a broader rut than is possible with the ordinary coulter and disc drills. Besides economising seed the wide rows give ample ? horse hoeing. Trials of drills of these types have been arranged this year in Essex.

Seed Testing Station. - The number of samples received at the Station has now reached 20,000. Cereals have almost ceased but Root and Vegetable seeds, especially Mangels, are still coming in in large numbers. The germination of new Mangel seed is net as high as that of last season&apos;s crop.


factor Section.            During the week ended the 4th inst, 1,433 tractors were in  commission and 0,200 acres were ploughed and 7,534 cultivated giving an  average cf 5.72 and 5 .26 acres per tractor respectively,   More than a  third of the tractors were at work&apos; and bad weather kept them idle for a  quarter of the time only,   The acreage ploughed was about a third more  than in. the previous week whilst the acreage cultivated was more than  three times as much.   The highest acreage was dealt with in Norfolk  where over 1,000 acres were ploughed and 500-cultivated:  the highest  average acreage was recorded in the Holland -&quot;Division of Lincolnshire,  *48 tractors ploughing 247 acres (average 5,15) and cultivating 1.692  (average 35,25).            In 7ales&quot;1,100 acres were ploughed and 107 cultivated by 204  tractors, giving an&apos; average acreage per tractor of 5.40 and 0.52  respectively.   More than half tho tractors wore in commission.   The  amount of work denu was practically tho same in each case as in the  preceding&quot; week although 26 more tractors wore at work.   Bad weather  prevented work for one-third of the time.  , The largest acreage was  done in Glamorgan whore 217 acres were ploughed by 32 traotors (average  6,78) but Carnarvon again headed the list, with an average of 10;50  acres for six traotors.            During the week the proposals of the Gloucester Committee to  dispose of all their f7 tractors at the end of May were approved,   The -/number cf tractors to bo retained after Lay is&quot;now approximately. 1,200  out of a total cf 3,700.

It  isreported from Surrey, however, that demobilised men have displaced womenmilkers in several instances. &apos;  County Secretaries are engaged in making enquiries as tc the probable labour position during the  summer months,in order to ascertain the number of women workers likely to be required,          An interesting example of ,.a woman1s skill in motor  tractordriving comes from Cumberland.   A member of the Land Army had beendriving a -orDson tractor for a time when the  supervisor was  unable tcreplace a man in charge of the Clayton, a tractor v,hich  is much more powerful and difficult to handle, and decided to try the woman.   SinceTHE END of last year she has done all the work with this machine  whichIS USED for a threshing outfit.   She is earning full man1s wages,  and doing the whole of a manr&quot;s work.   The supervisor for the district &apos;Carlisle) said that he could not speak too highly of her work,  and;fully agreed that IN the efficiency tost which she had just undergoneshe should receive lOOf of total marks.     &quot;Tomen&apos; s institute a .

Various experiments have been  carried out by direction of the Admiralty in devices for protecting  trawlers against the danger cf -live mines which may be taken in the  trawl.   Certain methods have been tested with unsatisfactory results,  but recently a new device has been tried which consists of a wide-  meshed net covering the whole of the mouth of the trawl.   The  purpose of the. net is to prevent mines from entering the bag of the\  trawl while at the same time permitting free entry for fish.  Preliminary experiments are said to have been successful and a  conference has been arranged to be held next week at which the  Fisheries Departments, trawler owners and fishermen will, it is hoped,  be represented, to consider the practicability of adopting thist&apos;j  latest device.   In the meantime further experiments are being i  conducted.J            There is nothing else of special interest to report.I                           Intelligence Division.

As in the greatmajority of ouch cases the Local Authorities concerned have hithertofailed to take any steps for redemption,- it is not unlikely that theissue of the circular in question-may cause a considerable increasein redemption business,   This Board have supplied the Local GovernmentBoard with 6,000 copies, of their Instructions for Redemption to accompany the circular.
