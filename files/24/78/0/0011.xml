Sir  W.  Brunyate has been informed confidentially that                it is not the intention of the Government to renew the                purchase  and control scheme after July 31st  but that it                is undesirable to make any public announcement to  that                effect at the moment. :3.ETEffl)E  TO         As a result of the winding up of the Ministry of BOARD Off  TRADE  Munitions  and the  limitation of the functions cf  the M OPTICAL     Ministry  of Supply, the Optical Munitions, Glassware,. ITIONS.&quot;GLASS-  and Potash  Production Department of the Ministry of I &amp; PQTlSH      Munitions and the &quot;Jinx Control Board are  being transferredKGTIOft         to the Board of Trade.        AM)IEL                     The  water Power Resources Committee  have  presented IE EfflBB*        &amp;n Interim Report which has heen published.    As a result                of preliminary surveys which they&quot;have made  the Committee                are/able  to indicate&quot; nine areas In Scotland  in which a                total of  160,000 continuous lup. could be developed  on a                commercial  basis, and the energy transmitted to the                industrial  districts.     The Committee express the opinion that such ,-feterPowers should be regarded as national assets, and shouldbe either developed&apos;by the State or leased to public or commercial undertakings.   They suggest that if anyof the schemes mentioned are to be begun at once, with aview to employing labour in 1919, the (rovornme-nt shouldpromote a short Bill riving- the- Board of Trade powers toacquire the necessary rights.     The Report is receiving careful consideration bythe Board of Trade, and the Ministry of Labour and theScottish Office are being consulted.
PUBLIC SERVICES MMWimm ION.       fae &quot;Board of Trad e; at the reauest of the Ministryof ^hipping-, have recently undertaken the work oi survey and provisional registration of the German sains sur-rendered under the armistice.  /. small number 01 these have been dealt with in the ordinary course at  jonaonaril Liverpool, but for various reasons most of  olio snipshate had to be sent to Leith.  Over 50 ships are now atthat port.     In order to enable so large a number of ships to bedealt with at one port, normally not a busy one, ithas been necessary&quot;to transfer a number of the  BoardTsSurveyors from other ports.     Sufficient staff has now been provided to  cope with the work notwithstanding the pressure of ordinaryTffprk on the depleted Survey Staff, and the surveying&quot;of the vessels&quot; is being&quot; proceeded with as rapidly asthe conditions and facilities of the port will  permit.     during the later stages of the -.?ar-j the Board of Trade(Marine Department ) Oiitport Staff assisted theMinistry of Pood ana other Departments interested&apos;incontrolling foodstuffs and articles of which there wasa shortage,  by restricting the quantities taken on boardshi$s at United kingdom ports as &quot;ships&apos; stores.Relaxations have now been made in this control  on thefollowing&apos;lines, the relaxations coming- into operation at the end of rarch:-   British and Allied ressels are      I now free to take such supplies of food-stuffs aid otherships1 stores as owners consider necessary, except whengoing to countries near fi-ermany.   Neutral ships&quot;going to countries near Germany are kept under, similar strict con-trol in this matter;   neutral&apos;ships going to other des-tinations are recuired to obtain approval from  Board ofTrade Surveyors of the quantities proposed to be shipoed,but except where there is an actual scarcity of the article &apos;in this country supplies are allowed without restriction.     The negotiations between the Railway ExecutiveCommittee and Representatives of rhe National Union ofHailwaymen and the Associated Society of locomotive engineers and Firemen in regard to the cuestion of conditions of service of railwaymen vhich were  referredto m tne Report for February have been continued aidprogress has been made.
IMPORT RESTRICTIONS.      During the month the  Imports Consultative Council was reconstituted  out of the  Import  and Imports Consultative Council lately  presided   over by Lord Llmmott.  Sir Sanuel  Hoare  was appointed Chairman  of  the new body which has been strengthened  by the  addition of  members representative  of all interests.  The Council has appointed five Sub-Committees, and will shortly appoint a sixth.   Kach of  the Sub-Committees is  to (teal with a separate group of articles.                PA?^R CONTROL..

In accordance with  Authority  received from the Treasury the system  of payment whereby one half of the cost of each invoice from Sweden  was paid in  cash and the other half compensated in  the  shape  of &amp;fc Treasury Notes was brought to an end  with  the month of   March.,      It has been decided to appoint a Committee representative  of both Producers   Consumers  and Labour  toge tiler with three  Government Representatives to consider means to obviate  the  closing of paper miljs owing to tlie  relaxation  of the restrictions  on import.      On the&apos; 31st March the re mining  restrictions on timber were  withdrawn, with  the exception of the pitwood Order  1916, in accordance  with a notice issued on  5th March,     .To safeguard the  position and prevent inflation of prices,  large  forward purchases were made, with Treasury sanction  before the  control was entirely removed.   Detailed particulars  of  the  f.o.b  Purchases from Scandinavia have been prepared  and-offers invited for  purchase  subject  to obligation to bring in  die  Timber  to  United  Kingdom.  Stocks  are  now being taken  of  the remainder&apos; of imported timber in  the  United Kingdom belonging to trie  Department as well as  details  of the  Canadian pin-chases, and these  will be  offered  to  the  trade in clue course.      Arrangements  have been made to retain under the j;oard  of Trade,  the winding up of the  Trading Account side  of  the Timber Supply Department fs work.&apos; Only such standing timber  purchases as are  decided to be really  surplus  to  operations of that  Department  are being dealt with under Surplus Disposal&quot;Board arrangements.  The Controller of Timber Supplies is also Controller  for the disposal of surplus&quot;timber,  and this will facilitate  the  carrying out  of the  arrangesments made.                      (4)
