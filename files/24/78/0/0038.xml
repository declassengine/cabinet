Appil.....1910.        As a result of the elections to the Esthonian ConstituentAssembly the parties of tho &quot;Left&quot; appear to havo obtained adecided majority, and it is reported from a reliable sourco thatthe Esthonian Government are prepared to make peaco with thoBolsheviks.         According to reports received on 16th and 17th April theGermans, professing a fear of Bolshevism, raided the LettishHeadquarters, and took the members of the Lettish Governmentprisoners,. with the exception of     Ulmanis, who took refuge withthe British Missian-   The Germans disarmed all Lettish troops inLibau, but the fate of those at the front is not known, ascommunications are cut.         Two German pilot vessels embarked guns and soldiers., andthe British Senior Naval Officer required their disarmament underArticle 23 of the Armistice, and he has been authorised to sinkthem if necessary.   Tho vessels were reported disarmed on the17th instant.         Tho Lettish Government having been overthrown, theGermans have announced a Military Dictatorship.   Von der Goltzdenies complicity, and states that these attacks, wore notauthorised by him, but there is little doubt that the coup c^etatwas prepared by the German Command.         The S.N.0. , Baltic, has placed under guard the Lettishsteamer &quot;Senator&quot;^containing arms and ammunition.                            ADRIATIC         The Admiralty has informed the Foreign Office that theBritish naval forces in the Adriatic are not sufficient to repressany serious disorders which may occur  in Dalmatia, following theannouncement of new frontiers by the Peace Conference, but that under present policy it is not possible to reinforoe them.         800,000 tons of coal is definitely allocated for ship-ment to Italy during April, if tonnage is available.                         If&amp;XSiUrEAN&apos;         There is a report from Turkish sources of the Italianshaving landed a few men at Makri and at Budrum.         The gulf of Mersina is now clear of mines.

The choice of port is to be made within three months.BLACK SEA
BLACK SEA AND DANUBE.         The evacuation of Odessa has been coripleted withoutseriou3 filling.   British subjects were evacuated by. theRussian transport &quot;imperator Nicolai&quot;.         General Denikin has asked tho French  to transfer theRussian Volunteer force, which evacuated Odessa, to Novorossisskinstead of to Sevastopol, as was originally suggested.         The Bolsheviks onterod Sevastopol on 16th April afterslight resistance^ and the French Vice Admiral is negotiating withthem.    R.-A. Black Sea has gone to Sevastopol to watch events.A * suspension of hostilities until inidriight 25th April has beenarranged between the Allied and Red Armies.

It hasbeen learnt that the Turkish destroyer &quot;Yardigar-i-Milet&quot; was sunk in Stenia Bay in July 1917 as the result or an air raid.    The ship is now in dockyard at Constantinople in abadly damaged condition.         Affairs at Osmanieh W/T Station are now satisfactory.  TheFrench and ourselves each have the use ofit for 12 hours out ofthe 24.         On April 15th two motor launches were remaining at Buda-post to organise tho withdrawal of neutrals if necessary.Admiral Troubridge has asked permission to go to Budapest with powers to negotiate as he is convinced there is yet time toprevent what is an Hungarian National Movement becoming purelyBolshevist.   Navigation of the Danube is? in his opinion,., thebest means of effecting an  amelioration in the economic positionand restoring normal conditions in Hungary.                          CASPIAN.         Astrakhan is reported to be open to  navigation-    a convoy of ammunition ships has left Baku for  Guriev to  render assistance to the Ural Cossack forces.

TheGermans now report that the delivery of the submarine pressuredocks cannot be&apos;made before&apos; April 26th, owing to a shortage  ofcoal for the tugs.                    -         Germany has been informed that&apos; an International MineClearance Committee has been established in London, but that itis not at present intended that. she should send a representative.If she desires to communicate on the subject she is to do sothrough A.

The following is the now area  in  which  fishing can be permitted:- .  Eastward of a line drawn 15 miles East of the Free Channel light buoys as far North as Lat.  54*45 N* , thence along this parallel to 4. East the no o following, the line of Free Channel light buoys to Dogger Bank Noord Light Ves-sel, thence along Meridian 5 degrees East  to  Lat. 57.40 No ,  thence along this parallel to the Danish Coast.   Fishing is also permitted in the Baltic and in tho Oattegat to the Southward of Late 57.10 N.          Ten additional German Merchant ships were handed over during tho week, and the nuribera which have now arrived in British  Territorial Waters are as follows:^-          Por British .....  102 out of 227           &quot;  French.......   30  11  &quot;   32       .  -  &quot;  TJ.S.A.......  ^J3  &quot;  &quot;  J.2                             24.0        271 The sub-corinission dealing with this question has returned to England  to give a complete report in detail regarding the out- standing questions of food ships still to be handed over.          In view of the German attack on the Lettish government permission which was given on April 15th for supplies to be forwarded to the German Army in Latvia provided Germany did nothing  to impede the recruitment or organisation of Lettish troops ,  has been cancelled.          The present position of the Blockade is as follows Germany  is permitted to export to Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Holland  and Finland all articles which are not on the prohibitod list.    The question of export of articles on the prohibited list  over which the Allies have pre-emption rights is still being discussed.    The Germans can import foodstuffs and other articles which by Allies agreements with Norway, Sweden, Denmark,  Holland and Finland they are specially permitted to import-    The I&quot;A*T*C&apos;s in the Northern Neutral countries are empowered to license such articles for export to Germany, and the Germans can ascertain all details by applying to those bodies.          Traffic to and from Germany may be &quot;carried-oat in Neutral  vessels who must carry an I.A-T.0.  license, or in German vessels  under 1600 tons gross, who must carry an I. A.T. C. license on  tho inward voyage to Germany.   As regards coastal voyages on tho German coast line, Germans may employ ships under 15C0 tons gross in this trade, but vessels carrying coastal cargoes or cargoes  consisting in part of goods for coastal distribution will not,bo permitted to touch at Neutral ports.         The Germans are required to furnish A.N-A.C with lists. of  vessels they propose to employ on (a) Coastal trade (b) Trade to  Neutrals.   If it is intended to use a vessel on both trades, permission should be asked for each individual voyage.   As regards  German vessels between 1600 and 2500 tons gross, such vessels  are not permitted to sail at present until the completion of  discussions now going forward as to whether or not they are to be  handed over to the Allies.         The &quot;Germans have asked to be allowed to use Seaplanes e.t Libau against the Bolsheviks,  but permission has net boen granted.                           EAST AFRICA.

                    SOUTH AMERICA.         Aj3erious strike of whaleiaGu  at So.  Georgia,  likely to lead to bloodshed, has been reported by the Colonial Office;  andit is under consideration to send &quot;Newcastle&quot;  to So.  Georgia  at end of May, when the whaling season ends, to preserve order.                    CHINA STATION.         Bolshevik armed bands have been causing trouble in thevicinity of the Suchan coal mines near Vladivostok.   They are believed to have been supplied from the coast, and H.M*So  &quot;Kent&quot;has proceeded to America Bay to assist the Volunteer Army troopsoperating against them.         The steamers &quot;Atreus&quot;, &quot;Novara&quot;, and 11 Nore11 have allleft Port Said with repatriated Germans for Rotterdam.    The&quot;Antiloohus&quot;, bringing others, has left Singapore.    About 100more will be repatriated from Shanghai as soon as a further shipcan be sent there to take thorn.         A considerable number will, however, remain; including some 500 women and children who belong to Prisoners of War in japan, some 300 enemy subjects at Tsirigt.au and an assortment ofmissionaries and teachers.    The disposal of the first two groupsrests with Japan who will be guided by the decision of tho PeaceConference.   The last group has been exempted by the ChineseGovernment as the result of the representations of religiousbodies backed by tho UoS.A*, but there can be no doubt that manyof its members are unable to distinguish between religious andTeutonic propaganda.                       FRANCE.         Contrary to last week&apos;s report it is now stated that the&quot;Courbet&quot; did not go ashore and has not been damaged at all.         An unpleasant incident occurred on the arrival of the destroyer &quot;Bouclier&quot; at Brunsbuttel on 12th April^   She had given the German authorities 24 hours notice of her arrival and intention to proceed through the Kiel Canal, but the Germansrefused to let her go thrcu$i.  Moreover she reports that whileproceeding down the river she was fired on by rifles from the shore.   The &quot;Bouclier&quot; was allowed to proceed the next afternoon,after having been held up for 16 hours, and an explanation has beendemanded from the German Authorities as tc the circumstances underwhich she was fired on.                       SPAIN.         The s*s. &quot;Manuel Calvo&quot;, originally reported to have been damaged by a mine, is now known to have been sunk, and about a hundred lives were lost.    The Spanish Government have requisitionedthe &quot;Montevideo&quot; to transport a furthqContingent of undesirableRussians from Barcelona,,   She will also take on board the survivors  from the &quot;Manuel Calvo&quot;.                          japan?..
