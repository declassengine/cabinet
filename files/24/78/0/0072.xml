In most European countries, with the exception of Russia, and even in the UnitedStates, the signing of the armistice appears to have acted as a signal for intensified agitationon the part of labour to  bring about an early, drastic and permanent reduction in thelength of the working day.   As a rule,  this agitation has found expression in a demandfor legislation limiting hours of labour to 8 per day, or 48 per week.   A short survey ofthe progress made towards the  realisation of this  ideal in the chief industrial countries may not be inappropriate at the present moment.    Countries in which, whether before  or since the armistice, the legal 8-hour day hasbeen introduced under the influence of a revolution,  namely, Soviet Russia,  Finland,Germany, Austria, Hungary and Tchecho Slobakia may  be  omitted from consideration.The  following Note, therefore, deals with those countries only in  which the movementmay be  said to be  proceeding under normal,  or  almost normal,  political conditions,namely France, Italy,  Spain,  Holland,  Switzerland, the Scandinavian countries and theUnited States.France.    In France the Government has been obliged to  yield to Labour and Socialist agitationfor the enforcement by law  of a  general  8-hour day (or 48-hour week),  at any rate to theextent of introducing an 8-hour Bill in the Chamber of Deputies early this month.  Thatthe Government acted under pressure is evident from the fact that the Labour and Socialistdemonstrations  of the 6th April were so promptly succeeded by the publication of theDraft Bill (Temps, 9th April).   (C 1762)  150 5/19  H k S
     The Bill lays down the principle of 8 hours actual work per day or 48 hours per week for all industrial and commercial undertakings and for brain workers as well as manual workers provided they are dependent  on a wage or salary.  The manner of  applyingthis principle will be determined by Ministerial Orders issued from time to time for particulartrades or occupations or for particular groups  of these.  Such Orders will be issued eitherupon the initiative of the Ministry concerned presumably  the Ministry of Labour orupon the demand of organised labour or organised employers.     The process of introducing the new legal  working day is to be gradual, and its com-pletion cannot fail to encounter additional delay owing to a provision under which the ministerial Orders for applying the new regime will have to take into consideration existingcollective agreements, e.g., where these permit of a longer working day.  It is obviousthat the  drafters of the Bill are here  deferring  to the recent objections of the Frenchemployers&apos; representatives (on the  Joint Commission on  International Labour Treaties)to the proposed introduction of the principle of an 8-hour  day into  the Peace Treaty.One of these objections is noteworthy.   It claims that as a result of the war France has suffered a loss of labour power one and  a half times as much as Germany, two and a halftimes as much as Belgium, three times as much as the United Kingdom and Italy and56 times as much as the United States of America.    Agriculture does not come within  the scope of the Bill which, however, accordingto M.  Cachin (Humanite, 9th April),  labour in France is  accepting as a first instalmenton account.    It would be surprising if such a Law as is now contemplated were to reach the statute book without further pressure from organised labour, since the French legislative machineis notoriously subject to breakdowns when dealing with any drastic new  departure in social  legislation.    For one important group of industries, however, the danger of strikes  for enforcing the 8-hour day may be considered to be ruled out by an agreement reached on the 17thApril and covering the iron and steel,  shipbuilding and  engineering  trades throughoutthe whole of France.  This agreement  provides for the introduction in principle of  the 8-hour day as from the 1st June, 1919,  except in the case of continuous trades, for whichthe date fixed is six months after the signing of the preliminary peace.Italy.    In Italy the ideal of the 8-hour day  seems  to be in rapid process of achievement.Not by means of legislation,  however, but in virtue of concessions which are being made(frequently with expressions of reluctance and dismal foreboding) by organised employersunder threats of strike by organised labour.  It is not without interest to note that LabourDay,  the first of May, is very frequently being  chosen  as the date from which  the  new regime is to take effect.  This is true,  for instance, for the  whole of  the Italian textiletrades (cotton, wool,  silk) as Avell as for the metal and engineering group (except blast-furnaces for which the 1st July has been adopted for the time limit).  As regards  thecotton and the metal and engineering trades the agreements include provisions for ensuring that weekly earnings shall not drop below the level at which they stood before the reductionof the working day.  For the woollen and silk industries negotiations on this point arestill pending.    Finally it would  seem that efforts to achieve the ideal of the  8-hour day are havingsuccess even in the domain of agriculture.  Thus the Tribuna of the 4th April reportsthat a Conference called by the Standing Committee of the Higher Council of Labour andcomposed of representatives  of farm managers and agricultural workers have appointed a Commission on the question of the 8-hour  day in agriculture, which  Commission hasdecided as follows :-    &quot; 1. Working hours in agricultural work for labourers hired by the day (men and           women) shall be eight per day.     &quot; 2. In view of the fact that in agriculture  there may be special needs due to  the           season of the year and to weather conditions, overtime shall be allowed, under           certain conditions if no  other labour is available, and  shall be paid an extra           percentage.     &quot;3. Further, the time of beginning  work and the intervals may be regulated according           to circumstances and cases in order that labour may be used to the best possible           advantage always within the limit of eight hours.&quot;  .    Other subjects discussed were the application of the 8-hour day in work on the mezzadriasystem, that is, the system of farming in which the tenant pays part of the rent in produce,the question of workers under a contract and of rice  cleaners, but no agreement  was concluded on these points.
Spain.    What appears, prima facie, to be a most drastic and comprehensive 8-hour law has just been enacted in Spain.  According to Article 1  of this measure the maximum  legalworking day (from the  1st October next) is to be 8 hours (48 hours per week)  &quot;fw alllabour.&quot; Joint Industrial Councils are to be set up before 1st July and these will be requiredto submit to the Government before the 1st October a list of the industries &quot; which oughtto be  excepted from the 8-hour rule on the ground that it is impossible to apply that rule in their case.&quot;    Having secured all the  data necessary for forming a judgment, the GovernmentDepartment charged with  the  administration of the law will have to decide definitelybefore the 1st January, 1920, the length of the working  day to be fixed in the trades tobe excepted.    Joint Industrial Councils which have not notified the Department to the contrarybefore the 1st October, 1919, are to be regarded as having accepted the 8-hour day.    So far as the building trades are concerned, the  above  measure had already  been anticipated since the 23rd March of- the present year by a Royal Decree issued nine  daysearlier, fixing a maximum day of 8 hours for those trades.Holland.    A most comprehensive Bill (it contains no less than 99 articles) for regulating hours oflabour in Holland was introduced by the Dutch Minister of Labour in the Lower Houseof the  States-General a fortnight  ago.   It covers employment for wage or salary in practically all occupations (except  agriculture and domestic service) in  which hours oflabour are not already regulated by special lawT such as dock and wharf labour, mining,stonecutting and a considerable part of the railway and tramway services.    For factories, workshops and offices it is proposed to  limit the working day to 8 hours and the working week to 45 hours.    For shops,  restaurants,  hotels  and hospitals corresponding limits of  10 hours and55 hours are proposed.    [It is of special interest  at the present time to note that the Bill also proposes theprohibition  of night work  in bakeries  of  all kinds.  For this purpose  the  &quot; night&quot; willextend from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m.]Switzerland.    Considerable progress  along the road to the 8-hour day has been recorded in the swiss  Press since the signing of the armistice.   This  is being achieved mainly by thestrength and  insistence of organised labour in its  dealings  with organised employers,and so far there appears to be little prospect of federal legislation for enforcing an 8-hourday.    At  the beginning  of the  present  year  the  largest boot and shoe factory inSwitzerland, employing about 5,000 workers, reduced  its working hours from 55^- to48 per week.  Since then several other important industries have followed this example.Thus, on the 17th April the &quot; Journal de Geneve &quot; reported the Chamber of Swiss ChocolateManufacturers as announcing the adoption of a  48-hour week as from Easter, 1920.  Inthe same issue of the &quot; Journal &quot; it was reported that the employers&apos; association of the swiss engineering trades had  ratified an agreement concluded with the  Trade Union,under which the 48-hour week is to be operative from the 1st October next, &quot; or sooner ifthis measure is adopted by France.&quot;    According to the &quot; Journal de Geneve &quot; of the 16th April, the Bale Association ofRibbon Manufacturers  decided, on the 28th November, 1918,  to introduce the 48-hour week &quot; as soon as this reduction shall have been adopted in foreign countries.&quot;  In report-ing this the &quot; Journal &quot; adds,  &quot; Now that Germany, Austria and Italy have decided tointroduce the 48-hour week, and France is on the point of taking the same  step, the BaleAssociation has decided to introduce the new regime in the course of the present month.&quot;     [According to the &quot; Zuricher Post &quot; of the 12th April, an agreement to introduce the48-hour week throughout the whole of the Swiss textile industry from the 1st May,  1919,has been reached at a  Conference between the  organised employers and workers in theindustry.  There is, however, no confirmation of this announcement.]     As a result of negotiations between the Swiss Breweries&apos; Association and the organisedbrewery workers, the 48-hour week is to be introduced from the 1st October.  From the 1st May to  the  1st October the hours are to be 50 per week.
 Scandinavian  Countries.     The subject of an inter-Scandinavian 8-hour law is shortly to be discussed by a Congress which is to meet at Copenhagen, on the invitation of the  Danish Government, and. is to  consist of representatives of the three  Scandinavian countries and  Finland. This demarche on the part of the Danish Government may, perhaps, explain the absence of any scheme for separate legislation on this question in Denmark.   At any rate, the Danish Press  contains no reference to any recent Bill on this subject.  Meanwhile, how- ever, Sweden and Norway are studying the question, each for itself.  Thus, a Bill drafted by the Swedish Government proposes a working week of  48 hours for industry generally, the  maximum duration of work on any day to be 8f hours.  It is proposed that the law be made operative from the 1st October next, except for continuous  trades, for which the time limit  of April or June, 1920, is contemplated.     In Norway what may be called the framework  of an 8-hour law is actually on the&apos; Stature Book, and has been,  in fact,  since the 14th August  last,  when the King was empowered to prescribe, &quot; With regard either  to specific  kinds of trades or to individual trades.....that the ordinary working time of a workman  shall  not exceed 8  hours daily or 48 hours weekly.&quot;  So far no reduction of hours has been effected under this law, which,  moreover, will cease to be  operative 12 months  after  a general peace has been concluded.     The Government have recently tabled a new 8-hour Bill, details of which are, however, lacking. United States.     There  is little prospect of legislation being enacted in the  United States in  the near future limiting the hours of labour of adult males in industry generally.  For this purpose it would be necessary first to amend the federal constitution, and  next to get  a  ruling of the  Supreme Federal Court declaring such legislation, even on the part of individual States, to be constitutional.  Apart from these obstacles, it would be necessary to over- come the  rooted objection entertained  by American organised labour against invoking legislation  as a direct means for securing better conditions of labour for adult workmen. The attainment of a real (as distinct from &quot; basic &quot;) 8-hour day has, in point of fact, been for  many years one of the chief demands of Gompers&apos; Federation, and so successful have his  Unions been in this respect that at the present time a week of more than 48 hours is rather the exception than the rule in most of the skilled trades in America in which male labour preponderates.     The textile  trades can hardly be said to answer this description, but even  in these the employers are now being forced to accede to the demand for a 48-hours&apos; week.  There is said to be an equal desire on the part of capital and the Government officials  to grant practically every demand of the workers so long as strikes  are averted and settled, and the spectre of Bolshevism got rid of,     An award made in February by the War Labour Board of Chicago granted the textile workers a 421-hour week of five days an award which was thought to have had much influence in ending many other textile  strikes  which were in progress at the time.  The Chicago Board was stated to have been largely influenced in its decision by the  belief ofthe  employers themselves, who  declared that the  workers must have shorter hours or&apos;&quot; industrial chaos would grip the country.&quot;                   PART II. DEMOBILIZATION AND RESETTLEMENT.Work of the Employment Committees and Employment Councils.    In a recent issue of this report it was shown that the functions in their origin purelyadvisory of the Employment Committees and Employment Councils had been expanded to include definite administrative duties.  The local Employment Committees associatedwith the Exchanges had been made  responsible for deciding on claims for an extensionof the out-of-work donation,  and the Employment Councils for the administration ofthe Retail Business (Licensing Order), 1918.    These admimstrative duties have been performed so successfully that a further stephas been taken in the same direction.  The Employment Committees have been calledupon to inquire into the  position of  adult civilians who are in receipt  of unemployment donation under the original scheme.  The inquiry, which will be carried out on the  same lines as in the case of applicants for extended policies, is intended to determine whether the
 conditions of the donation scheme are fully satisfied, i.e., whether the donees are persons normally employed, genuinely seeking work, and unable to obtain it.   This scrutiny is to be carried out as rapidly as possible in the case of all adult holders of civilian policies.  In the first place, however, it is proposed to review the cases (1) of those who have been repeatedly submitted for employment without  being placed, and so would normally  be  considered unplaceable ; (2) of those who were employed for less than 26 weeks during  the year 1918, and may therefore be regarded primd facie as not normally employed; (3) of married women who,  in many cases, may not be available for full-time work ;  (4) of persons over 70 years of age who may be incapable of work under ordinary conditions;  and (5) of those who were not registered as unemployed and seeking work when the scheme came into operation, and who were unemployed for four weeks or more before  they first  registered after that date, in which case  there may be ground for suspicion that the  applicant is  not genuinely seeking work or normally was not employed.  The  Committees are empowered either to withhold the donation or to  shorten the period for which it is available.  In view of the opinions expressed by many of the Employment Committees as to  the need for greater stringency  on the part of the Courts of Eeferees, it may be anticipated that the scrutiny will generally be carried  out with thoroughness. The Department, however, retains the right  to review the decisions of the  Employment Committees and to ask for their recon- sideration where necessary.    These  added powers may be expected to increase the value of the  Committees.   In addition to the administrative duties entrusted to them, the  Committees and Councils have  direct powers of negotiation in cases of local difficulty, and these have been employed in many cases  with considerable success.    For example, difficulty has frequently arisen from the occupation of business premises for Government purposes, and in numerous cases the intervention of these local bodies has been of great value.  At Swindon the Ministry of Munitions was induced to expedite the return of  a factory, which  provided immediate occupation for a  hundred  women workers.  At St. Albans, where 500 girls had been thrown out of employment owing to a fire, and were receiving out-of-work  donation, other premises  were  quickly secured, which hitherto had been in the possession of the  Army authorities.  In Fulham the return of a warehouse to a firm of  paper  manufacturers enabled them to  carry out their pro- gramme of reconstruction and secure employment for their pre-war staff and for a number of new workmen.    Difficulties with regard  to the  supply of raw material or  other products necessary for  employment have  often been overcome.  Thus, in the Welsh coal mines it was con- sidered that one cause of the decrease in output was a deficiency of trams and similar equipment.  The Employment  Council  passed  a resolution  urging the removal of  all priority restrictions on the provision  of material for the equipment of coal  mines, and the matter having thus been brought to the notice of the Coal Controller, the priority procedure complained of was withdrawn. The binder twine  industry, which  affords the staple employment for women in the Tyneside district, was at  one stage in serious diffi- culties owing largely to keen American competition  and to  the accumulation  of stocks in England.  At the end of  March 600 workers in this industry were unemployed, while further dismissals were expected which would have raised the number to 1,100.  Through the instrumentality of the  Northern Employment  Council  negotiations were arranged between the Board of Agriculture, the employers&apos; association and the farmers interested, and a solution of the difficulty was  arrived at.   Further unemployment was prevented. and the employers who had  closed  down  their  mills expect  shortly to  restart work.. The Lewisham Employment Committee were able to  assist a firm of biscuit  makers to  obtain  raw material necessary  for their  post-war  work.  Tramway repairs  in Glasgow being delayed through the slow delivery of rails, the staff of the  Employment Council were successful in negotiating considerably  increased deliveries.  In Perth  the Employment Council and the local Employment Committee  were successful in obtaining concessions in connection with the rationing  of coal in the dyeing and cleaning industry which enabled the principal local employers to absorb all their old employees returning from  His Majesty&apos;s Forces, and to engage a  considerable number of  additional women. Similar difficulties were overcome at Inverness.    Special interest has been shown in many cases on the question of road repairs.   represent- sentations made by the Northern Employment Council as to the necessity for the release of quarry men was followed by the addition of these workers to the priority list for release. A deadlock between the owners of stone quarries at Titherington. and the  Control Com-mittee was overcome successfully, with the consequence that  the quarries were re-openedand about 180  men were re-employed.  At Brighton arrangements were made with themilitary authorities on behalf of the  Employment  Committee for handing  over  huts    (C 1762)                                                                   B
\                           PART III. PRESS COMMENTS.                           (/). Labour and Socialist Press.                     (A). Peace Conference and&apos;Foreign Affairs.     Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s Statement in the House of Commons seems to have aroused neitherenthusiastic approval nor outspoken condemnation in Labour  journalistic circles.   Infact, it is hardly commented on at all.  The general impression is that it gives no ground for faith in the redemption of the Premiers election pledges (this, of course, being treatedas a matter for rejoicing or reproach according to the particular colour of the individualpaper), and that on the all-important questions of the nature of the peace terms and ourdealings  with  Russia it throws no light whatever.  In the absence  of fresh information,the Labour  papers have little to say this week  about affairs abroad.Russia and Bolshevism.     The time has gone by, says the &quot; Call,&quot; when words could be of any avail in modifyingour  Russian policy ;  action is necessary now.  With  the exception of  the  &quot;  WTorkers&apos;Dreadnought,&quot; which frankly embraces the Soviet system, and the &quot; Clarion,&quot; &quot; Justice,&quot;and, of course, the &quot; British Citizen,&quot; which unhesitatingly condemn it, most of the Labourpapers sit on the fence in discussing Bolshevism.   Mr.  G. Bernard Shaw contributes tothis week&apos;s &quot; Labour Leader &quot; an article bearing the title &quot; Are we Bolshevists ? &quot;   his main contention may be said to be that Bolshevism, so  far as the term is not used merely as a synonym for Socialism, is a system which (not unjustifiably) despairs of all the existing machinery of democracy and seeks to bring in a social millenium by a mixture of cajoleryand force ; its only difference  from soi-disant democracies the frankness of its methods and the honesty of its aims being distinctly in its  favour.  Proceeding to deal with thequestion of  intervention in Russia, he prophesies that persistence in- it would producenothing short of national schism ; there were no real pro-Germans in; the  last  war- therewill be thousands of pro-Russians in the next.  Mr.  Joseph King (in  the  &quot;  BradfordPioneer &quot;), while  doubtful if the Soviet system would work outside Russia,  is disposed to think it may be fundamentally more democratic than our own system.   To &quot; Forward &quot;the crux of the matter lies in the question of why Lenin has not yet called a  constituentassembly ;  if it is because he fears the voice of the people, then &quot; Forward &quot; is not pre-pared to endorse his system.   But it thirsts for knowledge,  and on this score is  verybitter about the failure of the Labour members to press home, in the debate  after thePremiers statement, the case for a first-hand investigation of Russian conditions.   Dr.Nansen&apos;s scheme for feeding Russia is discussed in one  or two of the papers, but fearsare expressed that the preliminary conditions may be for the Bolshevists to throw down their arms and the Allies to reap by fraud the fruits  of victory.France.     Dr.  F. C.  Conybeare in the &quot; Bradford Pioneer &quot; criticises at some length the Frenchclaims in Morocco,  making reference to the opposition they have aroused in Spain andItaly, and our attempt to propitiate Spain by the  dffer of Gibraltar.necessary for men at. work on the main roads, and in Northumberland the County council was enabled to secure the release of road motor waggons necessary for the  same purpose.At Colburn the intervention of the Divisional Council led to an improvement of the trainservice necessary to  allow of three shifts being worked at the local collieries.  Cases ofimportant industrial developments promoted by these local  bodies  are  naturally lesscommon.  At Oban, however, largely as a result of  the  recommendations of the local employment Committee and the  Divisional Employment Council, arrangements havebeen completed for a 10 years&apos; lease of the Ballachulish slate quarries to the Government,thus re-establishing an important  industry in the neighbourhood.    Finally, mention may be made of the work which has been done  for the disabledsoldier, a problem to which in many areas local bodies have devoted special attention.The Rotherham Employment Committee, for example, recently negotiated an arrange-ment  with a group of employers whereby 119 disabled men were placed in employmentof the total of 196 on the books of the local Employment Exchange.
League of Nations.     In the same article the League of Nations is described as &quot; nothing but a continuation of King Edward&apos;s ring of fire and steel drawn around Germany.&quot;  The growing alienationof Holland, Scandinavia and Switzerland, and the menace of a consolidated Asia undera  Japanese leadership, are  developments, it is asserted, which bid fair to stultify theLeague.^ *    The Secret Treaties, which accompanied the entrance of Italy into the war, and theimbroglio to which  they seem likely to lead, are referred to in  hostile  terms in theWoolwich &quot; Pioneer &quot; and some  other papers.The Blockade.     In &quot; Forward &quot;  it is maintained that the American capitalists and their spokesman,Mr.  Wilson, are ultimately to be blamed for the continuance of the Blockade, which is described as a veritable act of suicide on the part  of Capital.The International.     &quot; Forward &quot;  discusses the question of the rival Internationals of Moscow  and Berne.This division of forces, it says, is disastrous,  and some modus vivendi must be found.  Inthe opinion of &quot; Forward,&quot; there is substance and permanence about Berne before whichthe glamour of Moscow pales.  It looks for  a reorganised International with permanent machinery which  can give a clear leading to Labour on all important questions.India.     Dealing with the present unrest, the &quot; Call &quot; says :  &quot;that  Britain canjpermanentlymaintain dominion in India is impossible.&quot;                                 (B)-Home Affairs. Labour Policy.     Accounts of the various Easter Conferences e.g., of the I.L.P. at Huddersfield and B.S.P. at Sheffield, the Clarion Club, etc. occupy the bulk of the Labour Press this week. The &quot; Call &quot; says that at the  B.S.P. Conference, a programme immediately applicable to the industrial and political situation was for the first time enunciated.   The &quot; Clarion &quot; is contemptuous of its deliberations which is hardly to be wondered at in view of the distinct sympathies which were expressed with Sovietism.  Even the I.L.P. Conference refused definitely to condemn the Bolsheviks a  fact which the  &quot; Labour Leader &quot; attributes rather to disgust with the widespread misrepresentations of  Bolshevism than to approval of the Soviet form of Government.   In the Sheffield Conference the &quot; Leader &quot; finds evidence that the I.L.P. is &quot; the most active and alert political organisation in the country.&quot;   The &quot; Clarion &quot; discusses the old vicious scale of wages and prices, and lays down the principle that  no permanent progress can  be made till wages are fixed by the cost of living, and a more generous policy by  the bigger unions makes it possible for in- dustrial progress to be general and  not sectional.   &quot; The Call&quot; pleads  for a centralised Labour organisation to act as a &quot; shadow Government &quot; controlling the Labour move- ment,  and by constant preparation fitting itself for  the psychological moment when it can seize the reality of power,  and mould the fluid forces of society.     The Glasgow Strike Trials are  commented on by several of  the papers. The general impression is that a class-prejudiced jury openly flouted the summing up of a fair-minded judge, whose attitude in the opinion of &quot; Forward &quot; had &quot; done  much to rehabilitate the waning trust of the working class in the impartiality of the Law Courts.&quot;  The finding of the  jury, says the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot;  constitutes a  challenge to the whole Labour movement; and it adds that a public enquiry into the circumstances leading to the arrests should be held forthwith.Housing.    In the &quot; Clarion &quot; appears an article by the President of the Banking Reform League,.advocating the application to the Housing Problem the principle of the so-called &quot; GuernseyMarket Scheme,&quot; by which a public loan, free  of interest, was raised by the simple expe-dient of a paper currency, backed by the estimated value of the buildings, and withdrawnfrom circulation when building operations were complete.    (C 1762)                                                               B 2
Restoration of Trade Union Conditions.     Strangely enough, the Bill dealing with this matter receives but scant attention inthe  Labour  Press  this week.  The only noteworthy  comment is  in  the pages of  the&quot; Cotton Factory Times,&quot; where  reference is made to a Press interview with Mr. RobertYoung, M.P.  (of the Amalgamated Society of Engineers), in which  he condemns the bill as too half-hearted in its penalties and too qualified in the redemption of a distinct Govern-ment pledge. Pre-war conditions should have been restored in toto as a  basis,  and any modification left to the intitiative of the parties concerned.Cotton Trade.     The same journal points out how the Cotton Trade is losing its workers  at a rapid rate,and prophesies  that this drain will continue until  working conditions are  made  more attractive.                (2) The Daily Press on Demobilisation and Resettlement.Brick-making.     The &quot; Daily Express &quot; (23rd  April)  reports that the small brickyards could absorb20,000 men, but lie derelict for want of capital.     &quot; The Government will not advance any money, and apparently are better  satisfied        to pay  millions  in unemployment doles than  to enable brick-makers to absorb        a large  proportion of the unemployed.&quot;Ex-Service Men&apos;s Demonstration (Liverpool).     The &quot; Daily News &quot; 24th April) reports that over  5,000 discharged and demobilisedsoldiers and sailors held a demonstration  at Liverpool  on the 23rd  April, at whicha resolution was passed calling on the civic authorities and private employers to take stepsto provide employment.   A deputation which was received by the Deputy Lord Mayorcomplained that women were still occupying men&apos;s positions, and that coloured men werebeing similarly retained.   It suggested that public works should be  put in hand  at once.Housing Demonstration (glasgow).     The &quot; Manchester Guardian  &quot;  (23rd April) reports that a  demonstration againstdelay in housing and unemployment was held at Glasgow  on the 22nd April, under the auspices of  the  Glasgow Labour Party  Housing  Association.  Resolutions were passedprotesting against the alleged Government delay in dealing  with housing, and demandingthe immediate erection of cottages  for which the Government  should commandeer  all necessary materials.Farmers and Military Labour.    The &quot; Daily Express &quot; (28th  April)  reports that  the  National Union of Farmersis protesting  against the War Office decision to call up members of agricultural companieson the grounds that it is a &quot; great calamity to agriculture and detrimental to the national interest.&quot;   The Union is pressing Lord Ernie to appeal for at least a portion of the pivotalmen.                                     PART IV.                                    (1)  General.Bakers.    A preliminary meeting of the committee of inquiry into conditions of night-bakingwas held at Montagu House on the 24th April under the presidency of Sir W. MacKenzie.The first public sitting will be held on May 1st.Actors.    At a meeting of the Actors&apos; Association held in His Majesty&apos;s Theatre on the 27thApril, it was announced that  the dispute with the West End managers had been broughtto a successful termination, the following being among the terms secured by the actors :     (a) A minimum wage of  3 per week of eight or nine performances, with arrangements           for extra payment for additional work.    (6) The establishment of  pay-rates for rehearsals, with double rates for Sundays.    (c) Illness not to be a cause for dismissal, unless it causes more than fourteen days&apos;           absence in three months.
    Efforts are being made to induce Mr. C. B. Cochran to withdraw his boycott of theAssociation;  if these efforts are unavailing, members of the Association  are to refuse to sign contracts to appear in any play under his management after the 1st  June  unless thecast consists exclusively of members  of the  Actors&apos;  Association.  Further  provisionsinclude the raising of a Protection Fund, towards which  600 have already been collected,and the formation of  an Employment  Agency, which  is to be the recognised means of entry into the profession.Railwaymen.    The conference of the National Union of Railwaymen,  the  Amalgamated society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen, and the  Railway Executive was resumed at theBoard of Trade on the 24th April.  The  negotiations deal with the standardisation of wages,and although necessarily protracted, they  are reported to be proceeding  satisfactorily.Negotiations are also in progress between the Crafts Union Executive and the  executive of the National Union  of Railwaymen with  regard to the position of shopmen, whose ex-elusion  from the recent settlement  between the N.U.R. and  the Railway  Executive is causing discontent in several districts.    On the 28th April  the Railway Clerks&apos; Association resumed negotiations with the Rail-way Executive.   Discussions were reported to  be amicable, and a settlement is hoped for in the course of a few days.  The recognition of the Railway Clerks Association (whichhas a membership of about 70,000) by the Railway Executive  is only of recent date.  its main demands at present are :     (a) Minimum wage rate varying from  70 for boys under  sixteen to   230 for men of           twenty-eight and upwards, with  an additional bonus of  20 for those resident           in London.    (b) A classification of positions according to their  degree  of responsibility by a joint.           committee  of the staff and the railway  authorities, with a view to settling           distinctions of salary.    (c) A maximum week of 38 hours for day duty, and 34 hours for night duty, the latter           to include all periods of duty between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m.    (d) Various questions  of  promotion, overtime, extra pay for Sundays  and Bank           Holidays, annual holidays,  sick pay, the  re-absorption of demobilised men           and the payment to them of a  lump-sum  bonus.    (e) Recommendations for the nationalisation of railways  and  canals.The Coal Industry Commission.    The Commission held public sittings on the 24th, 25th and 29th  April.  The viewson nationalisation of  various  economists including Mr.   Harold    Cox,   ProfessorEdwin Cannan, Professor G. H. Scott,  Mr. J. A. Hobson, Mr.  Sidney Webb, Mr. GrahamWallas and  Mr.  J. H. Jones have bsen  heard.  An application by Mr. Leslie Scott,K.C., M.P., for permission to be heard on behalf of two-thirds of the  royalty owners ofthe United Kingdom was refused.  Mr.  Robert Smillie has applied for the appearancebefore the  Commission as witnesses  of the following mine-owners the Duke of Northum-berland, the  Duke of Hamilton (by  agent), Lord Durham, Lord Dynevor, Lord Tredegar,Lord Bute, Lord Dunraven and Captain Wemyss.    It is  announced that the Commission^ Interim Report  on Nationalisation will be presented by the 20th June and not the 20th May as  was originally intended.    The Leeds Chamber of Commerce passed a resolution on the 29th April condemningthe Commission as not fairly qualified to report on the future  management of mines, and maintaining that it should have contained a majority of traders and consumers.Textile Trades.     A conference between employers and workpeople  on the  question of hours was heldon the 24th April.  No conclusion was reached, and  the conference was  adjourned till the 5th May.   By agreement between employers and operatives arrangements havebeen made for the spinning mills engaged on American cotton, which have been idle sincethe 14th April, to be re-opened on the  28th.  The Amalgamated Association of Card andBlowing-Room Operatives held its annual meeting in  Manchester on the 26th April.  Itwas decided that the Association should be represented at the United Conference of textileworkers in Preston.   This conference,  convened by the Scottish  Federation of TextileTrade Unions with a view to promoting unity of action with  regard to hours, wages andconditions throughout the industry, was held on the 29th April.  A sub-committee of 15,
    *  Various branches  of the National Agricultural  Labourers&apos; and  Eural Workers&apos;  Union are pressing the Executive to demand a 44-hour week and a minimum wage of 50s.

RESOLUTIONS WERE PASSED OPPOSING THE INTRODUCTION INTO SCHOOLS OF MILITARY DRILL AND OTHER  FORMS OF MILITARY TRAINING, REGRETTING DELAYS IN THE DEMOBILISATION OF TEACHERS AND ENDORSING  THE PRINCIPLE OF EQUAL PAY FOR MEN AND WOMEN.  A RIVAL ORGANISATION, THE  NATIONAL Union  OF UNCERTIFICATED  TEACHERS, OPENED  A  CONFERENCE  AT SOUTHPORT ON THE 25TH UNDER THE &quot; PRESIDENCY OF MR. JOHN BATTLE.   HOSTILITY TO THE NATIONAL UNION OF TEACHERS WAS EXPRESSED,  AND IT WAS DECIDED TO CHANGE THE NAME OF THE UNION TO &quot; NATIONAL UNION OF CLASS TEACHERS,&quot;&quot;  AND TO APPOINT AN ORGANISER.   STRIKES OF ELEMENTARY SCHOOL TEACHERS AGAINST THE PROPOSED  SCALES OF SALARIES ARE  THREATENED IN HUDDERSFIELD, SUNDERLAND AND WREXHAM.  Dockers.       For  LIVERPOOL STRIKE  SEE PART V.       On THE 25th APRIL TWO SECTIONAL STRIKES AGAINST CERTAIN REGULATIONS OF THE SHIPBUILDING  EMPLOYERS&apos; FEDERATION BROKE  OUT  AT  SOUTHAMPTON, INVOLVING  THE  RIGGERS ENGAGED IN  REMOVING VESSELS FROM ONE BERTH TO ANOTHER AND THE BOILER SEALERS.

RAILWAY COMPANIES, WHICH WAS HELD IN CAMDEN TOWN  ON THE 29TH APRIL, DISSATISFACTION WAS EXPRESSED WITH CONDITIONS OF WORK  AND PAY OF THE  RAILWAY  POLICE FOR GREAT BRITAIN AND  IRELAND, AND AN ENQUIRY WAS  DEMANDED.  Shipbuilding.      The FEDERATION OF ENGINEERING AND SHIPBUILDING TRADES AT SHEFFIELD  HAS DECIDED TO-  RECOMMEND THE RANK AND file TO VOTE FOR A 48-HOUR WEEK IN THE BALLOT TO BE HELD ON THE  20TH May.   A CONFERENCE OF THE FEDERATION TO BE HELD IN CARDIFF NEXT WEEK WILL BE ASKED  to CONSIDER THE PROPOSAL FOR TAKING OVER THE CHEPSTOW NATIONAL SHIPBUILDING YARD. THERE  IS A PROPOSAL AFOOT FOR THE AMALGAMATION OF THE SOCIETIES OF THE BOILER-MAKERS, SHIPWRIGHTS  AND SHIPCONSTRUCTORS, AND  BLACKSMITHS.  SUCH an  AMALGAMATION WOULD RESULT IN a SHIP-  YARD TRIPLE ALLIANCE WITH A MEMBERSHIP of ABOUT 170,000.   THE QUESTION IS BEING BALLOTTED  on.
Middle Class Union.     The Middle Class Union  reports a steady increase in membership.   It has decidedto send representatives to place its views on the income tax before the Royal Commission,and to ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Home Secretary  and the Minister ofLabour to stop the abuse in the out-of-work donation.Peopled League.     An organisation  bearing this title and describing itself as &quot; A union of the masses of the nation,  as citizens, consumers and tax-payers, formed for  the purpose  of takingimmediate action on  definite lines,&quot; is being formed under the presidency of Mr. HoratioBottomley, M.P.  Its policy will  be defined at  a meeting at the Albert Hall on the 10thMay.May Day.                            &apos;  .     Reports have been received from various parts of the country indicating the intentionof various labour organisations to celebrate the 1st May by a cessation  from work.   InCork a thousand railwaymen have resolved to take this course in direct opposition to theinstructions of the N.U!R.Education and  Training.     Mr. Seebohm  Rowntree has inaugurated a scheme for the establishment of LectureSchools in Yorkshire  for  Foremen, Forewomen, Works Managers  and Factory Admini-strators.  The  prospectus  is to include general,  social  and industrial  problems.  Oneschool is to meet at Scarborough.&apos;  The Committees have been formed with a view  to settingup similar schools elsewhere.  The Y.W.C.A. is developing a scheme to house and traindomestic workers, whose services will be offered at lOd. per hour for a week not exceeding48 hours.   The Training Department of the Ministry of Labour has put into operationarrangements for the  vocational and domestic training of unemployed women in normalwomen&apos;s  occupations including  domestic  service in * which  there is a  reasonable prospect of employment.   The average length of  training will  be about three months,and  the courses will be designed to meet the case of those  who have lost their skill or been deprived of the opportunity for gaining requisite knowledge and practice.  Maintenancegrants will be given  to trainees.Restoration of Trade  Union Conditions.     Mr. J. Beard, of the National  Federation of General Workers, presided (in the absenceof Mr. Clynes) at a conference, held in private on the 25th April, to consider this matter.The  proposals drafted by the Joint Committee of the  Engineering Trade  were considered in detail, and it was decided to ask for a conference with the National Federation of  Engi-engineering and Shipbuilding  Trades  to consider the  whole question.  The  matter will alsocome under the discussion of a Trade Union Committee next week, and it is anticipatedthat the Labour Party will put up a stiff fight to secure amendments in the Bill introduced by the Minister of Labour.South Wales.     Two large Labour demonstrations Avere held at Merthyr on the 27th April, to inauguratea campaign for a Keir Hardie Memorial.  Messrs. Lansbury, Noah Ablett and J.  Winstonewere among the speakers.Trade Union Congress.     The Scottish Trade Union Congress held a Conference on the  24th April, to discussthe  Report of  the  Parliamentary Committee.  A  strong protest was forwarded to  theGovernment about the situation in Limerick, and a public inquiry into the attack by thepolice in Glasgow was demanded.Trade Boards.     A Conference with regard  to Trade Boards in the  Distributive Trades was held on the24th April.  The Governments suggested scheme is to be submitted to each association,and  replies sent within three weeks.   Miss Talbot, the President of  the  National Amal-gamated Union of Shop Assistants, states that the Union is trying to get one Board for thewhole trade, instead of a  number, as the employers suggest.t
     Lace Finishing.         An Order  has  been made, dated  the  29th April,  confirming the variation of             certain General Minimum Piece Rates by the Lace Finishing Trade Board.     Tobacco Trade.         Regulations  have  been made  and the  Trade  Board  established.  The  first             meeting of the Board was held on the 29th April.     Special Orders have  been made applying the Trade Boards Acts to :          (1) The Boot and Shoe Repairing Trade.         (2) The Paper  Bag Trade. Joint Industrial Councils.     Boot and Shoe Manufacture. The Drafting Committee has agreed to the Draft Consti- tution, with the exception of the clause providing for the consideration of wages and hours. These matters having been dealt with for the past 25 years by Joint Committees, that arrangement  is  to remain in force.   The Draft Constitution will be considered by the executive of the National Union of Boot and Shoe Operatives on the 28th April.  The Minister will be present  at the first meeting of the Council, which will be held at Montagu House on the 27th May.     Flour Milling. The  first  meeting  of the Joint Industrial Council is  still delayed, owing to the failure of the Employers&apos; Federation and the Co-operative Wholesale Society to settle their representation.     Electric Supply. The first meeting of the Joint Industrial  Council will be held on. the 1st May.   The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Labour will preside during the early part of the proceedings.     Gasworks. The Full Trade Conference held at Montagu House  on  the 15th April agreed to certain amendments  to the  Draft  Constitution as originally prepared and sub- mitted to the constituent Associations.  It was decided that the Constitution as amended should be re-submitted  to the Associations concerned.   The first meeting of the Council was held at Montagu House on  the 30th  April.     Local  Authorities&apos; Non-trading Services. A meeting of the Executive  Committee was held at the Ministry of Labour on the 14th April.  It was decided to circularise all local authorities in  England and Wales  to the effect that a Joint Industrial Council had been formed, and would proceed for  the present on national lines, pending subsequent proposals for  the  formation  of Regional and District Councils.  The Executive  Com- mittee and the Joint  Industrial Council will both  meet on the  9th May.     Brewing. A report  on the application of the Whitley Report to the Brewing Industry has been prepared by a special Sub-committee  of  the Brewers&apos; Society.  The Sub-com- mittee  recommends  the  formation of Works Committees and District Councils, but does not consider a National Joint Industrial Council possible at the present juncture.  Inquiriesare being made into the  prospects of forming a Joint Industrial Council.                                  (2) District Reports. London and South-Eastern.     Unemployment  and  Public  Works. Unemployment is described as serious in the Metropolitan area and in Brighton.  It  is suggested  that pressure  should be applied to the London  County Council, the Metropolitan Water Board, and the Port of London Authority to induce them to set an example in the matter of public works.     The  Gravesend Employment Committee is urging  the  construction  of  a tunnel between Gravesend  to Tilbury  which  will  enable  workers at Gravesend to proceed to Tilbury independent  of fog weather  on the river, and would also  relieve the  traffic congestion  in  London by providing  through  communication  between  the  North and Midlands and Kent and the Continent via the Channel Tunnel.  Enfield is pressing for local railway bridge construction.   Sheerness is finding difficulty in placing women discharged from the docks ;  and over the whole Thames area there is no demand for semi- skilled and unskilled factory hands, a class not much relieved by public works.   The Divi- sional Employment Council is urging the formation  of a Trade Board or Industrial Council for the catering trade in view of the working conditions and long hours.     Industrial Unrest. Unrest  among municipal employees seems to be spreading.  The City of London Corporation is negotiating  with the  Municipal Employees Association over the wages and hours of street cleaners. The Chiswick Urban District Council and
 Stepney  Borough Council are  also involved with  their employees.  In  Stepney the National Union of Corporation and General Workers is demanding a 30s.  bonus and a 47-hour week, and is threatening a strike.     Woolwich  Arsenal is&apos;disturbed by a  demarcation dispute;  the organised joiners and carpenters object to the employment as dilutees of labourers belonging to the Workers&apos; Union.  The  Electrical  Trades Union and  the Contractors&apos; Federation are reported (26th April, 1919) to be submitting their difficulties  jointly  to the Ministry of Labour. A national conference on the unemployment of women and the position of skilled men in  the aircraft industry is being called by  the men&apos;s  union.   Important  negotiations on grading between  the  London  master builders and  the  painters are  being watched carefully by the whole building trade, and the situation may develop seriously. South Midlands and Eastern,     Unemployment. Unemployment is considered serious  at  Reading and Ipswich,  is increasing at Bedford, Colchester, Yarmouth,  Leicester, Northampton and Norwich, and is decreasing at Cambridge, Lowestoft,  Grays, St. Albans, Wellingborough.     Housing schemes are expected to provide work at Northampton.  Training  schemes in  boot and shoe making  are in hand  at Norwich and Kettering ; and the authorities at Great Yarmouth hope that harbour repairs will be started  by means of a loan from the Local Government Board.  At  Peterborough there is a demand for brick  workers, but the full development of the  industry is arrested by the shortage of railway wagons.   The evacuation of part of a Reading factory by the Royal Army Service Corps and its return to  peace-time  production are expected  to provide  occupation  for some hundreds of workers. South Western.     Unemployment. Bristol  is finding difficulty in employing its ex-service men, who have interviewed the Mayor to urge relief  work and the dismissal of women war workers, especially on the trams.   A report has been prepared on the effect of the cancellation of Admiralty contracts on the labour situation of Southampton and Cowes,  and efforts are being made to absorb discharged workers from Cowes who are not natives  of the Isle of Wight in the Bristol  Channel repairing works.   Investigations are being conducted into the prospects of the Gloucester ferro-concrete shipbuilding industry.     The Industrial Situation. The labour situation is quiet.   Bristol tramway workers are demanding new rates of pay for the reduced working week.   Cowes Urban District pro- poses a  45-hour week in  winter, and  a 50-hour week  in summer  for its roadmen and scavengers and has  conceded  a  47-hour  week to  its  gas  workers.    The  48-hour week seems to have been adopted voluntarily in the clay industry at Bridgwater.  The organisation  of farmers and farm labourers is making rapid  strides in  Somerset,  and, while the farmers have accepted recent increases in wages as reasonable, they are opposed to  the  demands  for hours and holidays put forward by the agricultural section of the Workers&apos; Union. West Midlands.     Unemployment. The problem is  most  acute at   Cradley Heath, Smethwick, and Oldbury, but the situation is improving.  The chief difficulty in the engineering trade (such as chainmaking) is the shortage of pig-iron and iron bars, due to the disinclination of iron- masters to accept forward orders with  the prospect of a rise in price.  The lock and latch trade at Willenhall has revived ; the export of carpets from Kidderminster is increasing, and the jewellery trade  of  the Birmingham area is asking for men, and is willing to co-operate in a scheme for the training of suitable unskilled workers.  Birmingham is to provide employment in the construction of a new water pipe-line  from Wales, which is expected to be completed in 1921.     Other minor questions are the repatriation of Chinese munition workers in Birmingham, and the release of pivotal steel moulders from the army. Yorks and East Midlands.     Unemployment and Public Works. Unemployment  is general in the  lace centres of Long Eaton,  Ilkeston, and Nottingham, and it is reported that it will increase if foreign imports continue to break up the home market and if the French Industrial Commission is allowed to continue its extensive purchases of lace-machinery.  Investigations into thelace-making industry are proceeding.
     Industrial Situation. The industrial position is  described as normal.  In the iron trade, Bradford moulders are carrying on a campaign for the &quot; closed shop &quot; ;  Lincoln moulders refuse to work overtime.  A Building Trades Council is proposed for the Midland area not served by the Yorkshire Joint Industrial Council;  its centre will be Birmingham and it will include Lincoln where there  is considerable unrest.  The Garment Workers&apos; Union in the West Riding has put forward a detailed programme a 44-hour week, over- time maximum to be six hours a week and 30 weeks a year and to be paid for at double rates after the first two hours,  uniform methods, of  production, abolition of fines,  healthier conditions and holidays, shop committees and a minimum wage of 26-. Id. per hour.  The Chief Constable of the West Riding has proposed  an 8-hour day for the police force. North-Western. .     Unemployment. Unemployment is  becoming  less&apos; serious  at  Preston, Stoekport,.. Oldham and Rossendale, but the general situation  of  the  cotton  trade is still unsettled. The Master Cotton Spinners are now arguing that  any sudden or serious move towards reduced hours, nationally  or internationally, would  lead  to stagnation in the cotton industry of France and  England.   The situation, however,  is  expected  to  improve in consequence of the modification of the embargoes.  Negotiations on hours continue ; the employers have offered a 48-hour week  with reduced  wages.  Depression in the cotton trade is affecting  the cotton waste trade,  the workers in which are  endeavouring to secure advances in wages and threatening to strike.   The employers are indifferent, as the labour is of the lowest type and the supply is abundant.     Unemployment  of ex-service men is increasing, and  bitterness  has been caused by reports that employers have attempted to take on ex-service men  at  pre-war rates.  The release  of pivotal plate-moulders from the  Army  is strongly urged  as a means of providing  employment for  others  in the  engineering  trade.   At St.  Helens serious unemployment is anticipated,  as  its  foreign markets for chemicals  are more than threatened by American or Japanese competition.  A recommendation has been put forward to include fustian,  making at Northwich among  the trades scheduled under the Trade Boards Act.     Industrial Unrest. Engineering  is  quieter  as the   surplus  of  labour  restrains agitation by those in  employment.   Reports  are to hand that the  shortened week has not been accompanied in this district by a corresponding rise in efficiency to maintain output.   The question of  dilutee and female labour is again acute and certain firms on meter work and  small electrical parts and ball bearings allege that they will have to shut down if they must dismiss their women workers.  An agricultural machinery employer reports strong American competition.  At Barrow the agitation for a 44-hour  week is again reviving.    Merseyside dockers are unsettled, one report attributing the  discontent to the Irish element.  The point at issue is the detailed working of the 44-hour week ;  the hour for beginning work is in dispute and the  shifts evidently make it difficult for the men to get drinks at their accustomed time.    Negotiations  on behalf of  municipal employees are being conducted  by the trade unions concerned with  the Lancashire and Cheshire local authorities. Northern.    Unemployment. Unemployment is rising slightly in the iron and steel areas of Tees-side and the  Cumberland ports,  but the  Tyne district  seems to be returning successfully to normal  activity.  Shipbuilding  and turbine  construction are reviving, and orders have been received for locomotives for Scottish, Welsh  and Indian railways.   The Divisional Staff has carried out investigations on the work  proposed by public aut  orities at North Shields, on the chemical, oil-refining and  leather  industries on Tyneside, timber at Blyth, public works at Darlington, and iron and steel works at Workington.  The housing problem is acute, particularly in Cleveland  and in Newcastle where the  Garden Cities and Town Planning Association is active.    Industrial Situation.-Th.e  agitation for  a 44-hour week  continues.   Ballot  papers have been issued to members of skilled unions in the engineering and shipbuilding trades on Tees-side, where overtime has ceased.   Any union with a majority vote against the pro-posal may stand out.  Bricklayers and bricklayers&apos; labourers employed on Tees-side and inthe Hartlepools are also refusing to work overtime, and the 44-hour week  is also an acuteissue in the foundries  at Darlington.  The building trade seems inclined to accept the:44-hour week.    Demarcation  disputes are taking place in the yards on the Tyne and at Sunderland.There is evidence  of an agitation against conscription.
                                PART V.-DISPUTES.* (a) Involving a Stoppage of Work.            The majority of workers in Limerick returned to work on the 25th April.  The commandant        of the local military area has agreed to modify the permit system, so as to allow employers to        issue permits and to allow workers to pass out of the town without delay at meal-times and        while proceeding to and from their work.            The  Liverpool dockers, who struck against certain clauses of &quot;the new dockers&apos; charter,        returned to work on the 25th and 26th April.  A meeting of the National Executive of the        Dockers&apos; Union was held at Liverpool, and the men&apos;s grievances  were placed before it. The        men. were induced to resume work when the decisions of this meeting were placed before them. Wales.     Unemployment is most acute in Carnarvon, where the demand for slates is insufficient, among the Flint miners and in Cardiff, Swansea and Newport, where, however, men are returning to work in the ship-repairing yards, now that the boilermakers&apos; strike has been settled.  Generally speaking, employment in South Wales depends on the supply of raw material for  steel-works and a sufficiency of orders  for the dependent  industries.  The Ebbw Vale Steel Works, which closed down owing to shortage of iron ore and the limited supply of wagons, are expected to  re-start about the beginning  of May.  The condition of the iron trade has recently been badly affected by a lock-out of general cargo workers at Swansea which  held up  shipping and  pig-iron supplies.  Arising out of this Swansea disturbance between the Swansea Harbour Trust and the master stevedores and the general cargo workers, the Court of Referees decided that a talleyman who claimed unemployment donation was not entitled to it, since he was unemployed as the result of a trade dispute.     Industrial Situation. The tin-plate industry is disturbed.   The annealers, who are the  link between the mills  and the tin-houses, have  given in notices to terminate work on 3rd May.   Their position is taken up in defiance of their own unions  and the recently formed Industrial  Council.  American competition  is making  the  proposed combined selling agency a reality.  The central selling office is to be tried for five  years, prices will be fixed at monthly meetings and  over-production is to be fined.  Generally, there is a recrudescence of the  demand for the socialisation of industry, and the  foreign policy of the  Government towards Russia and Hungary is being  severely criticised  in advanced labour circles. Scotland.     Unemployment. Unemployment  is  highest in  Glasgow, Lanarkshire,  Paisley, Falkirk,  Dundee,  Aberdeen,   and   the  smaller  jute   and  linen towns.   As  the unemployed  in  these  towns are mostly women, domestic service  and  training  schemes occupy much  of the attention of the  Women&apos;s Sub-Committee of the Employment Council.  The jute industry in Dundee may revive,  since the employers have rescinded the  prices agreement of the 20th February, and there has been a corresponding rise in demand from South  America, especially since Dundee prices are now below those of Calcutta, where the market is described as &quot; rampant.&quot;  Dundee, however,  relies mainly on the English market, and  any improvement due  to subsidiary markets is likely to  . prove of minor importance.     The Employment Council received a  deputation  on the 14th April from the Corpora- tions of Edinburgh and Glasgow,  and the Convention of Royal Burghs to discuss the&quot;proposed Mid-Scotland ship-canal.  The  officials of  the  Department have  been instru- mental in putting Dundee  building committee in touch with firms  able and willing to supply bricks, and have assisted Tarriff Town Council to keep open the quarries in the district as a  source of building material supply.                                             i The Industrial Situation.     The  result  of the Glasgow  strike   trials  has  been  received  with  indifference, except among the extremists.   The Scottish Trades  Union Congress, whch met at Perth (25th April, 1919) was mainly concerned with shorter hours.     Edinburgh gas  workers are threatening a  strike  unless  a  44 48-hour  week  is conceded.  The  City  Council  of Glasgow has been  approached by the Municipal Em- ployers&apos; Association to establish a  Whitley Council of a  purely local character for their public services.
            The 2,000 officials and men who were  on strike at the Britannia P.D. Collieries, South        Wales, owing to the dismissal of a mechanic, returned to work on the 26th April, on the under-        standing that the subject of the dispute should be inquired into.            Several thousand miners in South Staffordshire struck on the 28th April because the coal-        owners had failed to pay the arrears due to them under the Sankey Award.            The strike of the Huddersfield tailors continues.(6) Not Involving a Stoppage of Work            The summer prices fixed for milk are  causing dissatisfaction among the farmers in Lanca-        shire, in the  Birmingham district,  and in the West of England.  In this  latter  district the        farmers are protesting against the differential treatment under the Milk Prices Order, whereby        they are allowed 2d. less per gallon  than in other areas.  There is a general  threat on the part        of the milk farmers in these three districts that they will reduce their herds or turn the milk        into butter.                                                                     ,            The South Wales tinplate annealers who threatened to strike on Wednesday, April 30th.        passed a resolution  in favour of withdrawing  strike notices on  condition that the men were        paid, within one week, the extra sum of Is.  fid. per 100 boxes as from March 1st.            A strike of Liverpool builders is threatened on the 1st May, when their notices to cease        work expire.            A national strike of 9,000 members of the Amalgamated Union of Co-operative and Com-        mercial  Employees and Allied Workers appears to be threatened if the Co-operative Union        tries to insist on the workers in Co-operative  Societies joining craft unions.  The Central        Board of the Co-operative Union recently passed a resolution advising all co-operative societies        to press their workers to become members of the trade unions covering their various depart-        ments.            With reference  to the  threatened  strike  of  the  City of  London  street cleaners,  the        dispute  has been settled, the workers accepting the proposal of the Corporation  that wages        should be raised 20 per cent, and a  war  bonus be granted.
