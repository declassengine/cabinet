This  document is the property of His  Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.    200SECRET.                                          0154                                          4617WAR CABINET.RELAXATION  OF  THE BLOCKADE  OF  GERMANY.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY  OF  STATE FOR  WAR.  I circulate for the consideration of my colleagues a Note by the General Staff.                                              WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.25th April, 1919.    1. The  original reasons for  the continuation of  the  blockade after the  signing of the  Armistice were  summarized  by Marshal  Foch  on 3rd  February,  1919,  asfollows :              &quot; The  strict  maintenance of the rules of  the blockade are necessary from         the military point of view.  Actually, when the Allied Armies are reduced to         a  point when it would  be difficult to carry  out  any big military operations         the blockade, which can be tightened or relaxed according to circumstances,         will remain the best and  most rapid means of enforcing the  terms of the         Armistice and of enforcing our will on Germany.&quot;    So  long as the chief danger to the Allies lay in the immobilization of the GermanNational Army for purely German National objects, the General Staff were in agreementwith the above view.  This, however, is no longer the case.    2. At the present time  the  national spirit of Germany appears to be completelycrushed and the existing Government is extremely unlikely to attempt  to contest the will of the  Allies by force of arms.   The maintenance of this Government  is conse-quently a primary interest to the Allies, but its  position  is weak, and  unless it canalleviate the terrible  conditions  existing in  a large portion  of  Germany, its fall ispractically certain.   This would be disastrous  from every point of view,  since it wouldbe succeeded by a  Government, or absence  of Government, which not only would be incapable of carrying out the Allied terms, but which in all  probability would have notthe slightest desire  to do  so.  By  precipitating the fall of the present government we should  throw Germany  into  the arms of the  Bolsheviks  and so give the SovietGovernment  of Russia a fresh lease of life.    The  days of the latter  appear to benumbered and the  only  thing which can save it is the exploitation of fresh  territory.Thus, although the  ultimate effect on Germany might be  disastrous (which would no-doubt suit   the  French),  the  immediate effect would almost certainly be to  saveBolshevism  and so lead to  the recrudescence of the war on a large scale.  To this theFrench  might not be averse, as with their characteristic  disregard of  realities, theythink it would give them a chance of further crushing  Germany whilst British and american troops are  still available.   Actually the  Allied troops available  are  quite inadequate  for the purpose and such a contingency cannot be. regarded with favour bythe Allies in question,  even from the point of view of the immediate future.    3. Looking  still further ahead, it would directly assist the exploitation of russia by German)^ and the conclusion of an alliance between those two Powers, which presentsthe greatest menace to the future peace of the world, and which it is the main objectof His  Majesty&apos;s Government to prevent.  It must be recognized, therefore, that any    (B19/210) 70 4/19  H&amp;S  7081wo
small advantages to be gained from the French point of view by a continuation  of theblockade in its present form are infinitesimal  compared with  the  danger  of  assistingGermany to go Bolshevik and so precipitating  a general conflagration in Europe.     4. It may be added  that the  partial  raising of the blockade  does not necessarilyprevent  its  re-imposition in a  modified form  at any future date.   Once the german economic machine has commenced to function, the threat of even a partial restrictionwould be greater  than  a  more  efficient blockade  at the present  time, when themachinery is completely stopped and when the population is on the verge of despair.     5. For  the  above reasons, the General  Staff are strongly  of opinion that no time should be lost in relaxing the present restrictions, not only with the object of improvingthfe present  deplorable conditions  existing in  Germany, but also to give to the Germanpeople some hope for the future, which alone  can  enable  the more  stable  elements  tomake head against Bolshevism.
