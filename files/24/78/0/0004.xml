1This  document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government:&apos;T&quot;1 (*01544605WHAT  CAN  GERMANY SAVE  FROM THE WRECK?GErtMANTS ONLY HOPE IS  TO COMBINE WITH ENGLAND.    The following translation of a German pamphlet may be of interest to my colleagues.The writer is a German gentleman of education, position and  means, and is  personallywell known to an officer of the Military Intelligence Department, who describes him as aman of the utmost integrity and a clear and original thinker.    His argument, to put it  as briefly as possible, is that  Germany is lost beyond hopeof recovery except by means of help from outside, and the best remedy is that she should become  an  autonomous  British Colony.   He admits in a postscript dated  early inFebruary that  his suggestion did not meet with much acceptance among those to whosenotice it had come in the two previous months.    Needless to say, the  pamphlet is  ordy  circulated as illustrating a curious andinteresting point of view.                                                 WINSTON S. CHUECHILL.  12th April, 1919.                                                           I st December, 1918.     The voices which declare openly that Germany is on  the edge  cf the abyss are increasing  in a most  satisfactory manner,  but, as a man  who has spent 40 years inforeign countries, I consider even this to be a delusion.  . In reality Germany had alreadyfallen headlong into the abyss before the Armistice was signed, and every bone in herbody was broken--now she is delirious.  The patient  talks,  as  is  usually the  case, ofthings which occupied her attention shortly before the accident.  First of all, we gleanedprotests against the inhumanity of the condition (as if the Entente  had ever thought orsaid that  they had any intention  of  making  humane  conditions)-then we heardwhimpering about hunger-then a groan in consequence of severe pain then followedfeverish fancies about the political programmes of the various parties,  about the  8-hourday, increased  wages, separation of Church and State and so forth in short, absolutedelirium.  That is the hopeless condition of our dear patient.                         WE NEED A MAN, A  LEADER !     And since Germany has not produced a leader and is not capable of doing so, the patient twitching in convulsions is also incapable of climbing out of the stony abyss  into which she has plunged, in order to place herself in the surgeon s hands, for the purposeof having her limbs restored, and made useful once  more.     The salient point  is her incapability of doing so.     For the important question, on which  everything turns, is this.:      &quot; Is Germany  capable of rising  by her own  unaided efforts  and beginning  lifeanew ? &quot;  My proposal has no point,- unless prominent men in  politics, trade and industry are also of the  opinion that Germany might certainly rise up with only one broken limb,but that it  is an impossibility where every limb in the body is broken.  We shall haveto pay colossal indemnities, apart from our own  war costs.   Instead  of  industry  andtrade being in  a  position  to  supply the money required, influences we might almostsay  demoniacal influences-have  combined to prevent every possibility of the kind.Our iron industry suffers terribly from the loss of the mines in Lorraine and Luxemburg.(B19/180)  70 4/19 H&amp;S  7046 wo
 Industries which  depend upon foreign  countries are, firstly, hampered by the rate  of exchange, and, secondly, prevented from buying raw materials  by the trusts.   Even the  small  compensating value  WH possess in potash is diminished by the loss of the potash works in Alsace.  In the east  we are threatened with the loss of a great part of Silesia and Saxony, with valuable coal and ore  mines.   To  complete the catastrophe, the Revolutionaries by their incitements are  creating  a  positive  reluctance to work. Apart; from tuis, hundreds of thousands of workers, whose hands have lost their cunning during the war, cannot be considered  as folly competent, even if they desired to work  which they do not.      It is obvious that a return to  pre-war wages, combined  with increased  working hours, cannot  be  imposed  without a civil  war, not to speak of  the  oaths taken by Liebknecht and his adherents.   In spite of all  this impending and incalculable misery of famine, theft, murder, destruction of factories and mines, &amp;c, some people delight in deceiving the middle classes with  sounding rhetoric to the effect that they can regain their former status by increased work, economy  or  other virtues   Others  live on apathetically from day to day, haunted  by a  threatening vision and with  total ruin before their eyes.   Perhaps one may ease the last hours of a dying man with lies; but here  it is a question of seeing and admitting with open eyes that the Entente is greedily waiting until Germany, crushed  from  without and torn by dissention within, falls as a trophy into her lap, like a ripe fruit.   To nay mind it would be a  mistake  to  suppose that the Entente  will come  to our assistance, as we went to the assistance of the Baltic provinces.  The Entente will take good care not to expose her soldiers to the danger of being infected  with Bolshevism.   On -the  contrary, they will place  a barrier between their peoples and the German workman.      Moreover, the more the Germans  tear themselves to pieces, the more irreplaceable values are  destroyed, so much the more easily and  quickly  will Germany become a helpless prey; even the doctrinaire Wilson  will realize that the German must be ruled by force like a horde of savages.      Further, I do not  believe that the  German middle classes can and will proceed to help  themselves by their  own  unaided efforts&quot;; it is  too  long  since the  days when citizens were forced, by the position  of their  towns, to defend  themselves.   The  last flicker of the old  fire was in &apos;48 ! since  then people have been accustomed to obey the authorities, and so to-day they obey the orders of the Workmen  and Soldiers&apos; Councils.      It is assumed  that the National Assembly is to restore order and turn the rulers of to-day into workmen once more.   A  really childlike disposition is needed to believe anything of the kind !   Where is the  power to  come from that will induce the  soldiers who have remained loyal to shoot down  their former comrades in droves and force the remainder to work ?     Some people expect help from  Wilson,  but Wilson is dead  politically ; he no longer has  his  country behind him, as was proved by the elections  of  5th November, 1918. On the contrary, that party gained the day,  which considers that the Germans deserve to be exterminated, and ought to be thankful if they are permitted to live on as helots.     The  Imperial German Government were chiefly to blame  for  the  result of the American election.   The  irremediable  mistakes were  made, owing  to  their total ignorance of the  psjrchology of foreign  peoples, when  they approached  Wilson with a  view to procuring an  early Armistice.   They could have approached Wilson in order to inform him that they accepted his 14 points, and to request  him to negotiate with his Allies for a peace on this basis, but he should never have  been approached on the subject of an Armistice.  To begin with, it was a gross insult  to Marshal  Foch.  If the venerable Hindenburg could not go himself, owing to his advanced age, the  Kaiser should have sent Ludendorff to Foch to ask him  for an  armistice, on the ground that Wilson&apos;s points had been accepted.   This would have been the  soldierly way of doing things according to old  established custom, and would have gained the respect  of the enemy; the  admission  that he can fight no longer  is  no dishonour to  a brave man. Instead of this they insulted Marshal Foch,  and with him the  whole French nation, byapproaching a quill-driver on a military matter, as  if he were  the  superior of the man in Supreme  Command.   The consequences are well-known.  Even  worse  consequencesresulted in America, owing to the excess of honour paid to Wilson by the Kaiser.   The American is very suspicious where his politicians are  concerned, and will not permitany  too intimate friendship with European rulers  Twenty-five years ago one of  the candidates for the  Presidency (Cleveland, I believe) lost the election because the English Ambassador had supported his  candidature  in  a press  interview.  Roosevelt, too, lost many of his  former  adherents  owing  to the favour with  which  he was received in Europe, so that he was  not re-elected.  In face of the result of the  American elections,
Wilson  will never dare to say a  word for Germany in  opposition to the western powers; it would be contrary to all American custom, and  the Senate would  very soonreprimand him.     Moreover,  Wilson  has shown  by  his  ambiguous  neutrality  that he  has  nosympathy at all for  Germany.   He wants to ride his hobby-horse, and if the PeaceConoTess can find a way of preserving the text of his  14 points (lit. his hobby-horse !)-he will not trouble much about the fate of Germany.     People  in  Germany forget only too easily  that  Europe is as far removed from america as  America from Europe.   We should not expect an American to take anymore interest in the small  European kingdoms  and their troubles, than we should take,for instance, in the quention of the boundaries of the Sioux  Reservation.   Therefore,.it is not so much to be wondered at when we hear that the  American soldiers Wanted tore-take  Alsace,  but did not know whether it was  a lake or a mountain.  Wilson mayhave known something  about  the Alsace-Lorraine  affair  before the war. because thePeace of Frankfurt came within the range of his studies, but otherwise  his knowledgeof small European  countries is probably  not  very  extensive.   For instance, at theopening of  the Panama  Canal in 1914, Switzerland  was invited to take part in thefestivities, with her Navy ! I only mention this to show that it is  no use placing any hope in Wi!s3n as far as small details are concerned,  all the more since the enemy canapproach him personally in order to gain him  over  to  their point  of view, but not soour delegates.     I think I have sufficiently demonstrated that the popular hope in Wilson is totallywithout foundation.   If  the  Entente  are prevented  from  completing the  ruin ofGermany it will be due to other reasons, namely, the  varied and very often  opposedinterests of  the Allied Powers themselves.  Even if we  could conclude a peace whichwould-be relatively favourable  compared with the  threats in the  enemy newspapers,.two terrible factors would still confront us, i.e., the working classes and  the lack of rawmaterial.  If we  want an export trade which is tantamount to saying if we  want to exist we must  have raw  material, but the  way to it does not lead  via the  peace treaty.  If I had to choose between a Peace Treaty which forbade the  export of rawmaterials to Germany, but knew, however, that the English and American Trusts would send us the raw material, I should prefer  it  to  a Peace  Treaty wherein the  Powerssolemnly declare that Germany can buy as much material as she  likes, knowing thatthe Trusts had agreed not to let Germany  have  any raw material at all.  It would bechildish to hope for raw material in such a case.  The Trusts do  not trouble themselvesabout the  laws of their own countries, which should protect their  countrymen fromexploitation; is it likely  that  they would trouble  about a  scrap  of paper on whichsomething was written which would benefit an enemy and  a trade rival ?     Therefore, whichever  way we  look, we see locked  doors.  The hard facts of  thecase are as follows :      1.  Germany  was greatly over-populated in comparison to her  output of food and clothing, and will be still more so, owing to the loss of  Posen and possibly of WestPrussia.     2.  The deficit in food and clothing can only be made good by trade and industry.     3.  The raw  materials are in the  hands of an enemy  coalition,  on whose goodpleasure will depend the  quantity and quality of raw materials received by Germanyand the price paid for same.     4.  Therefore, the coalition will take care that Germany pays higher prices for rawmaterial than the industries of the Entente  countries, no  matter what the rate ofexchange of the Mark may be.     5.  Only two factors remain, which would enable German industry  to make up forthe disadvantages arising from the above-mentioned  conditions, i.e.     &apos;(a.) More  systematic  methods of manufacture,  and the reduction  of the  colossal           expenses of same by the amalgamation of competing manufacturers (which           again would have the disadvantage of creating monopolies  unfavourable to           younger growing concerns).     (b.) Reduction of wages, at least to the peace time rate, and increase of output.     The last point is the chief point, which would  make  German  industrial)^ once morecapable of competing with foreign countries ;  and precisely this important point seemsto me  to be the  first one  capable  of attainment after great want has brought  theworking classes to their senses.   The working classes  will only  come  to their senseswhen famine and  civil war  have decimated the  population of Germany but  then itwill be too late.(7046)
      I know quite well that a reduction of wages nearly always  means a decrease, in output, for any lowering of the standard of living brings about a dulling of the faculties. It should be remarked here that the disadvantages with which  our industries  have to struggle are so great that we  must demand almost  the  impossible from the  working classes.   It  goes without saying that our working  classes will not  co-operate,  even when they  have awakened from their revolutionary carouse therefore,  as iar as Germany&apos;s  own  powers  go, the future is hopeless.  No raw material, or  dearer raw material, and dear labour and  less  of it, are  enemy  forces with which nothing can cope.  Therefore only one hope remains help from outside!      We are only concerned here with  the three Great Powers France, America and England.      In  my  opinion, France is excluded  on account of her hatred  and  feelings of revenge ; in order  to  help  anyone, you must be well disposed towards them, whereas, in  the case of France, the disposition  is quite the  reverse.   Therefore, it only remains a question of the United States of America or of  England.  I  will first state  the pros and cons as regards America.                                  FOR AMERICA.      1. Her great wealth  of raw material.      2. The modification of the prejudice against Germans, which  prejudice has  been intensified by the Entente Press  to an excessive degree.     As  far as point 1 is concerned,  it  would be  more or less of an illusion, as the Trusts would only  be  interested in a German  undertaking if it were mainly  in   hen- own hands; wherever  this is the case the Trust  would send raw material, no matter to what country the undertaking  ostensibly belonged.     For the majority  of the shares in any undertaking to be in American  hands, is a very dubious  advantage    One might consider it a matjber of indifference to the people whether the coal magnates and &quot;shoddy princes &quot; are Germans  or  Americans,  but this is far from the case   Even supposing- the Americans, wjio controlled the said industry, were ready to carry u  on  in German interests, Germany would lose  greatly even by the loss in taxation-but this favourable aspect of affairs would only  occur if it so happened that German and American interests coincided, but this would rarely happen.   In the opposite case, American  control  would be fatal.  In order  to gain a clear idea of the position, we need only look ai  the American merchant princes in  their own country; we see nothing but a ruthless striving for individual power.   For instance, when it was a question of improving one railway system, the majority of shares in the rival  concern were purchased, and this undertaking was so directed (or mis-directed) that it became bankrupt; in this way competition was destroyed for years, if not for ever.   If Jay Gould managed to enforce  his  election as  chairman of any railway, it meant  nothing less than the ruin of the line-and Jay  Gould has many disciples.  A few months before the war one of the oldest  and best endowed  railway lines (New York, New haven and Hartford) had to declare itself  bankrupt; this masterpiece was  the wrork  of Pierpoint Morgan.     Applying  the  above to our own  conditions, we might think out  the following example : after the war there is no doubt that America  will make great efforts to create a strong mercantile marine ; German competition would obviously&apos; be very much in the way,  therefore it  must be  done  away with.   How is this to be accomplished ?     So far as I know the  Hamburg-America line and the  North German-Lloyd have each a capital of 100 million marks   In order to obtain a controlling interest in the board of superintendence and the board of directors,  it would be necessary to hold shares to the value of about 120 million marks.  According to present rates of exchange  that is not 30 million dollars but only 15 million!  A mere  bagatelle of 15 million dollars would be willingly sacrificed by people who are used to reckoning in  very different sums (it would be one-third of Rockfeller&apos;s yearly income, for instance), in order to promote the growth of their own undertaking, for they would get in return twice or three times as much  as they had sacrificed.     Germany wrould then not only be deprived of these two  great  pillars of her trade, but she would also suffer other irreparable losses.  The Americans would enlist the  bestofficers and officials for the American companies, and  all those industries, officials  and workmen, who have  hitherto earned a good livelihood  owing to the existence of these two great shipping lines, would  suffer heavy loss.  This one example may suffice for all.     The raw materials that we  should receive as a result of  American assistance would be  more than  dearly  bought.   What  should  induce the  trusts to let us have  raw
 material, save their own interests?  We  have nothing to offer the  gentlemen save German property for them to devour.     Point 2 is a point which has hardly been noted in Germany at all, but which plays the most important part as regards the  possible relations between the two countries.     I state most  emphatically, and will substantiate my statement,  that it is  only a question of modifying  the prejudice against Germans, not of removing  it altogether, at least not for the next % 5 years.     When I first came to  the United -&apos;tates of America,  in  1878, there was  no prejudice : on the  contrary, the well-bred German, who came from the educated classes, was held in the highest esteem.   I  need  only recall  the  name  of  Karl Schurz, who became Secretary of State, a distinction which has never fallen to the lot  of any other foreigner ; other Germans have become governors, judges and so forth.     The following are the main reasons  which account for the gradual change of opinion : Up to the seventies, a large  percentage of the  emigrants  from Germany were men of the highest culture, full of ideals, who, oppressed  by  the limited horizon of  the Government at home, could see no  scope for  their  activities in their  own  country. Later -this type of emigrant became  increasingly scarce, as rich opportunities seemed to beckon to them in Germany.  Whilst in  this  way there  were no  new recruits in America of  a  kind calculated to  uphold  German prestige, on  the  other  hand  the Chauvinism of inexperienced, pan-German striplings  made itself gradually noticeable, and was regarded  with the  utmost  disapproval.   The  unfortunate policy  of  the Emperor William II. must  also  be taken into account.   On the  one  side were his endeavours to make himself popular by flattering American millionaires (in Norwegian waters) in reality he arrived at the opposite result, &quot;he made himself cheap &quot; on the other hand his interference, where tact would have  counselled the greatest reserve. For instance, the  attitude taken up during the Boer  War and the  incorrect, because partisan behaviour  of the German Fleet, under Admiral von  Diederichs, towards  the American Fleet in  the harbour of Manila,  where  we were  within  a hairs breadth of a battle.   Admiral Dewey gave Admiral von Diederichs two hours to think things over. The Kaiser not only approved  of the behaviour of the German Fleet, but was further stupid enough  to tell Admiral  von Diederichs  once again,  in a public speech about 10 years ago, that his attitude at Manila had been  quite correct.     A short time ago the  Kaiser  appointed Admiral von Hintze to  be Secretary of State for Foreign  Affairs.   He had no  rest till he had recalled, to the Spaniards that he had  been aide-de-camp to the famous  Admiral von  Diederichs,  on the occasion when the fleet sided with Spain at Manila !     Volumes might be written about all these things, unfortunately they would  not in any way affect the fact  that the  American Navy, since Manila, has  been and will be our sworn enemy.     For 20 years,  every time that American ships  have visited Europe, they have only entered German harbours under special  pressure, and  have only remained just as long as they were ordered to do so, by the Navy Department at Washington.   The officers, when visiting other countries, have made no secret of the  fact that they were hoping and waiting for an opportunity to  fight against  Germany by the side of a European Power.   The first act of the Navy Department, on the outbreak of war, was to take over the German wireless stations.  Germany was thus prevented from communicating news to the American Press, with the result that  American papers, receiving informa- tion from one side only, produced  only  one-sided English  news  and wrote one-sided leading articles.     An American Consul,  well  disposed  to Germany,  said to me when we were discussing the matter in the  second year of the war :  &quot; You may write books later to show the American people that they were lied to, and deceived about the war, but you will not eradicate the first impression, even  with those few people who take the trouble to read  your  books, first impressions are  decisive.&quot;   On every occasion  when  I have discussed our foreign p ilicy with American  friends and acquaintances I have emphasized the fact that the German  people  are  too undeveloped politically, to appreciate  the gravity of William II.&apos;s erratic policy; I can only express my inmost conviction that no sensible man in Germany took the Pan-Germans seriously, or troubled bimself about their plans for conquering the world.    lri  September, 1914  (I  was then living in Holland),  one of my oldest  and bestfriends,  who was for many years editor of a  well-known paper,  wrote to me from new york as follows: &quot;You see that I was right in my views as to Germany&apos;s plans theGerman military party have now involved the whole of Europe  in  war.  They  want to annex Belgium and  the  Congo if they  are victorious,  but  the shameful  disgrace  can
tG never be wiped out.&quot;  I answered, that Reuter must have led him astray, the war was purely  a war  of  defence,  otherwise  it  would have been  impossible to create any enthusiasm for the war in Germany, nothing was required from Belgium but permission to march through the country.   He  replied, &quot;As  an old journalist, I  know ReuterV eternal  lies  far too well to  be deceived.   The phrases and  the false show of peaceful intentions on  the part of  the  German  Government however, do not influence my opinion,  &amp;c.&quot;   I had then  to  cease  corresponding  with him   It  must  be specially noted, that until then my friend had been an enthusiastic  admirer  of  Germany.  He came to Germany almost every winter,  he hated  France  and did not like  England. The  man is an acquaintance  of Wilson, an old fellow student  and party adherent, and he is also friendly with Baker, the War. Secretary.      I have  lingered so long over the question of the popularity  of the  Germans in America (and even then  have  only outlined the facts of the case),  because popularity would play the most important r61e, not only during the war,  not only in  the question of peace, but above all in the question of any connection of  Germany  with  America. Those Americans whose views are now decisive, owing to  the result of the last election. are not  even willing to concede to Germany the grounds agreed upon for the foundation of peace.      1 do not think it is at all likely that America would attempt  to attach us in any way, as she has done, for instance, with  Manila and Cuba.   To accomplish this would entail a protracted discussion in the United States of America dealing with international law.   J^fot only is the case not provided  for in their  constitution, but on the contrary, it is  totally opposed to the spirit of the constitution; as has been shown by the discussions on the subject of Manila.  Since the coming  Congress is opposed to Wilson,  any com- bination with Germany approved by him would be refused.      Speaking  generally, if it is to last,  one  principle applies to every kind of  agree- ment and any combination  with America would come under this head this principle being that both contracting  parties see something in it to their advantage.  The more equally  the advantages  are  divided, the  more prospect there is of both parties being satisfied.  This supposition does not in any way apply to the combination  of Germany with America.  For, as has been stated above, Germany has  nothing to offer America, except to allow7 herself to be exploited ; there is no question of any increase  of power for America.  If there is any idea of obtaining help  from America in combating  the mild presumption of the Czechs and  Poles, Germany will be faced with a bitter disappoint- ment.   For four years the Americans have heard of nothing but the terrible oppression of these people by the Germans ;  how can you expect them to side now7 with the Germans against  the  Slav party ?  This  very  oppression has had  a great  influence on the Americans, and the question is  often asked whether it is really desirable to enter into close relations  with a people  who have been guilty of such oppression.      We must also give  up all thoughts of placing ourselves under the protection of the United  States  of America  for  one or two  years, in order to facilitate an American occupation of the country, which would  protect us  against Bolshevism, until  we  could maintain order in the country unaided by means of a firmly established Citizen Militia. This  idea is attractive, because Germany would be free and  independent in  a few years&apos; time.  But nothing would have been done to protect us against the fettering of trade and industry, nor against the theft which the Slavs have in view.   Further, even if Wilson had courage enough to order the occupation, it w^ould most certainly have to be with- drawn in the spring, owing to the opposition of the Senate and Congress, and Bolshevism would then break out afresh.      Therefore we have nothing to hope from an American Protectorate whatever shape the   connection might  take neither  within, for  the renewal  of  trade  and  normal conditions, nor  without  for  the safeguarding or  our rights against the despotism and rapacity of our enemies.     The situation as  regards England is different I might say  the exact reverse. Apart from the present feelings  of hatred and  revenge, we have only to reckon  there with  practical politicians.     The advantage of  the  great increase of power  which would  ensue  if&apos;Germany became  part of the British  Empire is so palpably obvious, that even  the most rabid enemy of Germany amongst  their leaders might well pause before saying &quot; No&quot;  if the plan  for the recognition of Germany as a colony  were laid before him.   True, we must also consider the  question of unpopularity in England,  since the  English have been heated up to  boiling  point  by the grandoise organization of the North cliff e  Press. When considering how to  behave in the  face of these feelings of hatred and revenge, we must not only think of the present calumnies and venom, but we must go somewhat
&quot;deeper and  examine  previous history without  prejudice.   In doing so we shall find, that as opposed to the favourite catchwords of German energy and technical superiority, the facts, indisputably, are more  or less as follows :       Up to  the seventies  English  goods were  absolutely  the best  in  the world; the competing goods  made  in Germany were cheap imitations.   I  might recall here the famous phrase of Reullaux in 1 876  &quot; cheap and nasty,&quot; German manufactures  improved gradually, which was due  in  no  little degree to the above remark, and the English began to find German competition in the Colonies rather more troublesome.   Further, young German business  men entered English houses as clerks, learnt the  essentials of the  business in  a few  years  and  then, if the principal would  not take them in as partners, they opened  a rival business.    They knew what the customers wanted ; they took English goods, had them  copied in Germany  and became serious rivals to  their former employers, if  indeed  they  did  not completely undermine their  authoritative position in the trade.  Let us be  honest no one likes to be deprived of his possessions, and when  men, who spring  from the great industries in the Rhine provinces, hear and read of the German energy and superiority which has driven English trade off the field, it leaves a peculiar taste in the  mouth.   The fact is, however, that English  industry and  trade have  suffered severely from German  competition, which has not always been open and above board.   In the eighties, political provocation was added to  trade rivalry. Bismarck, to whom shooting clubs,  students&apos; associations, and later, German liberalism, were as a  red rag  to a  bull, always  hated Gladstone and  the Manchester  School. In those days, it was impossible to speak to any English  politician without hearing of the unqualified attacks of  the Kolnische Zeitung on England.   While  up to the end of the century, only  English industry and  trade were  endangered, the policy  of Kaiser William II. all at once aimed a blow at the  Englishman&apos;s Holy of Holies the  British Empire. * This had not happened since Napoleon&apos;s day.   Now everyone took alarm, not only the Liberals  but   the  Conservatives.     Since  the  Boer War  every  single utterance of the Kaiser  had been  listened to  with  suspicion.  The  increase  of the  &apos; fleet,   the   development   of  the  Colonies,  the  attempts  to  interfere  on every  possible occasion  in  every  quarter of  the globe,  proved  to  the English that it  was  a  question  of a  set  purpose,  namely,  to  dispute  the sovereignty of the world with England.  Btilow&apos;s phrase  in the Reichstag,  &quot; a  place in  the sun,&quot; was rightly considered in England  as hypocrisy, for  England  never denied  anyone a place in the  sun, and without the  protection  of England  German trade  would never have flourished in  the 19th century.   This  is  the very reason  for the  .Englishman&apos;s annoyance the Germans have made full  use  of English tolerance, and then prate like charlatans of the superior  knowledge and skill of Germany.   Nobody can blame  the German people for being elated  by their warlike prowess  in  the Franco-German war, and by the re-establishment of the  German Empire, nor for their subsequent efforts to raise themselves from a second to a  first-class  Powor, but it is unjust to reproach the country  at  whose expense this  is accomplished for  defending  itself to  the utmost. There is no doubt that the English wanted the terrible war, which is now drawing to a close.  It matters little what persons or statesmen wrere conspiring with Eussia  behind the scenes.   Individually the English have never made any secret of the fact that war was unavoidable,  whilst the nobility at the same time always stated with emphasis that they personally had no quarrel with Germany.     If the  fleet  continued to increase to such  a  point  that it seriously threatened England&apos;s supremacy then  self-preservation would demand that the German fleet  should be destroyed, before Germany could unite with any other Power  and attack England. (The Emperor William tried this on with France  during the Boer war.)  But, as a peers brother said  to us, &quot; We have no hatred  for the  Germans on this  account,however.  It is only the  business men who are full of hatred, for  their money-bags are threatened, and war will  break out  at the first opportunity.  We soldiers will do  our duty then ;  it is to be  hoped that we shall be victorious, then we  shall shake hands andbe friends once more.&quot;     Fate has decided otherwise.  The flower of the English  aristocracy was soondestroyed, but the hatred of the business men would not die, and  grew like the  many-headed hydra.  This accounts for the cry to destroy German trade and industry.  It isno longer a duel between two rivals but a fight to the death.   Thus  I set my hopes onthe victory of the Conservatives in the coming elections.     If the war had only lasted 6  months our position would have been much  simpler.At that time in England, the old  Conservative Party  (whose  ideas coincided  more orless with  those of our Free Conservatives, National Liberal  and Centre Parties) was
apposed to the Liberals and Radicals, whose ranks are recruited for the most  part, not from  Englishmen, but rather  from naturalized  Germans or men  of directly Germandescent (above all  from German  Jews),  and from Poles,  Russians  and Hungarians.This was  specially  noticeable in the attack on the House of Lords, shortly before thewar.  It was seriously discussed in the inmost  circles  of the Conservative  Party,.whether  the very  foundations  of English nationality were not  threatened by  thetolerant welcome accorded by England to immigrants from every quarter of the globe.This accounts for the stringent laws on alien immigration brought  forward during thecourse of the war.     I have  only been able to  outline the characteristic  features of the questionsoccupying England  at  that  time.   It is obvious  that personal questions play a great part in  these matters as well as principles ;  it is not only on the Left side that thereare demagogues.  There is no doubt, however, that the enemies of Germany, filled withhatred, are to be found on the Left rather than on the Plight side of the House.  Theplan of making Germany into an  autonomous colony of England is likely therefore to appeal more to the Conservative  Party, and the best of it would be that  this plan would agree excellently with the  Germans&apos; ideal of maintaining their  independence.The instinctive repugnance which Germans may feel on first hearing of my  plan will bedue to their belief that Germany is to be treated as a conquered province.    Nothing isfurther  from my thoughts.   The tales of  horror about  Ireland, too. contribute in  nolittle measure to producing a feeling of anxiety amongst Germans.   The case of ireland is entirely different  from that  of the Colonies.   To begin with, the conquest of Irelanddates hack to a time when political freedom was  unknown, then followed religious wars,and during the last century land fell largely into the hands of rich English tradespeople,owing to the impoverishment of the Irish  nobility, who  could not  cope with modernfinancial conditions.  The English did not understand the national  peculiarities of the.small farmers, and demanded their rent, even when the harvests were bad.   If the rentcould not be paid, they enforced the letter of  the law and  evicted their tenants.  Itgoes without saying, that  this is not the only objection which can be raised to Englishrule in Ireland, but it is the act which has most embittered  the Irish, and  which  haschiefly contributed to the state of misery in the country.     I only mention the purchase of Irish  property for this  reason, namely,  that  thesame fate awaits us if  we  do not hold out our hand to the  English in time, that is tosay, before any definite decision has been  arrived at  in England  as to the  completesubjection of Germany  to the Allies.     The English in Ireland proceeded according to the law, and legally nothing can besaid against them ;  and our enemies will behave precisely in the same way to us.   Theywill wait, especially the Belgians, who know our  industry best, until one factory after another gets into difficulties and  is obliged to close down  owing to the lack of rawmaterial (I need only mention the loss of the iron from Lorraine).  Then one  greatfactory after another will be bought up for a mere nothing and they will be especiallycheap for them as the mark is only worth 50 centimes.  They will find means of makingthe labouring classes work, if necessary by force.   This state of servitude shall not andmust not come to pass.  Contrary  to the idea accepted in  Germany, England would never treat  us as  a conquered province.   Canada, Australia and  South  Africa are completely independent.   There is only one thing that the English treat with inexorableand unrelenting severity, and that is any attempt to overthrow the reigning authorities ;in point  of fact,  so long as they are convinced that there is no intention of any  suchattempt, they allow everyone to behave more or less as they like.     Otherwise how could it be  possible  for the Boers, whose wives and children were so  terribly ill-treated  during the  war, to have  become reconciled to the  English soquickly ?  The same Botha who could not find words  enough in  which to abuse theEnglish turned round later against the Germans !     If I were to attempt to characterise the two nations with which we are now concerned,I should say : the American is friendly and open.   He knows that he is the representa-tive of a young nation  with  a future before it.  He knows, too, that there are still manyimperfections in his country, and tries instinctively to improve these defects.   All  thatis great and good in his own country he values  highly, but  at the  same time he doesnot lose his  clearness of vision, and is able to see in what respects any other country issuperior to  his own, and to  appreciate  the  individual  talents of others.   His  firstthought is &quot;we ought  to have that, too,&quot; or &quot;that  man  might be  useful  to us,&quot; and frequently, forgetting  his  own interests,  the American tries to procure the  thing  or person in question for the United States of America.  It  is precisely this very  virtue ofintense patriotism which would  hinder America from  looking after German  interests
  or indeed from considering them at all, always supposing that there was no intention of  exploiting Germany.  The  idea  that  an American would  ever consider Germany as a  part of America is excluded, even if Germany were to give up her own language, the  character of the people would  never become American.  Consequently America  could  never see anything in Germany, but a country to be exploited.       The English  are neither friendly nor open, and therefore are repellant to us.   They  are  less  frank, but they  feel instinctively that foreigners do not understand them, and  therefore they keep silent.  Wherever they assume that they are understood, they are  as open  and talkative as anyone else.      The English are also saturated  with patriotism,  but it finds expression in different  ways.  The Englishman is the representative of an old country, which does not desire  either change or improvement; the average Englishman, when confronted with methods  different to those usual in his own country, contents himself with saying &quot; that it  is not  Pmglish  !&quot;  This is not a criticism ;  the methods of other countries may be very suitable  for those countries, but they are no use to England.   England  has  grown up with her  present methods and they are not  to be tampered with.  This  repellant attitude, this  frequently  arrogant  gesture of refusal  is the cause of our hatred for the  educated  Englishman; I say nothing of the coarseness of the uneducated classes.      If, however, we disregard personal relations, if we are capable of subordinating our  feelings and of thinking first of the living future of the Fatherland, we shall find that  the arrogance with which an Englishman looks down on everything that is not English,  is the very quality which tits him so pre-eminently to have colonies and to govern  them  in the best way for the colonists.  If the  English had not been ^possessed of the real  gift  of ruling, which  is to  have consideration for the country  to be ruled, they could  never have transformed great and extensive countries into flourishing colonies,   Because  the English have  always respected the individual characteristics of a nation, they  have  friends to the death amongst all the  peoples of the earth.      Nothing in the world is perfect, and discontent exists everywhere.  It is impossible  to create a state of European order and  security amongst half-savage peoples without  the use of force, and it is obvious that in this case things are not always as they should be.  When we liste i  to the outcry that  is made now and again in India or in Egypt, we should not forget that the complaint is generally made by some  deposed ruler, who, finds no further opportunity to practice despotism or to enrich himself, in an established state of law and order.  If we want to criticise English rule in India or Egypt we  must remember the good as well  as  the evil that  has been done.  The good far outweighs the evil, and here again I would draw a  comparison between America and England  consider how the natives  live in Egypt and  India, and  then think of the shameful,, treacherous and bloody extermination of the Red Indians by  the Americans.      We have nothing to  hope  from the  Americans, neither by being incorporated into the United  States as a  new state, surrendering our  own  language and individual peculiarities (which incorporation I  consider to be impossible), nor  by being made  a protectorate or a colony.  Under the most favourable conditions America, never having had colonies, would experiment on us at our expense ;  in the great majority of cases we should be exploited by the Trusts and conscienceless politicians.     I now come to the practical  application of my scheme.   Supposing my proposal to find favour with the authorities and  influential men, England should be approached at once  secretly.  It goes without saying that carefully chosen  envoys must be sent,  men who  have lived long  in  the country and have gained a thorough  understanding of English ways of thought.  None of your  Kuhlmanns, who made themselves ridiculous by their  sentimental  admiration for England, and who  cut an absurd figure in the papers even  to this day.  The  English  understand and respect a Germans  love  and reverence for  his  native land, so  long  as  it is genuine  and deep. &apos;  Pan-German Chauvinism  is just as repugnant and contemptible to them, owing  to its insincerity, as sentimental admiration for England.  We must find men  for  this  important mission, men,  who conscious of German worth are calm and  steadfast; thus, from the outset, all idea of our coming as  beggars will be done away  with.   Further, I do not believe that the idea would arise later amongst  the English public that we had begged for mercy (except amongst the naturalised)    The English are accustomed, by their sports, to the idea  that an opponent who has been  beaten  to the ground  and who  declares himself  vanquished  is safe  from further harm. Last, and by no means least important, England (if not the English individually)will reap the greatest advantage by the increase of power.(7C46)B
     Two questions are chiefly important, which might be put more or less as follows: -     &quot; Is England ready, after the conclusion of peace, to take Germany as a colony on the same lines say, as South Africa, and on what conditions f &quot;     The subsidiary question  is : &quot; Is  England ready to take Germany at once under military protection, as a, friend, and therefore with picked and well-disciplined troops ?&quot;     Germany can offer  England colossal advantages  as far as the increase of power is concerned.     1. Future enmity will cease, as the German fleet will be completely dispersed, and the &quot; military police&quot; in the country can be placed under the supreme command of the English.     2.  The English Army and Fleet will be strengthened by German volunteers.     3.  English and German trade will have common political aims.     Alter peace Germany in return will  be prevented from falling into  a state oj servitude and from being ground under the heel of her enemies (amongst these we must reckon the Czechs and the Poles).   This will be accomplished by :      1.  England&apos;s political (and if necessary) military protection against  any attempt at boycotting Germans or German interests in foreign countries.     2.  By the supply of raw materials.     3.  By the throwing open of all English colonies, including our own former colonies, the German, of course, enjoying the same personal rights as the Englishman.     4.  By the tranquility of mind which will result from the knowledge of beini: under protection, without which any reconstruction of trade and industry is unthinkable.     5.  I take  it  for granted, that  the  agreement  will  state that England has to protect German trade and  activities  as if they were her own.   Germany will obtain immediate protection from her enemies and an  advocate at the Peace Conference, as otherwise Wilson  will be out-voted (always supposing, which I  do not  expect, that he has any favourable intentions towards Germany).     The German character will revolt at  first at the idea that we are to lose any part of our  independence.   This  feeling  should give  way on calm deliberation  to  theknowledge that Germany, or rather the Germans, do not  give up their independence, because, if the  truth  is to be spoken, they no  longer  possess  any.  The  collapse of Germany can he foreseen  with  as much  certainty as the astronomers  can  predict an eclipse of the sun.  It is the lesser evil, to  give up an independence that exists only on paper, and to enjoy in return the protection of a great country, which  is racially akin to us, and to whose interest it will be  to set us on our feet again.  Let us at least save what we can,  under the ruling authority of our  racial kinsmen, the  English;  may the United States of free  German peoples  grow out of the ruins of our former prosperity!     We need the strong arm of England, so that peace and order may be restored to the land. The present generation will never know prosperity again, but under Englands protection, we are at least justified in hoping that we shall not be absolutely ruined, but that we may flourish once again, if only by slow degrees.     If  it should happen that France and  Belgium become closely allied with one another, my plan  would find  favour even  with the present English Government, for instead of France  remaining a third  class Power compared with  England (as the - English have already dreamed), France, joined by community of interests with Belgium, would become a dangerous rival to England.  The spirit of industrial enterprise which the French seem to lose  in foreign countries, is much in evidence amongst the Belgians with their great mineral wealth.   Bussia will probably have recovered in 25 years, and will always  be more inclined to join with France than  with England.     In conclusion, I must just mention our &quot; uprooted youth,&quot; who  have increased in numbers enormously,  since a friend of the people coined this phrase 3 years ago.  Since the Revolution, interest centres  chiefly   in the  question of providing soldiers  and workmen with regular work, as sooa as possible ;  this is quite understandable owing to their numbers.   Later  a  more important question for  the State,  however, will be that of securing a future for  the &quot;uprooted youth &quot; of the educated classes, for they are called on to be the leaders of the people.   We  have to deal with thousands of young officers (naval  officers), who have  to face a hopeless future.  New  sources of employment will be opened to them by my plan.  At  first glance it  seems  to  be  the most bitter irony to ask those young men, who risked  life and health for us, to enter an enemy service, still, after the war  of 1866  many  Hanoverians, Hessians and men from Nassau decided  to accept the new conditions, although with  heavy  hearts.   At  that
time Prussia was no less hated than England, and acted far more as a conqueror  thanthe English would ever think of doing.  United Germany gradually reconciled the menof those days to the hardness of their fate, which destroyed their dreams and hopes andtore them  away from old-established conditions.  What  1 have said  with regard  toofficers applies equally to those of our young  men who remain  at home.  Instead  ofsighing under a &quot; foreign yoke,&quot; in a few years&apos; time Germans will look  around themwith astonishment and see how much more freedom and civic rights they enjoy underthe ruling authority of England than ihey did even after the last  concessions made  on paper by the Kaiser and the licence of the Revolution.     Who can see into the future ?     Why should not a great Germania grow out of the union with England, in whichthe countries of Germany would form one great people, with  the descendants  of theAnglo-Saxons and the Normans?   To-day it is only an isolated dream; it seems to methat it could be turned into- reality after one or two generations had passed.    First of all hatred and prejudice on both sides must disappear.                      SUPPLEMENT-9TH  FEBRUARY,  1919.      It is 8 weeks since the above outline of my ideas was sent to some of my friends for their opinion.   About a fortnight ago the answer came :      &quot; Your ideas and plans met with no approval.&quot;      If in spite of this I make another attempt  to make my ideas known to a larger circle,  it is because I believe that  since then circumstances have  shown  the  utter hopelessness of the outlook as to the future of  Germany.   Far from  trying  loyally  to carry out Wilsons points, our worst enemies are only trying to draw7 the noose tighter about Germany&apos;s  neck  (not  to  speak of French intrigues).   Anyone who had any knowledge  of conditions in  the United  States of America knew beforehand  that Wilson&apos;s influence only hung by a thread, for he was defeated with loud acclamations  at the last elections.  Even the last Congress, in which Wilson had  a majority,  agreed  to his request for one hundred million  dollars to  procure  food for Europe, but  expressly excluded Germany from benefiting thereby.    What will happen in about  4 weeks&apos; time, when a  Congress opposed to Wilson and to Germany takes  the  helm of the  ship of State?   Wilsons 14 points may be  carried through in  the  letter, but they will not be carried out in the spirit.    According to the  letter our colonies cannot be annexed, but the Allied  peoples  can very well divide up our colonies amongst our enemies for administration;   it will  be an administration  after the style adopted by Austria  in Bosnia and Herzegovina.   On paper, these countries remained under the sovereignty  of the Sultan; de facto, this  sovereignty  was only a figure of speech, and orders and regulations  were  issued only by Vienna.   Here, at least, it was to the advantage of the country, for Austria-Hungary, by her  devoted  tvork, turned a desert into a civilized country.  What  will  be the  case with our colonies, which will be administered chiefly with  a view to the  destruction of Germany ?  Let us, too, imagine a permanent French administration in the Rhine provinces which is quite within the range of possibilities  all things German would be done for.     It would be  out of place to make any comparison with the French rule of  100 years ago, for the conditions are almost exactly reversed.   On paper the Rhine provinces will not be annexed, but they will be made a Protectorate of France, customs frontiers  will be set up between the provinces and  Germany, and traffic will be hindered in every way by passport difficulties.  The  letter  of the  agreement will be observed, and the public who wish to think things are for the best will be lulled to sleep.   If Wilson&apos;s intentions were  honest,  he would  have protested long  ago against  the terrible oppression in Alsace-Lorraine.  In my former paper  and in several letters, I have pointed out that  it is urgently necessary that the plan of Germany&apos;s becoming an autonomous English colony should be made known in England at once.   It  is necessary for the following reasons:      1. In order to influence the elections so that Lloyd George and his Germanophobe adherents should  not obtain too great a majority, the announcement of such a plan would moderate the ideas of many people who are  still shouting &quot; Victory &quot; without thinking much what they are saying.    2. The  knowledge that such a plan existed would hinder even the present English Government from entering into any binding agreement with  their Allies, and would atleast cause them to  oppose the attempt to destroy Germany completely.(7040;
     3. It is also necessary to  make  the plan known if we desire  to  arouse a lively feeling in England against the Bolsheviks, where the increase of Bolshevism is regarded to-day partly  with  amusement and  partly with distress.   With amusement, because they are delighted the more Germany is rendered powerless by internal dissension ; and with distress, because valuable property, &amp;c, is being destroyed, which our enemies hoped would fall into their hands.   The remarks  regarding  Bolshevism within and without Germany apply equally to the pressure exercised on our Eastern frontiers by the Czechs and Poles.  Six weeks of valuable time have passed by unused.   The honest German cannot believe  that his enemies really mean what they have said and threatened.   That would be the end of Germany, and &quot;  that is unthinkable,&apos;&quot; so my warning has fallen on deaf ears.   Lloyd George reigns supreme, and everything points to a close alliance with America and France, particularly as far as trade and  industry are  concerned.     Everyone  is fully acquainted with all that has passed meanwhile at home, but what is not  known, and what should be  brought to the notice of the middle classes in the papers daily, is the fact that our enemies, and also neutrals, have lost all respect for us, Hate,  so to  say, has disappeared, but has  given  place to something  worse contempt! And we are to  blame, we middle classes !   That we should allow ourselves to be mastered by a handful of madmen and criminals is incomprehensible and despicable to our enemies, whose civilization rests on the shoulders of the middle class.   It is very doubtful  if the English would  have anything to do with us to-day.     I strongly recommend the reading of the December number of the  South German monthly,  called &quot; The Collapse.&quot;   In  the first article Professor Paul Nikolaus Cossman* (page  147) writes as follows :  &quot; We are  convinced that our enemies desire  nothing but the total destruction of Germany,  and hope to enrich themselves at the  expense  of the Central Powers.  All other aims  that are attributed  to  them are  German  illusions,&quot; He  then fully  substantiates this  statement..  On page 161, Professor  Cossman  says, &quot; Many Germans now say, not only is the German people considered incapable of further existence, but also it is considered  unworthy to  exist;  a people  which behaved as the Germans  did in  Germany  behind the fighting  line deserves to  go under,&quot;  &amp;c.   He replies: &quot; We do not deny that this represents opinion in foreign countries.   The hatred which  surrounded us at the outbreak  of war gave place during the course of the war to contempt for our politics, combined  with admiration for our  military  achievements; after the  Revolution, absolute contempt replaced these mingled feelings.   Anyone who in such a case makes accusations against his own countrymen is no &apos; gentleman&apos;  in the eyes of the English.   The  flattery of their prisoners, the threat  that Bolshevism  will spread into their  countries, only  produce amongst  our enemies  the silence of utterscorn.&quot;     I  entirely agree with Professor Cossmans words, but I  must emphasize  the point that my proposal is designed to prevent  foreign  countries from considering  that  theGerman people  is definitely unworthy to exist.  It is  not  unworthy,  nor dishonourable, to acknowledge weakness, even if one is to blame for it.   It  is not the business of  this paper to discuss the  grounds of the weakness, which requires  more strength  to overcomethan our  people now have at their command.  We only have to deal here with the factthat our people are not strung enough for  the  task.  I should  only like to say that where  internal  suppuration occurs we  should not blame the stomach, the lungs or thekidneys, but the mind and soul alone.   In the midst of the political ruin which is going on  before all eyes, the Americans,  at all events, have made good progress in buying upGerman securities; that this statement  is founded  on  fact can  be  confirmed at  anybank.  The Americans  ;dso have  emissaries spread  over the whole  of  Germany, who supply the  Government or the Trusts who employ  them with exact information as towhat is going  on.   Whether these gentlemen  have suggested that Germany should become a Protectorate of America in order to escape ruin, or whether  the idea originatedamongst our own people is difficult  to decide, it suffices to say the  idea does exist.     As to this 1 can only say I  take  back nothing of what I have  said as to the American character; it was nothing  bad, and every honest American would agree with me.  Yet to-day, I  say  that I should rejoice if Germany were  to become an  American Protectorate, supposing that it is  not  to  combine with England, for in the last two months our helplessness has increased to an impossible degree,  and it is a thousandtimes better for every  one of our industries to fall into  the hands of the Americans    * I must state emphatically that I have not the honour of knowing Professor Oossman.  I do not knoweither if he would agree with  my deductions, although he has arrived  at the same results as myselfconcerning the hopeless position of Germany and the intention of our enemies to destroy us.  Perhaps evenhe would be startled.  His views are the result of acute observation and reflection.  I regard the facts inthe woy to which I have become accustomed by years of experience amongst our present enemies.
 -(the  middle classes live and flourish  over there too in spite of the Trusts) than for us  to retain  a Germany  which would  be independent on  paper whilst  the  Germans  would be under the heel of French, Belgian, Czech and Polish usurpers.      No power  in heaven or on earth will bring our labouring classes to their senses for  years to come, least of all the weak requests and proclamations issued by the Government.  Our young workmen are  for  the most part  children, credulous, trusting  children;  otherwise  they would  not  have believed the  whisperings  of  the Russians,  of the  Independents and the Spartacist party.  Many of them, however, tormented by doubts,  have turned to the educated classes for advice, for they feel instinctively that  it  is a  question not only of the existence of Germany,  but also of  the individual  German, and  specially of the workers.  The foolish struggle between the middle class parties  at the last elections was certainly  not calculated to  teach  a young workman, who  had just returned from active service, anything about the condition  of his native land.  Instead of wasting time  in discussing whether Church and education should be separated  or not, the  only necessary  question should have  been  asked:  &quot;Can Church and education continue to exist ?&quot;  Slaves need no schools.  I  hardly think that the Israelites in  Lower Egypt were bothered with  compulsory  education.  The fight as to whether to establish militia or an army on the old lines is equally unnecessary.   The important question  is : &quot;Are we even capable of maintaining our own military police, or must order be main- tained by  enemy occupation ?&quot; ;  and  still it goes on with questions of socialization, nationalization, &amp;c, and valuable time  is wasted.  Instead  of the middle classes  and Majority Socialists combining and organizing in order to inform the young men as to the great questions  of the fate of their country, they have split up into parties, and have offered the hungry nothing but the stone of political strife.     Thus we are preparing for a National Assembly, which may work out a Constitution, but will not have power to enforce it.   The confidence even of well-disposed workers  has been destroyed.   They would much rather  obey  a command issued by England or America which will be carried  through,  than  listen  to  the sloppy  compromises or indecisive proclamations asking them to be good  enough to  return to work.  Do not let us forget what the proclamation really requires very hard work for starvation wages. English competition has already reached a point where  in the  Westphalian industries, it is only possible to pay starvation wages, if we are to export with any hope of success. It is hardly to be wondered at, therefore, if one manufacturer after another is faced with the alternative of either closing down  his  factory or.selling  it to a  foreigner.  The foreigner knows  what he is about,  Before  the end of the year, famine and misery will be so rampant in the country that the labouring classes will be only too pleased to earn their bread with a foreign employer   They will submit themselves more readily  even for starvation wages to  strangers, whose Government  has  gained respect by absolutely  consistent  action, than to  their  own people.   Professor  Cossman says, page 156, &quot;They (our enemies) will reintroduce the system  of small States, if  they do not divide Germany up  amongst  her  enemies,  since it is  a question  of making any reunion  and any return of economic prosperity for  ever impossible.   They will also decide as to the question of  Republic or Monarchy; the wishes of the German people will not be taken into  consideration.   As soon  as a sufficient number have  died  of hunger the rest  will be ready to accept any  form of government which  guarantees them food.&quot;     The  behaviour  of many English  officers  and  soldiers in the  Rhine Army  of Occupation  is said to  be hardly calculated to  make  them liked by the  good German citizens.   People forget too easily when they criticize  that the English  are now  in an enemy country, and that owing to the long  war and absence from  home  their manners have suffered, just as those of our soldiers did when they were in the west.  Doubtless it is frequently their intention to make the Rhinelander, at all events, feel something of the effects  of an enemy occupation.  If the English  show  ostentatious contempt on account of the &quot; Spartacus &quot; conditions  in Germany and the cringing behaviour of  many Germans, there  is  nothing  to be said,  except  that  this contempt is not altogether unfounded.     The American may create a better impression, but it is  only because he does not betray his feelings so openly; they are exactly the same.  I had to refer to this because, with reference to  my hope that the  English  colonies would provide a field  of activityfor our  young men,  I  was told  that  &quot; these   arrogant creatures would make lifeunbearable to our soldiers.&quot;  To  this I would reply that a man who is worthy of respectwill find it more  quickly amongst  the  English  than amongst any other people.  TheEnglish are  certainly not appreciative of sham merit.  To prove that I am not alone inmy opinion,  that our young  officers should find employment abroad (that is to say with
 our former enemies), I quote the concluding sentence of a letter from a senior Wurtem- burg officer to the Schwabische Merhur No. 48, 30th January, 1919.      &quot; Whilst a change to another profession is possible for quite young officers, although it may not be easy, any change of occupation seems to be almost impossible for men of middle age.  Could you blame such a man  very deeply if he entered the service  of the enemy, driven either by necessity or  a desire at, least  to  continue  in his profession? Even our bitterest enemies would certainly treat the &apos; Boche &apos; better and more decently than the German officer was  treated  by  his  compatriots during the  Revolution, and it seems highly probable that he will  be more appreciated in future in America, Japan or England than in the German Fatherland.   Many an honest German  of every class and profession will be driven into  exile, instead  of &apos; helping in the reconstruction,&apos;  Let us, therefore, have &apos; equal rights for all&apos; and &apos; a free path for the capable&apos; in the sense that the capable man may choose his career wherever  he  pleases according to his own ideas.&apos;&apos;     In the summer of 1916, things looked  very  bad on  our Western front, and many asked anxiously what would happen if the enemy broke through and gained the Rhine* I answered &quot;one-third will emigrate,  one-third will die  of  hunger or commit suicide, and the rest will become paid slaves under  foreign masters,&quot;  At  that  time my words were considered to be &quot; the ravings of an anxious brain,&quot; they will become reality if a mighty country will not take pity on us.     If I take private information, received  from all parts of the country, as a standard by which to estimate the feelings of those circles  who are able to judge  of the economic position,  I know  that I am not painting too black a picture,  far from it!     I ask you to consider what 1 have said  here from the point  of view of reason and not of sentiment.   The  point to be decided is this:  &quot;Is what has been said actwdly true?and not: &quot; Does it agree with my personal wishes or  feelings ? &quot;     The future  of Germany  is at stake. Who  will assume the  responsibility for the death of millions of his fellow countrymen  by %mine or pestilence, merely because his personal  honour or his feeling as to what  is right and proper concerning his country is offended  by the kind of assistance proposed.     The time has passed when the Government and the parties, from  Conservatives to Social Democrats,  declared that Germany would never accept  a humiliating  peace. Never ! !  !  In reality the acceptance of the first Armistice  conditions was humiliating, and the conditions which followed brought degradation which can never be effaced.  No sensible man will make the Armistice Commission responsible for  that.   Circumstances are stronger than the best intentions or powers of this Commission or  of the Govern- ment, and circumstances at the conclusion of peace will be stronger than the Government, for they will be stronger than the German people.     Test what has been  said carefully.   If  facts can be found to disprove my state- ments, then refuse.     If my statements cannot be  disproved, then  see  what  other  methods can  be proposed to spve  us in our need, and test the possibility of carrying them out.     I have not heard of any proposal  that does not break down at the first test.   If a universal confiscation  of property averaging 20 per cent, is proposed,  a laughably small sum would be procured when compared with our liabilities :  if the amount confiscated were doubled, trade  and  all  normal activities would be brought to a standstill, not to speak of the difficulty of collecting the money. This has been explained and proved so often that it is unnecessary to waste words upon it.   To ask for  assistance is neither humiliating nor  dishonourable  since  we  are  asking for  help against oppression with which we are threatened in consequence of broken faith.   .     Nothing but the strong arm of some benevolent Power can help us out  of our trouble!     Necessity is  the mother of invention, perhaps someone else will find some better way of securing England&apos;s help than myself.     In conclusion,  I ask you to weigh the following seven points carefully :      1.  The unfortunate result of the 4^- years&apos; war has plunged Germany into an abyss from which she cannot emerge without help from outside.     2.  Germany is forced to seek a connection with some great Power,  and for political and economic reasons, England is the only Power that can be considered.     3.  This connection is, however, not only a necessity of the hour caused by pressure of circumstances, but is a well-considered  measure for the future good of Germany.
     4.  The contemplated League of Nations needs  a  leader, in Europe, at all events. England has shown by her past history that  she  can wielct a  universal policy under which the most heterogeneous elements can be gathered together in perfect concord.     5.  In recognition of this fact, Germany as a State, places herself under the leader-: ship of  England, and thus foregoes an individual foreign policy.     6.  After Germany has been the first State to show the way, it is to be hoped that the other States of Europe will in time follow suit  and that thus &quot; The United States of Europe&quot;  will come into existence under the Presidency of England.     7.  Such a union would be necessary, not in enmity against America and  Asia, but in order to counterbalance any possible future policy on their part,  which would aim at-obtaining the domination of the world.     Though Germany should place herself under  England&apos;s leadership, it would not mean that she acknowledged as justified England&apos;s policy of the blockade, and other measures she adopted  during  the war, which were  contrary to international law. Germany would merely testify by her act, that she  considered England to be the only great Power which is capable of leading Europe with  any hope of success, in spite ofher faults and weaknesses.     The whole of Europe, as we know it, is now in danger.                                                            9th February, 1919.
