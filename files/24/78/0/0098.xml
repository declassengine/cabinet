Justice S&amp;rgant,bo myirLdence                             (1)                                              April loth 1919.                 Letter. from lr*i Jusjtice JRoche.Dear Sir,          JEn reference to your letter of April 8th and enclosuresoontainihg Board of Trade proposals dated March 51st, I hog to observe,   I gave evidence upon this subject before the Board ofTrade&apos;Committee presided over by Lord Buckmaster  (see theirReport Cd, 8975) and for my views in extenso I must refer to thetranscript of my evidence, a copy of which is doubtless in thehands of the Board of Trade,   It may bo convenient, however,if I summarise my evidence and present view as follows.     1,   I think the proposed legislation is necessary and Isgenerally on proper lines,   I dislike interfering with contractsbut the effects of this war are so profound as to pass all ex-pectation,   I very much prefer ad hoc legislation to strainingthe common law and leading it away from the doctrine that loseon a contract Is no excuse for non-performance,     2,,   I advocated before the Committee and ad hoc tribunal of a mixed character presided over by a Judge and resemblingthe Railway and Canal Commission,   Hy reasons were that I donot like.involving the Courts in their ordinary Jurisdiction inthese matters and amongst the number of judges in the superiorand inferior Courts so many differences of view are likely to appear upon these questions as to bewilder the.public and notto advantage the public services of the Judges,          I note however that the Committee in their Kenort didnot adopt this view and in these circumstances I should feelhesitation in suggesting that I desire to insistently press my own view as correct - the more so as the Act of 1917 makes theCourt in general the tribunal.          As to the details of the proposals:     (a)  I should myself prefer that the whole of this proposedprocedure lapsed before the expiration of 3 years.   If applica-tions can be made by either party an extension&apos; of 1 year beyondthe 6 months ought in my judgment to suffice,     (b)  If the Act is to apply to post war contracts. - and itis to be observed that the 1917 Act Subsection 2 applies to allcontracts, - then in my judgment January 1st 1916 Is too earlya date.   The most serious changes of conditions in certaindirections took place after that date.   There would seem to bea certain reasonable consistency in the following plan (1) toextend section 1(1) of the Act of 1917 In.time and scope but tokeep Its application to pre-war contracts,   (2) to similarlyextend section 1(2) of the Act of 1917 and to preserve its application to all contracts.                                 Yours sincerely,Sir Claud Schuster, K.C,, C.V.O.(Sgd)  A.  ADAIR ROCHE.
                   Letter from for. Justice Younger.                                                   28th April,1919.*Iy dear Schuster,     Preoccupation at the end of last term and the vacation havealike delayed my reply to 7our letter of the 8th inst. with reference.to the proposals to extend the Courts (Pmergency Powers) Act 1917.I had however looked into the patter &quot;before the Courts rose, and I now set forth the conclusion at which I have arrived.     Except that I should doubt the fairness of extending the newdate beyond January 1st 1916 fo&apos;1 by that tine the eyes of all menwere I think open to the situation,,  I am in hearty agreement withthe Board of Trade&apos;s memorandum.  I think the situation is one inwhich the Court should be left to do justice in every case as itsees it, due regard being had to the conduct of both parties.  Iam specially in favour of subcl. f..  I doubt whether any otherdecision was open to Bargent than that which lie gave in the Metro-politan Supply Coy. v. London County Council, and in the particular case one would not have wished, it to he otherwise.     But the grounds on which it proceeded showed the necessity forfurther power being given to the Court in other cases and&apos; the factthat Lush J. in an earlier case seems to have assumed it possessedthe further power cannot, I think, be relied, on in face of Sargent1sjudgment and. his reasons.  I therefore very strongly approve of (f),and although I speak with less knowledge of the other proposalsparticularly e.g.(d), they all appear to me wise and useful, andmost worthy of acceptance.                                  Yours very sincerely,                                &apos;    (Bgd)  ROBFRT YOUNGER *                                (3)                     Note by k.r. Justice Sar-gant.     V.y recent decision in Metropolitan Electric Light Co. v. L.C.C.&quot;was, so far as It decided any general questions under the section,given under the compulsion of the wording of the Statute;  and. was quite contrary to what I should have desired to decide, had it beenpossible..     Speaking generally, I think that very extended-powers on thelines proposed by the Board of Trade should be given to the Courts,and in particular that there should, be an amendment of the Act of1917 to at least the extent mentioned in sub-head (f) of the Memo-randum.  It is true that very difficult and delicate tasks may thenbe imposed on the Courts and tasks that are to sorce e-tent difficult in their mature from those with v*h 1.ch we ordinarily have to deal.But it seems to we that the work has to be 9 or ought to be - done&apos;by someone.  And. on the whole the Judges seem to me the persons bestfitted, to do it.(Signed)  C.  H.  SARGANT.
