At present  they only  appear to work 2 or 3 hours per  day.           .,7ith  reference to the  vessels &quot;Hercules&quot;, &quot;Hamburg&quot;.  &quot;Stint&quot;;  &quot;Surop&quot;, &quot;Nagutschi&quot; and &quot;0stsee&quot;i  which are demanded  for the Esthonian Government. Admiral Gootte has been informed ;; .,  that  they are claimed under Article  15 of the terms of Armistice.,  as they were  taken from  lursia by Germany.   Should  Admiral Goette  claim that  they are German ships, their surrender is demanded  under the agreement at Troves of 17th January.           The Senior Naval Officer at Libau  reports that the       I  Germans have  officially  and definitely refused&quot;permission for the  i  mobilisation  of the Lettish Army, and he  considers  that this  matter should be  dealt with in Paris at once.  The  necessity for  supplies  of boots and uniforms to Latvia  is  afiain pointed out.           Anarchy now reifinc  at  Bifta.  There is no  administration,  \  Bolshevik or  otherwise,  and systematic massacres by the mob are  taking place.   The inhabitants are beinp:  transported wholesale tq  Bazonholni  on the river  for deliberate starvation.  The German  troops on that  front are restive because  tbey are unable to advance,  and relieve Riga, since  the sea  blockade  prevents adequate supplies  and reinforcements.  The Baltic  troops also  are most anxious to go  forward.           The Senior Naval Officer at Libau  suggested reconnoitring  Riga, and,  ice  conditions  permittin/r, taking destroyers up the  river, informing  the German command  of his intentions, ana possibly  embarking some  troops.   He urrces  that supplies by  sea for the  German army  in  Latvia should  be  permitted at once.  He has been  informed  that his proposals are  not  approved, and that co-oneration  with  the  Germans  cannot  be permitted; but that Paris has been asked  to rrant  permission to land German reinforcements and military  supplies  at Libau.

About 90 British subjects remained in the town at their own roauest. and it is believed that they will be in no danger; some 25,000 Russian and Greek refugees were evacuated.  British men-of-war took part in the evacuation and rendered assistance.-  The Greek refugees are being sent to Salonika.           H.M. Consul General is of opinion that the evacuation was quite unnecessary and due mainly to the weakness of the French General in command.  He states that,although the British were not directly implicated in the fall of the town, Russians cannot forgive1 them for permitting the French to carry out the evacuation, and that in consequence Allied prestige in South Russia has suffered severely.           Bolshevik troops.; have entered the Crimea and captured- Simferopol and the lav sian volunteers and Greek troops are retiring on Sevastopol.   The french have received orders to hold Sevastopol, but they are short of troops; some reinforcements are being sent from Oonstanza.

The word &quot;surrender&quot; in Article 22 Terms of Armistice  is and has always been understood by the Allied and Associated Governments to mean &quot;permanent transfer&quot; and not merely ihe &quot;handing over for military security&quot; which is the interpretation now  placed upon it.by Germany.
