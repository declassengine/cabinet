&apos;-f mrsiJociWferH is tSe Property of 11&apos;g..make&apos;&quot;&quot;&quot;p. jMajstst/s Covernment.BIS OH        /4yy Memorandum from the Board of Trade.sssss--  j^g Board of Tirade have received representations both   from individuals and from Associations (including Chambers   of Commerce and the Federation of British Industries) to the   effect that the Government should ooiapensate producers and   traders for losses arising in consequence of the war,  or in   consequence of the signing of the Armistice,  in connection   with the ftdfilment of contracts made either befpre the war,   or in the early days of the ,7ar.        The ground on which the Government arc ashed to assume   responsibility is broadly that the losses arise out of a   national emergenoy which could not havo been foreseen.  Lord   Buc&amp;maste^s Committee on Pre-war Contracts reported in favour   of some allowance from public funds being made in certain cases.        $he problem cannot be solved entirely by legislation to   strengthen the hands of sellers in their attempts to get buyers   to agree to reasonable pries compromises,   as the only possible   compromises might leave the producers with heavy losses to bear.   But such legislation seems desirable,  and a memorandum on the   subject has been put forward to the Home Affairs Committee.        On the Ration of Government responsibility,  the Board   of Trade,  after careful consideration, make the following   recommendations ons:-         (1)  The principle, should be accepted of granting some              allowance from public funds in cases where the              following conditions are fulfilled:                    (a) That the loss is due to the direct asfcion                        of the Government.  This would have    be                        defined.                    (b) That it is shown that the  business concerned,                        If commitments outstanding at the date of the                        signing of the Armidrtios were fulfilled,  would                        have suffered loss on balance on all its under-                        tahings between that date  and the outbreak of                        Viar *         (2)  The claims should be dealt with by the Defence of the              Realm Losses Commission^  (This would involve an              extension of the terms of reference to the Commission              since at present it does not deal with losses arising              through the enforcement of any order or regulation of              general application,  but only with applicants whose              property or business has been the subject of direct              and particular interference,  such as between subjects              would have given cause of action for damages).18        I shwild  be glad to have a deoision on the above recommend-   relations in order that a definite answer may be given to the numerous   applications received.                                 (Sgd) A.C.GEOTS3.                                                 18.4.&apos;19.   $ The terms of reference of the Defence of the Realm tosses Commission   in their latest form under the ^arrant of December 1918 are to enquire   into and determine,  and to report what sums (in cases not otherwise   provided for) ought in reason and fairness to be paid out of public   funds to applicants (not being subjects of an enemy State) in respect   ifcC&apos; direct and substantial loss incurred and damage sustained by them   by reason of interference with their property or business in the   [United Kingdom through the ezercise by the Crown of its rights and   Uuties in the Defence of the Ileahn.
