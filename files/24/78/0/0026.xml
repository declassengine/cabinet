During the past woek the Department served Noticesof their intention to make certificates of default under the ThiruSohodule of the Corn Production Act, 1917, on two occupiers, who, inthe Departments opinion, had failed, without reasonable causo, tocultivate tho minimum tillage portion of their holdingB.

Tho woather during the week wan variable, some daysbeing mild and spring-likfr while on other days growth and tillageoperations wore checked by harsh Winds and rain.  On&apos;  the whole,however, conditions were soaoOnablo and good progress was made withoat sowing and potato planting, the former operations being givonpriority as a rule.   In southern counties and other oarly districtsthe bulk of the grain crop is sown and pptato planting is nearingcomplotifrn.                            FARM LABOUR            A very serious strike of farm labourers is in progressin County Donegal, and in certain other districts the attitude of thelabourers is also creating difficulty and chocking the progress of cultivation.   In County Galway, work has been handioapped by theeffects of tho influenza/which was particularly severe in that county.                      epidemic16/4/19.
FARM MACHINERY.

A remarkable extension in the use of farm implements and machinery is reported from backward districts in the West of Ireland. In many of these districts the plough has very generally taken the place of the spade. Were it not for this improvement the difficulty in carrying out this year&apos;s tillage would have been greatly intensified.



ARTIFICIAL MANURES.

A shortage of superphosphate is reported from many counties due principally to transit difficulties. Efforts are being made to arrange for an improved supply for the later sown root crops on which this fertiliser is extensively used.



FLAX.

Flax Growing Operations. Very little flax has yet been sown except in a few very early districts.

Labour. In County Donegal the flax scutchers struck work in sympathy with the farm labourers. As the scutching season is drawing to an end in that district the strike of scutchers is now a matter of minor importance. Is is understood that the strike of farm labourers in County Down is collapsing. Reports received by the Department indicate that as a result of the strikes that have occurred farmers generally have decided to sow a considerably smaller acreage of flax than they had originally intended to do.

Prices for Flax for 1919. Reports were recently received by the Department that a belief existed among flax growers in all parts of the country that the Government had withdrawn their guarantee of prices for the 1919 crop, and that as a consequence many farmers had decided to sow oats instead of flax. In order to reassure farmers as to the situation the Department issued press notices in newspapers circulating in the flax growing areas announcing that no change had been made in the Government&apos;s arrangements as announced by the Flax Control Board last January.

Demand for Flaxseed. The demand for flaxseed continues dull.

Flax Seed (Ireland) Order, 1918. Thirty-one permits have been issued during the week authorising the scutching and sale of the flax of growers who were defaulters under the Order.

Sale of Flaxseed (Ireland) Order, 1918. The Department have under consideration the question of appointing an inspector to examine merchants&apos; books, etc., with a view to ascertaining whether they are complying with the terms of the above Order.

MAINTENANCE OF LIVE STOCK.

During the period from the 8th to the 14th instant, inclusive, applications for licences were received as follows:-

 To slaughter or export heifers................. 218

 To slaughter bulls or bullocks.................  29

 To export milch cows........................... 119
