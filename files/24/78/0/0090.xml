/ThSoj^ggiimRnt js the Property of    Britannic  M; majesty^s Government)      I enclose the Eeports of the Committees of the War Office and Air Ministry upon the proposals of the Jerram Committee on the Pay of the Navy.      It is  a great pity that this matter should  have been allowed to reach its present position without  the departments charged  with the welfare of  the  other two fighting Services being in any way apprised of what  was going forward.  I cannot agree that a Committee  composed exclusively of naval officers could, without representatives of the other two Services or civilian guidance, take  the comprehensive and general view which is required.      Enquiries of the kind conducted by the Jerram Committee might quite properly have been held with a  view to exploring the subject,  and I have  no  doubt  that  had similar enquiries been set on foot in the Army  and the Air Force, and had representatives of the soldiers and airmen been allowed freely to put forward their  claims, reports very similar to that now presented by the Jerram Committee would be available.      But the next stage, it seems to me, should be the examination of  these departmental and individual reports by a strong Cabinet Committee, including the heads of the Depart- ments involved, as the result of which definite and general proposals could be  made to the Cabinet, with full estimates of cost,  on which action could immediately be taken.   It is also clear  that the Ministers engaged in  this enquiry should have before them, in general outline, at any rate, the scale of the  post-war Navy, Army and Air Force, for obviously, within certain limits, it is a question  of balancing one set of considerations against another. I do not see even now why this should  not be done.  It must be remembered that we are not fixing temporary rates of pay, but permanent post-war rates for long service engage- men ts, and that therefore the&apos;: whole future of our defensive forces is involved.      There is one point, however, on  which I must express the strongest opinion.  If the increases and privileges of the  Jerram  Report are accorded to the Navy, I cannot accept,&quot; on  behalf of  the  Army or the Air  Force, an  inferior  equivalent treatment rank  for rank, age for  age, service  for  service.   The life of the  British soldier  in time of peace is just as hard as that of the sailor;  from some points of view it is harder.   Far from his home for  4 and 5 years  together  in unhealthy climates,&quot; under tropical  skies,  in an enforced  celibacy, with  practically no female companionship of his own  race, no contact with the sights and sounds of his own  land,  he has as  good a claim upon the goodwill of his fellow countrymen as any sailor in  the fine squadrons which cruise around our Island. When war  comes the lot of the soldier is infinitely  harder  than  that of the sailor.      (B19/221) 70 5/19 H&amp;S  7114-two
Dwelling in the mud and filth of  the trenches, or in miserable burrows and ruins, or inthe East in stifling tents,  often  without  regular food or comforts of any  kind, he iscompelled to endure risks and injuries which during, the present struggle, have exceededmore than  twenty-fold  those experienced by  the  Navy.*   It would be a  monstrousinjustice and fatal to the new army that we are endeavouring  to create, to impose uponthe soldier  a  definite inferiority  of remuneration, like for  like, compared to his navalcomrade.     The Cabinet should  observe that the application of the Jerram Report principles tothe Army and Air Force  would add a total  of nearly  18 millions to the annual cost of  thepost-war army as at present calculated, and would  entail a further addition of  at least4^ millions to the cost of the British Army in India.   No attempt has been made to tracethe re-actions that would be produced upon the native army.   It is clear, therefore, that whatever be the calculations on which  the Chancellor of  the Exchequer based his figureof 110  millions  for the  normal post-war  cost  of our defensive services, the adoption ofthese proposals would require that figure to be completely revised.     I hope that all these matters may be seriously considered.                                                    WINSTON S.

Present:Finance Member,Adjutant-General,        ^                 L War OfficeDeputy Chief of the Imperial General Staff,  fDirector of Personal Services,Lieut.-General Sir H. Cox, India Office.                              Secretary, Mr. Paterson,  War Office.For Pensions Mr.  Ashley, War Office.    Pay. Had the Admiralty not put forward these proposals which amount to aminimum daily rate of 4s. for the trained marine and  able seaman, the Army council would not have proposed going beyond 3s. at most for the trained infantry long-serviceprivate, as the permanent post-war rate, with a considerably lower rate for the recruitduring his period of training.    It is, however, obvious that it will be quite impossible to maintain a satisfactoryarmy if the basic rate of pay is materially lower than that to be given to the royal marines, and  we are  of opinion that, speaking generally, the rates proposed  for theRoyal Marines must be  taken as the basis for the long-service army infantry.  the exact scale and its combination with pay for good-conduct badges, which we  considershould be reintroduced at the same daily rate as that to be approved for the Navy, is amatter for further consideration when the principle is settled.   Generally speaking weshould take 4s. for the trained private of infantry, with no increments with length ofservice, but with extra for good-conduct badges.    The rate of pay should be the same for all arms, and, in the case of cavalry, artillery and infantry, should  absorb proficiency pay, but should be supplemented by engineerand corps pay in the case of the technical arms.    Separation, children&apos;s,  &amp;c,  allowance. We do not  clearly understand  theAdmiralty  proposals,  but we do not  consider  that the grant of childrens allowancewithout separation allowance  for  the  wife  is  satisfactory.   In  our  opinion  it is preferable to give a rather lower rate of  pay with  separation  allowance and children&apos;allowance than a higher rate of pay out of which the man provides for his wife.    We are opposed  to the  principle of an  unlimited married establishment, both  on grounds of expense and of administrative difficulties.    Parents&apos;  and dependants&apos; allowance should, in our opinion, automatically disappearwhen we revert to a peace footing.    Antedate. We are  opposed most strongly to any antedate.  For administrativereasons it is most undesirable to have to open up millions of closed accounts men whohave already lift the Army would not really-get  much satisfaction from an antedate,and if any date  prior to 1st May were selected the question would be complicated  bythe inclusion  of  the demobilizable  men,  who get no occupation bonus unless detainedafter 1st May.  The selection of 1st May avoids this difficulty.(B19/221) 70 5/19 H&amp;S 7114-3wo
                               SUBSIDIARY POINTS.    Long service and good-conduct medal. Army is equally concerned.    Leave allowance already exists under peace regulations.    Subsistence allowance. Army equally concerned.    Hospital stoppages. We agree with Admiralty proposal to apply also to Army.    Non-substantive pay. The same principle will probably have  to apply to variousadditional emoluments in the Army.   This  will  need further consideration.    Health insurance. -If done for Navy  must be done for Army.  We are  strongly against this proposal, which is contrary to whole spirit of the Insurance Act, and would form a dangerous precedent, tending to the destruction of the contributory basis.  .  Railway passes on leave. If done for  Navy must apply to Army.  We are against this proposal, preferring the pre-war system of tickets  at  special  rates  in view of thelarge increases in pay.    Conveyance of families, &amp;c. Already provided for in Army Peace Regulations.    The Air Force representatives concur generally with the above  as regards  the AirForce.    Army. The cost of these proposals (compared with pre-war rates), estimated veryroughly and based on pre-war establishments, will be  for the British  establishments(Imperial Exchequer), 11,000,0007. per annum;  for the  British establishment  in India(Indian Exchequer), 4,500,000/. per annum.  The Indian figure makes no allowance forany possible consequential effect ori the native troops.    The Air Force will cost a further 3,000,000/.   Total,  14,000,000/. for British, and4,500,000/. for Indian Exchequer.                             PART II-PENSIONS.    In the case of pensions as in that of pay, the War Office and  Air  Ministry  wouldhave been content with a more modest scheme had not the Admiralty put forward their proposals.  We consider that some increase in the present rate of pension is necessary,and we should have proposed an increase to 2s. a day.  The Admiralty  propose to treblethe Navy pension (lid.  per day).    If this is approved for the Navy, it must without (question be applied to the Armyand Air Force as well.   We think that the pensions of all the three services should beput on exactly  the same scale and basis, the services  with  longer  terms of service,  ofcourse, getting a proportionately higher rate for the longer service.    In our opinion  the  best way to deal with increase  of pension is  to give a scalegraduated for age, e.g., a higher rate at  55 and a still higher rate  at  65, with a com-paratively low rate for a lower age, while a man is capable of earning his living.  Thissystem has the advantage of discouraging a life  of idleness at the age of, say 45, andwould mitigate the  reduction in income as the man ceases to be a wage-earner.    The whole matter needs further consideration before the Admiralty proposals are agreed to.    Taking the Admiralty proposals from (b) onwards :     Disability pensions. We await the definite Admiralty proposals.    Age pensions. No remarks.   This is a  step in the direction of the system weadvocate, but we  should not advocate  these extra  grants in  addition to treble thepresent rate of pension.   Neither War  Office nor Air Ministry  have funds with which to meet them and the cost would fall on the State in  their case.     Wounds pensions. Neither the War  Office nor  the Air Ministry  would have raised this point,  apart from  Admiralty.   If the  Navy get it the Army and Air force must  of  course participate.    Commutation of pension. We agree.     Wages of pensioner. We agree.    Application of new scale. No definite conclusion was  arrived at  as  regards  pen-sioners now serving and those who have served during the war.  There are two classes,(1) those who became  time-expired during  the war   and  began to draw pension,(2) those who were pensioners when the war began.  The first class have a strong claimto be  treated like future pensioners, but it is  difficult to differentiate  them from thesecond class.  Again, it is difficult to differentiate the second class  from pensioners whohave  not served.  In the Army and Air Force a pensioner does not increase his pensionby further service.
  ADDITIONAL  REMARKS BY AIR  MINISTRY ON THE JERRAM COMMITTEE PROPOSALS.     The Air Ministry feel that if the rates for the trained Royal Marine, able seaman and various technical classes were approved,  the general  average  of the rates for corresponding  classes  in the Air Force  would  have to be  brought into line.   In particular, the high  rates for skilled men would  have a serious financial effect for the Air Ministry,  inasmuch as over 5 per  cent, of the Royal Air  Force  belong to technical trades.     In criticism of the Admiralty proposals, they would point out that there is not the same obligation to give very high rates to men who have entered  as boys  and received their technical training in the Service.   And further, they would  have thought it sufficient to fix the base rates  for the fully trained man at 3s.  (apart from technical qualifications).     At the same time it  is not  clear that  the Admiralty typical rate  of 4s. would necessitate the same rate being adopted by the  other Services.  It is believed that there was already a difference in peace time in favour of the marine as  compared with the infantryman.   Moreover,  it would appear that the proposed  rates of  pay  include provision for maintenance of a wife, seeing that separation allowance for a  wife is  to  be withdrawn.  From this, it  would follow that the 3s. rate just referred to would be the proper corresponding rate for the infantryman if separation allowance  for  married men is continued.  This coincides with the present 3s. rate (Is. 6c/. plus war bonus,  Is. 6d.) which it is understood  cannot in the Cabinets view be  reduced.    The Air Ministry  draw the attention to the fact that  material increases in emolu-ments will  have the direct effect of reducing the numbers which can  be maintained from the available funds.    They would draw  a clear distinction between title  to separation allowance and the married establishment.  It may well be  decided  on  grounds  of policy that any man     To give all  pensioners the  new  rates is, as  the  Admiralty  say,  a  question ofaffecting all pensioners of every Government service.  We  can  only leave  this matter to the Cabinet who ban direct it to receive further consideration if they think fit.     Widows and children.&apos; This is a proposal which the War  office and Air ministry would not put forward had the Admiralty not done so.   If it is granted for Navy theArmy and Air Force must of course follow suit;   The Army  and Air  Force  do not desire to encourage matrimony, by offering financial  inducements,  on account of the physical  difficulties  and great cost  involved in  housing and transporting  soldiers&apos;families all over the world.  If the Navy  grant financial inducements,  irrespective ofany married establishment, it will be impossible for the War Office and Air Ministrytb withhold them entirely or to limit them to a small married establishment.     Cost. The  Navy proposals  are estimated to cost  1;000,0007.  per  annum at the start, rising to   800,000/.  The corresponding figures for the  Army  (British) would be1,300,0007.,  rising to 3,900,000/., with a further 500,000/:, rising to  1,500,000/.  for theGovernment of India.  These estimates are based on the numbers of the pre-war Army;For tire Air Force&apos;the extra cost would be 300,000/., rising  to 1,000,000/.     The Adjutant-General presses that if heavy pension charges for  service pensionersare to be incurred in the  Army, following on the initiative of the Admiraliy, which theArmy Council do not consider necessary, except as the result of the Admiralty action,the  whole charge for and administration  of  service pension  (including widbws&apos; andchildren&apos;s pension) should be transferred from Army Votes and the&apos; Army Council to theMinistry of Pensions.   Otherwise, if the charge is borne on Army Votes  the pensionerwill inevitably eat up almost the whole sum available for the Army.     It should be  noted that any increase of the pay and pension of the  private soldieron the rates, plus bonus now paid, will involve  a further  increase  in the  case of theofficers.  The cost of this is not included in the estimates.     A note by the Air Ministry is appended.                                 Signed, on behalf of the Committee,                                                             H.  W. FORSTEK  1st May, 1919
who married  shall be entitled to  certain rates of separation allowance, but that this-will not carry full married establishment privileges, except on a restricted percentage., t&amp;iThere is no pre-war basis  on which  a  comparison of cost for the  Air Force wouldbe  founded.   For immediate purposes,  it might  be  taken that the  increase will beproportionate to that estimated for the Army.    As regards pensions, the Air Force Regulations give a daily rate for  each year  of&quot;service which varies from f of a Id. to 1-g of a  lo!. according to the  non-technical  or technical nature of the duties.  The Admiralty scale would force this  rate up to  l^d.on  a  flat basis.   Generally speaking, the Air Ministry feel that the pensions question might properly be withdrawn from this  discussion and referred  to the Worthington-Evans Committee which the  Cabinet has just appointed.    In  conclusion, the Air Ministry takes the view that on all matters which affect thecivil population (such as separation allowance, initial  pay of recruits, and pensions)there should be real co-ordination between the Services, and that one Service should notdiverge from the others.   There are also certain general matters within  the Services,.such as good-conduct pay, which should be kept in line.                                                           (Sd.)     J. S.
