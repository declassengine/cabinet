fffhffs document is tho property.of His Britannic Majesty1 s Government,),Secret,WAR CABLH2T.Agricultural Labour&quot;.Memorandum &quot;by the President of the Board of Agrioulture               and Fisheries.    [l\   $he general position ato regards agricultural labour has&quot;been rendered critical by the recent Army Order under which men in agricultural Companies will fee recalled for military duty.    Promevery County Agricultural Committee reports and consideredresolutions have been submitted to the Board urging that the decision should be at once reviewed.   The terras in which they express them-eelvee shew in their own words that they view with &quot;alarm&quot;,  &quot;dismay&quot;and &quot;consternation&quot; the order to recall these men.    -They all ask that these men shall be left on the land as essential&apos;pivotal men for whose release tliey took no specific action, because it  was understood that the men would be released to carry on agricultural work without interruption.   If this Order is not revised,  employmentin the industry will be gravely lessened, as the men in questionnaire skilled leaders.   Large farmers are concerned equally  withthose whose holdings are small and with these who are small-holdersin the technical sense.   Small tenant farmers who cannot pay forhired labour, much less fer the management of their holdings, willbe effected without hope or prospect of being able to carry on bydeputy.   They will have to sell out or be financially ruined.    (2)   The following resolution submitted by the Farmers&apos; Union tothe Board apears to sum Up quite reasonably and faii*ly on broad*lines tho possibility of a serioue disaster if the definite stepefesuggested therein are not carried into effect:-        &quot;That the Pa timer s* Union deprecate the calling up of     men of Agricultural Companies, but at the same time realise     that the War Office do not intend tc give way on the matter.     To meet the urgency of this case our Union press upon  your     Lordship to meet the Authorities in the matter by simply asking     for a proportion of the Agricultural Companies, that is the     pivotal and indispensable men on farms, such as - skilled     horsemen, tractor drivers, cowmen, stockmen, fanners them-     selves in occupation of land, far^ managers, or men of     Agricultural Companies living in their own homes, and  that     these men be demobilised at once.         This would only mean the retention of a proportion of     men in Agricultural Companies.   We would point out that we     were promised the return of a certain number of pivotal men     from the Army, and only a proportion of these have been     returned.         All the men to whom this resolution refers are     essentially pivotal men, who would have been applied for, for     release rs such,  except for the definite understanding that     they would be released automatically without application.         Ve would suggest that each County V/ar Agricultural     Committee should investigate the various cases of     indispensable men in Labour Corps.&quot;
219       (3)   The  quickest  procedure by which thia evident alarm might be  disposed  of v/ould be  to sanction direct action for demobilisation in  specific  oases, where the War Executive Committees are prepared to  declare the men indispensable.   It is not sought to retain all or  even a large proportion of  the men in agricultural companies, only  such as are truly &quot;pivotal  men&quot; and fcr whom application as such  would have been made  had it not been expected that aft they were on  the  farms they would  be demobilised automatically.       (4)   Some specific cases may be referred to in  support of the  general statements  made:-            (a)  Hr.  Henry Overman, Norfolk, has applied te be allowed       to retain two  men both of whom are at present untrained as       soldiers, but  as agriculturists they are very highly ekilled.       Under the Order  these  men have received notice  to rejoin.   One       of these  men is  responsible personally for farming 1,500 acres       for  Mr. Overman.   This man&apos;s category is C.II  and was Grade II       on re-examination.            (b)  A tenant farmer in Gloucestershire  farming 400 acres       has  received notice to rejoin.   He joined the  Army  in 1916, v/as       returned  to an agricultural company in 1917 and has been       farming hie own  land  since.   He is not eligible for release and       though a  pivatal man he v/as not claimed as such by the County       Committee for  the reasons already given.            (c)  Lancashire reports a oaae of a tenant farmer whose       holding is 30  acres.    He has received notice as in  other       cases.   Five  aores are arable, three are fnuit orchard, he       ha3  13 head of dairy  cattle, 2 horses, 4 pigs and numerous       poultry.   He  works single-handed with no help  except his wife;       his  medical category  is B.III.   He has seen service and has       been in six hospitals, was  invalided home from  France with       trench fever.    He is  not,  however, eligible fcr release under       current instructions.       (5)   I am in a position to  supplement these eases by  innumerable ether instances, and I strongly urge that the Board may i  be empowered to act as indicated in paragraph 3 of this memorandum.28th April, 1919.
