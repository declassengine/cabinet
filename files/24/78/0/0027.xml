(jfeDjjcmnent is the  Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s(-Government.]CONFIDENTIAL.POLITICAL INTELLIGENCE DEPARTMENT,          FOREIGN OFFICE.                 ^SWITZERLAND  /003.[April 7, 1919.]92(11150.)TlMEMORANDUMONTHE INTERNATIONAL SOCIALIST CONFERENCE AT BERNE  OF               FEBRUARY 1919 AND ITS OUTCOME.      THE following Memorandum aims at providing, for the purposes of record, a  connected narrative  of  the  proceedings at  the Berne International  Socialist.  Conference of February last, with a complete list of the delegates, and notes on the  principal personalities who took part in it and on the chief events which followed it.     1.  The Berne International Socialist Conference was the realisation of an idea which for many months had been in the minds of various Allied Socialist and Labour leaders, of  calling together,  at the same  time as the  official Peace Conference,  a Labour and Socialist Conference for the purpose of influencing the decisions of the belligerent Governments.   At the Leeds Inter-Allied  Conference of the General Federation of Trade Unions, July 5-7,1916, the proposal was discussed at length, but here feeling was in favour of reconstituting the Trade Union Internationale and confining its discussions to questions  that have a trade union and social character, and in fact a resolution * was passed to this effect.    A  Socialist and political Internationale was not uppermost in  the minds of the  Allied Trade Union leaders, the majority of whom were  strongly in favour of the British Government&apos;s war policy.   As events showed, however, it was the non-union-element, represented by such men as Mr. Ramsay Macdonald, which gained the upper hand.    2.  Towards the end of  October  1918,  when  the  war was obviously drawing quickly to its close, there was  a great deal of activity in connection with the proposed International Trade Union  and  Socialist Conferences.  Mr. Arthur  Henderson would have gone  to Paris on the 25th  October  to consult M.  Vandervelde, M. Thomas, and Mr.  Gompers, but for the fact that he was prevented by a  strike of members  of  the  Sailors&apos; and Firemen&apos;s  Union.  On  the Trade Union side M. Oudegeest, the Dutch secretary of  the International Trades Union Federation, was very active.  At the end of October he  went to Berlin  to confer with Karl Legien, the extremely patriotic German Trade Union leader.   The  plan was to have an International Trade Union Conference side by side with the International Socialist Conference, and for the same object, namely, that of influencing the decision of the official Peace Congress, which was believed to be imminent.  Both  conferences were in fact held, but  for  the  reason  which has been  indicated  it was  the  political Socialist Conference which secured by far the greater share of attention, and must in consequence be discussed  almost exclusively in this  memorandum.  The  double meeting at Berne in fact was a convincing demonstration of  the way in which the International Trades Union movement had been elbowed aside by  the International Socialist movement, with its wider and  more ambitious  political programme.    3. On the  18th  November a meeting was held in London to select the British delegates.  For some time the time and place of the conference was kept secret, for fear of a repetition of the seamen&apos;s boycott M.  Camille Huysmans had also been prevented from crossing the Channel but it was later  known that a gathering at lausanne for January 6th  had been decided upon.   *&quot;That this Conference, held at Leeds on the 5th July, accepts the project of organising an international conference before the negotiation for peace;  the date, the place, and agenda of the conference to be statedlater on after an agreement is arrived at by the organisations interested.  This agenda will be limited to questions that have a trade union and social character.&quot;[11301-482B
     4. Three obstacles to the conference soon appeared.  The first was the oprposi- tion of the Belgians and Americans to the project; the second, the opposition of the Swiss extremists; and the third, the opposition of the Swiss non-Socialists.  The objection of the Belgians  was to so early a meeting  with enemy delegates for the purpose of discussing  either&apos; trade union or socialist subjects, an, objection which was shared by one or two English Labour leaders, notably Mr. Clynes and Mr.  Will Thorne, who had  been proposed  as  delegates,  as  also  by  the Americans of the Gompers group. The last-named, moreover, had an aversion on principle from any international Socialistic conference whatever, and wished to set up a purely economic or trade union  Internationale.  As this fundamental  cleavage in the working-class movement has no bearing on the main narrative, however, it need not  be discussed here.     The Swiss  Socialist Party, who were to be called upon to offer hospitality to the reconstituted Socialist Internationale, were in a position of great  uncertainty. On the 11th November they had supported a general strike, which the authorities had had little difficulty in crushing by means of a mobilisation of the  army.   This somewhat ignominious collapse of the method of &quot; direct action &quot;  had a sobering effect on the party, and when it met in  general congress  on  the 21st December the feeling, as expressed in the leading resolutions  for the  election of the President and the choice of headquarters the moderate Gustav Miiller and the opportunist Berne  being chosen respectively was in favour of moderation^     Nevertheless, the strike had excited  great hostility to Socialism in non-Socialist circles, particularly in French-speaking Switzerland, and this, combined  with certain revelations of the systematic revolutionary propaganda undertaken  in  Switzerland ,by the Bolshevik Mission, f led first of  all to reluctance  on  the part of the Swiss authorities to grant passports to the foreign delegates,  and secondly to a clear mani- festation by the Lausannois  that they did not desire  to have the conference.   The first objection was overcome, the second could not be there would have been a risk, so  the Swiss  Government informed Sir Horace Rumbold, of open  assault on the delegates and  eventually Berne was chosen as the place at which the conference wrould be held; the date was fixed for the 3rd February.     5. One of the first results of  the  Conference was  to  complete the cleavage which  for some  time had been growing in the ranks of the Swiss Social-Democratic Party.  From the first mention of the project, as has  been indicated, the extremist section of the party had been hostile to participation in what they characterised as a bourgeois assembly, an endeavour to revive the discredited  Second  Internationale. What they wished was, as Trotsky and Lenin advocated in writings which had been given a wide circulation in Switzerland by various Bolshevik  propagandist agencies, the establishment of a new communist and revolutionary Internationale, of which the Zimmerwald^: and Kienthal^ conferences  had been  the precursors.   Thanks to the  persuasive agitation and eloquent advocacy of this view by Fritz Platten, Lenin&apos;s friend, and a young and vigorous revolutionary of Saxon descent, an Extra- ordinary Party) Congress &quot;of She Swiss Social  Democrats  on the 2nd Felbruary decided by a large majoritv (238 to 147) not to take part in the Berne  Conference. Thereupon the  moderate  Gustav  Miiller, who had been elected President in  the previous  December,  resigned  office and was   replaced by  the  Zimmerwaldian Reinhardt.  Muller&apos;s letter, announcing his party&apos;s decision and his own resigna- tion, was  one of the first documents read by Branting on opening the Conference as President on the 3rd February.     6. Although not  all the  following-for  example,  the Frish  delegates,  and certain individuals such as Fritz Adler-were present at  the commencement of the proceedings,  owing to passport difficulties, it  will be convenient to give here  the official list of all the representatives who attended the Conference.

On the above list it may be noted, first, that Belgium, Serbia, Rumania, and Lithuania were entirely unrepresented, Lithuania because the headquarters of the Social-Democratic Party at Vilna were in possession of the Bolsheviks, the remaining countries from their own free will, or, as  in the case of Rumania^ in particular,because the delegates were prevented by the authorities; secondly, that  the printing of the names of the United States delegates in the official bulletin of the Conference was  disingenuous, since the first, Frank Bohn,  representing the pro-war minority-of the American Socialist Party, was, on intervening,  prevented from  speaking by the British  and French delegates on the ground that he was not properly accredited, while Herron namely, Dr. George D. Herron though a Socialist, could not very well  have been accredited by any party, and was presumably  at the Conference fulfilling his well-known role of political observer for the United States  Government, in whose confidence he stands.   The third  point is that the Italian delegation, asappeared from a communication  of  the Italian Social Democrat, Morgari, to theZimmerwaldian &quot; Volksrecht &quot;  of the 15th February, was  sent to the Conferenceunder the impression ,that it was a genuine Social-Democratic gathering, and withthe instruction to take no part  should it be a &quot; Social patriotic &quot; assembly.  Dis-coveritfg that it was the  latter, the Italian delegation did not participate,  and in strict accuracy should not be mentioned in the list of accredited delegates.  Asprinted, in  fact, and as announced with each batch of arrivals at the Conferenceitself by Mr. Huysmans,  the list of representatives gives the impression of  having.been  deliberately inflated.    8. Note ,should also be taken of certain  individual publicists and journalists;who.  though not officially accredited to the  Conference, were in Berne  at the time,playing a part behind the scenes.   Mr. H. N. Brailsford, for example,  was atthe time  in Berne, on his way  to Vienna, and  contributed an  impression  of theConference  to  the &quot; Herald.&quot;   *  The Rumanian  Social-Democratic  Party sent a telegram to the Conference protesting againstRumanian atrocities in the Banat and in  Transylvania, and urging the creation of an independent  Republicin both provinces, divided into cantons.
       Otto Pohl, editor of the Vienna  &quot; Arbeiter-Zeitung,&quot;  was also in Berne dur-   ing the Conference,  carrying on, it is reported from a trustworthy source,  press   work and propaganda in favour of the  union of  German-Austria with Germany.   Prom another  very reliable source it is learned that Parvus, the notorious German   Majority Socialist propagandist, was very active  during the Conference.*   The   accusation that he had been and was at that time carrying on German propaganda   was strongly denied by him, but the undoubted facts remain, first that he is in close   touch with the German Minister, and secondly that, although originally  an impe-   cunious Social Revolutionary, he is now living in comparatively lavish style.  These   are sufficient to warrant serious suspicion.       Edouard Bernstein, against  whom a decree of expulsion of April 1888, for   attacking the German Government in the Plottingen &quot; Socialdemokrat,&quot; has not yet   been, withdrawn, was allowed by the Swiss authorities to be present in Switzerland   for one month, and took Haase&apos;s place after the  latter had  left for the  Weimar   Assembly.  From an  English delegate who met him it is learned that he expects to   be  nominated as first  German Ambassador to London after the final conclusion of.   peace.       The last  non-accredited personality of  whom  it is  advisable to  take note is a   certain John de Kay, who, from numerous  confidential reports, is known to have   played  an important  part behind the scenes  at the Conference. This man, by some   not too reputable piece of business in Mexico, became very wealthy, and during the   war gained a certain amount of notoriety by publishing in three languages a vague   piece of  pacifist  propaganda entitled &quot; The World-Allies,&quot; which was  lavishly   distributed  during 1917. During the Conference he seems to have been a. kind of   patron, and to have paid the hotel  bills of  certain of the delegates.  He was  also   entrusted with the press side of the  Conference, and was responsible for the issue    at his own  expense, it appears from a confidential report of all the official bulle-   tins.f His residence  is  at the Schloss Steinhof, a castle near Lucerne, which he   is reported  to have bought soon after his  arrival in Switzerland.^      9.  Although the impression has been given in London that the Conference would   principally  concern itself with  questions of Labour legislation   Mr.  Henderson   before  starting had granted an interview foreshadowing  a charter of international   labour legislation it was clear  in the first place that influential Social Democrats   would place political questions in the forefront, and secondly that at an international   conference there could not fail to be a collision between the German Majority  dele-   gates and the  loyal groups of Entente Social Democrats.  The latter occurred in&apos;  the first session, the 3rd February.  After Mr. Henderson&apos;s introductory speech and   M.  Branting&apos;s presidential oration,  M. Albert Thomas rose to move a resolution  to insert in the Order of the Day of the  Conference the question  of  governmental  responsibility  for  the  origin of the war, and the  Socialist  responsibility involved   therein; also,  as a second point, a statement on the menace of Bolshevism to the  future  of  Social  Democracy.   The  first  part of  the resolution  was  a direct  challenge   to   the  German Social - Democratic   Majority.   At the  beginning  of the  evening session  it was deprecated by the Zimmerwaldian French  delegate,  jyTistral, who asserted that all Socialists  had  done their best to prevent  the  war,  and wished the  Conference to  send its  greetings  to  the  German  and  Russian  revolutions  respectively.  The defence of  the German Majority was then taken up  by the  German Majority delegate, Wels, who accused Thomas of wishing  to brand  German Social Democrats and exclude them from the reconstituted Internationale.  This would lead to disunion among  the working classes and &quot;weaken the resistance  to Bolshevism.   As regards German Socialist support for the war, Wels justified  it by pointing to the  Russian menace.  Though the German Social Democrats had  protested  against the ultimatum to  Serbia, and had attempted to  localise the con-  conflict they could not declare a general strike when the Russian invasion of Germany  was beginning.  The  invasion of Belgium and the various outrages  against inter-  national law had  been protested against  by them, but the Conference  should not  forget  also  the Ententes starvation war,  which had caused the  death of 700,000  people.  . . . Thomas&apos;s support to Kerensky  had led to the triumph of Bolshevism.  It was hoped that the Conference would reject his resolution.      After Wels&apos; speech Renaudel came to the support of Thomas&apos;s resolution.  The  question was not so much between the German Social Democrats  and the French      * He was arrested just before the Conference, but released on the intervention of his intimate friend,  *Dr. Adolf  Miiller, the present German Minister in Berne.      t The advertisement stated that these may be obtained from John de Kay, Schloss Steinhof, Lucerne..      $ From a letter from de Kay to a friend in England it would also appear that he is concerned in certain  Eastern matters, probably the Young Egyptians.  He also seems to be negotiating as intermediary on behalf  of the &quot;Daily Herald &quot; for the supply of a news service from Switzerland.
 as between the German Majority and the German Minority; the Internationale had to choose between the two.   He recalled  Scheidemann&apos;s wholehearted support of the German Government, and Hermann Muller&apos;s reassuring visit to Paris in 1914, forty-eight hours before the  German Government&apos;s ultimatum to France.    Had the French Government been as responsible  as the German  Government, French. Socialists would not have supported it.  At the close of this session it was announced that Seitz had been recalled to  Vienna and that Ellenbogen would take his place; further, that a group of Swiss Socialists the National Griitli group  is meant- had applied for admission to the Conference,  but  would  only be received as guests, as the Conference did not wish to intervene in  the dispute in. the Swiss Social Democratic Party.     10. On the resumption of the Conference on the following morning the first speaker was  Kurt Eisner,  who in his speech admitted Germany&apos;s- guilt and the necessity for  expiation.  He urged, however, that the  transformation which had taken place in Germany was genuine.   In  regard  to Wels&apos; speech, he asserted that the German Government had exploited the fear of Czarism and  at first had de- ceived himself, until he read the German White Book.   The German Majority must  acknowledge their fault.   Social Democrats in Germany should have over- thrown the Government.     This speech was  answered  by  Hermann  M idler, who again asserted that the Russian mobilisation, compelled Germany to act.     The next speaker, was Karl Kautsky, who in. reply to the Majority  accusations- tions  against Russia  asserted that  the German  Government&apos;s guilt for the war was clearly established by the documents.     In the afternoon session Mr. Stuart Banning continued this debate on the re- sponsibility for the war.  He declared that the Governments which Thomas wished to punish for causing the war no longer existed,  and maintained  that  if Eisner&apos;s impressive declaration could be  followed by the German Majority a great step to- war ds reconciliation would be made.   On the other hand, the English delegates begged Thomas not to turn a war of Governments into  a war of peoples.     11. The pro-French Alsatian Democrat, Grumhach, appealed in the same  terms to the German Majority to take their stand on  Eisner&apos;s and Kautsky&apos;s declaration.     The Esthonian delegate, Martna,  maintained that  conditions in his country had not improved since the German revolution;  the same policy of expropriation was still being carried on.     The principal passage of the speech by Troeistra, the next  speaker, was a pro- test against  the sweeping condemnation of Bolshevism  which  Thomas had made. He considered that the first task of the Conference was to reunite the international proletariat.  In this connection  it may be noted that Troeistra,  in a private inter- view before setting out for  the  Conference, laid  it down that one definite  piece of work for the Conference to do was to bring pressure to bear on the American Government to mitigate its treatment of Social Democrat agitators, another  piece of evidence that Troeistra, in the  interests of working-class solidarity, is by no means anxious to break with the extremists.     Longuet,  who spoke aifter Troeistra,  was concerned to maintain the guilt  of all sides. - There had been imperialism and chauvinism in Germany, but it was now raising its head in Paris, Rome, and London.  The Internationale would find  unity. on the, lines of the. speeches of Eisner and Kautsky.  Troeistra was right  in. pro- testing against the wholesale condemnation  of Bolshevism.     The Russian Social Revolutionary, Gavronsky, who had escaped from the Bol- sheviks, maintained that the  Bolsheviks had  excluded themselves  from the  Inter- nationale and urged practical sympathy with  the German Revolution.     The Hungarian Socialist, Buchinger,  asserted that  his party had by strikes attempted to maintain the point of view of  Kautsky and Haase.     The Danish Socialist, Borgbjerg, attacked both the  German Majority and the French Socialists for not having done enough to prevent the war.     Amid great enthusiasm, Fritz Adler next rose to speak.  He  asserted the re- sponsibility of the Austrian Government for  the  war, and revealed the fact  that on the 5th July Count Hoyos went to Berlin  carrying a letter from the Emperor Francis Joseph to WTilhelm II,  and on that day  war  was decided upon, in com- plicity with Bethmann-Hollweg.  From the 7th July onwards the whole of Austria prepared for  war.   He was prohibited from revealing this  fact at his trial as the proceedings would then have had  to&apos; be in secret.  He was no Bolshevik, but did not believe in condemning people in their absence.       [1130]-482         &quot;                                          C
     During this session there were nominated commissions for the study of War Responsibility, the League of Nations, and Territorial Questions.     12. The  session of the 5th February  and part of the morning session  of the 6th February were given up to a discussion of the League of Nations,  Mr. J. H. Thomas, who spoke first, insisted that the  League of Nations must be made part of the Peace Settlement, and that it must be open to all  nations.  He appealed to the German delegates to say that the spirit of militarism in Germany was dead.     Herman Miiller answered this challenge by saying  that German Socialism would never set up  militarism again.  The  citizen  army which had been created  would not be used for any aggressive purpose.     The report  and resolution on the League of Nations was then  brought for- ward  and declared to have  been passed unanimously in  the Special Commission appointed to  study it.  Included in the resolution were the following terms: The League  of Nations shall be, formed by the Parliaments of the  different countries and must be based on a real peace of justice; all the nations organised on the basis of self-determination shall be  included in the League, while such peoples as have not yet obtained self-determination shall be encouraged to fit themselves for member- ship, under the protection of the League; the League  must create an International Court of Mediation and Arbitration;  it must abolish  all standing armies and con- trol any armed force it may be necessary to retain; it must prevent economic war by the establishment of free  trade; its function  should include the  establishment and control of  an International Labour Charter.  An amendment,  proposed by Mr. Ramsay  Macdonald,  demanded  that the League shall be  composed,  not of Government representatives,  but of elected representatives of the Parliaments.     13.  Mr. Ramsay Macdonald was the next speaker.  He declared for a League of Nations including all peoples, and deplored the statement of the German Majority Socialists about the citizen army.  He appealed to the German Social  Democrats to withdraw this from their programme.     Messrs. Troelstra, Bienstock, Locker who emphasised the Jewish point of view  Milhaud, Cachin, and Mrs.  Snowden, all of whom  were  in general agreement, were the next speakers.     The Report of the Commission on War Responsibilities was then considered, and the point of view of the German Majority put forward in the following  vague and inconclusive terms, which were,  nevertheless, declared by the Commission to have made the question clear:          The  German proletariat had through the revolution abolished  and  de-     stroyed the old system  which was responsible for the war.        &quot;The German Social&apos;Democracy, however one may judge its policy during     the wrar, has now proved through action  its determined will  to devote all its     forces for the erection of the world ruined through war and to  fight in the     spirit and service of the Internationale, together with the Socialists of all coun-    tries for the realisation of Socialism in the League of Nations.     M. Thomas reiterated the statement that his confidence was not complete in the German Majority, and that the question of responsibility still remained  open.     The speakers at the following morning&apos;s Conference (the 6th  February)  were Kossowsky, the Polish-Jewish representative, Justo, Kurt Eisner, Hermann Miiller, who in reply to Mr.- Ramsay Macdonald said that Germany would  agree to disarm-ment if other  nations did the same, and Mr. Arthur Henderson, who, after speak-ing in general terms on the League of  Nations, proposed the setting up of a  Corn-mission to  supervise the execution of  the resolutions of the Conference, to call ittogether again, whenever the decisions of the Paris Conference rendered  it necessary, to0prepare the agenda for such Conference and to take the necessary steps for theearly reorganisation of the  Internationale.    After Wibaut and Renaudel had concluded the debate on the League of Nations,the discussion on Territorial Questions was entered upon.  The report on the sub-ject was presented by Mistral, the French Majority-that is,  Zimmerwaldian-Socialist,  It declared for the acceptance of the principle of self-determination andfor the decision of disputes by a plebiscite conducted by the authority of the Leagueof Nations, whose authority should be final.   It was asserted by Mistral that theresolution embodied in the  Report had been accepted unanimously, but the Czecho-Slovak delegate, Nemec, declared that  there was a Czecho-Slovak amendment^ and unless this  could be accepted his delegation would not  vote for the original resolu-
tion.   The: Czecho-Slovaks could not approve in  full of  the rejection of historicalclaims. The Austrians&apos; had treated the Slavs in a terrible manner,, and the; AustrianSocial Democrats, who would have, been very severe to the Czecho-Slovaks had Ger-many  won the war, were now trying to use the-Internationale for their own ends.The Czechs were worse off under the new Socialist Government than under the oldregime.     This  challenge was answered by the Austrian delegate, Ellenbogen, who  called for the universal application of the principle of  self-determination.    If  Nemecwanted allies  he must look to Lloyd George and Clemenceau, not to the EnglishSocialists.  The  general strike  in Hungary was a protest against the brutalitiesof the Czech troops.     In the  afternoon, the Swedish delegate, Engberg, proposed an amendment tothe  effect that  where, in some districts!, a. process of  denationalisation by theoppressing nation had taken place, the vote of the population should not necessarilyprevail, but that matters should be regularised by  special measures.     Borgbjerg, the leading Danish delegate, then announced&apos;that the German andDanish delegations had come  to agreement  as to the application of a plebiscite tothe German-Danish frontier districts to be conducted under the League of Nations.     Kautsky appealed for the general application of the plebiscite to Czecho-Slo-slovakia, Alsace-Lorraine, and all disputed  districts.   Historical rights or languagetests would not suffice.     The next  speaker was the Alsatian, Grumbach, who read  a declaration to theeffect  that the Alsatians  were confident that the first elections in Alsace-Lorraineto send Deputies to the  French Parliament would  be a true plebiscite, and wouldbe thoroughly1 in favour of the reattachment of Alsace-Lorraine to France.  In thecourse of  his speech Grumbach attacked the  attitude of the German Majority, andparticularly the declaration of David  and Hermann Wendel,  in regard  to Alsace-Lorraine.  These criticisms were answered by Molkenbuhr.  The remaining speakerswere the  Hungarian  delegate, Buchinger, who  attacked the  Czech  amendment;Tschenkeli  (Georgia),  who  protested against  the establishment of  mandatoryStates for the  control of smaller States,  like Georgia;  Seelig (Austrian), whoasserted the wish of the majority of German-Austrians to Be united with Germany,.and challenged  the  Czech  amendment; Renaudel, Longuet, Mistral, and Locker(Palestine), who claimed the representation of the Jews  in the-League of Nations;and 0&apos;Shannon, the Irish delegate.  The  Report, with Engberg&apos;s amendment, was declared carried unanimously at the end of the session.     14. At  the  Saturday afternoon session  (the 8th February)   the  Conferenceoccupied  itself with  the  Report of the Commission  on  the International LabourCharter, the details of which  are now  familiar, being  in  general based  on theresolutions of the Leeds, 191.6, and Berne, 1917, Conferences.  There was some dis-cussion, and on the following morning the Labour Charter was adopted unanimously.The next  resolution to be adopted was to the effect that the  work of the Confer -ence must be continued in such a way as to permit the greatest influence on the paris  Conference.  With this object in view a Commission was set up to convokethe Conference again  when necessary and prepare the agenda.    A further resolution dealt  with the  question of prisoners of  war,  for whomrapid repatriation was asked.  ; During the discussion on  this Resolution an import-ant speech was made  by Eisner, who declared that it was the  duty of Germans tooffer labour power for the rebuilding of France and Belgium.    The final  session of the Conference dealt with the question of democracy anddictatorship and the  problem  of Russia.  In a debate, in which a  clearly markedgeneral division of opinion first became evident, the principal speakers  were ramsay macdonald, who appealed for unity, the French Majority delegates, Loriot, Longuet,and Mistral, Fritz Adler and the two  Irish  delegates, all .of whom took the pointof view that Bolshevism and dictatorship of the proletariat were principles to befound  in  standard Socialist writings,  and that the special measures  taken by theRussian Bolshevist Government were only forced upon them by counter-revolutionarypropaganda.   In the  end the resolution proposed by Branting, declaring - againstdictatorship by one section of the proletariat only and suggesting  the  sending ofa Commission to Russia to report, was  adopted. .    15. At-the conclusion of the Conference  it was announced  that  the next Inter-national Congress would be probably called together in Berne  during  next August.In the meantime the  Commission would meet when necessary, and the  secretariat       [1130]-482                                                     D
  of the Conference was, at the request of Camilie Huysmans, removed to Amsterdam.  Of the two special  delegations  which were nominated, the first, that to Paris,  to acquaint the Peace Conference with the resolutions of the International Confer-  ence4 carried out its  mission; the second, that to Russia, was prevented from pro-  ceeding by the withholding of passports from certain of the delegates.       16. The first impression gained by a review of the proceedings at Berne  last  February is that the boast of the President  of the Conference, M.  Branting, at its  conclusion, that the foundations of a new Internationale had been  kid,  was a very  hollow one.  It would be truer to  say that the Conference precipitated the establish-  ment of two  Internationales&apos;, the  Zimmerwaldian and  the  &quot; Sozialpatriot,&quot;  and  perhaps a cleavage in  the latter  of  these. What the two factors, the war and the  Bolshevik Revolution, have done for individual Socialist parties, above all the Swiss  and the Italian,^ they have done also to some extent for the Internationale as a whole.  And the indecision which the Berne Conference showed when faced with the problem  of its  attitude to Russia, is a proof of the embarrassment in which  the leaders of  the old Internationale have been placed.   Bolshevism,  in fact, was a crucial test for.  the Conference, and  it failed to pass it.   It may be doubted whether the visit to  Russia of the  delegation would have assisted the Internationale to  clarity in  any  way, for the difficulty is not so much one  of facts as of logic.   The  French delegate,  Loriot, gave expression to this fact in a speech at the conclusion  of the Conference,  and however much non-logical delegates may blink it, it remains for  a considerable  portion of the Internationale.!&quot;      17. The second fact  which emerges from the Berne Conference is that the  dis-  integrating principle of nationalism is present to-day in greater force than before.  It was particularly strong in the German Majority and  the  Czech delegates. Until  the rectification of frontiers  following the  Peace has been  effected and accepted  we shall probably see a lasting  cleavage for  all except those who,  for want  of a  better word, may be called the  vague humanitarian  Socialist  group between the  national Socialists and the non-national.   The  former,  however  fervently, as in  the case of the German Majority, they have embraced and still hold to the doctrines  of Marxism, will deny these doctrines in practice, while the latter will carry them to  their logical conclusion, and subordinate nationality to class warfare.   The probable  outcome of this would seem to be that the first group will as their particular economic  demands for State socialisation are granted  gravitate towards co-operation with, if  not actual  absorption by, the non-Socialist parties, while the  latter will move to the  position of a party which is non-parliamentary on principle.      18. A  heavy loss in prestige by the Russian Bolsheviks might conceivably bring  about  a closing up of  the  rift to which  reference has been  made.   In  this event  the practical re-establishment of the old Internationale would conceivably be effected.  It would then,  there is every reason for asserting,  be  again  largely  under  the  influence of German Social Democracy.   In 1871 the victory of the Germans  had  the effect,  as  Marx prophesied,  of shifting  the  balance  of power  in the  working-  class  movement from France to  Germany.   The  victory of France and her Allies  will  not do the reverse, for the  German  defeat,  though depressing the  prestige of  the bourgeois  parties,  raised that of the Socialists, and it was  not as defeated  Germans so muioh as  triumphant  Social Democrats  that the  German  delegates  appeared at the Berne Conference.   When  the  Conference reassembles in&apos;August  next it will be interesting to  see how the two tendencies have worked  out disintegration-  tegration caused by the Bolshevist Revolution  and the assertion of German  or pro-  German domination caused by the German Revolution of November 1918.    * The Italian Socialist party on the 19th March definitely decided to leave the Internationale Bureauand enter the new Revolutionary Socialist  Internationale on the basis of the principles of the Russiancommunists.    t In this connection it may be of interest to quote Trotsky&apos;s opinion on the Berne Conference, as-contained in a telegram of the 12th March to the Seventh Congress of the Soviets of Turkestan:-       The Berne Conference, which is the outcome of  the growth&apos; of the revolutionary movement    throughout the world, defends the general principle&apos;es of democracy and dictatorship apart from their    class meaning, and has therefore departed from ihe principles laid down in  Marx&apos;s teaching, which    points out that the struggle against the exploiters must inevitably be a class struggle.  Therefore, the    majority of the Berne Conference has joined the reactionary ranks of the &quot; yellow Internationale.&quot;
