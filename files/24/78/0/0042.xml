CATTLE FEEDING STUFFS.

FARM LABOUR.

Unsatisfactory reports regarding the labour situation have ? received from six counties, matters being especially critical in County Donegal and in certain districts of County Kerry.

The ? of work at Limerick bacon factories has also adversely affect? the sale of pigs at fairs and markets over a wide area.



FLAX.

Flax Growing Operations. The sowing of flax is still limited to a few ? districts, and very little of the crop has yet been sown.
