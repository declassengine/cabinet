 THIS DOCUMENT ^JHE^PjSBSfflL^HIS Britannic P/JaJosty^^oyej^niejTt&apos;  Til/() \ ^         -AR  CABIIIET.^i^T^                          ties  for Training^disabled soldiers.Memorandum by the Minister of Pensions.     I do not wish to belittle the question of providing training&apos;for disabled soldiers, but I must not be. taken to assent to a netfigure of.300,000 men as the number for whom the Minister ofLabour will have to provide Training,     I do not believe any accurate or even approximate guess canbe made,     24,000 disabled men have received training or are receivingtraining from the Ministry of Pensions.      The facilities for a variety of reasons have not beenattractive,      High wages during the war, and high unemployment pay sincethe war combined with pensions have made it a pecuniary loss formen to go into training on the scale of allowances paid by theMinistry of Pensions;  nevertheless there has always been awaiting list.      Prospects of unemployment and the higher allowances duringtraining to be paid by the Ministry of &quot;Labour will increase thenumber seeking training/  Moreover, the number of pensioners hasrapidly increased during demobilisation and will increase for afew months more.      The 300,000 mentioned by the Minister of Labour is thepossible oiJ even probable &quot;clientele&quot;; deduction must be made for those incapable of receiving training, ice. the too seriouslydisabled, the older men, the men who will go back to formeremployment,  and the men requiring constant treatment,  The latter will be&apos; trained and treated in convalescent centres under theMinistry of  Pensions, but with all deductions made I should notbe surprised if from. 50,000 to 100,000 men could be attracted ;,
to training given sufficient facilities and - high allowances.L.WORTHIM OK-EVANS.
