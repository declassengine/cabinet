 This Document Is the  Property of                37His 3 &apos;&apos;i  Majs^/o Government..-.n..-.-,,.,vr*..&apos;.i^*   FINANCING OF TRADE 1ITH EASTM EUROPE - ffi*DPJ;IJ:DUJ.i            BY THIS BOARD OP HEADS    An early decision ia desired from the Cabinet on the question of principle whether credits should be afforded under the support of the British Government for the purpose of facilitating British trade with such countries as&apos; PolandP Serbia, Roumania, and the Don State, as distinct from any loans for specific purposes of reconstruction, such as railways.      The present position is that these countries have little or no moans of making payments abroad until they have reestablished their exports.  Consequently moans  of payment must bo temporarily provided by foreign credits, or tie countries in question must drag on without imports until they can again&apos; export: and if necessary imports aro now withheld from them they&apos;ere not likely to be able to create substantial exports for a long time.   British Banking institutions are apparently hot prepared to furnish the necessary oredits, even with the support of the Governments concerned, without some support from the British Government,  and British exporters cannot or dare not give the &apos;c edit themselves.  It appears not unlikely, however, that the United States in particular will do  what is neoessary, and if nothing is dona by this oountry the trade will be lost,  to the United States, for instance, and a great part of it permanently.      $he question &apos;on whioh decision is askea for is as  to whether the British Government is prepared to support approved financial institutions in providing for immediate trade with these territories;  and it is important to distinguish clearly between this sort of help and loans for specific reconstruction purposes.  Measures of recon- struction assist recovery, but have little reference to the general trade that would bo restored be repairing the financial connections severed by the war.     Admittedly, political disturbance would endanger the loans, but it must bo remembered.that if Bolshevism spreadsthe spread will be due more to economic causes * to unom-employment and want - than to any other.   Hie supply of goodsia to a largo ertent a condition precedent to the government being stable.     Tho importance of the trade which ?/ould result to thiscountry should not be underestimated.    1,200,000 per week is expended at present in unemployment pay,  largely for therelief of inci-us tries whose products are required by thecountries in euestion.   In addition, tr^le  connections nowformed will carry a goodwill in future yoars that will be most valuable in view of the increasing intensity of foreigncompetition in neutral i^^k^-
     The banks and other institutions have been soundedas to whether they would be willing to undertake the financing of trade with these countries.    They are definitely unwilling to do so without Government support.though they have expressed their belief in the heed loraction and their willingness to co-operate if Governmenthelp is forthcoming.   Their position is reasonablyexpressed in the statement-made by one of them that itis proper to ask them to undertake full normal commercialrisks but not the abnormal risks due to a precedingstate of war.   Such a discrimination is reasonable andthe principle has already been accepted by the Governmentin the case of war risks insurance.   It is thereforeclear that G-overnment intervention is necessary if thesituation is to be properly met.   Moreover the precedent of the war risks insurance goes to shew that, withprudent management, the Government may not lose by the transaction.   Not only so but a limit may be set to theamount risktoin each instance, the limit being capableof extension as circumstances warrant.     The precise form which support would take woulddiffer in different countries according to the localconditions.   In SX Russia it will be best to worklargely through the co-operative societies.   In roumania and Serbia it may be best to work through the Governments.In each case, however, a suitable scheme has be-en or canbe found to meet the needs of the case.     It may be worth while in coming  to a decision to distinguish between the countries whose products are largely complementary to ours and needed  in thia countryand those whose products are largely  competing;  but itmust he remembered  that just as Germany, though a com-petitor, was also one of our most valuable markets so a valuable export trade to countries of the latter class iapossible, payment being made eventually through the tra&amp;Ghills resulting from their exports to other countries.     Lastly  it may he urged  that each week^ delaymeans loss both to  the countries in question and TO theUnited Kingdom.     A decision therefore  is urgently desired,  on thegeneral principle.A..0,  (SOTS.    15.4.19.
