H.M.S. ^Shakespeare&quot; is  at Reval,  and reports  that heavy Bolshevik attacks are being made on the  Esthoman  front          The Esthanian C-in-C, proposes certain naval operations against Cronstadt in connection with an advance along the coast towards Petrograd, and is anxious to strike beforethe Bolsheviks attack Reval from the sea.  The Esthonians askfor the assistance of British monitors and aircraft, hut theSoN.O., has been informed that there is no intention at  thepresent time of co-operating in offensive action with theJsthonians. nor of sending monitors;, aircraft or 0,MeB!s to the Baltic.  Approval has &quot;been given, however, for Caledon&apos;saeroplane to he transferred to the Esthonian Government.          The situation at Lihau appears  to he slightly improved.The Germans have heon ordered to re-establish the former LettishGovernment, and  to return arms  to Lettish troops disarmed, butup to  the 27th  instant no step had heen  taken by the Germans tocarry  out this  order, and meanwhile  the  Baits with the assistanceof some pro-German Letts have formed  a Cabinet.          The  S.N.O., Baltic, is of opinion that until a more satisfactory situation arises at Lihau and the Lettish Govern-ment is re-established, no  supplies  either for Latvia or forthe German  forces operating in Latvia should be  landed at Libau.          S.N.O., Baltic, has been  ordered^ if he considers  it practicable  to  leave Libau  in itls present state,  to make a  shortvisit  to Helsingfors,as  it is  thought  that the  presence  of  aBritish Squadron would have a good moral effect  on  the finnish government.                      MITE  SBL          Weather conditions are improving and an early Springis expected.  The mouth of the White Sea is stated to beunusually clear this year so that our reinforcements should notbe hindered.          As soon as the River Dwina is clear of ice-, attack by enemy ships may be expected, but our flotilla is ready at archangel to engage them.                       ADRIATIC.          The Admirals&apos; Committee has concluded its enouiry atCattaro. and returned to Venice where it is likely to remain. Diamond&quot; has been ordered home and Admiral Kiddle will resideat a hotel, and will fly his flag in a destroyer.  He statesthat no meeting of the Naval Committee for-the Adriatic hastaken place since 11th April and that the Italian Delegate hasmtormed him that he does not propose to hold another meetingunless fresh points arise.  Under&quot; these circumstances AdmiralKiddle considers the continuance of the Committee to be of doubtful value.The
2r pe) 0          The Italian Government,  through its delegate,  stilldenies the right of the Committee  to authorise requisitions and claims the sole right to deal with all ships under 200 tons.These points are being taken up direct with the Governmentsconcerned.Italian policy in the Adriatic is aimed at securingentire control over ex Austrian merchant ships9 large and small,including the small sailing craft, and to keep,the EasternAdriatic&apos;trade in Italian hands, to the exclusion of the French          Rear Admiral Niblack, U.Sd., having been appointedDirector of  Naval Intelligence at Washington, has been relievddon  the Admirals&apos; Committee by Rear Admiral Andrews,          The U.S. delegate is reporting favourably on therequest of ex Austrian Naval Officers  to become American citizen-zens, and loin  the American Mercantile Marine.          At Cattaro, where  the French Rear Admiral is incharge of the ex Hungarian ships, the  ex Hungarian Naval Officersand men have endeavoured to  secure recognition os belonging to the jugo-Slav Navy.  The French  Senior Naval Officer has not altogether discountenanced these proceedings  and tho Italiandelegated efforts have been directed  to treating  these officers  and men as  enemy subjects.   The French  Senior naval officer has  now agreed  that  these Officers and men and the dockyard  should be under his direct control  and  that Jugo-Slavdistinguishing  marks should  not be worn  on  the Austrian uniformSo                          MEDITERRANEAN.          The  Italian Government  has  formally notified  theestablishment  of a Naval  Station  in  the  Dodecanese,  with  juris-diction  over the shores of  the  Dodecanese  Islands,  and  the  asia minor Coast  from  the Gulf of Scalanova,  South of Smyrna  as  faras  Adalia,  and beyond-the command to  comprise all  vesselsoperating in these waters,  as  well  as all  Naval  Shore Establish-ments.   &quot;The Naval Forces consist of,,the battleship  &quot;ReginaElena&quot;  (Broad Pendant)&apos;   the  cruiser  Piemonte&quot;,  two  smalldestroyers,  three  trawlers  and threenrequisitioned merchantvessels.,           The  Naval  Bases at Famagusta,  Beirut and Tripolihave been closed,                       BIAGK m AND DANUBE.           S.S.  &quot;Bermudian&quot;  sailed from Constantinople for Malta on the  21st April  ?dth 662  Russian refugees and s.s. &quot;PrincessEnaM will arrive  at  Malta about the end of April with 100British refugees.           The Russian Volunteers who were evacuated from Odessa to^Akkerman, numbering 5,170,  have now been withdrawn to Tulcea, and of these 2,000 are being sent in lighters to Sulina whence they will be shipped to Novorossisk.           At Sevastopol, the armistice with the Bolsheviks which was in force up to 26th instant has now been extended to the night of 29th April.  The town was reported to be quiet and orderly on  the 26th.   The British C-in-C, Mediterranean, arrived a  Sevastopol in &quot;Iron Duke&quot; on the 24th and in response to his offer of assistance, Admiral Amet has asked for one&apos;net layer two trawlers,  10 motor launches, and 18,000 metres of net.   &apos; These requirements will all be met.    . lm    H.M. Ships &quot;Emperor of India&quot;, &quot;Calypso&quot;, &quot;Stuart&quot; and &quot;Montrose&quot; are also at Sevastopol.           There has been a serious outbreak of mutiny in theFrench ships in the Black Sea.where Admiral Amet appears to have                                                          shown,
shown great weakness in his handling of the situation.   Themutiny followed, if it was not the direct effect of,  AdmiralAmetfs dealings with the Bolshevists and it quickly spread toall ships, the crews refusing to fight the Bolshevists,demanding to he sent home, and declining to do any work  untilthe date&apos; of sailing was fixed.          The French Suuadron is under i&amp;n orders to leaveSevastopol on 30th by which time it is hoped that the evacuationwill have been completed..  It is expected that the Bolshevikleaders will give Admiral Amet a signed agreement to the effectthat, in case the evacuation is comoleted by noon on the 30thApril no hostile enterprise will be&quot;undertaken by them againstthe Allies on the sea, and that no effort will be made  to com-plete and commission the submarines under construction  atNikolaev.     British Naval Officers have not in any wayassociated themselves with these negotiations, and Admiral Cal-thorpe has already taken steps to destroy units of the  Russianfleet remaining at Sevastopol,  All submarines have been taken out of the harbour and sunk in deep water, as well as about,000 mine pistols.  Steps are also being taken to render uselessxsi by explosion all cylinders of battleships and cruisers, and destroyers and  torpedo craft are to be systematically damaged.The Bolsheviks have been advised of this action through AdmiralAmet  and that we propose  to remove any or all of the mines andminelayers now  in the port.  The magazines in which the minesare stored are however difficult of access.          Bolshevik forces are advancing against Kertch whichis held by Russian Volunteers.  British cruisers, destroyers,and monitors  are operating in  the flank, and  the Bolsheviksthreaten reprisals on British  and Allied subjects at Theodosiaunless  this action ceases  forthwith.   H.M.S.  &quot;Centaur&quot; has beensent  to Theodosia for  their protection.          The  six M.L!s  asked  for by Admiral  Troubridge havebeen  despatched Ibo Belgrade.          The  &quot;Ak Deniz&quot;  will  be ready to  sail  from Hamburg onthe 4th May with Turkish subjects on board for  repatriation.                          CASPIAN.                                                   at long range          It is reported that HIE, &quot;Asia&quot; was in action/ih thenorth part of the Caspian on 19th instant, with two enemy destroyers, which after dropping mines withdrew towardsAstrakhan.   Astrakhan has been bombed.  &quot;Zoroaster&quot; is atChechen Island to protect our aeroplane base.          It is reported that the Bolsheviks have sent three submarines from Bikolaev to Alexandrovsk probably for the caspian.  These must be the three Holland&apos;American type still incases, and which would take 6 months 6f good work to assemble.The depth of water in the River at Alexandrovsk at the springfloods is only 6 feet, and it is certain that no railway couldcarry any assembled submarine of the types available at Nikolaevowing to their weight.

The delay in surrendering submarineengines is due to the fact that the s,s. &quot;Adeline Hugo Stinnes&quot;- the only available vessel which is suitable for their con-veyance from Germany - has been detained at the Tyne.

Her  passage   through  the  Canal was insisted upon,  and she  /as  eventually passed  through,  but Admiral Goette  claims that the  Gorman Government was not  bound and must  decline  to afford facilities in their harbours  or  the use  of their waterways to Allied  vessels  engaged upon  Blockade  duty,  (texmm Ifercfiiitilfl  Maxim (Food Ships)            5 additional  German ships have been handed  over  during  the week, and the  numbers which have  now arrived in British  Territorial waters are  :-                   For British......  106 out of 22V                   For Fronnh.......   30 out of  32                   For U..S.A........  __.il out of JZ                                     m        m          m The Sub-Commission in H.M.S. &quot;Coventry&quot; left Hamburg  for Harwich on the 20th instant and return to Germany  on the  26th  April.0  4-v  vn   i  ?her? has  been no change  in the situation as regards  the blockade since last week tyt the Senior Naval Officer  in the  uaitio has been directed to report  immediately he considers  any                                                      relaxation..,.

The work oi&quot; disarming sun ace vessels ana xne aesuruovionof Submarines, in compliance&quot;with the terms of the Armistice,is proceeding satisfactorily, and little progress is beingmade in new construction.  the submarines which were under con-instruction are in most cases being wholly broken up for scrap,but in some cases the mid-ship sections are being converted intooil or water tanks.  The coal shortage is impeding bothconstruction and dismantling.  During the latter nart of the-far a large part oi the various shipyards has been employed on freight steamers, and after a few months of peace a considerablenumber of new Mercantile Vessels will be at sea and trading.          The general tone of Officers. and officials who con-ducted the Inspecting Officers was more self-reliant than on previous inspections,&apos; and at Kiel, v/hich is always different toother ports,  the general atmosphere v/as decidedly more truculent,Certain of the educated clasoss appear to be relying on the  idea that Germany  can embarrass the Allies by a refusal lb accept the Peace Terms.          At  Wilhelmshaven there appears to be a distincfimprovement in discipline.  Crews of ships, though dirty, were well behaved, and Petty Officers and young sailors were&apos;betterturned out than heretofore.  The Officers, however, still fearthe men.          The majority of the Ports visited have smallpopulations and are situated in agricultural districts in whichfood, though  not plentiful, has never been really short.  the exceptions^are Bremen, Hamburg, etc and as regards  these tmvnsit is difficult to make any dogmatic statemenfas to whether ornot the populace looks healthy.  Speaking generally, the peoplelook sallow and tired but this may be due to the moral effect ofdefeat  hopelessness of outlook and nerves, as well as a lackof really nourishing food.          The inhabitants of Heligoland appeared overjoyed  tomeet the members of the Sub-Commission, it having apparently been rumoured that they had come  to  take over the Island.   On^11^old tliat this was not tne case tlie inhabitants statedthat they hoped that their desire to come again under british rule would be conveyed to the Government.   &quot;                       DUTCH F, A RT TNDTT3T          The question of manning the surrendered german merchant vessels, hitherto war-bound in the Netherlands east indies&apos; ports  continues to cause difficulty, particularly  inconnection with the disposal of their German crews, who have                                                     already ....relaxation is necessary and to specify what form such relaxation-tion should take.                            ,  u    oD,-,  .
