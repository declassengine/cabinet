 r !lj?yjimfi!ft   the Property of         lkw\ *g          WAR  CABINET.PROVISION OP FACILITIES  FOB TRAITOgwmommmu BY THE MINISTER OF MOUR.      Theprovision of facilities for training disabled soldiers $3 a  very  formidable problem, and  is causing great anxiety to tfte Training  Department  of  the Ministry of Labour.   The number of men who will  require training can only be guessed at.   The Minister of Pensions puts the figure as  high as 300.000.   Whatever be the number  it is  clearly an obligation whisk the country must meet.  I find  that there ie no question  which so excites the sympathy ef the populace, nor any,  where neglect causes more irritation and disturbance.      The  National factories obviously afford the best training est&amp;b-   lishments.   For the  Government to erect speei&amp;l factories for the purpose would involve great delay end still greater expense.  The Ministry  ef labour is accordingly relying upon the National Factories being put  at  its disposal for thio purpose.   on the other hand, where factories are saleable the district loses an opportunity of increased  employment.   I am, however, of opinion that it is more^urgent  and important to provide training facilities for disabled^soldiers  than even to increase  the number of working factories. There is  no part of  the community to-day where extreme propaganda achieves  so muoh success as amongst disabled soldiers who are disappointed.      I  would  venture to suggest accordingly that the principle should  be laid down  that the provision of training facilities for disabled  soldiers should be regarded as having first claim oil National  Factories which are suitable for the purpose.   It iuust at the same  time, of course, be recognised that where a factory is saleable  and  another for which  no purchaser san he found can he rendered  reasobably  suitable, the Training Department must accommodate Itself in the latter.      In immediate instance arises for decision upon which these principles can be determined in the case of a factory at Garrison lane, Birmingham.    The Birmingham district has a large number of disabled  soldiers, and  Birmingham itself is a very convenient centre in which  to give training.   The Leoal Committee, whioh, a few months  ago was on the verge of  breaking up because of what it regard&apos; ed as Government neglect, considers this faotory to he indispensable to their  training scheme.   The Minister of supply, however, has a purchaser in  view who is believed to be willing to pay more for the faotory that  it cost, while it  in anticipated that the machinery would fetch its value.   The priee for whioh the faotory can be sold  is believed to  be  in the neighbourhood of  30,000*   There is no other  factory available in the neighbourhood nearer than Dudley, Dudley, however, is  very inconveniently situated in relation to the bulk  of the men who  would require training, and the factory is perched in on inaccessible position on the top of a hill.      The  question for decision  is whether the Garrison Dane faotory should  be handed over tc the Training Department of the Ministry of Labour.    I strongly urge that  it should.   I regret to say that in the Midlands  the Governments good faith in the matter of providing for disabled  soldiers is regarded as being at stake, and it is necessary to  demonstrate that effective action is really intended to be taken.
