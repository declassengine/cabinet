f&quot;this Document is  the  Property of His Britannic N\j.^j:rs Commentfb.T7^D^IpBILiSATION  OF  MINISTRY  OF   FOOD.MEMORANDUM   BY   FOOD  CONTROLLER.       1 circulate for the consideration of the War  Cabinet a  Memorandum as to  the   demobilisation of  the Ministry of Food.       It will be seen that a very large relaxation of food control has already been effected..   Rationing will practically disappear by May 3rd (when the present ration books expire);   tea, bacon, lard, margarine, dried fruits, certain  cereals,  oilseeds,  oils  and  fats, and   many other articles have  been freed from control completely; import and export restric-   tions  have been abandoned or relaxed in the majority of cases; extraction  of  flour  has   been  restored to a pre-war level; restrictions on  the use of cereals have been reduced to   a minimum; and the abundance  of feeding stuffs  has allowed  a  complete abandonment   of all rationing of animals.       The staff of the Ministry,  which at the date of the armistice was not far short of 9,000,   had fallen by the 1st April to just under 6,000.   Very large reductions  have been  made   also in the staffs of the Food Committees, which  are not included in the foregoing figures.       On or before June 30th a number of fresh relaxations will be introduced, of  which   the most important will be the disappearance of such, remnants of rationing as still remain,   carrying with ite practically all the work of the Food Committees, the freeing of imported   meat, the final decontrol of oats, barley and maize, the freeing of home produced cheese   and the relaxation of the cheese distribution scheme.       On September 30th home-grown meat will be freed from  control,  and the summer   milk prices will come to an end.       The work remaining to be  done thereafter  will, I think,  not be sufficient  lo justify   the maintenance of a separate Government Department with a full minister  at  its  head.   There will, however, still remain three classes of questions for further consideration:         (A) Remnants of administrative work not completed by September  30f/e       Of these the  most important will be the control of the flour mills  (which  may oou-   tinue till  March  31st, 1920, or later); the winding-up  of the  Sugar  Commission   (probably at December 31st, 1919); the control  and  distribution of imported butter   (which is likely to be in short supply till the spring of  1920);  and the liquidation of   stocks of cheese,  tea,  rice,  etc.       If the Ministry of Food is formally continued  in existence till December 31st, prac-   tically all these remnants of work can be completed without transfer to another depart-   ment, with the exception  of the  flour mills control,  which could continue under the Wheat   Commission.   If it is decided  to terminate the separate existence of the Ministry before   December 31st, responsibility for finishing the administrative work  will  presumably be   taken by the Ministry of  Supply    (B) Completion of Accounts and  Winding-up of Financial Transactions  generally.       This  will probably  be  a  matter of two or three years work, if not more. Probably   the most convenient course will be for  the Ministry of  Supply  to be made responsible   for the purely financial  work  as   well as for  the administrative remnants  described   above.                      (C)  Permanent Measures of Control.       The Memorandum indicates a  number of measures of control as to which it is recom-   mended  that they should be recognised as permanent.  In respect of these measures,   two  alternative courses  are  possible;  one, that  they should be distributed  among  a   number of permanent departments; the other,  that some one  permanent department   should be  generally  responsible  for  dealing with food questions as a whole, possibly   with a special Parliamentary  Secretary for the purpose.    6240.

1   t &apos;   *      If the former course is  adopted, the permanent measures  of control  might pro-  bubly be  most conveniently distributed  as follows :          Milk  Control Ministry of Health. A separate memorandum as to this is being      submitted to the War Cabinet.          Liquor  Control. A  Memorandum dated March 27th  has already been eireu-      lated.          National Kitchens.-Ministry of Health.          Farina Mills. Board of Agriculture.          Investigation and Record of Prices. Board of Trade.          Provisions   for  protection  of  consumers (including possibly fixing of prices      and  licensing of retailers). Board of Trade.          Certain  Statistical returns  . Board of Trade or Board of Agriculture.          Documents and Records.-Board of Trade or Ministry of Supply.      If the latter course&apos; is adopted, all the above measures, with the single exception of liquor  control, would go  to a  single department,  which should  presumably  be cither the Board of Trade or the Ministry  of Supply.  The decision as to which of  these departments it should be is a matter on which  I do not  feel competent to  express any opinion.      In this  connection,  I should call attention  to the  arguments that are  being ad- vanoed in various quarters  in favour  of the   maintenance  of  some   department specially  concerned  with food matters and particularly responsible  for the protection of the consumer.  Resolutions in  favour of  the  continuance of  the  Ministry of  Food have been passed by the National Executive of  the Labour Party and by  the  Central. Board of  the  Co-operative Union.  The same  view  has also   been  strongly  urged upon me  by the  Consumers&apos;  Council.  I give in  an  appendix a  speech  made  by Sir T. W. Allen, Deputy-Chairman of the Council,  and endorsed by them.  I give also a copy of the resolutions  referred to above.      The  choice between the two  alternatives  raises  a question of  general  policy, upon which  I  express no opinion.   I desire,  however, to point out that experience has shown that in order to be effective, food control must be far-reaching.   The  mere fixing of prices without control of  supply and, ultimately, of  distribution,  often defeats  its own  object.  Unless, therefore, the Government and the country  are prepared  for the continuance  of an extensive system of regulation,  it would probably be better to  with- draw control altogether, and to adopt the first of the  alternatives  set  out above  of dis- tributing  amongst the different departments  named the various  separate items  of per- manent control.     I ask, therefore,  for an early decision of the Cabinet-     (1) as to whether the policy indicated of demobilising  the  Ministry of Food  should         be  carried  out, and  as to the most suitable date  tu aim at for  the termination         of the Ministry;     (2) as to whether any single department should be given continuing responsibility         for food questions generally, and, if so, what department?     (o) If the  alternative of splitting.up  the permanent measures of  control  is  pre-         ferred, as to which departments should undertake the various  items, and also         as to  the department which  should  become responsible  for  winding  up  the         financial  transactions.     I should add that Mr. Clynes, on behalf of the Labour Party, wishes to raise, at anearly date, in Parliament, the question of  the continuance of the  Ministry of Food.  Itwill clearly be  desirable, if possible, that  my Memorandum should have been consideredby the Cabinet  and some provisional conclusion reached before this debate takes place.     MINISTRY OF FOOD,                                      G.  H.   ROBERTS         1st  May, 1919.
I32:DEMOBILISATION  OF  THE  MINISTRY  OF   FOOD.     i. The Memorandum  deals with the demobilisation  of the  Ministry of  Food under three headings :-     I. Relaxations of food control up to 3rd May, 1919 (being the end of the period           for which the current ration  books were issued).    II. Prospective relaxation of control after 3rd May.   III. Arrangements to be made on the dissolution of the Ministry of Food.     For the purpose of convenience the date for the formal abolition of the Ministry of Food is assumed as 31st December,  1919.  An earlier date could be arranged and would involve  merely the transfer of a larger amount of transitional administrative work to other  Departments.                  I.  RELAXATIONS  UP  TO   3rd  MAY.     2. The following are the principal  relaxations effected in the rationing and regis- tration system since November  nth. As regards Meat, retailers have been permitted since December 1st to  sell  edible offals including tongue, kidney,  and skirt, free  of: the coupon.  In addition to some concessions made during the Christmas period, the value of  the meat coupon was increased from 4d. to  5d.  on  December 29th, pork,. poultry, game, hares, rabbits, horseflesh and canned  meats being  at  the same time freed from all  rationing restrictions. Since  February 9th, Catering  Establishments- have been permitted to supply meat meals without coupons.     The  ration of Duller  and Margarine was increased  from 5  ozs. to 6  ozs. on- January 12th.   The rationing restrictions on margarine were removed partly on Feb- ruary 16th and completely  on March 2nd. The butter ration  was at  the same time- fixed at 1 oz.,  but will  be increased to 2 ozs. on  May  5th.     Lard was released from the coupon, i.e., was made purchasable without coupons and  without restriction as to quantity on December 15th.   Registration of customers- for lard was abolished on March 31st.     In addition to some concessions at Christmas, the Sugar ration was raised fromi 8 ozs. to  12 ozs.  on January  26th.     Coupons are now required only for butchers meat,  sugar  and butter; but  con-cessions have been introduced at various  dates since the Armistice by which in all thesecases retailers  may sell to their registered customers any surplus quantities available.over and  above the  ration.  Jam and  marmalade were released  from all rationing&quot;restrictions on April 16th.     It has also been possible, owing to the increased supplies of rationed foods avail-able, to&apos; effect a considerable saving  of expenditure  by the abolition of the  arrange-ments for checking coupon sales by retailers.     3. A  number of reductions in price have also been  made.  Margarine was re-- duced by  2d. a lb. as early as November 17th, and has since been decontrolled.  Meat,.both home produced and imported,  was reduced  by  2d. a lb. on March 3rd.  Cheesewas  reduced by 2d. a lb.  on March  19th.  Condensed milk has  been reduced by ifd.a tin (December 9th), dried fruits by 2d. to 4d.  a lb. (February  17th),  and canned,salmon by 4d.  to jd. a  tin (March 20th).     In the case of meat, the Ministry of Food were materially assisted by the decision.of the Inter-Departmental Committee on the Reduction of Prices, under which H.M.. Treasury have undertaken liability for losses involved  in the reduction in price which took place on March 3rd, and also in the  prospective reduction of 2d. a lb. on imported&apos;meat on May 5th.     Other reductions have also taken place, e.g., tea is now being sold at between 4d-and  6d. a lb. less than the  former controlled price of 2s. 8d.;  margarine is, for thepresent at any rate, being sold at 9d. a lb. instead of the former price of is.; the price-of eggs has been.reduced by about  ijd., and there have also been some reductions in the prices of cereal products and fresh fruit.621!.

     4.  Bread of pre-war quality was restored on December  i6th, when the  average rate of extraction required from wheat was reduced to 76 per cent.  During- the time of greatest stringency the percentage required was 91 per cent.  Taking into account the quality  of  wheat at  present supplied to millers, the present percentage is  as low as would be adopted with control removed.     Among other relaxations to  the  consumer may be  quoted the removal  of restric- tions on sugar confectionery and cake and pastry (December  /th),  the  sale of sweet- meats (March  1st) and  ice cream  (March  22nd),  the  sale  of milk  as a beverage (March  15th),  the supply of sugar for beverages  (March 24th), and  the use and sale of cream (April 12th).     5. A considerable number of relaxations  have already been made  to  the trade. Freedom of  supplies  and distribution  has  been restored in the  case of  margarine (March  2nd), most kinds  of fish (March 3rd),  tea (March 24th), bacon, lard, cocoa and dried fruits (March 31st).  Importation is now controlled by the Ministry  only  in  thecase of  wheat, flour, maize,  oats,  butter, cheese,  and sugar.     Maximum prices have been removed or formally suspended in  the  case of,  e.g., maize products, beans, peas and pulse, canned  meats, certain kinds  of fish, eggs, cocoa butter, certain  kinds of fruit  and vegetables and cattle feeding stuffs; but are still neces- sarily maintained in the case of a large number of commodities.  Maximum prices will be removed in  every case as soon as they are above the actual current market price. H.M. Treasury have agreed that  in order to effect decontrol in this respect as early as possible, stocks held by the  Ministry shall, where necessary, be sold at a loss.     6. The development of trade has further been encouraged by the release of raw materials to manufacturers,  e.g., the quantity of sugar supplied to manufacturers  hasbeen quadrupled  and low  grade sugar  has  been entirely  freed  (February  24th); restrictions on the distribution of oils and fats, margarine and compound  lard have been removed (February  17th  and  March 8th).     7. Numerous relaxations  have  been made in the import and export prohibitions in force before the cessation of hostilities.   Unrestricted importation is now permitted in the  ease of certain  cereals, bacon, hams,  lard, tea,  coffee,  raw  cocoa, fresh fruit, canned  and preserved fruit, vegetables in  brine, unsweetened aerated and  mineral waters,  etc. Further,  a general licence  has recently been issued by the Board of Trade permitting  the  unrestricted  importation  (except  as  regards spirits other than brandy and rum) of goods produced  in and  exported from any part of the British Empire.     The Ministry are in consultation with the Department of Import Restrictions with a view to the  restrictions  being removed in the case of a number of other commodities. The only commodities importation  of which the Ministry of  Food still think it neces- sary to restrict are cheese, butter, canned salmon,  certain varieties of fish, sugar, and beer.     8.  The principal  foodstuffs  in the  case   of which export prohibitions have now been removed are canned and potted fish (except  salmon), dried eggs, honey, tinned and potted meats, coffee essence, wines, condensed milk,  milk powder,  aerated  and mineral waters, saccharine,  syrup,  biscuits, cakes, oatmeal, cornflour and certain other cereal products,  and  all spirits  except whisky, etc.   Limited export  facilities  are also permitted in the case of cocoa butter, raw cocoa, dates, tea, coffee, bacon and  lard, confectionery, lemons, margarine and compound lard, etc., etc. Further, the quantity of beer and ale which may be exported has recently been increased from one-third to two-thirds  of  pre-war exports.     Export prohibitions  are  still maintained in the  case  of  cereals except for  seed purposes, feeding stuffs, butter, cheese, sugar, eggs,  meat and poultry, certain fruits, oils and fats, and oleaginous kernels and seeds.     9.  Three important changes have  been made affecting farmers:      (a) The Pig Sales Order, by which pigs for slaughter were sent to a market, where they were  sold to a Government buyer  for allocation  to bacon curers, pork butchers, manufacturers, etc., with a view to limiting prices and  ensuring equitable distribution, etc., was withdrawn on December 29th, and replaced by an Order  prescribing maxi- mum prices only.
      (b) Cereals restriction orders have been revoked in so far as they affect the  use  of barley,  rye  and oatmeal.      (c) Owing to increased  tonnage, it has  also been possible for the feeding stuffs.  rationing system, which  was in  force at the  end of last year, to be relaxed.   Since  January 25th, the only machinery necessary  has been  the issue of priority certificates  in exceptional cases.  Control over the distribution  of feeding stuffs ceased entirely  on April 27th.                                                               .   &apos; II. PROSPECTIVE RELAXATIONS OF FOOD CONTROL AFTER 3rd  MAY.     10. The present Ration Books come to an end on May 3rd.  No fresh books will be issued and no coupons will be required for the purchase of any kind of food after that date. - Until June  30th, however, customers will still be tied to their retailers for meat, sugar  and butter, although a  freer exchange of retailer will  be allowed than has hitherto been the case.   It. will  also  be optional  for retailers to require registered customers  to produce their expired  Ration Books for marking when purchases are made in order to prevent any customer from being  served  twice.  After June 30th it is proposed to abolish all rationing and registration of customers. As is pointed out, however, below, it will still be necessary for  a time to control distribution  to retailers so far as meat, butter  and sugar are  concerned.     11. Meat. Imported meat will be freed from  control on June 30th; that is to say, after that date butchers will be able to obtain any  quantity from any  source.   Maxi- mum prices will, however, be  maintained at  least till September 30th.     Control of home-produced  meat,  i.e., the present system of grading, fixing prices and distribution of supplies to the butchers, will be necessary until September 30th, up to which date prices have been guaranteed.   Meat of all kinds will then be  completely freed.     As regards canned meat, the Ministry&apos;s stocks will be liquidated by June 30th.     Bacon. Control of imports and  distribution has already been removed.  It  is expected that the stocks held  by the Ministry will be liquidated, prices freed and com- plete decontrol effected by June 30th, but this is  subject to  the course  of prices  in America, which are  giving cause for some anxiety.     12. Milk. I am submitting  to the Cabinet: a separate memorandum on the future of milk control.     Summer prices have been fixed with effect to September 30th.  The Order con- trolline wholesale dealers under Defence of  the  Realm  Regulations  2GG has been revoked; but it has been stated  specifically  that this revocation is without prejudice to any action towards the permanent control of  the wholesale trade in milk that may be decided upon.  The  Order compelling the registration of dealers is being retained.     Condensed Milk. Distribution will be  freed  on May 31st,  and the Ministry&apos;3 stocks will have been disposed of by about the same date.  Control of prices should be relinquished shortly  afterwards.     Butler. Owing to  the shortage  of supplies,  it will probably  be necessary for organised distribution to the trade to be  continued until the spring of 1920.    Cheese. Substantial imports are  in sight, and it is expected that the  distribution scheme  will be discontinued during  the  summer.  The Ministry have however made contracts for Australian and New Zealand cheese up to the summer of  1920, and itwill therefore be necessary to retain a measure of control until  that time.     13. Tea. The stocks of the  Ministry  are being disposed of gradually (in con- junction with private imports), and will be liquidated  by December  31st.   Some re- striction on exports  may also be required until December 31st.    Coffee-Restrictions on  prices have been removed,  but in this case  also somecontrol  over  exports may be necessary until December 31st.    Cocoa is controlled only  as regards prices and exports.  It is  expected that these controls will be removed by May 31st and  June 30th respectively.    Dried Fruits. The Ministry^  stocks will  be liquidated  at  ah  early date,  butprice restrictions may be  required until  August 31st.    6241   &apos;                                                                *
     14.  Jam. Control of prices must be maintained until the prospects of the coming fruit season can be foreseen; it should  be possible  for  it to be  withdrawn  about June 30TH.     Potatoes. The 1919/ crop will  not  be controlled  in  any way.   The work in - -connection with the 1918 crop should be  completed by  July 31ST.     Onions. The Order fixing maximum prices for onions will be withdrawn about May 31ST.     Poultry, Game and Rabbits. The only restriction in force is that of price, which will be removed by June 30TH.     Fish. The remaining price  restrictions will be removed  within a  few months. Distribution will be entirely freed at the same time.     Canned Salmon. The Ministry  have purchased large  supplies in  the  United States and  Canada, and  it will probably  be necessary for control both of prices  and distribution to be maintained until the arrival of the  1919 pack  (say October 31ST); since the supplies held by the Ministry represent about one-third of the normal amount of canned salmon sold in the country  in the years  immediately preceding the war.     15.  Cattle Feeding  Stuffs. Control of cattle feeding stuffs has  been removed and the Ministry&apos;s stocks have been  liquidated.     16.  Wheat and Wheat en Flour. It  will be necessary  for control  of importation to be retained until world&apos;s  prices, tonnage and finance enable private enterprise to maintain  adequate  supplies at a price sufficiently low to produce  the quartern loaf at 9d. or less.   Moreover control cannot be  relinquished without the assent of the Allied Governments  represented on the  Inter-Allied Wheat Executive; but  it is  expected that it will be possible for it to take place in the autumn.  Decontrol of the flour mills requires six  months&apos; notice, and it is hoped that it may take place before the end of the year.     Barley. Restrictions on the importation of Californian, Oregon, Washington  and Chilian barleys  have already been removed.  It is proposed to decontrol the remain- ing varieties by about April 30TH.  There  are no  Inter-Allied  obligations  in this case.     Oats. Immediate decontrol is made impossible owing to our obligations to Allied Governments and to the War Office.  It should probably take place not later than June 30TH.     Maize. Inter-Allied obligations  make retention of  control  necessary for  the present.   The situation is further complicated by  difficulties  of tonnage  and finance, and also of  labour, in the Argentine.   It may be provisionally  stated that decontrol will be  possible by June  30TH.     17. Sugar. Control  over sugar must be retained for the present.  The wholesale price at which sugar is now being sold in  this country is appreciably below.the price at which it would stand on imports purchased to-day in the producing markets. It isexpected that it will be necessary for the Sugar Commission to continue to safeguardsupplies and distribution over the next harvest.   Its&apos; dissolution should be possible by December 31ST.     Organised distribution of supplies to  retailers will be required until probably  the end of November.     18. Food Control Committees have  already made large reductions in their staffs. As a result of the measures set out above,  nearly all their work will  have ceased by June 30TH.  It is further proposed to arrange with  the Secretary of State for Home Affairs that  after the same date the  enforcement of the Food Controllers Orders shall rest with the police and not with Food Control Committees.  Probably, therefore,  the whole of  the staff,  with the exception of  the Executive  Officer or Secretary,  can in most cases be.dispensed with at the end  of July or shortly afterwards..     It is  considered that  the  Committees  themselves should continue in existence until September 30TH or  the natural expiry of their term  of office- (November  18TH), in order to dispose of such work as remains to  be  dealt with, and  also in case of any emergency arising.  They would, however, at the most only have a nucleus staff after the end of June, and it is probable that in most cases  only the part-time service of the Executive Officer or Secretary would be required.
    19. The following are comparative figures,  showing the number of the head-quarters and provincial staff of the Ministry of Food on  November  nth and May ist *last respectively : .

As in the case of the Food Control Committees, a very large proportion ofthe work now being done by the Ministry of Food will  not be continued  after June30th.   As regards the provincial staff of the Ministry, the staff of the Divisional FoodCommissioners will practically disappear by the end of June, but the work of the LiveStock  Commissioners must continue on its present lines until September  30th, whencontrol of home-killed meat comes to an end.  As  regards staff at  headquarters, afurther large reduction and a corresponding contraction in the organisation of the De-partment will be effected by June 30th; the  numbers will be  continuously reducedduring the following  months, and the Department could be  wound  up at any time after September  30th, subject to the necessary steps being taken for the  transfer toother Government Departments of those of its functions still being exercised. Recom-mendations as to the  action to be taken  in this respect are contained in the following paragraphs.III. ARRANGEMENTS  TO  BE  MADE  ON  DISSOLUTION  OF  MINISTRY                                 OF  FOOD.    21. The work to  be  done by the  Ministry of Food (if  still in existence) afterSeptember 30th  may  be  divided into  three heads:     (A) Remnants of Uncompleted Administrative Work.    (B) Completion of Accounts and Financial Transactions.    (C) Measures of  permanent control to be made the subject of transfer to perma-nent Departments.    These are dealt with in order.    22. (A) As  regards the first class  of work, the  control exercised  by the wheat commission should come to an end  on or about December 31st.  The work of the sugar  Commission  should  be  completed by December 31st.  Stocks of tea will be finally absorbed by about the same date. Organised distribution of butter will probablybe required until the spring of 1920, and a certain control of cheese must be continued until about the same  date.    A considerable part of  this work will accordingly  come to an end on  December31st.  It is suggested  that the  Ministry of Food should cease to exist on  that date;and it is recommended that the responsibility in respect of such of the above commodities-commodities as still remain to be dealt with on December 31st, or such earlier date as may bedecided upon for the  dissolution of the Ministry, should be transferred to the Ministryof Supplies, with the exception that the fulfilment  of  any outstanding guarantees  to farmers which may then exist should be undertaken by the Board of agriculture.    Control of butter  and cheese could be continued without difficulty by the affiliationof the existing Butter and Cheese Imports Committee to the Ministry of Suppliesinstead  of the Ministry of  Food.    23. (B) So far as finance and accounting are concerned, probably between two andthree years will be required for the completion of the work.   In this&apos;  case also it issuggested that the responsibility should pass to the Minister of Supplies.  It is under-stood that probably H.M. Treasury would concur in this view.    It is  important that  the responsibility  for doing this work should be definitelyallotted as soon  as possible to some permanent Department which can  offer permanent
appointments  to retain the staff required for the purpose. ;. It will be quite impossibleto keep the necessary staff together on civil service salaries without the prospect ofpermanent, engagements.                                                     ;  1.     24. (C) It is for the  Cabinet to decide the extent,  if any, to  which permanentcontrol, either generally or in respect of particular commodities, should be maintained;and  their  attention  should  be  called in  this connection  to a speech (see Appendix)advocating continued control by the Ministry of Food or another single Departmentwhich was made at  the meeting of the Consumers Council, on April  9th, by Sir T. W.Allen,  the Deputy Chairman, and unanimously  approved by the Council.  reference should also be made to the resolutions of the National Executive of the Labour party and  of the Co-operative Union given in the Appendix.  If the view there put forwardis adopted, all the items set out,below, with the exception of  liquor control, would naturally go to that Department.  If it is not adopted, the various  items should  be distributed as  is  suggested  in each case.     25. Prices. There appears, first, to be no doubt that the public will require fullerinformation of the movement of prices than  was officially furnished before the war, andan assurance that proper supervision is being exercised in order to detect any undue in-creases  made  at the expense of the consumer.   There  is no  one of the permanentDepartments of  the Government which  deals with prices as a whole. Such work as isclone is at present  divided  between  the Board of Trade, the  Board of Agriculture, theMinistry of Labour and the Ministry of Food.     It is  recommended that this work should be undertaken  by a small permanentPrices  Commission  organised under and reporting  to  the  President of the Board ofTrade.  This  Commission  should presumably cover other commodities than food, e.g..clothing, fuel, etc.     26. Meat Supplies. As regards meat,  in particular,  a Committee (including two representatives nominated by the Ministry of Food) has recently been appointed by theBoard of trade to consider and report on the means of  securing&quot; sufficient meat supplies for the United Kingdom, at reasonable prices, with special regard to the development of meat production  in the United  Kingdom  and in the British Overseas Dominions, and tothe protection of British markets and of producing countries with the Empire fromdomination by foreign organisations.  These terms of reference include  considerationof the problem of the American Meat Trust.     27. Protection  of Consumers. Apart from the question of prices and supplies, aBill  is being introduced during the present  session, with the  concurrence of the Com-mittee on  Home Affairs, for making permanent, with a view to the protection of theconsumer, certain regulations regarding  net weight, specification, etc., which have been introduced by order of the Ministry  of Food during the war.   The President of theBoard of Trade  is in accord with my proposals in- this connection, and I recommendthat  the administration of the Act should be undertaken by his Department.     It  is  also a question  for consideration whether further steps should be taken toprotect  consumers  by giving to a  permanent Department (a) power  to fix prices,(b) power to license retailers.  These are points of considerable importance.  Any such powers  should presumably  be  exercised by the Board of Trade, but might be under-taken by the Local  Government Board or its successor.     28. In the four following, cases it is recommended that continued control shouldbe exercised:      Liquor Control. A memorandum has already (on March 27th) been  forwarded to the Cabinet recommending  that the Ministry of Food should be relieved at once ofthe  responsibility which it now exercises in respect  of  beer and spirits.  It  appears,however,  clearly to be a case in which a measure of  continued control  is necessaryafter the  dissolution of the Ministry of  Food; and it is considered  that the responsi-bilities  of the Ministry should pass to the  Home Office.     Milk-A separate memorandum on  the policy of  future milk control by  theGovernment is being placed before the  Cabinet.  It is considered that the carrying outof the  policy determined  upon should be  one  of the  functions of the Ministry ofHealth.
      National Kitchens-It IS  CONSIDERED THAT,  WHEREVER  POSSIBLE,  THE SYSTEM  OF  NATIONAL  KITCHENS AND RESTAURANTS SHOULD BE CONTINUED AND EXTENDED.   THE MINISTRY  HAVE ALREADY BEEN IN COMMUNICATION  ON THIS SUBJECT WITH THE Minister of Health, AND  IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT THE FUNCTIONS OF THE MINISTRY OF FOOD IN THIS CONNECTION SHOULD  BE TRANSFERRED TO THAT DEPARTMENT.      Farina Mills. FT IS CONSIDERED THAT RESPONSIBILITY FOR WORK IN CONNECTION WITH THE  PRODUCTION OF FARINA SHOULD BE TRANSFERRED TO THE board of Agricullure, FROM WHICH  DEPARTMENT IT WAS  ORIGINALLY TAKEN OVER BY THE MINISTRY OF FOOD. ONE MILL AT KING&apos;S  LYNN IS NOW IN  OPERATION, AND THREE  OTHERS,  WORK ON WHICH IS WELL ADVANCED, WILL BE  COMPLETED AS SOON AS FINAL EXPERIMENTS HAVE BEEN CARRIED OUT AT KING&apos;S LYNN.  IN THE  VIEW OF THE MINISTRY, THE ESTABLISHMENT AND  MAINTENANCE OF THIS INDUSTRY IS  OF  CON-  SIDERABLE  IMPORTANCE.      29. Statistical  Returns. THERE  ARE,  MOREOVER, THE FOLLOWING&quot;  MONTHLY  RETURNS OBTAINED BY THE  MINISTRY  OF FOOD WHICH SHOULD BE  CONTINUED :             (1) STOCKS OF  FOOD  IN THE COUNTRY,            (2) OUTPUT OF BACON AND HAM,  AND            (3) RETURN OF ANIMALS SLAUGHTERED.      IT IS  RECOMMENDED THAT (3) SHOULD  BE  UNDERTAKEN  BY  THE Board A/ Agriculture,  AND (1) AND (2) EITHER BY THAT BOARD OR BY THE Board of  Trade.   THESE DEPARTMENTS  ARE IN ACCORD WITH THE OPINION OF THE MINISTRY THAT THESE RETURNS SHOULD STILL BE MADE.      30. Documents and Records. THE REMAINING QUESTION FOR  DECISION IS THE DIS-  POSAL OF THE DOCUMENTS AND RECORDS  ACQUIRED BY THE  MINISTRY OF FOOD.  THEY  ARE NOW&apos;  BEING CLASSIFIED  AND INDEXED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ARRANGEMENTS AGREED  UPON WITH THE  RECORD OFFICE.  THEY SHOULD BE PLACED IN THE CUSTODY EITHER OF THE Ministry of Supplies  OR OF THE  Board  of Trade.   . .  31.. IT IS RECOMMENDED, AFTER CAREFUL CONSIDERATION, THAT PERMANENT CONTROL SHOULD  BE CONFINED WITHIN THE LIMITS SET OUT ABOVE.  EFFECTIVE CONTROL MAY INVOLVE,  ACCORDING  TO CIRCUMSTANCES, CONTROL NOT  ONLY OF PRICES BUT ALSO OF DISTRIBUTION AND OF SUPPLIES;  AND UNLESS THE GOVERNMENT ARE PREPARED TO  MAINTAIN  THE ORGANISATION  NECESSARY FOR  EFFECTIVE CONTROL, IT  IS CONSIDERED THAT IT SHOULD ACCEPT NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR CONTROL AT  ALL OUTSIDE CERTAIN QUITE DEFINITE LIMITS,  SUCH  AS THOSE NOW PROPOSED.      IT IS  THE OPINION OF THE MINISTRY THAT, SO  FAR AS* CAN BE  REASONABLY  FORESEEN,  THE  NECESSITY  FOR COMPREHENSIVE CONTROL IS NOT LIKELY TO ARISE.  IT IS ALSO CLEAR  THAT, PRO-  VIDED THAT ADEQUATE  SUPPLIES ARE AVAILABLE, PRICES ARE KEPT AT A LOWER LEVEL THROUGH THE  NATURAL ACTION OF ECONOMIC LAWS THAN UNDER GOVERNMENT INTERVENTION.
APPENDIX.       Resolution of National Executive of Labour  Party.  (April,  1919.)    &quot; The National Executive of the Labour Party views with alarm the proposal towind up  the Ministry of Food, and in the interests of the consumers calls upon theGovernment to reconsider any decision it may have taken which would have the effectof destroying the safeguards that have been built up during the war against profiteer-ing and speculation in the food of the  people.  It is strongly of the opinion that thepolicy of transferring to other Departments the functions hitherto carried on  by theFood Ministry will not make for efficiency in  the organisation  of the food supply orafford any protection to the consumers  against exploitation, and it urges the Govern-ment, on the  contrary,  to  concentrate under the  control  of the Food Ministry as apermanent Department of State, all the functions now carried on by the other Depart-ments  pertaining to the production,  distribution,  and  sale of  food,  the  fixing  of standards of quality, the regulation of prices, weights and measures, and the develop-ment of home-grown supplies.&quot;          Letter  from  Secretary to the Parliamentary  Committee of the                             Co-operative Congress.                 Parliamentary Committee of the Co-operative Congress,                                             4, Great Smith Street,  S.W.I.                                                             19th April, 1919.Dear  Sir,     At the last  meeting of the Central Board of the  Co-operative Union, held inManchester, the  delegates present, representing  3! million co-operators and not lessthan 10 million consumers in the United Kingdom, Were seriously concerned as to therumoured proposal of the Government to disband the Ministry of Food in Novembernext.    The very large constituency represented by my Committee and the  Central Boardof the Union have realised that, ki spite of some  inevitable defects, the Ministry ofFood has performed a  great service to the nation during the period of national crisis.They are equally convinced  that,  under the operation  of D.O.R.A., certain reformshave been effected as emergency measures which a generation of propaganda and agita-tion previous to the war had failed to secure.  They are anxious that, while the severerestrictions of  war-time necessarily pass away,  the  reforms above referred  to, whichare beneficial  to the community alike in peace and war, may  be retained and givenpermanent legislative sanction.  They are, moreover, confident that  the establishmentof the Ministry as a permanent Department of State properly conceived and adminis-tered  can only be of advantage to  the community.    At the present time there  are several  Government Departments dealing withparticular sections or aspects of the food problem which might be, with  advantage, co-ordinated under the control of one central authority.    In view of  these and  other circumstances which it is not necessary at the moment to detail, the following  motion was passed :     &quot;That this Board records its appreciation of  the  services rendered  to the  com-munity by the Ministry of Food during the war.  It recognises the  enormous  difficul-ties under  which the Ministry has laboured, but views with grave concern the proposalto abolish the Ministry  and to distribute its functions amongst the older departments of the State.    &quot;The  Board, therefore, strongly urges upon the  Government the  necessity of continuing the Ministry as  a  permanent Department charged with the maintenance of proper and adequate supplies; their equitable distribution at reasonable  prices; theirsale by nett weight or measure; standards of quality; the prevention of  waste;  the co-ordination of all existing Government agencies for promoting production and ensuringfood  supplies, such as the  Sugar Commission, the Wheat Commission; and such other
measures, essential alike in war and peace, as may be necessary to prevent profiteeringand the exploitation of consumers.&quot;    I am requested to convey to you the terms of this resolution and  to ask that itmay receive your earnest and favourable consideration.                                            I am, Sir,                                                 Yours faithfully,                                                        (Sgd.) HENRY  J. MAY.  The Rt. Hon. G. H. Roberts, M.P.,       Minister of Food,           Palace Chambers,               Westminster, S.W.I.Meeting of the  Consumers&apos; Council at &quot;Palace  Chambers, Westminster, on  the gth                                  April, 1919.EXTRACT  FROM  PROCEEDINGS.(Speech by  Sir  T.  W. Allen.)    As Deputy-Chairman of the Council, may  I  endeavour  in  a brief  word  toexpress to you  what I  interpret  to  be the mind of  this Consumers&apos;  Council  withregard  to  the  continuance  of  the  Food Ministry  as a  Department of  State?First  of all, there is  no general desire  on the  part  of  this  Consumers&apos;  Council if  I gather  their  views  aright that  control should  be  maintained  for  thepurpose of keeping this  Ministry alive or in existence just  for  that simple  purposealone, but they do view with some degree of alarm the efforts that  are  going on toscrap this Ministry entirely, and cause it to cease to be as a  Ministry by November15th next.   They recognise  that, with all the faults of the Ministry of Food, and withall  its failures to accomplish completely the task for which it was designed, yet it hasbeen  the one Department of State that has had the confidence and blessing of theconsuming public.  The consumers have looked to this Ministry of Food for protec-tion, and I believe it is correct to say that they have not looked in vain, but they  havenot ceased to look either to  this Ministry or to the Government  to protect them  withregard to the future.  You must be aware, as Food Controller, that during our 4! years&apos;experience of control there has grown up in this country a most powerful  system ofTrusts and  Combines and Associations and vested interests, which are a real menace to the State at the present time.   It is against these that the Consumers&apos;  Council feel the public should  be protected, and  instead of scrapping this Ministry  entirely,  they feel that it should undergo  a degree of reform that would  make  it a  really usefulpermanent Department of State.   The consuming  and labour interests  of  this Con-sumers&apos; Council feel that the one  interest which is not being safeguarded and  pro-tected as it  ought  to be  is.the consuming interest;  that there is too much anxiety perhaps on account of  either pressure on the part of the War Cabinet or of the vested interests in  the House  of  Commons  and trade interests without to  dissolve this ministry, and that all that is good is going to  be scrapped for  the time being.   Ofcourse, freeing the trade  may be the bondage of the consumer, and there is a fear thatfreedom of trade, as interpreted by the trading interests of this  country, is desired only by that one particular interest.  This Council is informed by the documents which weare now about to consider, that whatever is necessary or remains to be  done by this ministry shall be done by some other Departments of State.  For example, milk is togo to  the Ministry of Health, and  the question of ensuring standards of quality  may go  perhaps  to the Board of Trade.   Weights  and measures may  go to the LocalGovernment Board, and  the question of statistics also with regard to food prices may go to  the Board of Trade.  If I know the feeling of this Consumers&apos;  Council aright,they have no confidence  in any one of these Departments really to  protect the  con-:sumer, and what they are asking  you this morning, Mr.  Roberts, is  that you should
consider the advisability, not so much of scrapping this Ministry of Food as a Ministry.of Food,  but  of converting it into an even more useful  Department of  State-Chat;matters which are now carried on  by other Departments of State pertaining to food supplies should be brought  under  one Ministry call  it by what name you will thatthere should be one Department of State, and that it should have a measure of controlover production of produce,  whether it be wheat, or whether it  be  milk; that it shouldhave some control with regard  to distribution and supplies, and that it should have authority with regard to prices and standard of  quality as well.     What they desire to  ask  you is that a case  really should  be  put to the WarCabinet itself, not for the scrapping of  this Ministry, but  for its maintenance in someuseful  form in the interests  of the consumer, and for the consumers&apos; general protec-tion, and  that those  articles of food necessary to  life which are  being dealt with by-other Departments of State should be transferred to this Department of State, call it by what name you like the Ministry of Commerce, of Supply, or  of Production.  It doesseem that  a Department of State is  necessary to protect the consumer, both with regard tosupply, with regard to sufficiency of produce&apos;, with regard to home production, and  tostandard of quality, and in respect to proper weights  and  measures.     I  do  not know whether I  have interpreted the  Consumers&apos; Council  aright, butthey do want some indication from you in the directions I have mentioned, and they feel  at  the bottom of their  hearts that  all the good  is going to  pass away; that bypassing these  things over to various Departments nothing will come of it  ultimately.Now is the time and opportunity  in this new world we want  to see  created to createfor this country some Department of State that  will protect  the consumer, and seethat  he has good food at proper prices, with power to enquire into costs in all direc-tions, and direct and advise the Government, so that it may have a proper policy fromtime to time with regard to the feeding of the people.     I  would go further, and say  that there ought to  be protection in other directions..To-day, for example, if you want  to put your boy back into civilian  clothing, the suitwhich cost your.lad three guineas  before he went to serve his country, now, upon his return  into civilian life, costs him  nine guineas.   But I am  only  pleading  now that a beginning  shall be made, that there shall be a  Department which  shall  protect theconsumer  in the direction I have  indicated.  He needs protection in other directionsthan food.     I  would like to.add that it is not only that this Council has not confidence  inthese other Departments of State,  but it views  with  apprehension the division  of functions  that will take  place  if  the present functions of  the Ministry are  divided between different Government Departments.   It is scarcely worth their while to dealwith one article, or one phase of the  food problem.  You cannot expect the Board  ofAgriculture and Fisheries  to deal with fish in  all  its ramifications all  they careabout  from the  fishery point  of view is  that certain rights shall be protected withregard to  inland fisheries, but there  is a great problem in  the harvest of the sea  whichis not looked after by any Department of State which could well  be  harnessed  to thisDepartment.  Take the waste and great expense of  these Government Departments;take the Local Government Board, which is supposed to  look after  the rat plague  ofthis  country.  We have it on the highest authority that there  are as  many rats  to  befed  in this country as there are human  beings, and that they  are being fed at a costof 20 millions a year.  If you  can save a quarter of that cost by a  Ministry which iclooking after matters pertaining to waste of food, you would save the whole cost  ofthis  Ministry, even from  that point of  view; and I think that if  the Cabinet did look at this  problem from the consumers&apos; point of view rather than  from the trade interestspoint of view, they would see  that there is a good case for a Ministry of  Supply  orFood  for  the protection of the consumer.
