Spoltor is of great importance for the GalvanisingTrades  (in one &quot;branch of which -galvanised iron sheets - the pre-war export trade amounted to over  10,000,000in 1913) and for the Brass-making Trades of the  UnitedKingdom, and also, of course, for munition purposes.The pre-war consumption of Spelter in the United kingdom was of  the order of 200,000 tons, whilst the domestic production was only some 50,000 to 60,000 tons, theremainder of tho demand being met almost entirely fromGermany and Belgium.   About a dozen companies woreengaged in Smelting in the United Kingdom before thewar.2. The average price of g.o.b. spelter for the 5 years 1909 to 1913 was about  24 per ton, and in 1914 23.6.8.  In June 1915 the price of spelter had risen to  115 per ton,.   Shelter can now be imported from Americaat about  40 per ton, whereas the cost of producingspelter in the United Kingdom is at present about 60 per ton,3* Arranggments made by jtbo&apos; Ministry 01 Munitionsas*^to iTinc Bmol^ing.  The&apos;MnTs ry&apos;oOunitlbns made inidle an a^eemont whereby they took the whole output ofthe &quot;British Spelter &quot;makers, whoso present productivecapacity is pome 90,000 tons o^ shelter per annum,(thoughtho output recently has boon only about 3,600 tons per-month) at  50 per ton, plus the v increased cost oflabour and fuol  since thaTate of the agreement, it being estimated  that on these terms the smelterswould make no profit and incur no loss.  This arrange-ment, which involved the Government in a heavy loss,(since spelter for which tho Ministry was paying 56*60 per ton could be obtained from the U.S.A. at about   45 per ton) was made after consultation withthe Board of Trado and Treasury, on the ground thatit was very desirable to keep the industry going intho U..&apos;&apos;*, since  if tho smolting works were compelled toshut down tho dispersal of the very special kind oflabour  employed  and the deterioration of plant, wouldmake it almost impossible to rostart the industry afterthe war, and the United Kingdom spelter users wouldbo mado entirely dependent upon tho United States,which is endeavouring to  capture tho Britishgalvanising trade.4.  Tho futuro of tho &apos;,inc Smolting Industry in thoUnit^iU^dom.  The immediate quostiens upon which .aToolsTon&apos;i&apos;s &quot;dbelrod are therefore     (i) ShouB the arrangement mado by tho Ministry of  Munitions which is referred to in paragraph 3 bo  continued for a further period of say 6 ninths.
   (il) Should (jo v or meant; assistance  be afforded to   British smelters to maintain and extend the  industry   in the United Kingdom.     With ragard to (i) the  satiated cost of thearrangement based upon an output of 3.600 tons  per monthrepre sen is, after allowing for possible inorease  In toosts* a subsidy of about  75,000 per month,  and thoamount might increase as production advances.  Withregard to (ii) it is possible that fresh arrangements might be made involving a subsidy at  tho outset ofabout  15 per ton for the industry as a whole,  and theaggregate amount of such subsidy would thereafter depend upon the output of British works established, or to beestablished, bearing in mind that the oonsieption ofspelter in the United Kingdom before  the war  was about  *200;000 tons per annum.  It  is not possible to  say atpresent fcpw long any subsidy would need to be oon-tinued;  that would depend on the movements of  theworld&quot;s jrioo of spelter, and the cost of production.
