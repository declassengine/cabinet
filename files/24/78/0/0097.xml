The increase in the numbers of policieslodged by ELM.Forces may tend to fluctuate during the next fewweeks, owing to the changing proportion of men recently demobilisedwho have not work to which they may return.Appendix 2, gives an analysis of policies lodged by&apos;Industries.

In the insured group the chief point to be noted is-the suddenrise in unemployment in the Building and Works of Construction Group;there is no great change in any of the other insured groups.     In the uninsured group the number under the heading DomesticOffices and Services is steadily rising.    There is a slight fallin the number of Policies lodged under Textiles - Cotton,     In tho divisions unemployment is increasing in London and SouthEastern, and South Western Divisions and Scotland.
