CENTRAL AGENCY FOR THE ISSUE OF OFFICIAL COMMUNIQUES              BY GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS.          (Circulated by the  Home Secretary).      I do not agree with this proposal and&apos; tho suggestion that it has  tho approval of the Home Office is evidently due to a misunderstanding,    I  made a similar proposal when tho cloning  of tho Prens Bureau wan first  recommended ((LT.6742 of tho 3rd February) but I subsequently withdrew it  for the reasons given in a paper which I  cirouluted on -&quot;ho 10th March (G,T.  6960),   Such a scheme depends for its sucooss on tho measure of support given  to it by tho Press, and I am informed that the Press are strongly opposed  to it*   I think tho ordinary Press Agencies will do this particular work  bettor than any official machinery,  Tho Press Association for instanoe is  in close touch with all newspapers both in London and the provinces and is  always willing to meet requests for special circulation.   Only one copy  need be sent,      As regards conferences I believe this proposal would bo equally  unacceptable to the Press, who prefer that the minister who wishes to take  tho Press into his confidence should make his own arrangements through the  Newspaper Proprietors&apos; Association or othorv/ise.                                                          j                     I      In any case if a scheme of this kind is thought necessary I suggest that  it is not appropriate to tho work of the  ministry of Labour.                  \                                                            Ith April, 1919.                                                 E.G.
