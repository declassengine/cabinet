7AK j cabinet      lencr and urn from the Minister of Munitions.   I.   With reference.to paragraph 3 of Sir Alfred Mond&apos;sMemorandum (G.T. 7061) I note that the First Commissioner vfWorks is of opinion that there are not at the present timeany buildings available.to house a staff of 2500.  His re-quest that the War Cabinet should take no steps with regardto the general question.of accommodation for various Govern-ment Departments in view of the fact that the War CabinetCommittee on Accommodation is giving&apos; constant attention tothis question, is also noted,   2,   I observe, however, that in the Minutes of the Meetingsof the War Cabinet Committee on Accommodation dated 27thFebruary and 13th March a decision was reached by that Committeeto reserve for this Ministry accommodation for 1,500 personsin the new public offices in Great George Street.  So far asI am  a7are no action has followed on this decision, but I note that Sir A. mond hopes  shortly to be in a position to submit a report on this question.   3,   The increasing  difficulties with which the ministry is confronted in the  carrying out of its business in its presenthighly unsatisfactory  accommodation make it  imperative that  the1,500 places referred  to should be placed at the  disposal ofthe Ministry of Munitions immediately.   4,   For the efficient discharge of the Ministry1s triplefunctions of Liquidation of Contracts, Disposal  of SurplusProperty and the formation of a permanent Ministry of supply the  premises in which  the staff performing the principalfunctions aro housed  are most unsatisfactory,  The  accommodation
conditions are such as no business organisation would con-sldor suitable for successful administration and it is in-port ant in my view that the r&apos;,rar Cabinet should realise thatsuch conditions constitute a very sorlous bar to efficiency.The premises consist mainly of hotels commandeered in cir-ourastances of intense war emergency when considerations otherthau those of suitability and adaptability Y/ere paramount.A large proportion of the rooms in these hotels were designed for use as bedrooms, small in area, badly ventilated and,since they were designed for night occupation; inadequatelylit;  satisfactory heating has been impossible and pressure upon space has compelled also the dismantling of numerousbathrooms for use as offices.  Such conditions not onlyInterfere with the efficient discharge of the duties of thestaff employed and make proper supervision difficult, butalso render almost impossible the task of constructing thenew organisation for effectively carrying out the work of theMinistry of Supply.  There is also the unsatisfactory feature of the admittedly high cost to the Government of accommodation.in Hotel buildings.  The cost, for example, in the HotelMetropole for rent and rates alone is about  30 per head ofthe staff accommodated per annum, whilst the  cost of lightingand heating so many small rooms must be relatively  very high.   5.   Whilst the accommodation for 1,500 staff in the NewPublic Offices, provisionally allocated to this Ministry bythe War Cabinet Conmittee on Accommodation will not provideall that is required I an prepared, for the present, to accept such accommodation together with that no?/ housing the staffs of the Department of the Surveyor-General of  Supply in theWar Office, recently transferred to this Ministry,  since Ibelieve it will make a considerable improvement upon the present arrangements.
TV&quot;   6i    I propose to utilise the 1*500 places referred to do  soon as the space is at my disposal for accommodatingonly thoso divisions of tho staff whioh  sro engaged on themore central functions of the Ministryo  Having relinquishedso many buildings already (vido my Memorandum G/I&apos;. 70 6 tothe War Cabinet) I am not for the moment in a position tostate definitely which buildings could be released in  00.0-sequence of an allocation to this Ministry of a portion ofthe new public offices in Great George Streett  The/re  is&apos;;however, no question that the Ministry will be  able tovacate some accommodation immodiately the alternative accommodation referred to is placed  at their  disposal  andif the War Cabinet Committee on Aooomnodoticn desire it Ithink it would be possible  to vacate the Hotel  Metropole-q   -I would also see that every effort is made  so to  rearrangethe accommodation of  the  staffs  at present  housed in other buildings occupied by the Ministry as  to secure the  early release of  these buildings^April  17ths 1919.
