BOARD OF AGRICULTURE for SCOTLAND.

G.T.7150

REPORT for Week ended 23rd April, 1919.

I. FOOD PRODUCTION.

 1. Defence of the Realm Regulation 2.M.

 The Board issued an order under Defence of the Realm Regulation 2.M., requiring the cultivation of at least 40 acres oats on the farm of Kirkbride, Creetown, Kirkcudbright. In pursuance of the terms of Section 9 (1) of the Corn Production Act the tenant required that the question whether he should implement the requirements of the notice should be referred to arbitration. After some correspondence an arbitor was mutually agreed upon who, however, in view of other appointments was unable to act. Having regard to the delay involved in the appointment of another arbitor, and in view of the fact that the season was far advanced, the Board decided to withdraw their original order.

2. Supply of Fertilisers.

 (a) Sulphate of Ammonia.

 During the week 50 licences were issued under the Fertilisers&apos; Prices Order 1918, authorising the sale of 492 tons of Sulphate of Ammonia.

 (b) Export of Sulphate of Ammonia.

 The Board have arranged with the Sulphate of Ammonia Association for the export on the 17th instant of 440 tons of Sulphate of Ammonia.

 All large manufacturers have been requested to furnish particulars of the quantities that will be available for export during the current and next month it being assumed that the demand for home consumption has now been met.

II. WAGES OF AGRICULTURAL WORKERS.

 1. Investigating Officer.

 The Board have appointed Mr James McGavin, presently on the staff of the Central Wages Committee to be an Investigating Officer for the purpose of Part II of the Corn Production Act. Mr McGavin will act under the directions of the Central Committee and his duties will be confined for the present to the investigation of cases referred to that Committee by District Wages Committees.

 2. Extension of periods of Office of Wages Committees.

 The Board have also made Orders extending the periods of office of the Central and District Wages Committees, as at present constituted, until 31st December 1919.

IV. FORESTRY.

 Forest Nurseries.

 In order to provide for the lining out of young tree plants resulting from the sowings of seed in 1917 and for the sowing of seed during the current season, the Board have made arrangements with a number of woodland proprietors for securing nursery facilities on the4ir estates in addition to securing more ground for seed beds at the existing nurseries. The Board have at present in hand the work of lining out about 725,000 2 year seedlings in the nursely at Borgie (the Estate gifted to the nation by the Duke of Sutherland). A 5 years&apos; lease have been complete3d of a piece of ground, extending to about 4\\1//2 acres, at Kingswood near Murthly, Porthshire, where 80,000 2 year seedlings are being lined out. Provision has also been made for the sowing of a large quantity of seed of various species on this area.

 At the Craibstone nursery belonging to the Aberdeen College of Agriculture arrangements have been made to lay down an area of good beds extending approximately to 5 acres, making the total area available for seed beds and transplant lines at that nursery about 11 acres, and by agreement with the Middle Ward of Lanark District Committee facilities have been obtained at the H?yres nursery, Lanarkshire to lay down an area of about 2 acres in seed beds during the current season and thus increase the total area at that nursery to 4 acres. The Edinburgh and East of Scotland College of Agriculture have arranged to re-sow the vacated ground at their Liberton nursery in Midlethian.

 By arrangement with the Interim Forest Authority the stock of forest tree seed available for sowing in Scotland this season has been largely augmented. In consequence the Board have approached the Scottish Seed and Nursery Trade Association with a view of effecting an agreement for the sowing of additional quantities of seed by members of the Association during this year. It is anticipated that sufficient ground will be made available to permit of all the seed now in stock being sown.

V. LAND SETTLEMENT.

 1. Applications for Small Holdings from ex-service mon and others.

 The total number of applicatoins received from Soldiers or Sailors to 19th April, 1919 is 955. This figure cannot however be taken as representing the actual demand from men who served with the Forces as a considerable proportion of the 10,000 applications received from Civilians before or during the War were from men who subsequently served with the Forces. Steps are being taken with the aid of the Board&apos;s Soldier&apos;s and Sailer&apos;s Bureau to ascertain this demand and also to bring before Commanding Officers and Territorial and other, Associations particulars of the Board&apos;s Schemes with/


 with a view to enabling men who have not yet lodged applications as Soldiers or Sailers or as Civilians to do so.

 It has only recently been possible owing to lack of staff to make systematic arrangements to interview applicants and to report on their qualifications at a reasonably early date following upon the receipt of applications.

2. Land Settlement - Small Holding Colonies Acts 1916-18.

 Of the subjects already acquired under these Acts, extending in all to 6830 acres, the Board are in actual occupation of

  904 (260 acres at Midlecharwoods

      (644 acres at Arabella

 Entry will be taken at Whitsunday 1919 to

  600 (264 acres at Nether Locharwoods

      (322 acres at Wester Arboll

      (14 acres on Foulden Estate

 In addition it is probable that satisfactory arrangemetns will be made with the tenant of Lower Pitkorrie Farm (Ross-shire) (208 acres), whereby she will relinquish her tenancy at that term without compensation for disturbance.

 Schemes for utilising these areas as Small Holdings and for training are in active preparation.

 During the week the Board advanced negotiations for the purchase of the Estate of Fortrie in Aberdeenshire (835 acres), and the Estate of Moy in Kintyro, Argyllshire, (330 acres). They also carried to an advanced stage negotiations with the proprietor of the Estate of Mordington in Berwickshire for leasing for 250 years at a rent of £2150 the two farms of Lamberton and Mordington, extending to 2300 acres.

 3. Purchase of Land in Congested Districts of the Highlands

 To relieve unrest and to meet the large demands for Small Holdings from the people in the Hebridean districts, many of whom have been on service with H.M. Forces, the Board have lately been in negotiation for the purchase of certain farms in Skye, North Uist and Barra. The farms under notice comprise these of Eoligarry (Barra), Newton and Cheesebay (N. Uist), Ulinish etc. (Skye), Kingsburgh (Skye) and Balranald (N. Uist). In the two latter cases the Board have tendered offers of £10,000 and £8,000 respectively.

 4. Small Landholders (Scotland) Acts 1886-1912.

 During the past few weeks thirteen small holders have been settled on the farm of Burnton (Dalrymple, Ayrshire), which was made available at Martinmas 1918 for sub/




 sub-division into small holdings. Of these thirteen holders, five are demobilised soldiers, and the majority of the remainder are parents of service men. Eighteen holders altogether will be accommodated on this farm.

 Preparations are far advanced for the settlement of a certain number of small holders at Whitsunday next on the farms of Shinness (Sutherland) and Lybster (on the Estate of the Office of Woods in Caithnees). On the latter Estate the farm of Skaill (937 acres) will be made available for the Board&apos;s purposes at the same term, and arrangements for ingoing and management are completed. At present it is proposed to constitute thirty small holdings on Shinness Farm and six on Lybster.

 The Board also have other schemes on hand for the settlement of men on farms at the forthcoming Whitsunday term.

 5. Negotiations are proceeding in numerous cases in all parts of the country with a view to obtaining land under the Small Landholders Acts and otherwise. At present one of the Board&apos;s officers is engaged in Shotland, from which over 900 applications for the holdings have been received by the Board, with a view to early action in the formulation of schemes. In recent years war conditions have made progress impracticable in this area.

 6. The Board have recently received the Secretary for Scotland&apos;s approval to sell sheep stock to holders on credit in congested districts. This direction will facilitate the settlement by the Board of holders on Bergie, Shinness and many other schemes which would otherwise be difficult to carry out owing to the present high prices of sheep stock.
