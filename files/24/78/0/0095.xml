 DiRBCTOMma  OF  megg(Circulated by the Home Secretary)Beport No.. 1..Sootland House,ON KEVOLUTIONABY ORGANISATIONS IK THS UNITiJD KINGDOM30th April. 1919.     Ehe satisfactory tone on whioh I commented threeweeks ago has been maintained, oontrary to expectations,because the release of the Conscientious Objectors set free a number of able and persuasive agitators.   IHaefaot is that the extremists of the Independent LabourParty, have greatly overdone their commendation of theRussian Revolution and the Soviet form of Government.     !Ehe re-opening of race meetings and other forms cfsport have had a great effeot in the Midlands and the North,md my correspondent from Nottingham describes the tone  inhis area as &quot;happy and oontented.0  He mentions that thedemand for. tiokets for the Calcutta Sweepstake at 13s.  4d.eaoh is far. greater than the  supply, and says that theworkers have not yet lost hope that the Government may  be persuaded to issue Premium Bonds at some future time.  Atthe some time, the quiet majority who are against disorderlyrevolution.will continue to vote for extremists as long as     2kiy Lancashire correspondent says that working men are determined that nothing of the kind that has happened iniiussia shall take place in this oountry.     fjhe present state of quietude willl come to an end assoon as unemployed benefit oeaBes and the inflated wagesgive way before the  laws of supply and demand.  Ihe newspirit among Labour  is a determination that they  shallnot be ordered about either by the employer or their ownthey think that they oan obtain concessions for them.Union/
     TMiOivo:tTlcae^                        that the world lo     not ao constituted that everyone oeJk^JUUew^^^     whims, there will be A reorudescenoe of unrest of a     revolutionary type.THE &quot;DAILY HalHALD&quot;&quot;tiffffn II Wti iiSaCX^iiTifi U linn ilTI Mi          !33ie &quot;Daily Herald&quot; is doing its best to discredit the     reports from russia, but It is not going very well in     Lancashire.   As an example of Its methods t&amp;a case ef     Monsieur Moulin may be cited.   A number of articles were     published under his name as &quot;Our Special Correspondent In     Russia,&quot; but on being questioned It turned out that the     &quot;Daily, Herald&quot; people first met him through ordering     drinks for him in the Cafe konioo In London, and  that the     whole  of his articles were written by  Mr. Norman  Angell     (otherwise Lane) and that a number of  opinions were put     into his mouth whioh he does not hold.  $ae &quot;Dally Herald&quot;     hopes  to  capture the working man through Its sporting page.     Sporting news has an irresistible appeal both  In  Lancashire     and Yorkshire.   !Ifoe &quot;Evening  Chroniole&quot; published in     Manchester, whioh gives special prominence  to  sporting     news,  is  enormously popular with the workers who, having     bought  the paper, read  its  other  contents whioh,  In the  oaoe     of the &quot;Evening  Chroniole&quot;, are  strongly anti-revolutionary.     The extremists have done  their utmost  to get the  workers to     boycott It,  but without suooess.          At a meeting at the  Brotherhood  Church on the l^th     April, tar. Lansbury claimed for  the Herald a oiroulatlon of     Just  over a quarter of a million,  but  admitted that the     paper&apos;was not yet paying.    It is  believed to be run on     oapital subsorlbed  by  Nr. Karben,  kiss Dodge and the Indian     Nationalists,  but  the  names  of the  subscribers have not     yet  been  disclosed.          All  my correspondents lay great stress upon the                                                      die o on tent/- z
      dtaoorrtenVwnlott^                  Order has caused.   Itf     appears  to  be one  of  those oonoe43Bions&quot;^/iriii^^      the opposite of  that  whioh was  intended.   The men look      upon  it  as  &quot;olass  legislation&quot;  In favour of the rioh club      man at the  expense of the plain working olass club man.      Organized labour does not reqolre the earlier opening,  of      public houses.   It would rather have a larger beer supply      with  a closing hour at about  11 p.m.            The Liverpool dockers have their own way of protesting      against  the beer shortage.    They refuse to handle  beer and      spirits  for export as a protest.    In various parts of the      country  there has  been looal  disorder in publio houses.  CONSCRIPTION  AND              M RUSSIA            i3ve-7  section of the workers appears  to be against      Con ecnp lion and Intervention in  Buss ia.   Even mild Trades      Unionists  are  said to be strongly moved over these  two      matters  because  they  think  that it  is  the  1 thin end of the      wedge&apos;  towards making oompulsory  Military Service  a      permanent institution.   They have  no  sympathy for  the      Russian  Bolsheviks,  and their objection to intervention is       that they do not see any neoessity  for it.   They  say that      xiussia has never been any good to us as an Ally,  and should       be left to settle her own affairs.    Ho British lives ought       to be lost for her sake.   On  the other hand, it is not at       all likely that anything drastio will be done to stop       oonsorlption and  intervention, far drastio aotion means       the loss of  va^es for themselves.    If their Bxeoutives       choose to call a strike they will oome out, but their       feeling is not strong enough to force the hand of their      Executives.  SHOP SMAjSPS.            In illustration of the apathy of the rank and file as       regards strikes,  it may be mentioned that on April 13th at       a,meeting of Shop Stewards oalled at the Sooiallst Hall,         \                                                            Qp^ashaw;
                         o* 4 **Openshaw, Manchester, only five Shop ^tewe^ds^ouldJbe-induoedto attend.   It was then resolved that it was useless toorganise euV-of-wsiyk..demonstrations, as the majority tf theworkers seemed to be satisfied with things as they were.With the unempleyment benefit and out-ef-werk pay from theUnions, the unemployed were able to get slang very well andenjoy their holiday.   The Mersey workers, a very revolution-ary body, also find the rank and file apathetic.   Onlyeight turned up at the last meeting, and  it was decided netto meet again until the workers gave them more support.   Ata widely advertised meeting at the Bull Ring, Birmingham,.on April 4th. the attendance was so small that one of the speakers described It as a &quot;wash out&quot;.    The rank and fileare, in fact, turning more towards their  Trades&apos;Union leaders.     Among  the rougher olass  such as boilersealers and  deoklabourers there  is a strong feeling in favour of punishment*f  the Kaiser.   They say that we punished Napoleon, whe wasa better man than &quot;Kaiser Bill&quot;, and they de not see why heshould get  off.   Thay are  less  concerned about theindemnites.   The news that  the  Kaiser is only  to  be  admonishedis  likely to  cause keen  dissatisfaction.      Ther%  is great  rejoiolng in Socialist and  Labour olrolesat  the results  of  the Slootiong  for Guardians.   Forgettingthat only about 30 per  oent ef the electorate voted and thatthe opposition  te  the Labour Candidates was  very  half hearted, they think  it  certain  that a Labour Government  will bereturned at the next General Sleotion.      The Glasgow strike  leaders reoeived the following                                               sentences
     sentence a  j-          SHBMUL  .... Five months for ixwirtement.          OALJACHaft ... rive mtftthfl ftr incitement,          HOBMY......three months fwr rioting.          HoOA&amp;TNSY ... OStxreo Rpntha for rioting.          The rest  vreraufound not guilty.          John  McLean, addressing a meting of about 2,000 at     Paisley en the 7th April,  said that Lenin and Tretsky had     appointed  him  first  President of tho  Soviet Regpublio ef     England, and he was  engaged in farming his first Soviet     Government.    He had already appointed William Gallaofcer     as the first Chief Justloe of the Hew Bepublio.   McLean     is described as a spent force in Glasgow, where very     few take him seriously, and many regard him as insane.     He has also  made speeches  at Oleator  Moor and Sgrement,     where he appears to  have disgusted his audience with his     irresponsible  vehemenoe.    His  meeting at Werkington     was broken up  by a  large  body of discharged soldiers.          A Glasgow Shop  Steward says that the mild sentenoes     show that  the  Government  is afraid of the Brtromists, and     that an agitation for their release will at once  be set     on foot,  but it is  very unlikely that they will suooeed     in calling a strike  to enforce  their  demand.   They     expooted  from three to seven years.          Generally speaking,  the  Clyde  is very quiet,  and a     correspondent describes Glasgow as  being in a state of     perpetual  holiday,  with young men and women tripping     along the streets with every  appearance  of happiness.     &quot;The general feeling&quot;, he  says, &quot;is  to  let everything go     to the wind and rest both  mind  and  body,   The ordinary     renk and file  are  as docile as  pet rabbits&quot;.PERNICIOUS I&amp;APLETa.          The  3,eaf let,  a oopy of whioh  is attaohed  to  this     report, headed &quot;To British Sailor siM, was widely     distributed last we-ek. in Liverpool and Hosyth, and pro-     bably In  other ftdval Ports.   It appears  to have  had  no                                                    kind/
kind of success.   It la believed to have been printed byArnold Yatea, 9, ahx*twiok street, ikigehiU, Liverpool,and a search of his premises was made last week.     A search of two men suspected of distributing the leaflets was made in Edinburgh0 and a large quantity wereseized.   The men are to bo proseouted.     &quot;The International&quot;, a leaflet journal published InJohannesburg, Is arriving by post In this country,   Xtprofesses to contain a manifesto by Llebkneoht, urgingsoldiers to attack their Officers and disarm them, toset fire to barracks and munition depots, to open flro onloyal groups, and to sink ships when mutiny fails.   ThePostmaster General will be asked to confiscate this paperif It oan be deteoted In the mail.     A good deal Is being done by private enterprise to combat Bolshevism, and  the newspapers have  been givingmuch spaoe to news from Russia.   Hackensmldt, thewrestler, is conducting a tour of lectures  on  the evilsof Bolshevism.   He was interned as an enemy civilianIn Germany during the War, arid speaks with  experienceof how Bolshevist doctrines were  spread  amongst the prisoners.   He speaks English well, and is said to carryhis audience with him.   His wife Is a French  woman andthey  intend  to  settle In England.      Some harm  appears  to have  been done by the widecirculation  of  statements about the nationalisation ofwomen in uussia, which  lo apparently untrue as far  asthe Soviet Government is  oonoerned.    Dr. Kiokman, who IsIn request  as a speaker at  advanced meetings,  said  ata meeting of  the  &apos;Hands Off -Russia&apos;  Committee on  the  6thApril,  that the notice  quoted In the  &quot;Times&quot;  was postedby  anarchists  In  Saratov  on the same  notice-board asthat  used  by the  soviet Authorities, who left tho noticestanding because  they thought It good propaganda  against                                                     the/

Writing to Georges Brandes at CfopenhageA^Jior^l^Ba^     that he is in touch with a Branch of the Union of     Democratic Control founded by French men and women in     Paris.   He describes the British Labour Party as the     most ignorant on international affairs of any movement     in Europe, and takes oredit to himself for the &quot;small     measure of enlightenment shown during the last six months&quot;.     He  is  getting  in touch with Gioletti&apos;s daughter, Signora     Chiaravlglio.   He asks Brandes  to beoome &quot;corresponding     member&quot; in Denmark. COMkAMDaft WEDGWOOD.. M*P.          Commander Wedgwood, M.F., has applied to  join  the     Hanley Branch  of  the Independent Labour Party  &quot;as one who     will do his  best  to  secure  a  free oo-operative oommon-     wealth and  the brotherhood of man&quot;,   He  does  not intend      to offer  himself  for re-election until  the end of the      present Parliament.

This Union,  whioh has now beoome definitely a Branoh      of the Hesald League, does not appear to be  prospering      financially, nor to be winning members among serving      soldiers and sailors.   It is  7$ in debt and the      Seoretary has had to pawn his watch and chain to mjet      current expenses.   Mr. carmichael, of the London Trades      Council, who is to be found  in nearly all these subversive      movements such as the Polioe Union, is joining this Union,      and is expeoted to  take an active part.   Tebbenham, a      Petty Officer in the Navy, has  been drafted to South      America, but  the Union officials say that he  established      flourishing Branches at Harwioh and Devonport before he       left.   The Union has now an Advisory Committee consisting                                                             of/

Hodges,  of the     Miners1 Federation, and Faul, the itevolutionary,  a claBS     of people whioh is not likely to appeal to the serving     soldier.OOUmiDM THff HON. J.k. K NW(M?HY. K.N.          Commander the Hon. J.k, Kenworthy, E.N., who was     recently elected Liberal kember for Hull, is the  eldest     son of Lord Strabolgl.   Ke was reported to the Pelloe     some time ago as giving financial assistance to the     Bailors&apos;, Soldiers&apos; and Airmen&apos;s Union, and to be     attending revolutionary meetings, one on the 9th  Maroh     being particularly mentioned, at which he said that the     Navy was ripe for revolt.   He was interrogated by me on     the 12th karchft in the presenoe of the Direotor of Naval     Intelligence, when he gave a denial of all these     suggestions, admitting only that he knew the President     and Secretary of the &amp;.8.A.U., Captain Donisthorpe and     ex-Sergeant Stanhope, socially, and that he was,  as a     prospective Member of Parliament, naturally interested     in all social questions.   He denied emphatioally that     he had paid any money.   When asked for his political     opinions, he said that the only Boole ties to which he     belonged were the Fabians and  the Guild Socialists$ but     admitted, after some hesitation, that his views had     advanoed considerably beyond the Fabians, and  that he     followed the dootrines of Karl Marx, whioh declaration  is     rather interesting when it is  borne  in mind that Commander     Kenworthy gained his seat in Parliament as a Liberal.          Further enquiries show  that Commander Kenworthy has     really been aotlvely associated with the S.S.A.U;  that     he attended and called meetings on the 7th, 9th, 10th and     16th February, at whioh he expressed himself strongly as                                                          a/

Bums on various    occasions towards the working expenses of the Union,   It    has been alleged by a member of the S.S.A.U. that he was                                                                  1    the first to introduce the Bolshevik element into the                                                                  ii    Union.   At a meeting held by Kenworthy at the Abbotsford     f    Hotel. Russell Square, on February 9 th, at whioh W.F. Watson,    Colonel Malone, M.P., and koLean, M,,P., and others were    present, he was given the title of &quot;CommiBsary of the Navy&quot;,    Vifaioh position he hopes to hold if a Soviet Government is    for Lied  in England,         He also attended a meeting at 7* Featherstone Buildings,    the Headquarters of the I,lff.W., on the 24th April, after    getting a seat  in the House, and told the meeting that he    had  been interviewed by the Direotor of Naval  Intelligence,    that he had fenoed with him, and that he, the  Direotor, had    not  got any information out of him that mattered muoh.  He    also denounced  Major Dowding, of H.M.S. &quot;Curaoea&quot;, as    being a spy, and said  that potty Offioer Tebbenham   had    telegraphed to  him, saying  that he had been victimized.    He  added, &quot;I do not know  what I  oan do in the  House  about    the  matteri because  if you  don&apos;t think just their way, or    say  anything that does not  suit  them,  they  simply  shout    you dOTGi and you  oan&apos;t get  a hearing..........   Of course,    I stood for election as  a Liberal, and shall continue  to    pose ae such,  especially to the  Press&quot;.   He gave  5s.  Od.    to the  oclieotion.     All this,  of course,  shows that his    answers, given quite voluntarily in  this Office, were    untrue.W WATSTN AND BAWj,? CONVICTIONS.          At e  meeting held in Trafalgar Square  on the 13th    April,  at vfaioh over 2,000 people  were present, strong     speeches were  delivered about the  oonvictions of Watson     and Ramsay, and the deportation of Lillian Troy, the
                           *- 1Q -     Amerioan woman associated with Baron von Horst.    Between      6 and  7 was oolleoted, but no resolution was passed, *          Aooording to Mr, Philip Snowden, the Branches of the     Independent Labour Party have inore&amp;sed during the year by     139 and the membership by 11,000,   He says that the     relations of the Party with the offioial Labour  Party,  whioh     have been strained during the War, are now again more     cordial.          The Annual Conference took place at Huddersfield on     the 21st and 22nd April, when an amendment in favour  of the     Soviet system of Government was rejected almost  unanimously.     air, Bamsay Macdonald even went so far as to ridicule  the     principle of delegation in the Soviet system, and said that     the best example of it was the House of Lords,   Resolutions     were passed demanding civil liberty, the release of     politioal prisoners and conscientious objectors, and  a     general amnesty on the signing of tho Peaoe Treaty,   The     Conference passed a resolution by 251 votes to 245,     supporting the declarations of the Berne International     Congress,   Miss Pankhurst regards this as a condemnation     of the Soviet and the dictatorship of the proletariat&apos;.          This Party, whioh claims to be the only genuine     Bolshevik Party in Great Britain, held a three days1     Conference at Manchester on April 19th, 20th and 2lst,     The object was to unite tho various revolutionary elements     in the country, but their actual achievement was to re-draft     their own constitution in the hope that time would do the     rest,m MM OF ,aresm*          Deportation Orders have been made against a number of     Russians, including known Bolsheviks.   It is hoped that a                                                       vessel/

The detention of these men has,     to quote the words of a oiroular letter from the United     Ladies&apos; Tailors&apos; Trades Union, &quot;struok terror inte the     hearts of the rank and file&quot;.SINN FBI IN IN WALES.          The Liberty League, founded at Merthyr for the self-     determination of the smaller Nations, and abolition of the     Monarchy, has now thrown off its disguise and declared     itself to be a  Sinn Fein organization.   It has changed its     name to the  &quot;Sinn Fein  club&quot;.   The members are, of  course,     Irish miners,          The reason why the South Wales  vote went  so  strongly     in favour of aooepting  the  Government  terms in  spite of  the     advice of the  leaders,  is  believed to  be due to the  fact     that,  though the  leaders belong for  the most part to the     independent Labour Party,  the rank and file do  not,  and     when  there  is  a seoret ballot they  oah always  be counted on     to be reasonable.

The Russian Sailors were the first to begin the RusBian devolution    It could not      have succeeded but for them.     The Russian sailors grew tired of fighting for a country inwhioh the Czar and the landowners and capitalists were the rulersand lived in great wealth, whilst the people were ground down inpoverty and subjeotion.     The Russian Revolution has plaoed the  workers of Russia in control of the Army and,Navy, the industries and the government&quot;Itself.     ThQ Government,, consists of sovietB or ocuncils, of delegatesappointed ty soldiers and sailors and the workers In industry andon the land.   The delegates to tho national soviet are instructed by and report to those whom they represent and oan be changed at rany time.   Those wjao do not work cannot vote.     The industries and the land have beoome the property of thenation and are managed by the workers in the industries and onthe land.     Sduoation is free to all, right up to the university, andthere is only one class of sohool for all children In which thebest possible education is given.     There is a standard wage alike for editors and oompositors,ministers of state and miners.     Child Labour is abolished from the year 1920, after whiohno one under 20 years may work for a living arid as poverty willhave disappeared the parents will not miss their children&apos;earnings because there will be no more poverty in SocialisticRussia.     Distinctions of olass and titles of rank have been abolished.In Russia there is now but one olass, the people.     This is justloe beoause it gives real equality to all men andwomen.     We want that sort of justice in this country.     But Capitalists, Kings and Autocrats are afraid of that sort of justice.   They do not want to be plaoed on the same footing with the ordinary man and woman.   Therefore they are attackingRussia, and using the sailors end soldiers of Britain, Franoe,Amerioa, Japan and other oountries to do the fighting while mostof them stay safely at home.     The Russians ask the working people, the seamen, and theprivates of this and, other countries, why, they should oome toRussia to flight a government of working people in the interestsof the rich, and should help to starve the Russian workers Intosubjection to Czars, landlords and capitalists again.     Why ask us why we do not have a revolution of our own and get control of our own oountry V     And why not Y                                                           The/TO   BRITISH   SAILORS
