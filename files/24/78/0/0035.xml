WAR  CABINET.Bet1456.  11.RSLEAS5 OF MILITARY HUTS FOR CIVILIAN            ACCOmiCDATIOH.^^BXT^f^&apos;^gran^U]a ^y-^^e Secretary of State for 7ar.  icTr&quot;culate a memorandum prepared &quot;by the Quarter Master General  31st April, 1919..                                 (intd.) tf.S,C   *    &apos;    With reference to &apos;Var Cabinet paper G.T.7016 in which  the Minister of Munitions points out the desirability of releasing  Army Huts  for conversion into  cottages without delay, the Quarter  Master General offers the following observations.            The War Office are fully alive to  the necessity of  disposing  of as many of these  hut-s as can be spared &apos;*&apos;ith due regard  to military necessities, and arrangements are no*&quot;  being made to  dispose  of approximately 2,150 huts, or.their equivalent in hutting  material,  in addition to some  850 which have already been released.            The 7ar Office policy since the Armistice has been first  to surrender hired and requisitioned buildings  or  billets, and  priority in surrendering such  buildings was given  to those requiied.for  industrial purposes.   It is considered economically unsound to  dispose  of large numbers of huts v/hile at the same time regaining  factories  and private houses0   The huts are not  immediately ready  for occupation as  civilian dwellings; the factories, schools and  private  dwellings  can be practically at once restored to their former  use,  Very few men are now accommodated in hired  or requisitioned  buildings,  for instance, in  the A&quot;idershot Command, a very populous Commancj  only  450 of all ranks are so accommodated-   A.  further&apos;example of the  amount of  accommodation set  free for civilian purposes is shown by  the fact that by the end of March 1919, 1090 Military Hospitals had  been  closed, and the buildings thus set free, i,er Civilian Hospitals,  Asylums, Educational Establishments, restored to  their before war  purposes.            Nevertheless, in spite of the pursuance  of this policy, it  has been found possible, as  stated above, to release a dertain nnmber  of  huts; and  over 3,000 huts, or  their equivalent  in  material net yet  put together, have actually  been, or are  an process  of being, released.  This  number of Hats is equivalent to accommodation for 90,, 000 menD Once  the camping season opens .n  April 19th  it will  be  possible to release i more  hats.            It may be argued that the reduction in  barrack and hutting  accommodation has  not progressed pari passu with  that  in ration strength,  r:he ration strength in Great 3ri tain &quot;and&quot;! r eland  has been reduced from  approximately 1,500,000 at the beginning  of December 1918 to 720,000 on  1st Ap r i I1919,   The barrack and hutting accommodation during the samebeen reduced to approximately 1,] CO, 000.  The reason why thereduction in botn cases has nob been proportionate is that in order to-store the vast quantities of equipment,  stores,  etc  coming into this .country from overseas,  accommodation normally allotted to personnelhas to be used for this purpose.,  Moreover,  large camps are being usedV the American and Dominion Forces for  repatriation purposess., Thu-aeare practically empty one day and full the next,  144 Regular infantry battalions,  and a proportionate number of R.A.-, and R 3 . Units are en route from overseas to be reformed, and  accommodation lias to be earmarked for their reception.At
          At the present moment there is not a large  camp  inGreat Britain..or Ireland which ia not either occupied or earmarked for immediate occupation, except NIGG Camp, north  of  CromartyFirth, anC. orders for the dismantling and disposal  of that  camphave &quot;been icsBued,          As stated above, once the  camping season Commences,further huts can &quot;be released,: hut if huts are released too  quicklyit will mean that private houses and industrial premises cannot  be dispensed with,
