 THIS Docj-^ROENT  IS  THE PROPGPTY (\FCIRCULATED BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA.I &quot;2^iceroy, Army Department, to Secretary of State for India,               18///. April  1919.     5342.   18th April.  Secret,   internal situation  necessitates  review ofour military strength in event of disorders spreading.     2. Salient features from military points of view are :-       (a) Attacks on and interruptions of railway and telegraph, commoni-             cations in Gujrat and Punjab, coupled with partial strikes and             unrest among Indian personnel and sympathy with Satyagraha             among Government employees.       (6) Fraternisation between Hindus and Moslems.       (c) Moslem  distress  and  bitterness  over Turkey&apos;s  threatened  dis-             memberment and. consequent alarm that Caliphate and Moslem             control of holy places are in jeopardy.       (d) Possibility of trouble  spreading to North-West Frontier tribes,             especially under influence of  (c).   Frontier remains  quiet, and             there is no evidence so far of its being  affected.  Material is,             however, inflammable.       (e) Unsettled state of Afghanistan consequent on assassination of  one             Amir, abdication of another, and accession of  third.&apos;  Amanulla             is  now consolidating his  power  apparently  with  success.             Possibility of failure, however, coupled  with  cumulative effect             of (6) and (d), must enter into our calculations.     3. So long as loyalty of Indian  troops remains undoubted, we can dealwith  even  worst  contingency (internal disorder plus tribal-cum-Afghans)with our existing resources.   Loyalty of  Indian  troops  is thus crux of wholemilitary problem.   We  believe them to  be  staunch.   Attempts to sap their loyalty are  inevitable, but primd facie such,  attempts should  have little chance of success  owing to  their good condition and  high  morale of unitsreturning from  overseas.   History, however, forbids us  to  neglect  pre-cautions  against-contrary event,  especially  if disorder affects demobilisedsoldiers and spreads to  areas from which troops are  drawn.   Even  so, it ishistorically improbable  that all Indian units would be  unreliable.   At first,however, we should not know on which units we  could rely.   Hence we  feel it prudent  to  estimate  our resources  in worst contingency  on sole basis ofBritish, Gurkha, and (if we can secure them) Nepalese  units.     5. In this situation our deficiency  in British  troops would  be consider-able, and is estimated  at 4  infantry divisions and 4 cavalry  brigades, allunits being  British.     6. There is  no present cause for alarm, but  recent events  in India havedisclosed a situation, though at this moment improving, yet contains elements of grave uncertainty as  to the future.  We therefore  consider it our duty toplace before you  the above  considerations in their  worst possible  aspect,bearing in mind that the transitional character of the  Army in India rendersit very essential  that you should receive earliest information of demands thatwe may be compelled to make on  you should the political  situation in Indiaand the Frontier assume its most unfavourable aspect.SS 81 60  4/19
