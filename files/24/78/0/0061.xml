Summary.      I.  RUSSIAN  relations with  China date from the Treaty of Nertchinsk, 1689, which was the first treaty contracted by China with a foreign Power.  By this treaty the Russian frontier in  East Siberia was  set back behind  the Argun and the Amur watershed.     The  relations thus begun were  extended  by the  Treaty of Kiakhta, 1727, which fixed the  frontier  along the  greater  part of North Mongolia and established an &quot;Ecclesiastical Mission &quot; at Peking; by two conventions of 1768 and 1792, regulating- frontier commerce;  and by the Kuldja Convention of 1.851, which controlled the trade of Kuldja  and Tarbagatai (Chuguchak).     2. The modern forward policy in East Siberia and Manchuria was initiated by Count JMuraviev  about 1847.  The Amur,  a  Chinese  river, was explored, and  settle- ments were founded in Chinese territory in the &apos;fifties.  To  make these encroachments valid, pressure was exercised by Muraviev at a time when China was in straits through rebellion and the  Second  China War; and  by the Treaty of  Aigun, 1858, the  whole of the north  bank of  the Amur became Russian, and the Ussuri territory was held in common pending  a  settlement.   In 1860 Ignaiiev secured  the cession of the Ussuri territory by a convention signed at  Peking.     3. Russia occupied the Hi valley in 1871 during an insurrection.  A part of  this was restored to China by the Treaty of St. Petersburg, 1881.     4. To obtain the retirement of Great  Britain  from Port Hamilton, Russia gave China an  assurance  in  1886 that  she  would not occupy Korean territory in  any circumstances.     5. At the close of the Chino-Japanese War.  1895, Russia headed a coalition to exact the retrocession of Kuantung (Liaotung).     6. China  showed her gratitude by  giving   Russia  the right to  carry  the Trans-Siberian  Railway  across  North Manchuria.   But  when  Germany occupied Kiachow  Russia  obtained  the  lease of  Port Arthur and the  Kuantung territory (1898), which Japan had been forced to retrocede in 1895.     7. Russian objections  to  British railway  enterprise   in  Manchuria  led  to  a Russo-British Railway Agreement, 1899.     8. During the Boxer outbreak in 1900 Russia overran Manchuria.   By an agree- ment of April 1902, the terms  of which  were moderated in China&apos;s favour owing to support from Great  Britain. America, and  Japan,  she agreed to  evacuate by stages ; but, refusing  to  carry  out  her engagements,  she showed  that  she  intended  to remain permanently  in  Manchuria,  and  to strengthen her position  iu Korea.  The Russo-Japanese Avar was the immediate result of this policy (1904-5).     9. By  the  Treaty  of Portsmouth,  1905, Japan displaced  Russia  in  South Manchuria.     10. The Russo-British Convention of 1907 recognised the suzerainty of China over Tibet, and the special interest of Great Britain in that country.     11. Conventions were concluded in 1907 and 1910 between Russia and Japan with the object  of maintaining the status  quo in China and Manchuria.     12. Russo-Chinese frontier disputes ended by the Treaty of Tsitsihar,  1911.     13. In consequence of  attempts  by China to  tighten control over the Mongolias, the Mongols invited  Russian intervention in 1911..  After the Chinese revolution  the Mongols declared  independence; and  by the Urga Agreement (October .1912) Russia undertook to preserve Outer Mongol autonomy.  China protested.  The Ptusso-ChineseDeclaration of the 13th November, 1913, followed, in which the suzerainty of China o\rer      [1130]-546                                                     B
Outer  Mongolia  was recognised by  Russia.   The  Tripartite Treaty  of  Kiakhta(June 1915), signed by Russia, China, and Outer Mongolia, covered the whole field ofOuter Mongol relations&apos; with China, with  Russia, and  with other countries.   Anotherarrangement, completed  in  November  1915  between Russia  and China, placed theBartikh country (Barga) in a position similar to Outer Mongolia.     14. Towards the Chinese revolution  Russia, like the Western Powers, pursued apolicy of non-intervention.   But she showed that she did not like the republic, and upto the outbreak of the Great War she used  threats frequently to obtain her desires in manchuria and Mongolia.   After 1914 this attitude was less marked, and down to the fall of the Tsarist Government the  only transaction of importance affecting China was the russo--Japanese Treaty of 1916, in which both Powers  agreed to act together in theFar East.                               1. Early Relations.     From the beginning of the  sixteenth  century unsuccessful attempts had been made from West Siberia to establish relations with the  Chinese Court.  By the middle of theseventeenth  century, however, the Cossack  advance in  East Siberia  reached Chineseterritory,  and  encroachments  occurred which led  to  hostilities.    Kang-hsi  sentAmbassadors toNertchinsk (Nipchu), accompanied by the Jesuit  missionaries Gerbillonand Pereyra, and  there a treaty was concluded in the autumn of 1689 which set thelimits between  the  two dominions from  the Argun river to the sea.   By this treaty,the first contracted  by China with  any foreign  Power, the Russians were compelled  todismantle  their  fort at Albazin (Yaksa), and to retire behind the Argun and beyond theAmur watershed  and a reciprocal right to trade and travel was conceded to the subjects of both Empires.  Soon  afterwards Ysbrand Ides  and  others were sent by Peter theGreat  on  missions to Peking,  and arrangements were made with the consent of theChinese for  the presence of a  priest to minister to a  number  of Russian captives of pre-treaty days who were domiciled in that city.   Under the Treaty of Kiakhta  (whichwas  concluded  in 1727 to fix  the boundaries from the Argun westward through thefrontier mart of Kiakhta-Maimaichen to &quot; Chabinai dabagan,&quot;  and to  arrange for a freecommerce), the  abode  of  this priest became a hostel for Russian travellers ; a  churchwas  built near it; and relays of Russian students,  six  at a time, were maintained inthis  &quot; Ecclesiastical  Mission &quot; at the expense of the Chinese Government from the reignof Yung-cheng  to that of Hsien-feng, a period of over 130 years.  This treaty of 1727,with two more conventions of 1768  and 1792, regulated the  traffic  across the frontier,which  centred  at Kiakhta and was one of pure  barter.   At Kuldja  and  Tarbagatai,in the  far west of  the Chinese Empire, a  similar trade grew up  towards the  middleof the nineteenth century,  and the Kuldja Convention of the 25th July,  1851, was concluded to control it.                2.  The Russian Advance in East Siberia, 1847-1860.     In the beginning of  the nineteenth century the attention  of the  Russian Govern-ment was directed to the Amur, and an unsuccessful attempt seems to have been madeto obtain from the Chinese the right of using it to  facilitate communication  withOkhotsk and Kamschatka,  Later, when Count Muraviev became Governor-General otEast Siberia, from 1847 onward the river was explored without reference to China, andsettlements  were established  on its banks. In 1851 Nicolaevsk  and Mariinsk  werefounded, and in  1853 Alexandrovsk  and  Constantinovsk were  established on  thesea-coast;  all  in  territory which,  according  to  the  Treaty  of   Nertchinsk, wasunquestionably Chinese.   These encroachments, and  others arising  out of the needscreated by the Crimean War, were the subject of protest from  China, whose hands weretied by the T&apos;ai-p&apos;ing rebellion  and the disputes with Great Britain; and, finally, underpressure from  Muraviev, the  Treaty  of Aigun was  concluded (29th May, 1858)  to regularise the new conditions.   Under  this the whole of the north bank of the  Amur,from the Argun fork to the  sea, was  recognised as Russian ; the south bank down tothe  Ussuri as Chinese;  and the territory between the Ussuri  and the sea was  to  beheld in common, pending a settlement of the frontier.     An envoy, Count Putiatin, was also  sent overland to China in 1857, to negotiate a treaty dealing  with  the maritime trade, from which  up  to then  Russia had been expressly excluded.  Being  refused  permission  to  go to  Peking, he passed down  to hong Kong, and there joined the British, French, and American  envoys in pressing  for free intercourse.  When the Allies went north he  accompanied them, and was the first to sign a  treaty at  Tien-tsin (lst/13th June, 1858), the  important stipulation in  whichwas a most-favoured-nation  clause.   The ratifications of this treaty were exchanged at
Peking in May 1859, General Ignatiev being sent out overland for the purpose.   Afterthe rupture at Taku he remained on at Peking to urge the cession of the Trans-Ussuri.country amongst other things. In October I 8G0 he wrote to the French plenipotentiary,Baron Gros, that he had been advising the Chinese to come  to terms with the Allies,and at the same time he used his good offices to mitigate  the  demands of the latter.His  services  were evidently appreciated by the Chinese Government, because on the14th November, three weeks after the signing of the British and French  conventions,he concluded another by which the Ussuri territory was ceded to  Russia.                 3. Kuldja and the Treaty of St.&apos;Petersburg, 1881.     The Mohammedan rising in Kashgar led by Yakub Beg, the Atalik Ghazi, provokedthe local intervention of Russia, by whose troops the Kuldja (Hi) Valley was  occupied in 1871  under a promise to return it when  Chinese authority was  restored.   By 1877all this region  was  reconquered  in the campaigns of Tso Tsung-fang.  Only Kuldjaremained.  Russia showing  no  disposition  to  restore it, a special  envoy was  sent  toSt. Petersburg, and by the so called Treaty ofLivadia (September  1879) China recoveredthe greater part of the  occupied territory  on  payment  of 5,000,000 roubles  to  covercost of the occupation.  The terms of this treaty roused  a violent opposition in Chinaand  for a time there  was some danger of a  serious breach with  Russia.   Anotherenvoy, the Marquis Tseng, was sent from London to  St.  Petersburg, and he concludedanother treaty which was  ratified in August 1881.  This appeared to be less objection-able, though in effect the  territorial  arrangements of the Livadia Treaty seem to havebeen little altered.  Russia remained in possession of a part of the Hi valley.           4. Guarantee of Russia not to Occupy Korean Territory, 1886.     There is little to notice in Russo-Chinese  relations from this date up to the close of the Chino-Japanese War  (1894-5).  The occupation  of Port Hamilton, which wasKorean territory,  by a British naval force in May 1885, to forestall  Russian  action  onthe coast of Korea, was made the subject of protest by China.   The Russian  government having promised  China that  they  &quot; would not occupy Korean territory under any circumstances whatever,&quot; China gave a guarantee to Great Britain  that no  part  of korea would  be surrendered  to another Power, and the islands were evacuated on the27th February, 1887.                   5. Retrocession of Liaotung (Kuantung), 1895.     By the Treaty of Shimonoseki China ceded  a portion of South Manchuria, knownas Liaotung or Kuantung,  to Japan.  There  had  been for some years a current  ofopinion that the ice-free port in  East Asia which Russia was in  search of was to  befound in the territory thus handed  over to  Japan.  At all events, in  the  interval between the signing and the ratification of  the Shimonoseki  Treaty, Russia invited theGreat Powers to intervene to preserve South  Manchuria to  China, on the  ground thatthe occupation of  Port Arthur  by Japan would &quot; destnty the political balance of theFar East.&quot;  France and Germany fell in with this view, but Great  Britain declined to do so.     In May 1895, Russia, France,  and Germany made joint representations to Japanrecommending her not to occupy permanently  the territory mentioned, and indicationswere given that the advice,  if unheeded, would be supported by force of arms.   Japanyielded  to this  coalition,  and,   in  a  Convention  of  the  8th  November,  1895,retroceded the districts in  question, receiving in compensation a money payment of30,000,000 taels.  The motives of Russia and France were plain.  Russia did not wishto have a strong and progressive nation in  possession of lands adjacent to her ownfrontiers, and  especially lands which  she herself coveted; and France lent support asRussia s ally.  But those  of Germany were not  so  clear, and it did not transpire tilllater that the German Emperor&apos;s main purpose was to prevent Japan from obtaining&apos;the means of raising huge  armies of Chinese and becoming a serious &quot; yellow peril.&quot;                           6. Lease of Port Arthur, 1898.     The three intervening  Powers  were naturally  for a time looked upon as China&apos;sfriends.  In return for her services Russia was given the right  to carry her siberian railway across North Manchuria from Stretensk to Vladivostock and  thus commence
the peaceful penetration of this  magnificent country; and she  increased her hold onChina  by guaranteeing a 4-per-cent. loan  of 15,000,0001. in Paris to enable China topay the first installnent of the Japanese indemnity.  It is further said that a secrettreaty,  known  as the  &quot; Cassini  Convention,&quot;  but more probably an  understandingnegotiated in Russia by Li Hung-Chang, provided for assistance  to China, and gaveRussia the right to occupy Port Arthur and Kiaochow under cerrain circumstances.     In 1896 an official  statement was  made in the Reichstag that Germany had cometo an understanding with  Russia on their respective interests in China;  in  November1897, Germany landed a force from her fleet to occupy Kiaochow, and while  China  andGermany  were negotiating,  the  Russian  fleet was sent  to winter  at  Port Arthur(December  1897).   When two British cruisers  put  in  there  in  January  1898,  theRussian Ambassador in London was instructed to request  their withdrawal, &quot; in orderto avoid friction in the Russian sphere of influence.&quot;     In March  1898, when the German Convention was signed, a demand for a similarlease of Port Arthur and Ta-lien Wan was put forward  to  China by Russia.   A sharpcorrespondence ensued  between the  British and  Russian Governments.   The BritishGovernment were not opposed to &quot; the lease by Russian of  an ice-free commercial portconnected by rail  with the Trans-Siberian Railway,&quot; but pointed out that  &quot; questions ofan entirely different  kind were opened if Russia  obtained  control of  a  military portin the neighbourhood  of  Peking,&quot; and that the  occupation of Port Arthur &quot;would inevitably  be considered in   the  East as  a standing  menace to  Peking and  thecommencement of the partition of China.&quot;  China, being unable  to resist  it,  acquiesced in the demand, and the British  Government received assurances that &quot;the  RussianGovernment had  no intention of  infringing  the  rights and privileges guaranteed by existing treaties between  China and foreign countries,&quot; and that  no interference withChinese sovereignty was proposed.   By an agreement  of the 27th March, 1898, PortArthur, Ta-lien Wan  (Dalny, Dairen) and adjacent territory,  all of  which had beenretroceded by Japan in  1895,  were leased to Russia for twenty-five years.                     7. Russo-Brilish Railway Agreement,  1899.    After the Chino-Japanese war the advantages of railways were for the first timeopenly recognised in China,    In the  spring of 1898, when a loan was being negotiatedwith a British  bank for railway construction in Manchuria, the Russian representative in Peking demanded that the British engineer should be replaced by a  Russian,  andobjected to the railways in question  being mortgaged to British  subjects.  The BritishGovernment took the  matter up strongly at Peking and at St. Petersburg,  and in theend the British railway loan was carried through.   At the same  time  a  general agree-ment  was  concluded between Great Britain  and Russia on the. 29th  April,  1899, inwhich the former  engaged  -    &quot; not to seek for  her  own account, or on behalf of British subjects  or others,  any  .  railway concessions to the north  of the Great Wall of  China,  and not to obstruct,    directly or indirectly, applications for railway concessions in  that region supported    by the Russian Government&quot; ;while Russia, on her part, gave an identical undertaking vis-a-vis railway concessions&quot; in  the  basin  of Yangtsze,&quot; and applications for railway  concessions in that regionsupported by the  British Government.                         8.  Russia  and Manchuria, 1900-5.    In  the Boxer outbreak  of 1900 Russia was  involved more  than any other foreign power.   The anti-foreign movement had in effect been  confined to North China,  and outside the valley  of the  Pei Ho the missionaries  bore the  brunt of it.  Elsewherethroughout China Proper, peace was  preserved,  in spite of  the Peking decrees orderinghostilities  against foreign  nations, by enlightened Viceroys and  Governors;  but in manchuria the  Governors were not so judicious, and, obeying the decrees,  declared  war on the Russians in June 1900.  Their sudden attacks created a  panic along  the Amur,and led to savage reprisals, the Chinese population of Blagovestchensk, some 5,000 men,women and children, being  driven into the river at  the outset.  The  Chinese  forces were easily  overcome and the whole of Manchuria  was occupied by Russian troops.     In the discussions of the international  conference at Peking in 1900-1 Russiadisassociated herself from some of the demands of  the&apos;other  Powers, though claiming an indemnity out  of proportion to the services of her troops, and endeavoured to establish
the view that her limitrophe position entitled her to conduct independent negotiations in her  own  interests.  This  attitude  was explained by  the position  of affairs  in manchuria.   Soon  after  the country  was overrun by Russian troops proclamationswere  issued which  amounted to declarations  of conquest.  Towards the end of 1900agreements  concluded  between  Russian agents and the Manchu governors came  to light, by which  the  three provinces of Manchuria were placed under Russian control.There  were  also negotiations  at St.  Petersburg with the Chinese  Minister for theconclusion of a formal convention, which would constitute a Russian protectorate overManchuria and  give  exclusive or preferential rights throughout Mongolia and ChineseTurkestan (New Dominion).   Some of the leading Powers advised China to abstain from separate negotiations with one nation while the^joint conference was proceeding  at peking, and Great Britain and Japan pressed for definite information at St. Petersburgas to the precise tenour of the proposed convention.   The Chinese opposition, too, was strong.   Eventually the Chinese Minister at St. Petersburg was instructed to refuse hissignature, and  on the 6th August, 1901, the  Russian Government issued an officialcommunique stating that  their  objects  and intentions having been misrepresented theconvention was temporarily dropped.    Nevertheless Russia in no  way relaxed her grip  on Manchuria, and it was wellunderstood after  the Anglo-Japanese Alliance (January 1902) was  announced that japan  at least  was not disposed to acquiesce tamely in a permanent occupation.  TheFinal Protocol of September 1901 having left the  matter  outstanding, Russia renewednegotiations with the Chinese early in 1902.  She  abandoned some of the demands which had been objected to previously, and  on  the 8th April,  1902, an agreement was signed at Peking which provided for the evacuation of Manchuria by stages in eighteen months.  That the terms were so moderate was due to the support given to China by great  Britain, Japan, and (America.  It was soon apparent that  they did not satisfy the Russian  Government.   The first  stage  of the evacuation  was carried out at the agreed date, October 1902 ; but when  it appeared that  in.  the negotiations of japan and America for the commercial treaties stipulated in the Final Protocol  of 1901 threenew ports were to be  opened &quot;by China1 in Manchuria, Russia refused to execute thesecond  programme  of evacuation until  further  demands, designed  to rivet  Russiancontrol on the country to the exclusion  of all other foreign influences, were conceded.Further, in August 1903 a ukase was issued creating a Vice-Regency of the Amur andKuantung territories, with Admiral Alexeiev as Viceroy, and this was interpreted to mean a resumption of the forward policy.    Great Britain, Japan and the United States  again stiffened the Chinese to refuse the fresh demands, and representations were made by all three Powers at  St. Peters-burg.   China being unable to press matters to a practical conclusion, Japan went to thefront and made definite proposals at St. Petersburg  designed to reconcile the interestsof Japan and Russia  in Manchuria and Korea, to guarantee the territorial integrit)r ofChina and Korea, and to maintain the  open door in both those countries.  No seriousattempt was made by Russia to meet the Japanese advances.  During the negotiationsRussia collected  imposing forces  in Manchuria,  no doubt for the purpose  of overawingJapan ;  but Japan was not deterred, and preferred war to  a renunciation of her positionin East Asia.                        9. The Treaty of Portsmouth, 1905.    Throughout the Russo-Japanese  War,  China, in  whose  territory it was foughtalmost entirely, maintained neutrality, and after the Treaty of Portsmouth was signed(5th September, 1905). another treaty was concluded at Peking (22nd December, 1905),in which China consented  to the transfer and  assignments  made  to  Japan by Russia.By these Japan  displaced  Russia in South Manchuria ;  Russia retained her railwayzone in North Manchuria ; and  the practical effect so far as China was concerned wasthat she had two Powers to deal with instead of one.                 10. Tibet and the Russo-British Convention of 1907.    It was ascertained at  the  time  of  the discussions arising  out  of the Russianoccupation of Manchuria that the Dalai Lama was intriguing with the Russian Govern-ment  through a  Buriat  Mongol named DorjiefF.  The Younghusband. expedition  of1903-4 was undertaken  to  bring the Tibetans  directly to account.   A  British forceentered Lhasa,  where  a  Convention was signed  (7th  September,  1904).   Chinainterposed as suzerain, and by a  Convention signed at Peking  (27th  April, 1906) theLhasa  Convention  was confirmed.   This  Adhesion Convention  was followed  by an       [1130]-546                                                      C
arrangement between  Great Britain and Russia, recorded  in a  Convention  signed  at st.. Petersburg (31st August, 1907), in which the suzerain rights of  China over  Tibetwere recognised by both Governments,and. it was agreed &quot;that Great Britain by reasonof her geographical position has a special interest in the maintenance of the status quoin the external  relations of Tibet.&quot;   While recognising the relations and engagementsrecorded in the Lhasa Convention of 1904, and the Adhesion  Convention of  1906,Russia and Great Britain undertook (1) to respect the territorial integrity of Tibet andto abstain from interference in the internal administration; (2) to treat with Tibet only through the intermediary of the Chinese Government;  (3) not to send  representatives to Lhasa; (4) not to seek concessions  of any kind in  Tibet; and (5) not to acquire anylien on Tibetian revenues.   In an exchange of notes of the same date the two Govern-ments agreed to forbid scientific expeditions from either country to Tibet for a term ofthree years, and to  approach the Chinese  Government for the purpose of obtaining asimilar  engagement from  them.  At  the close of the three  years term they were tocome to an agreement, should occasion arise, as to the  &quot; ulterior measures to be takenconcerning scientific expeditions to Tibet.&quot;1.1.  Russo-Japanese Conventions for the Maintenance  of the status quo in  China and                            Manchuria, 1907 and 1910.    Amongst other agreements concluded by Japan with Russia in 1907 was one signed on the 30th July at St. Petersburg for the maintenance of the status quo and support ofthe principle of the open door for commerce and industry in China.    A proposal put forward by the  American Government in November 1909 to GreatBritain, France, Germany,  Russia, Japan, and  China, for the  neutralisation of therailways in Manchuria, with the ultimate object of securing that that  country should bea neutral area for economic  enterprise, was opposed by Russia&apos;and Japan.   This attitude was  followed  by the conclusion of  another  convention  between these two Powers(4th July, 1910),  in  which, alter declaring their adherence  to the principles of theprevious convention of the 30th July,  1907, they agreed to work together in Manchuriaon railway questions,  and  to maintain the status  quo in Manchuria  resulting  fromtreaties and other arrangements concluded up to date between  Japan and Russia, or between -either  of  them  and  China.  Copies  of the aforesaid  arrangements  wereexchanged between  Japan and Russia.                    12, Russo-Chinese Treaty of Tsitsihar, 1911.    From the Russo-Japanese war  onward China had been disposed to treat Russianaffairs with little consideration.   Disputes with regard to the long frontier accumulated,and a series of demands were made by Russia at Peking to secure the full enjoyment of the 1881 treaty, which, according to Russia, had been practically abrogated.   Afterlong discussions an ultimatum was  delivered by  Russia on the 24th  March, 1911, andthe controversy closed by a  note of the Wai-wu Pu  accepting  the  Russian demandscompletely and unequivocally.  A treaty was signed at Tsitsihar in  Manchuria on the20th December, 1911, delimiting a portion of the frontier in North Mongolia.                        13.  Russia  and Mongolia, 1911-15.    The steps  taken by the Peking Government in the closing years of Kuang-hsii toreduce the Mongolian more to the status of Chinese provinces antagonised the Mongols.The unrest thus created increased during Hsuan-t&apos;jung&apos;s  reign and came to a head in1911.  In July of that year a meeting of Mongol princes at Urga, presided over by theKhutukhtu (Lama  Pope of Mongolia), sent a deputation to St. Petersburg to ask for russia&apos;s protection.  Russia undertook to make representations at  Peking.  Accordingly,on the  28th August, the Russian Minister  presented a note to the Wai-wu Pu statingthat Russia could not remain indifferent  to  any violent change  in  the  status  quo inMongolia, and pointing out that the measures of the Chinese Government were disturb-ing the existing balance of power on the frontier, and were exercising an unfavourableinfluence on the relations between the two Governments.  To this the Wai-wu Pu replied(19th September) that the measures  of reform in progress in Mongolia had merely forobject  the commercial and industrial development of the  country, and that the UrgaAmban had been instructed to pay regard to Mongol sentiment.  &apos;  But the revolution in China soon afterwards led the Mongol princes  to declaretheir independence at Urga.  The Amban was forced  to withdraw and the  Khutukhtu
was appointed Great Khan  of the Mongols.   Russia was appealed to for support: sheadvised the Mongols to show moderation and to endeavour to find a basis of agreementwith China&apos;.   The Mongols, however,  conducted offensive measures against China, andon the abdication of the Mancbus questions  arose amongst  them as to the positions  ofInner and Outer Mongolia under the new regime.   Both the Mongols and the Chineseapproached the Russian Government, who had offered to mediate.  Russia suggested  to-China  as a basis for a settlement that there should  be no Chinese administrators  inMongolia, no Chinese  troops  sent  there, and no  colonisation by  Chinese;  and at thesame time the Mongols were recommended not to sever connection with China.  Inspite of this mediation the Mongols continued their aggressions.    The period of disorder was brought to an end by an agreement concluded at Urga(12th  October, 1912) between a Russian envoy, M. Korostovetz, and plenipotentiaries&quot; duly authorised by the Sovereign of  the Mongol people, by the Mongol Government,and by the governing  princes.&quot; The preamble stated that, &quot; following a  unanimousdesire of the Mongols to maintain the national and historic constitution of their country,the Chinese  troops and  authorities ,were obliged to evacuate Mongol territory, andCheptsun Dampa  Khutukhtu  was proclaimed Sovereign of the Mongol people.  Theancient relations between  Mongolia and China thus  came to  an  end.&quot;   The RussianGovernment undertook to assist Mongolia to preserve the  autonomy thus established and the right to have a national army, and to forbid the presence  of Chinese troops  orcolonisation by Chinese on Mongol  territory.    In a protocol annexed to this agreementelaborate arrangements were made giving Russian subjects complete liberty of trade  inMongolia free of &quot; duties, taxes, or other dues,&quot; and other special privileges.    The Korostovetz Agreement was resented strongly by China, and there was sometalk of sending a force to Urga.  After long  discussions with the Russian government there was a declaration and an exchange of notes at Peking (November 1913).   In thedeclaration Russia recognised the suzerainty  of China  over Outer Mongolia, and  China,on her side, recognised the autonomy of Outer Mongolia:  in  the exchange  of notesRussia  recognised  that  Outer  Mongolia &quot; formed part of the  territory of China.&quot;Following these arrangements  of .1912  and  1913 railway  and telegraph agreements were concluded  between  Russia and  Outer  Mongolia  (30th  September,  1914),  whichestablished Russia&apos;s preferential position in these matters.    The political status  of  Outer  Mongolia (which  must  throughout  be  clearlydistinguished from Inner Mongolia) as it was laid down by the  Korostovetz agreement and by the Russo-Chinese  engagements of the 5th November,  1913, was consolidatedby &quot;a tripartite treaty signed at  Kiakhta (7th June, 1915) by representatives of Russia,China, and Outer Mongolia.  This comprehensive document covers  the whole field ofthe Outer Mongol relations  with the  suzerain, China, with Russia,  and with  othercountries.   Outer  Mongolia  recognised  the 1913 declaration  and the suzerainty  ofChina; Russia and China recognised the autonomy  of Outer  Mongolia.   The latter was declared not to possess the  right to conclude treaties with foreign Powers concerningpolitical and territorial questions, but  was conceded the right  to  contract treaties ofcommerce and industry.     Shortly afterwards (26th November, 1915), another arrangement  was concludedbetween Russia and China  &quot;on the subject of the  Houlounbouir situation.&quot;  This refers to the Bariikh country, which is called by the Russians Bargha or Barga, and by theChinese Hulun-Buir,  after the  two  Mongol lakes.   It occupies  an enclave betweenManchuria,  the Argun River,  and Outer Mongolia,  is inhabited  by nomads  of theMongol  type, and  contains two stations  on the Trans-Siberian  railway, Hailar andManchuria, which had been opened  to foreign trade by the Sino-Japanese AdditionalAgreement of the 22nd December, 1905.   It appears that  the Barukhs  had declaredthemselves independent in the  early  part of 1912.  The district  was brought &quot;underthe control of the central government of the Chinese Republic,&quot; but with  restrictions,the effect of which  was to place the Barukh country in a position similar  to OuterMongolia, and under the special protection of Russia.                   14. Russia and the Chinese Republic, 1911-16.     At the  founding of the  Chinese Republic  Russia&apos;s policy,  like that of  all theWestern Powers, was one of non-intervention.  But  her relations during the first twoyears were none too friendly.   The Russian attitude in  Manchuria, where disputes werefrequent, was unsympathetic.   Ultimata and threats of force were frequently employed at Peking to support  political demands, especially in connection  with the Mongolianaffairs  sketched  above.  Redress  for minor corn plaints being delayed  by  China, a
concentration  of  some 7,000  troops, it  is  said, took place at Tsitsihar:  this  dernon-stration was effectual, for the  Russian demands are reported to have  been concededwithin a day  or two.  From the  outbreak  of the Great  War * this  attitude was lessmarked and the only  outstanding  transaction affecting China, down to the fall of theTsarist Government was a treaty with Japan (3rd July, 1916) in which the two countriesagreed to act together in defence of their territorial rights and special interests in theFar East.o
