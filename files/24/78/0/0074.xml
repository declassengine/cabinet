It is to-? earlyyet to estimate the extent of the damage to fruit trees, though it is certain that general delay to farming operations will have been caused.In the early part of the week good progress had been made withcultivation, sowing of spring corn and planting of early potatoes.There is a soarcity of hay and roots in some districts.

These are being dealt with as indicated below:-                                                                 aor, s,     Declined, before or  after  inspection   77 offers representing 5,623     Further particulars  awaited           25   &quot;       &quot;       6,84P     Referred  to  Commission, rs  for                    inspection              31   &quot;       &quot;      11,P62     Referred  by  Comiiission&apos; rs  of County     Councils as orima facie suitable      12   &quot;       &quot;       1,370     7ithdravm                           _2   11       &quot;      _800                                         147                   29,503
     Farm Settlement a administer^a, by the Board.                         The area acqvired for administration by  theBoard itself as Farm Settlements *i3 12,267 acres.    There  are now 115   service men working on then;   a further 34 have been  accepted  asprobationers but have not yet started work.          The chief work during  the we. k at Kclbeach has consistedin drilling oats and barley.   150 acres of oats&quot;  52 acres of barley and 14 acres of flax have now been sown.          Potato planting has progressed satisfactorily  at Amosburyand it is hoped that this will be completed this week,          At Pairington the spring work is getting on satisfactorily,the&apos;winter crops,  though backward,  : look  &apos;  well,   satisfactory progress is also being made with spring work at Pembrey, and 45acres cf oats have now been drilled.   At Holieston oats have beensown during the week and work is being carried out cn dykes andhedges.     Heath Hill.   Horses have chiefly been employed on  rolling winterwheat and winter oats.   Owing to the very cold nights crops arebackward and are not making much progress.   All potatoes of lastytar&apos;s crcp have now been disposed of.                       (ii) Local Organisation.     Determination of .Tenancies.   The Board have  during the past  weekissued Ot-ders determining &quot;tenancies on account of  bad farming of  two small pieces of land (2 acres and 3 acres), situate respectively  at  Neston in Cheshire and at St.  Allen in Cornwall.     Cultivation of Farms.   The Executive Committee for Cornwall havebeen authorised to take&quot;possession of 14 acres of  land situate atPerranzabulce .   The owner has another farm at some little distanceand is evidently incapable of farming so much land properly, asreports which have been received by the Board on the holding inquestion unanimously describe it as disgracefully  neglected and practically derelict.   The Committee will let the land  to an efficient tenant.                      (i i i) Prqvis ion of Allotments.          The Little Coates Parish Council desired in January last totale-- up a further 7 acres of land for allotments.    The  land wasinspected by on-,, cf the Board&apos;s  Inspectors and r*: commended.   Theown:r&apos;s agent demurred.   An application was accordingly made by  the parish Council to the Lindsey Agricultural Executive Committee for compulsory entry under Regulation 211.   But the matter has now been satisfactorily arranged ty private treaty, and rather more land than was previously asked for has been let to tho Council.          To meet  the unsatisfied demand for allotments in Southsea,Denbighshire, the Board&apos;s Small  Holdings Commissioner far Wales hassecured    acres of land from the Plao Power Colliery Company withimmediate possession, the landlords undertaking to deal with thesitting tenant.          The  Pewiok PariBh Council (Worcestershire) brought to  thenotice of the rsoard tho proposed sale by public auction of 3:1 acres ofland held by tho Council for the past 20 years for allotments.   TheBoard arranged with the County Council tc bid for  tho land, but unfortunately the Council were outbid at tho auction.                            (iv) Land Drainage,     Employment of Prisoners of War,   At present  approximately 2,450prisoners are employed cn cleansing watercourses  in different parts ofof the country, and of this number about 1,075 are employed on the River
louse and various waterways in the Pen country, 1,130 are employed freeicf charge, and application  has &quot;been made for payment to be dispensedi fith for a further 194.   There prisoner labour has been given free cf charge, riparian owners in many cases provide tools and supervision. in ether cases the cost of these will, it&apos; is hoped, be re-covered from drainage authorities.   Camps have been sanctioned for the accommodation ef a further 1,400 prisoners, tc be employed mainly an the Ouso and its tributaries, but in the present unoertainty as t- the dis- posal of prisncrs  f war, it is, rivt proposed to provide tools for theiriuse until they actually arrive at the camps.      County Drainage Committees .   Committer: s have now been established under section 17 of the Act oT&quot;l91P in 22 Counties, and orders are being inadt! for 3 more counties.   In certain counties where considerable drainage work is required, difficulty is being experienced in obtaining the services of a properly qualified drainage surveyor to prepare schemes for the purposes cf section 16 of the Act.   Several such schemes  arc, however, in course cf preparation and two (one in Somersetshire and one in Bedfordshire) Jiavc been deposited for the receipt of objections.      Formation of new Districts.   Under Part I of the Aot tho preparation of maps&quot; and drafting orders for the formation of new drainage autharities to control large and important drainage areas is proceeding.   The chief cf such areas are the valleys of tho Great Ouse, the Wavency and ether Norfolk Riversr the Chelmer and Essex Blackwator, the Yorkshire Ouse, Dee, Clv/yd, Upper Severn, Lugg, Hampshire Avon and Stour, the &quot;Wey and liole, and the Loddon and its tributaries.      Proposed dredging cf the Lower Ouse.   The need, of dredgers on the River Ouse and its tributaries is very pressing.   If the grant which has been applied for from the Development Commission is sanctioned promptly it is hoped that the second-hand dredgers may be got to work very shortly and that at least cne new one will be delivered in July.                             Commercial Division.           Building Section,      Architectural Aesi-stance for County Councils.   Replies to the  . Board&quot;&apos;s Circular Letter C .L. 133/C .5 of March ISth are coming in very slowly.   Somerset County Council has advertised for a whole-time architect.   A few Counties have submitted the names of their County Land Agents, and the Board will be able to approve &quot;their employment. One Council about to embark on large schemes proposed to employ a builder at a remuneration of 2/- per hour  for this work.   His plans, when submitted, proved highly unsuitable,  and the Council has been invited to submit an alternative proposal.   In a few cases the County Architect has been approved after examination of plans submitted hy him.      Faisal I Cottage Holdings.&apos;  The Council has secured  some excellent ground  on which it is proposed  to lay out  20 cottage-holdings of one acre each:       Preliminary sketches for  cottages for north and south aspect  have boen submitted.   Those for north aspect, estimated to cost  694 each&apos; have been generally approved. The others  estimated to cost 5656 each, are referred  for further consideration  in regard to cost. An officer of  the Board  is at 7a3 sail this week, in  order to discuss economics with the Borough Officials.      Experimental Cotta^e- 3ui;lding,   &apos; Negotiations with  the Department cf Scientific&quot; and Induitfiai&quot; Re sear oh have been completed by which that Department and the Board jointly will build &quot;at Ames bury  a number ef -experimental  octtages, of Pise&apos;, rammed  chalk and other local materials, *che employment of which  has fallen cut  cf  use during the period of very cheap brick-making.   H.K. Office of 7orks have agreed that the rule that they shall provide  all buildings on the Beard&apos;s Estates  shall be  set aside in  this case.   As soon as the Land Division has selected the  sites at Amesbury, the experimental cottages will bo put  in hand.

On  the completionof the cottage, the  hut would be available for use ae a farm building.           ffertllirorn,            A provisional Agreeiceiffb haa been reaohel with the  Sulphateef Ammonia Manufacturers whereby  they undertake to reserve 36,009 tonssf Sulphate ef Ammonia for  sale to Manure  ICbcers during the four months,June-September, at the price  of  19 per tin with a &quot;fall&quot; clauseproviding  for a possible reduction of this pride to  17,  in the eventof prioes  falling to that level after September,   The manufacturersalso undertake to reserve 5iOQ0 tons for  eale to farmers  for immediateapplication to the land in  tha  same period, at  17 per ton.    Subject tothe reservation of these quantities, the  balance of  the production willbe exported^  - The average  pries whioh has1 bean received  Toy the makers?during  the season 1918-19,  after  taking  into account the  (knrernmentsubsidy, has been over   2$  per  ton,  so that these prioes  are ^elowcurrent  rates, and it has  only  been possible to  indues makerA  te  agreeto them in consideration  of the unrestricted export  of the balance,  Thequestion of the price at which  this  fertiliser Is te to  sold during  thoremainder  of tho  season will  bo discussed later  en*            The  stock of  phosphate  reck  whioh will be  transferred frwr-the  ministry  of Munitions  to fertiliser  manufacturers  ftn funs  1st what.the  contrsl  ceases,  will  amount to  approximately  305,000 tons,  ef whie^112,000 tans will be aotually in  this  country.    The balance,  namely %y193.000 tons,  is  represented &quot;by Contractb whioh will be  assigned  tc  th0Fertiliser Manufacturers1  Association..    Assuming  that  no difficulty ismet  with by  the makers  in lifting this balance  from N.  Afrioa,  the supply., is  ample to  meet  needs  for acme considerable  time  to come and  tha Superphosphate  Makers will hame ample  time to  adjust themselves to saw conditions and  tt make  freoh contracts,           Binder  Twine.             The  demand far Binder Twine in this oauntry  oontinues tf Wvery small and  dealers  and farmers show little disposition to buy.   m view of the  very marked fall whioh has taken plaoe  in the price of hsrrp, namely from  100  per ton at the date of the Armistice to about  45 per ton at the present time,  advantage has been taken af an  opportunity to soil the binder twine in the possession of the Board for export and 2,00$  tons hare been disposed of in this way,    The sale of the atooksheld by the  Board may have a beneficial influence&quot; on the demand at it has  been asserted by makers that  farmers and dealers will not Vuy owing to  the expectation that their needs will ultimately be prsvlded far by the Board.           Marketing.-             The Sugar Commission has allocated 1.000 tens &amp;f sugar to the  Department for distribution amongst Fruit and Vegetable Societies
 for the purpose of jam making.   This will enable co-operative jam making to be continued in certain centres where it proved successful last year.           Transport,             There is a rery appreciable demand for improved transport facilities in rural districts and agricultural bodies of all kinds naturally look to the Board to further their  interests.   It seems very desirable therefore that the Board should be given eome advisory powers in the Bill establishing tho Ministry  of Ways and Communicationc, A suggestion nan seen made to Sir Sric Geddes to that effect*           Wart Disease,             Preparations are being made for the inspection ff growing orops cf immune varieties in England and Wales with a view to the issuing of a certificate where the crops are  considered te reaoh a sufficient degree of purity to make them suitable for &quot;seed&quot;,           Ssed Oats.             Shipments of sesd oats for France are now completed and a small consignment, not exceeding 1,200 tons, is being prepared for shipment to JSsthonia,           Testing of Seeds Order,             Up to the present 2,260  seed firms in England and Wales have been visited,  some on three  or  four coeaaions, by Inspectors under the Order,    There are  still a fow small firms who plead ignorance of the requirements of  the Order but on the whole it is being complied with in a satisfactory manner.   In only a few isolated instances, have firms oomplained  that the Order is irksome cr unworkable and these oases have been found to be due to misinterpretation of the regulations.                          Horticultural Division.itiration  Section,I           A joint meeting ef  the  National  Fruit Trades Association,! the Lcndon Fruit and Vegetable Markets Association, and the british   Florists Federation was attended  on  Wednesday, the 23rd Instant, withI reference to the proposals  of the Railway  Clearing House for the adequate protection of packages containing Fruit and Vegetables, and1 with the object  of  preventing loss by pilfering and damage while in] transit,      Huntingdonshire.  The  formation of  a  Horticultural Sub-Committee  is  in progress,  and names  of  suitable fruit  growers and market gardeners have been submitted to  the Agricultural  Committee,   It has also been decided to co-opt  the Boards  Inspectors for advisoryj purposes,!      Norfolk.  A visit was  paid to Mr.  Welchman^s  farm at  Terrington!  to  investigate the  hark disease  of Apple Trees  already  reported,   Mr,I Brooks  of  Cambridge University  is cf opiniija that  the  disease  isI  encouraged by  unfavourable  conditions of cultivation  and  suggestsj  that excessive moisture  causes  immature  sappy growth which is  attaokedI  by  a parasitic fungus which he  is at present unable to  name.   He1  suggests draining the  land  to see if it  will check the  trouble,1      Gloucester.-    A visit  was  paid  to  the  Secretary  of  theI Horticultural  Sub-Committee and Agricultural Organiser  for the County1 in  order  to  discuss and prepare  a scheme for Horticultural Organisation  of  the  County,I     Bee-keeping.    Favourable  reports  have  been received from aI number  of  counties  as  to  the wicospread interest  which  is  being  takenI in bee-keeping,  due in a  large  measure  to  the Board&apos;o  action in

Applieation8 for training in poultry farming are still    being received from ex-service men,   A number of poultry farmers have    teen asked if they are able to undertake the training of ex-service    men on their farms, and to let the Board have particulars regarding    terms, and period cf instruction.   In this way it is hcpo  to bo    able to place a number of men on farms, where they will receive at    least their board and lodging as well as their instruction in payment    for full services, ^ Dunstan&apos; 8,   A report has now been obtained of the training farm at    King&apos;s Langley;  accommodation is provided at present for 6 blind    students but it would be quite possible to accommodate 12,   Thero    are suitable buildings for incubator shed, granary, stable and trap    house, and storage, also good piggeries,   The land is well suited for    poultry keeping;  13^ acres are at present occupied, while an    additional 23 acroe of grass adjoining are likely to be available.             The main objeet of this farm is the provision ef stook and    equipment for the men when plaeed on holdings after concluding their    training.   The practical training only extends over one month,  6    men being taken at a time and only a small section *tf the equipment is    placed at their disposal for praotioal purposes,   Fowls and rabbits    are reared in large numbers while a few pigs are kept for killing    as required fsr St, Dunstan&apos;s.             The Superintendent is a poultry farmer of leng standing    and considerable experience.             If considered desirable the teaching of poultry keeping to    a small number of ex-service men  (with sight) might be carried out    here with some further addition to the equipment for the demonstration    Of methods suitable for small holdings as distinct from the &quot;business    of breeding stock for distribution as now carried on, ITechnical and Cultivation Division,  ihnieal Section,        Plant Diseases.  A summary has  seen prepared of reports received    during jarch from Honorary Plant Disease  Correspondents of the Technical    Committee,   One correspondent refers to  an investigation made  into    the winter wastage of wheat  in 3ast  Shropshire,   Slugs and cutworms    are stated to be the ohief eauses  of damage.   As regards potatoes,    decay  in clamps continues to be reported,   A clamp  of 60 tons  of    King JMward on sne farm in Durham rotted  and fell in, the tubers  in    this ease having been lifted after frost.   Those lifted before frest    remained sound in the clamp.   Templar, however, lifted after frost    kept well.   In Berkshire, Phytophthora  is prevalent especially in.i   clamps  of Arran Chief and Lang&apos;s  Imperial, but Templar and i^ueen Mary 9  are keeping well.   Potatoes grown in 1918 sn a freshly-broken pasture 1  field  in Kent were  sadly damaged  by wireworms, as many as twenty-nine I  being  counted  in two tubers,   flax grown on one corner ef the  field 1  was not attacked, thsugh wireworms  swarmed there.   Damage to Peas by  j  the apMd ;*iacrosiphumyis 1 appears  to have been seritus in some  \  districts in 1918.   jSvidence was  forthcoming that when the seeding I  was early  (grey peas sown end  of  January  in one case) no damage was I  done.,  but later sown crops suffered badly.   It is presumed that  this I  is due .to &quot;the late  sown plants being net  so forward  in growth at  the
time the aphis migrate from the clover.    In districts  where  theaphis is abundant and there is much clover ley,  it is doubtful  if  itis worth while having a late-sown orop.    Attention is  called to thf,value of sulphate of aluminium for use against slugs,    Contaot isessential,  but a particle of not more than a milligram  or two sufficesto kill a medium-sized slug.   The efficacy of the chemical extend to 1:: 1000 when dissolved in water, though spraying with a strengthef 1 : 500 is recommended at dusk on warm wot days whon slugs areaotive.

The  number of  soldiers remaining on farms at the  end of  &quot;the&quot; week was 23,045,  the  total  number  demobilised  since the  date of the Armistice being  49,006.            The  withdrawal  of  th- se men  from the land for re-turn to  military  duty  has  new commenced  and if the return of the whole of -the men is insisted upon very  serious  consequences to agriculture  will result.   ; any of the men are  &quot;pivotal&quot;  and absolutely  indispensable  and  their  names  v,ould have  been  included in the  Iivoted List,  but  for the improbability that  hostilities having  ceased, they ^ould be required back for military duty.    Strong  representations have been made to  the  War Office that a percentage  of  the  men should  be demobilised instead  of being recalled to military  duty,  especially,  as only about  70)* of the &quot;pivotal&quot; men  for  agriculture have so far  been released,  and the Linistry of Labour are  unable-  to furnish  substitutes  for  the  men who  are being withdrawn.

Although it  is estimated that 5,000 additional  women rill  be  required  for the Land Amy this season, it is the policy  of the  Board  only to  enrol when an-: where the demand exists.   Seasonal  labour other  than  vomen  living in  the  localities and those in the  V/omenVs Land  Amy  vill be recruited solely through  the agency of  the linistry  of Labour.    The loard does  not  propose to organise  amateur labour this year, although it  is  fully recognised that  invaluable help was given during the &quot;ar by  women who  gave up       s  their  holiday  and.  helped to  secure the harvests.

The whole  question is,  however,  beingtaken up with  the Admiralty.          The Ministry of Labour have, at the request of thisDepartment issued confidential instructions to their DivisionalOfficers and Local Advisory Committees to the effect that  anydifficult cases arising  out of the demobilisation of men connected withthe  fishing  industry whose services employers desire to secure  underthe  &quot;contract&quot; or &quot;slip1&apos;1 system, should be  referred to the  Board&apos;sDistrict Inspectors.

All the sheep and cattle purchased during the  last  two months have improved considerably in value and no losses have occurred.Already about one-half of the cattle are out to grass under better ,conditions than last year, and they are having  plenty of mangolds  fedto them.          It is hoped to fatten out tr%m 50 to  60 drape  cows  by theend of  July and a similar number of bullocks.   As fast  as the heiferscalve another calf is purchased and put on te them and by the middle  ofMay we  should have at least &quot;30 heifers grazing, each rearing  twocalves.

As thearea affected  is nearly  sixteen square miles comprising a great deal ofuf,oan property,  a  further apportionment  of  the rent charge would involvea  wast amount  of survey  and clerical work.
