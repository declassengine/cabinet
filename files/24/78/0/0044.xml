 .....ADMIRALTY   PROPOSALS   AS   TO   PAtfAND   ALLOV/ANOSS   OP   THE   ROYAL   NAVY   kROYAL   MARINES   (MEN  ONLY)(BASED  ON  THE  RECOMMENDATIONS  OP     THE  JERRAM  COMMITTEE).APRIL, 1919
          ADMIRALTY  PROPOSALS  AS  TO  PAY  AND  ALLOWANCES          OF  TrIE  RQyAL  NAVY  AMD  ROYAL  LIARIImES .jjm ONLY)          BASED ON TIG RBO OMt/iENDAT I reparations OF TIG JERRAM COMMITTEE.         Tho Board of Admiralty have now received and considered thereport of the Naval Pay Committee (Ratings) presided over &quot;by admiral sir Martyn Jerram,    The Committee examined a lareje number of witnessesat the Naval Ports, and also had before them reports of similarInquiries carried out in the Grand Fleet by direction of the commands-in-Chief, and there is no doubt that the matters dealt with have beenvery fully considered.     The Board have carefully reviewed theCommittee^ recommendations, and the proposals which are now putforward for the approval of H.M. Government, are in the opinion of theAdmiralty necessary to ensure the contentment and efficiency of theNaval Service.                 PART  I.    -   PAY  and  ALLOWANCES.                            I.  -   PAY.         The Jerram Comr.:committee states :-    &quot;$he mass of evidence which we received as to the inadequacy of&quot;the present rates of pay, added to what has been gleaned by the Grand&quot;Fleet Committees, convinces us of the paramount necessity of increasing&quot;the Service scales considerably.    &quot;It is in our opinion most important that the justice and real&quot;necessity of a considerable increase in the pay of the Service should&quot;be recognised without further delay.   The bonus awarded as from the&quot;1st February 1919 has done something to allay the discontent; the men&quot;dislike beinn; g^given small concessions, however, as has been the&quot;practice during the war, and nothing less than a rate of pay commen-&quot;commensurate with their value to the Nation will satisfy them&quot;.         The general request was that there should be a flat-rate rise of 2/s. for Boys, 3/s. for Ordinary Seaman, and 4/s. for Able seamen and above.   The scales suggested by witnesses before the Grand FleotCommittees were considerably higher.         The Jerram Committee was satisfied that these flat-rate riseswould not make for the efficiency of the Service, and has recommended the scales shewn in Appendix I, which have been &quot;framed with a view toBehboura$e men to qualify for higher ratinr and to reward thorn for the
                                                                 2. &quot;increased  responsibilities incurred11.    The Board of Admiralty concur in these  scales,  subject to the increases in non-substantive pay recommended in Section IV being made concurrently.    ROYAL MARINES.          The Royal Marines are essentially a part of the Sea rather than  the  Land Forces, and it is proposed to base their pay and pensions  in future on Navy instead of Army rates.   Also^ since the training  of the N.C01 s.and Men in the R.M..A. and R.M.L. I. is essent- ially the same and the duties practically interchangeable, there should be one general scale for both.   This will make it possible to merge all the miscellaneous small allowances which now go to make up tho pay of the  Marines, vizt: Efficiency, Good Shooting, Afloat,Instrument, Musical Proficiency and Qualified in Musketry Allowances, also shore Allowance for Serjeants R,M..          The annual cost involved in these Pay proposals, based on. the pre-war personnel of 140,000 (including the Coast Guard)                                is  ..................  2,839,000.          The additional cost for demobilisable personnel borne during the  next 12 months (including cost under other sections of                        Part I) is  ..................  200,000.                H. -  GENERAL ALLOWANCES and GOOD GOJDUCT MEDAL.          The recommendations of the Board are as follows  :-    (l) Good Conduct Badges, Pay for:          The allowance for each Badge to be 3d,in lieu of Id.  Badge Pay was introduced in 1849, when an allowance of Id. for a Badge represented something appreciable both in proportion to pay and in purchasing  power.   At the present day it is almost negligible, so that it is necessary to put an increased value on Badges.   The regulations as to Marine Badges to be brought into line with the Naval regulations, and  special provisions to be made as to Marines now serving.          The annual cost of those proposals is .......  440,000.
                                                                  3.    (2)  Long Service and Good Conduct Medal.         The possession of tho Medal to carry with it an allowanceat  the rate of  1 a year during the man&apos;s service after earning thomedal.   The scale of G..C. gratuities in Article 750, paragraph 9 ofthe King&apos;s Regulations (varying from  20 in the case of C.P.01 s. to 5  in the case of A.B&apos;s.) to bo replaced by an all-round sum of  20and to be paid at the time of the award of the Medal instead of at thetime of pensioning.         The annual oost of these proposals is..........   30,200.    (3)  Allowance in lieu of Spirit (&quot;Grog Money&quot;).         The pre sent allowance of Jd.a day to be replaced by aconsolidated&apos; allowance of 7/s. a month (equivalent to 3d a day).         For many years strong representations have been made on thesubject of this allowance.   As soon as a man reaches the age of 20,he has to decide whether to continue to take the present insignificantallowance or to draw his grog.    Prom the monetary T)oint of view itis not worth his while to leave it behind, and he therefore usuallydraws it and possibly develops a taste for it.         The annual cost of this proposal is  ............   150,000.    (4)  Working Suit allowance (&apos;W.S,.A!) and Engine Boom        Qlothing Allowance.   (&apos;E.D,.0.&apos;A.)         Both these allowances, and also Extra Pay for Coaling, tobe merged in the Kit Upkeep allowance whioh should accordingly beincreased by 10/-s a year for all ratings, and by an additional 12/-s.a year for Engine Room, Electrical and Ordnance Artificer ratings.Ratings not at present eligible for &quot;W.S.A.&quot; to receive its equivalent in the increased Upkoep Allowance in lieu of the extra pay they nowget when called upon to perform certain duties involving wear andtear of clothing.         This proposal does not involve any appreciable cost.
      HI.  - GENERAL ALLOWANCES  ETC,  IN FORCE  FOR PERIOD  OF  WAR.    (1)   ^Q ai^J4Qn^.Par exits,  and Dependants Allowances and         Allotments  Oonoesslon.          These  allowances  to  remain  in force  as  at present  until 31st  December 1919.          The Jorram Committee recommends  that should the  oost  of living by that  date have decreased by  25  per  cent as compared  with-prices on 1st January 1919, all the  allowances other than those for children should be  withdrawn  or proportionately  reduced by  the amount of  the decrease in  the  cost of  living,  and that  a permanent Children&apos;s Allowance  should  commence  as  from 1st  January 1920, at the  following rates :-                  7/s.  a week for one  child.                  12/s.  a week for two  children.                  16/s.  a week for throe children.                  4/s,  a week for each additional child.          The Admiralty recommend that  this proposal should  be  approved in  principle, but that  the detailed  scheme to take effect from 1st January  1919 shall  be further considered  and  submitted by the Admiralty before  the end of the year.  The annual oost of the Children&apos;s  Allowance is ...  1,500,000.  The annual cost of continuing the  Separation    etc.  Allowances  under present conditions of    payment would  be   ...&quot;..........................  4,000,000.    (2)   Kit Upkeep  Allowance.          To be  made permanent on the present  scale, subject to periodical revision when the  issuing prices of clothing  are revised.  The annual oost of this  allowance  is.............  675,000.    (3)   Leave Allowanoe.          To be  made permanent at the same rate as  the Allowance  in lieu of  Provisions  as is the  case at present,-the  object of each
                                                              137                                                               5.Allowance &quot;being  to  enable  the i&amp;n to provide his own food when not-being victualled by the Crown.    The  annual  cost  of  this Allowance is   ..............  250,000.    (4)   Subsistence Allowance.         The present rates for Petty Officers, Non-commissioned officers, Seamen and Marines, the maximum of which is 5/s. forabsence  for 24 hours or including a night, are entirely inadequate,and an  increase  of  the scale is urgently  necessary.  It isimportant that the  proposals already put  before the Treasury toincrease the allowance by  50$ shall be approved as part of thenew arrangements.    The Treasury have up to the present onlysanctioned a temporary rise from 5/s. to  6/s. a day.  (TreasuryLetter  of 15th  February 1919, No. 4788).    (5)   Hospital Stoppages.         Not to  be  re-introduced, except  in the case of men whoseailiaents may be  due entirely to their own misconduct.           IV. - ALLOWANCES FOR NON-SUBSTANTIVE RATINGS.                  and  OTHER. SPECIAL ALLOWANCES.    (l)   Non-sub stantlve Pay.         The increases recommended in substantive pay ifunaccompanied  by any increase in non-substantive pay, would greatly add to the  already existing difficulty of  getting men to volunteer for  non-substantive ratings, especially the more highly skilled seaman and  Marine  non-substantive ratings.   An  increase in the  non-substantive pay of these  latter  is therefore  essential.The Board recommend the  scales  shewn in Appendix II.    The  annual  cost  involved is......................  16,000.    (2)   Special  Allowance  for E.R.A&apos;s.          In the  proposed rates  of pay the principle  has  been followed of applying the  same rates  of  substantive pay as  are fixed  for the  E.R.A&apos;s. to  all other  Artificer  classes and  to Shipwrights.
                                                              1                                                              1 eiO         It is also proposed, on the recommendation of the JerramCommittee, to make certain small alterations or simplifications asregards certain allowances.         The details are given in Appendix III.&apos;    None of the changes involves any large expenditure.          V.  -  DATS FROM WHICH CHANGES AS TO PAY (INCLUDING                   BADGE PAY? SHALL TAKE EFFECT.         The Jerram Committee strongly recommends that the changes shall take effect from the 1st October, and it is evidentthat there is a very strong feeling in the Fleet that it wouldbe only reasonable to ante-date them to this extent in view ofthe late date at which the revision of Naval Pay has been takenin hand as compared with the increase of civilian wages.   This         This principle is likely to be strongly criticised bythe Trade Unions supporting the claims of the E.R.A&apos;s. ,  andalthough the Board consider it is the right principle when theE.R.A. is engaged solely on the manual work of his trade, it wouldbe fair that he should receive a special allowance when inaddition to his trade skill he obtains the additional qualification of being able to take charge of a watch in the Engine Room at sea.It is therefore proposed that E.R.A&apos;s. should receive special allowances on being granted watch-keeping certificates as follows:-     (i)  1/s. a day on obtaining the certificate of capability             .  of taking a watch in the engine room of a small               ship;     (ii) An additional l/s on obtaining the certificate of               capability of taking charge of the engines of               a small ship, but not to be paid until attain-               ment of the rating of Chief E.R.A. 2nd Class.   The annual cost of these allowances is  ..........   90,000.
                                                              139                                                             7.This argument is certain to ho strongly pressed in the House ofCommons.         The Admiralty do not feel able to recommend ante-datingto this extent (the oost of which would he  6,720,000), nor would it be administratively possible to carry it out if approved, owingto the numbers of men already demobilised.    It is considered,however, that the changes should be antedated to the 1st Februaryfor all risn still in the Service on the date from which theproposals generally take effect, it having been already announcedthat the Bonus granted from the 1st February was an interim awardpending the Report of the Jerram Oommittee.         If the 1st May be taken as the date from which the concessions generally will come into force, the oost of thisproposal for the permanent Navy is  ..............&apos;...... 540,000.         And the additional cost for demobilisablemen in the Service is..........................i...... 300,000.              VI,  -     GENERAL,      (a)  National Health Insurance..         It is proposed that an annual sum in satisfaction of themen&apos;s National Health Insurance Contributions shall in future bepaid by the Admiralty to the National Health Insurance Commissionand that the system of charging these contributions against themen&apos;s pay shall be discontinued.   This will effect a considerable reduction of clerical work both on board ship and at the Admiralty.    The oost of this proposal (not allowing for       the resulting economy in staff) is  .............  40,000.      (b)  Continuance of Free Railway Passes twice a - .             year to men proceeding on leave..         The Jerram Committee recommends tho continuance ofthis concession (the cost of which at present is  175,000 a year),which is greatly appreciated in the Fleet.   Pending full consideration of the future Leave arrangements of the Fleet,the Board are not able to express an opinion on this subject,
and propose to reserve it for further discussion.   (0)  Conveyance of families and furniture on final discharge        to pension or. on invaliding.         The evidence given before the Committee s&amp;ows that it isvery desirable that when men  ire finally discharged to pension or are invalided from the Service, the Crown should bear the expenseof their removal with their families and effects to their futureplace&apos;of employment.   Tho undoubted congestion In the Naval Portsis largely due to the fact that men cannot afford to move to other places on discharge.  The result is that housing accommodation is rendered more difficult to obtain for Active Service ratings andDockyard men, and that employers of labour exploit the pensioner by offering him lower wages.    The Admiralty recommend that this concession be granted.      The annual cost is..............................  35,000.   (d)  Recovery of overpayments.         There is no dount that much dissatisfaction and hardshipis caused by the recovery of overpayments made and received in good faith owing to genuine misunderstanding, or to ambiguity in the wording of orders etc.   The A&amp;niralty have already brought thismatter to the notice of the Treasury, and urge that the proposalsthey have made for discretion in regard to the waiver of such over-payments should be at once approved.   (e) Uerper of existing allowances.         Under the foregoing proposals, various Royal MarineAllowances would be merged in the new rates; also Victualling StoreAllowance (except an allowance of 6d. a day to ratings other than ..Victualling ratings when performing the duties of the latter): and ^-engaged pay to Seaman Class.         The annual saving in respect of these                       allowances is.................... 145,000.
   (a) Long Service Pensions.                   It is essential that  concurrently withthese improvements in pay and allowances,  a substantial improvement should be made in tho scale  of naval pensions.The important part played by tho Long Service Pension  in maintaining the Long Servico systom for  tho Navy, in spiteof much opposition, is obvious.  To continue to give increases of pay and allowances without any material improvement inpension would be a fatal mistake.         The Jerram Committee found that there is no questionupon which the feeling of the Lower Dock is more -unanimousthan this.   The men point to the more favourable rates ofPension given to the Metropolitan and County Police, whoro  apension equal to two-thirds of a man1s pay is obtainable after26 years1 sorvioo.         The Admiralty recommendations are as follows:-   (1)   The system on which Naval and Marine pensions are         based should bo tho same.   (2)   The Basic rate of pensions  should bo li a day. instead         of Jd.a day for each year of service: no maximum,  and         to apply to all sorvioo until pensioned.   (3)   Tho additions for Chief Petty Officer and Petty         Officer service should remain as at present,  but the         additions for Leading Seaman time should apply to  all         service as suoh (instead of merely to time in excess         of 3 years as at present).   Colour Sergeants and         equivalents to count time as Chiof Petty Officer;         Sergeant as Petty Officer; Corporals, and Gunners  -         Privates - Musicians - Buglers  (the last four-named         after 5 years1  service on tho recognised establishment         of a divisional or depot band)  as Leading Seaman;         other Marines as Able Seaman.    (4)  Possession of the Long Service  and Good Conduct Medal         on being pensioned should count as an additional M         (instead of Id. as at present).    (5)  Each badge worn on discharge to pension should count         as an additional Id. ,up to a maximum of 3d (instead         of 2d. for three badges in the  case of Naval  ratings,         and of 5d. for five in the case of Marines),PART TI - PENSIONS.
    (6)  That tho additions for a continuous record of v\Cs         for character throughout a man s service should count         as an additional Id.&quot; as at present.    (7)  Officer&apos;s Stewards &amp; Cooks to count timo for Pension         (&amp; Medal) from age of 18 instead of 20.         The effect of these changes will bo to increase the         average pension from  40 to about  78 a year,         and tho maximum from  64 to about  100.         Tho initial annual oost will be.......  873,000         increasing eventually at t,he ond of about 45 years to          2,246,000.   (b)   Pensions to disabled men.                   It will be necessary at the samo time to revise tho basis on which pensions are awarded to disabled men.At present such a man gets, no advantage on account of lengthof service unless he has served 14 years (man1s timo).   TheAdmiralty are looking into this question and will report furtheras to what is necessary,         The annual cost of such a change would probably be about 73,000 at the start,rising to somewhere about  160,,0000    (0)  Ago Pensions and Increased Age Pensions,                   At present Long Service Pensioners at theage of 55 become eligible for an Age Pension of 5d0 a day from Greenwich Hospital Funds,which may be increased to 9d aday from the same source at the age of 65.         It is woll known that it has boon a grievance for csanyyears that tho funds available for those Pensions do.not makeit possible to grant thorn to all men on reaching the qualifyingagos,,         It is recommended that in future Naval Funds should provide whatever sum is necessary as a supplement to the CeH9Funds available  so as to make it possible to give the Age pension and Increased Age Pension to every man on reaching the qualifyingages.
         The initial annual oost of these Pensions would ho 177,000 and tho eventual annual oost  505,000,  as  against 98,000 at present available from a.H.Funds    (d)  Pensions for wounds.                   The men were quite unanimous  in asking thatthose who are partially disabled but still  retained in thoService should receive injury pensions in tho same way asOfficers now get them.  This is considered reasonable andshould be granted.    (o)  Commutation of PensionsB                   This is a subject on which there is somefeeling on the Lower Deck.         Tho Admiralty are broadly against the policy of allowingcommutation of pensions, but consider that individual casesmay arise which would  justify permission to commute a partof the pension.         It is therefore recommended that the Board should be given  discretionary powers to allow commutation in special cases, subject to the condition that under no circumstancesshall the amount of pension unooianutod be less than 2/s,  a day.    (f.)  Wages of Pensioners,                   There is a strong feeling that pensions should not be taken into account by employers in fixing wages,and that the Government which has hitherto taken the oppositeview in some cases, should set an example in this matter.The Admiralty recommend that this principle should bo adoptedby the Government as their policy,         Question of application of now scales of pension..         The Admiralty propose that the new scales should applyto all fuburo pensioners, all pensioners now serving andall who have served during the War  including those serving in a                                                     civilian
civilian capacity.   For the sake  of administrative convenience,the new pension scales should be  ay plied fromthe 1st April as being the beginning of a quarter.         In addition, tho Jerram Oomtlttee strongly recommends that those  scales should be applied to all pensioners already on the rolls in consideration of the inoroasod cost of living and the higher standard of comfort normally aimed at,         The Admiralty recommend that the case of these men,in view of  thoir past  services,should receive the most favourable  attention of whioh the circumstances admit, butrecognising that the question is nno affecting all Governmentpensioners, they do not feel able to urge it as a claim onbehalf of the Navy  alone0         (Tho proposals as  to the Age pensions, if approved,will benefit some of these men.)         The immediate annual cost wouldJE.  601,000o  if the Basis of  award  of Disability   pensions be  altered as  proposed......... 701,000,which would disappear  as  the Pensioners  now  on the Roll die out.         Pensions for  Widows and Allowances  for         Children of Seamen and  Marines.         On this question the Jerram Comraitteo reported asfollows          11 Tho  request  for the award  of  pensions to widows  of &quot;active  service  ratings  and pensioners  is unanimousr.  The following contentions are urged in support of the  claim:-       4(a)   ,  Pensions are already granted to  tho widows  of             Officers  at  Admiralty discretion,provided  their             &quot;means  fall  below a  certain confidential  scale.       &quot;(b)   ,  Pensions to widows would be an incentive  to  matri-             mony  amongst Naval  ratings,who  should produoo              healthy children,  an asset to  tho State.   They             would  also tend to  remove  the  reluctance  of  women             to marry sailors on account of  the  long periods              of separation, oto.       11 (c)     Widows of men in  tho Police Forces  receive  pension
2M       &quot;(d)     Widows of rnon in the Fire Brigade receive pensions               &quot;only if their husbands are killed in the execution               &quot;of their dutyc       11 (e)     Widows of Civil Servants, receive no pension^but               &quot;the gratuity of one years pay or more awarded on               &quot;an official s retirement may be regarded as some               &quot;provision for his widow,          &quot;Committee1 s roco:rmiendations,c i After a full consideration of the foregoing, the^Coimiittbd is of opinion that the claim&quot;for the introduction of pensions to widows is fully justified and thoir institution is recommended on the following scale &quot;subject to the reservations stated:- 11i                 &quot;Scale(i)    If tho husband war, a pensioner,  the widow to     &quot;receive two-thirds of his pension,(ii)   If the husband was serving,  the  widow to receive     &quot;two-thirds of his accrued pension at the time of     &quot;death, including all increments  for petty time,     &quot;badges, etc.  (Minimum 10/s a week if death of     &quot;husband occurs in his first  period,and of 15/s.     &quot;if in his second period).             Reservations.(i)   &apos; To qualify his v/idow for a pension,  a pensioner     &quot;rating must have married prior to his discharge     &quot;from the Service.(ii)  To qualify a widow for a pension,she must have      married her husband at least one year before the      date of his death,  but tibis qualification may be      waived if a man is killed or drowned as the result     &quot;of an act of duty,  or if it be clearly proved      that the marriage did not tako place with any     &quot;fraudulent intention of obtaining the pension for     (the widow, and that the man was in good health when      he married,and tho disease which occasioned his      death was not brought about by misconduot.(iii) Pensions only to be granted to widows of ratings      who aro at least 25 years of age - and have served     &quot;4 years or more - at the time of death.(iv)  Pension to cease on ro-marriage of a widow,(v)   &quot;tension to be forfeited if at any time the conduct     &quot;of a widow renders hor, in the opinion of tho      Admiralty, unworthy of its continuance,
14.i mm &quot;i mm &quot;Compassionate allowances to Children:-    The question of provision for children on the death of a widow or widower was made the subject of universal representations,.  It was thought that there should bo a oompassionate allowance proportionate to the number, but not exceeding the total pension of the mother.   We advocate this allowance to prevent cases of hardship and recommend tho following scale:-         &quot;if thoro are two children - 2/3rds widow s pension.         &quot;         -do-three   &quot;    - 3/4ths    11       11         &quot;         -do-four    &quot;    -4/5ths     &quot;       11                      &quot;and so on, ,        &quot;Extension of this allowance to the age of 18 was asked for, principally on the ground of the probability of the ^school leaving age being altered.  We consider that it should be dependent on that factor,and that it should otherwise be paid to the age of 16.         In this oase also the Admiralty feel that though theproposals are most desirable in themselves and deserve themost sympathetic consideration, yot tho question is one thatcannot be looked at from the point of view of the Naval Serviceonly, or be placed in the same catogory as the above recommendations in regard to the pay, allowances and pensions of the Men themselves.         The annual cost is estimated at..,..,,,.,  71,000,rising         eventually to..........................*  706,000*         In putting forward those recommendations, the Admiraltywish to point out that in some respects they are less favourable to the Men and less costly than the proposals ofthe Jarram Oommittoe,   They have, however, been very oarefullyconsidered, and,, in the opinion of the Board, will satisfy thoreasonable claims and expectations of the Navy.  But they shouldbe regarded as the minimum which will have this effect.(Sd)  W.H.  LONG.       21st April,1919.
