I circulate to ray colleagues a Memorandum by theCoal Controller suggasting that tha time has arrivedwhan the  limited prices charged for British coal to allied countries should be withdrawn.  The Memorandumexplains the position.  I am informed that the FrenchState Railways, who act on behalf of the French Govern-ment in the distribution of coal, had made a profit onthe sale of coal up to the 30th January last of approxi-mately 35 million sterling,                                    A. o.

MBMOBAMDUM BY TBB COAL 00HTR0ELH8.FRICBS OP BRITISH GOAL SUPPLIED TO THIS ALLD5S,     Now that nearly six months have expired since theconclusion of the Armistice it is proposed that the limitedprices charged for British coal supplied to Prance, Italy,Belgium, Portugal and the U.S.A. as a War arrangement shouldhe withdrawn.                    Origin of Limited Prices.     The origin of the limited prices is a voluntary arrange-ment made by the coal owners in May 1916 at the instance ofthe Board of Trade.  The market price ;0f large coal was atthai time about 65/- f.o.b., and  the limited price agreed on was 30/- f.o.b. . This arrangement was made with france and  Italy only, but has since been extended to the otherCountries named above.                   Nature of Present Obligation.                   a* *M mm mm mm, - - - -* *- -* - ** -   ** mm, 5s mm mm - -     In December last the French Government asked thatarrangements should be made  to ensure that  (l)   Allied controls of certain essential commodities  -  including fuel should only be removed gradually and     with co-ordination of action of the several     Governments,  (2)   Such controls should be exercised so as to secure     that raw materials were available to the manufacturers     of the different Allied countries at the same price.     The British Government, in a telegram from Lord     Beading to M. Clements 1  Sated the 31st December 1918,     agreed in principle with certain reservations, one     of these reservations being that the application of     the principles to different commodities&quot;must     necessarily be considered in the li$it of the special     circumstances affecting the control and allocation     of the commodity in question.          In view of the existing arrangement as to coal     prices, no action was taken on thiri telegram in     regard to coal.           Financial Effect-of Withdrawal of Limited Prices.     At the present time the Allied prices are a few killingsper ton (about ?/6 per ton on an average) above the controlled
prices charged to home consumers, and about 40/- to 50/-per ton lower thai the open market prices obtained fromNeutrals.   It seems probable that if the restriction were withdrawn from Allied prices thoy would increase from 37/-and 27/- per ton f.o.b. for largo and small coal respectively to 60/- and 35/** per ton respectively,  or more,  an average increase of say 20/- per ton.   This would mean  an increasedcharge of about  15,000,000 per annum for France,  andsomething between  6,000,000 and  10,000,000 per annum for italy.   In the case of Belgium, Portugal and the U.S.A.the quantities are small ani the total  amount involved isabout  1,000,000 per annum,     The increased revenue to the Goal  Mines Account will therefore be about  25,000,000 per annum, an increase whichduring the rest of this year will approximately  suffice tomeet the estimated   deficit of  13,000,000 anticipated in.the interim Report of the Chairman of the Coal Industry commission as likely to result in the decrease in hours and increase iiwages of t5ie miners.                                          EVAJ D.J0&amp;BS                                        Coal Controller  2/5/19     Apart from the reasonableness on general grounds ofthe proposal to treat henceforth the present scheduleprices for the Allies as minimum instead of as fixed prices,there are additional reasons which iustify the adoption ofthis course without delay, namely, (a) Prance and Belgiumare both themselves exporting substantial quantities ofcoal to Heutrals at very high prices and cannot thereforee:-cpeot to continue to receive British coal to take its place on terms more favourable than those of the open market for export, and (b) the United States have withdrawnell limitations on coal prices and America is offering coal to the Allies, e.g. Italy, on open market conditions.                                      (Intd)  E.D.J.                                                    2/5/19
