15 POCUMKflT IS THI: PROPERTY OF HIS BEITaNNIC MAJESTY1 S OOVERNi&amp;NT.) CREf,       /  /        TAR CABINET.,7115.EMPLOYMENT IN PUfeLIC imgggS Off PERSONS OF             &quot;ALIEN ORIGIN.&quot;     Memorandum from the Treasury.  4        Since  the  be^inrj-ng  of  the  Far  many  questions have been asked in  Parliament, and there has  been  much discussion outside,  about the employment in Public Departments of  persons  of   alien originv&quot; 2.        The present position as regards the  admission  of such persons to the  Civil Servioe is&quot;.that    (1)   Under the consolidated Naturalisation Act  (British Nationality and Status  of Aliens Act 1914)^ Sec. 3, a naturalised British  Subject fitis  to all intents  and purposes  the status  of a natural  born British subject;    (2)   The General  Regulation&quot;  cf the Civil  Service Commission with regard  to Open C ^petitions admit, as candidates,  naturalised as -ell  as natural-born British subjects,  but subject to the  -important proviso  that:-         (a)   No person  &quot;-ho is not a  British subject and the              son of  a father  also a  British subject is eligible              to elite r the Admiralty,  Yar Office, or Colonial              Cff:&quot;.ce  except by special permission of the head              of the  Department concerned.         (b)   No person  rho  is not a  natural-born British              subject born rithin the  United Kingdom or one              of tlie  self-governing Dominions  of parents also              born within those territories is  eligible, for the              Foreign Office except by special permission of              the Secretary cf State.3.       The  question of amending the  general  rules hasbeen raised  by  the Civil Service Commissioners  --t  the Instance  of  the  Po3t Office,  rho, in  viev of  the Kind ofbusiness  &quot;hich  they  transact, including  the transmission rf all sorts  of messages by letter,  telegraph,  and telephone, feel that  some  further  restriction upon  the classes ofpersons employed in  their service is  desirable  if  they are to avoid  any possible question as to the  absolute loyalty of their staff.4.       There must  however be many  other Departments towhich the  same  considerations appl-vj  and it is  obviouslydesirable  to have a  uniform rule  for  all Departments.Exceptions to any general rules  cn the subject,.if appliedto any appreciable number of  Departments, rould make the assignment of candidates from open competitions a  difficult matter, and  freedom  of  transfer  of Civil Servants  from one department to another ^ould be impeded.  It seem, therefore,better to have no exceptions  to  such  rules as may  be prescribed,  save perhaps in the  case  of the Foreign Ofricevhich no doubt holds a  very special position.
5.          Any new rule should also be uniform in regard to    all persons of alien origin, whether allied,  neutral  or    enemy; for international relations  are too precarious to    justify a reliance on the continuance of the  present  grouping    of nations during the 40 years or so of the normal official    life of officers now or hereafter to be appointed.6.          The proposal of the Civil Service Commission  made    at the instance of the Pest Office  was that a candidate    should not be eligible for competitions who was not a natural    born British Subject and also the.son (or daughter) of    parents both cf whom were natur^%ritish Subjects.7.          The Treasury consulted the  heads of some of the    Great Departments unofficially as to whether  they would be    in favour of adopting a similar rule for their Departments.    tf&apos;hile a few expressed readiness to  adopt it,  the majority    felt that the proposed rule went somewhat too far, inasmuch    as i&amp; would exclude (for instance)  the sons of Officers    who had rendered distinguished services to the country but    happened to have married American wives.                                                   is8.          An intermediate course, for which there/much    to be said, would be to lay it down that a candidate  must    be a natural-born British Subject and the son (or    daughter) of a father also a natural-born British Subject.    From the unofficial communications  which have taken place    it would appear that this rule would be generally acceptable    to the Departments.  It is suggested that, if any exception    is to be allowed, It need only be made in the quite special    case of the Foreign Office, who mi.ph.tj If they so preferred,    retain their existing rule that a candidate for the Foreign    Office must be a natural-born British Subject and born    within the United Kingdom or in one of the self-governing    Dominions of parents also born within those territories    except when special permission is given to the Civil    Service Commissioners by the Secretary of State for Foreign    Affairs.9.          So far as open competitions are concerned the neyj    rule if approved could be laid down in the General Regulations    of the Civil Service Commissioners,10,         But it is desirable that, as such a rule (if  made)    would be of general application, it should be decided upon-by    Kis Majesty&apos;s- Government.  It would then be possible  for Heads    of Departments in pursuance of the  general decision,  to  apply    the rule administratively to cases  of appointments made not    by open competition but either by direct nomination or by    limited competition among nominated candidates.11.        If itVere desired to make the decision more    formally binding on all Departments, it could be done        (a)  as regards situations coming under the OrOer in    Council relating to the Civil Service by a clause in  a new    Or er in Council, but- (b) If it were desired to deal  with    the matter more comprehensively still it would probably have-    to be done cy legislation.   If, however, a Bill were intro-    duced to deal with the Civil Service (and perhaps with the    Army and liavy), it is probable that questions would be    raised.as regards Ministerial Offices and the Privy council which
    which it may be thought undesirable to deal  with  at  the    present time,  Even a new order  in Council might  prov&amp;ke    similar questions-    Moreover,  legislation or  an  Order in    Council would give  prominence to a measure which  might    be regarded as&quot;showing distrust of the countries  which are    now our allies,12.         It seems best to leave  the case of the Army  and    Kavy (to which no doubt special considerstions apply) to be    dealt with by the Army Council  and the Admiralty  as  they may    be advised,13.         On the whole, if anything is to be done,  it  seems    easie t to begin with the ordinary Civil Service,  proceeding    by Regulations made by the Civil Service Commissioners and by    administrative action as indicated in paragraphs  9 and 10    above.14.         The questions for decision are:-            (1)  Do Hi3 Majesty&apos;s Government approve  of  the    restriction suggested in paragraph 8 above?            (2)  If so, do they approve of the change being    introduced by Civil Service Commission Regulations and    administrative action by Departments?Treasury S.W.14th April,  1919.
