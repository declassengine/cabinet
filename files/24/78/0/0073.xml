jtS Wmfflm 13 THIS PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIA MATE STY * 5 QQVERNMENIF, j                      .,i red to       fctfatafcT-                 n        of Home ATiair ,  S E C R B T.   u                                                60ills 7173 *WAR CABINET.CO-ORDINATION OF METEOROLOGICAL SERVICES,Memorandum from the Treasury             It  is very desirable to settle at an early date the       future constitution of the Meteorological Office and the re-       lation3 between it and the several departments of State       interested in Meteorology.             The Home Affairs Committee have already approved &quot;the21,1918 proposal  to transfer the Meteorological Office to the       Committee of the Privy Council  (7(1)) subject to any re-       presentations the departments immediately concerned might       wish to make.&apos;!             The War Cabinet Research  Committee have at the request       of the Treasury oonsidered the  organisation and co-ordinaxion       of the Meteorological services  of the Country with special       relation  to the satisfaction of the requirements of the       Admiralty, War Office and Air Ministry.  The general recommenda-      J tions of  the Committee are contained in paragraph 18 of their       Report.   (R.C.12) &apos;,             The Committee expressly refrain from considering the       question  as to what Department  of State should be responsible       for the administration of a consolidated Meteorological service       (para.17) observing that they, understand that with the exception       of the Air Ministry all the Departments concerned have expressed       their concurrence in the proposed transfer to the department of       Scientific and Industrial Research.  The Meteorological Committee       have expressed their general concurrence in this proposal in       letter dated 27th March/ and in a further letter dated !?th       April101 making certain suggestions bearing on the relation be-       tween themselves and .the Committee&apos;of Council.  No insuperable       difficulty appears to arise out of any of these suggestions.             The question for decision is thus whether the Meteorologic-       al Office shall be transferred  to the Department of Industrial       and Scientific Research, making provision for the special needs       of the,various departments in the manner recommended by the War       Cabinet Research Committee, or  whether as it is understood the Air       Ministry  propose it shall &quot;be transferred to the control of the       latter Department.             The Treasury desire to support the former proposal, which       appears to afford the best means of providing for the requirements       of the public service and the future progress of the science.             If  it is adopted the question of the housing accommodation       of the Meteorological Office will call for early settlement.             It  should be an express direction that rival meteorological       organisations by the Air lUristry or other public department a are,       not to be set up except in confcxnity with the general principles       sketched  in the Research Comiiustess lie pore and what there should       be the fullest co-operation and exchange of data and ideas betweer       all departments.

RESEARCH COMITTbF^       Report of Sub-Committee on Meteorological Services.                           REFERENCE^      (1)    In their letter of 25th January, 1919  (R.C.  7a) the      Treasury requested, the Committee to  advise upon the organisation      and co-ordination of the Meteorological Services of the, country,      and 3!hey enclosed papers relative to, the question cf re-organising      the Meteorological Office in such a way as to enable It to      satisfy the special requirements of the Admiralty,  the Var Office      and the Air Ministry, while continuing to carry on  the meteor-      ological serviees which it has normally performed in the past.
INTRODUCTION(2)     We have examined these papers and other correspond-ence hearing on the subject.&apos;  ; e have also received evidence from the foilov/Ing witnesses :-                Sir Napier Shaw, F.R.S., Scientific Adviser to                              II. M. Government on Meteorology.                CoLBlandy, R.A.F.,  D.S,09, Deputy Director of                              Communications, Air Ministry.                Capt.Douglas, R.N.,  Assistant Hydrographer,                              The Admiralty.        v;e find that the calls for meteorological information and advice have steadily increased in all sections of theservice and that in the course of the war the demands which thefighting services have made on Meteorology, have been so greatlyenlarged as to render a re-organisation of the State Meteor-ological Service inevitable.        It is noteworthy that the new demands made heavydrafts both upon much of the research work carried out by the meteorological Office in recent years and upon the records ofthe office which embody the results  of discussion of accumu-lated observations and of statistical information.  indeed the experience of the war years has  shewn that, for known and possible demands alike, adequate provision for the systematic collection and study o&quot; current observations andthe maintenance of facilities and staff for meteorologicalinvestigation, are primary necessities in the organisationof a State Meteorological Service.        In 1917 the Meteorological Office submitted astatement which shewed that besides  carrying on the invest!-gationtof varied problems in Meteorological Science most ofwhich have an immediate practical bearing, the staff were called upon for expert information or advice under the follow-ing heads: -For public administration:  Information bearing upon                  Food supply                  \iater supply                  Roads                  Public Health                  Conditions of working in Factories, etc.                  Law Cases.Navigation and transport:                  By sea: weather conditions of sea routex                  By landx                  By the air: weather conditions of air routesxExploration:  Supply of instruments  and information:                                   training of staff. .Agriculture and commerce (local and imperial)                  Climatic conditions of various countries and                  their variations.  Yveather conditions.xxThese services included forecasts of weather   and the supply cf infcimotion to local estah-   lishmeiibs as a general basis for local forecasts
       Engineering:   Information bearing uponthe working of engines                      at various levels in different parte--of the                      world.       rlaval and Military Services:  Information as to climatic                      conditions of various theatres of naval,                      military and aerial warfare.

Supply of instruments.       3.      There  has not recently been any material alteration in       the nature of  the services required from the Meteorological Offic       b- the Civil Departments of the Government, the Mercantile Marine,       or the Industries, and the machinery for supplying such services       has already been established within the existing organisation of       the Meteorological Office.  So far as these needs are concerned       the central meteorological service will have to be developed       in certain directions which have been indicated by the Meteorol-       ogical Committee in their statement of 28th December,1917; this       development would not however., call for re-organisation although       it would necessitate a considerable increase of staff.       4.      The dominant new-considerations in the national       requirements in respect&apos; of meteorology are those which concern       the needs of the Wavy, the Army, the Air Force and Commercial       Aviation,               In 1915 the T&apos;/ar Office, with the aid of the I/eteorolo-       psychological  Office,  formed a meteorological service for the Army.  The       Officer personnel of this Service was made up of men from the       staff of the Meteorological Office and.others trained in the       Office.  The Royal Naval Air Service was developed under the       Admiralty at the beginning of the war;  in 1918 the greater       part of it was transferred to the Air Ministry who have since       largely expanded it.  The Meteorological Office has co-operated       with all these services as fully as was possible with the       limited staff  at its disposal but, taken a3 a whole, the       arrangements which were made under stress of war did not       provide a satisfactory measure of co-ordination.               In the case of the Army we find that the provision       necessary to meet their requirements has recently been the       subject&apos;of discussion with the Meteorological Office and that       a scheme of consolidation of sen/ice and pe-sonnel has ^een       drawn up which is entirely in accord with our conclusions.               Vie have received evidence from the Admiralty and the       Air Ministry as to their continuing requirements.       5,      In Sections 6 - 11 below we state the general conclusions       at which we have arrived and we indicate the more important       considerations which must in our opinion affect the lines of       reorganisation to be adopted.                                                                  9 P &apos;7
        In Sections  11 - 17  we  deal  with the  methods  by -hi oh the  Peraon&amp;el of the  several fighting services may be  related to tho  central meteorological  service on a re-organicatIon of the  meteorological services  generally.        In Section IS  we state  our recommendations  on tho whole  question referred to  us. Considerations which  aff eotthe/ qr$ani sat ion and co^orddnatl^           of  the Hetoorological Services of  the country. 6..      On the necessity of  a very large measure of consolida^ tion of meteorological  services we  wish to emphasize the following points:-   (a)  The meteorological material  required  by the Meteorolo$a ical Office  (for general service) by  the Admiralty,  by the &apos; *ar  Office and by the Air Ministry  is-to a largo extent eommjii to all  of these as  a  basis  for  their  current work.   All thift material  ought to be  available  in a ready  and systematic way for  Research  and the  advanee of meteorological science in the interests of  all these  services,  s   (b)  Uniformity of  practice in meteorological observation both here and in other  countries is of first importance,   (c)  For weather  work speed of transmission is essential and  a scheme  of transmission common to all the Services should, be arranged if  that speed is to be  secured with economy,   (d)  The number of  skilled meteorologists  is not large and a good  organisation of  meteorological  services is  necessary for  the full  use  of the  trained staff  available or likely to be available.        These  four fao&amp;ors demand the  closest co-operation possible  between  the  several existing  services.   re are of opinion that  this co-operation  can best  be provided  for by establishing  a  central  organisation for  all  common parts of the  current work  and by  placing In that  organisation Departsmental  Sections maintained for  the  special - standing  or occasional -  needs  of individual servio.es viz.  the Wavy,  theArmy, the Air Force, the Mercantile Marine and CommercialAviation.   These Departmental  Sections  should have  access to the work  of the Central  Service and the  Central Service shouldbe kept Informed  of the work and projects of the Departmental &apos;Services *.7.     Tho organisation  as a whole ought to be  such that each service would benefit by joint arrangements in respect of:-.       Systematic observations on land,  at sea,, and in the   air  (observations&quot;from all are required for  the benefit of   each Service).       Tho speedy and regular collection of these  for current   examination.       The preparation of general or particular forecasts  from   them,.   (The best use of the material, a wide range of   observation and  special skill in interpreting them are   required.)
       The distribution of weather reports and forecasts   either generally or to particular centres.   (Speed of   collection and transmission is greatly increased by   central organisation).       Access to printed and manuscript records in the   Keteorological Office,       On the other hand&apos;one Service or another would require.either regularly or from time to time, special additional information or Interpretation which could be readily preparedby the Departmental Offices working in close relation withthose of tho general organisation.   So too the general forewcasts received at a particular station could there be supplemented by the local officer in consideration of localconditions aud in the light of later local observations.8,.     In the 1917 proposals for expansion of work under the meteorological Office., emphasis was laid on the developmentof local forecasting stations to serve special areas or special interests,, industrial as well as military.For the proposals made by the Leteorological Office aconsiderable increase of staff is- required, but this provision would be a measure of economy i$ it were arranged as part of p,Service common to tho several groups of requirements in thismatter..   Under the organisation contemplated,. SecondaryForecasting Stations able to make local forecasts in supplement to the general forecasts issued by the Central Office, wouldmaintained at centres of permanent or temporary importance 1$respect of marine,&apos; aerial, military or others requirements.These local forecasts would be based on the information supplied from the Central Office as to general conditions and prospects,together with further information supplied specially to theLocal Station, from the Central Office or elsewhere,, and theywould be framed with a knowledge of local conditions at thetime of forecasting and also of the general climatic conditionlof&apos; the locality,.       In the establishment of local stations for observation^ &apos;and for forecasting,&apos;the Authorities concerned with the dovelopwment of Civil Aerial Transport will require to have power and facilities-for prompt action,   They should however keep theCentral Service fully informed of the action they contemplate,&apos;for that service has increasing interests in world meteorolo^i9.     iiuch research is required no less for the increase o knowledge of Meteorology than for improvement, in its practiseapplication..   There is little that is sectional in this,   fQfinstance, meteorological science as. a whole Is now specially concerned with full and accurate information as to tho conditlQ&amp;S.prevailing in;the.upper atmosphere, and this calls for a con-sidcrable extension of the work which has been done by the meteorological Office, in the course of tho last 12 or 15 year$at its own Observatories and with interimtl^3ftsl^*operationjto-day, the Air Services -give increased facilities for theseinvestigations, and the requirements of Aviation make themspecially urgent.   Again weather research cannot be carriedon apart from daily study of weather In a Forecast Office. TJaf$*fcsB3&amp; research work would gain greatly,by the maintenance of close touch between the various sections of the staff and bythe readiness with which all aspects.of particular phenomena
could be brought under review.   Indeed the sections ofthe Lteteorological Office which are charged with scientificinvestigation, and with the collection and discussion of statistical and other information, serve all sectionswhich have to deal with applications of Leteorology,   Itis therefore very desirable that tho organisation of the ser-vice as a whole should be such as to facilitate temporaryinterchanges of officers between sections, so that all mighthave at least a general knowledge of the methods employedwithin the Office.10,    The methods of providing for the requirements of theservices and the extension of their field now call for special attention to organisation in viow of -   (a) the nature of the information necessary for aviation        which has to be based on observations on land, at        sea and in the air;   (h) the importance of the systematic observations        obtained from ships;   (c) the demand for information as to conditions prevailing        in the upper air over a wide region;   (d) the advantage to be gained by linking up tho British        Meteorological Service more closely than at present,        with that of British Dominions;   (e) the need for rapid communication of reports;   (f) the maintenance of interchange of current observations        with foreign countries cn as simple a basis as possible   (g) the need for defining a single channel for inter-        national communications,and   (h) the advantage of placing the peace arrangements for        meteorological services on a basis which would        simplify the transition from peace to war conditions.11,    The number of trained Loteorologists on Yrtiomthepublic services can draw at present is very limited.   It istherefore necessary to make the best possible use of thepowers of these well qualified men and for this the organisa-tion of the meteorological service as a whole must be complete.For all service that requires men to be meteorologists only,it is desirable that -there be a sufficiently broad field tomake the profession of Meteorology attract young men of ,promise.   Further, it is Important that there should soon be adequate provision of University teaching in Meteorologyand of related Research Studentships so that the growing demand for Meteorologists would be mot.                     CORRELATION OF PERSONNEL,12,    In the matter of personnel the special requirementsof tho Havy, the Army, the Air Force and any publicservice established in relation to Civil Aerial transport should be met in either or both of two ways, viz:-
     (a) Members of the staff of professional Meteorologists         In the general Meteorological Service 3hould maintain         special touch with the needs of that separate service,         and should be marked out for duty in it if and when,         required.     (b) Officers whose career started and was expected         to continue in one of these Services, and who         appeared to be qualified for meteorological         work should be seconded for a period to the         general Meteorological Service; while attached         to that Service they would acquire familiarity         with the methods employed in those branches of the         work which ore of special importance to their own         particular Service..   Of the Officers who showed         aptitude in their period of such seconded service,         some should be selected for a  /later  period of         experience at the Meteorological Office.  Their duty         during this later period would be in a position of         greater responsibility than their earlier duty had         been.13.     Some such method of connecting serving Officers with current meteorological practice would enable each of these departments to obtain meteorological experience for a numberof its own men without withdrawing them from normal serviceexperience and promotion...,  It would keep the generalMeteorological Service in touch with the requirements of theServices.  It would provide these Services with a supply ofmen who had had training in &apos; eteorology and who would be themore valuable in many ways including staff work.14 .     The Army Council have asked the Meteorological Officeto arrange for maintaining a Meteorological Vstablishment tomeet the requirements of the Army under peace conditions and capable of ready expansion if and when required in war. Thisscheme is in practical accord with  that suggested in (a)oofparagraph 10 above15.     Cmptain Douglas, R.N.,  in giving us  evidence for theAdmiralty, outlined - scheme which  combines the suggestions made in  (a) and  (b) of para, 10 above.  This  scheme couldreadily be-worked out in detail by  the Central MeteorologicalService and the Navy.16.     CoLBlandy, D.S.O., R.A.P.  in giving us evidence forthe Air M-lnifetjpy&apos;. informed us as to the s Special meteorologicalrequirements of the Air Services, emphasising as requirementspeculiar to them  (a) particulars as  to upper  air conditions and  (b) local forecasting.  He  expressed the  view that a singlymeteorological  service, could meet  the  needs  of the &quot;wavy,  theArmy, the Air Force and  ublic  and-Commercial interests.He stated that  the Air Force required all that the othersrequired, with  information as  to the upper air in additionthat it was e ssentla! to security that  a trained meteorologistshould be attached to each aerodrome, and that meteorologicalinformation was  so vital to tho Air Cervices  that they would prefer  to control the whole.
9 ft 9(0 a 6 17,     On  the general question of the possibility of co- ordination, and  Indeed of a large measure of consolidation there  is thus practical agreement.   The further question as to what Department  of State should be responsible  Cor the administration of a Consolidated Meteorological Service is now before the  Home  Affairs Committee of the Cabinet In the form of a proposal that  the Meteorological Office be placed under the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, and we understand  that  with the exception of the Air Ministry, all the Departments  concerned have expressed their concurrence In the proposal,    On  this question we are not asked, to express an opinion,&quot;18,     T;;re  recommend that     (a)  The provision for the Meteorological Office be so          increased as to enable it to perform the functions of          a central state meteorological service.     (b)  The Admiralty, the War Office and the Mr Ministry          should be represented on the Board of Management of the          Meteorological Office with other State Departments for          whose  operation meteorological information is          required, and with members selected in respect of          special knowledge of Meteorological Science.     (c)  The Meteorological Office should be removed from          South  Kensington to some place &apos; ithin easy reach of          the Admiralty, the Var Office, and the Air Ministry,          and should be in direct&apos;communication with the G.P.O.          and a  wireless station.     (d)  The collection of current meteorological observations          should be a general service;   Provision should be made          for the collection of supplementary area observations          required for local or area forecasts..   The Air          Ministry  should have power to establish meteorological          stations required in connection with Aerial routes          although not otherwise necessary for the general          meteorological service.   The observations made at          such stations should be reported for record and          reference at the Central Meteorological Office as          ship observations now are.     (e)  The Meteorological Office building should be suitable          for the accommodation of a service on a much larger          scale  than at present and should include rooms for          Officers detailed by the several  ar Departments of          State  for meteorological duties there.     (f)  These  Officers should have ready access to the library          and records available at the Meteorological Office          for reference and should carry on their work in due          relation  to the general service of collection of          information for the office.
(g)   The special  arrangements  for  the meteorological  service     which the Central  Office  could render  to  each     Department,  War  or Civil,  should be  made  between the     authorities  of  the Meteorological  Office  and those of     the Department  concerned.

In reply to your letter of the 6th December in which youinform me that the Meteorological- committee would be glad to learn what form of administration Idle Department of scientific and industrial Research propose for the Meteorological office nowadministered by them,  I am directed to say that the broad out-lines of organisation would be a3 follows      in the first place it is proposed that a new AdvisoryCouncil should be established to deal with the Geophysio Sciences.
- 13 -This Council would consist of probably seven or ei^ht distingu-ished men of science who would be responsible for advice to theCommittee of Council on general questions of policy in regardto the Geophysic Sciences.   The Council, which would be asister body to the existing Advisory Council for Scientific andIndustrial Research, would have attached to it assessors fromall the Government Departments concerned in tho work which fal3swithin its purview,   Connected with tho Council, but directly responsible to the Committee of Council would be a Boardentrusted with the administration of the funds allocated on the vote for the Geological Survey and Museum and another Boardsimilarly responsible for the conduct of the meteorological office.   In course of t.ime further Boards may be establised for the control of organisations dealing with other GeophysicSciences.     The Meteorological Board would include amongst its memberstechnical officers nominated by the Government departments directly interested in meteorological work.   It would probablyconsist of about the same number cf persons as the presentMeteorological Committee.   The Director might or might not be chairman of the Board,   That would be a matter for further cor-aideration.   The Board would be expected to prepare a programmeof work and estimate  of cost each year for submission to theCommittee of Council.   This programme and estimate would go through the Geophysic Advisory Council and would be forwarded bythem to the Committee of Council with any remarks they might seefit to make upon it.   The Committee of Council would then beresponsible for making such provision for the work of the Boardon the Estimates as they might see fit.   The Board would make an Annual Report which would similarly be presented through theAdvisory Council to the Committee of Council and would bepublished.  It might no doubt continue to be presented to bothHouses of Parliament if that were thought desirable,  Aftertransference to the Committee of Council it is contemplated thatthe Meteorological Office would be established in the neighbors. -hood of Whitehall and that provision in the new Offices would bemade for officers of those Departments of State which are most closely concerned in meteorological work to be accommodated, sothat any departmental sections for Meteorology which it mightbe thought desirable to maintain as distinct from the centralservice should be linked up with that service in the closest possible manner.     It will be clear from what has been said that the intentionof tho Committee of Council is that the functions of the Boardof Meteorology should be to all intents and purposes identical with those now exercised by the Meteorological Committees butthe funds at the disposal of the Board instead of being, as atpresent, a Grant-in-Aid would be provided as a subhead on the vote of the Research Department though it would be possible toarrange, if such a course proved desirable, that a Grant-in-aid for special purposes might be placed at the disposal of theBoard.                         I am, Sir,                     Your obedient Servant,                        (Signed)  H. FRANK&quot; HEATH.The Director,    Meteorological Office,         South Kensington,            S.W.7.
- 14 -LETTER FROM SIR NAPIER SHAW TO THE SECRETARY.r^PART?Mf OF&quot;SCIENTIFIC AND IITO^proletariat RESEARCH.              Copy of 02109.12th February,  1919.Sir,        Your letter No. 6?iS/lB dated 20th January,  1919outlining the proposals bf the Department  for the future administration of the Meteorological Office has been laidbefore the Meteorological Committee and I  am directed to  reply as follows :-    1.  At the present time as a consequence of the  Experiencesof War the Meteorological Office is faced with largely in-creased requirements  on thft part of Government Departments andthe general public for which a considerable extension cfactivity is needed.   Negotiations are also on foot  for in-oorporating the British Rainfall Organisation with the Office,Under its present scheme of administration the Office has passed through the stress of war with remarkable success, andthe present arrangement under which the Office is controlled by a body directly responsible to the Treasury has proveditself both workable and useful,.   The Committee, therefore,view with some concern the more elaborate proposals  of theDepartment for the administration of tho Office.   They have noted the  omission of the Royal Society from the -bodi.esmentioned as represented&quot; on the proposed Meteorological Boardand trust that the omission does not mean that the exclusion of the Society from its share on the controlling Board is contemplated,    2.  They recognise that in the reconstruction called for by the expansion of the application of science in relationto Government it is desirable for the various scientificestablishments belonging to the State to be co-ordinated  inone general scheme of administration and they hope that it  maybe possible to arrange for this co-ordination without introduc-ing statutory or other limitations of the controllingauthorities that would hamper the work of the Office.  Theyhave, therefore, thought it best to outline.in this letter.the plans which they had in view for the work of the Office and its extension and the means with which they proposed to carry them out,    3.  The Activity of the Office is foreshadowed in amemorandum presented to the Ministry of Reconstruction inDecember 191?.   It sets out the following list of requirements which the Office had already been called upon tosatisfy.        For public administration:  Information bearing upon               Food Supply               Water Supply               Roads               Public health               Conditions of working in factories, etc.               Law Cases
- 15 -298    Navigation  and transport:        By sea:  weather  conditions  of sea routes^        By landx        By the  air:  weather  conditions  cf air routesx    Exploration:  Supply of  instruments -and  information:         training  of staff.    Agriculture and commerce  (local and imperial):        Climatic conditions  of  various  countries and their         variations.  Weather conditionsx    Engineering: Information  hearing upon the working  of         engines at various  levels  in different parts  of *thev^         world.    Naval and Military Services:        Information as to climatic  conditions of various          theatres of naval,  military and aerial warfare.        Information as to weather&apos; conditions of do,  do.        Information hearing  upon  gunnery,                                 gas warfare,   &amp;                                 sound ranging,                                 &quot;bombing.        Training of scientific and technical staff.        Supply  of instruments.                       l&apos;;    x     These Services included forecasts of weather  and  thesupply of information to local establishments as  a general basis for local forecasts.    4..  The Memorandum contemplated the extension  andconsolidation of the work of the  Office in  the  near futureby the incorporation of the  work  of the British RainfallOrganisation, provision for  the systematic  organisation ofobservation under the Local  Authorities in  the  United Kinglom.,..the Colonies and Protectorates and on the ships of the mercantile Marine, the establishment of local depots for thedistribution of meteorological information  in Scotland;Ireland and the great seaports.  The Committee had alreadyrepresented to the Treasury the necessity for a scottish and Irish Centre at a coot of about  1,000  a year each-.        The proposed development  of aviation and aerialtransport includes the establishment of aerodromes atinternals along the main air routes, and for these it is certain that trained meteorological assistance will berequired which must be represented by  a local establishmentof the kind indicated for Scotland and for Ireland.   this assistance by whatever moans the cost  is provided must beavailable for  private adventurers  a3 well as for government officials.   Of these new establishments some may or may notbe directly under the control of the Meteorological Officebut all  of them will be  dependent  upon the meteorological office for some part of  the  training of the Officers, the selection and  supply of  books of reference and other  detailsof organisation.     6.,   In order to provide  for tho work of the Office in^-919^20  estimates have  been  submitted  for an expenditure of 61V-L89  of which   48,^00 would fall upon Parliamentary votes 47,000  M.O.,   1,000 Royal Society,   ^00 Department of Science
and industrial Research) the remaining  12,689 was provided by&quot;Appropriations in aid&quot; of which  9,700 is estimated as payment for instruments supplied to tee Services or private observers 400 is provided by subventions from the Gasslot Trust and theRosse Trust of the Royal Society for certain observatories,the rest represents charges made by the Office for services rendered to departments or to the public, or incidentalexpenses incurred on their behalf and refunded.  The cost ofstationery, printing and. publications is borne.on the vote ofthe Stationery Office and not included in the sum mentioned.Some additional expenditure of capital will be required inorder to bring the accommodation and equipment of the cb-servatories to the standard required by the conditions of thepresent day,7,     The information which the Office uses is supplied bythe Office itself and 6 Observatories included in its administration.       Two other observatories to ?bicn the Office makessubventions some 40 observatories belonging to the, Admiralty,the Air Ministry or the Far Office.       25 telegraphic reporting stations receiving paymentsabout  30 a year,       75 telegraphic reporting stations of foreign governments       10 Feekly Weather Report stations receiving payments of 5 or  10 a year.       About 600 volunteer stations in the United Kingdomand the Colonies.       If the British Rainfall Organisation is incorporated1 ith the Office about 5,000 volunteer observers ---111 be added.Before the far there were about 250 volunteer observers at sea,, aand this service will be presumably restored and extended.8.     Making an estimate of thee ost of maintenance ofthese voluntary stations it would appear that about  45,000provided privately is used for public meteorological purposes in addition to sums voted by Parliament,.  All told, theservices&apos; for the public utility of which the Office is re-sponsible may cost about  100,000 a year.9.     Information as to s elf-governing dominions and foreigncountries is provided by a system of exchange of publicationswith official  and private meteorological establishments inall parts of the world.10.    The observatories of the Office at Richmond andEskdalemuir are Physical observatories not merely meteorologicalthe primary purpose of that at kskdalemuir is the investigation of terrestrial magnetism in which also the observatories atRichmond and Cahirciveen (Valencia) co-operate.  The committee therefore, does not regard the geophysical subjects as outsidethe scope of the work of the Office.11.    The staff employed directly by the Office for themaintenance of the work is  bout 160 of whom 29 have a pro--fessional training in meteorology or magnetism and seismology-It is proposed to put the provision for the staff on a satis-factory basis to enlarge it to 207 inclusive of those re-quired for the service of the ,T&apos;ar Office and to introduce anew scale of payment and pensions  hich will offer a career forman of ability.  The increase of charges represented therebyis about  11,000 per annum of which  about  8,000 is includedin the estimates submitted to the Treasury.
       12..     The provision for training members *f the staff is at       present represented by facilities for lectures., discussions       and other obportunitiesin association with educational bodies       or scientific societies for the advancement of meteorological       or geophysical science and education, in addition to the %       technical training incidental to the ordinary work of the       Office and its observatories.       13.     It will be seen that the present scheme of the Office       and its finance Is based upon           1.  A grant in aid ,by Government.           2.  Subventions from the Royal Society or other bodies               associated with formal advice on certai n parts of the               work, and access for informal advice upon any scientific               quest ion.           3.  Payment by private persons and in certain cases by               public departments for services rendered:           4.6  Sale  of instruments and publications j           5.  Payment to the Post Office and in certain cases re-               c*very of incidental expenses of postage and telegraphy;           6.  The acceptance of voluntary  services from observers by               sea and land whe receive recognition in the way of               publications, facilities for acquiring instruments, etc           7.  An organised exchange pf publications with official and               private institutions in all  countries;           8.  The facilities.of  a school of meteorological education               and research as the basis of,training in methods  and               practice.       14.     Fith  some exceptions the Office has been accustomed to       pay the Post  Office for postal, telegraphic and telephonic       services at the rates  chargeable to  the public  It has also       differed from the practice of the Civil Service in that the       rules  for superannuation and retiring allowances are within       the discretion of the  Committee subject to sanction by the       Treasury.       15.     The Committee  contemplate close co-ordination between       the work of the Office and the special meteorological Services       of the several departments and they  also  contemplate arrange-       ments  with the Colonial Office for co-operation by inspection       or otherwise  in the organisation of  the meteorological work       of the Crown  Colonies  and  protectorates.   Their first care is to       make  suitable provision for the pay  and  status of  the pro-       fessional and technical staff  so that the  service may not be       hampered by inadequate prospects pf  a successful career.       16.     The Committee  would be gldd  to  know  (1) whether the       rules  of the  Department would  permit It  to make provision for       the continuance   * the activities as set  out herein  (2)       whether the Department  is  prepared to support  the  very  con-       siccjrable extension of meteorological  activity outlined  in the       foregoing paragraphs,  which the Committee  hold tp  be called       for in the public interest to  promote the  Incorporation of the       British Rainfall  Organisation  with the  Office, the establish-       ment  in association with the Office  of  depots  in Scotland,       Ireland, the  great ports and,  if necessary, at some of  the       aerodromes on the great air routes and  the provision of  the       staff  necessary for  the meteorological  Service of -Xhe Tar Officeoretary,artment of Scientific k                      I am,  Sir,  Industrial Research,     15,  Great George Street,           Your obedient  Servant,              g v 1,                                            (Sd)   NAPIER SHA?&quot;.

I am to say that it is not  possible,  in the presentcircumstances,  to reply In detail to the points raised&quot; in your letter, since tho Government have not yet determined to make achange in the present constitution of the &apos;.eteorological  Office,nor indeed, have they decided,  should any change be made, whetherthe work of the meteorological Office should be transferred tothe Committee of Council or to some other jepartment.        I am to say,  however, that should the Lie.teorologicalGffico be transferred to the Committee of Council they trustFellows of the Royla Society will continue to take en active part iii tho ^mssa^imnrtt  of the Office and, that there is nothing inherent in tho constitution of  the Department of scientific and industrial research which would dobar it from making provision for activitiessuch as those outlined  in your letter.  Mor do they see any reason to believe that  the proposals which were outlined  in their letter for the future administration of the Meteorological office would affoct unfavourably the prospects of the programme  ofactivitios which the Meteorological Office have in view.   indeed in respect of several items of the programme the administrative arrangements whioh were indicated would appear  to be more appro-priate than those at present in force,

In  reply to an inquiry as to the form of  adminis-    tration  whifih  the  Department  of scientific and Industrial he search    propose  for  the  loteorological Office the Committee havo    received a letter r  6718/18 from which it appears  that in place -   of  the present Meteorological Committee  with tho Director as    Chairman responsible only to  the Treasury for tho  control of    the funds placed at  its disposal (with the Gassiot Committee    of  the Roy&amp;X society acting as an advisory Committee for  the    work  of  certain  physical  observatories)  the  Department proposes    to  substitute         (1) A Ivieteorological Board (of which the Director             might or might not bo Chairman) entrusted with  the             administration of the funds allocated for the jMetoo.rologic             Office  and  presenting its annual programme and  annual             roport  to         (8) an  advisory Council  for Geophysic sciences consisting             of  seven or eight distinguished men of science  who             after consideration  would pass on the programme  or report             to         (3) the Committee of Council, a ministerial body             reeponsible to Parliament for the vote for scientific             and industrial Research.

 of opinion  that  the  present  constitution as set  out  in Treasury Minute  of 20  May.  1905  should  be retained,  They think it advisable that the Director  should continue to be the Chairman of the  Administrative Committee and the poviera of delegation in- eluded  in the ..minute should  be maintained, as in no  other way can the necessary  association  of initiative with responsibility be  securod.   The permanont division of responsibility between the Chairman, for  the work of  the Committee, and the Director, for the work  of the  Office,  should hot be contemplated.     The other members  of the  Committee have been appointed by  the  Treasury, 1 the  Hydrographer of the flavy  representing the                          A&amp;mir.(\lty, and                   nominated by the Royal Society                 1   n         &quot; the Board of Trade                 1   &quot;         &quot; the Board of agriculture                                      and fisheries                 1   n         &quot; the Treasury, and to  these  has recently been added a representative of the Air Ministry.  The War Office has been represented temporarily by one of the representatives of tho EoyU society-.     Under the new Constitution the representative of the Treasury would naturally bo replaced by a representative of the Committee of Council.    In view of the importance of close association with the meteorological work of Oolonaal Governments it would be desirable that there should, be a representative of the Colonial Office,  and further in view of the prospective incorporation of tho work of the British Rainfall Organization it would become desirable to have a representative of the Department concerned with water-supply,  either the Local Government Board or theMinistry of Health.  Ho other alterations seem to the Committee to be called  for.                     The advisory Council.     It seems important to the Committee t tat the new Board should be directly responsible to the Committee of Council and not transmit Its  official comrnunications through any other body as appears, from  the letter 6713/18 already referred to.  At the same time there is an obvious opportunity of usefulness in the proposedAdvisory Council of geophysic sciences as advisory to the Ob-n-mittee of Council.   There may appear to be only a formal dixfernnc between the  Meteorological Board being in direct communicationwith the Committee of Council and its communications being re- ferred by the Committee of Council to an advisory Council for oomment on the one hand, and the Meteorological Board presenting its communications in the first instance to the Advisory Council to be forwarded to the Committee of Council on the other hand.But in course of time the difference might become a very real one and as it is essential to preserve the responsibility of the Director and Board for all matters of policy and administration there ought  to be no doubt about their right of direct commn.nica- tion with the Committee of Council.                         &apos;     There exists already an advisory body for geophysics i\ ^ tho shape of  the Gassiot Committee of the Royal Society appointed in accordance with an agreement between tho Treasury and t^s-H^alSociety (1)  to act as Trustees of the Gassiot Puna, and (2) to   - P  ime the Meteorological sommittee as to the work of the   \;-:.^J.cal observatories at hichmond (lew Observatory)           \                                         Eskdalemuir /           .&apos;;
Eskclalomuir and .Cahtroiveon (Valencia Observatory)..  The Gaeeiotfund represents the income of a sum. of  10,000 given to theRoyal Society in 1871 in trust for tha maintenance of physicalobservations at Kaw Observatory or at a substitute for it.         The Committee one no reason for terminating this arrangeraent and they submit that the agreement with the Royal Societyshould be continued and DISCO in this country the number of dis-tingui sheet mon. of science conversant with geophysical, work inaddition to the persons already officially connected with theadministration is small, they beg leave to suggest that theproposal might take the form that there should bo an advisorycouncil for geophysics consisting of eight members nominatedone half by the Royal Society 4&apos; .o would be the trustees of tho(Jaasiot ?un&amp;,. and one half by the Department of Scientific  andIndustrial Research, and that this proposal should be offered to the Royal Society&apos;for their consideration.       The Removal of tho Work of tho Office to a more        &quot;      &apos;      Central Position.         In the reply of the Department to tho inquiry of the meteorological Committee it is stated that &quot;after transferenesto tha Committee of Council it is contemplated that the.Meteorological Office would be established in the neighbour-hood of Whitehall and that provision in the new offices wouldbo made for officers of those departments of State which are most closely concerned in meteorological work to be accommo-dated so that any departmental section for meteorology whichit might be thought desirable to maintain as distinct from thecentral service should be linked up with that service in the closest possible manner.&quot;         The ^-nraittea cordially concur in tho proposal toaooominodavi  .10 various Meteorological Services in a singlebuilding as part of a schome of co-ordination..         Apart from any consideration of the necessity of a central positionY they csnnot press the acceptance of theirpresent quarters at South Kensington because there is notroom there.  They rent two floors,  the roof, part of  thebasement and of the top floor from  the Office of Works undera lease for 20 years from 1910,  and for the  accommodation ofthe increased staff during the war  they have found it neces-sary to borrow temporarily from  the Science Museum a  large part of the top floor and also to occupy a house  in CromwellRoad.   With the developments that  are in immediate, prospect&apos;the accommodation required will  bo  not less  than  double  thatwhich is included in the  lease.  So that  in  any case  room mustbe found for a large part of the work  elsewhere.   The committee therefore  regard the proposal to share a  building  in  a centralposition with  the departmental Meteorological Services as veryopportune.         The present  building was specially  designed  to  pro-vide  suitable  accommodation  for  the library  and.  facilities which did  not  exist in  Victoria. Street,  for  a Museum,  LectureRoom, experiments!  workshop  and  physical  laboratory,  with  theintention  of developing a scheme&quot;of. training- and  research  of-special character  as  a  School of Meteorology forming  part  ofa  complete  Meteorological Institute as  understood in  many                                             European/
European countries.  i?or those necessary parts of Meteorologicalorganisation no other provision at present exists in thisCountry.  It may therefore be desirable not to surrender the lease until suitable provision for the various activities ofthe Office have been arranged,                          I am, Sir,                      Your obedient Servant,                   (Signed)   NAPIER SHAW.
