MEMORANDUM  BY THE SECRETARY  OF STATE  FOR WAR.    I circulate for  consideration by my colleagues the subjoined memorandum by theGeneral Staff.                                               WINSTON  S.  CHURCHILL.  29th April, 1919.     1. The British  Mission appointed to visit the enemy chemical factories in the occupied zone which were engaged in the production of munitions of war has made itsreport, and it is desirable that the attention of the Peace Conference should  be drawn to the military implications of this report at the earliest possible moment.     It may not be generally realized that,  even  at the end  of the war, Germany stillpossesses a very  powerful  chemical industry, which  owes its  power chiefly to  goodorganization and combination.  This chemical industry is a very definite military asset,as the report of the British Mission  shows,  and  if it is left to flourish untouched, it will succeed again in crushing the  competition of other  countries by  under-selling,  andGermany will thus be left with a chemical industry,  which means large  potentialarsenals for the manufacture of  gas and explosives, whereas the other  countries, left with  small chemical industries,  will have correspondingly small  potential  arsenals.Moreover, the German processes for making ammonia and nitric acid from the  air are of very great military importance.   The Germans relied on them altogether for explosives,and also for fertilizers, which are indirectly of military importance.    In  this respectGermany has a great advantage  over countries  who depended on the import of  rawmaterials from abroad for similar purposes.     2. The following is a precis of the Committees report:      (a.)  Germans should be made to surrender various chemical processes, including in           particular the two processes for  making ammonia and nitric acid  from the           air.   This to be considered as part of the indemnity.     (6.) For some years Germany should only be allowed to sell at controlled prices.     (c.) An Allied  Commission  should be appointed to  watch the whole German           chemical industry.    (d.) The large stocks of explosives and  gases in Germany should  be destroyed.    (e.) Measures should  be taken to  destroy  chemical factories in  the  event  of a          renewal of hostilities.    (/) In addition, there are  four recommendations calculated to  foster  our  own          chemical trade.    3. The  following  are the military considerations which affect this report:     (a.) It is very important that the Germans  should  be made to  surrender various          chemical&apos;processes,  particularly those concerned  with  the  making, of          ammonia and nitric acid from the air.    (6.)  Since it is obviously important that this  country should have a large  and          independent chemical industry, the control  of Germany&apos;s  prices would          appear to  be essential.    (c.)  The appointment  of an  Allied Commission  to watch  the  German  chemical          industry is no doubt a desirable  measure from  an industrial and therefore          from a military  point of view.    (d.)  It is most desirable that the large stocks of explosives  and gases in Germany          should be destroyed, and that the  Germans  should only be allowed to hold          very small stocks of these for their future army.

    (e.) Measures should certainly be taken to destroy the  chemical factories in the           event of the renewal of hostilities.    (f.) All  measures  which will  promote the  development of  the British  chemical           industry are strongly to be supported from a military point of view, since           it is the best means of ensuring a large and rapid output of certain indis-           pensable munitions of war in the event of hostilities.    4. In conclusion, it is pointed out that it is essential that the report of the  BritishCommission on the German  Chemical Industries should at once be carefully  considered,and that measures should be taken to nullify the undoubtedly enormous superiority in producing munitions now possessed by that large and well-developed industry.  It isclear  that  all discussion  regarding the  limitation of national armaments  is  renderednugatory if Germany is left with this powerful weapon in which she is still superior to any of the Allies.  It  is also pointed out that,  until  the limitation of Germanyschemical industry  has  not  only been decided  but until  carried  into  practice, it is absolutely necessary for all the present military precautions and preparations in  regardto the use of gas to remain  in existence  in  this  and other countries, and that instruc-tion in gas warfare must continue to form a part of the  training of the  British Army.

2 rJ                                    INTRODUCTION.    The Mission was appointed to visit German  chemical factories in the zone occupied by theAllies which  had been  engaged in the production of munitions of war.  It was  instructed toobtain information  as to the methods of manufacture, capacity  and output  of plant, and presentstocks of explosives, poison gas and the initial products used in their production.  The Missionleft London  on  29th January and spent from  1st February until 14th February inclusive invisiting the important chemical and explosives works in the British zone, and the chief  chemical works in the French and Belgian zones, as  follows :                                        British Zone.    1.

The usual procedure was first to have a general view of  a factory in order to get an idea ofits lay-out and pre-war capacity, and of the way in which this had been utilized and extended forwar purposes. Afterwards the Mission divided into three  sections in order  to get details of thewar production as follows :          Initial  products  (e.q.,  sulphuric acid,  nitric acid,  ammonia, I ^5&quot; J^SJ6,           n  .1      r    ,\                                    i Lieut.

Poison gas................\Mr. Carr.    The information obtained by each section has been embodied in the present report.    In  some  cases   considerable   difficulty  was experienced in  obtaining accurate details ofmanufacture, especially as regards substances  which have a peace value, and  the information mustbe accepted with some reserve on  this account, although it was checked by cross-examination ofthe officials concerned, and by a careful  examination of the plant  admittedly  employed  for war purposes.    As a result  of  its visit, the Mission  has  obtained valuable information  as to the methods ofmanufacture  of  explosives  and poison gases employed by the enemy, and of the initial  productsnecessary for their production.  It  was also able to form a clear impression of the military value ofthe German chemical industry.    Some years  before the war a combination was formed by the Bayer, Badisehe  and  A.G.F.A.Companies, and somewhat later a second group was formed  which included Meister Lucius andBriining, Casella and Kalle.   During the war these two groups amalgamated,  and the GriesheimElektron, Weiler ter  Meer, Leonhardt and  other  smaller companies  entered the  combination,which is known as the LG.  It was largely owing to the efforts of this combination that germany was enabled to continue the war in spite of the blockade.   The LG. works produced the bulk ofthe synthetic ammonia and nitric acid needed for the production of fertilizers and explosives, allthe poison gas (with the exception of some chlorine and phosgene), and a large proportion of thehigh.explosives.    The following are the more important works of the LG.  which were  not  visited, as they are outside the occupied zone :          Factories of the Aktien Gesellschaft fur Anilinfabrikation ;         Factories of the Griesheim Elektron  Gesellschaft;         Factory of the Bayer Company at Elberfeld ;         Factory of the  Badische Company at Merseburg;         Factory of Casella and Co., Mainkur, near Frankfurt;         Factory of Leonhardt and Co,, Muhlheim, near Frankfurt.    A summary  of the information obtained as to the  war production  of the factories visited isgiven under the  headings of Initial Products, Explosives and  Poison Gases.

          INITIAL PRODUCTS  FOR MANUFACTURE OF EXPLOSIVES AND POISON GASES.    The principal materials concerned are ammonia, nitric acid and chlorine,  and it was on theoutput of these  that  the  war production of chemical  munitions depended.  The expansion of output by the factories of the LG. combination during the war is shown by the following tables: Oppau ..MerseburgAmmonia (metric tons NH3 per day).9 *     * *     ft *    ft *     * *Total* a     * *1914.  25  Nil  251918.  250  400  650Nitric Acid (metric, tons 100 per cent, acid per day).                                        1914.LeverkusenHochst  .OppauLudwigshafen..Weiler ter Meer 56150 ? 40? 121918. 180 375 100   40   24Total258719    Oppau has the power to produce now 500 tons HN03 daily, still retaining sufficient ammoniato supply the output at Hochst.Sulphuric Acid (metric tons 100 per cent, acid per day).                                          .  1914.LeverkusenHochstLudwigshafenWeiler ter MeerTotal340224275 48887 1918. 470 280 410   601,220    Meister Lucins and Briining have also  erected a large new plant at Hochst which has notyet started and was not examined.

No arrangements appear to have been made prior to too outbreak of war to utilize theresources of any of the dye  factories for war purposes, and  on mobilization  their chemists were called up for military service.  After the  battle of the Marne the Government realized the needfor expanding the output of explosives  and  most of the  chemical works were producing smallquantites by the end of 1914.  The demands made on them  increased during  191.5, but it wasnot until 1916 that  plant was  laid down to assist in the enormous  production of explosivesrequired by the Hindenburg programme.  Most of the  big extensions of. the  synthetic ammoniaand of the nitric and sulphuric acid plants  date  from this  time, many chemists being  released from the army and the scientific  staff of some  of the works  being augmented.  Standardizedplant used for the manufacture of dyes was converted for the production of explosives withremarkable speed; for instance,  at Leverkusen a T.N.T. plant producing 250 tons per month was put into operation in  six weeks.

At first, chlorine  and phosgene were the  main requirements, but afterwards a variety oforganic substances  Avere  employed, all  of  which  were made  by the  factories  of the I.G.combination.  Many of these substances were new and difficult to prepare, and rapid production was only possible  owing  to  the speed with  which the peace  organization of the dye factoriescould be utilized for this  purpose.   When the  Government wished to introduce a  new gas,  aconference of the various firms was held at Berlin to determine how the  manufacture  should besub-divided  in order to use existing plant to the  best advantage.  For instance, the initial stages of the  manufacture of mustard gas were carried out at Ludwigshafen  and the final stage atLeverkusen.

The above figures for the output of explosives and gas show the great military value of the factories of the LG. combination.  Although no arrangements had been made to  mobilize them at the outbreak of hostilities, they were rapidly converted to war purposes, thanks to their highly trained  personnel and the great technical resources of their peace organization.  In the future itis clear that every chemical  factory must  be  regarded as a potential  arsenal, and other nationscannot,  therefore, submit to  the  domination  of certain sections of  chemical industry, which germany exercised before the war.  For military security it is essential that each country shouldhave its chemical industry firmly established, and this must be secured as one of the conditions  ofpeace, as otherwise we are leaving  Germany in possession of a weapon which will be a permanentmenace  to the peace of the world.    The key to Germany&apos;s war production of explosives was the Haber process for the productionof ammonia from atmospheric, nitrogen.  It is significant that large scale production by this processonly began at the end of 1912, and that in the early part of 1914 great  pressure was put on theBadische Company to increase its output.  During the war, owing to the extensions of the Haberplants at Oppau and Merseburg, Germany has become independent  of foreign countries for her supplies of ammonia and nitric acid, substances indispensable for the  manufacture not  only  of high explosives but also of fertilisers for food  production.   Without  such  a process  germany could not have made the nitric acid required for her explosives programme, nor obtained fertilisers
234for food production after the supply of Chile saltpetre had been stopped by our blockade, and itis probable that she could not have continued the war after 191.(5.  In the event of another war we might be cut off from supplies of saltpetre, while Germany would be independent of them.    The resources of the German dye industry are of no less  military importance.  Most of thegases em jloyed towards the end of the war were complex organic substances, none of which hadbeen made previously except in small quantities, and some of which were prepared for the first time during the Avar.  Gas  warfare will undoubtedly continue to develop in this direction, and inthe future organic substances will be employed which we do not know to-day.  The use of gaswill always offer great opportunities for surprise in military operations, and the experience of thepresent war has shown that rapid production of a ne.w  gas is essential  if the surprise is  to be effective.   Any country without a well developed  organic chemical industry will  be severelyhandicapped in this respect.      PRESENT POSITION OF THE CHEMICAL INDUSTRY  IN  GREAT  BRITAIN AND GERMANY.    As  it is  clear that the military strength of a country depends to a large extent on thedevelopment of its chemical industries, it is necessary  to  review  the present condition  ol these industries in Great Britain and Germany and to consider what steps should be taken to preventGermany obtaining a predominant position.    At the outbreak of war this country was competing successfully with Germany in the heavychemical trade (acids, alkalis and bleach), but the organic chemical industry (dyes, pharmaceuticalproducts, &amp;c.) was almost entirely in German hands.  British organic chemical works were much smaller  than their German  competitors, and  all British  chemical works  were much  morespecialized, dealing separately with heavy chemicals, dye substances and pharmaceutical products.They were not linked up in  a combination  such  as that  now existing in Germany.  the big German firms referred to produced heavy chemicals, dyes and pharmaceutical products inthe same works.   This  method  of production  has  many  advantages, as  much transport isavoided and by-products can be utilized direct, owing to the large variety of chemicals made inone factory.  The range of production on a large scale also  enabled the  German works to crushcompetition in any one branch by selling below cost price without any material reduction of their annual profits.  It was stated by the Badische Company that the  financial arrangements betweenthe companies  in  the  combination  prevented  losses falling on  any individual  member of thecombine.   Thus,  for instance, if  a large profit were  made by the production of  syntheticammonia at Oppau and Merseberg, the combination could afford to sell dyes below cost price.    During the war  considerable  progress was made in this country  in producing  dyes andpharmaceutical products for  which we had previously  been  dependent on  Germany, but this expansion  was made at a time when the energies of most  firms were directed to  producingmunitions,  and when it was difficult to obtain  suitable  plant, and considerable assistance will benecessary in  order to  protect our  organic chemical industry&apos; before it is sufficiently strong to withstand German competition.    After the war even the heavy chemical industry may be seriously threatened by the Haberprocess for producing ammonia, which gives Germany a  cheap independent source of nitrogencompounds.  As the deposits of saltpetre  in Chile on  which the world  is at present mainlydependent are of  limited extent, and will before long be insufficient to meet the demands, theeconomic and military value of the Haber process, whicli  offers the cheapest  method for thefixation of atmospheric nitrogen is obvious.     In spite of the shortage of materials and labour  in  Germany, the  buildings erected duringthe Avar in all the works visited were of permanent character, and the contrast between the peacetime value of the extensions of chemical plant  made  in  Germany and Great Britain since July,1914, is very striking.  In this country all the nitrate  needed  during the war was obtained fromChile, and the bulk of the plant erected Avas for the production of  sulphuric acid or for explosives ;consequently  it  Avill be  of little  use  for  peace purposes, as the capacity  for sulphuric  acidproduction will be much greater than the consumption.  Germany, on the other hand, had to rely on synthetic  nitrate, and therefore a large part of her capital expenditure was on ammonia andnitric acid plant which will be a valuable asset in the future.  Her sulphuric acid plant was not increased  to the  same  extent as  ours, owing to the existence of large oleum  plants in dyefactories, and as it was possible for her to use existing plant for the manufacture of  explosives,she avoided to a large extent unproductive expenditure for this purpose.    Thus,  at the time of the Armistice, Germany is left with a  chemical industry which has agreater productive capacity than it had before the war.   But in  spite of this, there is no reason why she should regain her former position in the Avorld&apos;s chemical market, provided that measures are taken to assist the chemical industry in Allied countries during the period of re-construction.The general  impression  gained by the Mission  was that  the  technical  practice in the factoriesvisited was not markedly superior to that obtaining in England at the end of the Avar, and in some respects it was inferior.  The main source of the strength  of  the German chemical industryappeared to lie in its organization and in the  large scale of its production, Avhich had been made possible by the ample financial support it had received.    By means of these advantages, Germany had  been able to cheapen production and  establish a  strong economic position, and to secure the development of the industry by the large sumsdevoted to technical  research.  However, the rapid growth of British chemical  industry duringthe Avar proves that  it can compete successfully with Germany provided that  reconstruction isundertaken on a sufficiently large scale.
                                     RECOMMENDATIONS,    In view of the military  and economic  importance of the German  chemical  industry, theMission is of opinion  that this subject should  receive  special  consideration  both from  theArmistice  Commission and at the Peace Conference, and the following action is recommended :     (1.) It should  be  one of the conditions  of peace  that Germany should  put the Allies in &apos;           effective possession  of such  processes as  are  considered  necessary  for establishing           chemical industries on a firm  basis  in  other countries, one of these being the Haber           process.  Any private rights in respect of such processes (if any could be established)           can, if necessary, be  considered as part payment of the war indemnity.    (2.) For a limited period  of years  Germany should bo compelled to furnish, at reasonable           prices under Allied control, such  chemical products as are  required by the Allies, in           order to prevent her  from exploiting her chemical production so as to  exert economic           pressure in Allied countries.    (3.) All chemical works in the occupied  zone should  be controlled as  regards the supply of           raw materials, the purposes for which these are used, and  the ultimate destination  of           the products.    (4.) The provisions of  clauses (2) and (3) should be carried out by means of a Controller who           should  have at  his disposal  the  services of experts  in each branch  of the industry           concerned.   The control by the several  Allies should be closely  co-ordinated.    (5.) Enemy chemical factories of a character capable of being used for  the  manufacture  of           explosives and poison gas  must be considered in any scheme for the  delimitation  of           armaments, and arrangements should be made for their  periodical inspection by an           Allied Commission to determine the extent to which they are producing war material.               (Note. Such inspection would  not guarantee that the  plant installed was not           capable of being used for the production of toxic gases at short notice or  even was not           designed for that purpose.   After seeing the facilities afforded by the German chemical           plant in this respect, the Mission is of  opinion that whatever be the  decision with           regard to the use of gas in warfare, the temptation to use it is  such that it is essential           to  the  military security of this country  that adequate provision should be made to           continue research  in  chemical warfare,  and to  provide the troops with means of gas           defence.)     6.) Control should be established in chemical works not in the occupied zone to ensure that           they are not used for war purposes.    (7.) The large  stocks  of explosives  and poison gases  now existing  in  Germany should be           destroyed.    (8.) In view of the possibility of a renewal of hostilities,  measures  should  be taken so that           all explosive factories  and all  works of primary importance for the production  of           explosives, such as Oppau, could  be destroyed if they were  likely to fall into the           hands of the enemy.    Further, the members of the Mission are of opinion  that the attention  of the  Governmentshould be  drawn to the military  importance of developing and consolidating the chemical industry of Great Britain.  The points requiring immediate consideration are :     (1.) The speedy erection of factories on  an adequate  scale for the production of ammonia and           nitric acid from the nitrogen of the  air by means of the Haber process, in order to           render this country independent of imported nitrate.    (2.) The provision  of  factories on an adequate scale  for the production  of dye-stuffs and           pharmaceutical  products.    (3.) Action to  obtain the requisite security for the chemical industry during the period of its           development.    (4.) The  provision of facilities for  obtaining raw  materials such as  potash,  alcohol and           benzene under conditions favourable to  the industry.                                       (Signed)       H. HARTLEY, Brigadier-General, fA                                               (On behalf of the Members of the Mission).LONDON,    2&amp;th February, 1919.
