MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF  STATE  FOR WAR.    I circulate for the consideration of the Cabinet a Memorandum by the Chief of theImperial General Staff,                                               WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.  3rd May, 1919.    1. In view of recent events, both in the United Kingdom and in the more distantparts of the British Empire, I feel compelled to bring to the notice of the War Cabinetthe grave possibilities which confront us, and to draw attention to the serious shortageof troops with which we are threatened.    2. The number of troops to be retained for  Armies of Occupation was originallyfixed  at  900,000, at  a time when an  early peace appeared possible, and  when  noresumption of hostilities seemed probable.   It was anticipated that the re-enlistment ofdemobilized men  in  the  Peace Army, combined  with a gradual reduction in  our commitments, would not only enable us to replace wastage, but possibly even to releasefurther classes.    3. This hope has proved illusory.   Although  the total number retainable amountsapproximately to 900,000  (vido Table &quot; A,&quot; attached), it is deficient in many essentialclasses, more particularly  in specialists, such as transportation and  communicationpersonnel which are vital to the efficiency and mobility of the troops.    Recruiting for the   After-War Army,  which  proceeded satisfactorily up  to  apoint, has been hampered by the continuance of unemployment donations and, with theexception of  boys who are  useless for immediate purposes, is now producing only a fewhundreds a week.  Moreover, these  include hardly any of those specialists  which, as pointed out above, are most required.    4. On the other hand, apart from the numberless requests for British troops whichare constantly being  received  from every  quarter of Europe, our liabilities in vitalportions of the British Empire have increased rather than diminished.    Industrial unrest in Great  Britain, incipient rebellion in Ireland, insurrection inEgypt and revolt in India, added to the latent hostility  on the part  of the  Turksthroughout the Middle East, all result in urgent  demands for reinforcements which are too well-founded and too insistent to ignore.     In none  of these theatres can  the situation be considered  satisfactory, as thefollowing considerations show :                                   A. Ireland.     The  General Officer  Commanding-in-Chief reports in his letter of 7th April thatthe number  of infantry and cyclists at his disposal  capable  of  field  operations  is approximately 19,800 men; that the state of Ireland  goes from bad to worse, and thatthe Sinn Fein organization controls  some  100,000 well-organized, though indifferentlyarmed, men.   It is therefore necessary to contemplate no mere police measures, but activemilitary operations of a serious nature.  He asks urgently for 8 infantry and 2 machine-gun battalions, but it has been possible to send him only 5 infantry and 1 machine-gunbattalions, owing to demands from other theatres.     Telegraphing on the  10th  April, the Viceroy states that the situation is growing steaddy worse, and that it is impossible to deal effectually with it unless the 8 battalions are sent immediately.     (B1U/219)  70  5/19 H&amp;S 7107wo
     The despatch of even the 6 battalions referred to above was  ordered in spite of astrong protest by the General Officer  commanding-in-Ohief,  the Forces  in  GreatBritain, based on the possibility of grave industrial unrest which was anticipated  at thetime (vide his letters of 8th April and 25th March).   It is hoped that this danger mayhave subsided for the time being, but it must be remembered that such a situation mayrecur at any  time, very possibly  when the  crisis  is  most  acute  in Ireland  and elsewhere.                             B. Egypt&apos; and Palestine.     The original  Army of Occupation  allowed  for was 1 Indian  Division, 1  IndianCavalry Division and 1 British Infantry Brigade for Egypt.     This was subsequently increased on  General  Allenby&apos;s recommendation to 3  IndianInfantry Divisions, 2  Indian  Cavalry Divisions for Palestine and Syria, and I british infantry Brigade for Egypt.     These  arrangements were  considered  necessary to  meet  the  situation  which obtained before the revolt broke  out in Egypt.  This outbreak  made it necessary atonce to stop demobilization of all British troops ;  to remobilize the Dominion mountedtroops which were awaiting embarkation and to order the 26th Division (reduced nowto one weak  brigade)  from  the Dobrudja to Egypt.  Although this  outbreak  wassuppressed for the time being  by the emergency measures taken on the spot, general allenby has stated in his telegram of 13th Aprik  that  this quiet can only be consideredtemporary, and that an outbreak on a far more serious scale is in  preparation   In this it is anticipated that  the Egyptian  Army and Police may join forces against  us andattempt to release the  90,000  Turkish prisoners of war  now in Egypt.  General Allenbyaccordingly presses for additional reinforcements of:       (i.) One British  Division (over and above the residue of the 26th Division, which           numbers under 700 all ranks).     (ii.) Replacements for the Anzac Mounted Division.   &apos;  (iii.) One additional Indian Division to be retained.     The British Division  is being provided by sending four battalions from  Italy* and six battalions from France to reconstitute the  54th Division in Egypt.   An endeavouris being made  to provide four British cavalry regiments  to meet  (ii).   These measures are considerably less than General  Allenby&apos;s  demands, but are the best that  can atpresent be  done.   -  General Allenby has also reported that he  has 74,000 demobilized men whom hehas ,been using to quell disturbances, but that they are discontented and must be senthome  as reinforcements arrive.   This applies particularly  to technical  branches for whom substitution by Indians  is  not possible, and this total  does not include  14,200Australians and New Zealanders, who are also demobilizable.                                 C. Mesopotamia.     The forces have been reduced below the numbers  considered necessary as an army of Occupation since although the correct number of units  remain, cavalry  regimentshave been  reduced to squadrons, batteries from six  to  two guns, &amp;c.   In spite of the comparative quiet obtaining in  Mesopotamia,  the General  Officer  Commanding-in-chief has  stated that no more pivotal men  or  demobilizes can  be  released, as he is down tobed rock.                                    D. India.     The Viceroy&apos;s  telegram  of 18th  April  presents a  well-balanced appreciation of possible developments  in the  Dependency which, from its very restraint and  absence of anything  like  alarmist views, carries  conviction as regards what  preparations arenecessary.    The reinforcements  required in the event  of the  situation  taking an unfavourable turn are estimated at  four British divisions  and  four British  cavalrybrigades.     It is the duty of  the General Staff to point out that at the present moment  we are not  in a position to provide these units.   * Instructions have been received to-day (28th April) from Paris that the battalion at Fiume is not tomove on account of the delicate political situation created by President Wilson&apos;s manifesto.
     A glance at the  various  theatres  in which we have  British  troops will make this clear      (i.)  United Kingdom. It has already been shown that neither from Great Britainnor  Ireland  can we spare  any troops.  On  the contrary we have  not sufficient for ireland as it is.     (ii.) Army  of  the Rhine. Of  the ten  divisions and one  cavalry  division whichnominally  compose General Robertson&apos;s force, only  six divisions  are in  a  position tomove forward  in case of necessity and then for a limited  distance only and with  a reduced  establishment of  artillery,  engineers,  signallers and mechanical  transport.These six  divisions are the minimum required by Marshal  Foch for operations in theevent of the german  Government refusing to sign the Treaty of  Peace.  But, even  ifit were decided to draw on these units for India, it is estimated that owing to the large majority of the battalions composing this Army being young  soldiers&apos;  battalions, notmore than one division could be organized for service  in India, and to  do this wouldbreak up every division in the Army, which would be thereby reduced to impotence.     (hi.) Troops in France and Flanders. These are already being drawn upon to theextent of six battalions for Egypt and to maintain the necessary Lines of Communicationservices in Italy. It is considered that no further number can be drawn from this sourcewithout  dislocating the whole organization for the recovery of the vast amount of stores and equipment  now scattered throughout this area, at the mercy of the climate  and open to the depredations of the civilian inhabitants.   It must be pointed out, however,that the 120,000 troops now locked up on these duties are fulfilling no military functions,but are  being  so employed with  a  purely financial object, and it is for consideration whether the ultimate financial return will  be  commensurate  with the enormous cost ofmaintaining this large number of fighting troops,  in addition  to German  prisoners,Chinese  coolies,  &amp;c.  Should the contemplated military emergency arise in India it will,in any case, be imperative to draw on this source regardless of consequences.     (iv.) Turkey and  the Caucasus. General Milne&apos;s forces  have  already been reduced from four  to two Divisions, but of the British troops now under his command some40,000 are entitled  to  demobilization, whilst the great majority have had no leave for along period.  Even after evacuating the Caucasus, it  is considered that  General Milnewill have none  too  many troops to  enforce the  terms of  peace  on Turkey,  and  that(assuming that this task will fall to us) all he  has will be wanted in the  neighbourhoodof Constantinople for this purpose.     5. The above survey will suffice to show  that  there is  no  available source fromwhich the 4 Divisions  and  4 Cavalry Brigades can at present be provided if  the worstshould happen in India.     In this connection it would be idle to ignore the  fact that the chances of increaseddisturbance not only in India but in every theatre must be enhanced by the unfortunateincidents which have lately occurred at the Peace Conference, following on a long periodof uncertainty and delay.     The sharp divergence of view between the various Allied  and Associated powers which has now been advertised  to the world at large is more than likely to re-act on every centre of  disturbance from  Ireland to  the Far East, and it would be foolish to ignore the possibility of aggravated trouble occurring at all  danger points more or lesssimultaneously.     In these circumstances I venture to suggest the following proposals  for the earnestconsideration of the War Cabinet:      (i.)  I have  for  a long time  past  consistently urged that all military commitments            not  vital  to  the  British  Empire  should be  cut  down with a view to            concentrating all available troops  at the essential points.  *In pursuance  of            this policy we are already clear of Italy and the  Balkans.  There  remain to            be considered .                                    (a.) The Caucasus.                                    (b.) Syria.                As regards  (a) the  task for which a British Division was sent to the            Caucasus,  viz., the evacuation  of the  Turks and  Germans,  has  been            accomplished  and  nothing is to  be  gained by delaying the withdrawal  of            our  troops.  On the contrary, every day  that we stay there sees&apos;us more            deeply  committed and makes-it more difficult to  disentangle  ourselves.   The            alleged intention of the  Italians  to take over  this hornefs nest is hardly a            sufficient reason for further delay.     (7107)
                As regards (b) it appears certain that whatever  the  ultimate destiny    )           of Cilicia and Syria may be it will not fall to the British to take charge of           those countries.   The moment seems opportune therefore  to withdraw our           troops from the area north of Damascus, in which we have at present over           22,000  men, including 6,500 British (vide&apos; Appendix  B).   It will be for           France, assisted by Italy, to assume control of the area, and in view of the           emphatic  claims  which France has always made  to control this territory,           she  cannot reasonably object to taking it over.  General Allenby would           then be able to organize and consolidate the Northern frontier of Palestine,           which is strategically the Northern frontier of Egypt, in the  most efficient           and  economical manner.  He would also be freed from interminable causes           of friction and the petty pin-pricks which  the French at present appear to           delight in.     (ii.) Our policy at the Peace Conference in regard to Turkey should be  framed as           far as possible to spare the religious susceptibilities of our Mohammedan           subjects in India.   It will be remembered  that  one  of the  ominous  signs           reported by the Yiceroy is the fraternization of Hindus and Mohammedans,           and  the unrest caused amongst the latter  by the threatened extinction of           Turkey as a Sovereign  State.  This same phenomenon  occurred before the           Indian Mutiny.    (iii.) Lastly  we must face the fact (and prepare public opinion to  face  the  fact)           that we may be called on in the near future to furnish a military effort in           defence of vital British interests  that is beyond the strength of the forces           now  available, and that it may therefore  be  necessary to have recourse to           some form  of remobilization, that is to say compulsion.     I do not consider that any  form of voluntary enlistment will give us the men we want in the time events  may grant us, for  when the emergency  arises we must havetrained  men, men of the right age,  and men of the right qualifications  for the differentarms and branches  and for  the  essential services of maintenance which are the most difficult to fill.   Some form of compulsion will therefore be necessary.     I am aware of the  grave  objections to such a  course, and I would  hesitate torecommend  it  to the War  Cabinet were I not convinced that there is a  seriouspossibility of the emergency arising.     It  is for the  Cabinet  to  decide what  course to adopt.  In this paper  I  have outlined in the briefest possible manner our present  situation and our possible future action, and I have shown  that  should the contingencies  arise which are considered aspossible by the highest authorities in England,  Ireland,  Egypt and India then, in myopinion, we have not the necessary military force to ensure the safety of the Empire.
