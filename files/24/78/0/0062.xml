I am directed to forward herewith, tho  following report cn the work of the Local Government  Board during  themonth of March.                      Yours faithfully,                          H.  C MOKRO.The Secretary,   The  War  Cabinet.Secretary.                    I.  HOUSING.    * (1)  The efforts of the Department during the  month havebeen primarily directed towards the preparation of  the  housing bill;  the completion of the organisation of the central machinery for dealing with housing;  and the settlement of  theterms of financial assistance to  be given to Public UtilitySocieties.     (2)  Housing Bill - The Housing Bill was introduced onthe 18th March.   The principal provisions are - a definiteobligation on Local Authorities to provide new houses,  whererequired and to  abolish slums;  powers  to act in default ofa Local Authority;  financial assistance to Looal Authoritiesand to Fublio Utility Societies;   over-riding of vexatiousbye-laws; provisions for shortening procedure for Town  Planning;extension cf facilities for the acquisition of houses bytenants.  Provisions as to valuation and assessment of  oompen-sation in the case of compulsory  acquisition of land are contained in the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensa-tioii) Bill.          The Housing Bill has now passed the second reading and was received with marked approval.     (3)  Central Organisation -  The special organisation which is being set up, with Sir James Carmichael as Director-General, is  now nearly completed.   Ten  cf the eleven DistrictHousing Commissioners have already been appointed,  and  are  atwork with their  staffs, the only  outstanding appointment being that fcr the Metropolitan District.          The orgar.isa.tion is designed  to secure that schemes in respect of which grant is to be paid are reasonably  good,are economical,  and are carried through with despatch.  Thework cf dealing  with schemes will  be largely decentralised,wide powers  being given to the District Commissioners.:  Thelatter will  have a staff of technical experts.   Jn  order toreduce to a minimum the time spent in preparing and
sanctioning schemes, it will be the duty of the DistrictHousing Commissioners and their technical ani other assistantsto keep in close personal touch with Local Authorities and,whenvor possible, to deal with any difficulties personallyand thus to avoid the delay which is inevitable in dealingwith these matters &quot;by  correspondence.     (4)  Public Utility Societies - It is hoped that a sub-Utan^ial oontrioution .towards*The&quot;&quot;ssttlement of the housingproblem will &quot;be provided &quot;by the Public Utility Societies,          Under the scheme whioh has &quot;been agreed to &quot;by theTreasury, assistance may &quot;be given to any Society which has forits object, or one of its objects, the provision cf houses forthe working classes;  is registered under tho Industrial andProvident Societies Act, 1893;  is &quot;by its Rules prohibited from paying a higher rate of interest or dividend  than 6%(the present limit  is b%\  6%  is proposed in the Housing Bill):and complies with Regulations,  The Regulations which will &quot;bemade &quot;by the Beard under the Housing Bill will follow therecommendations of  the Hobhouse Corcmittee, and will providesafeguards for the  interests of the tenants  and of thecommunity.          It is proposed that  assistance shall &quot;be  given by wayof leans  and subsidies.  &quot;Where necessary and subject to certain conditions, three-fourths of the  total cost  of a housing scheme may be bcrrowoi from the Public Works Loans  Commissioners,  the loans will be made  for a period not exceeding  fifty years  andbe repayable by instalments on the  annuity system.          In addition, and whether  the necessary capital hasb*er. &quot;borrowed from  the State or privately raised,  the Govern-ment Will grant an  annual subsidy  equal  to 40  per  cent,  of the annual  charges  (interest and capital  repayment) on three- fourths  of  the  capital raised  in  respect of  an  approvedhousing schome.   Practically the  assistance  amounts  to meeting a third of the  cost of a housing  scheme.           A memorandum (oopy annexed;   appendix I) has been circulated giving full particulars  of these  arrangements.      (5)  Building  Material  -  Special measures have  he en taken to eecuro an  adequate  supply of building material  so  that  local authorities  and others  shall not  find,  when  they have their schemes completed,  that  the necessary materials cannot he obtained.  ?he  Director  cf Building Materials  Supply, Ministry of Munitions,  acting for the Board,  is  stimulating the  supply cf &quot;bricks ar,d hopes to secure  the production within  a year of three  thousand  millions  and  in the following year  of five thousand millions.   Steps  are  also being taken tc  standardise certain articles  for use  in  the  government housing scheme with a viejr to  securing  economy  ani a sufficient  supply,      (6)   rogross  it  Housing  Schemes,- The  table  in appendix II gives information of the  progress  of housing schemes  up to the 5th Aprilo   693 schemes  in all had been  submitted up to that date,  exolusivo of schemes  whioh had been abandoned or rejocted.  In  most  of the  cases  the proposals  have not  advanced beyond the first  stage,  an  application for  the approval  of a site for housing;  it  has  to  be  remembered in  this connection that the financial  terms  to  local authorities  were announced only on the 6th February last.           224 schemes  fcr  sites  have  already been approved;   52 schemes for lay-outs (out  of 182 applications),  and 49  schemes
fcr house plans with 2133 houses (out of 146 applications).The appointment of the District Housing Commissioners and the wide powers delegated to them are designed to expedite dealingwith applications.          As an indication cf the progress, which is being made,no less than 275 schemes were submitted to the Board withinthe four weeks ended the 5th instant.  The available informa-ticn shows that local authorities generally are proceedingenergetically with their proposals.          It is estimated that the 693 schemes already sub-aiVoj. provide&apos; sites for some 120,000 houses.     (7)  The King and Queen are evincing great interest inthe housing movement;  and the King addressed a meeting on the subject, held at Buckingham Palace on the 11th instant, ofrepresentatives of the London County Council, the CountyCouncils Association, the Associations of Municipal Corpora-tions, the Urban District Councils Association, the rural district Councils Association and the National Housing and town Planning Council.  The personal interest taken in themattar by  thd ring and queen will help materially to stimulate the progress of housing measures.                    II.  jgALTIi.    -  [l)  Ministry  o  Health Bill.  The Bill has passed through Standing  Orjunittee  A of  -he House cf Commons.  The principal-alterations which have been mado provide  (a) for the definite transfer  to the new Ministry of  all the powers and duties of the Beard if Education with respect to the  medical inspection and treatment  of children  ani young persons, instead of leaving these  matters  open t* subsequent  transfer by Order in Council;   (b)  that  there  shall be a Board cf Health in Wales under the Minister;  and  jo  that any Order in Council trans - ferring powers and  duties&quot;from or to other Government Depart- ments shall not take effect until adopted, with or without modification,  by resolution of both Houses.          ^he  Bill  has since been read  a  third time in the House of Commons and sent without material alteration to  the Ho use of Lords.      (2)   Influenza.   The  third  wave of the influenza epidemic reached its height  ?eherally at  the end of February and has now fallen, again  to Ltsce  level.   It was less severe than  the Autumn wave,  and  it is io  be hoped  any  succeeding wave will be cf still less  intensify.           The following ^able  shows the total  deaths  from influenza in  the  96 grea.i  towns  of England and Wales  during the last nine weeks, and ^he  death  rate per  thousand  per  year from all causes in  those &apos;yowns:
Influenza                1919 Pel.. 1  &quot;   8  &quot;  15  &quot;  22March 1  &quot;   8  &quot;  15  &quot;  22  &quot;  29April 5  272  6041,3633,0463,8893,2182,3201,341  886  56917.221.027.835.735.731,926.420.91J. 317.915,015.714.816.715.716.717.017.016.516,5          A large amount of work has &quot;been done in thecollection of information and the consideration and investiga-tion cf matters connected with the outbreak, both at home andabroad, including intensive local enquiry under the personaldirection of the Board1s Medical Inspectors in a number ofdistricts.  An Emergency Committee on Influenza meets weeklyat the Local Government Board for comparison of data with theMedical Research Committee, the Medical Departments of theArmy and Navy, and with other authorities.     (3)  Tuberculosis   An Inter-departmental Committee hasbeen appointed, in oo-operation with tho Ministry of Pensions,&quot;to consider and report upon the immediate practical stopswhich should be taken for the provision cf residentialtreatment for discharged soldiers and sailors suffering frompulmonary tuberculosis and for their re-introduction intoemployment, especially on the land&quot;.  Major Astor will actas Chairman of the Committee.          At the end of the month 256 disabled men and 1,369insured persons were on the waiting list for admission toTuberculosis Sanatoria,  Th/v number of vacant beds in thoSanatoria and Hospitals in different parts of England andWales at the same time was 497.          The total number of institutions for the treatmentof tuberculosis approved by the Board up to the ond of Marchwa3 506 Sanatoria and other Institutions provided by LocalAuthorities with 7,030 beds, and 204 voluntary Institutions,with 6,480 beds.  Of these Institutions, 349 provided by LocalAuthorities and 33 of the Voluntary Institutions are dispensariesonly.          In 1915 the Treasury decided that ns new capital grants should be made or premised in aid of the provision of residential institutions for the treatment of tuberculosis,Early in 1918, it begun to be clear that the amount of residential accommodation was becoming inadequate, havingregard to the number of discharged service men needingresidential treatment.  Negotiations were opened with theTreasury which led to the issue of the Circular of 25th Ootoberlast offering new oapital grants.  Councils had been urged tomake further provision for this purpose in anticipation ofthe&quot;Board1s Circular letter and proposals are now under con-sideration for the provision of.some 1,500 beds at a cost ofapproximately  250,000.          The grants for oapital expenditure paid during., theyear ended March, 1919, to Local Authorities in England(County Councils, County Borough Councils, metropolitan borough Councils) amounted to  26,500 bringing the total                                                             lit  &quot;Week ended  Deaths from  -Death rate from, all causes                                        Corresponding                                         week,&quot; 191.8.
capital grants to  364,000,  Farther capital grants havealready heen promised to the extent of  115,000.          The total amount of maintenance grants  paid &quot;by the beard during the financial year just ended  (which areadditional to the capital grants) amounted to  457,000.   the gross expenditure of Local Authorities in the year 1917-18amounted to just cvor  1,000,000;  that in raspeot of theyear 1916-19 is estimated to reach  1,300,000.  These amountsare exclusive of capital expenditure.          A report on the share of &quot;Colonies&quot; in  the treatment%t tuberculosis, by Dr. Chapman one of the Board1s MedicalInspectors, has been issued.  At present Colonies usually dealwith the mere hopeful cases only.  They afford prolongedtreatment, under simplified sanatorium conditions;  and providethe inmates with suitable employment, or training in newoccupations at whioh they oan earn a  living after discharge.If the utility of training eclcnies is net  to be  limited topatients without dependants or ex-service men with pensions,arrangements must be made for the maintenance of dependantsduring the residenoe of breadwinners  in the Colony.          Dr. Chapman suggests that suitably situated coloniesjoight be used with advantage  (a) as half-way houses betweenthe Sanatorium  and ordinary life for  patients who are liableto early relapse and  (b) for  the accommodation of irrecoverablepatients whose working capacity  is temporarily or permanentlyimpaired.  In the latter case the provision of suitable parttime work  and of suitable housing for the patients and their families are needed.  Dr. Chapman points  out that experience in every class  of Colony treatment is somewhat limited andrecommends that  local schemes should  be begun *n  a relatively small  seale  and be developed  in  the light of experience.           The report  includes a  section on  the housing oftuberculous  patients  and plans for suitable cottages for thispurpose.      (4)  Milk  Supply.  Special  consideration is  being given,in conjunction  with the Ministry of Food, to  the  question ofthe  future arrangements for the  control of  the milk  supply.Various  schemes  for dealing with the  general  control of milkas a  permanent  institution  are under  discussion.           Draft  regulations undor  the Milk  and Dairies Con-solidation Aot,  1915,  (which  is  not  yet  in  operation) havebeen  prepared and  referred to a  Sub-Committee of the Committeeon the Production  and Distribution  of Lilk.  This Subcommitteehas met  several times  and  it  is  hoped that  they  will be  in  aposition&apos;to  report  at  an early  date.      (5)   Infeotious  Piseasea,   Measures  are  being taken  toprevent  the  introduction of infectious  diseases  by personsentering the country  from  abroad.   A conference  on the  subject was  reoently held  with representatives  and  officers  of  PortSanitary Authorities,  when it was  stated that the Board&apos;smedical  advisers considered that the  prevalence  of typhus,small-pcx and other infectious  diseases  on  the Continent,especially in the  East  of  Europe,  make  it essential that  theutmost vigilance should be exercised to  prevent  the  importa-ticn  of  infectious  diseases with the resumption  of passenger traffic.   The Board promises  that  steps  would be taken  tostrengthen the  powers and  duties of Port Sanitary Authoritiesso  far as  may be necessary for  this  purpose.
          The conference also discussed tho arrangements whichwill be necessary for the medical examination of aliens inconnection with proposed legislation, and it was intimated that, on the establishment of the Ministry of Health, measures would be taken to combine, under the direction of that Ministry,the present medical work of Pert Sanitary Authorities and themedical examination of aliens.          The.&quot;special risks *ef the introduction of infectious diseases; en demobilisation, or as a result of conditionsattending demobilisation,&apos; are reviewed at frequent intervalsby an Inter-Departmental Committee, of whioh Major Astor isChairman.  This Committee bus given special attention to the efficacy .*f the various measures advocated for the preventionof venereal diseases,          A circular has been issued to the Authorities ofTreatment Centres for Venereal Diseases., emphasising the needfor a uniformly high standard and for continuity of treatment,and forwarding, for the information of the Medical Officers,(a) a memorandum prepared by.the Salvarsan Committee -en theadministration of Salvarsan and its substitutes, and (b) astatement of typical courses of treatment carried out at certain Centres.          At the end of March 135 Main Treatment Centres forVenereal Diseases., 8 Hostels and 60 Auxiliary Treatment Centreswere open.  The estimated expenditure by Local Authorities inEngland and Wales during the year 1918-19 amounted to  225,000,Of which 75$ will be repayable by grants from the Exchequer.          There havfe been a few local outbreaks of smallpox,put its spread has been prevented by the measures which havebeen taken.          Memoranda on influenza, malaria., encephalitislethargica, tuberculosis and venereal diseases have beenprepare* and Submitted to the Inter-Allied Sanitary Conferenceat Paris,          special  regulations relating to the notification ofmalaria came into operation on 1st March.  Detailed advioe isbeing issued te Medical Officers of Health and to LocalAuthorities as te the steps necessary te prevent infectionarising in this country from demobilised men affected bymalaria,  Furthermore, a pamphlet on the care and treatmentof malaria has been prepared in collaboration with the WarOffioe and the Ministries of Pensions and of National Service,and will be issue-d by the Ministry ef Pensions to all medical practitioners throughout the country.     (6)  Registration of Fursee.  The Nurses RegistrationBill which was&apos; read a second time on the 28th March, has been carefully considered in the Departmtent, and,, as a result, theGovernment have expressed their general acceptance of theprinciples of the Bill.  It was made clear that such acceptancewas subject to full examination and amendment in Committee andthat the attitude of the Government towards the measure atlater stages would,depend upon the shape in which it leavesCommittee.
III.   uOTSRATJ . tMillW0%$^^                             that are to oojutitnxte the new Ministry of Health, Sir Rtftert Morant, K.C.B.. the dhedriaafi of the National Health Insurance Gftutfclasion, and Mr. John Andersen,  3.3.,  Secretary to that Commission and at present acting a&amp;  secretary to the Ministry of Shipping, have &quot;been appointed as  additional Secretaries to the Beard while coritirrjing their present functions.           Sir Robert Mcrant and Mr./John Anderson have been teslcnated to be First  and Second Secretaries, respectively, of* the new Ministry when established.      (&amp;)  loans for Public W^rks.   During the month 117 appli- Gations V/ Local Authorities for sanction to loans have been r^rtivod as compared with 93 applications during February and 38 during January.           Early in  March the Treasury further relaxed the Restrictions en borrowing and empowered the Board to sanction, Up to a total of  6,000,000 and without referring the individual applications  to the Treasury, the borrowing of money for various kinds  of work which will afford a variety of -rmpltyr^nt.  As  a result of this relaxation the Board have been able to sanotion during the month loans which have amounted to  967,000 as  oompared with  286,000 in February and  57,000 in Jarruary.   Since the end of the period covered by this Report, the Treasury restrictions have been altogether withdrawn,           The withdrawal of the restrictions will operate to remove the financial uncertainty whioh, together with the Uncertainty of ths  present general conditions, has deterred Local Authorities  from  proceeding with the very large amount of public wr/rk (electricity work,  water work, road works, eto) for whish sanotion  has already been obtained.           It has been  decided that,  for the present, it is to *be made a condition cf  sanction that the works in question shall be begun immediately and that,  in all cases where the total expenditure i3  estimated to  amount to  50,000 or more, the loan to be sanctioned shall be limited to the amount of nine months&apos; expenditure.           It has &quot;teen ascertained, from enquiries which have been made, that public works  by loeal authorities te the value cf  15,000,000 in all vdiich have already been sanctioned (most of these under Local  A^ts  passed beforo the War)  have not yet been carried out, having been suspended during the war.  Local Authorities are apparently desirous  of proceeding with a large part of these public  works;   and it  is hoped that, with the relaxation of the restrictions  on  borrowing,  a considerable amount of work will be undertaken  within a short  time.   Most of the sanctioned public work3  are for water undertakings, road works,  sewerage  works,  and electricity undertakings.           In addition, there  is  a  large amount of other publicwork which local authorities  are prepared to undertake  whan plans  have  been completed  and sanction obtained.           the Board  are  keeping  in touch with the Ministry ofLabour  as  regards un employ rear?, t,  and Engineering Inspectorshave been  sent  to the places  where unemployment is mostserious in  order to s-tdjaulate  the  local authorities  to  procecc
with public works.  Among the places on which reports havealready been made are:- Birmingham, Blackburn, Bristol,Burnley, Bury, Darlington&quot;, Gateshead, Hull, Leeds, Manchester,Newcastle-on-Tyhe, Newport, Nottingham, Rotherham, Sheffield,Southampton, Stockton and Swansea.          A report on the subject of Public Works was prepared for the Committee of the Industrial Conference which dealt with unemployment.     (3)  War Memorials.  Question has been raised as to expenditure by Local Authorities on War Memorials.  Theprovision of certain kinds of Memorials (e,g, recreation grounds, libraries, hospitals) is ordinarily within thestatutory powers of a Local Authority.  The Board haveintimated their willingness to sanction, where necessary,expenditure by Local Authorities for useful purposes.  Theyconsider, however, that application for voluntary subscriptionsshould be encouraged;  and that, before any project is under-taken which involves a large expenditure by a Local Authority,the general opinion of the inhabitants should be ascertained.          An Order is .also to be issued authorising reasonableexpenditure by Local Authorities in connection with the celebrations-bration of Peace.     (4)  Relief of War Distress.  The following grants havebeen made from the National Relief Fund on the recommendationof the Government Committee during the month cf Ivlaroh -   To Local Representative Committees for the       provision of direct assistanoe .............   To Local Representative Committees for the       relief of air raid distress................   To Canadian Fund Committees for the special       East Coast relief soheme...................   To the Central Charities Committee for the       relief of repatriated British civilians ....   For the relief of distress among the       professional classes.......................          A special review of cases which are still receivingassistance from this source is to be undertaken in order to distinguish clearly between cases where assistance is neededbecause of the War and cases where the need arises fromchronic poverty.          As regards repatriated British Civilians, two hostelshave been in use for their reception and maintenance where necessary.  One hostel has now been given up;  it is not practicable to close the other yet, especially as a few morerepatriated British Civilians are expected from Belgium butit is hoped that it will be possible to release it shortly.          Great difficulty is being experienced in findingemployment or accommodation for  some of the repatriated personsbecause of their German accents  or habits.  A number ofpersons, also, will require permanent assistance;  and theadoption of special measures to  meet this need is beingconsidered with the Chairman of  the Repatriated BritishCivilian Health Committee.7,930  2001,3501,0003,175
          A large proportion of the monies whioh are nowbeing distributed from the National Relief Fund in ordinarycases is for persons in East Coast watering places which have.suffered exceptionally.  In addition to the assistance fromthe Fund in individual cases,  grants have been made to theLocal Authorities by the Treasury from time to time towardsthe loss in rates, etc.  A further final grant of  100,000 hasnow been made, making a total with the previous grants of 890,000.     (5)  Re patr i at ion jpT Eelgi an Re f uge ea.  During March 17,000more refugees have been repatriated at the expense of theGovernment and some 12,000 more have paid their own fares,bringing the total number repatriated to 90,000.  It isestimated that there are 17,000 to return to Belgium duringthe month of April, at the end of which month the government service will in all probability be withdrawn.  The effect ofthis progress in repatriation is strikingly shown by the factthat the cost to the Government of assistance to refugeeswhich was in January last  17,700 a week had dropped by theend of march  to  6,570 a week.          In carrying out the repatriation of the refugees,eonsiderable difficulties have had to be overeome.  The chiefof these were:-   (a) Shipping facilities.  These were at first much restricted.    Only one port in Belgium was available (Antwerp) and the    only ships that could be provided were those employed in    bringing repatriated prisoners from Germany through    Holland.  It was two months before the port of Ostend was    open for refugee traffic.  Regular services of steamers    are now engaged in the work.   (b) passports and permits.  Grert difficulty was foreseen in    supplying every refugee with a passport and permit in the    ordinary way, and it was ultimately arranged that each    refugee should have a large white card which should pass    him cn to the boat, serve as his authority to land in    Belgium, and frank him on the Belgian railways to his home,   (c) Collection of the refugees and their luggage.   Each    refugee was allowed 300 lbs. of luggage and the collection    and manipulation of this constituted a large undertaking.      e difficulties were solved largely by the aid of the      lgian refugee committees in populous centres.  These    committees agreed  to make all local arrangements for the    refugees in their  areas, to collect their application forrn^    for free transport, to prepare embarkation forms for    transmission to the Transport Department at Aldwych, to    warn the people of the date of departure and to arrange    for the baggage.          On receipt of information from a local Committee that    they had a large party ready for return, special trains    were arranged to take the party to the Port, where they were    met by members of  the Embarkation Staff of the Transport    Department, and allocated to their cabins, or berths on    board ship.      (6)  Pauperism.   The report on the course of pauperismduring the Quarter ended December last, which was issued during march, shows two significant facts -   (a) The large increase, in consequence of the influenza    epidemic, in the number of persons seeking relief.  The
\    increases follow closely the course of the  epidemic.  Thus    in London where the incioence of influenza  was  felt early,    there was a rise during October of 1,400  in the number  of    persons receiving relief when,  apart from the  influenza    epidemic a fall was to be &amp;xpe6ted.  In the provinces    (following the later incidence, generally of influenza)    there was a rise of 7,700 in November instead  of a much    smaller normal increase.  (b)  The exceptional course of pauperism in  some  of the    South Wales and Monmouthshire districts,  whereas in    the country generally pauperism showed a  heavy reduction    on the previous year, in these  districts, chiefly mining    areas, there was a large rise for whioh there  seems nd    good reasons other than mnt of administrative strictness.          It may be added that there is no foundationgenerally for the statement which has recently  been made  thatthe high cost of living has driven  large numbers of old age pensioners into Poor Law Institutions,  The number of personsovsr 70 years of age in receipt of indoor relief hasprogressively fallen from 48,000 at the beginning  of 1914 to36,000 at the end of 1918,          During the war accommodation for military patients in Poor Law Institutions was provided to the  extent of about73,500 beds,  This aoeommodation is now gradually  being returned to the GuardianB,  During March some 2,800 beds  havebeen set free, bringing the total returned to 7,800 and leaving some 65,600 still in military occupation.

HOUSING.FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO PUBLIC UTILITY SOCIETIES.  In the circular letter addressed by the Local Government Board to Loca\Authorities in England and Wales on the 6th February, it was announcedthat with  a view  to  supplementing  the provision  of houses by  LocalAuthorities, the  Government desire to encourage  Public Utility Societiesto undertake building operations, and that it was accordingly their inten-tion to propose to. Parliament that financial assistance  should) be given tosuch Societies who submit schemes for  the erection of working-class dwell-ings within a specified time, and carry them out within two years or such further period  as  may  be approved  by the  Local  Government Board.Provisions  to this end have been included in the Housing Bill which  is atpresent before Parliament.  The  Government are satisfied that much can be done to meet the urgenthousing needs of the moment  by Public Utility Societies formed or to be formed for the provision of working-class houses.   A number of Societiesare already in  existence,  though  their activities have  necessarily  been limited during the Avar, and it is hoped1 not only that the existing Societieswill extend their operations, but also  that  many  industrial organisations and others  interested in the provision of working-class houses will promote the formation of new  societies.  Employers of  labour  in both  industrial and rural areas are, no doubt,  alive to the advantages of securing adequatehousing accommodation for their employees under an arrangement which gives  the latter,  as  members of a  Public Utility  Society, a voice in themanagement of their houses.    1. SOCIETIES ELIGIBLE FOR FINANCIAL  ASSISTANCE.  In order to rank as a Public Utility Society eligible for  financial assistancea Society.   (A) must have for its object, or one of its objects, the provision of houses for the working classes;  (B) must be registered under the Industrial and  Provident Societies Act,.1.893, or any amendment thereof;  (c) must by its Rules prohibit the payment of  interest or  dividend ata rate  exceeding the statutory limit ;* and  (D)  must comply with regulations to be made by the Local  GovernmentBoard, with  the approval  of  the Treasury, under the provisions of theHousing Bill.  These  regulations will,  subject  to  certain  modifications,  embody theconditions  and safeguards recommended by  the  Housing  (Financial  Assis-tance)  Committee 5  and set out at  the end  of this memorandum,  and theRules of the Society should be  so framed  as to secure compliance with theregulations.             2.-TERMS OF  FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE.  To  a Public  Utility Society which complies with the  conditions  aboveindicated, the financial assistance to be granted  in respect  of  a  housing scheme approved by the Local Government  Board and  carried out withinthe prescribed period will take the following forms:                            Baising of  Capital.  The  Public &quot;Works Loan  Commissioners will  be authorised to  advance on the recommendation  of  the Local Government Board so  much of thecapital recpiired as in the opinion of the Board  the Society cannot reason-ably be expected to raise from private sources; but  the total amount soadvanced will in no case exceed three quarters of the total cost of theacquisition of the land, the development of the site and  the erection of thehouses, as shown by the accepted tenders.  * At present the statutory limit imposed by Section 4 of the Housing and Town Planning,&amp;c, Act, 1909, is 5 per cent., but under the Housing  Bill it  is proposed to authorise thepayment of interest oi dividend up to a maximum of 6 per cent.  g Copies of the Interim Report of this Committee, Cd. 9223, can  be obtained throughany bookseller  or  directly  from His Majestv&apos;s Stationery Office, Imperial  House,Kingsway, W.C.2, or 28, Abingdon Street, S.W.I.&quot;(22381.) &apos; Wt. 48638-267. 20,000.  3/19.

  The  loan will be advanced  at  the  rate at which  advances are, for thetime being, made to Local Authorities by the Public Works Loan Commis-sioners for assisted housing schemes.   It will run for a period not exceeding50 years and the repayment of principal and interest, which will be a first charge upon the property, will be on the annuity system.  It is proposed to arrange for advances to be made by instalments, as thework proceeds, on the certificate of an architect or  surveyor approved bythe Local Government Board,  but before advancing each instalment thePublic  Works Loan  Commissioners  will require to be  satisfied  that  a proportionate instalment of the capital to be privately subscribed has been raised.  The advances in respect  of unfinished houses will not in any caseexceed 50 per cent, of the cost represented by the work done.  If in the  opinion of the Public Works Loan  Commissioners there  is aspecial risk  that it may at some future date during the currency  of theloan be impossible to secure tenants  for a large proportion  of the  housesowing to changes in the industrial circumstances of  the locality,  it will beopen to them to require collateral security.                          Exchequer Subsidy.  (1) In addition to the  advance of  capital above mentioned, an annualsubsidy will be paid during the currency of the loan by the  Local Govern-ment Board in consideration  of  the  abnormal cost  of building houses atthe present time.  The subsidy will be an amount equal to 40 per cent, ofthe annual charges on three-quarters  of  the total capital  raised in respectof the approved  scheme, and,  for the purpose of calculation, the chargeswill  be reckoned on the  basis  of  the Public Works Loan Commissioners&apos;terms for repayment of principal  and interest  by equal half-yearly  instal-ments, from whatever source the capital may in fact  have  been raised.  (2) While the  amount of the subsidy will be determined  on  the basisabove described, the Local Government  Board will  reserve  to themselves the right of  reducing the subsidy in any case in which there is evidenceof failure on the part of the Society to secure due economy in the erection of the  houses.  (3) Any Society seeking financial assistance will be required to give anundertaking in legal form that, after  the loan has been paid off, any profits of the  Society in excess of 6 per cent, shall be devoted in whole or in partas may be required by the Local Government Board towards the repayment of sums received from the Exchequer by way of subsidy during the currency of the  loan; and that in the event of  the property being sold, either before or after the loan has been paid off, the Society will  as a condition of suchsale, after paying-off outstanding charges (if any) and shares at  par, repayif so required by  the  Local Government Board  the whole or part  of theExchequer subsidies.                          3. PROCEDURE.  (1) The Housing Commissioner  for the district will be ready to  adviseany  persons proposing to form a Public Utility Society  for housing pur-poses as to the Pules of the Society  and to arrange for a conference withthe Local Authority  with  a view to  ascertaining what assistance may be looked  for from the Local Authority, both in the shape of  advances of capi-tal and in regard to sewerage, water  supply and other public services.  (2) The advice of the  Commissioner and his expert staff  will  be  at thedisposal  of the  Society in regard to  the selection of a site, and the pro-posals  of the  Society as to this  and  the general outlines of their  scheme should be submitted to the Commissioner at the earliest stage.  (3) If  the proposals are such as in the opinion of the Commissioner arelikely to  be  approved by  the Local  Government Board, plans should beprepared on the advice  of a  properly qualified architect for the  lay-outof the  site and for.the houses,  of which there should ordinarily be approxi-mately 12 to the acre in urban areas  and 8 in agricultural areas.  Where  possible  an option to purchase the suggested site  should be ob-tained and the purchase should  not  be  completed until the site has  beeninspected and approved.  (4) Before giving their  formal approval  to  schemes  the  Board will re-quire to be  furnished with plans  and estimates, a statement of  the rentsproposed to be charged and information as to the Society&apos;s share  and othercapital together with a copy of the Registered Rules.  But if the procedure
above described is followed the preliminary steps can be taken in consulta-tion with the Commissioner, and the schemes can be dealt with by stagesand  delay thus avoided.  (5) In order to promote  economy  and  to  assist  those  engaged in theprovision of houses for the working classes steps have been taken to securesupplies  of  certain  building materials  and  standardised  fittings, whichwill  be  available  for  the use of Public  Utility Societies.  There  need,therefore, be no hesitation in proceeding with the preparation of  schemeson account of an  anticipated shortage of materials.  The Board are issuinga Manual which  will contain further  information on this subject as wellas detailed proposals in regard  to the  preparation  and submission  ofschemes and  suggestions  as to lay-out, with designs and plans.  Recommendations as to safeguards contained in the Report  of the Hous-ing (Financial Assistance) Committee of  the Ministry of Reconstruction.     (i.) All tenants should be entitled (though not required) to become          shareholders of the Society on equal terms.     (ii.) Tenant  members should have the right to elect annually a Tenant          Members&apos;  Committee, each tenant having one vote.    (iii.) At  least one-quarter of the  Board of Management should be          appointed by the. Tenant Members&apos; Committee.    (iv.) Holders of loan stock should only be entitled to vote at a Society&apos;s          meeting if they are shareholders,  and only to give a  vote  in          respect of loan stock representing at least five times  the capital          represented by a  share vote.     (v.) Security of tenure should be provided for.  A tenant should only          be given notice to quit for (A)  non-payment  of rent, or  (u) acts          or defaults tending to the detriment of the property, or (c) bad          neighbourship.   Nothing  in this clause should prevent a ter-          mination of a tenancy for failure  to pay  an increased  rent  in          cases where the  increase has been  approved  by  the  Central          Authority.   The question  of whether a tenant  has been guilty          of  bad neighbourship should  be  determined  by  the  Tenant          Members&apos;  Committee.    (vi.) The lay-out and design of the houses should be approved by the          Central Authority, and the same authority should supervise the          carrying out of the plans (either directly or through the agency          of  the  Local Authority).   (vii.) Profits,  over and above the maximum rate allowed,  should after          due provision  for  Reserve Fund, be used for the benefit of the          tenants generally.   (viii.) Rents should be approved by the Central Authority.    (ix.) Societies should not be allowed to sell  houses, except subject  to          the consent of, and under conditions laid down by, the  Central          Authority.     (x.) Building contracts  should be approved by the Central Authority.    (xi.) Professional charges paid by Societies should not exceed a fixed          percentage on  cost, and management expenses should not exceed          a fixed percentage on gross rental.   (xii.) The accounts  should  be audited and  certified  by  a  District          Auditor, or other  Auditor appointed by  the Government (who          should  have the power of  surcharge) and filed with the  Central          Authority and the Local Authority of the District, with the right          of inspection by the public.   (xiii.) On  the  dissolution  of a society  the  Local Authority  should have          the right of pre-emption at a figure  sufficient to pay off shares  at          par, loans, loan stock and debts. If this right  is not exercised          the estate should be sold by public auction and  any  surplus          remaining, after discharging all obligations, be paid to the Local          Authority, and by it applied for housing or other like purposes.  All communications with reference to  this  Memorandum should  beaddressed to the Local Government Board, Whitehall, S.W.1, or, in  the caseof Scotland, to the Local Government Board for Scotland, Edinburgh.    24th.
