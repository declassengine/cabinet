Gen. No.WAR  CABINET,                                                                               802T  7134  I circulate for the consideration of the Cabinet a note by the General Staff.                                              WINSTON  S.  CHURCHILL.mh April, 1919.     1. The  number  of Russian  prisoners  of war in Germany at the present time isestimated to be about 500,000.   Should they be repatriated direct to Soviet Russia,there appear to be  two  possible routes, (a) vid East Prussia, to Kovno and 7ilna;(b) through Poland.     2. It should be noted that the great majority of theae prisoners of war are trainedsoldiers, while amongst the officers will  be found representatives of all branches andranks.   There may not be  more  than 1,500  officers,  as it is believed the Germansdeliberately  sent them over to the Russians.     3. The  effect  produced,  should  these prisoners be  repatriated by  the routesmentioned above, will probably be as follows :      (a.)  The whole of the rank and file will be  forced to join the  Bolshevik forces  in           order to escape starvation.   It must be  remembered that, the food supply           being in the hands  of the Soviet Government, the latter use it as a  weapon           in order to force men into the ranks of the army.     (b.) Any pronounced anti-Bolshevik elements will in  all probability be  denounced           by the  more rabid of the Bolshevik  elements and will be shot.  Similarly,           any officers who refuse to serve will meet with no mercy.     (c.) If the repatriation takes place  through Poland  it will cause a most  difficult           situation,  since from  the  vicinity of  Grodno, southwards, there is a           defensive line  of Polish troops and the returning prisoners will have to pass           through them.  A  certain number will, in all  probability attempt to escape           into Poland to avoid death  from the Bolsheviks, while the arrival of hordes           of Russians on the front will give  the  later  an excellent opportunity for           obtaining intelligence  as to  Polish  dispositions and perhaps  of executing           surprise military operations.     (d.)  Should the  repatriation take  place  through  East  Prussia to Vilna, the           returning prisoners must pass through Lithuania and through the defensive           line there, and results  similar to (c)  above are to be apprehended.     4. Our plans for the  feeding and eventual repatriation of the Russians in Germanyenvisaged their regeneration and eventual employment  as willing reinforcements for anti-Bolshevik forces  in Siberia, South Russia and North Russia,   There appears  to beno reason as yet to say that this is an improbable project, especially as we have at lastmanaged to establish the organization for dealing with  the matter in Germany.  Toaccept the present decision will therefore  not only  entail the above disadvantages, but will deny to the anti-Bolshevik Government large potential reinforcements.     5. Apart from the direct effect produced  on the  military situation by presenting the Bolsheviks with this potential reinforcement of half-a-million men, and at the  sametime, depriving the  anti-Bolshevik  forces of the possibility of employing  them, due consideration should be given to the moral effect produced upon loyal Russian elementsby this course of action.   The danger that the repatriation  of  this army of half-a-million men to Soviet Russia may be looked upon by Admiral Kolchak, General Denikin(B19/201)  70 4/19  H4S  7066wo
and General de Miller as a betrayal of their interests and  of the lives and  honour Softheir supporters among the prisoners is great, and it is probable that in after years with.Russia reconstituted and a Great Power again, such a feeling would  remain and mightpoison her relations with this country.     6. It should  not be forgotten that at the  present time, General Ironside at archangel  is urging the vital necessity of sending  Russian officers to that place toassist in the training and organizing of new Russian forces.   Similarly Russian officers are required in Siberia.   It would appear that the  Russian  officer prisoners  of war inGermany could be employed in both these theatres with great advantage if they were withdrawn from Germany and not sent into Soviet Russia.     7.  Although the  German Government  may  be forbidden  to  repatriate  anyoneagainst their will, experience has shown that engagements of this sort are not likely tobe adhered  to, and in reality, compulsory  repatriation  of all will take place at  once.GENERAL STAFF,       WAR  OFFICE,             16th April, 1919.
