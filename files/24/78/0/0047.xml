It was suggested in Part I of this Report some weeks ago that the Government willfor the  future have the strongest interest in the efficient and adequate organisation oflabour,  since only through such organisation can effective negotiation be carried on.  Itmay be convenient to examine this point somewhat more closely. Inadequate organisationresults in leaders who are not representative, who speak for a minority and not for themajority whose  views are never heard.   This is a defect  which is rapidly diminishing,but it will be realised that there is a long way still to go when it is remembered that theindustrial classes of this country  number  from twelve to fourteen  millions,  of  whomonly some five and a quarter millions are  organised to-day.   This is a very importantfact, but one that is apt to be forgotten because it is not directly seen.  The same is true of its effects,  which are likely to be  all the more  dangerous for that.  Moreover, theexisting organisation is  not distributed  evenly  over the whole field  of industry, but is highly-concentrated in certain parts coal-mining, engineering and shipbuilding, railways,for example leaving vast areas almost  untouched.    But for practical purposes inefficient organisation presents, at the moment at  anyrate, a  greater problem for the Ministry of Labour than  does incomplete organisation.The difficulties created  from a Governmental point of view by inefficient organisaion may be divided into two kinds.   First, those that arise from inefficient types of organisa-tion; secondly, those that arise from badly-defined, i.e., generally overlapping, spheres   (C 1754) 140  4/19  H &amp; S
 of organisation.  These have each given rise to difficulties which are familiar but completely different.  The results of an inefficient type of organisation were  brought out with peculiar clearness in the stress of the war.  The A.S.E. constitution,  which is  old, was found inadequate to  meet present demands upon it;  and accordingly the shop steward move- ment, which had already begun  previous to the war, at once assumed menacing propor- tions, standing as it did for one element which the A.S.E. constitution lacked, namely, local control over local affairs.  On the other  hand,  the more up-to-date and efficient types of constitution, such as those of  the miners and railwaymen, survived  the strain successfully.  In both bodies  there have been unofficial movements,  but they have been largely due to  differences of opinion upon policy and not to impatience with machinery, and in neither case have they been of sufficient importance to shake the constitutional structure.     The difficulties resulting from badly-defined  spheres  of control, of  course, centre mainly round the controversy between craft and industrial unionism.   They are as serious from the point of view of Labour itself as from that of the Government, involving as they do that heterogeneity of organisation which has been  the main stumbling block in the path of Labour.  From the purely Governmental point of view they involve difficulties in negotiation su JII as those already referred to in these  Reports in connection with the railway workshops.   These difficulties  are rendered  less  dangerous than  they might otherwise be by i he absence of bitterness resulting from the fact that Labour Leaders- at any  rate, the  aore level-headed of them recognise that the fault lies with Labour itself and not wit]. the Government.  In this connection the attitude recently of the Miners&apos; Federation in reJ ising to support any action by the N.TJ.R. on  behalf of  its members in the railway wo, k hops is noteworthy.     These  two d* fects of organisation, then, correspond to two tasks before Labour at the present time- -first, that of reforming the internal constitutions of many of its organisa- tions;  second,   iat  of delimiting  their sphere of activity so  as to achieve something like  co-ordinatio3 where at present there is chaos.  Of the two,  the first task is probably                 r.   The two main problems presented in this connection are first, the                 business in hand ;  and second, the representation of all craft interests                 jLical difficulty presented by the. first largely centres round the question                 .   The two main problems therefore may be summed up as the adequate representation o:: ocal and of craft interests respectively.  It will be clear that for a local Union covering   comparatively homogeneous sphere these problems do not arise in any- thing like so difl  alt a  form as in great organisations covering  the whole country and a wide range of o  ipations.                 national unions covering a large range of occupations they are of the                 o.  The  breakdown  of  the   A.S.E.  constitution  owing  to  want  of                 as already been referred to ;  and it may be noted that its constitution                 3thod of meeting the other problem since it makes no special provision                 3sts.  Its rules, however, are due to come up for  revision this year,                 interest to see  what advance is then made on  present arrangements.                 :i of Railwaymen, on the other hand, besides being a partially successful                  complete industrial union, was completely successful in solving  both                 of efficient internal organisation by an effective but complicated double                 i. local representation.  The Miners&apos; Federation of  Great Britain again                 de of an organisation  whose internal arrangements are sufficiently                  be noted,  however, that  efficiency  is obtained here by  introducing                  inciple,  and the Miners&apos; Federation * is almost unique in that it is a                 Unions but of  geographical districts, which themselves are, or rather                  lerations.   The only other example of methods of meeting this problem                  -ion which requires reference is the very important and peculiar one                  1 Trades Confederation; and since it is an example also of an extremely                  eet the other main  difficulty th&amp;t of overlapping and conflicting                  ay form a convenient bridge to the consideration of present affairs                  view.                 was created, in place of a loose organisation formed previously, the                 [ron  and Steel Confederation, which  covered  practically the  same                 federation,  but included also a new organisation called  the British                  ndred Trades Association (generally  known  as  &quot; Bisakta&quot;).  The                 E the new organisation are: (1) That none of the old societies are to                 rs; (2) that existing members of the old societies  may be transferredby far the simpquick despatch o-covered.

to the new society (Bisakta), and, consequently, (3) that within a few years the confederation-tion will become a confederation of only one Union, and will thus automatically become a  complete amalgamation.   This represents an ingenious experiment, because it  corn-prises a method of solving both of the main difficulties outlined above, while at the sametime  recognising and making provision for that conservatism that  exists among Trade,Unionists as elsewhere.   It solves the problem  of inefficient organisation by supersedingthe old Union machinery by the more efficient constitution of the new Bisakta, and it represents an attempt to solve the other problem to which we must now turn, by covering the Iron and Steel Trades with one efficient, all-embracing Union in the place of  a numberof unco-ordinated Unions as hitherto.    The difficulties created by overlapping and conflicting spheres of organisation maybe divided into two, according as they are historical in origin or are inherent in the natureof the situation.  Eoughly, it may be said that  the former are comparatively easy of solu-tion and are, as a matter of fact, being overcome, while the latter present an obstacle inthe removal  of which  very  little progress has been made, in  spite of  much  time and thought spent on it both by Labour itself and recently by the Ministry of Labour.    The path which has generally been followed in meeting difficulties of historical origin, ii.e., where a series of organisations have grown  up side by side, is what might  have been expected.  Competition is succeeded by partial co-operation expressing itself in working arrangements  and agreements  on certain  matters.   This  stage in turn is followed byfederation, which in general may be expected to result later in  complete amalgamation.Thus federation may be looked upon in general from this point of view as a sort of half-wayhouse towards amalgamation.  The two most important  cases where this is  probably nottrue are those of the Coal Mining and  Cotton Industries.   Coal mining has already been referred to, and the Cotton trade has always, from the point of view of organisation, stood in a class by itself, owing to its peculiar structure and high degree oi localisation.  other cases  where plans are being considered for amalgamation without the intervening stage of federation are shipbuilding, where boilermakers, shipwrights and blacksmiths are planningamalgamation ;  the woodworking trades,  where the carpenters and joiners have  amal-,gamated with the cabinet makers, and there is a plan for the amalgamation of the newsociety with  the Furnishing Trades Association;  among general labourers, where twoprojects  of amalgamation are  being  discussed ;  and, finally, the amalgamation of theco-operative and commercial employees with  the Warehousemen&apos;s Union  is  announced.this week.*    But though in this view federation is only in general a temporary measure, it repre-sents  the stage which has mainly been reached at the present time, and the present mayaccordingly be looked upon as the age of federations, which have been increasing in numberwith remarkable rapidity of late years. The beginning of 1918 saw the birth  of not less,than  7 important federations: The  National Federation of  General  Workers ;  TheIron and Steel Trades Confederation;  The National  Federation in the Foundry Trades;The  National Council  of Societies  representing Colliery Workers, other  than Miners;The Federation of Post  Office Unions;  The National  Association of Unions in the TextileTrades (Woollen); and the  National  Federation of Building Trade Operatives.    But,  even as  one reads this  list, which represents some achievement  in the way ofstraightening  out  overlapping  and unco-ordinated organisation, one cannot fail  to  be struck by the presence of the second more profound difficulty referred to above.  All this work  in the way of federation represents an attempt to combine those whose interests arecommon into  single  co-ordinated  organisations.  But  where the interests themselves are tangled it is impossible to represent them in any single line of organisations lying side,by side.   The  assumption has been  gaining ground recently that  the  most importantcommon interest that producers can have is interest in an industry as opposed to interestin craft, and the convenience of such an assumption from the  point of view  of certainclasses of social reformers has lent weight to its support.   Yet not only is it contradictedin fact by the existence of the great general labour unions and such organisations as that ofthe colliery workers other than miners, whose  very name seems to reflect the  bitternesswhich has existed between them and the Miners&apos; organisations, but in itself it providesno solution of the difficulty, because industries themselves are not entirely separate entities,.as the long line of conflicts over the railway workshops has been sufficient  to show.  so the problem remains of how  to obtain through a co-ordinated system representation fora great tangle of interests whose distribution is only very partially correlated  with the individuals covered by  them.   *  To complete the list it may be added that a number of important amalgamations have already takenplace in the past few years among general labourers, and that, at the end of 1915, the United Garment Workers&apos;Union was formed by the fusion of five Unions in the Clothing Trades.

                    fact  II.-DEMOBILISATION AND RESETTLEMENT. JTjg Administration of the Out-of-Worh Donation Scheme.      Criticism of the out-of-work donation scheme, where it is not based on an absolute objection  to any  non-contributory  scheme for maintenance during  unemployment, is generally directed against want of stringency in administration.   It  may,  therefore, be appropriate to indicate a few of the  administrative measures taken to  avoid abuse of the scheme, and, so far as possible, the measure of their efficacy.      The decision to withhold the donation rests in the first place with the employment exchange officials.  When this is done, there is a right of appeal in the first instance to a Court of Referees, sitting locally, and composed of an independent chairman, together with two  industrial  members.   The latter are taken  by rota from panels representing employers and workpeople respectively.  Originally, the Courts of Referees were concerned only with the administration of the Unemployment Insurance Acts.   In view of their extended work, the panels have  been reconstructed since the armistice, and the members have been  selected in  the main from nominees put forward by the  local Employment Committees connected with  the exchanges.*   Local knowledge is thus brought to  bear upon the cases requiring decision. From the decision of the Court of Referees there is a further appeal on behalf either of the Department or  of the applicant to the Umpire,&quot;]&quot; whose rulings constitute a body of precedents by  which both the exchange officials and the Courts  of Referees are guided in the administration of the scheme.     When the original period of 13  weeks for which the civilian donation is in the first place available has been completed, a further safeguard is brought into operation.  Appli- cations for  an extension of the period are decided by the local Employment Committees, and this fact, together with  the reduced scale on  which donation is payable, exercises a markedly deterrent effect  upon those with a weak case.  In only about 50 per cent, of the cases where civilian policies have expired has application been made for an extension of  the donation.  The sanction  of the local Employment  Committee, moreover, covers only the bare question  of extension.  It still remains for the exchange officials, the Court of  Referees, or the Umpire, to  decide, whether an applicant who  has been granted an extension of the donation satisfies the conditions necessary to draw it.     The belief appears prevalent in some quarters  that  many  persons in  receipt of donation have left their employment to take a holiday at  the State&apos;s  expense.  Among the million recipients of the donation there are no doubt some whose  unemployment is of  this kind.  It should be remembered, however, that where an applicant can be shown to  have left his employment voluntarily and without just cause, or to have lost his employ- ment through misconduct, he is disqualified  from receiving the donation for a period of  six weeks.  The  full application of this safeguard depends upon the  co-operation of the employers, to whom reference is made on these questions.  It cannot be  said that their response in this matter has been complete and effective.  Nevertheless, the provision is far from being  a dead letter.   The number  of appeal cases heard  by the Courts of Referees up to the 3rd April was a little over 90,000.  Of these claims for donation, about 71  per cent. Were disallowed.  Tn a little over 24 per cent, of the cases of rejection the applicant was held to have left his employment voluntarily and without due cause,  and in  nearly 10 per cent, to have been dismissed for unsatisfactory conduct.     The most frequent cause of withholding donation is refusal on the part of the applicant to  accept suitable employment  when offered.  It is obvious  that  the  question of suita- faility is one upon which  opinions may differ widely.  Much depends upon knowledge of  the applicant^ real capacity, and every effort has been made to provide the requisite information on this point.  It has been recognised that statements accepted by the ex- changes in the rush of the early days of the scheme were based in many cases solely upon war-time occupation, and did not provide a sufficient clue  as to the work for which the applicant was really suitable.  A complete re-registration of the applicants has therefore been carried out, in order to ascertain pre-war occupation.   At the same time, it has been recognised that labour, when possible, should be kept fluid, and that suitability of occupa- tion  cannot in many  cases  be  decided  by  blind adherence to  previous occupation. In  this connection several decisions of the Umpire are of interest.  Where several women workers were normally  employed, for example-, as worsted spinners or shop assistants, the action of the exchanges and of the Courts of Referees in withholding donation has  been    * The Divisional Councils and Local Advisory Committees, whose work was dealt with in this Report for the weekending the 9th April, 1919, are now known as Employment Councils and Employment Committees respectively.    t Many appeal cases, however, are determined at  headquarters in conformity with previous rulingswithout actual reference to the Umpire.
                           PART III.-PRESS COMMENTS.                           (1). Labour and Socialist Press.                    (A). The Peace Conference and Foreign Affairs.     The Labour Journals continue to carry on a wordy warfare among themselves aboutthe Peace Conference.   Controversy rages mainly round the conflicting policies at Pariswhich are usually fathered on France and America respectively, and the attitude towards them adopted by Mr. Lloyd George.  His statement in the House of Commons had notbeen made at the time of publication of the Labour weeklies, and there is much speculationon the subject during the second of the two weeks at present under review.  Referencesare also made to the Russian and Polish questions, the League of Nations and the Inter-national Labour Commission, the Indemnity and the Blockade.  Each of these will bedealt with separately.America, France and Mr. Lloyd George.     There is much indignation at  the  stand taken by M.  Clemenceau at Paris.  The&quot; Call&quot; says that he has assumed the mantle of the first Napoleon without any of thegreat Emperor&apos;s prescience  or imagination.  Even  the  &quot; Clarion,&quot;  although  holdingthat a League of Nations which fails to make France secure will be the merest futility,regards her  present claims as &quot;pregnant  with danger to the future  peace of Europe.&quot;The &quot; British Citizen &quot; upholds both the French and the Italian claims.  Mr. Hyndman,too, takes his stand (in  &quot; Justice &quot;) on the side of Fiance, and expresses the hope that ifthe English representatives in Paris desert her she will make a direct appeal to the EnglishDemocracy.  He points out how much deeper are the injuries which have  been inflicted on her than those suffered by the other Allies.   This is admitted even by those journalswhich dispute the justice of her claims.   Both the &quot; Clarion &quot; and the &quot; Call &quot; attributethe divergent aims of France and America to temperamental, historical and geographicaldifferences ;  the latter paper puts forward the interesting view that England and America,with  their  opportunities for  exploiting  German  colonies and undeveloped land as&quot;mandatories,&quot; and for supplying to the world the raw materials  of &quot;reconstruction,&quot;stand to gain enormously by a League of Nations, while France is too exhausted to under-take any great  enterprises until she has secured her economic position in Europe.  The&quot; Dreadnought &quot; too, alleges that while the war-aims of English and American  capitalists(as embodied in various secret treaties) have been  achieved, those of France and Italyhave not.  &quot; Forward &quot;  adds that  Clemenceau&apos;s France is  not the real France.  It isgenerally assumed that  Mr.  Lloyd George is throwing in his lot with America-perhap seven  going beyond her.  &quot; Justice &quot;  which, like the &quot; Clarion,&quot; is never weary of re-iterating that we are having &quot; too much Wilson &quot; at the Conference, attributes his attitude     (C1754)             &quot;                                                    B        confirmed when the applicants, after six or  eight weeks  of unemployment, refused toI        accept offers of employment in domestic service on the ground that they were entitled to        wait for work in their own occupation.  Again it has been laid down that when, after a        period  of  prolonged unemployment,  employment  for  a  worker  in   the  trade in        which he  or she  desires  to  engage is available only at a considerable distance, the        applicant must be prepared to move in order to accept this work, or else forfeit the donation.        This principle holds even though the standard rate of wages in the new district is lower        than in the district where the applicant is living.            That this test of  willingness  to accept  work is not applied loosely is shown  by        statistics of the work of the Courts of Referees.  In nearly 55 per cent, of the cases where        donation has been  refused  by the  courts, the  cause is  unwillingness  on the part of the        applicant to accept suitable employment.  Other causes for refusal of the  donation, such        as total incapacity  for work, or the fact that the applicant is still engaged in his normal        occupation,  although not fully employed, are  of less frequent occurrence.   The Employ-        ment Committees and Employment Councils in many cases are pressing for still greater        stringency.  Thus the  Women&apos;s Sub-Committee  of  the  Yorkshire and  East  Midlands        Employment Council, as a result of its investigations, has come to the conclusion that of        the women receiving donation in the division  about thirty per cent, who had no pre-war        occupation, are not dependent upon their own earnings for a livelihood, and has expressed        the belief that the donation will in these cases be withheld on the expiration of the first        period of donation.
,to (a) party opportunism which seems to be throwing him more and more into the arms of the I.L.P. Pacifists who were rejected at the General Election ; (6) belief that the economic strength of America makes her the safer party to support.  &quot; Forward &quot; rejoices that the Premiers election pledges are apparently becoming &quot; scraps of paper.&quot; The Indemnity.     This latter view is applied in particular to  Mr.  Lloyd George&apos;s disposition to corn- promise, as it is thought, on the question of the Indemnity to be exacted from Germany. &quot; He denounced a policy to get a majority,&quot;  says &quot; Forward &quot; &quot; he pursues it to get peace.&quot;   The  &quot; Call&quot;  declaims  against the economic mischievousness of indemnities. On the other side we find Lieut. S. Howard Withey indignantly maintaining, in &quot; Justice,&quot; that Germany can pay the Allied war costs to the full from the deposits of her coalfields. By rising these we could capture her export trade in coal, conserve our own resources, and reduce the miners&apos; hours without either diminishing their earnings or burdening the taxpayer.   The &quot; British Citizen,&quot; while doubting if the  &quot; uttermost farthing &quot; can be exacted,  plead for at any rate a large indemnity, which should be levied, it urges, in raw materials such as timber and potash capable of being worked up by British labour. Mr. A. M. Thompson,in the &quot; Clarion,&quot; insists that even if the indemnity cannot be paid, it ought to be  claimed as a matter of principle ;  while it remains as a  burden of debt on Germany, he adds, we have an excuse for preventing her from laying out any expenditure on armaments.  He draws attention, too, to  the mildness even  of the most stringent terms it is proposed to exact, when compared with, the severity of what Germany would have imposed in her hour of triumph. The Blockade.     It is interesting to note that &quot; Forward,&quot;  which usually ranges itself alongside the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot;  the protagonist of &quot; Raise the Blockade &quot; propagandism, now detects the cloven hoof of  Capitalism and Manchesterism in  the cry.  Better  far, it says, leave the work of future distribution in the hands of Mr. Hoover, who is getting well abreast of his task, than abandon it to the tender mercies of unregulated shipping which might easily be used for the conveyance of armaments.  Germane to the subject of the blockade is a piece of information commented on by the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; the  alleged statement of the German  Government to strikers in Ruhr  district, that the Allies  had forbidden the entry of food into any district where a strike was  in progress.  &quot; Is this the latest device for strike breaking ? &quot; asks the &quot; Leader.&quot; Russia.    The publication of the Governments &quot; White  Paper &quot; on Bolshevik atrocities, and thewidespread belief that two American citizens have returned from Russia with peace offersfrom  Lenin and a  first-hand repudiation of popular rumours  about the Soviet  Govern- ment, are discussed  in &quot; Forward,&quot; the &quot; Labour  Leader &quot; and the &quot; Call.&quot;  The &quot; Leader &quot;thinks America is favourable to the acceptance of- Lenin&apos;s  terms.  The &quot; White Paper &quot;is described as &quot;whitewash&quot; prompted not by moral indignation,  but by the  politicalnecessity  of working up a feeling to support military  action to which the Allies&apos;  ownblunders have  committed them.   The  &apos; Call&quot;  maintains that if it is possible  to sendreinforcements  into Russia it must be possible to get away the troops already there.  Mr.Ponsonby asserts in the &quot;Labour Leader&quot; that nothing but the sordid spirit of theUnancier is keeping  us in Russia. Poland.     &quot; Justice &quot; raises  a strong  protest  against the  apparent abandonment  of Dantzig to Germany.   Only forcible colonization, it maintains, has  made it possible for Germany to support her claims on grounds of nationality.  That the town should be placed in Polish hands is essential to the development of the Southern Slav nationalities by means  of the canalisation of the  Vistula.   The &quot; British Citizen &quot; takes  a similar line. League of Nations.     The &quot; Labour  Leader &quot;  criticises the resolutions  of the Trade Union Conference on the League of  Nations.  Many of its proposed  amendments to the Constitution are con- demned, and it is maintained that in any case  it would have been better to put forward a broad constructive policy instead of haggling over details.  The &quot; Leader &quot; itself, how- ever, in its ensuing issue, attacks certain features of the draft scheme as now published; in particular (a) the very limited authority of  the Board of Delegates; (b) the  decision
to make any admission of further States to the League contingent on  the  unanimousconsent of those originally forming it i.e., the Allies ;  and (c) the divesting of  the Leagueof any authority to limit armaments without the consent of the individual States.   Even ..the acceptance  of the amendments which have  gone  forth as the  voice  of organised labour would not satisfy the &quot; Call &quot; with the scheme for a League of Nations;  the only hope, it thinks,  lies in an organisation&quot; of international labour to hold the sword of Damoclesover governments which indulge in bellicose  aspirations.International Labour Convention.    After declaring that the body which it is proposed to set  up has been made impotent,thanks to the obstruction of American  opinion,  to do anything more than pass &quot; piousresolutions,&quot;  the  &quot; Labour Leader &quot; proceeds to discuss its  usefulness  in airing Labourgrievances, and adds that, if due weight be  given to Labour representation, it may help to secure an international minimum which will materially raise  the standards of backwardcountries  like Japan and India.  The  &quot;Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot; is very  bitter  aboutMx. Barnes&apos; complacence with  the scheme.  On the other hand,  the &quot; Clarion &quot;  insiststhat national economic advance is conditioned by the establishment of  internationalstandards,  and urges that traditional supporters of  a revolutionary International haveno grounds for withholding their blessing from a constitutional  International.Peace Prospects.    Mr. Ramsay  Macdonald communicates to the readers of &quot; Forward &quot; the  pessimisticconclusions he brought back from his visit to Paris, where he saw little but the &quot;  sordid;chicanery of demagogues.&quot;  But he sees a ray of light  in the summoning to Paris of  theGerman financiers not merely to register, but to discuss the financial terms a step which,though it may have  been due as much to  the  influence of international finance as ofpolitical wisdom, &quot; knocks  the  ground,&quot; he thinks,  &quot; from under the feet  of politicaljingoes,&quot; and makes it inevitable that the enemy representatives should  be allowed to  dis-cuss the peace  terms  as a whole.  He has hopes that the German democracy  may reject the&quot; sham League of Governments,&quot; and in any case he relies on the world forces now at.work to move  forward  despite the &quot; ants of Paris.&quot;   On  the whole,  &quot; Forward &quot; sees&quot; more room for hopefulness than for hysteria.&quot;   The &quot; British  Citizen &quot; is also optimistic..The &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; on the other hand, is gloomy.   &quot; No one,&quot; it says, &quot; now expectsa peace which will be accepted as final  or even temporarily  tolerable &quot;  by all  the parties concerned.  Mr. Ponsonby remarks that even  before  the Allies&apos; case  has been  settlednew wars are breaking  out, and he sees no hope at all if as seems likely PresidentWilson  withdraws from Paris.  He is very indignant, too, at the fact  that the terms ofthe treaty are to be kept secret till they are signed, especially as  the British  parliament has not the power, enjoyed by the representative assemblies  of France, America and evenItaly, of voting upon a peace treaty.  Mr. A. M. Thompson,  in  the &quot; Clarion,&quot; chides  thejournalists for their impatience, and points  out that problems so complicated cannot beunravelled in the time that it takes to  write a newspaper article.  The  same sentimentis echoed by  the &quot; British Citizen,&quot; but it thinks there would have been much less delayif the &quot; Big Four &quot; had taken in hand at once the really fundamental  problems, insteadof allowing incompetent commissions to fritter away time on minor issues.  The &quot; BradfordPioneer &quot; complains that the Balance of Power still looms in the foreground of the  visionof the Allies,  and instances our tenderness towards Turkey as an example of the continued.obsession of this relic of past diplomacy.    Bolshevism is discussed along the usual  lines ; the &quot; Call &quot; and the &quot; Dreadnought &quot;producing  first-hand evidence of the success of Soviet rule  in Russia,  and  the iniquitiesof our intervention,  while &quot; Justice &quot; gives comments of eye-witnesses  who have formedopposite conclusions.   The &quot; Dreadnought &quot; meets the argument  that the Soviet systemmay suit Slavonic peoples, but is foreign to the Teutonic and Anglo-Saxon genius, by pointing to its spread in Bavaria  and in Germany generally.  It  joins with the &quot; Call&quot;in expressing its disgust at the eagerness of  the Labour members,  in the recent debate onthe alleged Bolshevik overtures,  to disown all sympathy with the revolutionary  move-ments abroad, where the war of States is gradually merging into an international class-war..India.    Mr. Ramsay Macdonald draws attention in the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; to the  movementsfor &quot; Passive Resistance &quot; to the new  sedition  laws.   He has &quot; no love,&quot; he declares,&quot; for this sort of thing,&quot; but under the circumstances, he welcomes this &quot; open challenge &apos;rto laws which,  he avers, were opposed by &quot; every Indian whose opinion in any  way reflectspublic opinion.&quot;  He appeals to the I.L.P. to take a strong line in the matter.

 Egypt,     The same paper maintains that the revolts in Egypt have a  truly national basis, and unite all shades of religious belief.                                (B). Home Affairs. Industrial Conference.                                                    &apos;     There are a few belated comments on the Report issued by the Conference.  The Trade Union Appendix is praised by all the Labour papers except the &quot; Dreadnought,&quot; which thinks it &quot;by no means  a striking document&quot;;  &quot; Justice,&quot; however,  doubts whether it is really right in ascribing the existing unrest to a radical dissatisfaction with the structure of society.  Hours and wages, it fears, are still in the forefront of working- class aspirations, and the more revolutionary elements are hoping that, by lending support to  these more immediate aims, they  may  acheive their goal through the paralysis thus inflicted on industry.  The &quot; Clarion &quot; thinks the Appendix includes the &quot; really essential terms of Labour&apos;s Magna Charta,&quot; and &quot; Forward,&quot; while not expecting the concession-of  such  terms either by employers or by  a Government elected under a very different mandate, hopes the  force of events may hasten its application.  The &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; in an article  by the Secretary of the State Bonus League, develops the tentative references to  a State Bonus made in the Appendix, and strongly advocates that means of establish- ing a universal minimum standard of life.   With regard to the proposals of the  Report itself, the &quot; Call &quot; asserts that they leave the organised workers cold, but may do something to improve conditions in the backward and unorganised industries.   The &quot; Dreadnought&quot; complains that all the essential issues are shelved and left to the tender mercies of shadowy commissions.  The &quot; Clarion,&quot; although convinced that much more is needed, thinks these proposals will &quot;remove the main root  causes of poverty and degradation.&quot;  It pays a tribute to Mr. Smillie, declaring that his great victory for the miners has helped to bring the majority of employers into line with  the more enlightened minority, whose efforts at  amelioration have hitherto been crippled by competition.   It now remains, remarks xe Forward,&quot;  for  the Government to  apply the recommendation  of the Report.  The same paper takes the leaders of the Triple Alliance severely to task for their attitude of aloofness towards the Conference; urging the essential solidarity  of Labour, it  dilates on  the responsibility incurred by those who decline to lend a hand in what it believes will fee  a &quot; great  national opportunity.&quot; Labour Policy.     There is a general discussion in several of the  papers on the trend of Labour  policy. Dr. G. B. Clark, in &quot;Forward,&quot; and Sir  Leo Chiozza Money, in &quot;The Labour  Leader/&apos; both, deny the theory which seeks a remedy for the economic  situation in increased pro- duction  by the workers.  Most of them, says Sir Leo Money,  already work too hard, and increased productivity must be sought in better organisation and the elimination of economic parasites.   Dr.  Clark adds that  to  avert  the threat of  national bankruptcy we  should resort, not to measures which may cause a glut of goods, and will in any case only fill the pockets  of the creditor classes, but to an extension of the excess profits duty and a levy on capital.  The &quot; Labour  Leader &quot; gloomily sums up the economic situation in these words : &quot; What was national credit five years ago has now passed into the pockets of a nouieau  riche, and has become a national  burden.  Treasuries,  to keep people quiet, are pouring out wealth in doles and allowances; the working classes, after a few years offictitious prosperity,  are faced  with  permanently increased prices with  greater uncer- tainty in life.&quot;  But the new &quot; audacity &quot; of Labours demands, and the revolutionary movements in Europe, are  to  the &quot; Leader &quot;  signs of &quot; the dawn breaking through.&quot; Mr. John Bryan, in the &quot; Call,&quot; utters a strong plea for revolutionary socialism.  &quot; Jus- tice,&quot; as usual, has  some trenchant criticism  on Labour policy.   It maintains that the I.L.P. forfeited by its pacifist attitude in  1914 the position it might now have held in political life,  nd it criticises the &quot; Daily Herald &quot; as too much of a sectarian propagandist^ and too little of  a  newspaper not  even dealing fairly with certain sections  of  the Labour movement.  The  &quot;  British Citizen,&quot; too, blames the  quiescence of the Labour Party for the fact that Parliament, which does not give adequate attention to Labour problems, is  rapidly losing its hold on the community,  where they  are  all-absorbing. The &quot; Clarion &quot; points out how &quot;the  young man  from Ruskin &quot; is revolutionising  the Labour movement.     Coming  down to details of policy, &quot; Forward &quot; rejoices  at  the discomfiture  of  the &quot; Labour jingoes &quot; in the Triple Alliance dispute ;  while the  &quot; Dreadnought,&quot;  although deploring the necessity at the present moment for any weakening of industrial solidarity
18,9  by sectional action, maintains that the Miners&apos; Federation, if it impedes immediate action  by the rank and file, will have brought this disaster upon itself.  The political programme  of the Trade  Union Conference is  discussed by the  &quot; Clarion.&quot;  It refers ironically  to  Mr.  SmilhVs &quot; splendid  assurance &quot; in urging a general strike against conscription and  military  intervention, but refuses to take him quite seriously.  It points out that the  trend of by-elections and local elections indicates the early succession of a Labour Govem-  ment; Labour must therefore beware lest it then finds itself hoist with its own petard.  It draws attention,  too, to middle-class  organisations which may soon be able to hold  up society as effectively as  the Triple Alliance itself.  On the other  hand, Mr. Philip  Snowden in the &quot; Labour Leader &quot;  argues that Labour should lose no time in  conferring  on ways  and means of compelling the Government to withdraw from Russia.   Replying  to arguments  against the political strike  brought forward by Mr.  Clynes and others, the  &quot; Leader &quot; urges that such action is fully  justified when a Government continues in power  after national confidence, won by pledges which were impossible of fulfilment, has been  withdrawn from it;  for ordinary constitutional procedure would prolong its life long after  its representative character had been lost,  and enable it to do infinite mischief.  Unemployment.       &quot; Justice  &quot; lays the blame for the widespread unemployment on the fact that the  Government threw  aside, in response to  the demand  for rapid demobilisation, a scheme  which might  at  least  have  mitigated unemployment among  demobilised  soldiers.   If  the Government does not get  ahead  at once, it says, with development schemes housing,  roads, and above all food production we shall  only escape bankruptcy by becoming  beholden to the U.S.A.  Conscription.      In the &quot; Call,&quot; the &quot; Dreadnought &quot; and especially the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; there is  gL&apos;eat jubilation at the release of all  conscientious objectors who have spent two&apos; years  and upwards in prison.  But the &quot; Call&quot;  says &quot; Release  them all! &quot;  The continuance  of  conscription is bitterly attacked  in the &quot; Call&quot; and the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; the latter  seeing in it the abandonment of another  Government  pledge, the former describing it  as  a shield against revolution for the behoof of the  &quot; gang of profiteers who  run the British  Empire for their private profit.&quot;  Housing.      The  &quot;  Labour Leader &quot;  publishes an  interview  with  the  Secretary  of the Labour  Housing Association in which criticisms are passed upon the Government Housing Scheme.&apos;  The Government is evidently doing  its utmost, he asserts, to undermine municipal enter-  prise and  the  development of  productive co-operation by the &quot; wicked &quot; proposal of  making the subsidisation of public utility societies an  alternative to municipal  enterprise,  a loophole of which full advantage will doubtless be taken by reactionary local authorities.  Workmen  are  warned  against accepting delusive facilities for the purchase of houses  which in a  few years will become out-of-date and be  left on their hands.  The &quot; British  Citizen&quot;  criticises the  Bill from  a somewhat different angle.  While the  measure is  admitted to be broader than most of its predecessors, it is not considered to be sufficiently  drastic in its hold upon  local authorities; housing should be on a national  basis, and  national factories used for the purpose.  Moreover,  the problem of the Dublin slums  remains unsolved.  The &quot; Call &quot; indulges  in sarcasm at the expense  of the recent interest  of Royalty in  the slums, and thinks this solicitude may owe something to the growing  insecurity  of thrones.  Government Control.      t     Mr. Joe Terrett, writing in &quot; Justice &quot; on the &quot; Economics of Control,&quot;  points out  how almost every controlled article has gone up in price ; and he urges that war control .  almost a realisation of the socialist  dreams of  Proudhon and Rodbertus-illustrates how  the Utopias of early socialism lend themselves in practice to capitalist exploitation, since  the fixing  of  price  by the least efficient concern inevitably means huge  profits for the  better favoured businesses.   &quot; Forward &quot; is aggrieved  at  the  fact that  socialisation is.  always applied to the worst paying industries.   To profitable concerns some  sort of-  Government control is applied, and  the resulting blunders are pointed out as refutations:  of  socialism.
Transport Bill.    &quot; Forward &quot;  draws attention to an admission by Sir Eric Geddes in the House ofCommons that up to the armistice  there was no deficit in the running of railways, thefigures previously given having been only an estimate of what might be the loss at the endof a year as a result of a decline in  Government  traffic.  Now that the  lailwaymen havebeen pacified, it  remarks, the statement on  which  the  rejection  of their demands was based  can  safely  be repudiated !Political Situation.    There  is general rejoicing at the results of recent by-elections and local elections;though many of the papers express  a dread that  the inertia of Labour organisation mayenable the Liberal Party to re-constitute itself-perhaps under the leadership of Mr. LloydGeorge and reap the fruits of discontent with the Coalition Government.  The &quot; Workers&apos;Dreadnought&quot; sees a dangerous prospect of growing irresponsibility on the  part  of theWar Cabinet, especially in view of the continued membership of Dominion representatives who cannot  possibly be called to account by the  British Parliament.  The  &quot; labour leader &quot; thinks that political prejudice was  responsible for the decision in  the Le Bastrial.               (2). The Daily Press on Demobilisation and Resettlement.Demonstration at Bristol.    The &quot; Western Daily Press &quot; (14th April) reports that hundreds of ex-soldiers marchedthrough  Bristol on the 12th April protesting against their unemployment and urging the abolition of the female labour which has taken the place of male labour since 1914.Unemployment Donation.    The  &quot;Daily Herald&quot; (16th  April) reports that the Newcastle rhembers of theAmalgamated Society of Engineers have passed a resolution calling for a revision of theconditions of payment  of out-of-work  benefit.  They demand that no  donation shallbe stopped &quot; in cases where it is proved that acceptance of employment away from homewill give rise to inconvenience, domestic and financial, involving maintenance of lodgings .and support of home dependents.&quot;                                     PART IV.

The result of the ballot was announced at  the meeting of the Miners&apos; Federation,which was held at Southport on the 16th April.  The figures were 693,084 in favour of acceptance and 76,992 against.  During the  afternoon  session  a  resolution was passeddemanding the abandonment of the  Military  Service Bill and the withdrawal of troops from Russia.  This resolution was submitted  to the Triple Alliance at a meeting whichwas held on the same evening at Southport.Coal  Commission.    The Commission resumed its public sessions on the 23rd April, and proceeded to take evidence on the question of Nationalisation of  Mines. Triple Alliance.    At the  meeting held in Southport  on the evening of the 16th April, the above-men-tioned resolution was considered and a motion was passed calling upon the parliamentary committee of the Trades Union Congress to convene a special national conference of theTrade Union movement in order to decide what action, if any, should be taken to compel the Government to  comply with the terms.of the resolution.
Labour Party and Trades  Union Congress.     A joint meeting of the Labour Party Executive and the Parliamentary Committeeof the Trades Union Congress was held on the 19th April.  It was decided to send a depu-tation to the Prime Minister or  Mr. Bonar Law to discuss the following  questions: Conscription, the blockade of enemy countries, Russia,  the treatment of conscientious objectors.Electrical Trades Union.     A serious dispute has arisen between electrical contractors in London and the E.T.U.on the question of  the employment of non-union labour. The workers threaten to cutoff the light from firms which allow non-union employees to work on their premises.   Theemployers have replied with a lock-out threat, on the grounds that the action of the menis contrary to the rules agreed to between the masters and men in 1914 and 1915.   (see part V.)Agricultural  Labourers.    A Conference was held on the 11th April  between  representatives of  the Agricul-tural branches of the Workers&apos; Union and members of the Country Wages Committee.The Conference  decided  to accept the  proposals of the Wages  Board to advance wages6s. Qd.  a week.  Farmers in all parts of the country are protesting  against the recom-mendation of  the Agricultural Wages Board.    A Conference  of  the National  Agricultural Labourers and Rural Workers&apos; union was held at the Memorial Hall on Saturday, the 12th April.   A resolution was passedaccepting the  settlement reached by the Agricultural Wages Board, but declaring thatthe minimum wages fixed are still inadequate, and instructing the Executive Committeeto press for a national minimum of 50s.  for a week of 44 hours all the year round.   Theresolution also condemned the &quot; tied-cottage &quot;  system and urged  the  Government toproceed immediately with the national housing  scheme.  Other resolutions  were passed in favour of a Government inquiry into the question of land nationalisation, the increaseof old-age pensions, and  provision for widows and orphans.Bakers.    The Executive  Committee of the Amalgamated Union of  Operative Bakers held  ameeting at Chelsea  recently and passed a resolution,  which  may be summarised asfollows:     (1) The Executive Council regard the offer of the master bakers to discuss the situa-          tion after the  12-hour order is revoked as most vague and unsatisfactory  and          as binding the employers to nothing.    (2) It affirms therefore, that nothing short of the acceptance of  the principle of  the          abolition of night work is any solution of the question.    (3) It calls upon  the Government to forbid night work by a temporary  Order in          Council pending legislation as recommended by the General Purposes  Com-          mittee of the Joint Industrial Council.    (4) Failing such a settlement by the Government, a national strike will be declared          if  any attempt to return to night baking is made by any section of the  em-          ployers.                                                              &apos;    The Executive  demanded a Government inquiry into the conditions of  the industrythroughout the country;Night-baking Inquiry.    The Minister of Labour  has appointed the following to be a Committee  to inquire into the question of night baking :         Sir William Mackenzie, K.C. (Chairman).        Mr. R. E. Graves, Deputy Chief Inspector of Factories.        Mr. Webster Jenkinson.        Mr. J. J. Jones, M.P.        Major E. F. L. Wood, M.P.    The terms of reference are: &quot; To inquire into the practice of night baking in  the bread-baking and flour confectionery trade, and to report whether it is desirable in  theinterests of those engaged in the trade and of the community that the practice should be abolished or modified.&quot;
 National Federation of General Workers.     A Conference of the National Federation of  General Workers was held at Caxton Hall on the 16th April.   It was decided that the Minister of Labour should be approached with a view to a representative conference on a 44-hour week for all municipal workers. Other questions discussed were the hours of labour in gas works and chemical works and the periodical revision of wages in certain trades, and it was decided, that the Federation should concentrate upon action with a view to securing that all increases in wages during the war should be consolidated into a permanent advance of wages. Cotton Operatives.     The negotiations between employers and employees in the cotton trade were resumed on the 16th April.  The employers offered to reduce the hours to 48, but asked for a modi- fication of the operatives&apos; claim for no alteration of wages.  The meeting was adjourned until the 24th April to enable the operatives to prepare their reply. Asylum Workers.     The National Asylum Workers&apos; Union is again at a deadlock with the Asylum autho- rities on the wages question, while the differences as to hours are  still unsettled, with a ballot proceeding.  The  authorities have offered a 60-hour week, but it is expected that the Union will remain firm in its demand for 48 hours.   Hours and wages will be considered together at an adjourned meeting of the Joint Committee in London on the 30th April. Yorkshire Building Trade.     A Yorkshire Joint Council for the building industry was set up in Leeds on the 10th April, as the result of a conference between employers&apos; representatives and the Yorkshire District Council of the  National Federation of Building Trade  Operatives.     The conference, after a long sitting, agreed upon a 46^-hours&apos; week for ten months in... the year and a 41f-hours&apos; week during the remaining two months, at similar rates of wages. This gives an average working week of 45f- hours, but in the event of a 44-hours&apos; week being  awarded (application has already been made for this)  there will be an adjustment of wages.     Standard rates of wages (all bonuses merged) have also been  agreed upon.     These decisions,  which affect between sixty and seventy thousand operatives, will&apos;Come into operation on the 1st May. Amalgamation of Trade Unions.     At the 27th annual delegate meeting of the Amalgamated Union of Co-operative and Commercial Employees,  which was held in Leeds on the 21st April, it was announced by the General Secretary, Mr. J.  Hallsworth of Manchester, that  it has been definitely decided to amalgamate with the National Warehouse and General Workers&apos; Union and that a scheme was now in process of formation.   He also stated that  negotiations were in progress with the Shop Assistants&apos; Union for the purpose of amalgamation.     It was announced at the resumed annual meeting of  the Shop Assistants on the 21st April that amalgamation with the Co-operative Employees&apos; Union had been carried  by46 to 15 votes.Garment Workers.     At a conference in Leeds on the 21st April of delegates of the United Garment Workers Trade Union, representative of 100,000 workers, it was stated that the national programmeincluded a 44 hours&apos; week, the restriction of overtime to six hours a week and the abolition of fines.     The conference also agreed to demand a Is. per hour minimum for all female  workers and a 2s. per hour minimum for all male  workers ; female cutters, pressers, passers and fitters to be entitled to equal rates for equal work  with male workers in these categories. The rates to be demanded for these sections for both.men and women is 2s. Id. per hour. It was decided that piece-rates should yield 33f per cent, over and above time rates andthat the rates should apply to all men and women over 18 years of age.  The question ofworkers under 18 was left in the hands of the executive to arrange with  the employersafter the adult rate is definitely fixed.
 Joint Industrial Councils.     Local Authorities Non-Trading Services. The first meeting of the Council for Local Authorities Non-Trading Services was held on the  11th  of April.   The Constitution of the Council was adopted, and an Executive Committee, consisting of six members from each side of the Council was elected.    Furniture.-At the 12th Meeting of  Council,&apos;held on the 8th April, notification was received of the resignation from the Council of the Scottish  Furniture  Manufacturers Association.   This action has arisen out of the refusal of the Council to accept the scheme submitted by the S.F.M.A.  for a District Council in Scotland.    Electricity-Tlie Draft Constitution has been approved by the constituent associations.    Zinc and Spelter. A Draft Constitution has been approved by both sides and applica- tion has been made to the Ministry of Labour for recognition. Trade Boards.    Lace Finishing Trade. The Lace Finishing Trade Board have varied  certain of the existing general minimum piece rates.    They have  also requested the Department to submit a memorandum on the  State Regulation of Wages  in the Lace Finishing Trade Abroad to the Labour  Section of the Peace Conference.    Tobacco  Trade. Regulations constituting the Trade Board have been made and preliminary notices have been issued intimating that the first meeting of the Board will be  held  on the 29th April.    Aerated Waters Trade. It has been decided to establish a separate Trade  Board forthe Aerated Waters Trade in Scotland.    Draft Special Orders. Statutory  notice has  been given of  the Minister&apos;s intentionto apply the  Trade Boards  Acts to the  following trades:          (1) Jute Trade.         (2) Flax and Hemp Trade.         (3) Jute, Flax and  Hemp Finishing.                               (2) District Reports.  London and South-Eastern.      In the metropolitan area, there are sporadic signs of an industrial revival.  Building &apos; operations in Oxford Street, road repairs in Kent, and extensions to industrial establish-  ments at Maidstone should help to provide employment.  Building schemes are said to be delayed by a shortage of bricks, the retention of pivotal men in the Army, the difficulty  of getting adequate deliveries of timber, and the high costs of working and material.  Ilford Local  Employment Committee suggests the erection of Government establishments  on the lines of Woolwich Arsenal to create employment under non-competitive conditions &apos; for disabled ex-service men near their homes.     The question of an adequate system of classification of applicants for work has been discussed by the Employment Council, and the Women&apos;s Sub-Committee is taking steps to co-operate with the three Women&apos;s Services in the resettlement of unemployed women. &apos; South Midlands and Eastern.     Unemployment in this area is not regarded as serious.  There are local fluctuations only, and no serious increase is anticipated.  The  centres of unemployment are isolated industrial centres, such  as Cambridge,  Norwich, Ipswich,  Southend,  Watford,  Luton, Leicester, Oxford and Reading.  At  Grays, practically  all girls have been  cleared  off. the  register and the Local Training Centre will close shortly.     The  Department has  conducted housing investigations at Oxford and Banbury. State settlements  and workshops for  the disabled are proposed at Cambridge.  Lowestoft Women&apos;s Sub-Committee is launching a  &quot; Legion of Household Orderlies.&quot;  Reading Council is arranging  for training  in  domestic science in co-operation  with  the  Local Education Authority.  Building schemes at Ipswich and harbour improvements at  Great Yarmouth are under consideration.
South-Western.    There is little to report from this area.  From engineering works at Exeter there is.a complaint that, while raw material is now being obtained in sufficient quantity, thereis a shortage of skilled workers.  Discharges from Government establishments are affectingthe unemployment figures from Woolston, Devonport and Barnstaple.  From Southamptonit is reported that there seems still to be plenty of employment with local  shipbuildingfirms, although it is stated unofficially that the Admiralty have cancelled many of their contracts.  This cancellation of Admiralty contracts is said to be particularly affectingthe Isle of Wight;  schemes of public works are being discussed to meet the peculiar labour situation in the island.West  Midlands.    A gradual increase of industrial discontent in this area is attributed to unemployment,,petty trade disputes, and the vigorous campaign of the younger trade unionists.  though there is a slight decrease in unemployment among women and  juveniles, the rate is stillhigh compared with the  national average.  Engineering, building and road transport are the trades  most affected by the change over to peace conditions, which has beenabnormally difficult in this area owing to its concentration on war-production.   The releaseof pivotal men from the army is easing the situation and should be hastened.   Industrialslackness  is disappearing under the stimulus of American and Japanese competition.    The Department has prepared reports on the non-ferrous metals industries, and onthe industrial situation at Wolverhampton,  where there  is a shortage  of the necessaryround iron and coal.North-Western.    The industrial situation is described as &quot; extremely grave,&quot; owing to the unemploymentin the textile industry.    The textile engineering industry at Oldham and other centres is reported to be slackowing to the retention of pivotal plate moulders in the Army.    A conference has been held with local trade union representatives on the subject of the resettlement  of disabled men.  It is suggested that a general conference should be held between employers&apos; federations and trade unions to discuss the conditions of employmentof disabled men and the modification of existing rules which  may be  necessary.  It isurged that the Government should set an example by the settlement of disabled men insuch departments as the Post Office.    There is a  demand for an increased staff in this area to cope with the work of theindustrial survey which is  so essential to resettlement.Yorkshire and East Midlands.    A special  investigation  was  undertaken  into the  increase of  unemployment  atGrimsby.  Extensive building schemes are on hand, and  a dock extension contemplated by the Great Central  Railway in  1914 is again being considered.    The number of unemployed women is a feature of the returns from Derby (wherethe hosiery and lace trade is depressed), Nottingham, Sheffield and Leeds. ^ The women&apos;s Sub-committee is  taking up the  questions of domestic  service  and municipal laundries,and recommends  that women drawing out-of-work donation should  be permitted  to undergo  training  in factories under approved schemes without being disqualified from continuing to draw the difference between their wages as learners and the full donation.In Yorkshire the  depressed condition of the cotton trade acutely affects only the Tod-morden area, where the mills have closed down for a fortnight.Northern.    Decreases  of  unemployment  are  reported  from-, Newcastle and  Gateshead, and increases at the iron centres, Middlesbrough, Stockton and Hartlepool.   Engineering and paper-making are the  trades most affected, but the situation in  engineering is expectedto improve shortly when Sir W.  G. Armstrong, Whitworth &amp; Co., Ltd., have completed their  re-organisation  for  peace  production.  Housing schemes  will give  employmentshortly  at Stockton and South Shields and at Newcastle, where the  Garden Cities and town Planning Association has been conducting propaganda work.   The  department has investigated housing  conditions and prospects at  Carlisle and in the  Cumberlandcoal towns.   It is also inquiring into the unemployment in paper-making, binder twinemaking,  millinery and dressmaking.
     The resettlement of disabled soldiers is being considered.  The proposal to re-open Newsham Pottery Works as a training centre for the disabled is receiving special attention; meanwhile a press campaign and the canvassing of individual employers have produced considerable results.     Labour  is generally disturbed by a  growing agitation for a  44-hour  week.  This has been granted by the Co-operative Wholesale Society to the employees in their soap, jam, margarine,  lard and printing works, anddn their packing factories and flour  mills. In the iron towns there is a tendency to  refuse to work overtime or week-ends until the 44-hour  week is  secured.     In the ports demarcation disputes are frequent between fitters and plumbers, and between joiners and shipwrights.  On Tees-side the question of Sunday work, which had been stopped owing to  the  withdrawal of Sunday trams, has been temporarily settled by the Department intervening to secure a limited motor-bus service.                                                              * Wales.     Unemployment is not now showing any  very serious increase  except in such areas as Monmouth and Flint.  The tinplate industry is slack  owing to a shortage  of steel bars due to very limited supplies of raw materials, but in Llanelly the plate mills are becoming busier.   In Merthyr unemployment is rapidly decreasing. The Ebbw Vale  Steel Works have continued working, as supplies of iron ore and coal have arrived, and efforts are being made to prevent the Cyfarthfa Iron Works from closing. ,    Fjmployment schemes include road-making  at Cardiff, a toy factory at Pembroke,and an extensive housing scheme at Swansea.  Bargoed Local Employment Committeereports on the difficulty of  providing disabled miners with an alternative occupation in a purely mining  area.  Schemes for market gardening, basket-making  and boot-making are all criticised as not being such as can locally absorb the men after training.     The Department is investigating the  steel sheet trade.   In the tinplate industryrank and file agitation  over  a wages dispute is threatening to wreck the recently-estab-lished  Industrial  Council.  In the iron and steel industry the  temper of labour is very uncertain; it is demanding  a revision of the  South Wales and  Monmouth sliding  scaleagreement.  The question of American competition has become prominent;  the UnitedStates Consolidated Steel Corporation has circularised the area, soliciting inquiries andpromising prompt deliveries and reasonable and stable  prices.     At the ports the agitation against coloured  labour on ships continues.Scotland.     The textile towns on the East Coast are  still suffering from depression.  Dundee is most seriously affected, but acute unemployment is spreading to Kirkcaldy and Dunferm-line.  An attempt is being made to engage the unemployed women in  these centres to meetthe demand for women,workers in hosiery and woollen trades at Galashiels and  otherBorder towns.  Kirkcaldy is pushing forward  extensive foreshore  reclamation works.The dumping  of  Scandinavian, Dutch and American supplies is alleged as the cause ofunemployment at such paper-making centres as Airdrie,  Johnstone and Falkirk.     The  Council is  preparing a  national survey of the housing question, and the supplyof housing material is to be investigated by area officers.   A training scheme for domestic service is being started in Edinburgh in connection with the Edinburgh School of Cookeryand Domestic  Service ;  and the position of apprentices in various trades is being investi-gated.                                 PART  V. DISPUTES... (a) Involving a Stoppage of Work.           A strike affecting 5,000 men at Liverpool Docks began on the 22nd April, when a dispute        arose over a clause in the new Dockers Charter which was put into operation that morning.        This clause stipulates that men who commence work at 8 a.m. shall present themselves at the        stands at 7.45.  The  majority of dockers did not arrive until a few minutes before 8 a.m.,        and the foremen refused to engage them, alleging that they had broken the agreement.           On the 22nd April, a strike of 2,000 officials and men occurred at the Britannia P.D.        Colliery, Pengam, South Wales, owing to the dismissal of a mechanic ;  the men allege that he        was dismissed because he joined the officials&apos; Union, the Company denies this, stating that there&apos;        are other reasons.  Among the men  on strike are members of three Unions, the Officials&apos;,        the Firemen&apos;s, and the Miners&apos; Federation.
            The proclamation of Limerick as a military area led to the closing of all shops and works        on the 14th April.  The President of the Limerick Trades Council declared that the organised        workers will refuse to ask the military for permits, the strike being a protest against the action        of the authorities.                                         ,            The unofficial strike of painters for increased wages from Is. M, to Is. 8d, has spread to        several more firms in London.            Two thousand tailors and tailoresses employed  in the wholesale trade  at Huddersfield        struck on the 9th April, for an increase of .1s. 6d. per hour for men, and lO^d. per hour for women ; -        they rejected the employers&apos; offer.  No report of a settlement has yet been received.            The farm labourers&apos; boycott of farmers who refuse to concede their demand  for a 5s. a        week increase is still in  progress at Maghull (Lancashire) Melling and Lydiate.            Municipal employees at South Shields, Perth and Bolton struck work in support of various        demands for better working conditions.  An agreement has been reached at Perth.  At Bolton;        the action of the  strikers was condemned by a joint meeting of the employers, and the men&apos;s        Union representatives.(6) Not involving a Stoppage of Work.            During the week a dispute arose concerning the payment of a  3 war risks bonus, granted        to practically  all wireless operatives  by  the Shipping Controller on the 14th March.   The        Shipping Federation claimed that the bonus should be paid, not by them, but by the Marconi        Company;   in the meantime  no payments  were made to  the operatives.   The  threatened        strike in consequence  of this delay  has been  averted and payment is to be made by the        Marconi Company.            The  electricians employed at Rashleigh, Phipps &amp;  Co., Oxford Street, have been on strike        since the beginning of the year because non-union labour was employed. The Masters&apos; Associa-        tion considers that this embargo is contrary to the &quot; London Working Rules &quot; agreed upon in        1914 and 1915 which provided that no exception shall be taken to the employment of any man        on the ground that he is not a member of any organised trade society.  On the Masters&apos;  side        it is stated that the workers have given no notice to abrogate the agreement;  on  the other,        Mr. &quot;Webb, Secretary of the London Branch of the E.T.U., declared that he has repudiated this-        clause on innumerable occasions.  The employers threaten a general lock-out unless the embargo        is removed.  At a meeting of the London members of the E.T.U.,  on the 16th April, it  was        unanimously decided not to lift the embargo, but to face the consequences of a general lock-out.            Some 800 City of London street cleaners threaten to strike on the 21st April, because they        have not been conceded the award of the Conciliation Board of a bonus of 24s. per week,  plus        20 per cent, increase on pre-war wages.  The City Corporation pleads that  it has only  just        received the award and must have time to consider it.            The farmers in some parts of West Riding threaten to strike unless the Government gives        them better  prices for their produce to enable them to meet the demand for increased wages.        In Warwickshire the farmers have pledged themselves  to refuse to accept the decisions of the        Central Wages Board until a more equitable policy with regard to the proposed agricultural        wages advance of 6s. 6d. is established.           The South Wales Colliery Clerks, on the 21st April, decided to call a general strike unless        within ten days the coalowners agreed to set up a Joint Wages Board, and to consider their        demands for higher wages.           It is  stated that a return to night work in any part of the country will lead to a national        strike of bakers.
