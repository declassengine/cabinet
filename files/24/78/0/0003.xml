I circulate this Memorandum which&apos;has been prepared in the General Staff.                                              WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.12th April, 1919.    It has become quite evident from the experience gained since the Armistice thatthe inclusion of officers and &quot;non-commissioned officers for educational purposes withinthe normal  war establishment  is  most unsatisfactory.   Both military training  and education suffer.  If the Armies of Occupation are to be efficient militarily the officersand non-commissioned  officers  must not only know their drill,  military duties,  &amp;c, butalso know their men from a military point of view so as to be able to lead  them inaction.  If educational training is to be efficient, instructors must be chosen for educa-tional qualifications and given time to prepare their courses.  No one can drill a platoonone hour,  take orderly officers duties another, and be  an instructor in history, say, a third, with any  satisfaction  to  himself or his men.   It is a sine qua non of an armythat it must be efficient militarily; it  is obvious  that if educational training is to becarried out it must be allowed qualified instructors.  Further, a large  number of officersand non-commissioned officers have agreed to remain on in. the Armies of Occupation onthe explicit understanding that they were to be  employed on education.  These- are unwilling  to continue  as  company  and  platoon  commanders and  non-commissioneclofficers, and it would be a breach of faith now to compel  them to.  If, therefore, the educational  personnel  is to  be included in the normal war establishment  it will meaneither that  a  great many officers  and non-commissioned officers will  be forced, against their  will and contrary to  their  understanding when they  waived their  claims todemobilization, to undertake military duties;  or, if they are released, that educationwill be carried on by  officers and  non-commissioned officers neither desirous of takingclasses nor qualified to do so.    The first alternative suggested by the Treasury, namely, that educational personnelshould be assigned a share in the ordinary military duties of the unit, means giving aninstructor who is retained on  educational grounds work of a wholly different  kind.which he is unwilling to do, and for which he will have no time to prepare himself if heis  satisfactorily to perform the duty for which he is primarily retained.  The second alternative, that the remaining officers and non-commissioned officers should  perform the military duties and so free the educational personnel, means depriving  each unit ofa certain number of combatant officers and non-commissioned officers, and renderingeach unit by so much the  less ready to  take the field.   Not only that, it would throwupon the remaining officers and non-commissioned officers an additional burden  of drills,guards, &amp;c, and cause the greatest discontent generally throughout the armies.    Secondly, if officers and non-commissioned officers for educational purposes  are within the  normal  war establishment of units, it will be infinitely more difficult  to distribute instructors according  to the requirements and to the supply than if there isan educational establishment  allowing officers and non-commissioned officers to beattached to units as required.  For efficiency it is in every way preferable to have aneducational corps, the members of which can be allocated as necessary;  otherwise everyunit must to a great extent rely upon the resources it may chance to  possess.    Further, it  is regarded as absolutely essential  that the educational personnel retain the pay  they are receiving at present.  Extra-duty  pay  to the educational personnelwas sanctioned  by Army Order  XVIII. of 20th December,  1918 ; they have been receiving  it ever since  that date, and many have agreed to  take up educational work inthe Armies of Occupation because of this inducement.   Under that Army order they    (B19/191) 70  4/19 II&amp;S 7047vo
were promised its continuance, and not only will educational training become practically impossible if that inducement is withdrawn, but it will be difficult honourably to defendits withdrawal.  It is, in brief, abundantly clear from the evidence that the educationalpersonnel will labour under a  very serious grievance if (1) they are now asked to take up military  duties additional to their educational work; or (2) if they are now informed .that their pay must be reduced.  The Secretary of State  has stated in Parliament thateducational  work will be  continued, and as  far as possible extended in the Armies ofOccupation.; and - it -is, the. unanimous opinion - of General Officers Commanding-in-Chiefthat it cannot be stopped or cut down without a most detrimental effect on morale; itis obvious also the more that can be done for the men whilst they are retained the more economical  it will be to the nation in the future.  It should also be pointed out thatthe estimated figure of %B75,0007. is an absolute maximum if all the establishments arefilled ;  at the present time educational personnel are not-nearly up to establishment, andit is very improbable  that  sufficient instructors will ever be found to fill  it.   Finally,evidence  accumulates that  great uneasiness is being  caused  by  the&apos;inability to issueauthorization; and instructions, *  It is of the very highest importance that authorizationshould be obtained and made known without further delay ; the armies are pressing for it, and the whole future of educational training is being jeopardized by the uncertainty of staffs and instructors as to their position and pay.
