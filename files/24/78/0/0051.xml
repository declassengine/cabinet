M.C. 755;Ministry of Munitions of War,     Whitehall Place,         London, S.W. .             2^th April, 1919.Sir       I an directed by the Minister&apos; of Munitions to request you to -circulate the Reports of the Committee of Enquiry into theRoyal Ordnance Factories&apos;..,Woolwich, which was &quot;appointed by Mr.Churchill in July, 1918, under the Chairmanship of the right on. T. McKinnon Wood.       The majority of the recommendations- of the Committee dealwith questions of general administration upon which action isbeing taken.   They include, however, certain points cf policywhich call for either the confirmation or a decision of the WarCabinet, viz:-       That the arguments in favour of the retention of a        Government-Arsenal for munition manufacture in        peace time are overwhelming, and that the location        of that Government Arsenal should be at Woolwich.       That Woolwich Arsenal should be organised mainly as        a peace establishment for the supply of Armaments        in peace  time and of experimental types and improved        design in War and Peace;  and that its reserve of        expansion, so far as its peace lay-out is concrnrd,        be limited to increased production in the case of        small wars.       That one Minister only should be solely responsible        for the Control of the Arsenal.       It will be observed that the Committee! are strongly infavour of the retention of a Government Arsenal on a restrictedsoale at Woolwich and if this decision be. approved by theCabinet it will fall to the Minister of Supply to organise theestablishment accordingly,                         I am Sir,                           Your obedient Servant,                            ..

isFINAL KEPOKT.THE RIOHT HON.  LORD  INVERFORTH OF SOUTHS ATE,             MINISTER OF MUNITIONS.YOUR  LORDSHIP,    The Committee of  Enquiry into the Royal  Ordnance  Factories,  Woolwich, appointed by  yourpredecessor, present their Third Report, in which they deal specifically with the question of the systemof costs in operation at the Ordnance  Factories.                        ,    TheCommittee have covered in their three Reports all the aspects of the Enquiry suggested by theirwide terms of reference which it appears to them they can usefully consider.   Other questions, such asthose affecting specific conditions of employment at Woolwich, were brought before them during the courseof their Enquiry ; but the Committee feel  that such questions must be considered departmentally in thelight of their possible effect upon establishments other than Woolwich, and in conformity with theGovernment^ future policy as regards National Factories generally.    The Committee cannot emphasise too  strongly  the importance which  they attach to the re-organisation of  the administration of the Arsenal  and the appointment of a Board of Management onthe lines recommended in their Second Interim Report, though they appreciate that it may be considered necessary that the functions of such a  Board should extend  beyond the factories at Woolwich, and bebrought into harmony with the  future organisation of the controlling authority at headquarters.    The later investigations of the  Committee into the costing system at Woolwich have confirmedtheir view as to the necessity for the adoption of the previous recommendations dealing with the futuremanagement of the Ordnance  Factories.    In conclusion, the Committee desire to record their appreciation of the work of their Secretary,who, in the midst  of a &quot;great deal of other work, has never failed to give very full attention to the  workof the  Committee, and has done his  work for them with great ability.                                          We are,                                               Your obedient Servants,                                      (Signed)  T.

THORNE.    We have signed these Reports, subiect to the following general reservations, which we desire should be applied inparticular to the recommendations dealing with the management, re-organisation of the lay-out, nature of work to beundertaken and the costing system to be adopted in future.    In our view the day has passed when changes of this character, which vitally affect the interests of the employees,should arbitrarily be instituted without regard to their effect on the workers, or without taking advantage of theirpractical experience and knowledge.    We are also strongly of the opinion that the machinery at Woolwich is not only capable of being used for the pro-duction and repair of Army and Navy requirements, but is also capable of and should be used for the production and repair of such things  as railway rolling stock, transport requisites, and articles and appliances required in connectionwith municipal and electrical undertakings.    While agreeing generally with the recommendations of the Committee, this is conditional upon effect being givento our reservations, and  in particular to the representatives of  the workmen being given an effective share in the determination of questions affecting the management and efficient working of the Arsenal.

THIRD  INTERIM  REPORT: COSTS.     The Committee have directed their attention mainly to an examination of the costing  system atpresent adopted at the Royal Ordnance Factories, Woolwich.  It was obvious to them that in orderto  fulfil its true  purpose whatever system of costing  was adopted at factories of the magnitude of woolwich should place :      (a) The Controlling Authority,     (6) The Supervisory Management,     (c) The Works Management,in a position to know at  short intervals as speedily and accurately as possible the  cost of producing atleast the principal articles manufactured, in order that:       (i) Fair comparisons of the cosb of production at Woolwich and other factories may be made;     &apos;(ii) Reasonably close estimates of the probable cost of fulfilling any particular proposed order may           be arrived at, and if necessary, considered in advance;     (hi) Variations in cost from  one period to another may be shown in such a manner that the different           processes of manufacture  can  be watched  during  immediately succeeding  periods with a           view to elimination of any inefficiencies or lack of economy ; and     (iv) Information may be available to Government Contracts Departments with which to check trade           prices.     A proper system of costing is essential to the efficient management of any productive undertaking,its chief value being to serve as a guide to those responsible for the control, supervision and management of the undertaking.     The Committee accordingly considered the system of costing in operation at Woolwich from these points of view, appreciating at the same time that problems of special difficulty were presented by  theexisting lay-out of the factories (already reported upon in the Second Interim Report of the Committee),the experimental work, the multifarious character of the production,  and various legacies of the pastaffecting piece-work prices, reserve capacity and machinery.     The main objects of the Ordnance Factories Manufacturing Accounts, presented to Parliament,are to charge the  different customers the Army, Navy, India, Colonies, &amp;c. the same average pricethroughout a given financial year for the same type of product, and at the same time to show as accu-rately as is practicable the cost price of the stores, the expenditure on repairs and maintenance.     The cost accounting  system at Woolwich was fully enquired into in 1902 by Mr. Morley,  of Messrs.Price, Waterhouse &amp; Co., Chartered Accountants, who examined the systems obtaining at certain privateengineering establishments.  He.stated that :-         &quot; the system of cost accounting at Woolwich appears as well adapted to obtain the results required        as  that in any of the works visited.   These results differ in character from those of commercial        houses, owing to the absence of profit considerations and to the requirements of Parliamentary        Returns.  ...&quot;    The method by which the cost prices are obtained is shortly described in Appendix A.    In  1902, however, the modern  commercial system of costing was hardly known.  Since then  themethods adopted in  engineering costing and the recognition of the importance of up-to-date accountscapable of affording short period results and comparative statistics for managerial purposes (which doesnot appear  to have been recognised in the scheme  of accounting laid down for the Royal  OrdnanceFactories) have enormously advanced.  It has, therefore, become desirable that some alteration in  thepresent system should be made.  The system, having regard to its limited objects, is thorough enough,and the Committee have formed the impression that it will correctly record what has happened.   With,annual accounts, however, which are not closed till from six to nine months after the end of the financialyear, the results when obtained,  while useful for  financial purposes and for enabling comparisons to bemade of one year with another, and to some extent with the  trade, are of little use for current anda immediate  control of costs of production.    During the war no complete accounts or statements of costs have been rendered by Woolwich,as stock has not been taken  since the beginning of the War,  so  that  even the yearly figures of costs of production are not now available.  So far as we have been able to ascertain, most of the new national factories have compiled each month figures of costs.  Woolwich, on the other hand, has only occasionallyprepared estimates of costs when specially requested to do so for a particular purpose.  The costingsystem  in vogue at Woolwich has proved incapable of being adapted  to the  conditions arising duringthe war. The control, supervision and management of Woolwich have in the main been conducted duringthe war without any adequate systematised knowledge of what the various products were costing, andthis, in our opinion,  is necessary for the efficient conduct of any undertaking.    We have had placed before us reports made by  officers of the Factory Audit and Costs Departmentof the Ministry of Munitions, as the result of full and detailed  examination of the Woolwich  system ofcosting.  It is not therefore necessary that we should do more than indicate  generally  the lines whichwe  consider the revision of the system should take.

Recommendation 1.    &quot; I. agree generally, but think it should be made clear that while the present system needs some development inorder &quot;to enable monthly costs to be readily extracted, it already enables cost prices of completed jobs to be taken out as soon as the jobs are completed an estimated rate of indirect expenditure of course being used.  I think it shouldalso be stated that it was the practice prior to the War to extract and furnish the managers with weekly and otherperiodic statistics of shop-non-production and certain other classes of indirect expenditure within their control.&quot;                                        Recommendation 4.    &quot; The chief value of extracting varying monthly and other approximate costs is cts stated at the beginning of thereport.  For the purpose, however, of charging the different government departments as shown in the AppropriationAccount,! consider that true annual costs determined in accordance with the general principles of the existing system.should continue to be utilised.&quot;             ALTERNATIVE  REPORT PREPARED  BY ME.  H. S. B. BRINDLEY.    The Committee have directed their attention mainly to an examination of the costing system atpresent adopted at the Royal Ordnance Factories, Woolwich.    The main  objects of the Ordnance Factories Manufacturing Accounts  presented to^ Parliamentare to charge the different customers the Army, Navy, India, Colonies, &amp;c. the same average pricethroughout a given financial year for the same type of product, and at the same time to show as accuratelyas practicable the cost price of the stores, the expenditure on repairs and maintenance.    The cost accounting system at Woolwich was fully enquired into in 1902 by Mr. Morley, of Messrs-Price, Waterhouse &amp; Co., Chartered Accountants, who examined the systems obtaining at certain privateengineering  establishments.  He stated  that:          &quot; the system  of cost accounting at Woolwich appears as well  adapted to obtain the  results         required as that in any of the works visited.  These results  differ in character from those of.         commercial houses, owing to the absence of profit considerations and to the requirements of.         Parliamentary Returns.  .  .  .&quot;(    The Committee accordingly recommend :     (1) That the present general system of  costing should be revised and developed and a system           introduced which will enable  monthly or other periodic statistics to be readily extracted,           the actual method adopted, i.e., job costing, process costing, or departmental costing, depend-           ing on the nature of the production and the particular local circumstances of each shop.    (2) That the system adopted should aim at placing in the hands of the management the earliest           and fullest possible information as to costs of current production, with a view to securing           efficiency and economy.    (3) That the costs of design and experimental work should in the first instance be kept entirely           separate from the costs of supply work.    (4) That the cost  system introduced should provide  for proper reconciliation with the  financial           books, so that inter alia  the  annual production accounts may prove the accuracy of the           periodical cost statistics furnished  to the Management.    (5) That overhead charges should be spread over the various products as accurately as possible           and by direct allocation where practicable.    (6) That up-to-date mechanical office appliances should be introduced.    (7) That a system of audit  of the accounts on commercial lines such as that established by the           Ministry of Munitions during the last 12 months should be retained.    (8) That specific provision should be made for the periodical overhauling of the accounting work           at the factories say every five or  ten years.    The Committee consider that the task of  both preparing and introducing the revised system shouldbe entrusted to a special  staff of  qualified commercial accountants, conversant with modern methods of cost accounting, who should be  appointed by the responsible Minister.  The costing staff, when thesystem is in operation,  should  be responsible  to the Chief Superintendent of the Ordnance Factories.
b&quot;     The method by which the cost prices are obtained is shortly described in Appendix A.     The system, having regard to limited objects, is thorough enough, and the Committee have formed the  impression  that  it will  correctly record  what  has happened.  With annual accounts, however,which are not closed till from six to nine months after the end of the financial year, the results whenobtained, while  useful for financial purposes and for enabling comparisons to be made of one year with another, and, to some extent, with the trade, are of little use for current and immediate control of costs of production.     During the  war no complete accounts or statements of costs have been rendered by Woolwich, asstock has not been taken since the beginning  of the war, so that even the yearly  figures of costs ofproduction are not now available.     Woolwich has only occasionally prepared -estimates of costs when specially requested to do so for aparticular purpose.  The  cost system in vogue at Woolwich has proved incapable of being adapted tothe  conditions arising during the war.   The control, supervision and management of  Woolwich have,in&quot; the main,  been conducted  during the war without any adequate systematised knowledge of what thevarious products were costing.     The Committee consider that whatever system of costing was  adopted at Woolwich, it  should enable the responsible authorities to  know speedily and accurately the cost of producing each articlemanufactured with periodic reports, at short intervals, with regard to the production  of those articlesproduced on  repetition lines.     The Committee are of  opinion that a  costing  system to be efficient should meet the followingrequirements:      (a) That fair comparisons of the cost of  production at Woolwich and other  factories may be made.     (6) Variations in cost from one period to another may be shown in such a manner that the different           processes of manufacture can be watched during immediately succeeding periods with a view           to the elimination of any inefficiencies or lack of economy.               This requirement would more particularly refer to repetition work.     (c) That information  may be available to Government Contracts Departments with which to check           trade prices.     The Committee attach great importance to the  establishment of an estimating department so thatclose estimates of the probable costs of  fulfilling any particular proposed  order may be arrived at and,if necessary,  considered in advance.   The estimating, to be  of  value,  would  require  to be  closelyco-ordinated  with the costing system and costs  compared with estimates.     The Committee recognise that the basis of cost  accounts is integral with the administration of theworkshops, and for this purpose it is requisite that in evolving any system there shall be close co-operationbetween engineers  and accountants,  and they therefore agree that  any  proposed  system should  beagreed not only with the responsible chief Administrative Officer at  Woolwich but also the Board ofControl before being put into operation.     The Committee recommend as follows :      (1) That the present general system of costing should be revised  and developed  and a system           introduced which will enable monthly or other periodic statistics to be readily extracted,           the  actual method adopted, i.e.,  job costing,  process costing,  or departmental costing,           depending on  the nature of the  production and the particular local circumstances of each           shop.     (2) That the system adopted should aim at  placing in  the hands of  the management the earliest           and  fullest possible information as to costs of current production, with a view to securing           efficiency and economy.           &apos;     (3) That the costs system introduced should provide for  proper reconciliation  with the financial           books, so that the  annual production accounts may  prove the accuracy of the periodical           cost  statistics  furnished to the management.     (4) That up-to-date mechanical office appliances should be introduced.     (5) That a  system of audit  of the accounts on commercial lines such as that established  by the           Ministry of Munitions during the last 12 months should be retained.     (6) That specific provision should be made for  the periodical overhauling  of the accounting work           at the factories,  say every five or ten years.     The Committee consider that the task of both preparing and introducing the revised system shouldbe  entrusted to a special  staff of engineers with wide administration experience  and  accountants  withan intimate knowledge of cost accounting, this staff to be appointed by the responsible Minister.  Thesystem, when approved by the Board of Control, would be installed under the general direction of theChief  Superintendent  of Factories,  and  when satisfactorily  established he  would take  completeresponsibility.

                                        APPENDIX A.    METHOD  BY  WHICH  COST  PRICES AT  WOOLWICH  ARE OBTAINED UNDER                                     PRESENT  SYSTEM.    (i) Each product,* e.g., machined body, 18-pr. shell, is made on one  syllabus or cost order for theyear.   To that order in the cost ledger is charged weekly:     (a) The  direct operatives&apos; wages increased by  a percentage designed to spread the shop-non-           productive weekly wages.    (b) The value of materials.    (c) Machine charges.    (ii) The  operators&apos; time wages or piece-work earnings are recorded currently by the worktaker inthe shops to the orders.  The shop-non-productive wages referred to under (a) include wages of  foremen,cranemen,  sweepers, night shift  allowance of operatives,  and  other wages charges  capable  of directallocation to the shop but not to the job itself.  The total of the shop-non-productive is spread weeklyby a percentage over the direct labour wages in the shop. The spreading is done by the accounts branch,and the final wages entries in the cost ledgers do not distinguish between the operatives&apos; wages and thispercentage addition.    (iii) Materials obtained (a) from stores are issued at the store account price ;  (b) from the foundryor forge at fixed prices revised quarterly according to the state of the foundry account; (c)  from oneof the other factories at the actual or estimated cost ledger price plus an estimated on-cost.    (iv) The identification number of a machine working on an order is recorded currently by the work-takers.  The charges, either at an hourly rate or by means  of a percentage on the operatives&apos; earnings atthe machine, are worked out and charged by the accounts branch.  The rate or percentage  is a fixedrate, and any balance on the machinery account is charged to I.E.&apos;    (v) Production and rejections on the order are recorded and  reported as made for entry in theproduction ledger.   The total net production on each order during each financial year is thus  obtained.    (vi) The indirect expenditure of the factory is written up weekly,  monthly or yearly, according tothe nature of the item.    (vii) At the  end of the financial year the indirect expenditure, after allowing for those portionsspecially allocated is spread by a general percentage over  the wages totals on the different  cost orders,and the total expenditure which each order is to carry for the year is thus obtained.    (viii) At the end  of the financial year the semi-manufactures, or work in  progress on  each  costorder still open, is valued out  by a stocktaking, which necessitates closing down for three or four days.The cost order is relieved of the value of the outstanding semi-manufactures, which value is  carried overas a charge to the cost order of the following year. The total expenditure within the year on each order(see (vii)), reduced by the semi-manufactures at the end of the year and increased by the semi-manufacturesat the end of the preceding year, represents the cost of the net production on the order (see (v)).  Henceby division the average annual cost per article for the year is obtained.    &quot; Operation &quot; costs involved in the completion of a product or component part of a product are not usually obtained as such, e.g., the cost of machining the empty shell is obtained, but not of the separateoperations, as there is only one schedule order in such case to which all the ooerations charges go.    * In some cases a group of related articles are made on one syllabus order  and the cost price of thegroup distributed by professional estimate among the members of  the group.
                             SECOND  INTERIM   REPORT.                                                                         22nd November, 1918.THE RIGHT HON.  WINSTON S. CHURCHILL, M.P.,             MINISTER OF MUNITIONS.SIR,-    Your Committee, in submitting their Second Interim Report, desire at the outset to say that anyenquiry into a Government arsenal and its location must necessarily be affected by problems regardingarmament production  as a whole, as well as by questions of future policy, which at the present momenthave  not been and cannot be authoritatively laid down.   We have  therefore been obliged to frameour report on such assumptions  as appeared to us most likely to  be  realised.  We early came to theconclusion that we could best satisfy the requirements of the Enquiry by basing our report on a com-prehensive survey of the principles indicated in the terms of reference  without attempting to enter intothe subsidiary and smaller details of organisation and equipment.  These we consider best left for settle-ment  in the manner detailed below.I. Armament Production after the War: Government Arsenal and Private Factories.    In the first place, it is necessary to review briefly the  probable position of the country as regardsarmament production  after peace has been declared.    The conditions as  regards the limitations of armaments, which the Allied Powers will be in a positionto enforce at the conclusion of peace, make it reasonable to  assume  that the manufacture of armamentswill be considerably reduced after the war,  as compared  with production in the years immediately preceding hostilities.  Moreover,  shortly after the declaration of peace, demobilisation will commence,and the Army will be very considerably reduced.   There will, therefore, be a very large surplus of gunsand all war appliances, as well as enormous reserves of ammunition.   It does not fall within our provinceto consider how these will be treated or disposed  of, but one main fact  must remain, and that is thatreserves of guns  and ammunition and all war appliances will be retained sufficient to last the countryfor peace purposes and a moderate reserve for war for at least ten years, this period being fixed merelyfrom  considerations of the  probable life of cordite.    Assuming this to be so, it will still be vitally necessary for the Government to  continue to carryout experiments with  new forms  of weapons and new developments in the material for war introduced by scientific research,  and therefore a factory or factories either owned by the Government or private trade will be required  for this purpose.    We consider that the arguments in favour of the retention of a Government arsenal in peace time are overwhelming.  In the first place secrecy, which is often a great essential in armament development,can more easily be preserved in a Government establishment.   Secondly, the close relations that mustexist  between the Ordnance Committee and the factory, including financial details,  will be more satis-factorily arranged with a Government establishment.  Thirdly, repair work, which may form an essentialmainstay of the productive factory, is  better undertaken under Government control.  In this respectalso it is of value that  repair work should be undertaken in the factory  that is most closely in touch withdesign, in order that failures and weak construction should be prominently brought to the notice  ofdesigners.  This can best be affected by both the main design office and factory being under government control.  .Moreover, it is necessary to bear in mind the assistance which  such an arsenal can render  intraining the personnel of new factories, when expansion is suddenly required.    Assuming, therefore, that a Government factory is kept in existence, and that the supply of arma-ments is greatly reduced in quantity, it more or less follows that the present outlay of the larger private firms  for armament production will be considerably reduced, and such manufacture will not improbablydisappear as a speciality.  It is also probable that the country will  insist on the production of all arma-ments being confined  to Government factories; nor would the disappearance of the larger armament firms  materially handicap production in the event of a serious war, since during the present war a verylarge  number of engineering firms have been educated in armament manufacture,  and the basis forarmament suppty is now so broad that specialising in  the future  on  the part of a limited number  of firms  will probably not be necessary for the safety of the country.   The magnitude of present-day waroperations is such that&apos; the reserve of manufacture in peacetime for war development cannot be lookedon as being concentrated in the Government arsenal and two or three particular firms.   The real reserve for war is the whole of the manufacturing power of the country, which has been educated in the supplyof armaments.    At the same time, if a Government factory is established,  a certain reserve for  expansion of thatfactory is necessary, since small wars may still occur on the frontiers or borders of the Empire, and a,quick and moderate expansion of output may at any time be desirable.  Should re-armament of anyparticular branch become necessary, the supplementary manufacturing capacity should be supplied bythe normal engineering works of the country.  Presumably, therefore, the Government arsenal of thefuture will be a  comparatively small establishment  with a  certain reserve of productive power in thecase of a small war, and specialising on the part of private  enterprise will gradually disappear.II. Location of Government Arsenal.    Assuming, therefore, that a Government establishment is to be maintained, the  question of  itslocation arises whether the present position of  Woolwich is the best,  or whether any other of the
national  factories might reasonably  be considered superior in location.   Various arguments can  be advanced against Woolwich Arsenal  as a site for a Government factory.   It is necessary to considerthe main objections in detail.    In the first place, there is  no doubt that the  distance of the Arsenal from the coal areas increases the cost of production.  Direct sea transport of coal should, however, be developed.    Secondly, the distance from steel centres entails increased railway transport of forgings and material.This probably would affect the cost of production but little, if at all.  If a gun, for instance, is manu-factured  at Sheffield the finished gun is probably delivered to Woolwich.  It is true the total weightof the forgings  sent to Woolwich for manufacture into a gun is considerably greater than that of the finished product, but on the other hand, the railway rate charged for finished articles is greater than forforgings.  So that the net railway cost of supplying material to Woolwich is not far different from thatof supplying  the finished article.  Again,  if articles  are eventually transported in approximately equalquantities to  the depots in the north and south of the country the average railway mileage is the samewhether they are supplied from the centre of England or Woolwich.    Thirdly,  the arsenal situated in the south-and east of the country is generally assumed to be moreopen to aerial attack than  in the north and west; but looking ahead, in a few years, as the radius ofaction of bombing machines grow, all parts of the country will be almost equally open to foreign aerialattack.   Moreover, Woolwich must be looked upon mainly as a peace-producing arsenal and, at the out-side, only capable of producing a very small percentage of&quot;the total armament requirements for a seriouswar.    Fourthly, the river frontage, it may be argued, is valuable for commercial  enterprise;  but large areas bordering the river still  exist, should such developments occur.    Fifthly, it  has been stated as a reason against  the retention of Woolwich Arsenal that the labour conditions existing there have a hampering effect on the management, and are such as to make the costof production higher than at the national  factories erected during  the  war.   We are unable to  speakauthoritatively on this latter point since we have been unable to obtain strictly comparable figures of costs.  In fact, owing to the absence of any system of current costs at Woolwich, we have been unableto obtain any  reliable figures from there.  We consider,  however,  that any special labour  provisionsnow in force  at Woolwich will automatically cease with the termination of the war, and we can see  noReason why conditions should in future exist at Woolwich different from those inherent in any Govern-ment factory.  We also consider that arrangements should be made for establishing close and regularcommunication and  interchange of views between the management  aiid the employees.   We are con-vinced that if this is done any difficulties of the past will be capable of  mutual adjustment.     Lastly, it may  be urged that the lay-out of Woolwich is more or  less impossible for economicalproduction.  We do not regard this condition as insuperable.   It is true that Woolwich now presentsconsiderable  disadvantages for manufacture from congestion, owing to  its poor  internal railway com-munications,  the wide separation of certain units  which should be more closely associated, and theovercrowding in shops,  largely due to the  war emergency installation of extra machinery without thetime  being available to reconstruct the internal and  external shop communication.  When, however,the shops in  the factory assume a more normal establishment in peace time, many of the working diffi-culties will to a certain extent disappear.  We  recommend later in our report the appointment of  an expert committee specially to consider the remodelling of the Arsenal.     Had,  however, the retention of a large  arsenal been  contemplated, in all probability  we shouldhave recommended a considerable section  being located elsewhere  than at Woolwich, but in the caseof an establishment of such a size as we consider will  be required, we have come to the conclusion thatWoolwich is  the  natural and most  convenient  place for such an arsenal.  In arriving at this decisionwe have been guided by five considerations :      (1) At Woolwich there already exists manufacturing capacity and  experimental facilities for prac-           tically all classes of war material.     (2) No individual national factory possesses the plant for manufacture of  all  classes of armaments,           nor could any be adapted without an expense,  probably far  in  excess of the sum necessary           to effect a re-organisation of the lay-out at Woolwich.     (3)  The  close proximity of Woolwich  to Government Departments in London, and also the main           experimental establishment of the Ordnance Committee  and Shoeburyness, presents advan-           tages which factories further afield would not possess.  It is generally agreed that experimental           manufacture is largely valueless unless it is associated with  manufacture on a supply scale.           If,  therefore, Woolwich is the most  suitable locality for experimental work,  it also follows           that the  Government factory should be located in the same place.     (4)  Certain topographical features and facilities make Shoeburyness a unique range for long-distance           firing.  No other such site is readily available.  As the arsenal engaged on experimental           manufacture should be near the trial grounds, its location must be in the vicinity  of London.     (5)  The  trained  personnel whose permanent residence before  the  war was  in the locality would           still remain, and help somewhat to reduce what in any case  must be a serious dislocation of           local conditions.  Even with the drastic  reduction in supply that peace conditions will bring,           there need be no doubt that sufficient employment will  exist to keep a moderate factory at           work, since  branches  of manufacture such as  mines, tanks  and other stores not at present           produced in the Arsenal, together with the whole of  wood-working, supply of boxes and           such necessary details for munitions and the Air Service will naturally be produced at the           Arsenal.   With efficient management, no doubt, the variety  of detail will largely  increase.     (C 3753)                                                                            C2
    In this connection  we desire to urge strongly the  desirability of  the  Government Departmentsconcerned placing as many orders as possible with the Arsenal for manufacture and repair, and parti-cularly for naval, military, or other Government stores not now produced or repaired there,  such, forexample, as Tanks, Mechanical Transport, and possibly Naval Hydraulic Mountings. We do not advocatethat this should be done on an uneconomic basis, but we put forward this suggestion from the point ofview of minimising the depression which may arise in Woolwich from a drastic reduction of the establish-ment as well as providing a larger nucleus for expansion in  case of emergency.   We do not feel  thatit is within our province to put forward detailed suggestions as to the  nature of such work.  We areglad, however,  to learn that the question is already engaging the serious attention of the Ministry.III. Size of Woolwich Arsenal  in Future.     It is impossible  to ascertain at the  present moment, nor have we any means of investigating theproblem of the  exact size that the Arsenal should assume after the conclusion of peace.  On this questionnaturally would depend any detailed recommendation as regards its future lay-out.   We are therefor of the opinion that an expert committee  should be appointed which should advise the Board of Manage-ment (vide paragraph IV (3)), and submit detailed plans and proposals for the remodelling of the Arsenaland  the reorganisation of its communications on the scale that will be laid down by the responsible minister in London, and at the  same time report as to the disposal and future uses of the surplus plant and stores.    Before passing to the question  of administration, we should like to say that we consider it  most desirable that the experiences of all those who have been responsible for the production of munitionsduring the war should be collected and clearly placed on record.  We feel that a document containingsuch experiences would  prove invaluable in the  event of a  future serious war.   We are glad to  learn that this work  is being undertaken by the Ministry, so far as their activities are concerned.IV. Administration  of Arsenal.    At the same time as the material of the Arsenal at Woolwich is reorganised we consider that radical changes should  be made in the method of administration   We  find that at present     (a) The control  of  Woolwich Arsenal is vested in  three  Government  Departments, each acting8          independently of the other, with no direct co-ordinated control,  viz.              The Ministry of Munitions, the Admiralty, and the  War Office.        The  Ministry of Munitions control extends to                The Ordnance Factories (under the  Chief Superintendent of Ordnance Factories, re-                   sponsible to Member of Council &quot; 0 &quot;).               The Inspection Department; the Research Department; and the  Ordnance Committee;                   all three of which are under Member of Council &quot; D.&quot;               The Senior Bond Officer (forming part of the Central Stores Department of the Ministry,                   in the Finance Group).               Bach of the above five Departments and bodies  of the Ministry located at Woolwich are           independent  of the other. -               The  Admiralty  administer at Woolwich the Naval Ordnance Department,  which is           responsible for Naval Stores  and the  Naval Inspection Department.   They  also place con-           siderable orders direct with the Chief Superintendent  of Ordnance Factories, without reference           to the Ministry of Munitions.               The War Office  have under their control at Woolwich Arsenal the Deputy Director of           Ordnance Stores in  charge  of  the Ordnance Department and  the  Assistant Director of           Military Transport.    (b) In the  Ordnance Factories there are ten departments (employing in all over 64,000 employees),           each directly responsible, through its superintendent, to C.S.O.F.     (c) In the  case of the Royal Gun and  Carriage Factories, Building Works Department, Mechanical           Engineering, East and West Laboratory, Filling Factories, Small Arms Ammunition Factories           (which together employ  over 90 per  cent, of the workpeople in the  Ordnance Factories),           eight of the controllers, superintendents, deputy  and assistant superintendents are military           officers, while four only are civilians,  the C.S.O.F. himself being  also  a military officer.     (d) There is no organisation for viewing the  labour problems of the Arsenal as a whole.     (e) From the point of view of the management, the costing system at  the Arsenal requires to be           reorganised,  but we have not yet received the report of a  sub-committee which we  have           appointed to consider the whole question of accounts. In pre-war days the accounts provided           the  War  Office, Admiralty and Parliament with the most detailed analysis  of the costs of           production and of the various sums spent in  the different departments, somewhere between           six  and eighteen months after the expenditure, but even these detailed accounts have been           suspended during the  war.   What is infinitely more important, however, from a practical           and economical point of view, is to keep the managers of the shops informed of all fluctua-           tions in expenditure in their departments and as early as possible of  the costs of the  work           newly completed. Without such a system which is the backbone of  economical production           &apos;n commercial enterprises-f actors leading to a considerable loss of money may creep in without
          detection until it is too late to arrest the loss which earlier information might have avoided,          while there can be no preventive to loss in the taking on of new similar work.  Again,          incentive to economy is wanting unless costs  and expenditure can be readily compared.          No such system exists at Woolwich.  Undoubtedly the pressure of war work may be advanced          for this omission, but there can be no excuse for the absence of a system which is absolutely          essential for economical production.  However interesting and valuable the analysis that is          eventually produced may be,  it is back history and cannot affect present expenditure.    We therefore consider it to be of great importance that the following recommendations  should beadopted :     (1)  That one Minister should be solely responsible for the entire control of Woolwich Arsenal.    (2)  That Woolwich should cease to be used for the storage of munitions of war and other completed          stores.  It is  difficult to imagine a place less suited for the storage of explosives than a          manufacturing arsenal situated in a thickly populated district.  For the reason  of  avoiding          congestion it is unwise to combine general storage with manufacturing capacity.    (3)  That a Board of Management should be appointed by the responsible Minister to act in a capacity          similar to  that of a Board of Directors of a  commercial undertaking  whose duty it should          be to sit (say  monthly) and to receive the report of the Managing Director and the heads of          departments,  and analyse  the  current costs  and variations in expenditure, keeping them-          selves fully in touch with the interests of  the factory.   The composition of this  Board          should be  as follows :                The Chairman should be a man of well-knoMm repute and standing, with knowledge of                   business concerns but not  connected  with private enterprises producing articles                   similar to those manufactured at Woolwich.               A representative each of the Admiralty, War Office, Ministry of Munitions, and  Air                   Ministry.               Two independent engineers of high repute.               President of Ordnance Committee (ex officio).               Managing Director (ex officio).               The non-departmental members should  be  unpaid.  . The unique national nature of the          work would undoubtedly attract  the requisite high talent required.               The Board should investigate and put forward all proposals for expenditure on buildings          and plant.  Salaries should be assessed by them, with a view to keeping them  in line with          . those paid in commercial undertakings.  The relative duties of the Superintendent  of Works,          Mechanical Engineer,  and Traffic Controller, and other principal heads of independent depart-          ments would be reviewed and provided for according to the particular requirements of the          Arsenal.   The reserve section of  the Arsenal should occupy their particular attention, and          they should be responsible for its  being equipped with plant and accessories and in a manner          best suited to supply the engineering trade of  the country with  such &quot; first aid  &quot; as may          be necessary in the event of the manufacturing resources of the country for war being again          mobilised.   They should examine, with the Managing Director, and such other assistance as          may be necessary, the internal labour organisation, with a view to introducing more modern          methods governing the relations between  the  management and the  employees.  We are          convinced  that if this is done and machinery set up  which will have the confidence of both          parties, the majority of the labour troubles that  IIOAV exist will be adjusted without  difficulty.    (4)  That the post of Chief  Superintendent of Ordnance Factories should be abolished  and that          the Minister should appoint a Managing Director for the whole Arsenal, having under him          for administrative purposes the superintendents of all departments in the Arsenal (including          those performing work for the Admiralty and War Office).               The Managing Director should be a trained  engineer, and would report to the Board.               If a civilian, he should have  a military officer appointed as an assistant.  .  *  (5)  That trained engineers should be placed in charge of each of the productive departments at the          Arsenal and, if civilian, should have military assistants attached to them as necessary.  The          possession of a university engineering degree should not be regarded as an absolutely indis-          pensable qualification for  such appointments.    (6)  That the Managing Director and the superintendents and managers of the various departments          and factories should receive salaries commensurate with the importance of the appointments,          and comparable with those paid  for similar  work by outside firms.    (7)  Various other matters affecting the  administration of the Arsenal,  such as the machinery for          dealing with labour,  the co-ordination of the various departments within the Arsenal, the          division  of their duties, and the adjustment  of  relative priority of manufacturing work, we          consider best left to the Managing Director and the proposed Board of Management  to          arrange.   We have not therefore  dealt with these questions in our report.&apos;V. Design and Drawing Office.    The question of the Drawing Office and its relation to the Arsenal inevitably leads to a considerationof the whole question of design of armaments.    The keystone of efficient armament  production is design.  In  our opinion improvements  are neces-sary in  the present arrangements.
     So far as we can ascertain, the present procedure regarding military munitions is as follows :      The Controller of Munitions Design (C.M.D.) receives requisitions for new designs and sends themto the Ordnance Committee.  This body of officers of high attainments and scientific ability possessesa dual function, namely the initiation and review of research and the criticism of design.  When requi-sitioned for a design, they call  on any or all of the principal designing offices, viz., Woolwich Arsenal,Messrs. Armstrong, Messrs. Vickers, the Coventry Ordnance Works, or Messrs. Beardmore, for designs.These they review, criticise and amend, initiate such trials as they may deem to be advisable and  finallymake recommendations to C.M.D., who, in conjunction with the War Office, approves the design.     Woolwich  Drawing Office is divided into sections, each under a superintendent of a section  of theArsenal, none of whom are technical designing engineers.   The drawing office has its own head draughts-men, but these hold subordinate positions so far as control is concerned.     On the other hand, the designing offices of the large firms are under a designing engineer of experience with comparatively little expert assistance from military officers.     There is also  in addition a Superintendent of Design a military officer who was appointed toact for C.S.O.F, and who is the technical Head of Design in the Arsenal.  This officer is an ex-officiomember of the Ordnance Committee and its mouthpiece to Woolwich design.   Apparently he has aconsiderable voice in R.L. Design,  in  which  department  he has  installed two designing officers&apos;.   Asimilar arrangement has not been adopted  in the Gun and Carriage Factories, and therefore the Superin-tendent  of Design has little to say  on design in  these departments.  The Superintendent of the GunFactory initiates gun design for the  Arsenal,  of which  matters he has considerable  experience. the design in the Carriage Department is undertaken by three assistants ; gun carriages by a military officerlately a professor at the Ordnance College  ; woodworking by a temporary  officer, late railway engineer ;and plant by a temporary officer, late  civd engineer.     We are convinced that the whole system of munitions design is on a wrong basis and that considerableimprovements can be effected both at Woolwich and also in the functions of the Ordnance Committee.The duties of  the Ordnance Committee, so far as design is  concerned, are advisory.   We consider thatthey should be executive, i.e., designs emanating from the Committee should be  approved by the Presi-dent of  the Ordnance Committee with whom  the responsibility should  rest.  The President of theCommittee would  therefore become the Controller of Design.  The acceptance of the design should,however, rest entirely with the Army Council and the Admiralty.   .     We consider that the present Woolwich Drawing Office should be entirely reconstituted to formthe main armament design office of the Government.  It should still be situated at the Arsenal, so asto keep  the designing draughtsmen in  close touch with the latest shop  practices.  They should alsowitness all trials in which their design is implicated.     We also consider that the Design Office should be placed directly under a carefully selected DesigningEngineer who,  on design questions, should act under the instructions of the President of the OrdnanceCommittee.     The personnel of the Design Office situated  at Woolwich would be under  the Managing Directorand the Board of Management for discipline and pay.     The  President of the  Ordnance Committee would be  an ex-officio  member of the  Board of: Management.     Both the Managing Director and the Designing Engineer should be ex-officio members of the OrdnanceCommittee.     We consider the present division of the Committee into  sub-committees excellent, but would liketo see this amplified in two respects:  First to include trench warfare, chemical warfare, tanks, andany military experimental and design  committees, and secondly that the sub-committees should beDesign Sub-Committees whose functions would be, under the President, to initiate and approve designs,any number of the sub-committees sitting together as the  President may desire in cases where inter-locking of the design with details dealt with by more than one sub-committee may occur.  Considerablesimplication and saving of time we are convinced would result from these arrangements.     If the above  general principles be accepted, the constitution and duties  of the sub-committeesremain for consideration.     The present constitution appears good, but the following procedure is recommended in the preparationof design.     At the first meeting of  the sub-committee to consider a called-for design, the superintendent ofthe section of the factory concerned should attend as an ex-officio member, and, if necessary, theSuperin-tendent of Research, also the Designing Engineer or his  deputy.  When the approximate line of  designhas been settled the design should be left in charge of  the Designing Engineer for mechanical details and the sub-committee for all military questions.  When the rough design  is completed the sub-committee and ex-officio members meet and the design is reviewed from the manufacturing side andmodified as necessary.  A meeting is held to  approve  the complete design, which  is signed by thePresident. Detailed drawings as produced by the Design Office should be initialled  by the DesigningEngineer and the Section Manager of the Arsenal, to confirm limits and to show the concurrence of thelatter in the design so far as facility of manufacture and  suitability of material for general supply in wartime are concerned.     The same procedure would take place in the case of  design submitted  by private firms, except thatthe Designing Engineer of the firm would attend before the sub-committee, in the place of the DesigningEngineer, Woolwich, the latter being always available for  consultation.  In  all probability, however,private design will decrease largely  in the future, as armament manufacture  ceases to be a subject ofcommercial production.    There need  be no fear that the Design Sub-Committee would be biassed in favour of Woolwich by
the arrangement, as it is immaterial which Designing Engineer personality and attainments neglected they work with.    By this means uniform procedure and machinery are ensured in case munition design and manu-facture on the part of private firms languish after the war.    We also consider that a section of the Woolwich Drawing Office should be organised specially forthe design of jigs, gauges and special tools a branch of design which requires special experience.  Thissection should work in the closest connection with the  superintendents and foremen of the shops con-cerned, and in its work be directly under the Managing Director and not the Ordnance Committee.  Thesupply of the necessary drawings of these articles is the  first requisite of war expansion.    We are further of opinion that considerable care should be taken  in the selection of the head and principal draughtsmen, and that salaries equal to those paid by outside firms should be arranged.    A branch of the Drawing Office under the Designing Engineer should be located in the Main supply department in London, which would centralise the  present small departmental drawing offices in theMinistry of Munitions.  A registry of drawings for reference should be  instituted in order to give readyinformation on any points of detail that may arise.VI. Inspection.    The Inspection Department should be  under the responsible Minister, but should  not be under or be administered by the head of a supply sub-department.  The immediate control of inspection shouldbe  quite independent of the immediate control of both supply  and  manufacture,  but the inspectionstaff located at Woolwich should be under the Managing  Director and Board of Management for purposesof discipline and  possibly pay.    The Inspection Department should be kept in the closest  touch with design, and we are of  opinionthat all suggestions from Woolwich and outside manufacturers for cheapening manufacture or increasingoutput, including &quot;alteration  in tolerances, should be made direct to the Ordnance Committee throughthe Chief Inspector, Woolwich.    As certainly the majorit)&apos;&apos; and probably the whole amount of manufacture during peace will before long be produced at Woolwich, we consider that this is  the proper place for the Head Inspection Branchto be located.  In the case of a future serious war,  immediate decentralisation should take place, andan organisation on the lines  of that now in  existence should be instituted.   The inspection staff should act as instructors to  skilled mechanics in order to  supplement the local inspection staff of the largerengineering firms.     The issue of  drawings to guide manufacture after sealing by the Chief Inspector should be under-taken by  a special branch of the main drawing office, which should be  organised and equipped for considerable expansion.VII. Summary of the Main Conclusions.     1. That the arguments in favour of the retention of a Government arsenal for munition manufacture in peace time are overwhelming.     2. That the location of that Government arsenal should be at Woolwich.     3. That Woolwich Arsenal should be organised  mainly as a  peace establishment for the supply ofarmaments in peace time and of experimental types and improved design in  war and peace.   That itshould  also be capable of immediate supply of design for jigs  and  gauges of all current articles of-armaments immediately on  mobilisation of the engineering resources of the country for war,  and alsobe in a position to send technical manufacturing advice to the firms involved.     That its reserve of expansion, so far as its peace lay-out  is concerned, be limited to increased pro-duction in the case  of small wars.     That, on the other hand, the Design Department should be organised so as to fulfil all requirementsof design  in peace time, at the outbreak of war,  and during a war on the largest scale.     4.  That am expert committee be appointed to submit proposals for the reorganisation of the lay-outof the Arsenal on a scale to be determined by the responsible Minister.     5.  That immediate consideration be given to the placing  of as many orders as possible with Wool-wich, particularly for Military, Naval, or other Government Stores not now produced or repaired there,e.g., Tanks, Mechanical Transport, and possibly Naval Hydraulic  Mountings.     6.  That one Minister only should be responsible for the control of the Arsenal.     7.  That a  Board of Management, as outlined, be constituted and the Board to have functions asindicated in the main report.     8.  That a trained engineer be appointed as  Managing  Director to manage the whole Arsenal, andbe directly responsible to the Board of Management.     9.  That trained engineers should, under the Managing  Director, be placed in charge of each of the manufacturing departments.     10. That the salaries paid to the  Managing Director, the Superintendents, Managers,^DesigningEngineer, Head Draughtsmen and Draughtsmen, should be commensurate with the importance of theappointment and comparable with those jjaid in commercial undertakings.     11. That Woolwich should cease to be  used as a storage depot for completed ammunition and finished stores, all stores not required in the factory, and especially filled ammunition, to be removed as soon as possible.     12. That, so far as design is concerned, the duties of the Ordnance Committee should become execu-tive, instead of merely advisory,  the  President of  the Ordnance Committee becoming the Controller of Munitions Design.
    * Mr. Currie desires to add that until the proposed Committee on the lay-out of the Arsenal referredto in paragraph VII (4) has reported, Lord Marchamley&apos;s suggestion  (see attached supplementary report) that the alternative facilities at certain of the new factories should at least be held in reserves should not be overlooked.    f Mr. Hills signs the Report subject to the following reservations :     (1) The existing Ordnance Factories Cost Accounts were designed primarily to meet the conditions          of Parliamentary accounting as  between  the Factories, the War  Office, Admiralty,  &amp;c.          It does not appear to have  been the  practice of the Management to make any appreciable          use of these accounts for the purpose  of ascertaining  the current costs of their products.          The  question what changes might be required in the  account system to meet this end is          before a sub-committee, and I do not  wish to anticipate its findings in the matter.    (2) The deliberations of the Committee did not make clear what meaning is intended to be attached          to the word control in Sect. IV.   If it means that no department other than a branch of the          Ministry can be  allowed to remain in  the Arsenal, I do not  agree.  If it means that  one          authority should  control such matters as lighting, fire ricks, police and other general services          in the Arsenal, it asserts what was the practice in pre-war days.    (3)  The recommendation to remove all stores (not merely explosives)  from Woolwich Arsenal raises          some questions of Finance and Labour policy that have not been considered by the Committee          or by some  of the War  Office Departments concerned.  I cannot therefore agree in  that          recommendation.g Subject to reservations included in final Report    13.  That the Drawing Offices at Woolwich should be entirely reconstituted to form the main Arma-ment Design Office of the Government under a carefully selected Designing Engineer acting on designquestions under the instructions of the President of the Ordnance Committee.    14.-.  That the Managing Director and the Designing Engineer should be ex-officio members of the ordnance Committee.    15.  That the present division of the Ordnance Committee into sub-committees should be amplifiedfirst to include Trench Warfare, Chemical Warfare, Tanks, and any Military Experimental and DesigningCommittee;  and secondly, that the sub-committees should be Design Sub-Committees whose functionwould be, under the President, to  initiate and approve designs.    16.  That a section of the Woolwich Drawing Office be organised specially for the design of jigs andgauges and special tools.    17.  That a branch of the Drawing Office should be located in the Main Supply Department in London.    18.  That the Headquarters of the Inspection Department should continue to be at Woolwich.  ,&apos; * -                                                           i                                  We are, Sir,                                                Your obedient Servants,                                          (Signed)     T.

SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT BY LORD  MARCHAMLEY.     I regret that I am unable to agree with the general conclusions of the Second Interim Report of the^Committee.  In my view the arguments for and against the retention of the Arsenal at Woolwich are so evenly balanced that a decision as to the future of Woolwich must turn on the possibility, or otherwise, of assimilating labour conditions there with those which obtain elsewhere.     It has been urged by many prominent witnesses that before Woolwich Arsenal could be placed on a really satisfactory basis, it might be necessary to close it down altogether in  order that, when restarted, it should be so &quot; freed from all old customs, piece-work prices, and pledges to labour.&quot;     Without advocating such an extreme course, it might be desirable to set out shortly some of the very strong arguments in favour of its removal elsewhere.     Woolwich is badly situated  for an arsenal.  Railway communication with it is not good ; it is remote from its coal and iron supplies ;  it is peculiarly open to aerial attack  ; it is built on low marshy land many feet below high-water mark, and so foundations  are treacherous.  It  is within the area  of the London rate  of wages ;  labour has been described as unduly &quot; militant&quot; there.  The river, which one would naturally expect to furnish a cheap means of carriage, is little used, and no completed ammuni- tion or guns are shipped from there.  We have been told it is, and must remain, the home for experimental work, but even experimental work is not indigenous only to Woolwich soil, and  the whole of it is  as&apos; easily removable from the Arsenal as the heavy machinery  in the big gun  factory.   The only things that can be said in favour of Woolwich are its proximity to London and to Shoeburyness.  But the great. arsenals in Germany, Austria and Prance are not in the vicinity of their capitals, and the great armament firms in England are not clustered round Shoeburyness.  So that these two excellent advantages are not indispensable.     If, as is contemplated,  work upon  a much reduced scale is to continue at Woolwich,  almost the whole of the West Laboratory will require to be remodelled  and the factories regrouped.  One cannot&apos; disguise the fact that this would be  an  exceedingly costly operation.   No one who is acquainted with its labyrinth of narrow twisting streets  and  alleys, threading their ways among dark and old shops  in many of which it is difficult to get folk to work, can fail to appreciate this.   Western Woolwich is little&apos; otherwise than a manufacturing maze and muddle.  A general judgment is well voiced by Sir  Vincent Raven when he says that in order to construct a new, well-planned, up-to-date system of factories there, almost a clean sweep would  be necessary and a complete rebuilding must take place.  Only after careful- consideration by experts could the cost  of all this be estimated.  The whole  policy is open to question, and the more  so when one  remembers that the Ministry possesses national factories  to a surplusage elsewhere, more  easily adapted and  capable of housing many times  over all the work that might be transferred there from Woolwich.      Also, from a labour point of view, there is in truth much to be urged in favour of a complete removal of all work from Woolwich, if a removal on any big scale is contemplated.  The Arsenal, situated on the south bank of the Thames, stretching nearly four miles from east to west and between half  a mile to a mile in depth, provides, and the site must always furnish, the big field almost the only field-for work-and employment there.   Busy at the Arsenal and thronged with labour, Woolwich is prosperous and well-to-do.  Labour reduced to a minimum, it becomes almost a decaying city. Some say&apos;&apos; Let Woolwich revert to its pre-war state;&quot;  but it must be remembered that the big closing down before the war occa- sioned great want and privation, and as Woolwich has grown considerably during  the war, the Ministry itself having largely added  to  it by the construction of houses, many of a permanent character, this distress would be accentuated.      The Arsenal and Dockyard find employment now  for over 100,000 people.   If these numbers are to be reduced to pre-war figures, and as national requirements for munitions and armament will be in future small, probably six or seven thousand or even less will be retained in a so-called nucleus Arsenal. What is going to be the value of house and shop property at Woolwich and the state of employment there under such conditions ?   How can it be adjudged right to retain a skeleton arsenal, manned  by such- a sparse and scattered crew, in  this favourable and valuable area, where docks, riverside, and other industries might abound and flourish?  Surely Labour at Woolwich would be more than  justified in saying, &quot; If necessity compels  you to  cut down Arsenal employment so terribly, better do your job thoroughly and take your remnant away also.  Do it gradually so as to cause as little suffering in the process as you can, and trade off your  valuable land to be covered by shipping and other  commercial- enterprises, to the end that  we may live!&quot;  They will not get much chance otherwise !      Reviewing the preceding and attempting to sum it up, I would venture to press home  that this is a juncture when it is necessary to take long and far-sighted views.  Which is the wiser policy, to attempt to remodel and rebuild a big part of Woolwich, entailing an expenditure of  a large sum of money, and then only succeeding in obtaining a  patchwork lot of factories, badly placed as an arsenal and subject to many of the disadvantages enumerated above ; or boldly to face the situation and going further afield, to spend a larger amount of money in creating a scientific, up-to-date system, well laid out, equipped with every constructional and mechanical advantage, and so  conceived as to be capable of development. and extension, if national emergency were ever to  render it necessary ?  In this latter contingency we must always bear in mind that in all probability the cost of the new site and the transport thither from Woolwich of good machinery,  plant and buildings, even of skilled foremen  and workpeople, would  be more than recouped by the sale of the valuable Woolwich land and of other material  left behind.  All this gives food for much thought.
    Another suggested solution and one advocated by labour, is that new work and branches of industryshall be sought out and obtained for the Arsenal, and that a minimum employment of 20,000 peopleshall be guaranteed.  If relations between management and labour can be  arranged, I entirely support this suggestion, but think that 15,000 should be the employment figure striven for.  But it may be asked what Board of Management is going to exercise itself and cast about for new schemes and work which,when introduced, will be subject to the influences and tenaciously held pledges and conditions existingthere, the effect of which is in large degree to make the productions of Woolwich two  or  three timesmore costly than those of other national factories.  Given a continuance of present  circumstances,such a solution is impossible.    It has been frequently urged by a member of the Committee that arrangements with Labour areimpracticable and will be broken at the moment when such breach would suit their convenience.  I donot believe so.  C.S.O.F. states in his evidence that agreements with Labour at Woolwich have beenloyally carried out; that even if the worst happened and faith were not kept, Woolwich would benefit,as old  pledges  and conditions would be cancelled and  could  not be revived.  If a further  safeguardwere necessary, the Ministry would be well advised to retain some of the best situated national factoriesas a duplicate system or form of understudy to which munition work could be transferred, did any vitaldifference between Management and Labour at Woolwich occur.    We  hear frequent criticisms regarding Arsenal management.  It is  indeed unsatisfactory;  but what chance  has management ever had at Woolwich, subject as it is to the House of Commons control,.and interfered with by political parties there ?  It carries  on an unequal contest with a rope round itsneck and under most cramped  circumstances.    I will venture to continue and conclude by reciting the last two pages of the Filling and S.A.A.Sub-Committee&apos;s report, changing the words &quot; Sub-Committee &quot; into the third person singular:     &quot; With the object of continuing as much work  at Woolwich as possible, and before any closing-down process takes place, it appears to the writer  that the present is a time when, with the acquiescenceof the labour  authorities at Woolwich, the whole question of the conditions  and prices of  labour peculiar to the Arsenal might be reviewed.    &quot;The  position may be briefly summarised  under three heads.   In the  first place a prospectivereduction in great degrees of the numbers employed at Woolwich is viewed with feelings of consternation,and the writer  understands that a deputation from  the Woolwich Local Advisory Committee, headed by their  Member of Parliament (the Right Hon. Will Crooks, M.P.), has  requested an  interview withthe Main Committee.    &quot; In the  second place labour conditions are more onerous at Woolwich than elsewhere, and pledges given in the past have a hampering effect, the result of which is largely to increase the cost of production,and it is in great degree owing to the above causes that the actual labour costs at Woolwich far exceed those in other national factories, being in most cases twice or three times as much; and,  finally, asthe Ministry  possesses in -other  localities many factories  all producing or capable of producing everyclass of munition now manufactured at Woolwich and in much greater quantity, it is to the advantageof the Ministry, and it is indeed almost incumbent upon them, failing any arrangement on the lines hereinsuggested, to transfer work elsewhere,  where it can be more cheaply and efficiently carried out.    &quot; The writer frankly says that  he associates himself with Labour&apos;s desire that as  much work aspossible should continue to be done at the Arsenal.  He has therefore the same object and goal in view,but at  the same time he cannot ignore the cumulative effects of conditions and pledges, which in theend are bound to render  manufacturing at Woolwich impossible from an economic point of view.  Hedisclaims any idea of an attempt to bargain with  Labour at Woolwich.  On the contrary, he seeks their assistance in a common object.    &quot; The writer accordingly, recommends that the  Ministry should arrange  a round-table conference -with the  Trade Unions concerned.  The object would be to obtain for the  Arsenal greater freedom and opportunity for the continuance of work there.  He acknowledges that, as  a Government factory, ratesof wages, hours and labour conditions in every branch  and department at Woolwich should be equalto the highest and best obtaining in such departments in the national factories in other words, thatWoolwich workers should  enjoy a kind of &apos; most favoured nation&apos; clause in the reward  for  and  sur-roundings of their labour.    &quot; There should be a corresponding obligation that Labour should extend to management at Woolwichexactly the same treatment, neither better  nor worse, than that which obtains between them in the generality of  factories throughout the United Kingdom.    &quot; The writer is confident that frank discussion with  Labour on the lines he has indicated will tendto bring about conditions for Woolwich which in the end will  be equally to the advantage of both the-.Management  and the workers in a common purpose.&quot;(Signed)  MARCHAMLEY.
FIRST  INTERIM  REPORT  ON  DANGER.&quot;THE RIGHT HONOURABLE WINSTON S. CHURCHILL, M.P., MINISTER OF MUNITIONS. SIR,-      The Woolwich Committee of Enquiry have considered in the first instance, as  a matter of special urgency, the question of the danger both to Woolwich and the surrounding area attendant upon filling operations and the storage of explosives and filled stores in the Arsenal, and have thought it well to submit an interim report on this particular question.      The committee feel that they can speak with no uncertain voice upon the question of danger.  In their judgment the present storage of explosives at Woolwich constitutes in  a high degree  a  real and grave source of public danger.      There are at the present time, in addition to the large amount being handled in the filling houses, over 10,000 tons  of explosives stored in  the  Woolwich  Arsenal enclosure.  This is contained in 254 magazines and storehouses,  concentrated in  an area  of 1,284 acres.      Details of the quantities of the various explosives are given in Appendix I.&apos; (i) Construction of Magazines, etc.,  and Danger Limits.      The magazines containing large quantities of raw cordite, i.e., 50 tons and upwards,  are mostly built of brick with light roofs of slate, corrugated iron or copper-sheathed wood, while those used for storing  high explosives  in the raw state are in process of being covered with bombproof protection of 15 feet  of earth.   These magazines both for cordite and H.E. are surrounded by earth mounds, and also in some cases by moats, there being 28 protected by mounds, 16 of which have moats in addition.  They are situated so far as possible in isolated  positions in the marshes, but the buildings which have been added from time to time have led to a serious reduction of the safety limits.  No less than 114 new buildings for storing explosives have been erected since the beginning of the war.      This mode of construction is, however, by no  means general, and very large quantities of high explosives and cordite, in the form of filled shells and cartridges, are stored in unprotected brick buildings with slate or corrugated iron roofs, notably in the shell stores known as Berber, which contain over 1,500 tons of H.E. and the old gunpowder magazines F. 6A and F. 6B containing some 600 tons of B.L. cordite cartridges.  (These two magazines have light concrete roofs.)   The light roof construction  has been- adopted for cordite magazines to give free upward escape to the gases in case of fire  and so  minimise the  risk of explosion ;  but when dealing with  quantities of between 200 and 300 tons stored in a  single magazine, there is no evidence that, in the event of fire  due to spontaneous combustion or other  cause, such a  vast quantity might not burn to  explosion.   Again,  the light roof is peculiarly susceptible to aerial attack, and from  the result of experiments carried out in 1913-1914 the Ordnance Board come to &quot; the  conclusion that if there is no obstacle to prevent the actual communication of ignition, cordite within   , a certain distance of the detonation of an H.E. bomb will be ignited and may explode violently; the Board were further of  opinion that if a magazine is so  constructed as to confine the result of burning cordite sufficiently, the rate of burning  will  be increased and may reach the critical point when explosion will occur.      Of the 172 buildings, each Containing over 1 ton of explosive, only 15 comply  with the regulations . issued by the Home Office  governing the distances which should be preserved between magazines and other danger buildings and between them and private dwellings.  The exclusion of Government factories from the Home Office  danger regulations calls for  special consideration.  Although  primarily  drawn up  for  the  guidance of private manufacturers  and others dealing with  explosives whose  precautions against fire may  not be so perfect as those obtaining in Government factories, it appears manifestly desirable that more attention should be paid to them in future.      While fully recognising that  in time of war  all considerations of risk  may be outweighed, there should  be a limit beyond which the safety of the public and Government employees ought not to be  endangered.   It should be  noted  that a  considerable part of the congestion dates back to the  period  before the war.      A  list of the magazines and storehouses considered to be the most dangerous has been prepared  and is available.  (ii)  Menace to River Embankment.      There are 30 magazines and  other buildings containing 3,562 tons  of explosives situated  within  100 yards of the river embankment, and in many cases considerably less, on a frontage of 2J miles. Should  a serious explosion occur in any one of these  there can be little doubt that a breach would be made in -the bank resulting in the flooding of the  marshes, which are some six to eight feet below high-water level,
and rendering useless all buildings  thereon, including several other munition works, in addition to the damage that would  inevitably be caused to the Arsenal itself and the crowded neighbourhood outsideby falling fragments  of shell, etc.(iii) Small Stores.    In the opinion of the committee a source of the gravest danger lies in the fact that there are scatteredabout inside the danger areas 112 small stores containing various quantities up to as much as 75 tons of high explosives and  propellants, many of which are separated from the sheds in which large numbersof workpeople are employed by only some three or four feet.   Sixty-nine of these buildings are entirelyunprotected by traverses or other adequate safeguards.    In particular attention is called to the five magazines in Q.F.C.F. 4, the stores in Q.F.C.F. 3, and stores Nos. 88, 89, 90,  17, 18, and 72.    The committee  attach the greatest importance to these small stores being protected by traversesof the most scientific nature that  can be devised.    Recently during a fire in a shed next to one of  the stores containing 15 tons of high explosives theflames blistered the paint on the store walls.  The committee would like to place it on record that insteadof the workers in the immediate locality quickly quitting it, they heroically entered the store and busiedthemselves with removing the heavy boxes of explosives lining  the walls into the centre of the shed.(iv) Safety Precautions as a whole.    There is no general supervision  of safety precautions applicable to the Arsenal.  The C.S.O.F.  dealswith safety precautions as regards the danger building regulations and transport of explosives within the.Arsenal, and in connection with the building of magazines, he is responsible that the site is so chosen asto fulfil ordinary safety precautions.  During the war, however, it has been found necessary on many occasions to relax the safety conditions.  But after buildings are completed, it rests with the department concerned to see that they are used  as originally intended, and it is here that there appears to be a  weaklink in the chain of responsibility.    The committee  consider that the C.S.O.F.&apos;s powers should be extended to enable him to deal withthe safety precautions of the whole Arsenal as he already deals with the major portion and has an expertstaff capable of doing this.(v) Opinion of Committee.    In view of the foregoing facts, the Committee consider that the conditions now existing at Woolwichdo constitute a very grave source of danger, and that action should be taken forthwith to protect  smallstores, and to reduce the enormous amount of explosives stored in a thickly populated area.  Even the disastrous explosions which have occurred at Silvertown, where some 50 tons of H.E. are understood to have detonated, at Morecambe and Chilwell, with their far-reaching effects, could hardly be comparedwith what might happen at Woolwich.    The risk taken is to a large extent unnecessary from the military point of view, and entirely unjustified-fiable in the  interest of the public  safety.   Evidence given by naval and  military authorities on thispoint agree that Woolwich might well be abandoned as far as the storage of filled ammunition is concerned,the only condition being that suitable accommodation must be found elsewhere.    The great growth of the filling factories since the war began has of necessity led to a corresponding increase in the amount  of raw explosives which have to be kept in readiness to feed them.  A limit ofthree weeks&apos; requirements has been laid down for this, and it is a question whether it could not now bereduced without imparing the requisite  output.    The Committee accordingly recommend :     (1) That all filled and made up ammunition, including shell, cartridges, Q.F., and S.A. ammunition,mines, bombs, warheads, fuzes, etc., should be removed from Woolwich immediately storage capacitycan be made available elsewhere, and that no accumulation of such munitions at Woolwich should infuture be permitted beyond one week&apos;s production.    This removal should be applicable in the first instance to&apos;:        (a) The filled  shell and mine  stores at Berber.       (6) The B.L. cartridge magazines, F. 6A, F. 6B, F. 55 and F. 56.       (c) The filled bomb store, F.  28D.       (d) The demolition store, F. 14.and would, if completely carried out, dispose of 5,274 tons.    (2) That all small stores containing explosives which are adjacent to sheds  in which workpeopleare employed, and which it is necessary to retain, should be protected  by traverses of the most scientificnature that can be devised, and the stocks kept to a minimum output and, if possible, introduced daily.Ttiis should apply particularly to  the five magazines in Q.F.C.F. 4, the stores in Q.F.C.F.  3, and storesNos. 88, 89, 90,&quot; 17,  18 and 72.    (3) That a substantial decrease should be made in the three weeks&apos; stock of raw explosives providedfor the filling factories by means of improved methods of transportation from the main source of supply..
