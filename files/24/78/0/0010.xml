       .         -                .  ffiE ci^soasmp.b---(circulated by the Home Secretary)     -^^V^eir meeting on the 3rd  April  (Minutes  553,(3)) the War Cabinet^^r^&amp;t^l^  to preside&apos; ever a Committee, cenpesed of representatives of. the       Departments osnoerned,  to decide  whether  the Censorship should be abolished       or continued.            The  Committee met  at the Home Office on Friday, 11th April, at 11 a.ra.       when the  following representatives of the Departments were presents-  Lord       William percent;&apos; and Lord  Arthur Browne (War Office),. Commodore Sinclair       (Admiralty&apos;), Kr.  Hurray (General  Post Office), *Jv Lockhart (Foreign Office);       Mr.&apos;&quot; Cfrimshaw (Board of  Trade), Hri Fuss  (Treasury),. kt* Brook (Ministry of       Food),(Mr. Chrystal (Ministry of  ^Construction) and Mr. Power (Irish       Office).            The&quot;Censorship;-though it derives  its authority from warrants issued       by the Secretary  of State for the Hone Department, is administered and       controlled by the military authorities.    It was established on the outbreak       of war for military purposes, and though  the Censorship has served a number       of valuable objects during the war which  are not strictly military, its       retention could not eusily bo justified  except on broad military grounds.            The  main reason -for abolishing the  Censorship as soon as possible is the.       formidable obstacle it  admittedly presents to our foreign trade, especially       at the present time when the revival of  business with foreign countries..is       so essential to industrial development  and financial stability.    There is       much complaint as to the delay of cables, and if the ordinary commercial       codes could again be used it is estimated that the cables would be relieved.       of about  one-fifth of their work.  It  should be remembered, however,- that       the censorship is at present the  only bar to Germans entering into the       markets of the world, and the longer their competition can He prevented the       better change British traders will have  of establishing themselves on a firm    \   basis,            Further, the abolition of the censorship would relieve the country bt       a considerable cost which amounts to about  800,000 a year,                                                                    *            The  principal reason for the continuance of the censorship is that it &apos;       is an essential part of the machinery of  the blockade.   The naval and       military  representatives urged this argument very strongly and it was       agreed by all present at the meeting that without the censorship the       blockade  could not be completely  effective.            Apart from the blockade the  censorship serve?  other useful objects to       which importance  is attached by the Departments.   For instance, a good deal       of - information is obtained which  has proved of valae to the Foreign Office
and to the L&amp;nistry of Food;   The intercepting of a great mass tfBolshevist literature is an excellent result of the oenser3hip especially frcra the Hone Office point of view.   The Treasury also finds in thethe dicoovery if offerees against the prohibition of remitting moneyabroad for investment.     The Committee, however, were agreed that apart from the blockadethe ether objects served by the censcrahip though undoubtedly valuablecould not be hold to justify its retention.     The conclusion to which the Committee name was that the censorship.should be abolished as soon as it is 0/0&apos;.:r thct the necessity to be   ^rrcy be required for blockade purposes.     If the Cabinet decide that this moment has not yet arrived,  theCommittee recommend in order to solve commercial difficulties to  someextent that the adoption of the system of telegraphic guarantees  bymeans of numbers which is already used in America should be expedited,censorship considerable -saistanoe in certain financial matters such asE.
