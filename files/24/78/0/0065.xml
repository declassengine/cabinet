In circulating this paper, I desire to acquaint my colleagues that a similar request for financial sanction for the despatch of Russian officers for service with anti-Bolshevikforces was made by the General Staff on the 20th December, 1918, and was refused bythe Treasury  on  the grounds  &quot;that  such  expenditure  is not  justified except in furtherance of a definite policy adopted by the War Cabinet.&quot;    It is for this reason that I now urge most strongly that the War Cabinet consider this question at an  early date, and take a  decision  which will  enable  the War Office,without further delay, to outfit and despatch Russian officers to the  parts of Russiawhere they are required.                                                WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.  29^ April, 1919.    Since the date of the signing of the Armistice it has become increasingly evidenton grounds of home and foreign policy, that an indefinite continuance of the occupationof parts of Northern Russia by Allied troops is neither desirable nor feasible, and thatan early opportunity for withdrawal must  be  sought for.   This  being  admitted, it  isincumbent on us to provide for those Russians who have remained loyal to and foughtfor the Allied cause in those regions.    There appear to be three possible  solutions :              1. Their abandonment to the vengeance of the Bolsheviks, which would         entail wholesale massacre of  our  supporters and permanent  dishonour of the         British name.            2. Their evacuation in   Allied  ships  and their establishment in  some       .  temporary home pending the restoration of a normal civilized  Government  in         Russia.   Should this course  be adopted,  the fact must be realized  that  in         addition  to the deplorable loss of prestige involved, the numbers to  be  dealt         with will be very large,  and the expenditure of money and shipping very         serious.   In addition, large enemy forces, estimated  at the  present time  at         45,000, would be released to join  the Bolsheviks on other fronts.             3. The  adoption  of  all  possible  measures to enable the  North Russian         Government  to hold  its own against the Bolsheviks.   Such  a course,  if         successful, would not  only save  the Allies  in general  and Great Britain  in         particular from the disgrace of  abandoning their friends to almost certain         death, but would offer the positive advantage of maintaining a Government         which is working for the restoration of order in Russia and for the destruction         of a power which is a danger to the peace of the world.    There can be  no doubt that the last named is  the policy which should be pursued,and if this is so, it is plain that the formation of an efficient Russian National Force isone of the first necessary steps to take in order to obtain success.    The  General  Officer Commanding-in-Chief at  Archangel  has more than onceemphasized in his  telegrams the fact that,  if this force is to be organized in time, it isessential to obtain Russian officers from some source and despatch them without  delay    (B19/213) 70 4/19 H&amp;S  7090wo\
to Archangel.  The General  Staff calculate that for this  purpose  it is necessary toprovide a body of 675 officers for the Archangel area besides 25 officers for the Murmanarea, making a total for North Russia of 700.     In Siberia also,  where  a successful prosecution of Admiral  Kolchak&apos;s plan of campaign would have direct effect on the military situation in North  Russia, the needfor good Russian officers is a primary necessity, and it  is considered that the despatchof 500 such officers to Vladivostock is desirable, in the first instance, with the possibility that later this number might be increased.     The officers required for North Russia and Siberia can,  it is believed, be obtainedfrom two sources; namely, from  amOng the Russian  officers refugees  in Allied  and neutral countries, and from among the Russian officers  ex-prisoners of war in Germany.     It is urged  most strongly, therefore,  that financial sanction may  be  given toundertake the task of obtaining the  required  officers from these different countries,collecting them in  the United Kingdom, and despatching them to their  destination inRussia.     In view of the financial straits  in  which these Russians find themselves at thepresent time it will be necessary :                                N     (a.) To provide them  with free transport,  1st class, to the United Kingdom  from           the country where they are now and from the United Kingdom to Archangel           or Vladivostock.     (6.) To feed them during the period from their departure for the United  Kingdom           until their arrival in Russia.  While in this country awaiting shipping, they           might well be  quartered and fed on the same scale as cadets, and the feeding           in this case would work out at approximately Si. a month per head.   One           month might be taken as the average length of time that they will be here,           and it is  proposed that during that  time they should be given as much           modern military training as possible.     (c.) To outfit them completely with British uniform and equipment for summer           and winter, underclothing  and necessaries.   The prisoners of war will most           certainly be  completely destitute of clothes.  A sum of about 70/. per head           must be allowed for this purpose.     (d.) To enable them  to provide themselves with  other articles and to meet small           current expenses.   For this purpose they should be given a weekly grant,           to be allowed for each week from date of departure for the United Kingdom           until date of arrival in Russia.  It is thought that 21.  10s. per week will be           a reasonable amount to grant per head.     An accurate estimate  of the  cost  of this scheme cannot  be  given,  as it dependspartly  on the time taken to collect  and equip the officers, but it will  probably notexceed 100/. an officer, or  120,000/. for the 1,200 required in  the first instance.
