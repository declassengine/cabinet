GOVERNMi^T), SECRET, 1.T.7194.\0-I JWAR CABINET.FOR&quot;&quot;TRY BILL.Memorandum by the President of the Board of Education,     When the Forestry Bill, prepared by Mr,, Acland on the invitation of the war Cabinet, was submitted to the HomeAffairs Committee it was criticised on the following grounds:-  (1)   The Bill indicated no Minister who should undertake     responsibility for.the new Forest Authority.  (2)   The powers vested in the hew Forest Authority were     too extensive.   In particular, criticism v;as directed     against the power given to the Authority to aid private     individuals by way of loan or grant (3(d)), and to the     power given to the Authority to subsidise Education and     Research at the Universities (3(g)).  (3)   The Bill was criticised for differentiating between     Ireland on the one hand, and Scotland and England on     the other.   In the case of Scotland and England it was     provided that the Forestry powers now vested in the     English and Scottish Boards of Agriculture might be     transferred by Order in Council at the end of two years     to the Forestry Commissioners *   No such provision was     inserted in the case of Ireland-   Further, while the     power vested in the Development Commission to assist     Forestry in Scotland and England was taken away, it was     to be continued in Ireland.  (4)   While there was general agreement that it was desirable     the constitute a Central Forest Authority vested with the     power of devising and financing Schemes of Forestry    ^Development, it was urged by the President of the Local     Government Board that it was unnecessary to create an     entirely new Authority for the purpose and that it would     be more convenient that the Central Forest Authority     should be a Branch of the Development Commission.       Of these arguments the most influential was undoubtedly the objection felt io the&apos; differential treatment of Irelandand to the position assigned to the English and ScottishBoards of Agriculture under the draft Bill. s  Mr. Acland has accordingly submitted a new draft, which provides foruniformity of treatment as between the two Countries, eliminatesthe procedure by Orders in Council to which objection wastaken, and empowers the Forest Commissioners to work throughthe Boards of Agriculture in Scotland and in England as wellas through the Department of Agriculture and TechnicalInstruction In Ireland.   The procedure adopted is analogous to that which was introduced into the Ministry of Health bill at the Report Stage with reference to the relations of theMinistry of Health and the Board of Education with respect tothe Medical Inspection and Treatment of school children,.       In view of the strength of the objection which was felt to the Forestry Bill in its&quot;original form In the Home AffairsCommittee it is, In my view, necessary that the ,;;&apos;ar cabinet should give a ruling upon the main points of principle which were involved.
