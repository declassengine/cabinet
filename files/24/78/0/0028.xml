PRIVATE  AND CONFIDENTIAL.      POLITICAL  INTELLIGENCE DEPARTMENT,          [APRIL 12, 1919.]        &quot;                     VOVSIQS OFFICE.pAST^X     (11151)                                               RUSSIA/023.10 Scol      IS          MEMORANDUM                             ON    THE  AIMS  AND  STRATEGY  OF BOLSHEVISM.    IN  view  of the fact that  the  Bolshevik Governments  both in Moscow  andBudapest are at present showing themselves anxious to come to terms with the AlliedGovernments in Paris, it may be opportune to set forth as briefly as possible the aims and strategy of Lenin&apos;s Government in Moscow in  so far as  it  is concerned with international politics.    Lenin is not only in the front rank  as a theorist on social and economic questions,but  has  proved  himself  a  first-class political strategist.   Before  the BolshevikRevolution in Russia he was  known as a man of commanding personality within  hisown  party, but be had had no opportunity of displaying his political  qualities on alarger stage.   His first opportunity was  the Peace of Brest-Litovsk, where, in spite ofenormous material disadvantages, and in the face of violent opposition from members ofhis own party, he carried through his policy of peace at any cost.   It  is from  the controversy  between  Lenin  and Trotski at  Brest-Litovsk and Lenin&apos;s  defence  ofhis position that we see  most clearly Lenin&apos;s strategy in international politics.    Lenins  avowed  aim is world  revolution brought about  by the Dictatorship ofthe  Proletariat,  and a world  federation  of Soviets controlled by the  proletariandictators  in each  country.    To  achieve  this end  he  will  resort to  any means,fair or foul, he  will change his tactics from week  to week, will make any promises thatsuit him at the moment, and will break them at the first opportunity.  He has weapons of offence and  defence which he uses with equal skill, so that when apparently on  the defensive he is in most cases preparing for a new offensive against the &quot; capitalist&quot;world,  In taking the  offensive, he relies  not so much  on his  military  weapon inwhich Trotski takes a childish delight as being his  own creation but  on propaganda and the undermining of credit and security in every country that  has not yet adoptedBolshevism as its official creed.  Lenirfs strategy is not of the dashing  kind that  heleaves  to Trotski it  is rather of the  painstaking order, ever on the alert  to profit  bythe mistakes of his opponents.  This is  essentially the nature of his propaganda.  the propaganda in itself, in so far as it is positive, is an endless  repetition of the same simpletheme &quot; All  power to the Soviets with the  temporary dictatorship  of the  proletariat,the complete socialisation of all human activities, and the union  of the proletariat ofevery country.&quot;  People may  smile at the theoretical  side of the  propaganda and  theexposition of the  complete communist  system.   That  in itself  may  not be a great danger, especially in countries where the labour movement  is sufficiently  advanced tohave a creed of its own.  But  the dangerous and, indeed, deadly side of the propaganda is its destructive aspect, the careful selection of everything that may tend to undermine the  credit of  all  non-communist Governments, and  the  sowing of suspicion against them in everything they do or say.     Side by side with the written propaganda there is a large band  of skilfully trainedagitators with unlimited sums  of money at  their disposal prepared  to  support  aaymovement, not necessarily Bolshevik in character, provided it can influence passionsand help to create that  revolutionary ferment  out of  which in due time Bolshevism iaall its nakedness may be bom.  It is more than likely that at  the  present moment in western Europe the agents  of Bolshevism are chiefly composed  of  those who   areoutwardly  violent critics of  Bolshevist theories, but  are  at the same time stronglysupporting Bolshevist policy according to instructions  from the Bolshevist headquarters in the Kremlin.     Jf propaganda in  all  its many forms  is the main weapon of offence  in breakingdown the resistance of his opponents, what then is his main weapon of  defence ?  It ison this question of defensive  policy that Lenin has on each occasion come into  conflict with other  members  of his party such as Trotski,  and it  is over  this question that he       [1130]-516
insists upon maintaining absolute control.  Questions of propaganda can be left prettyfreely to  his able lieutenants such as Badek, as they demand  little more  than greatdexterity of  intellect and unbounded  impudence, but it is Lenin and Lenin alone whoconducts the diplomacy of the Bolshevist Government on all vital questions.     The fundamental  principle of Lenin&apos;s diplomacy from Brest-Litovsk to the presentmoment has been self-defence.  And his chief weapon of self-defence has been peace inthe face of force  majeure.   Peace under protest was accepted  at Brest-Litovsk, and peace under  protest will be accepted to-day in Paris  or Moscow, the  protest of coursebeing made to the proletariat.of the world.   In order to secure  this peace to-day anyconditions will be  accepted and the more ruthless  they are the better for his propa-ganda provided the Soviet Government is left undisturbed, and the same &quot;respite&quot; is obtained  now from  the  Allies as was obtained from the Germans at Brest-Litovsk.Lenin&apos;s object  in  making such a peace is to use the &quot; respite&quot; to stir up  revolutionelsewhere.     The protests of the Bolsheviks, however, do not only take the form of denunciationsof the other side, who use their superior force to  impose conditions.  They  are alwaysaccompanied  by professions of faith clothed  in the language  of extreme  democracy.To all territorial questions the Bolshevist reply is  &quot; self-determination.&quot;  Trotski pro-claimed it at Brest-Litovsk, and nearly deceived Liberal opinion  in Western Europethat he meant  the same thing as they did; Bela Kun proclaims it to-day at Budapest.     Why then do the Bolsheviks raise the cry, &quot; Self-determination of peoples !&quot; whenit is notorious that they think not of peoples but only of one class in each country ?This formula was hotly disputed in the Bolshevist party in the days when Lenin worked in Switzerland.  It was Lenin who supported the formula, and with his  help it was accepted at the Zimmerwald Conference.     Lenin&apos;s  support of the  formula is  obvious.  To the Bolsheviks,  whose primary object is   to destroy  the  existing  State formations before constructing  their newcommunist society, self-determination  is an  ideal cry, while to the States themselves,which in their present form are the result of history, geography, and economics, whole-sale self-determination is manifestly impossible.   Once, therefore,  we try  to come to terms with Lenin on this basis it is  he who will appear as the upholder of minorities,while we shall be forced on to the defensive.   That is  what happened to Kuhlmann, andit is  the  same  thing, perhaps, that Bela Kun hopes will happen to the Allies if theyattempt to negotiate with him.  The Bolsheviks  speak a different language from the democracies of Europe and America, and any arrangement  we make with them will beregarded  by  them  as,  in Zinoviev&apos;s words, &quot;a scrap  of paper&quot;  (&quot;bumazhka&quot;).   Theyare prepared to meet any argument save that of force.     Lenin s overwhelming desire for peace is due to the fact that he knows it is peacealone that can  save him.  it is  maintained  by those  who urge a policy of compromisewith  Lenin that military opposition to  the  Soviet  Government only strengthens its position, while the conclusion of peace weakens it.   Such people believe that the present policy of Allied intervention has thrown the masses  on to the side of the   Bolsheviks,and that  if the Allies concluded  peace  and withdrew their forces  the  Soviet Govern-ment would  automatically abandon the  &quot; terror&quot;  and  develop along  more moderatelines     People who so argue not only ignore the fundamental tenets of the Bolshevist creed,which rejects the idea  of democracy and representative institutions, but refuse to acceptthe fact that Bolshevism remains  in  power  to-day in Russia not through moral butphysical force.*   If the latter were removed Lenin would be overthrown, and no matter what assurances he may give  he will not adopt democratic methods  and freely acceptthe will of the majority.   Bolshevism cannot compromise with Democracy any morethan Democracy can compromise with Bolshevism.  The  difference between  Democracyand Bolshevism is as great as between Democracy and  Kaiserism.  Lenin knows that by compromising with Democracy he would  destroy his  own  system, and that he will never do,  in spite of professions to the contrary.    It is not the presence of Allied troops that makes Bolshevism so extreme ; it is the bolshevist system itself.   The withdrawal of our troops would  not change the system ;it would merely strengthen the hands of those who control it.  If this were not so,Lenin, who.has worked all his life for the ideas he has now put into practice, would notadopt a policy that was likely  to end in the defeat of those ideas.  The fact  that Lenindesires peace is the best argument against its desirability for us.    Another reason why Lenin is now seeking peace and recognition of his Governmentis his knowledge that such a step on our  part would  enormously increase the prestige    *  This is proved by the recent rising of the working classes ia Petrograd and the way; it was suppressedby force.
of Bolshevism  in  Europe.   This is very often overlooked by those who favour theconclusion of peace with Lenin, but  to Lenin it is a point of primary importance.   The&quot; Severnaya Kommuna &quot; (&quot; Northern Commune &quot;) of  the 23rd  March, 1919, writes asfollows:  &quot; Even if  all propaganda and  agitation in  other countries were  stopped,nevertheless the proletariat of the whole world would  be  sufficiently inspired by the bare fact of the power of the Soviet and the dictatorship of the poor and by the veryfact of its recognition by the world victors.   There is  no doubt that a new peace now with the victors could not last long.  It would be broken by a world  revolution inwhich the Imperialists would be defeated.&quot;
