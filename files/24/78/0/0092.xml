In forwarding the attached communication from the Secretary of the Imperial war graves Commission, dated 17th April, 1919, I  must draw the attention of the WarCabinet to the fact that demands for personnel of the same type as that required  forwork in  connection with  the graves  in  France and Belgium have  been  very great.During the period since the Armistice, not only  has the Army had to provide  a largenumber of personnel for employment directly connected with demobilization, but even with the prospect of a great proportion of these men becoming available, owing  to the gradual diminution  in the rate of demobilization, I am still faced with the problem offurnishing large numbers of elderly and comparatively low category men for such duties as the care  of horses with  cavalry regiments, guards over stores awaiting disposal,skilled men of various types  for work  in connection with engineer and  ordnanceservices for clearing up and disposal of stores.    In providing these men I am limited by  the necessity of drawing  from thosesources only which will not interfere  with the recruiting  of fit men under 37 years ofage,  and for  this reason  I am now opening enlistment for  work  in connection withgraves, and the other duties I have referred to above, to fit men over 37 years of age.It will be realized, therefore, that,  in the present  circumstances, the provision  of themen in question is a matter of exceptional difficulty.                                             WINSTON S.  CHURCHILL.    5th May,  1919.                      IMPERIAL WAR GRAVES COMMISSION.                                            Winchester House,                                                  St. James&apos;s Square,                                                           London, S.W. 1,                                                                 17th April, 1919.    Sir,        I am directed by the Imperial War Graves Commission to bring to the notice of the    War Cabinet certain facts relating to the progress of the work of putting  in order the    War cemeteries in France and Belgium, and, as a part of this work, the exhuming and*   bringing into cemeteries of the bodies buried in isolated graves.                ,        It was always foreseen that the period of demobilization would afford an excellent    opportunity of obtaining the large amount of military labour necessary for this purpose,    and at one of their meetings, shortly after the cessation of hostilities, great  concern was    expressed as to the slowness with which the work of putting the graves and cemeteries    into order in France was being carried out, and, subsequently, the Commission  decided    themselves to make representations to the Army Council on the matter.  Copies of the    Commissions letter and of the reply from the Army Council are attached hereto.        Serious delay has, however, occurred in this matter and the opportunity of obtaining    military labour in France, of which there has been presumably a plentiful supply available    during the last few months, has  been allowed to pass, and even the small number of men    required to  tidy up the cemeteries, so that they may be fit for relatives to visit, have not        (B19/224) 70 5/19 H&amp;S  7118wo
been furnished.  The authorities have therefore apparently been brought to the conclusionthat the labour  required must  be obtained from military personnel in this country.   In,spite, however, of the assurance given in the  last paragraph of the Army Council letterof the 15th instant, the Commission understand from the War Office that it will be verydifficult, if not impossible, to obtain all the necessary military labour from this countryunless priority is given to the work on the cemeteries for which the men are  required.     The Commission feel strongly that there is no work  at  the present time which hasa more insistant claim on the attention  of the Government than that  of putting intoproper order the last resting places of those who have died  for their country, and iheyconsider that no time should now be lost in  giving such instructions as will ensure theimmediate carrying out  of  the work and  put an  end to  the very regrettable delayswhich have marked the treatment of this question in the past.     The Commission desire, with the utmost seriousness, to impress  upon the Govern-ment the  importance of prompt and vigorous action  being taken.   Now that  thefighting is over, the thoughts of countless people in this country turn anxiously to thesacred  places where  their  dead  he buried, and there  is  a very natural desire  to  be assured that the graves are  being  carefully kept  and  tended.  Moreover, the time will soon be coming when the relatives must be  allowed to visit the cemeteries in Franceand Belgium, and if they were to find the graves in an untidy and neglected condition,in which,  it is to be feared,  many of them are at present, there would undoubtedly be avery serious outcry and it would be felt  that the  good name of the country had  beenvitally injured.     If such a scandal is to be avoided, it is clear that the personnel needed for work onthe  cemeteries  must be provided  at  once, and  the  Commission  trust that the  WarCabinet will take the necessary steps to ensure that the additional military labour requiredfor putting the cemeteries in order and  completing  rapidly the work  of exhumation of bodies buried in isolated  graves, where this is essential, is immediately forthcoming.     The Commission are not competent, and would indeed exceed their authority, werethey  to attempt to formulate an  opinion  as  to whether  the failure of the militaryauthorities to deal adequately with this vital work during  the  period referred to was due to negligence or insuperable difficulties ; they have, however, been most  unfavourablyimpressed  by the strong  statements  made  by  Domiuion representatives on  theCommission  as  to  the inability of General Headquarters, Fiance,  to  take promptadvantage of the offers of considerable numbers of men, for  this work, made by the commanders of Dominion Forces in  France.  At  the same time the Commission feel it their duty to place on  record their deep appreciation of the unceasing sympathy andenergy with  which both the present Adjutant-General, War Office, and his predecessor,have pressed the claims of the last resting places of the Empire&apos;s dead on the attentionof the military authorities in all theatres of war.                                   I am, Sir,                                        Your obedient Servant,                                                 J. E. TALBOT,                                                   Principal Assistant Secretary.    THE SECRETARY,           WAR CABINET.                                        Winchester House,                                               St. James&apos;s Square,                                                       London, S.W. 1,                                                            21st February, 1919.Sir,     I  am  directed to  inform you that  at  its  meeting on 21st January. 1919,  theImperial War Graves Commission expressed considerable anxiety as to the  slownesswith which the work  of putting graves and cemeteries into order in France was  beingcarried out.  I  attach  a copy of an extract from  the  minutes of that meeting fromwhich  it will be seen that the  Secretary of State, who presided, undertook, inasmuch as the  responsibility lay not with the Directorate of Graves Registration and Enquiries,but  with the fighting  forces  in  the field,  to bring the matter  directly  before  theCommander-in-Chief, France.
     The Commission are informed that a letter was accordingly  despatched  by theArmy Council  to  the Commander-in-Chief, France,  on 28th January. 1919, but  theylearned with regret at their meeting on  18th February, 1919, that no satisfactory replyto that letter could be laid before them, and greatly fearing that military labour  maynot be available to complete the work of exhumation and  concentration  of isolatedbodies and the restoration of  cemeteries before the Armies are demobilized, felt  boundto make some stronger representation by passing the following resolution :          &quot; That, the Commission not having received a satisfactory account  of progress     in the work of exhumation and concentration of bodies in isolated graves and the   *  putting of cemeteries into order in France and Belgium, the Secretary be instructed     to write to the Secretary,  War Office, stating that unless the Commission receive     an assurance.within  the next  3 weeks that the work  is being carried out  in  a     satisfactory and expeditious  manner, the Commission will  have no option  but to     lay the matter before the War  Cabinet.&quot;     The present situation in France and Belgium,  as the  Commission are informedfrom various sources, is that while the work has begun and is progressing slowly in the fifth Army area, little or nothing has been done in the Third and  First Army areas ;that volunteers have  long been available, but are unable to commence work owing toinsufficiency of transport.     The  Commission  greatly  apprehend  that this  urgent   work  of exhumation,concentration and restoration which should have been started many weeks ago, so that full advantage might be taken of  military labour in France whilst it was still available,will  be left uncompleted, and that cemeteries will  be handed over to them in  thisincomplete state, and that they will then be unable to find the necessary labour     I am therefore to request that the Army Council will give such instructions as will ensure immediate  improvement in  this state of affairs, which  the  Commission under-.stand is attributed primarily  to insufficiency of transport.                                 I am, Sir,  ,                                      Your obedient Servant,                                             (Signed)     J.  E. TALBOT,                                                  Principal Assistant Secretary.   THE  SECRKTARY,         WAR OFFICE, S.W. 1.     EXTRACT FROM MINUTES OF IMPERIAL WAR GRAVES COMMISSION MEETING,                               21ST  JANUARY, 1919.     Sir Thomas Mackenzie said  he  wished to bring to the notice of the commission the slowness with which the work  of putting the graves and cemeteries into order inFrance was being done.  He was informed by military men that unless more vigorousmeasures were taken, many of the graves would not be able to be traced at all.     General Ware  said that any delay  that had occurred in  putting the &quot;cemeteriesinto order was due  to scarcity  of  labour.   The  work could not  be  expedited unless some additional labour were  supplied.   The question had been  raised whether  thegraves work should  have the first call on the labour available.     The Chairman said that he could not go so far as that.   The bringing of men backon  demobilization imposed  a great strain  on our transport, and  there were serious difficulties about the whole  matter.   In view, however, of what Sir Thomas Mackenziehad said, he would have an enquiry  made ; the Army in the field should be asked whatthey could do to accelerate this solemn and vital work.     General Macready said that  in  his time in  France the work had been hindered bythe difficulty in obtaining Treasury sanction for the necessary personnel.     Mr. Box suggested that if there was difficulty in obtaining British military labour,units from the Dominion forces might  be  utilized  for the work  of  clearing the ground and putting cemeteries into order.  He  was sure that the Australian Army  couldsupply labour for this purpose immediately.
     The Chairman said that  it would be  a  good thing if a lettei? were drafted whichcould be sent out from the War Office to the Armies in the field asking what further help they could give at this juncture both in regard to  photographs and work on thegraves.     Sir George Perley said it was really  a.very urgent question.  There was nothing which  would cause more trouble all  over the Empire than the knowledge that there &apos;was avoidable delay in this matter and that in consequence the identification  of graveswas jeopardized.    The Chairman promised  that if the letter  he&apos; suggested were prepared he would put it forward.                                                War Office,                                                      London, S.W.,Sir,                                                           15th April, 1919.    With reference  to your  letter of 21st February, 1919, I am  commanded by theArmy Council to inform you  that  they regret the progress  in the work in France andBelgium has not been as satisfactory as was hoped.    Among the chief reasons for the delay have been the  absence, through  seriousillness, of several senior officers, the bad weather conditions  during the winter, and theshortage of staff owing to demobilization.    The question was considered at a Conference held on 19th  March, 1919, at whichthe Secretary of State for War  and the Field-Marshal   Commanding-in-Chief werepresent, when it was decided that the necessary labour required  for the work in france should be obtained from personnel available in this country.    Immediate  steps have been taken to obtain this labour,  which will be sent toFrance as quickly as possible, when it is hoped that  satisfactory progress towards thecompletion of the work will be made.                               I have the honour to be,                                        Sir,                                           Your obedient Servant,                                                (Signed)    J. J. CORCORAN.THE SECRETARY,    IMPERIAL WAH GRAVES COMMISSION,         WINCHESTER HOUSE,             ST,. JAMES&apos;S SQUARE,                   LONDON, S.W. 1.
  w pi i b3rd May,  1,9.19.NOTE BY MR. LONG.       I forward herewith a Memorandum on the proposal of the Minister of Supply that hie Department shall takeover from the Board of Admiralty the responsibility forthe supply of the Stores and Equipment of the Navy.       I think it right to say that my colleagues on theBoard of Admiralty consider these far reaching proposals to &quot;be of the utmost gravity and that they are. unanimouslyof opinion that their adopt inn would make it impossiblefor the Board to exercise their constitutional responsibilityfor the efficiency of the Navy.
