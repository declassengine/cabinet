UNEMPLOYMENT      The number of out of work^dona^ion^polJ^ies-vjLo^geoT^incpeaa--&apos;-ed from 1,060*245 to 1,077,386, l.e. by 1.64$ during the weekending April 4th.   During the previous week the increase was.67y?.   The unemployment figures are at present of a somewhatfluctuating character owing to policy-holders working alter-nate weeks under short-time schemes.   For example the 10,000women who lodged policies last week at Dundee are this week al-most all at work,.   The increase in the number of applicants for employment on the registers of the Employment Exchanges was2.80;&apos;a during the week ending April 4th as compared with 2,89;sduring, the previous woek.      Appendix I gives the distribution of unemployment at suc-sucessive dates as between civilian men, women, boys and girlsand H.M. Forces.   The increase in the number of policies lodg-ed by demobilised members of the Forces, while somewhat lessthan last week is still very considerable.      Appendix 2 gives an analysis of policies lodged by Indus-tries.   Unemployment shows a  further increase throughout thoUninsured Industries,    (The fall in Textiles -  other  thanCotton and Woollen is apparent rather than real  and  is occa-sioned by the fluctuations of  the short time system,)   In the insured industries a general reduction is noted, the only con-siderable exception being in Iron and Steel Production, forwhich the number of policies lodged Is increasing  at a rapid rate.      The rapid  increase  in the number classified under Domes -tic Offices and  Services  is occasioned to a considerable extent by reclassifioation of workers in ammunition trades.   The lasttwo weeks have shown a considerable increase in  the  placings of domestic Servants by the Exchanges.      The North  .estern division now shows considerably moreunemployment than any other division, 427.5 out  of  every 10,000of the total (sugar-buying) population being in  receipt of outof work donation.1^ 4.19                                 A.
