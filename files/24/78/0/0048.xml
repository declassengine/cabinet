This Document is  the Property OFHis  BRITANNIC  Majesty&apos;s Government,SECRET.MINISTRY   OF   FOOD.OR  FORTNIGHT ENDING  WEDNESDAY, APRIL 23,  1919.PART  J.-ACTION  TAKEN.     The &quot;following is a summary of the report prepared by the Committee appointedto consider the incidence and administration of the bread subsidy :      In  the late summer of 191.7  the  Government  decided  that the quartern loafshould be sold at the uniform rate of  ninepence  and effect was given to this decision by means of a subsidy on flour.  The  Government also decided that subsidised flourshould  be  supplied  for the  manufacture of flour  confectionery.   All  flour  was accordingly sold at a uniform wholesale price, whether it was  intended for bread-making or for other uses, but with a view to restricting the benefit  of the subsidy,a list of  precluded  purposes  was drawn  up,  e.g.,  wholesale  biscuit-making  andindustrial  uses,  and persons  were forbidden  to take  delivery of  flour for thesescheduled purposes, except under a licence and  on payment of  a duty on the Hourauthorised.     The present  rate of disbursement in respect of the subsidy is 50,000,000Z.  perannum and the Committee is agreed that  no substantial reduction is possible in  theimmediate  future without  either  (1) a  general  increase  in  the price of flour andconsequently of bread or (2) an increase in the price  of flour used for other purposesthan bread-making.  The first course is  regarded  as impracticable and the second would probably rouse strong opposition in the country.     The machinery of the present subsidy was hastily devised  to meet an emergency,but on the  whole it has worked admirably as a war measure.   In view of  the  alteredcircumstances, however, the system  is open  to serious  objection on the followingpoints :      (a)  The  elimination of competition  among  millers  brought about by control is           essentially uneconomic.     (6)  Apart from  the precluded purposes, every use of flour, e.g., for  cakes and           buns, is subsidised.  Out  of  the total subsidy of 50,000,000L per annum,           14,500,0001 is attributable to purposes other than bread-making.     (c)  The licence duty on precluded purposes is not satisfactory in operation. It is,           in some  respects,  difficult of collection ; its incidence results in serious           hardship  ; and where flour is obtained without a licence, proceedings can           be taken  for infringements of the  Order, but it would require an Act of           Parliament to enable the Ministry to recover the licence duty.     The only considerable improvement that can be  made if  the present system is retained, is the abolition of  the licence duty except in the cases of the export of flourand possibly flour products  and the supply of flour for ships&apos;  stores.  The retentionof the licence duty in this limited sphere presents no administrative difficulties.  Insupport of this course the following considerations were submitted :      (a)  The duty is unfair in its incidence in the home  market.  A wholesale manu-           facturer of biscuits,  such as Messrs. Huntley and  Palmer, pays in all           80s. 3d. per sack for flour  and has to compete in the home market with a           manufacturer selling retail, such as J. Lyons &amp; Co., who pays only 44s. 3d,,           per sack.     (6)  After the  abolition of the licence  duty in the home  market,  the use of           subsidised flour for industrial purposes, except under the authority of  the           Ministry,  can still be prevented by the Wheat, Rye and  Rice Restriction           Order.     (c)  The  loss of  duty  resulting from the abolition of the licence in the home           market would not exceed 125,0001. per month.     The Committee  considered the following alternative systems :   (a)  The Modification of the existing  control of the  Milling Industry.-Under         this proposal all wheat would be sold at a price calculated to allow theA (33)7792-3 Pk 16  150 4/19 E&amp;S                                         1
            sale of bread at not more than ninepence a quartern loaf.   The present&apos;            control of the  milling  industry would  be removed and the Flour and            Bread Prices Orders withdrawn.   The  Committee is of opinion that this            system would set  free competitive forces which would  tend to reduce            the price of flour and bread, but as a safeguard the power of re-imposing            maximum  retail prices might be retained.  As  six  months&apos; notice  of            de-control must be given to the flour millers, this  proposal cannot be            put into force at present.      (J))  Restriction of the Subsidy-TJnder  this  scheme  flour  would be sold  to            bakers and retailers at  a flat rate covering the cost, and the subsidy            would be restricted to (1) a  rebate  to bakers on flour used in bread-            making and (2)  an. allowance to housewives who bake bread at home.            This scheme would restrict the subsidy to flour used for bread-making            and  reduce  it by two-sevenths,  i.e.,  by  1,200,0001 per month.  It            would however involve the establishment of decentralised accounting            machinery, the registration of home bakers with flour retailers and  the            increase of the normal  retail price of  flour from  2s. Sd. to 3s. lOd.            per stone.    The Food Council has considered  the report of the Committee and agreed to thefollowing proposals :-    (1)  That the present system, with the continued collection of duty on ships&apos; stores           and on the export of  flour and any scheduled flour  products, but with the           abolition of the licence duty in the  home market, be maintained until the           autumn ; and that the consent of H.M. Treasury to  the proposed  change           be  obtained.    (2) That the Royal Commission on Wheat Supplies be requested to examine the           scheme for the modification of the existing control of the milling industry ;           to consult the milling and baking industries on the  matter,  so far as  this           was thought to be proper and desirable; and to report its  conclusion, to           the Food Council.    (3) That the objections to the introduction of the  alternative scheme under which           the subsidy would be restricted to flour used for bread-making outweighed           any possible advantages.    Food Council, The Council met on April  10th, 15th, and 16th.    The  report of  the Travelling Commission of  Enquiry  into the  cost  of  theproduction of  milk was considered  and the scale of  maximum prices  recommendedby  the  Commission was  adopted.   This scale,  which  covers the months  May  to september, was given in the Report for the week ended Wednesday, April 9th.  Thecorresponding retail prices are as follows :                   May and June    -    -    -    -  Id. a quart.                  July and August -    -    -    -  8d. a quart.                  September.....9d. a quart.    It was agreed that home cheese should be  decontrolled not later than June 30th.    It was reported that the sanction of H.M.  Treasury for the purchase of Canadiancheese was still withheld and  the  Council agreed that  as this purchase  is the  onlycertain means of ensuring  supplies and as the failure to buy now may  at a later daterender competitive buying necessary, ELM. Treasury should be pressed to give their consent to the transaction.    A memorandum on the supplies of  grain  for Europe was  considered  and it wasdecided  that,  subject  to  the  concurrence  of H.M.  Treasury and  the Ministry ofShipping, 50,000 tons of cereals due to arrive in the United  Kingdom during May,should be diverted to continental ports.  The  Council also discussed the  findings ofthe Bread Subsidy Committee, which are dealt with  in another  part of this Report.    The subject of speculation in fruit was considered and it was agreed1        (1) that it was undesirable to maintain the control of fruit  during  the coming             season ;       (2) that the maximum prices for jam  should  be retained,  and lowered if.             necessary ;       (3) that a press notice calling further,  attention  to the  risks of  speculation in             fruit should be issued.
DECONTROL OF OILS AND FATS.     The  following statement shows  the steps  taken to release oils  and fats from control:      (1) Bones. --The chief object of  the control of  bones was  to  conserve the fats extracted therefrom for glycerine purposes, only a small quantity of  bone grease being of an edible nature.  The system of control consisted of the imposition of a maximum price for bones, whether fresh butcher bones or streeter bones, the  licensing of bone degreasers, and the requisitioning of  the resultant products.  The  Licensing of Bone Degreasers Order and the Requisition Order were revoked on January 24th and  the Maximum Prices Order will be withdrawn as from April 30th.     (2) Home-melt Tallow and Greases. The object of  this control was the conserva- tion of home-melt tallows for national uses, the edible tallow  being  know as dripping. The system of control included a maximum price for raw fats, the licensing of  tallow melters, the requisitioning of the products, and a maximum price for home-melt tallows and greases, with a standard of  quality for dripping sold for human consumption. The Orders  relating to the licensing  of  tallow melters and  the  requisitioning of products  were  revoked on &quot;January  24th.  The maximum  prices for raw fats  are still in force, but they have become inoperative as the current prices are  much below the maxima.   The  maximum prices order for dripping and  home-melt tallows will be revoked as from 30th April, but a new  order providing for a minimum standard of quality in dripping sold for human consumption will be inti produced.     (3)&apos; Seeds, Nuts and Kernels, Oils and Fats.--Control  of these commodities was introduced with a view to conserving  supplies of seeds, nuts and kernels, and oils and fats for the manufacture, of glycerine and purposes of food.   The system adopted was as follows :      (a) The  requisitioning  of all imported  seeds,  nuts,  kernels, oils  and fats  on           arrival  in the United Kingdom ;     (b) The requisitioning of the products of crude and refined oils at the crushing-           mills and refineries.     Seeds, nuts  and  kernels on  arrival in the United Kingdom were directed to the crushing mills ; such crude oils  and  fats,  whether  imported or home-produced, as were required for food purposes were  directed to the refineries, and  those required for technical purposes were directed to the  appropriate  technical use.  Refined oils, whether imported  or home-produced, were sent to the manufacturers of margarine compound and other products.     The steps taken in the matter of  decontrol are as follows :      Notices have been  issued from time to time advising importers  that particular Requisition Orders would not apply to goods shipped after certain dates      (a) As to imported animal fats, all shipments made after January 28th, 1919 ;     (b) As to palm oil, all shipments  made after March 11th,  1919 ;     (c) As to all other  seeds, nuts, kernels, oils and fats (except castor seed, ground           nuts, linseed and  palm kernels which  were released after March 18th),           all shipments made after March 15th.     Arrangements were subsequently made with the crushers  and refiners to take- over Government  commitments  as  from March  29th;  from the  same  date  the requisition orders in respect of the output of  the factories were not  put into effect.     The  various requisition  orders  will be finally withdrawn as from  April 30th, except that the Order under which crude oils are requisitioned will be retained so that the Ministry of Food  may be in a position to deal with any  shortage of  crude oils that may be experienced by the manufacturers of margarine.     (4) Margarine. The control of  margarine involved the allocation of supplies of requisitioned raw materials to licensed manufacturers, the establishment of a system of distribution with the licensing of wholesale and retail dealers, and the maintenance of maximum prices.     The  steps taken  towards decontrol are as follows :      As from March 2nd, the licensing of  wholesalers and the control of  distribution ceased, and  a new Maximum Prices Order was introduced.  During the month of March the margarine manufacturers  continued to manufacture under the Government formula and purchase their raw materials from the Government.    As  from April 1st, however, manufacturers were  allowed  to manufacture  in accordance with their own
4iformulae under licence  from the Ministry of Food, but  they are  required to submitweekly samples of their products to the technical  experts of the department.  the manufacturers have also purchased and taken over the Government commitments for animal fats and refined  oils suitable for manufacture into margarine.     (5) Compound  Lard. The system  of  control established in the matter of  com-pound lard was similar  to that set up in the case of margarine.  As from February 15ththe control of distribution was  removed  under  a Maximum  Prices Order, but raanu-facturers have  continued to carry on their  businesses under licence from the Ministryof Food ;  there are no restrictions as to the purchase of raw  materials, but a  sample of the product has to be submitted each week for examination.     (6) Edible Oils. During  the war only small  quantities  of edible oils  were available for distribution to the public, and part  of the supply was reserved for  Jews on religious grounds.   In February, 1919,  supplies became  available  for the general* public, and the oils  were released from all  control except a Maximum Prices Order.     Generally the  position in  regards to  seeds, nuts  and kernels, oils and fats, on April 30th, will be the  removal of all control except in the following respects :      (a) The retention  of maximum prices for  copra, cotton seed,  ground  nuts and            palm kernels and the resultant  crude and refined  oils and for margarine,            compound lard,  vegetable butter and shredded suet;     (b) The maintenance of a  standard of quality for margarine, compound lard, and            vegetable butter by means of the Oils  and Fats Compound (Licensing of            Manufacturers)  Order, 11)18; and for compound  lard,  vegetable butter,            shredded suet and  dripping by meaus  of the  special  conditions  as  to            quality fixed in the various Orders ;     (c) The restriction of the use of the principal edible oils to human consumption ;     (d) The reservation of power to requisition crude oils in case of necessity.                            SUPPLIES AND DISTRIBUTION.     Meat.-The retail  price  of meat  will be reduced  by 2d.  per pound as from May 5th, but  in view of the increase in the sale of meat  since the date when the retailers&apos; margin of profit was  fixed, the reduction in the wholesale price  will be restricted to .1 fa. per pound.     Bacon. Owing to the  shortage of best bacon, Canadian  bacon is  being sold wholesale in London at 10s. per owt.  above the maximum for English and Irish bacon.. This encroaches to some extent upon the retailers&apos; margin of profit.     Tea.  Public auctions will be resumed in May and  it has been  decided that during the first month  30,000,000 lbs. of tea will be offered for sale.   There has been a considerable fall in prices in the export sales, and as this  market is nearly normal, it may be possible in June to combine in  one auction the sales for home consumption and for export.     Dried Fruits. The dried fruits reaching  this country are no longer distributed by the Ministry of  Food, but  the Dried Fruits  (Retail Prices)  Order,  1918, will  be maintained until September 1st.     Jam. The control of the  distribution of jam ceased  on April 1.6th, and from that date, jam may be purchased from any retailer without any nominal restriction as to quantity.  The maximum retail  prices, however, will remain in force.      Reports from Divisional Food Commissioners. In several districts fish is  being- sold at prices considerably above the recent maximum controlled prices and strong- complaints have been received.  Demands are being made  for the withdrawal of the restriction on  the sale of new bread and it is reported that magistrates have refused to convict bakers for infringements of the Order.                 ORDERS UNDER  DEFENCE OF THE REALM  REGULATIONS.      An  authorisation  dated 8th April 1919,  under the Oils, Oil  Cakes and  Meals  [Requisition)  Order 1917, and  the  Cattle Feeding Stuffs  (Requisition) and (Maximum Prices) Orders 1918, releases  cattle feeding-stuffs from  control under these  Orders with the exception of certain kinds of linseed cake and cotton-seed cake.
    A general licence dated 12th  April  1919, under the Cream Order, 1918, releasescream on and after .12th April from the restrictions imposed.    An Order dated  12th  April  1919,  revokes  the Food Control Committees (MilkRequisition) Order, 1917, as amended.    Order  dated  l&amp;th  April 1919,  amending the Live Stock (Sales)  Order,  1918,provides that where an in-calf cow or heifer has been sold for slaughter, a certain sumshall be deducted from the  price to cover the butcher&apos;s loss.    A general licence dated 16th April 1919;  under  the Jam (Prohibition of Export)Order, 1919, allows the consignment of marmalade from Great Britain to Ireland.                            ENFORCEMENT OF  ORDERS.    The total number  of  prosecutions  during the  fortnight ended April 19th was534, of which 504 were successful.  A farmer at Weston and Parkgate was fined 800Z.with 601. costs on sixteen charges.             PART  II.-SUMMARY OF THE FOOD  POSITION.                                  -  IMPORTS.    The total imports of the principal foods and feeding-stuffs, which had been about120,000 tons for a number  of weeks, rose in  the week ended 12th April to 153,400tons, and in the week  ended 19th April  to 156,900 tons, the highest point reachedsince the beginning of February.  These quantities are above the average  of  the first16 weeks of the calendar year (146,700 tons), but are still below the wreeklj average of thecurrent cereal year to date (164,800 tons).  The increase was  common to all the chiefgroups.  Imports of wheat, which in the week ended 5th April were 14,000 tons, rose inthe following week to 39,400 tons, and in the  week ended 19th April to 61,800 tons,while total cereals  rose in the same  weeks from 55,300 tons  to 65,500 tons and then to 89,100 tons ; in  the case  of meat the corresponding increase was from 7,100 tons to 13,500 tons  and further to 19,800 tons, and in that of bacon, a slight decrease of200 tons to 6,300 tons in the week ended  12th  April was followed by a rise to 15,700tons in  the next week, while the  average arrivals of sugar in the two weeks (36,900tons) fully maintained the high level of  the preceding three weeks.   As  regards theaverage quantities of other commodities received in these two weeks, butter continuedto arrive in relatively large quantities (3,500 tons), while cheese (1,300 tons) and lard(1,100 tons) made a welcome reappearance.  Arrivals of condensed milk (2,200 tons)remained  large, as did also  those of  coffee (3,200 tons), but the quantities of tea andcocoa  fell  below the  level of  the present year, though  they still compare favourably with the pre-war average.    The figures for  the first 33 weeks of  the cereal years  1917-18 and 1918-19 arecompared in the following table : Total Imports for the first 33 weeks of Cereal Year (Mh September to 19fc7i April). 	1918-19.

                                    STOCKS.    Total stocks of meat and provisions in cold stores and importers&apos; warehouses in theUnited  Kingdom on  April  12th showed  generally little change on those of a weekbefore.   The most notable exception was a fall of  6,600 tons in the stocks of bacon,reducing  total  stocks to 34,900  tons,  and a  fall of 2,500 tons in lard was  alsoappreciable.  Against this was  to be set an increase of  2,000  tons in the stocks of butter,  bringing  the  latter  (12,000 tons) to the  highest point  reached  since last november.  As to stocks held by the Ministry on the same dates, the seasonal decreasein cereals  (34,000 tons)  was much less than in the preceding weeks, and was morethan balanced by an increase  in  the quantity in  transit to the  United  Kingdom;movements of other stocks  agree generally with changes in the  total stocks of thecountry, the most marked being an increase of  3,200 tons in butter, and a  decrease of3,200 tons in bacon.                                  CONSUMPTION.    Butchers  Meat. In the two  weeks ended 12th April supplies of live stock atmarkets were comparatively high, following  upon the rise of prices to farmers at thebeginning of the  month.  The  increase of home supplies was not balanced by an equal decrease of the demand  for imported meat, issues  of which were  10,500 tonsand 9,900 tons respectively for the two weeks.  This  agrees with the  experience ofrecent months, that the demand for meat  is governed by the volume of home-grownsupplies.  Estimated  total&apos;consumption  consequently rose, though that  of  rationedmeats was still considerably below the quantity available for the public.    Other Food-stuffs. Table B (1) shows some marked variations in the quantitiesof food-stuffs passing into  distribution.   The continued  decline of  the  quantity of flour delivered from mills or from imported stocks  balances the exceptionally  largeissues in  the first  two  months of the year.  The movements - in  bacon and tea are largely  associated  with  the  removal of  control; traders  are unwilling to  take  large supplies till the probable effect of  the proposed action can be gauged, and this  delay in distribution is followed by a rush for  supplies.  The first stage is illustrated  in therecent figures for bacon, and the second in those for tea.  Owing to the removal ofcontrol, figures  for the quantities  of margarine  distributed weekly are no longeravailable, and  estimates based on the  output of  factories are  liable  to greaterfluctuations.                                     PRICES.    According to  the data  collected by the Department  of Labour Statistics, theincrease in retail,  food prices  on  1st April since July 19.14  was 113 per cent., ascompared with 120 per cent, on 1st March.    In the following  table there is presented a measure of variations  in  expenditureupon  food.  The  data for June  1914 and  June  1918 are as given by the TreasuryCommittee presided over by Lord  Sumner, while the estimates for latter  months are obtained by applying to the data for June 1918  subsequent charges  in  prices and changes, in the food stuffs consumed by the general population.  The estimate for april 1919 is likely to  be an under-estimate, since the consumption in this  monthhas probably increased beyond the standard  indicated  by the figures  at present available.
