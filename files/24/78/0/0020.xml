 Circulated by the Secretary of State for India. SECRET.                         .     I circulate to my colleagues a note on future arrangements  for the  disposal in the Dinted Kingdom of official business relating  to Egypt, Aden, Cyprus, Palestine,  Persia, the Persian Gulf,  and Mesopotamia,  which lias  been  submitted to me  by the  Civil Commissioner at Baghdad.     14th April 1919.                                                          E. S. M.     l^our possible courses present themselves :      (1)  Administration by the Foreign Office or by a Department under the Foreign Office. r&apos;  The disadvantages of this appear to me briefly as follows :    / l^o)&apos; The  Foreign   Office is not  an  administrative  office and  is  not  equipped  for           //administration.  e.g., it  lias no Stores Department,  no Revenue,  Financial, or              Judicial Department, and  few officers with practical experience of  controlling              the administration of foreign countries.       (b)  It would  in  some ways he inconvenient if Mesopotamia and the Persian Gulf and . ^           Aden were to be wholly divorced from India./ &quot;   (c)  For many years to come there will be a good deal of  business with  foreign nations              regarding  these  countries; it is on  the  whole  preferable that negotiations in              this connection should not be  dealt with by the office actually responsible for              the administration.  Otherwise there  is a danger  of confusion of issues.                   (2) Administration by an entirely separate Department.     The disadvantages of this proposal appear to be        ia)  Expense. The whole machinery of a large office would  have to  be set up, and it              would not be easy to get either the  funds to do  so, or.the right men for some              of the posts.       (b)  The Persian Gulf, Mesopotamia, and Aden would still be  wholly divorced from              India.       (c) There  would be much  overlapping;  the Department would have to  be housed              elsewhere  than  in Downing Street and this would make inter-communication              between the new Department and the Foreign  Office and  India Office more              difficult.     (3) Administration by the present Colonial Office or by a reconstituted Colonial Office,                      the Dominions eoviing under the Privy Council.     I  am little acquainted with the arguments for or against this course, but-       (a)  it involves a great extension of Colonial Office responsibility in regions in which it              has not hitherto been concerned ;       (b)  the Persian Gulf,  Mesopotamia  and Aden would still be  wholly divorced from              India ;       (e) the countries  in question are not  colonies,  and public feeling  in  them might  be              unfavourably affected if they were even ostensibly dealt with as such.     (4)  Administration by the India Office, reconstituted as the India and Middle Eastern -              Office, with a special Under Secretary of State for the Middle East.     I  am not sufficiently  acquainted with the  constitution of the India Office, nor with  the nature of the proposals now on foot for its  re-constitution, to be able to hazard an opinion as to how far  this is practicable.  It has the following advantages :      (a)  The administrative machinery and expert knowledge and experience required  for the            guidance and  control of a British administration in  the East is ready to  hand, and            the additional staff required  would not be large.   The additional accommodation            could probably be found within the  India Office.  A very large sum  could thus            be saved.     (//)  Relations between India and the countries  mentioned  above would be co-ordinated            and friction avoided.   The  problems arising in  the above countries  are  closely            interconnected, and experience in  one  country will be of assistance in deciding            questions arising in another.     (/;)  For many years past  the India and  Foreign Offices have worked  in close  relations            with  each other  in regard  to Middle  Eastern questions.  The  transfer  to  the            India Office of the responsibility for these countries could thus be  effected  with a            minimum of friction and loss of efficiency.     (d)  The difficulty of  obtaining technical  and  other personnel, and of dealing with  the            multifarious  petty details of administration could perhaps be surmounted  by  the            constitution of agencies (similar to those of the Crown Agents) for India and  for            the other countries under the India Office, which would perform the functions now            fulfilled by the Director-General of Stores.     (c)  The proposal  now before the Secretary of State  to  amalgamate the Indo-European            Telegraph Department with Mesopotamia telegraphs and possibly with other State            Telegraph Departments would be facilitated by this change.     30th March 1919.                        (Sgd.)    A.  T. WILSON, Lieut-Col,                                                                   Civil Commissioner,     SS 78  45  4/19
