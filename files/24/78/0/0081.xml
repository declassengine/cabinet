SECRET.                   MINISTET   OF   FOOD.     Report  for  Week  ending Wednesday,  April  30,  1919.ill         &apos;                         &quot;&apos;                         PART  I. ACTION  TAKEN.    Food Council. The Food Council met on April 24th and 29th.    It was agreed that it was desirable that, on the dissolution of the Ministry of Food,responsibility for work in connection with the  production of forma should be  trans-ferred to the Board of Agriculture, from which  Department it was originally taken overby the Food  Controller.  One mill at King&apos;s  Lynn  is now in operation and threeothers,  work  on which is well  advanced,  will be  completed  as  soon as  finalexperiments have been carried out at King&apos;s Lynn.  Since there is a steady demand forfarina for use in the textile trades, as well as for food purposes, and since the demandfor potatoes, as the raw material of the industry, will be  of  great value in stabilisingpotato prices when there are large supplies, it was considered  that  the establishment and maintenance of this industry is of considerable importance.    A proposal to suspend the maximum fish prices still in  force was considered.  Itwas decided that the maximum prices for herrings and mackerel should be suspendedas from May 15th, but that the remaining maximum prices, on such fish as salmon,sole and turbot, should be retained for the present.    The question of the compensation to be paid to  farmers in respect of abnormalwastage to potatoes was again considered and it was agreed     (1) that in certain scheduled districts local committees representing the Ministry           of Food and the farmers, with an impartial chairman, should be set up to           investigate claims in  respect of  loss and to report the facts to the Food           Controller with a view to compensation or ex gratia payments being made           where the circumstances justified such a course.    (2) that  differences arising  between, the Food Controller and the potato growers           on the  question of liability may be referred to arbitration.    (3) that in districts not included in the schedule, claims  should be sent  direct           to  the Divisional Food Commissioner.    It was decided that, with  a  view to removing  the  present hardship of British importers of frozen meat  resulting from the small amount of  Australasian meat available for distribution, the  stocks of South American meat  released for civilian consumption should be handed  to  the Associated Meat Importers&apos; Committee to be divided between the British agents and the agents of the South American companies in the proportion of the total volume of trade handled  by them  respectively before the war.     H.M. Treasury having again refused to  sanction the purchase of the, exportable surplus of Canadian cheese it was agreed not to press the matter further, but to warn H.M. Treasury that their decision may involve  entering the market at a later date and purchasing the supplies required at an enhanced price.     The Consumers&apos;1 Council. The Council meet on April 30th.     The Council again expressed the opinion  that it was desirable in the interests of the consumer that  the  existence of the  Ministry of Food should be continued.  The Food Controller, who was present at the meeting, assured the Council that their views would  be laid before the Cabinet.     The following resolution on fish prices was passed:             &quot;The  Council views with  concern  the  fact that the retail prices  of fish        are higher than those which the Food Ministry publishes from time to time as        being  reasonable,  and urges that  immediate action be taken  to stop this        profiteering.&quot;     Imports Board. Private traders are experiencing difficulty in arranging for the shipment of bacon, hams  and lard, and, as  the Ministry&apos;s shippings in these com- modities are  practically  over,  stocks  will  decrease rapidly  during  May.   It  is     A  (33)8000-1 Pkll) 150  5/19 E&amp;S                                         A
 anticipated that the position  will  become  serious unless considerable  supplies are forthcoming on private account.   It  is hoped,  however, that  it will be possible for the necessary arrangements for securing tonnage to be made shortly.     The Ministry of Food are taking over 1,200 tons  of War Office cheese now on&apos; passage to this  country from Egypt.   The New Zealand stock  is estimated to be 35,000 tons,  but shipments continue to be meagre.   Steps  will  be taken  to  limit arrivals of cheese in this  country from July to October, during which months large quantities may be expected from Canada, to an amount that can be  effectively handled. In order  that a close watch may be kept&apos; on the  position, it  is proposed to  require private traders to furnish particulars of their shipments and expected arrivals.                  RELAXATION  OF  EXPORT AND  IMPORT RESTRICTIONS.     Export Restrictions. At the  date  of the Armistice the list of  prohibited goods included  120 commodities with which the Ministry of Food were concerned.  Of these over 50 have now been either  removed from the list or freed from any restrictions so far as  the Ministry are concerned.  In addition, in many cases  it has been possible for manufactured articles to be freed from  restriction, although  it has been necessary to retain  control of the raw material.     The foodstuffs which have thus been set free for export include all kinds of potted, preserved, and frozen fish, except canned salmon; pickles, spices,  sauces, tinned and potted meats;  honey, saccharin, syrup, moist sugar, molasses,  aerated mineral waters and manufactured   articles  containing sugar,  except  such  goods  as  jam  and confectionery; arrowroot,  cornflour,  dextrine, mandioca and certain  other cereal products ; and wine and spirits, except whisky.     In addition to alterations which have thus been  made in  the  prohibited list, the Ministry of Food have  agreed that  certain  important foodstuffs which it is not con- sidered possible  to  remove at once  from the  list, should be licensed  for  export to approved destinations either  without limit  or  else in  very large  quantities ; these include cocoa  powder, raw cocoa, block cocoa, dates, tea, coffee and tomato pulp.  A more limited export is also allowed in respect of confectionery, malt and malt products, lemons, oranges, yeast, prepared suets and other commodities.   Moreover, the quantity of. beer and ale which may be exported  has  recently been increased from one-third, to two-thirds of  pre-war exports.     Of the classes of articles in respect of which the Food Controller is still unable to authorise the  removal from the prohibited list, more  than 30  are cereals and  animal feeding stuffs ; others are essential or important foodstuffs and raw materials  of which there is still a shortage of supply, including, in addition to those named in the previous paragraph, sugar, butter,  cheese,  eggs, meat  and poultry, fruits (other  than  lemons and  oranges), onions, edible oils and fats, oleaginous kernels and seeds.     The  question of the  removal of condensed milk  from  the  list is now under consideration with H.M. Treasury.     Import Restrictions. At  the date of the signing of the Armistice the following were the  most important  foodstuffs of which the importation  was  prohibited  except under licenpe :  bacon, hams and lard, beer, spirits and wine, butter and cheese, cocoa, tea and  coffee, canned  salmon, canned, bottled, dried and preserved  fruits,  except currants,  raw  fruit, except lemons  and bitter  oranges,  sugar  and  preparations containing sugar.     During November general licences  were issued permitting the importation from all sources of apples, bananas, almonds and nuts used as fruit, canned, bottled  andpreserved fruits and  raw cocoas.  General licences have also now been issued in thecase of the following foodstuffs:  bacon,  hams, lard,  tea, coffee, dried  fruits, cannedbottled and  preserved fruits, sweet oranges,  tinned lobsters, crabs,  prawns   and oysters, vegetables (except gherkins  in  brine),  canned,  bottled, dried and preservedvegetables, soya beans, tallow, cocoa powder, yeast, brandy, rum, Geneva Hollands,liqueurs and wine.     The Ministry of Food are also in communication with the Department of Import Restrictions with  a  view to the prohibition being removed in the  case of the  fol-lowing  articles : cocoa butter,  canned, bottled, dried  and  preserved vegetables, olive oil, raw fruit of. all kinds, jam, confectionery  and  other goods included under the heading &quot; articles containing sugar &quot; which may be agreed by the Sugar Commission, tomatoes,  and  stearine.                                                  &apos;   . .
    The maintenance of the  prohibitions on  beer, sugar, butter,  cheese, canned salmon and the Norwegian canned  fish is  considered necessary for the present.  Itmust, however, be  remembered in this connection, that the  Board of Trade  haverecently issued a general licence permitting the free importation of Colonial products,and that existing prohibitions accordingly apply only to  foreign  products other  thanFrench, which are entitled to admission under an international agreement.    Licences  are now being granted freely by the Royal Commission on  the SugarSupply for private imports of sugar  from foreign countries.                           SUPPLIES AND DISTRIBUTION.    Rationing. The coupons in the current ration books come to an end on May 3rd,and while no coupons will be required for the purchase of any kind of food after thatdate, the ration books  will still  be needed  in connection with the rationing of meat,sugar and butter, which, will probably continue until June 30th.   During this periodcustomers will continue to be registered with retailers but a freer exchange of retailerwill be allowed than has hitherto been the case.   It is proposed to abolish all rationing and the registration of customers on June 30th, but it will still be necessary to control the distribution of meat, sugar and butter to retailers for  a further, period.    Meat. Owing to the holding back of  stock, with a view to the increase of the wholesale price on May 1st, the supply of live stock  has  recently been deficient.  Ashome-killed and frozen meat will no longer  be  sold at the same price after May 3rd, itwill  be necessary that  both  varieties  should  be on  sale at  the same time and  it is accordingly proposed to discontinue the policy of supplying districts with only frozenmeat in alternate weeks.    A deputation of London retail  butchers waited on the Director of Meat supplies on Monday   April  28th  with  reference to the  grading and  allocation  of  certaindescriptions of imported meat.  A  satisfactory arrangement was arrived at by whichthe butchers  were given  the right of nominating four representatives to act with theGrading Committee appointed  by  the Smithfield  Control  Board  to deal Avith theallocation of imported meat.  .               ORDERS UNDER  DEFENCE OF THE REALM REGULATIONS.    The Milk (Summer Prices)  Order,  1919, dated 24th April 19.19, fixes wholesaleand retail prices for milk from  May to September.   The Order embodies the recom-mendations of the Travelling Commission on milk, details of  which were given in theReports of April 9th and 23rd.

ENFORCEMENT OF  ORDERS.    The total number  of  prosecutions during the fortnight ended April 19tli  was1,253, of which 1,135 were successful.PART  II. SUMMARY  OF THE  FOOD POSITION.                                      IMPORTS.     The total imports of the principal foods and feeding-stuffs, which in the precedingweek had advanced  to  156,900 tons, rose sharply in the week ended 26th  April to205,800 tons.   This is considerably above the average  for  the first 19 weeks  of the calendar year  (150,200  tons)  and  that  for the current cereal year to date (165,500tons).  Sugar accounts for practically the whole of the increase on  the precedingweek,  arrivals  of  this. commodity  rising from  22,900  tons  to  68,200 tons,  a record quantity for  recent years.  Arrivals of  cereals  (91,000 tons)  also showed  afurther improvement on  the figures  for preceding weeks, and the quantity of bacon(19,000 tons) was  the largest received in any one week this  year.   Meat, however, felloff from 19,800 tons in the preceding week to 12,900 tons.     Of the  less  bulky  commoditities,  butter  (2,300  tons)  continued  to arrive in comparatively large  quantities,  but. cheese (700 tons) and  lard  (500  tons)  compare unfavourably with the average  weekly quantities  received this year.   This  appliesalso  to condensed  milk, the actual quantity of which, however, 1,600 tons,  is still verylarge.  Imports of tea,  coffee  and cocoa, continue considerably  above  the pre-waraverage.   In the week ended 26th April the tea  received (3,300 tons) was only slightlybelow the average for recent months, while coffee (1,600 tons) and cocoa  (3,900 tons)were both largely  in. excess of it.     The figures for the first 34- weeks of the cereal years 1917-18 and 1918-19  arecompared in the following table :-Total Imports for the first 34 weeks of Cereal Year (4i/i September to 2Qth April).Total -wheat flour -Equivalent.  as Grain.Bice  -Barley,  oats,  and maize.jVIeat -1918-1!).Increase or Decrease on     1917-1S.

                                    STOCKS.     Total stocks of meat and provisions  in cold stores and importers&apos; warehouses on19th April showed a slight general  downward movement.  The one exception was inthe case  of  canned meats (31,100 tons), which  showed  an increase of 2,300 tons onstocks already equal to a years supply.  Stocks of butter (12,000 tons) also maintainedthe high level of the preceding week.&apos;  Of the commodities showing a  decrease, themost important were cheese, which  fell by 2,300 tons to 5,600 tons, and bacon, which fell by 3,200 tons to 31,700 tons.  On the other hand stocks of these commodities heldby the Ministry rose ;  the increase of 800 tons in cheese, making a stock of 6,500 tons,is explained by the  fact that no distribution occurred during the week,  while theMinistry stock also includes large imports of the preceding week in process of transportover the country.   In the  case of  bacon, there was a drop in  the quantity allocatedfrom Government  stocks, which  now represent  about  one-half of the total stocks incold stores and importers&apos; warehouses.  Of the other stocks held  by the Ministry on19th April,  butter (14,000  tons or  9 weeks&apos; supply), lard (12,800 tons  or 4  weeks&apos;supply) and refrigerated  meat  (25,500 tons or under a  week&apos;s total requirements of meat), showed small  decreases, while tea (40,000 tons or 13 weeks&apos; supply) and driedfruits (24,500 tons) rose slightly.                               WHOLESALE PRICES.     Average wholesale prices for April as  compared with those for  March showed aslight upward tendency in home-grown cereals, wheat rising from 72s. M. to 72s. lid.per quarter, and barley from  62s. fid. to  62s. 9d. ; on the other hand maize fell from64s. to 60s. per quarter.   The reduction of the flat wholesale rates (home and imported)for  beef and for mutton, rendered necessary by the lower retail prices fixed in March,is reflected fully in the average April prices, which were  116s. Sd. and  123s. Sd. percwt. respectively, as  against 121s.  Id.  and 128s. Id.,  respectively, for  March.  Thesame course of events accounts for  the further reduction  in cheese from 159s. 9d. to144s. Sd. per cwt.  Under the Bacon and Ham (Prices) Order, 1919, the average price for  home-produced  bacon rose from 194s. M. to 200s.  M. per cwt.;  as  against this,measures of decontrol resulted in a  slight decrease in the average price of Canadianbacon from 185s. to 184s. bd.  per  cwt.  Measures of decontrol are also responsible for.the decrease in the wholesale price of India and  Ceylon tea from  Is. 4tL to  Is. Id.per lb., the average for April being Is. 2d.  There was a general downward tendency in the  price of oilseeds and oilcake, linseed (Calcutta) falling from 7I5s. to .597s. M.per  ton, palm kernels from  539s.  to 516s. od., and  cottonseed  cake from  300s. to297s. Qd,; on the other hand cottonseed (Egyptian) rose from 376s. to 380s. per ton.A 8000-T
