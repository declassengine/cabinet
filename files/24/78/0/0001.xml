MINISTET   OF   FOOD.Report for Week ending  Wednesday,  April 9,  1919.PART  X.-ACTION  TAKEN.    The following is a summary of the action  already taken and proposed by theMinistry of Food towards relinquishing control of the commodities dealt with by theDepartment.  The position so far as cereals  are concerned was dealt with  in. lastweek&apos;s Report.                        RELAXATIONS  ALREADY  EFFECTED.    1. The  following are  the  principal relaxations effected  in the rationing andregistration  system since November  11th.  As regards meat,  retailers have  been permitted since December 1st to sell edible offals, including tongue, kidney and skirt,free of the  coupon.  In addition  to  some  concessions made  during the Christmasperiod, the value o  the meat coupon was increased from id. to  bd. on December  29th,pork,  poultry, game, hares,  rabbits, horseflesh  and canned meats being at  the  sametime freed from all rationing restrictions.  Since February 9th, catering establishmentshave been permitted to supply meat meals without coupons.    The ration of  butter and margarine was increased from 5 ozs.  to  6 ozs.  onJanuary 12th.  On February 16th margarine was  released from the coupon, but until March 1st registration for margarine was still necessary.  The butter ration will shortly be increased from 1 oz. to 2 ozs.     Lard was released from the coupon on December 15th.                      7 1    In addition to some  concessions  at Christmas, the  sugar ration was  raised  from ozs. to 12 ozs. on January 26th.     Coupons are now required only for butcher&apos;s meat, sugar, jam, marmalade andbutter ; but concessions have been introduced at various dates since the armistice bywhich in  all these cases (except jam) retailers may sell to their  registered customersany surplus quantities available over and above the ration.     It.has  also  been possible, owing  to the  increased, supplies  of rationed  foodsavailable, to effect a&quot; considerable swing of. expenditure  by  the  abolition of  thearrangements for checking coupon sales by retailers.     2. A number of reductions in price have also been made.  Margarine was reducedby 2d. a lb. as early as November 17th, and has since been decontrolled.   Meat, both home  produced and imported, was reduced by 2d. a lb. on March 3rd.   Cheese was reduced by  2d. a lb. on March 19th.   Condensed milk has been reduced by l^d. a tin(December 9th), dried fruits by 2d. to id. a lb. (February 17th) and canned salmon byid. to Id.  a  tin  (March  20th).  Pulses were reduced from   2d. to 3rf.  a lb. onMarch 31st.     In the case of meat, the Ministry of Food  were materially assisted by the decisionof  the Inter-Departmental  Committee on the  Reduction of  Prices, under which H.M.Treasury have undertaken liability for losses involved in the reduction in price which took place on March 3rd  and also in the prospective  reduction of 2d. a lb. on imported meat on May 1st.                                                         ; &apos; s -     Other reductions have also taken place, e.g., tea  is now being sold at between id.and 6d. a lb. less than the former controlled price  of  2s. 8d. ; margarine is, for thepresent at  any rate, being sold at 9d. a lb. instead of the  former price of Is!;  theprice  of  eggs has been  reduced by  about  l\d., and there have also been  somereductions in the prices of  cereal products and fresh  fruit.     3. Bread of pre-war quality was restored on December 16th, when the average rate of extraction required from wheat was  reduced  to 76 per cent.  During the timeof  greatest  stringency the  percentage required was 91  per  cent.    The presentpercentage is as low as millers would adopt with control removed.     Among other relaxations to the consumer may be quoted  the removal of restrictionson sugar confectionery and cake and pastry (December  7th), on the sale of sweetmeats     A (33)7792-2  l&apos;k 16  150 4/19 E&amp;S                                           A
(March 1st), and ice cream (March 22nd), the sale of  milk as a beverage (March 15th),and the supply of sugar for beverages (March 24th).     4, Freedom to the trade  as regards supplies, distribution and prices has  been restored in the case  of  margarine (March  2nd), most kinds of fish (March 3rd), andlard (March .31st);. as  regards supplies and distribution,  but not price,  in  the  caseof bacon, dried fruits&apos; and cocoa (March 31st);  as regards  distribution  and prices in-the case of tea (March 24th); and as regards  prices only in the case of maize and maize products (March 22nd), and condensed milk (March 31st).     The Pig Sales Order by which  pigs for slaughter were  sent to a market wherethey were sold to a Government buyer for allocation to bacon curers, pork butchers,manufacturers, &amp;c, with a view to limiting &quot;prices and ensuring equitable distribution,&amp;c, was withdrawn on December 29th and replaced by an Order prescribing maximum prices only.     Owing to increased tonnage,  it  has also  been possible for the  feeding  stuffsrationing system, which was  in force at the end of last  year, to be relaxed.   since january 25th,  the only machinery necessary has been the issue of priority certificatesin exceptional cases.   Control over the distribution of feeding stuffs will cease entirely on April 27th.     5.  The development of trade has further been encouraged  by the release.of rawmaterials to manufacturers, e.g., the quantity of  sugar supplied to  manufacturers hasbeen quadrupled and low grade sugar has  been entirely freed (February 24th) ; theprices.of oils and fats (affecting  margarine, cattle cake, soap, &amp;c.) have been reduced(February  17th  and  March  3rd) and restrictions on  their  distribution  have  been removed (March 8th).     6  Numerous relaxations have been made in the  import and export  prohibitions in force before the cessation of hostilities.   Unrestricted importation is  now permitted in  the  case of bacon,  hams, lard, tea, coffee,  raw cocoa, fresh fruit (except  sweet oranges), canned  and preserved fruit, vegetables in brine, unsweetened  aerated andmineral waters,  &amp;c.   Further, a general licence has  recently  been issued by the Board  of  Trade permitting  the unrestricted  importation (except as regards  spirits other than  brandy or rum)  of goods produced in and exported from any part of the British Empire.    , The Ministry are now in communication  with the Chancellor of  the Exchequer with a  view to the  removal  of the  present restrictions on the importation  of  sweet oranges,  to which  the  Treasury  have not  so far  felt able to  agree owing  to considerations of exchange.     7; The principal foodstuffs in  the case of which export prohibitions have now been removed are canned and potted fish (except salmon), dried eggs, honey, tinned and potted meats, coffee essence, wines, condensed milk, milk  powder,  aerated and mineral waters, saccharine, syrup, biscuits,  cakes, oatmeal, cornflour, and other cereals and cereal products, and all  spirits  except whisky, &amp;c, &amp;c.   There are also limited export  facilities in the case of cocoa butter, raw cocoa, dates, tea, coffee, bacon andlard, confectionery,  lemons,  margarine and compound  lard, &amp;c, &amp;c.   Further, the-quantity of  beer  and ale which  maybe exported  has recently been  increased from one-third to two-thirds of pre-war exports.                    PROSPECTIVE STAGES OF FUTURE DECONTROL.  :   .8.  Meat-Home-produced meat is subject to engagements entered into with the farmers and cannot be freed from control as regards production, distribution or prices until September 30th. - -  Imported meat will be freed from  control on June 30th with the exception thatmaximum prices will  be maintained till September 30th.     As regards canned  meat, the Ministry&apos;s stocks will be liquidated and control will cease about June 30th.     Bacon. Control  of imports  and distribution has already been removed.   It is expected that the stocks held  by the Ministry  will be liquidated,  prices freed and complete decontrol effected by June 30th.     9.  Milk. The recommendations to be made  by the  Ministry of; Food to the Cabinet on the future of milk control will shortly be decided upon.      &apos;-  ;   Condensed Milk. Distribution  will be freed on  May  31st.  Control of prices should be relinquished shortly afterwards.
     Butter.-Owing to the shortage of supplies,  it, will  probably be,.necessary for control, including organised distribution to the trade, to be continued until; the spring of 1920.  ,                                     ...                ,, &apos;(,&apos;; &apos;&apos;j     Cheese.-Substantial imports are in sight, and it  is expected that distribution \bythe Ministry to the trade will  cease not later than  June 30th.:  The Ministry, acting,.through the Butter and Cheese Imports Committee,  have however made, contracts, in:order to ensure the necessary supplies, up to the summer of 1920, and it  will thereforebe necessary to retain a measure of controi  until that date.     10. Tea.-The stocks  of  the Ministry are  being disposed of  gradually (in  con-junction with private imports) and  will  be liquidated by December 31st.   Somerestriction on exports may also be required until December 31st.     Coffee. It  is expected that restrictions on prices will  be removed by April 30th,but in this case also some control over exports may  be necessary until December 31st.     Coeoa. Cocoa is now controlled only as regards prices and exports.  It is expected&apos;that these controls will be removed by May 31st and June 30th respectively.     Dried Fruits.-The Ministry&apos;s stocks will be liquidated by April 30th but pricerestrictions may  be required until August 31st.     11. Jam. Rationing will cease on May 3rd.  Control  of  distribution and pricesmust be maintained until the prospects of the coming fruit season  can be foreseen, but its removal should be possible  about June 30th.     Onions and Potatoes should  be  freed not later than May  31st and July 31strespectively.     Poultry, Game and Rabbits should be freed before June 30th.     Fish should be completely decontrolled by May 15th.     Canned Salmon. The  date for decontrol depends  upon the effect  on the market:of distribution of the Ministry&apos;s stocks.  Unless the Canadian pack purchased by theMinistry is abnormally late, control should  be relinquished by the middle of November..     12. Sugar. Control over  sugar must be retained for the present.   The wholesaleprice at which sugar is now being sold in  this country is appreciably below the price at which it would stand on imports purchased to-day in the producing markets.   It  isexpected that it  will be necessary for the Sugar Commission to continue to safeguardsupplies and  distribution over the next harvest.     Food Council. The Council met on April  3rd.     The arrangements for  rationing or registration after  the expiry of  the presentation books on May 3rd were  considered, and it was decided that      (1) no fresh ration books  should be issued  to the public generally and no coupons&quot;           required for the purchase of any kind of food after May 3;     (2) registration of  customers should be  continued   for a  limited period after           May 3rd in  respect of meat,  sugar  and butter,  and the  current  ration           books, must accordingly be kept by  their holders ;     (3) a freer exchange of retailers should be permitted to the consumer ;      :  -     (4) it should be optional for retailers to require registered customers to produce           ration books for marking when  purchases are made, with the object  of           preventing a customer from being served twice;     (5) retailers should continue to obtain their supplies of meat and imported butter as           at present.   They will be allowed  to obtain  British-made  butter without           permits.  On the expiry of the present set of vouchers for sugar,  a further           issue will be made to retailers.     .        .....   - iUSu  j     It was considered, probable that registration would  not be required aijter the endof June, and that the system would then come  to an end.                  ;     The  Food   Council  decided that  the Cream  Order  ,.sho.uld   be  ! suspendedexperimentally from the present time until the end of June.     Consumers1&apos;Council. The Council met on April 9th.     The. unanimous opinion  was expressed that  in the  interest of  the consumerthe Ministry of  Food should be established as a permanent department with powers ofcontrol over production, distribution, quality and  prices.   The  Food  Controller whowas present at the meeting was  asked to  bring before the War  Cabinet the case, putforward by  the Council  for the maintenance  of a  Ministry  of Food, Supply or Commerce, with the  duty of protecting  the  public in  such matters, and agreed  todo SO.&quot;      &quot;5  &apos; &apos;&apos;*%    &apos;   r.              7-  &apos;&quot;    :&apos;r.&apos;&quot;&apos;..&apos;      ,.-&apos;U &apos;:&apos;  .

    The Council  decided to offer  no objection  to the  recommendations  of the travelling Commission of Inquiry into the cost of production of milk on the prices tobe paid to producers of milk (which are given in another part of this Report), so far asMay and June are concerned ; but preferred to place upon the  Food  Controller theresponsibility of deciding whether prices should be  fixed for the  later months, andwhether the general proposals made in the Report should be adopted.     Imports Board. Shipments of feeding stuffs from Burmah are again late and theMinistry of Shipping  have  been requested to expedite the despatch  of supplies.Owing  to  unfavourable weather  conditions  this season&apos;s supply of  butter from australia is not expected to  exceed  10,500  tons as  compared with the  estimate  of30,000 tons.   On March 29th  the balance of Egyptian cotton seed  at Alexandria was15,700  tons, but of this  5,000  tons have been released at the request  of general allenby to meet local demands.     Although no  canned meat  has been bought  by the  Ministry for the last  sixmonths, 10,000 tons, of  the value of  1,750,0002., are still held, while the stocks in  thehands of the War Office are of an  approximate value of  2,000,0001.  The total stocksrepresent approximately  a  year&apos;s normal  consumption, and  in addition very large stocks are held by the trade, while the private  shipments on passage to this  countryamount to nearly 11,000 tons.  Steps are being taken to dispose of the stocks in thiscountry and, if possible, for relief purposes in Europe.]                              SUMMER MILK PRICES.    The following is a  summary of recommendations made  by the Travelling Corn-mission of Inquiry into the cost of the production of milk.    1. We  consider that  in  fixing prices  for  milk  in  1919,  the  following  general principles should he observed :     (a) Summer and winter  periods should be defined as in 1918, i.e., there should           be five summer and seven winter months.    (&amp;)  The price  fixed  in each period  should be a uniform price over  the whole           number of  months, but  differential  rates should  be fixed in individual           months, averaging out to a uniform maximum price over the period.    2. In comparing the cost of milk production in the summer of .1918, as shown bythe  returns which we have received, with the probable cost in  1919, we have come tothe conclusion that the only item of expense which will be materially increased in thelatter period is that of labour, the additional  charges for which will, in our estimation,increase the cost of milk production  by approximately  Id per gallon.  We wish  tomake clear the fact that our recommendations as to price are based upon  the assump-tion that the rates of wages and hours recently agreed  upon will remain  in force duringthe  summer period.    3. We consider that the following should  be the prices paid to the producer for milk during the  summer of 1919 in England and Wales and  Scotland respectively.Month.	Price in England and Wales.	Price in Scotland.May -June -July..... August - - - - -September - -Average - &apos; - -	s. d. 1 4 1 3 1 6 1 8 1 10	s. d. 1 6 1 4 1 4 1 10	1 6i	1 61    These recommendations are based on the assumption that the milk is delivered tothe producers railway station, ie., that the producer does not bear the cost of railwaytransport.    4. As a  result o  our  investigations  in different parts of the country  we  are convinced of the advisability of  varying  the prices paid to producers for milk indifferent districts.    5. We consider that milk can be produced more cheaply in the  counties  of cornwall, Devonshire, Somersetshire and Dorset than in the remaining parts of Great
             PART II.-SUMMARY  OF THE FOOD POSITION.                                   Imports.    The total imports  of  the principal foods and feeding-stuffs in the week ended5th April  (119,600 tons) were only slightly higher than those of the preceding week(116,900 tons), and  continued the low level of recent weeks.   They were still belowthe average of the first 14 weeks of the  calendar year (145,500 tons), and that of thefirst 31 weeks of the cereal year (164,900 tons).   While the total quantity of cereals(55,300  tons) showed a recovery fronir the  exceptionally  low figure  of the previousweek, the improvement was due entirely to larger arrivals  of barley, oats and maize,                                                                        A 3Britain.  This is due chiefly to climatic conditions.   Owing to the earlier summer andmilder autumn  in these districts  it is possible for cows to remain at pasture from april  1st  to  November 1st, while  in summer there is  not the  same  need forconcentrated  foods  as  in other parts of the country.  Prolonged droughts such  asthose generally experienced in the Eastern counties are practically  unknown.  We .therefore recommend that the price  paid to  the producer for milk in these countiesshould be 2d. per gallon lower throughout the year than  that paid in the rest  ofEngland and Wales.     6. We consider that in one area in Yorkshire-the industrial district of  the WestRiding milk is produced  under exceptionally difficult conditions.  This  is due to several causes:      (a) Atmospheric Conditions. Throughout this area  the atmospheric conditions           are  such that all crops, including grass, are stunted in growth, lowered in           feeding value, and perhaps in  some instances rendered directly injurious           to stock.   This is due to  the  smoke,  soot and  chemical fumes  from           collieries,  coke  ovens,  carbonising works,  &amp;c.   Owing  to the harmful           effect  of these  conditions, it  is  the almost  universal  custom  for. milk           producers to change the  greater part  of their herds annually,  which           materially increases the amount to be allowed for depreciation.     (b) Rent. In spite of  the  atmospheric conditions, agricultural land in this           district is highly rented 40s. to 50s. per acre.     (c) Labour Supply. The presence of numerous factories intensifies the labour           shortage in  respect of women  as well as men, and has increased the rate           of wages.     We therefore recommend that producers in this area should be permitted  to charge a price 2d. per gallon higher than  that prevailing in the rest of England andWales.     7. We consider  that for the successful working  of any scheme  of differentia]prices, it is necessary that the G-overnment should control the wholesale milk trade.               ORDERS UNDER DEFENCE OF THE REALM REGULATIONS.     Orders dated &quot;4th April 1919 revoke  the Wholesale Milk Dealers (Control) Order, 1918,  as from  April  30th,  and  the Canned Meats (Maximum Prices)  Order,  1918, as from April 4th.     An Order  dated 7th April 1919,  amending the Edible Offals (Maximum Prices) Order, 1918, reduces the prices of edible offals in  proportion to the  recent reduction of meat prices.                              ENFORCEMENT OF ORDERS.     The total number of prosecutions during the week ended March 29th was 855, of which 802 were successful.   In a case at Wandsworth,  a butcher was able, by keeping- two sets of accounts, not only to supply a household with large quantities of meat for its  own consumption,  but  also to  provide the members of  the household with joints of meat for disposal elsewhere.  No proceedings appear  to have  been taken against the consumer, but fines amounting to 200Z., and 10L 10s. costs, were inflicted upon the butcher.
whereas wheat fell off further, and  no rice at all was received.   The arrivals of bacon(6,500 tons) showed a considerable improvement on recent weeks, though  they were still only three fourths of current requirements.   The  large  quantity  of sugar(35,600 tons) maintained the improvement of  the last three weeks which has reversedthe downward movement of sugar  stocks in the United Kingdom.   Of the remainingitems, the outstanding features were the large quantities&apos; of butter (3,600 tons), whichwas about double the average for the year -so - far, and also double that of the corres-ponding weeks of last-year ; and on the other hand, the practical disappearance of lardand cheese imports.    The figures for  the first.31 weeks of the cereal years 1917-18  and  1918-19 arecompared in  the following table : --&quot;            ,Total Imports for the first 31 weeks of Cereal Year (1st September to 6t/i April). 	1918-19.

Butchers&apos; Meat. In the last week of March supplies of live stock in Great Britainfell to a low  level, and  estimated  total  supplies  of- home-grown meat  were only11,200 tons.   Issues  of  imported: meat  were  11,000 tons,  making  total  supplies22,200 tons.   For the four  weeks  ended 29th  March  the  estimated&apos;  total weekly consumption by civilians in Great Britain was 23,300 tons, of  which 18,800 tons wererationed  meats;  that  is, the  demand for the latter was  29 per cent, less than  thesupplies which the Ministry was prepared to put at the disposal of the public.  Ofthe total  consumption  14,600 tons, or 63 per cent., were home-grown.  A year beforethe estimated weekly  consumption  by civilians in Great Britain was ,17,700 tons, ofwhich 13,100 tons, or 74 per cent., were home-grown supplies.    Flour. In Table C (2) the index numbers  illustrating  variations in the quantityof flour delivered from mills  or released from imported  supplies is continued for thefour weeks ended 29th March,  It indicates  a rate  somewhat below that of  the laterpart of last year, but part of  the&apos;large local stocks of flour accumulated during  thefirst two months of this  year has no  doubt passed into consumption,  and there is reason to believe that  the  rate of consumption is  increasing.   For the four weeks ended March 29th  the proportion of flour milled  in  the-United  Kingdom  to totalissues was  86.per cent., as compared with 72  per  cent, in the preceding four weeks and 79 per cent, a year before.    Fish. The following table illustrates weekly supplies of fish in March as corn-pared with the  first two months of the  year.

STOCKS.     The  stocks-of the principal foods and  feeding stuffs on  1st  April, are given inTable  D.  The principal food items show a continuation of the downward movementrecorded  during February.   In the  case of cereals, the decreases which amountedto 23 per cent, for wheat, 33 per  cent, for barley, and 35  per cent, for oats, are ofcourse largely seasonal, and that for meat (18  per cent.) still leaves very substantialstocks, especially  those  of  preserved meat,  which  actually show an  increase.  the arrival of  sugar from Java has hastened the  seasonal  recovery  of sugar stocks ascompared with recent years, and  the increases  in tea, coffee, and cocoa swell stocksalready abnormally large.   Generally, the position in comparison with recent years, asshown in the table given below, is favourable.   As regards the feeding stuffs position,it shows  an improvement  on recent  months, and also on  a year ago, but  does notcompare  so favourably with earlier years.

Retail prices on 1st April,  as recorded by the  Department of Labour Statistics-(Table E), show a further- fall; as compared with July 1914, the weighted  average,which showed  an increase of 120 per cent, on 3rd  March,  showed  an increase of113 per cent, on  1st  April.   As compared with prices on  3rd March,  there was practically no change  in bread,  meat,  sugar and butter.  Of seasonal  changes,  thefall in  the price of eggs (ll-^d. per dozen or 20&apos;7 per cent.)  was the most marked,milk falling only 0&quot; 7 per cent., while  there was a  slight tendency to higher prices for potatoes.  The other important changes were associated with Government action,either directly, as  in  the reduction of controlled prices of  cheese from  Is. Sd. toIs. Qd. per lb., or indirectly, as in  the case of  the decrease of lfd. per lb. or 13&apos;8  percent, for margarine, and that of i\d. per lb. or 4&quot;8 per cent, for tea.     Average wholesale prices for  March show  reductions in three important groupsas compared with the preceding month.  The reductions in the  flat rate for english and imported beef (133s.  to  121s. Id.  per  cwt.), and in that for mutton (140s. to128s. Id. per cwt.) were necessitated  by the lowering  of  the maximum  retail prices.British oats fell over 3 per cent., and  maize fell nearly  9 per cent.  Concurrently withan increase of stocks in the country, prices of  oilseeds  declined, the decrease being5 per cent, for linseed (Calcutta), 6 per cent, for  cottonseed (Egyptian), and  2 per cent.for palm kernels.   In no case was any appreciable increase uf price recorded.A 4
