S .00CU1TTT  IS TF&quot;  PRO?78?TY  OF  HIS BRI.T,OTIC ItAJPSTY^S GOVKNOT]?);. OR ?Tf7167aFAR  CABIN P &apos;1\AGRICULTURAL  LABOUR.MEMORANDUM  BY  THP1  STiCRPTA^Y  FOR  SdOTLAM),      THE CONCESSION WHICH THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR V&apos;AR WAS GOOD ENOUGH TO MAKE AND TO ANNOUNCE IN THE HOUSE ON THE 29TH APRIL WILL, I FEEL SURE, BE GENERALLY WELCOMED BY THE AGRIOUL- TURAL COMMUNITY IN SCOTLAND.   THE ARM OWN CEMENT WILL RELIEVE,A CRITICAL SITUATION, AND WILL PROVIDE A BREATHING SPACE IN WHICH TO CONSIDER THE MEASURES TO BE ADOPTED WITH REGARD TO AGRICULTURAL LABOUR.   1 SPENT THE RECESS IN SCOTLAND, AND FROM ALL SIDES RECEIVED STRONG REPRESENTATIONS TO THE EFFECT THAT THE PROPOSAL TO WITHDRAW FROM THE LAND A NUMBER OF THE MEN IN AGRICULTURAL COMPANIES AT THE END OF -APRIL OR THE BEGINNING OF MAY WOULD HAVE DISASTROUS EFFECTS UPON AGRICULTURE. IT WAS POINTED OUT TO ME THAT THE FARMERS WERE ENDEAVOURING TO GET THEIR SOWING DONE UNDER GREAT DIFFICULTIES IN A SEASON THAT IS ONE OF THE LATEST ON RECORD, AND THAT THE LOSS OF THIS LABOUR AT SUCH A TIME WOULD BE CALAMITOUS.      TO SECURE THE COMPLETION OF THIS PORTION OF THE FARMERS&apos; TASKS I HOPE THAT THE MEN IN AGRICULTURAL COMPANIES MAY BE LEFT UNDISTURBED IN SCOTLAND UNTIL THE &apos;HITSUNDAY TERM (28TH MAY) AND THAT AN EXTENSION OF TIME IN INDIVIDUAL CASES WILL BE CONSIDERED, IF SPECIAL REASONS ARE SHEWN TO EXIST.      IT IS FURTHER ESSENTIAL THAT THE DEMOBILIZATION OF MEN, WHEREVER SITUATED, WHO WERE APPROVED BY THE COMPETENT AUTHORITIES AS &quot;PIVOTAL&quot; BEFORE THE NEW SYSTEM WAS INTRODUCED, SHOULD BE EXPEDITED.   OWING DOUBTLESS TO DIFFICULTIES OF MACHINERY, MANY SUCH CASES ARE STILL OUTSTANDING, IN SPITE OF THE BEST EFFORTS OF ALL THE DEPARTMENTS CONCERNED TO TRACE AND RELEASE THE MEN.   WVEN AMONG THE AGRICULTURAL COMPANIES THERE ARE OVER 200 MEN WHOSE NAMES WERE SO APPROVED 3 MONTHS AGO.   IT WOULD BE A GREAT ADVANTAGE IF: ARRANGEMENTS COULD BE MADE TO DEMOBILIZE SUCH MEN ON THE SPOT, S,O AS TO SAVE LOSS OF TIME.      IN ADDITION TO THE MEN ABOVE MENTIONED, THERE ARE OTHERS WHOSE VALUE TO AGRICULTURE IS EXCEPTIONALLY HIGH, AND WHO COULD, IT IS BELIEVED, BE SELECTED FOR RELEASE WITHOUT CREATING ANY SERIOUS DIFFICULTY.   I SUGGEST THAT THE DEPARTMENTS CONCERNED COULD WORK OUT A SATISFACTORY SCHEME FOR THE SELECTION OF SUCH MEN *                                      (SIGNED)  ROBERT IOTR0;30TH APRIL, 1919.
