The prospective enlargement of the Department of Scientific   and Industrial Research, aealt with in a memorandum I have   recently submitted to the Cabinet, raises the important and   indeed  critical  question of scales of salary and superannuation   provision for the large staff of technical and scientific   Officers which the Department will have to employ.        burins the  past year the  salaries  of the  staff at the   National Physical Laboratory have been  revised by the Department    of Scientific and Industrial Research and the  salary scales-    of the  Geological Survey and  of the Meteorological Office will    also  need  revision  when they are  transferred.   If  other research    organisations such  as  the Medical Research Committee are trans-    ferreft  similar questions will arise.   But I  do not think it    wise  to deal  with so wide  a  range of  technical workers as  this    without regard to the scales attached to similar posts in  other    Government&apos;&quot;Departments.  This view is supported by the movements    taking place in more than one direction for  a systematic  treatment    of the subject.  The Institute of Chemistry has issued a    memorandum to Government Departments pleading for the establishment    of a Government Corps of Chemists with definite ranks and  scales    of salary attached to them while the seientific press is urging    the consideration of the whole position.3.         Before  I  sanctioned, new  scales for tho National Physical    laboratory I obtained  the  concurrence of my colleagues in the    spending  departments  to a&apos;proposal to ask the Prime Minister to    appoint a strong  committee to review the whole position, but    the  Chancellor of the Exchequer  thought the moment inopportune and.    I  abandoned  the idea.  Now, however, that the war  is over and. that    arrangements will have to  be  made to re-establish the services    of the Government upon a peace footing, it is important, I   ( think, that&quot;the salaries and  status of scientific and technical    officers  under Government  should receive oareful  consideration   \ without undue hurry.   It is certain that the establishment of a    Ministry  of  lealth, a Ministry of v/ays and Communications and. a    Ministry  of  jupply will bring into Government service a very much    larger staff of scientific and. technical officers than existed    before the war.  Moreover, the co-ordination of the general    scientific work of the Government under the Department of    Scientific and Industrial  Research and the development in the    amount of scientific  research which the war has shown to be    necessary in the national  interest and whioh is inevitable under    the  new economic and  administrative conditions with which we are    faced is  raising and  will  raise  shortly in an acute form the,    question  to  which I  am calling the attention of my colleagues. In     these changed circumstances I wish to revive the  suggestion which    I  placed  before them in the spring of 1918. 4*       The  terms of reference to the Committee should , I surest    be wide enough to include all men  of  Jcienec working in    Government employ whether chemists, physicists, phvsiologista     biologists,  engineers (including architects) or doctors  and to    allow the Committee to consider  how far it is desirable&apos;for    officers  of  this kind to  be pensionable Civil Servants.
5,        There remains the-question&apos;&apos; of the&apos;constitution of the     Committee,  It might no&apos; doubt be interdepartmental  in     character but in view of the important issues at&quot;stake     and the strong views held in the scientific; world with     regard to this question, it appears to mo preferable that     the Committee should in-the main consist of men of  standing     in the scientific, and possibly al30 the business;  world     together with one or two civil servants or ez-civil-servants   i  who would be able to assist the Committee to relate their     proposals to the existing practice of the Government as     regards their services.fSigned)  H.A.I.
