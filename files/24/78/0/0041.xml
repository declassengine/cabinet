PGHIBITION OK THE IMPORTATION OF POTATOES  -MEMORANDUM BY THE FOOD CONTROLLER The Ministry of Food is responsible for taking over the whole of the sound potatoes in Great Britain in 1918 and the whole of the exportable surplus from Ireland.   The Potato Crop is a very large one and thore is a considerable surplus beyond the quantity required for home consumption. Outlets are being found for part of the surplus in France, Germany, Belgium, Portugal and Scandinavia, but there will still be potatoes remaining at the end of the season for which the Ministry of Food will have to pay, unless some further steps can be taken to stimulate the consumption of home grown potatoes. One of the best ways of stimulating consumption would be to prohibit the import of new potatoes from Foreign countries. These potatoes which come mainly from Spain, France, and the Canary Islands, usually begin to arrive in England in the middle of April and during Hay the import of these potatoes has a very considerable effect on the consumption of old potatoes,  I understand that under an International agreement French produce is entitled to admission into this country in spite of any prohibition of imports, but even if a prohibition is effective to prevent the admission of potatoes only from Spain and the Canary Islands I am of opinion that a further 30,000 tons of home grown potatoes will be consumed, and this will save the Exchequer from a loss amounting to at least  250,000,  Moreover, the prohibition of import from Spain and the Canary Islands would tend to improve our Exchange in those countries. In view of the fact that there is a big surplus of potatoes in this country it is obviously uneconomical that potatoes should be imported from foreign countries and I accordingly ask that a prohibition may be immediately placed upon their importation from foreign countries.  The proposal has been discussed with the Board of Trade Department of Import. Restrictions who take the view that thoy should not imposeif the desired prohibition without express instructions from the[ War Cabinet.GSO. H, ROBERTS.Ministry of Food.  24th April 1919.
