The sowing of oats and planting of potatoes aro  still in progress, and should be well forward in the course pf a  week  uv ten days.   Preparations for the sowing, of root crops are well  advnaoed in early districts,  :Wintor and early sown  spring wheat  13 continuing to make satisfactory progress.   Owing to the cold  weather grass has not yet made much growth,                           LABOUR.

            The Departmentfs Advisory Committoo or Flax-Growingheld, its thirty-sixth meeting at the City Hall, Belfast, onFriday, 25th April,  1919,            Tho Committee had under consideration            (1) A ropcrt on the Department&apos;s operations inconnection with various Orders, oto*, affecting tho flax crop,            (2) The supply cf seod for sowing in 1920,            (3) Proposals regarding futuro arrangements for tholicensing of scutchrailla in Ireland,            (4) Request3 from farmers associations, etc. forfurther representation of farming interests on the Flax SuppliesCommittee,            (5) Complaints regarding the grading eff flax.            The Department have recommended that the Governmentshruld hold  over until the autumn, at least the best portion ofthe need which will remain unsold at the ond of the present sowingseason,   It is considered that the supplies of now seed which maybe obtained for next season from Kngland, Canada and Japan will bemore than sufficient for Irish requirements.   The holding over of seed is recommended as a safeguard and with a view to keeping downtho prices of new  seed,,Seed Solootien.     Last year an area  of about 5-J acres of flaxwas grown at Ballinacurrn, Co* Cork from two linos of flaxsoedr.-&apos;isod from single plants from whioh 2PJt cvrfcs. pf seed were produced...   A marked feature of the crop from both lines  was theiriiifcrm character,  length and bulk of the flax straw.  No com-parutivo tests have yet been made an to the scutching quality of theflax straw but a bulk experiment is now in progress.           For tho purpose of propagating supplies of these seeds10 acres are being grown this year.           In addition,experiments arc boing conducted at fivecentres this year in which&apos;the selected&apos;varieties will be comparedwith standard varieties commonly grown and six further tests of theselections are being  conducted by flax Instructors in  CountiesDonegal, Down, Londonderry, kionaghan and Tyrone.           For the pnrposo of carrying out change of seedoxporimentn, arrangements have been made for  sowing about 2 statuteacres  each with those varieties of  good in British East Africa,Franco. Canada (Ontario), England and Scotland.  It is intended thatportion of the seed grown in those  countries will bo returned  toIreland whero they will be tested in field trials in  1920,  Fournew selections of  seed are being grown in  the  Departments gardenplots  at Eallinacurra, Oo, Cork, this year.           The work of propagating  improved and pure  strains  of flax Is being continued&quot;and  extended both  by making selections-fr&apos;m single plants and by hybridiaaticnP
           A number of hybrids havo already been raised and willIbe increased, in bulk this year preparatory  to having them sub-fnitted to field tests at an early date.           The question of drying flaxsoed artificially is receivingJfurthor attontion.   Tho experiments conducted up to date show[that artificial drying is distinctly advantageous and enhances  the keeping quality of the seed,JFlax Experiments  (Floldn Trials) 1919.
