(War Cabinet. 558). that the NationalRiflaFactory, Garrison Lane, Birmingham, should be handedover to the Training Department of the Ministry ofLabour, for use as a training centre for disabled soldiers, I wish to circulate, for the information ofthe War Cabinet, a. copy of a minute whioh I havereceived from Sir Howard Frank, and also a copy ofa resolution which has been forwarded to me on theuart of the Disposal Board, of the Ministry ofMunitions*4,..4.19.I.-eOc-
 Tho Minister.             JL9.!..-iLRifle Factory. Garrison lane,                      BIRMINGHAM.           I went  to Wo, 10 Downing Street on Thursday but found the Cabinet Meeting had ended earlier than m&amp; anticipated, and  I have since heard that the War Cabinet. decided that the  Garrison Lane Factory is to be handed over to the Ministry of Labour for the training of &amp;is- abled soldiers.           As the  views of the Ministry were not heard, you will probably think it advisable to ask the War Cabinet to reconsider their decision, otherwise I fear there will be vory considerable public criticism, and not without justification.           It was  decided some three months ago to dispose of this factory.  It has been freely advertised throughout the Press for the past two months, and the tenders are being opened on the 30th instant.           Wo less than 91 firms have applied, for forms of tender, apart from a largo number of applications of a general character.           This particular factory is very  saleable as it is of a type which is needed for various trades, in fact I think there is  little doubt that I should be able to dispose of the property for more than the sum at whioh it has been valued.           It is clear that there is urgent need of factorie for commercial purposes,while there are only a few, com- paratively speaking, for disposal, some of which are un- suitable for ordinary trade,
           I venture to suggest  that  the Dudley factory oouiaf .  - have  been utilised tor the  training  of disabled soldiers. This  factory is difficult to.dispose oi.   The floor  area  is 240,570.feet super,  against 44,000 feet super  at  Garrison Lane.   It is only eight  miles from Birmingham,  with a good local service,  and although  It is at  the top of  a hill  the  trams run from  tho  Station to  within  600  yards,  and  the  incline  iron the tramway terminus to  the factory  is but  slights &apos;           When  I met.the Mayor  of Birmingham and  the  Minister of  Labour in the latter room,  the  Major  said  that Dudley was not the  slightest  use,  having in his mind  of  course Garrison  Lane which  he badly wanted, and being  obviously ^re- pared to  urge at all costs  upon the  Minister of Labour that Garrison  Lane was the  one and only place for the  purpose and that it. should  be  handed over for disabled  soldiers at once.           It  is  clear  that  Dudley is not so desirable, but the means  of access  are  fairly  convenient aid I cannot believe the difficulties referred to  are insuperable.           In any event I am satisfied  that  if Garrison Lane is  now withdrawn from  the market it will create grave distrust of  the Disposal  Board  just  at the time when we are doing our utmost to  gain the confidence of the public and to convince them that  they are being treated in a  businesslike way,           Several  of the firms  interested have had the factory and also the machinery valued at considerable expense, ^nd itwill give  rise to  a  great c..eal  of adverse comment if, after inviting the public  to tender end after  having; the Conditionsdrawn up by the  Treasury Solicitor,  we decline at the last.moment to  entertain  any  offers,  as it may well be asked why the Government did not discover sooner that the factory was likely to  be required  for the training of disabled soldiers.           It is  also clear  that if there are anything approach^. ing 300,000 soldiers to be  trained in  factories,  the total .   .number we have for disposal will be  insufficient  to accemrao&amp;ate
them, so that in view ox the War Cabinet Minute I mustregard, every one of these factories as out of the market,whereas we are advertising several for disposal, some&quot;by auction and others by public tender.        .. The general question of the training of disabledsoldiors Is of course a largo one with&apos;which others are more closely conversant than myself,          I understand the Trades Unions are raising ob-Sections to soldiers.being trained in- existing factories.It would, however, appear inevitable that to train 300,000,soldiers in Government factories will not merely cost thecountry many millions which will never be regainec, but will result in a long postponement of.the date when these premises,specially built as factories and suitable for commercial purposes, can be devoted to industry, and. it is industry that we want to foster am&apos; encourage.
