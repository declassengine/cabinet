                                             28th April  1919.SALARIES OP SOTKNTIPIC &apos;W TECHNICAL OFFICERS            m THE QQVE&amp;MEHT SERVICE.               MX   H* &quot;** i?.&apos; t - ci in W x *.( .,4-Admiralty Memorandum-for the War Cabinet.          The proposal of the President of the Board of  education to appoint a Committee to consider the salaries  of  scientific and Technical Officers in the Government Service (G.T.7108)is of considerable interest to the Admiralty, not only becauseof tho proposal to develop a Naval Research Institution  and experimental Station, but also because in various servicesthey have employed Scientific Officers, the fixing  of whosescales of salaries have given rise to difficulty.          Instances of the offloors to whom I refer are  as follows:            The Professors on the Staff of the R-N.College,                                                Greenwich.            The Astronomer Royal and the Ro al Observatory Staff.            Tho Cape Astronomer and the Cape Observatory Staff.            The Admiralty Shemist and his staff.            The Superintendent of the Admiralty  Experiment Works;                Haslar and his Staffjand various Scientific Experts attached to the  &quot;Vernon*Mining School, etc*                                        *          The Admiralty therefore are in full agreement  with thePresident of the Board of Education as to the desirability  ofthe proposed inquiry, to which they attach the  greatest  importance.          It is observed that the Memorandum docs not limit  the inquiry to the salaries and status of Scientific Officers, butthat Technical Officers are also included.   A  very largo numberof Officers employed by the Admiralty, e.g., the Royal Corps ofNaval Constructors, the Electrical Engineers and the CivilEngineers and Surveyors, might be held to be included in this category,  and it would seem desirable that the  scope of the inquiry should bo more precisely defined. &apos;          I am not convinced that a Committee composed as suggested in Mr-.Fisherrs last paragraph would be the mostsuitable to doal with the salaries of members of well definedprofessions such as these.          If therefore, as I hope, the proposed inquiryis agreed to, Is hould be glad of an  opportunity of remarkingon the composition of the Committee and the Terms  of Referencebefore these are finally settled^,(Signed) .    VI. H.  LONG.28th April, 1919.
