ORDER OF  THIS BRITISH EHPIRE.OIVIL DIVISION  .5?All(Circulated by the Home  Seoretary)./      A question on which I should behind&apos;to have  the  dooision  *f the cabinet has arisen as to the next list of appoirrt-itwftts to the Order  of the BritishEmpire, which is to be issued on,the conclusion of  Peace  and is  to be thefinal list for services in oonneotion with  the War,   As  the list is to be tholast, it is necessary that it should satisfy, so far as possible, all outstandingclaims to recognition in respect of such services;  and in order to ascertain what these claims were all the Departments  have been asked to submit estimates of their probable requirements.   A summary of these estimates is annexed, fromwhich it will be seen that the demands reaoh a total in the  three- lower classesof nearly 9,000.      These estimates have been considered  by the Advisory Committee oinsistingof tho Permanent Heads of Departments.   It is olear that the number will re-quire some revision.   The claim of the Pensions Department, for instance, to1,980 places is oertainly excessive:  and those of  the  Ministry  of Munitions,1,073, and the Red Cross, 1,055 (in addition to 932 and 910  places alreadygranted) are very high.   On the other hand, the Foreign  Office  say their estimate is teo low, and the Soottish and Irish Offioes have been unable tosubmit any estimate.should be included in tho Gazette.    On the  question whether the total numbershould be substantially reduced,  the  opinion of the Committee was divided.It was agreed that a substantial  reduction, of the  total would mean tha ex-clusion of many deserving candidates, and that there would  be strong pressure from the Departments for further  grantsl   it was agreed on  the  other hand thatthe addition of anything like  9,000  names  to the Order would tend to cheapenthe distinction and would be the subject  :&apos;.of press  oritioism.   While, however,some members thought that a Gazette containing 9,000  names  in the three lowerclasses would finally destroy the reputation of tho Order,  and  that the numberof appointments in the next Gazette should  in no circumstances  exceed, say,,3,000, the majority took the view that the  Order was  undoubtedly intended tocover all olasses of society and all  kinds  of public  service; that it must therefore necessarily be widely distributed; and that it  would  be unfair to alarge number of persons whcse services deserved recognition to  restrict thescope of the Order at this stage and  thus raise the standard substantially above      Before attempting any allocation of  numbers  on the  basis of these claims,the Advisory Committee have asked for guidance  as  to the  total number that* In addition to this,  there is the  Military Division  of  the Order the recommenda-tions for whioh are made by the Admiralty,  War  Office, and Air Ministry.
 that hitherto observed.    They thought that  a  Gazette  containing 3,000 names would probably meet with quite as muoh criticism as  cne  containing&apos; 9,000, and in addition would cause great difficulty to all the Departments in making their recommendations,  besides giving rise te a  widespread feeling that recognition had not  been consistently or  justly bestowed.       On the whole,  I am disposed to agree with the latter view - but I should bo glad to have tho decision of the Cabinet on  the  two  ftl+orwi- tivesst       (l) lo make the final li3t  large enough   to meet all reasonable^olaimsf which would mean a total  of at least 8,000; ar       (2) 1* restrict tho list to a comparatively small number, say, not jaoro than 3,000.       If the latter course is adopted, it would be well to have a small Cabinet Committee to allocate the numbers, sb  it is difficult for  a Committee consisting of  heads of  Departments to aut down eath  other&apos;s claims i       The number of the  First Class (G.B.E.) and Seoond Class  (K.B.E. and D.B.E.) should also be deoided as there is likely to be strong pressure especially for the seoond class.    There have  already  been appointed 57 G.B,E&apos;s and 240 K.B.E&apos;s  (including D.B.E.s).       It is necessary that preparations for  the &quot;final  Gazette  should bo begun at once, and I should therefore be glad  tf an early dooision in the matter.
