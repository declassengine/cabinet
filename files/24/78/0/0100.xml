I circulate this memorandum by

General Seely, and would beg for the earliest possible consideration; the matter is really urgent.

(Intld.) W.S.C.
          At a Meeting of the Cabinet held on the 15th of Aprila proposal was brought up by the Under Secretary of State for air on the lines of the attached memorandum.  It was understood bythe representatives of the Air Ministry who attended the meeting that approval had been given for the recruitment of 10,000 menas a preliminary measure and pending ultimate decision as to theconstitution of the Air Force; and also for the enrolment of3,500 officers on temporary engagements varying from 2-5 years in addition to the award of 1,500 permanent commissions whichhad already been sanctioned.         .  The Air Ministry was however notified the next day byCabinot Minute that the sanction for the enrolment of 3,500 officers on temporary engagements was not included in the Cabinet decision.          The need for these officers is definite and urgentfor the reason that when the date of the termination of theY/ar is reached, there will remain no power to hold officers inexcess of the 1,500 who will have been awarded permanent commisions, and who are entirely inadequate in numbers to therequirements of the Force.          The total number of officers required is 5,500 whichfigure is based on the considered establishments for the after-the-war Air Force, the strength of which has been agreed to.  Thereason why so many officers are to be retained on temporaryengagements Is that they are required only until&apos; the officers forthe future Air Force have been entered and trained.  The permanent commisions are limited to 1,500 in order to restrict thepermanent list to permanent requirements, that is to say, to avoidentering more officers on a long service basis than it ispossible to offer a permanent career toj  the commitments and pension liability will thereby be reduced.          It may be that the Cabinet will reduce the total strengthof the Air Force to a standard below that which was contemplatedwhen framing these figures.  If that should prove to be tho case,the position can be easily met by the enrolment of temporary officers being adjusted for suitable periods varying from one yearto 4 years.          It will be seen then that the figures and the scheme havebeen carefully considered from the economic point of view end fromthe point of view of providing for possible changes of policy, andthey are the minimum required.  If thoy arc refused the Air force must cease to be able to operate.  If sanction is delayed the eventual cost must be heavier and the risk increased because weshould have lost the services of trained and experienced officofewho-*ill come in now, but &quot;will not wait indefinitely for our proposals.  Already many are accepting engagements in civil life.          The Cabinet do not appear to appreciate the fact that theAir Force, unliko the Army or Navy have had hitherto nopermanently commissioned officers and consequently aro now facedwith the problem of creating above an Air Force on a permanent and economical basis.                          (Int.)  J.S.5.5.19.
IMMEDIATE FUTURE REQUIREMENTS IN PERSONNEL OF R.A.F          We have now reached a point when it is imperative toenrol officers and other ranks to meet the requirements of theimmediate future of the Air Force,          The reason for our urgent necessity is that whereas ourrequired strength after the Army of Occupation period will be5,500 officers and 55,000 men, we shall only have available,500 officers and 14,000 men.          The reason for these deficiencies is, as regards officers,the fact that the difference between 1,500 (the maximum number ofpermanent commissions to be awarded) and,5,500 (the total numberof officers required) must be made up by an immediate enrolmentfor temporary service of 2,500 - 3,500 officers.   If we canpronounce our requirements now we shall, we know, get many of thedemobilising officers to rejoin for temporary service of 3-5 years *          Similarly as regards other ranks, the difference (40,000)between the number loft after the Army of Occupation period(14,000) and the number required (55,000) will be met as follows          10,000 by boys now being entered.          30,000 by men it Is hoped to recruit this year.          If we can start recruiting at once we shall, we know,get many of the trained men lately demobilised to return and save the cost of training raw recruits.          But as regards both officers and men we cannot attemptto enrol them unless we are able at the same time to promulgatethe terms of service as regards pay, etc.          Tho only course in the circumstances, therefore, Is toarrive at somo provisional settlement as will enable us to beginrecruiting and tide us over this crisis.
