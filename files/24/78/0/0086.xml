PART I.-ORGANISATION AMONG CLERICAL,  SUPERVISORY, AND MANAGERIAL                                   EMPLOYEES.    One of  the most noticeable  of  recent developments connected with  organisationamong bodies of producers is the extension of organisation of the trade union type amongworkers of the classes not hitherto affected by the trade  union movement.   From an industrial point of view,  the most  significant aspect of this development is the importantadvance which has  recently been  made in the work of organising clerical, supervisory,managerial, and technical grades of workers ; and an examination of this activity revealsa number of  features of  considerable interest, and  opens up  considerations of greatimportance.    It is pretty clear that organisation among these grades of workers becomes effective without anything like the struggles experienced by the older trade  unions.   On general grounds, as well as on special grounds to which reference will be made later, this is what might be expected.  The people here  concerned are in the main educated and intelligent,and capable of taking a longer view than is the case with many classes of manual workers.Thus, once organised, their organisation tends to be strong,  backed  as it is in the moralsphere by a reasoned solidarity, and in the practical sphere by  the comparatively high rate  of remuneration received by  many classes of its members.  It  has been  frequentlyobserved hitherto that instability of membership, as apart from actual size of membership,tends to be  much greater  in unions composed of low-paid general labourers than is thecase  with the more highly  skilled or remunerated types.   (C 1768) 150  5/19  H k S
    The only difficulty hitherto has been to get these classes to organise, that is, to getthe individuals composing them to exchange the prospect which  he has, or believes hehas, of gain by outstripping his fellows, for the prospect which he shares with others ofgaining better conditions for all by means of common action.  The difficulty here pre-sented, of course, is in direct ratio to the possibilities which lie open to a particularly alertindividual, and it is the comparatively large opportunity of rising that lies open to the classes referred to, or the comparatively high individual position which they have alreadyattained, that has in the past constituted the greatest obstacle to  organisation.    But the peculiar conditions created by the war would appear to have had a strong-effect in breaking down obstacles to organisation, and organisation once begun, the stateof affairs left behind by the war bids fair to encourage its continuance and development.During  the war many grades of manual workers, by reason of their organisation, wereenabled to take advantage of economic conditions to increase their remuneration so asto. make it keep pace, at any rate approximately, with the rapidly changing conditions.This was, to the special grades referred to, not only an example of the advantages of organisation, but a very great inducement towards common action of a drastic nature,since the  supervisory, technical, and clerical grades found themselves being left behindby manual workers who were their inferiors in training and  education as well as in con-conventional standard of living.   This has evidently been the most effective factor operatinghitherto, and it is probably true to say that increase in remuneration and betterment of conditions are at present the main considerations with their  various organisations.    But once  created,  these organisations of managerial,  technical, and  supervisorygrades have  found themselves faced  with opportunities which they have not been slow to realise, and which give them their peculiar importance at the  moment.  They have entered the field just at the time when the question of industrial control is more prominentthan ever before.  The  well-organised  grades  of manual workers are  pressing forward the question of control, not only of conditions of work, but of industry itself, and in thisconflict of interest between worker  and employer, the managerial and supervisory gradesfind themselves in something of a  key position.   Hitherto they  have in general been regarded as representing the  employer,  and they are  of course indispensable to him.  Atthe same time, without their assistance  manual workers cannot claim alone.to representall grades in the  industry, whereas with their assistance their claim for entire control isenormously strengthened and its object  brought within the bounds of possibility.    Signs are not Avanting, though things have not  got to an acute stage on a large scaleyet, that these considerations are beginning to be of practical  importance.  Thus inJanuary, the Northern Colliery Officials&apos; Association threatened to strike against the attitudeof the employers who  were withholding recognition, on  the ground that the  officials&quot; represent the employer  and therefore  cannot be allowed a separate identity.&quot;  Thequestion of recognition again has come up in connection with the Association of engineering and Shipbuilding Draughtsmen, one  of the most recent, most successful, and most pro-gressive  organisations of  technical  workers.   This  society  has  connections  with theNational Guilds League,  has voted against the application of the Whitley Report to theirindustry,  and has registered a decision to withdraw all connection with the EmploymentExchanges and to control its own  labour supply, as a first  step towards the control ofindustrial conditions by the workers.  Probably this attitude of the  society has beenfostered&apos; by the hostile attitude of the employers ;  and a number of other instances have occurred already  in which the employers have been  placed in  the dilemma of either recog-recognising a society to which they did not wish to allow a &quot; separate identity &apos;&quot; from themselves,or seeing the society join forces against them with the manual workers.  The Retail CoalClerks&apos;  Association, which covers principally depot and wharf managers,  has recentlybecome affiliated to the Coal Porters&apos; Union in opposition to  the Coal Merchants&apos; Society,who wished  them to become affiliated to the  N.U.C.  In the baking trade the BakeryManagers&apos; Association has recently decided to become affiliated to the National Unionof Operative Bakers.  Perhaps  the  most notorious other case at the moment, which isof some interest in this connection, is that of the Railway Clerks&apos; Association, who haverecently been granted recognition as representing supervisory grades.     These are  typical isolated  instances of the new developments, in connection withsupervisory and technical workers,  but  the whole question is tending to become focussedmore and more, at any rate over a wide industrial field, by the question of the applicationof the Whitley Report.  With this problem before  an industry, the question passes fromthe domain of abstract interests to  that of practical affairs,  and becomes the question asto what representation, if any, these grades are to have on  the Whitley Council.  here again the matter has not yet reached an acute stage in general, but in one or two cases
it lias assumed considerable importance.  Perhaps the most important case is that ofGovernment industrial establishments, with regard to which  varying opinions have been expressed.  Some authorities have expressed the opinion that the representation of super-visory grades as such at all on industrial councils will be seriously subversive of discipline,while on the other side the  opinion has been expressed that supervisory  and technicalgrades should possess one-third of the representation.  In connection with the ChemicalTrades, the industrial chemists have been refused representation on the industrial council,presumably  owing to the  employers&apos; objection to &quot; separate identity.&quot;  In connectionwith the Electricity Supply Council a position of some interest has arisen over the electrical power Engineers&apos; Association. The power engineers, who are technical workers, claimseparate representation, but this is strongly opposed by the Electrical Trades Union, whocove? a certain  number of power engineers mostly those who have risen from the ranks- and claim to represent them along with other workers.  The matter has not yet come before the Council or been considered by the employers, but the attitude of the latter will be  of interest.   If they support the E.P.E.A. they will be acceding that &quot; separateidentity &quot; to which  in so many cases employers  are bitterly opposed, whereas if  theysupport the E.T.U.  they may throw the E.P.E.A. into the  arms of  the E.T.U. andcombine the technical workers with the manual workers as a solid body on the other sideof the table.                   PART II. DEMOBILISATION AND RESETTLEMENT. The Resettlement of Ex-Officers.     The most important recent development in connection with the resettlement of ex- officers is probably the establishment throughout the country of a system of District Selective Committees associated with the Department in the administration of the Maintenance and Training Grants Scheme.  During the past week, this system,  which for some time has been in partial operation, reached the stage at which it may be regarded as complete.     The special importance of these Committees arises in  connection with the provision of professional and  business training,  with which the Ministry  of Labour is more closely concerned  than with academic -or  agricultural  training.  Upon training  opportunities of this kind much depends.  They oiler attractions to large  numbers of ex-officers who are unwilling or unable to undergo the more formal training of  ordinary academic type ; and it is hoped that they will resolve  the doubts of commercial and industrial employers as to the capacity of the demobilised  officer.     For the proper development of this &quot; training vacancy &quot; system, it has been felt neces- sary to obtain skilled advice,  both for the guidance of candidates and as a safeguard to the Department in its administration of public funds.  Accordingly the District Selective Committee have been set up, composed entirely of representatives of the more important professional and learned societies, together with prominent  professional  and  business men of the area covered  by each  committee.  Upon these committees the selection and approval of candidates depend in the first place.   Their primary functions  are (1) to see that candidates  are  directed to openings of the type for which they appear best fitted;, and (2) to make recommendations for maintenance and training grants in approved  cases for the consideration of the Central Grants Committee.     The Selective Committees have power  to set up such  Interviewing Boards,  drawing for them in the main on their own members, but  strengthening them when desirable by the co-option of other members with special topical or local knowledge.   The proceduregenerally adopted is to set up in a district one or more general Interviewing Boards to deal in particular with the numerous cases in which the candidate, while desiring training of.some description, is  uncertain as to the exact vocation  best fitted to his wishes and his capacity.   These general  Boards are supplemented by  special  Interviewing  Boards for particular industries or professions.  Thus  the  Cambridge  District  Selective Committeehave appointed Interviewing Boards for engineering, accountancy and law, chemistry andpharmacy,  architecture  and surveying, commerce, and veterinary science.  In Belfastspecial Interviewing Boards are at work for shipbuilding and engineering, textile manu-facture, accountancy, and general business.    Over 700 business and professional men have placed their services at the disposalof the  Department  for this work.  The list includes representatives of the Chambers  ofCommerce  of the United Kingdom, the Federation of British  Industries,  the Institute
 of Civil Engineers, the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, the Institution of of Electrical Engineers, the Institution of Mining and Metallurgy, the Royal Institute of British architectural- tects, the Surveyors&apos; Institution, the  chief Law Societies of England and Scotland, and other bodies.   The professional experience thus available  may be extended almost in- definitely by the co-option of further members.     It is not intended to restrict these bodies to the comparatively narrow duty of advising and selecting candidates for training, and recommending maintenance and training grants. The District Selective Committees also examine and approve the training vacancies placed by various firms at the disposal of the Department, thus providing some assurance both to  the candidate  and to the  Department  that  the training  ground  thrown  open  is suitable for the purpose for which it is intended.  They have also been asked to interview and advise candidates who wish to secure appointments without going through a period of training.  Here they will act, not merely for the demobilised officer, but also for civilians who avail themselves of the opportunity offered by the Department.  But for young andinexperienced officers or those whose professional careers have been interrupted at an early stage, the main value of the committees  will lie in the assistance which they can affordin securing the necessary training.         PART III.-PRESS COMMENTS.        (I) Labour and Socialist Press.(Ay-:The Peace Conference and Foreign Affairs.     The discussions on Foreign Affairs in the Labour Press this week are mainly upon twotopics, the withdrawal of the Italian delegation and the adoption by the Conference in its final form of the Covenant of the League of Nations.Italy and Fiume.     The &quot; Democrat &quot; (a new Labour paper, replacing the old &quot; Federationist,&quot; edited bythe  Secretary of the General Federation,of Trade Unions) regards the breach which hasoccurred in Paris between Signor Orlando and President Wilson as unfortunate.  &quot; In theinterests of peace &quot; it continues &quot; it is to be hoped that those who know least will sayleast about the whole situation.&quot;  It concludes by commending to its readers &quot; the beautyand profound philosophy of Orlando&apos;s statement.&quot;  &quot; The British Citizen &quot; in an articleunder the  title &quot; Mr. Wilson butts in,&quot; explains  and defends  the Italian withdrawal,and suggests that the case of Fiume is analogous to that of  Danzig  and  should  besettled on similar lines.   &quot; The first duty of Great Britain and France is to be true to Italy.&quot;The &quot; Cotton Factory Times &quot; thinks that the only just and safe solution of the problem is the application of President Wilson&apos;s points, &quot; in which he is firmly backed by organised labour in two hemispheres.&quot;     The remainder of the papers which deal with this topic do so in order to point a moral.Mr.  Ramsay Macdonald in the &quot; Forward &quot; says that he &quot; has always been against theItalian claims.&quot; He thinks we have followed the path of wisdom but not of honour, andexclaims, &quot; Oh, the dishonesty and the hypocrisy of it all.&quot;  &quot; The  Clarion &quot; criticisesItaly for not realising that a new age has been born,  and  warns her not  to rape Fiume.But it says the temper of Italy since the Armistice is due to  the  Allies  quite as much&apos; asto Italy ;  and the moral it points is that when the Pact of London was  made &quot; the BritishGovernment had not one man of strategic brain among them.&quot;  In the  &quot; Labour Leader,&quot;Mr. E. D. Morel, in an article with the title &quot; Exposed at Last,&quot; contrasts what he calls thenoble and  magnanimous professions of  the  English and Allied Governments with their&quot; predatory aims &quot; which he  outlines in detail.  The &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot; neverthought that Italy had the least, justification to annex Fiume, but asks &quot; Why has Wilsonchosen to apply his fourteen points which nowhere else are applied to the Port ofFiume.&quot;The League of Nations.     The  Covenant of the League of Nations and its adoption by the Peace Conference is discussed by some of  the papers in a similar fashion.  The &quot; Democrat&quot; welcomes theLeague of Nations as  a  means to  the revival of the ancient nations of the Middle East.
The &quot; Cotton -Factory Times &quot;  rejoices over the definite establishment of  the  League,&quot; which has opened the prospect on a true brotherhood of nations, and has brought with it the International Labour  Charter.&quot;  The  &quot; Clarion &quot;  congratulates President Wilsonon the  achievement of the League, and is &quot; more hopeful than most newspapers writersas to its pacifist possibilities &quot; ;  but it cannot regard the Covenant of the League as the death warrant of war.   &quot; It will be well, while implicitly trusting the League of Nations,at the same time to keep our powder dry.&quot;  The &quot; Call &quot; dismisses the whole Conference&quot; as the most complete and cynical agent for shattering  social idealism that history has yet seen &quot;;  which phraseology is echoed in the  &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot; and by acontributor to the &quot; Bradford Pioneer.&quot;Russia.    The &quot; Democrat &quot; and the  &quot;  Workers&apos; Dreadnought &quot; continue their serials-fromopposing  points of view on  Russian Bolshevism.  The &quot; British Citizen &quot; calls uponthe Allied Powers (in particular England and  America) to stamp  out Bolshevism (thoughonly by means of Russian man-power).The International.    &quot; Justice &quot; reports the Congress of  the French Socialist Party  and regrets that the motion  to adhere unreservedly to the Second International (that of Berne) was defeated ;while the  &quot; Call&quot;  rejoices in the reservations with which it was decided to  continue to adhere  to  the Socialist International Bureau.  In a noteworthy article in &quot; Justice,&quot;Mr. Hyndman summons  socialists  from  the pursuit of the old ideals of internationalism(which he regards as, for the time being, wholly unrealisable because of the German Socialistbetrayal in 1914) to the good work of achieving some of their aims here in England.                                (B) Home Affairs.Labour Policy.    Mr. Ramsay macdonald and Mr. F. W. Jowett continue in the &quot; Forward &quot; and the&quot; Pioneers &quot; (of Bradford and of Merthyr Tydfil) respectively, the discussion on &quot; Forms ofGovernment&quot; which is alleged to have been spoilt at the I.L.P. Conference at Hudders-field, firstly by the withdrawal of the &quot; Soviet &quot; resolution, and secondly by the shelving.of the Bradford Resolution in favour of the substitution of the Cabinet system by a systemof Parliamentary Committees.   Mr Macdonald thinks that the I.L.P. still falls short  ofa proper realisation of the true meaning of representative Democracy.    It may be added here that a constant note in the &quot; May Day &quot; articles in the more&quot; constitutional &quot; of  these papers is one of disappointment in the failure  of the workers.at the  last General Election to use their &quot; overwhelming political power &quot;  effectively.Unemployment Donation.    The &quot; Democrat &quot; emphasizes the failure of the Labour Exchanges to provide employ-ment, complains of a widespread abuse of the donation, and calls for the  institution of asystem whereby every person in receipt of benefit should be made &quot;to earn it by work on public  utility undertakings.    The &quot; Cotton Factory Times &quot; would take the administration of the donation out ofthe Employment Exchanges and put it into the hands of the associations of employersand the trade unions.   On the other hand, Lieut.-Colonel W. Thorne in &quot; Justice &quot; defends,on  political grounds, the  action of the Government in  instituting the benefit, and the&quot; Yorkshire Factory Times &quot; confines itself to  giving useful  technical advice to textileworkers who may have to appear before a Court of Referees.Profit-Sharing and Go-Partnership.    The &quot; Yorkshire Factory Times &quot; quotes with approval an exposure by an AmericanLabour Leader of Profit-Sharing schemes as anti-unionist manoeuvres.  On the other hand,Lieutenant S. Howard Withey in the &quot; British Citizen &quot; maintains that the permanent solution of labour unrest is to be found in  better conditions of work together with thelegislative application of  the  Profit-sharing and Co-partnership  principle to all industrial.concerns.   He urges that the possible  reduction of the Excess Profits tax provides anopportunity for this legislative action.  His proposals for limited companies in this respect
are : Every employee to take up one 10 per cent. Preference Share, preferably cumulative,in a concern, and the allocation of half the remaining divisible profits to a bonus on wages for all employees.Unofficial Strikes.    &quot; Forward &quot; reports as a defeat the substitution at the Scottish Trade Union Congressfor Bailie Climie (of the Workers&apos; Union) (who  defended the Parliamentary Committeein its associating itself with the Clyde strike) of Mr. James Walker (British SteelsmeltersUnion), who attacked the  committee on this point, as a member of  the  parliamentary committee of  the  Congress.  The &quot; Yorkshire Factory  Times &quot; hopes that unconstitu-tional strikes will take place as infrequently as possible,  and insists very  definitely thatthere can be no strike pay for them.  On this matter of strikes it is  interesting to notethatMr. George Lansbury at Merthyr Tydfil and Israel Zangwill in the &quot; Call &quot; both expresslack of faith in the Triple Alliance in particular and in the working-class  as a  whole, becausewhile they may  be willing enough to strike for money and wages, they are not willing todo so for any impersonal principle.Non-Unionism.    The &quot; Yorkshire Factory Times &quot; calls upon all textile employers to follow the example of the Bradford Dyers&apos; Association, and use moral pressure to make all their employeesbecome members of Trade Unions, and regrets the failure of the Industrial Council of thetrade to settle the matter immediately.The &quot; Restoration &quot; Bill.    The Merthyr  Tydfil &quot;Pioneer&quot; approves  of the comprehensive character  of this bill, but criticises (1)  the fact that the Bill  does not come into operation  until after the&quot; end of the war &quot; ;  (2) the procedure laid down for securing restoration, which it claimsadmits of long delay.Local Authorities Elections.    The &quot; Forward &quot; and the &quot; Labour Leader &quot;are jubilant on account of the successeswhich have been gained by Labour Candidates in the recent Boards of Guardian and other local  elections.  In particular, the &quot; Forward &quot; also  prints an article from a Catholicsource on the alliance in Scotland, especially in the elections to the School Boards, betweenthe Labour Party and the Irish Catholics.Other Matters.    Contributed articles to  &quot; Justice &quot; on the future of the Cotton Industry,  to &quot; Forward &quot;on the ownership  of Mines in Scotland (and &quot; the act of  1592 &quot;), and to the &quot;  BritishCitizen &quot; on the &quot; Japanese Trade Boom &quot; and on &quot; The Miners&apos; Charter &quot; may be noted.                (2)  The Daily Press on Demobilisation and Resettlement.Out-of-Work Donation.    Comment upon  the out-of-work donation was  general throughout the press  on the30th  April as a  result of the debate in the House.  Agreement as to the necessity of thescheme was almost  unanimous,  the 11 Morning  Post&quot; being  the  most conspicuousexception.  There was a general expression  of opinion that the number of cases of abuse of the system had been considerably exaggerated.  The chief criticism levelled  againstthe Government was that its policy in regard to  industry was obscure  and  uncertain.Unemployment in  Glasgow.    A correspondent of the &quot; Daily Herald &quot; (5th May) writes :     &quot; There will be more rebels still if the Coalition continues  to flirt with profiteering         while regarding with contempt the claims  of the poor for remunerative employ-         ment.  The  unemployed army is at present in the rest camp ;  soon it will be         on the march.&quot;The Resettlement of Officers. .    The &quot; Times &quot; (5th May) considers that  employers are not quick enough to realise theadvantages of officers&apos; war experience as an excellent training for rapid  mastery of business
requirements, and especially for handling labour.  It may well be that ex-officers havebeen too much discouraged by their first experiences,  and are hampering the Ministryof Labour by &quot; flinging of! in their impatience &quot; and not persevering  in their attempts to find work.  Some of them  are  turning up their noses at the Governments training scheme, though it is framed on efficient and certainly not on niggardly lines.    The  &quot; Morning Post&quot;  (6th May) in a leading article, holds that the scheme for the resettlement of officers  sounds excellent but that in practice it leaves much to be desired.Officials are not accused.   They do their best, and none  know &quot;better the poisonousnature of the system it is their hard lot to try to work.&quot;  The opinion is expressed that further organisation, money, and advertisement are required.                                     PART IV.                                    (I). General. Goal Commission.     The Coal Commission held sittings on the 2nd, 6th and 7th May.  Further evidence has been heard from Economists, including  Sir  L.  Chiozza  Money (one  of  the  Com- missioners)  Mr. A. Greenwood, Mr. G. D. H. Cole, and Mr. L. T. Hobhouse,  and from Mr. J. T. Ryan, Premier of Queensland;  on royalties  from Mr. W. F. Brown (Mineral Adviser to  H.M.  Office  of Woods and Forests), Mr. S. E. Downing (Secretary of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners), Mr. A.  Lawrence (Mining Engineer),  Lord Durham, Lord Dynevor and Lord Dunraven.  Mr. J. T. Forgie, one  of the Owners&apos; Representatives, has been obliged to resign his place on  the Commission owing to ill health.  His place has been taken by Sir Adam Nimmo, K.B.E.  The Miners&apos; Federation  has issued a Report on the Commission, compiled by Mr.  R. Page Arnot.  The Mining Association of Great Britain on the 1st May  passed a resolution acknowledging the services of the members of the Commission representing their interests, but protesting  against the condemnation of the private  ownership of mines contained in Mr. Justice  Sankey&apos;s Interim Report, as  based  on inadequate evidence. The  Miners&apos; Federation held meetings in London on the 1st May with the  representatives of the Government  and the Coal Owners, to consider (a) the miners&apos;  demand that  the pre-war amount of  compensation for insured workmen should be increased by 100 per cent. ;  (6) the legislation necessary to give effect to the Sankey Award;  (c) the request of the Federation that  such legislation should be submitted to it prior to introduction.   Sir Richard Redmayne presided at the Conference, which was attended by  the three Executives  of the  M.F.G.B., the  Mining Association, and the Coal Deputies&apos; Federation. Police.     A demonstration of  the National  Union of Police and Prison Officers was held in Trafalgar Square on the 4th May.  The meeting was addressed by Mr. Pemberton Billing, and  by various members of the Union.  Ostensibly called to demand the reinstatement of ex-Police Constable Spackman, it developed into demands for the removal of Sir Neville Macready and for the full recognition of the Union. Industrial Conference.     On the  1st May the Sub-Committee of the National Industrial  Conference met at Montagu House to hear from Sir Robert Home the decision of the Government in regard.to the policy laid down  in the Sub-Committee&apos;s Report.  A letter  was read from thePrime  Minister indicating  the Governments policy,  and  the  following resolution waspassed unanimously:      &quot;Having heard the  Governments declaration with regard to the proposals of the        National Industrial Conference,  and in view of the necessity for  further joint        consideration  by  the  Employers&apos;  Representatives  and. the Trade  Union        Representatives, the Joint Committee  propose  an adjournment in  order  that        both sides may have an opportunity of considering separately  (and jointly,        if necessary) the Governments reply,  and deciding their attitude thereon; the        Joint Committee to meet again on a date to be decided  by the Chairmen.&quot;
    The representatives of  the trade unions met both before and after the meeting ofthe full Committee-to consider the position.  The programme of the Industrial Conferencefras been  endorsed  by the National Alliance  of Employers&apos; and Employed,  with  the reservation that the questions of the development of industry and the control of production are considered to have had inadequate attention.                                    &apos;&quot;&apos;Bakers.    The Committee on Night-Baking has held meetings on the 1st, 2nd, 5th and 6th may at Montagu  House under the presidency  of Sir William MacKenzie.  Evidence oh  theeffect of night work has been  heard from officials of the various organisations concernedwith the baking industry in England and  Scotland, and also from medical men.Unemployment Donation.    The following is the personnel of the Committee appointed to deal with the abovematter:         Chairman     ......Lord Aberconway.

The Jjat our and Socialist Demonstration in London, organised to celebrate May Day took place without disturbance.  In the greater  part  of Ireland work was practically suspended, and Labour demonstrations were held in the large towns. The Scottish Miners celebrated the day by a general holiday and a large demonstration was held in Glasgow and addressed by Countess Markievicz, M.P.,  anc] Mr. Neil MacClean, M.P. Conscription.     The &quot; Herald &quot; reports day by day resolutions  which it has received  from Trade Union Executives demanding the abolition of  Conscription. Bailwaymen.     Mr. J. H. Thomas has issued a statement on the question of the exclusion of shopmen from the  N.U.R. National Programme.  This is  intended  to mitigate the resentment felt over the matter, and expresses the hope that fresh negotiations will result in a common programme including all railway workers. Vehicle Workers. .    The agreement which has been reached between the London and Provincial Licensed Vehicle Workers&apos; Union (recently amalgamated with the tramway and Vehicle Workers&apos; Union) and the General Omnibus Company, has now been signed by  all but one of the Employers&apos; Unions concerned and  by all of the employees&apos; unions.

The Laundry Workers are dissatisfied with the minimum wage granted under the recent award, and on May 6th a demonstration was organised by the National Federation of Women Workers to support the claim for a  minimum wage of 35s. and a 44-hour week for laundry workers.  Mr. Lansbury presided, and among the speakers were Miss MargaretBondfield, Mrs. Despard, and Miss Godsall.
 Newsagents, Booksellers and Stationers,     The National Joint Board of Retail Newsagents has drawn up a National Programme of 14 points, including better trade terms, the establishment of a Whitley Council for the whole Newspaper Industry, the definite abolition of the halfpenny newspaper,  and the gradual elimination of street trading.  This programme will be discussed at a Conference of the organised trade of Great Britain and Ireland in Leicester, on the 9th July, when the new National Federation of Retail  Newsagents, Booksellers and Stationers  will be in- augurated. Agriculture.     A Conference of the Agricultural Wages Board and the representatives of the District Wages Committee was held at the Central Hall, Westminster, on the 7th May, to discuss the proposed increase of  65. Qd. a week in the wages of agricultural labourers.   Sir Ailwyn Fellowes presided and the speakers included  representatives of employers  and employed from various parts of the country, as well as members of the Wages Board.  A resolution to ask the War Office, in the interests of food production, that as regards soldiers now engaged on tlie land 10  per cent, should be demobilized and the remaining 90 per cent. left where they are, was  passed unanimously without discussion.  Complaints were made from the District Committees that their views were ignored, but no fresh decision was taken in the matter. Co-operative  Union.     A meeting  organised by the Metropolitan District Association of the Co-operative Union was held at the Albert Hall on Saturday.  Mr. Bernard Shaw and Mr. Smillie were among the speakers, and a resolution  was passed pledging  the organisation  of workingulass opinion in favour of multiplying  the membership, capital and branches of the Co- operative Societies, strengthening the Trade Union movement, and making generally for the uplifting of the workers&apos; lives. Training.     A Conference to explain the Governments schemes for the training of unemployed women was held at ,8, Richmond  Terrace, on the 2nd  May.

International Labour.     The Organising  Committee  of the  International Labour Conference set  up by thePeace  Conference has been constituted as follows:          France     ......    ..  Monsieur A. Fontaine (Chairman).                                           Dr. J. T. Shotwell.                                           Sir M. Delevingne, K.C.B.United StatesGreat BritainItaly  ..JapanBelgiumSwitzerland  ,  Mr. H. B                                           Sgr. di Palma Castiglione.                                           Dr. Oka.       .    -                                           Prof. E. Mahaim.                                           Prof. W. E. Rappard.                      Butler, C.B. (Ministry&apos; of Labour), Secretary.    The committee held its first meeting in London on the 6th May.  It is collecting thenecessary information for the consideration of the Washington Conference next October,which will deal with :     (a) Application of the principle of an 8-hour day or 48-hour week.    (6) Questions of preventing or providing against unemployment.

     (e) Extension and application of the International Conventions adopted at Berne in           1906 on the prohibition of the use of white phosphorus in the manufacture of           matches.     The offices of the committee, which will meet usually in London, are at 53, Parliament Street, S.W. 1.   Its duties  will ultimately devolve on the International Labour Office,. when that body is fully constituted. Committee on Industrial Insurance.     The personnel of the committee is as follows :          Chairman    ..     ..  Lord Parmoor, K.C.V.O., K.C.         Members    ..     ..  Mr. W. T. Carr, M.P.                              Mr. N. S. Cautley, M.P.                              Major Evan Hay ward,  M.P.                              Mr. John Hodge, M.P.    ,                              Mr.  N. A. Payne,  C.B.  (Comptroller  of  Companies                                  Department, Board of Trade).                              Mr. G. S. Robertson (Chief Registrar, Friendly Societies)..                              Sir  A.  W.  Watson  (Chief  Actuary,  National Health                                  Insurance Joint Committee).    The committee  is to inquire into the  business carried on by industrial insurance companies and collecting societies (exclusive of the issue of life assurance policies above a certain amount, and of insurance  business under the  National Health Insurance Act),.and to report whether any amendment of the law is desirable.Clothing Trade.    A meeting of men and women employed in the tailoring trade was held on the 6thMay at the Y.M.C.A., Tottenham Court Road.   A resolution was passed authorising theexecutive of the Garment Workers&apos; Union to demand 100 per cent, advance over pre-warrates for men, and  3 a week for skilled tailoresses, for  a 46-hour week, as well as direct employment and  proper workshop accommodation.  Employers in the West End are tobe given until the 19th May to consider these demands.Trade Boards.    Sugar Confectionery and Food Preserving Trade Board (Ireland). The Trade board have varied the general minimum time-rates for female workers of 18 years of age and upwards from 4 flL to 5fci an hour, and for male workers of 22 year of age and upwards,.from 8d. to lOd. per hour, with corresponding increases in the general minimum time-ratesfor female and male workers  under these ages.  The Minister has been asked to make anorder confirming the rates, and to specify the 16th May as the date upon which theyshould come into  operation.    Tobacco Trade Board. At their first meeting,  on the 29th  April, the Tobacco trade board resolved to issue a Notice of Proposal to fix (a) general minimum time-rates ofIs. Ifd. an hour for male workers of 2.1 years of age and upwards, and 8fil an hour forfemale workers of 21 years of age and upwards, and (b)  overtime rates.    New Trade Board. The regulations with respect to the constitution and proceedingsof the Laundry Trade Board were made by the Minister on the 30th April.   The board was established on the 1st May, and the first meeting is to be held on the 29th May.Joint Industrial Councils.    Ministry  of  Munitions. A Conference of official  representatives of the Ministryof Munitions and  the Ministry of Labour was held on the 2nd May to discuss the positionof the technical and supervisory grades in relation&apos; to  the  proposed councils and com-mittees.  There was strong  opposition to the inclusion of the supervisory workers onany other side than the management, either on the Works Committee or on the Depart-mental Joint  Council,  and to the proposal that  the Foremen&apos;s Association should beinvited to the Joint  Conference on the 22nd May.   The question is to be discussed withindividuals of the supervisory grades at Woolwich.     Entertainments. The Joint Committee of the  Actors&apos; Association, the  VarietyArtists&apos; Federation,  the National Association  of Theatrical Employees, and the Amal--gamated Musicians&apos; Union, has approved of  a draft constitution which they intend to put before the Employers&apos; Association  with a view to forming a professional  Council on,Whitley lines.
     Shipping. The Shipping Federation and the Employers&apos; Association of the Port of Liverpool have jointly appointed their representatives on the drafting committee agreed upon by the Joint Conference convened by the Ministry of Reconstruction in November last.     Electricity. The first meeting of the Electricity Supply J.I.C. was held on the 1st May.  Mr. G. J.  Wardle, C.H.,  M.P., presided during the early part of the proceedings. The constitution  was adopted after slight amendment.     Pottery. The  quarterly meeting of the Council was held  on the  1st May.  The questions of the representation of the National Union of  Clerks, the difficulty in obtaining material, and the import of foreign (alleged to be German) china, were discussed.                               (2)  District Reports. London and South-Eastern.     Unemployment. Unemployment in this area is reported to be  &quot; exceptionally serious,&quot; with no prospect of immediate improvement, as semi-skilled and  unskilled factory labour is difficult to place in the London area.  The Brighton area has a special problem in the labour surplus  discharged from Newhaven docks.     General. Negotiations on the 30th April between the London Engineering Employers&apos; Federation and the  men&apos;s union centred round  the problems of diluted  labour and the grading of woodwork on aeroplanes.  These subjects are to be  discussed further  at a future general conference, when it is expected that the further question of &quot; closed shops &quot; will be raised. South Midlands and Eastern.     Unemployment.&apos; Considerable increases in unemployment are reported from Reading, Leicester and Ipswich ;  but no serious rise over the whole area is anticipated. Sovth-Western.     Unemployment. The  main  centres of  unemployment  in  this  area are  Bristol, Cheltenham, Gloucester, Southampton and Swindon.  At Swindon, however, the situation should improve to some extent, as a clothing factory is to re-open on the 5th May and promises permanent employment for 200 women. West  Midlands.     Unemployment. There is very little alteration in  the unemployment position.   In Shrewsbury, where local difficulties are arising from the  discharge of women by the Army Pay Corps, the Sentinel Motor Wagon Co. are carrying out considerable extensions which will allow them  to employ permanently 200 additional workers.     The  shortage  of iron bars is causing  unemployment  among chainmakers.  It is estimated that the chainmaking trade requires at least an extra 500 tons each week.  The reasons given for this shortage are the lack of puddlers,  the lifting of control on iron, the 8-hour shift, and the unwillingness of demobilised men to enter an uncongenial occupation. North-Western.     Unemployment. The  modification of the embargoes is producing  a  beneficial effect on the cotton market,  which may be expected to react on engineering.  An increase of unemployment, however, is  noticeable among  the commercial classes and transport workers.   A certain  amount of unemployment  in the  bottling trades is  caused by the refusal of the Liverpool dockers  to load whisky and other alcoholic beverages.  The bottle trade at St. Helens  is, in addition,  suffering from  inadequate  transport, which affects the supply of coal and sand.  The total unemployment figures for the area have increased by nearly 9,000 for the week ending the 25th April.     A Labour demonstration at Manchester, advertised as an &quot; unemployment meeting,&quot; devoted itself  mainly to a protest against the maintenance  of British forces in Russia, and is described as &quot; not impressive.&quot;  Yorkshire and East Midlands.      Unemployment. There are  no indications pointing to a serious increase in unemploy- ment in any particular area.  Unemployment is evidently past its crisis at Sheffield, and,, in the lace towns, Nottingham reports a decrease of over 2,000 unemployed, mainly owing to a revival of the hosiery trade.  Woollen manufacture is brisker and the cotton mills at Todmorden  are again at work after a fortnights stoppage due to shortage of supplies.
    General. Efforts are being made to induce  the  executives of the 27 trade unionsaffiliated to the Engineering Federation in Sheffield to declare for a 44-hour week movement.The 46l-hour week, with its new rates,  has come into force in the building trades;  inSheffield the  plumbers have agreed to a 44-hour week/and the asbestos workers to a 48-hour week, without reduction of rates.   The textile unions are arranging to collect dataon hours, wages and working conditions.Northern.    Unemployment. Unemployment is reported as increasing slightly in the Hartlepools,Stockton, Gateshead, Newcastle and Durham.   It is decreasing in South Shields, Sunder-land, Darlington, Middlesbrough, Carlisle and Workington, but in the steel and iron centresthis decrease  may be only temporary.   In the Stockton steel and iron works the shortageof coal is said to be a cause of unemployment.  Unemployment at Darlington will be furtherrelieved by the immediate construction of new filter beds.    General. -The refusal to work overtime is  spreading to bricklayers and bricklayers&apos;&apos;labourers employed in the Tyneside steel works.   Another aspect of the  movement forshorter hours is  apparent in the refusal of the coal teamers at the Blyth staithes on theNorth Eastern Railway, to work after noon on Saturday.  These demands naturally involveextensive readjustment of dependent processes and hours.Wales.                                                                        :    Unemployment. No serious increase  is reported.  A strike of general cargo workers,.throwing dock labourers  out of work, has caused an appreciable increase at  Swansea.   InCardiff,  more men are being taken on in the shipbuilding yards.  Unemployment among;women shows a decrease.    . Difficulty is found in resettling disabled men  in South Wales as the staple industriesrequire heavy labour.    General. The outlook in the tinplate industry is described as &quot; ominous.&quot;  difficulties arising from shortage of raw material, lack of coal and transport facilities, increased costs,and American competition in old-established markets,  are aggravated by disturbed labour conditions.   The threatened strike of annealers  would  seriously affect Swansea, Neath,.Port Talbot and Llanelly.  By the 3rd  May, the annealers had  withdrawn their strikenotices, pending decision on the points at issue by the Joint Industrial Council; but itis still uncertain whether the union officials can maintain control.&apos;    A revival of agitation against the maintenance of British forces in Russia, and againstthe Military  Service Act, is reported from South Wales, where John Maclean has been carrying on propaganda work.Scotland.    UnemploymenL-Uhe condition of the Dundee jute trade calls for special notice.  Itemploys 35,000 workers in a city with an estimated population of 184,000.  There are noimportant alternative industries.  Opinion in Dundee  seems to suggest  the  reservation ofthe home market for home producers, and the  manufacture of finer  goods, to escape:competition with Calcutta.  Such smaller jute  and linen towns as Arbroath, Kirkcaldy,.Dunfermline  and Kilmarnock have similar problems.    Motherwell and Falkirk, both iron towns, find it difficult to open out work for unem-ployed women.  The construction of an overhead system of electric tramways should relieve unemployment in Edinburgh.  In Clydesdale,  engineering is  reviving and shipbuildingis active ;  the unemployment figures for  the Glasgow area (roughly 50,000), while serious,.tend to remain stationary.    General.-k meeting held in Glasgow, with Mr. Robert Smillie as president, has pro-tested against delay in housing construction ; 50,000 new houses were needed in Glasgow,but only 700  had been sanctioned, and unemployment  was rife in the building trades.   -                               PART V.-DISPUTES.(a) Involving a stoppage of work.           The strike of the Lancashire milk farmers assumed serious proportions during the week;       the farmers in the Bolton, Accrington and Skelmersdale districts ceased delivering, and there       was also a shortage of milk at Wigan.  The farmers in Lancashire wish to be put on the higher
     scale of prices fixed for the Yorkshire farmers, and contend that milk production does not pay     at a selling price of less than Id. per quart, whereas the new retail price for the Lancashire area     varies from between 5d. to Qd. a quart.  In the Lancaster, Rochdale and  Ormskirk districts,     a strike has been postponed on the offer of the Ministry of  Food to meet a deputation of milk     dealers in London on  Wednesday, the 7th May.   In certain parts of Yorkshire, the farmers     have decided to withhold supplies of milk as a protest against the new prices.  They demand     a rate of  Is. 8d. per gallon for May and June.   It is stated that their action will affect 40 per     cent, of the Leeds milk supply.  The Ministry of Food stated on the 2nd May, that the Lanca-     shire farmers were largely to blame for the prices fixed in their district, since very few of them     troubled to attend the sittings of the  travelling commission which investigated local conditions.     The latest report states that the strike is collapsing in Lancashire owing to divided councils and     suspicion  among the farmers.         The annealers at the Llanelly Tinplate Works struck on the 3rd May.   The men came out     against the advice of their leaders.         Five  thousand miners in the Ebbw Vale colliery struck work on the 5th May.  The dispute     concerns the abolition of allowances  given for working abnormal places.   The firm complains     that the men are not raising as much coal as they ought to, and are not  earning the allow-     ances.  The men reply that a greater output of coal is not possible, because the management     neglect to provide the  proper facilities.  In consequence of  this strike, about 5,000 workers in     the Ebbw Vale Steel Works have been rendered idle.         Between 300 and 400 employees of the Aberdare Council struck on the 5th May to demand     certain wage advances.         It was stated on the 5th May that a strike of fishermen at Milford Haven threatens to lay     the entire fishing fleet idle.         The dispute at the Barrow Shipyard between Messrs. Vickers and their joiners, concerning     the abolition of the premium bonus system, which caused a strike from the 17th to the 23rd     January, has now been settled.  The firm has agreed to withdraw the system from their Barrow     works.         The strike in the Huddersfield clothing trade continues.  At the last meeting of the Hudders-     field  Trades Council it was unanimously  decided to approach the  Co-operative Societies in     Huddersfield with a proposal that they should supply food and other necessaries to the strikers.     It was suggested that the Trades Council and the Unions affiliated should give the Co-operative     Societies guarantees of ultimate payment for the goods supplied.        With reference to  the recent strike at Limerick, it is reported that the proclamation con-     stituting Limerick a special military area has been withdrawn.Not involving a stoppage of work.         There is continued discontent among the engineers in the Mersey district on the question     of the 47-hour week.    They claim that the clause providing that other  working  conditions     shall remain the same has not been adhered to, since the Engineering Employers&apos; Federation     has withdrawn certain concessions with regard to starting time and tea time.  As a protest the     men are refusing to work overtime.        Serious  discontent exists among British seamen owing to the continued employment of     Chinese crews, while thousands of British seamen are out of employment at the ports of London,     Liverpool, Cardiff and Glasgow.        Negotiations on the question of a 44-hour week in the cotton trade continue.. The employers     now offer  a 48 instead  of a 551-hour  week, with an increase of 15 per cent, on standard piece     price rates.  The Textile Workers&apos; Legislative Council have decided  that  they cannot accept &apos;    this offer,  but will place it before a general meeting of the textile workers.                                                                     E.  S.  HORNE.                                                              4                                             I-All enquiries relating to this report should be addressed to :                         INTELLIGENCE  DIVISION,                                 MINISTRY  OF LABOUR,                                              MONTAGU HOUSE,                                                              WHITEHALL,                                                                       LONDON, S.W.1.
