Some weeks ago the Cabinet ; approved the.  organisationof the British repre&amp;eniation on the Supreme .FconomicCouncil *n the following basis *   The representatives were.to be certain Jiinisters of the Crown-with myself.     Since the Linisterg were unable usually  to  attend theWaetin^s of the Council they were to anoint  substituteswho should be empowered to deal with the questions comingbefore the Council.   The exact powers  of these  substituteswere however left in doubt it bein^ understood that  inconsultation with me they were to have  a considerableanount of freedom, of- decision.  . In most cases this  arrange-ment has ror^ed well enough.   The. representatives  of theTreaefcry and the Board of Trade for  instance  have  alwaysfelt themselves able to Give  or -refuse  ministerial  sanction to proposals brought before the&apos; council for Allied decision.But in other departments  it has not been  so.    It is, of.course necessary that important questions  of principle should be reserved for Cabinet  decision.    But if every-point is fco ^o be reserved  the  efficiency of the council as an executive body will necessarily  be  destroyed.  Alliedbodies arc not rcrrrhable in  any  case  for their rabidityof action.   But they become  quite  homeless if every question has to be referred home,    ucocntly for instance a proposed

I aslr therefore for it to &quot;be  laiddorm that the Linisterial representatives on theCouncil may with my concurrence decide all points which they consider can bo properly  so decided  17ithoutreference home.-   In other words I ask that vo  may have discretion in the natter. .  Othcrv.riso the Council will certainly prove unworkable^ and useless.                          (Sd.)  Robert  Cecil.14th ;.nril, 1919.
