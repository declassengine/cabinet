This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majcstv&apos;s Government.] Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1927.CONFIDENTIAL. Copy No.   30CP. 292 (27). [A 6768/133/45]MEMORANDUM RESPECTING THE FUTURE OF ANGLO-american relations.WHILE both His Majesty&apos;s Embassy at Washington and the British Library of Information in New York have furnished very full reports upon the opinions entertained by the United States press and public upon the Geneva Conference and its failure, little material is available showing the views held in the United States upon the future relations between that country and Great Britain. Nevertheless, it is clear that the abortive disarmament conference of last summer is likely to have important repercussions upon American feeling towards this country, if not upon British opinion vis-a-vis the United States. The failure at Geneva has certainly clone nothing to improve Anglo-American relations; on the contrary, it has strengthened enormously those elements in the United States who are unfriendly to Great Britain, and whose object it is to &quot; show the world &quot; conclusively that, while the 19th century may have belonged to Britain, the 20th century undoubtedly belongs to the United Slates&quot;.During the conference an anti-British campaign of considerable violence raged in the.United States press. This was the logical result of some two years of well-organised and persistent big-navy propaganda, reiterating emphatically again and again (1) that the United States Avere tricked into throwing away the naval supremacy within their grasp at the time of the Washington Conference; (2) that scarcely had the Washington treaties been signed than Great Britain set about violating the principle of naval parity by quietly developing an extensive programme of modern cruiser construction; (3) that Britain still clung tenaciously to her sea-power, which only a few years ago had been used to the detriment of American commerce; (4) that British and American interests, political and commercial, clashed in every quarter of the globe. While Mr. Charles E. Hughes was Secretary of State this propaganda made but little headway, for he never hesitated to combat it by public speeches and explanations of the Washington treaties and so on. But the advent of Mr. Kellogg meant a change for the worse; instead of a firm and dominating personality at the head of the State Department, there appeared a weak, irritable and not too friendly politician lacking the courage required in the United States to espouse firmly the cause of Anglo-American friendship. Moreover, the awakening of the United States to their world-wide unpopularity, the attacks of the British press, &amp;c, upon the United States war debt repayment policy, and the growing realisation of the average American that the power and resources of his country are well-nigh incalculable, combined together to create the present aggressive and jingo spirit prevalent in the country, and particularly in Government departments at Washington. The attention of the latter is always concentrated upon this country the leading competitor of the &quot;United States politically and commercially.But what of the future? The shouting of the big-navyites, the rubber controversy, the debt wrangles, and so on, have all left scars upon the feelings of America towards Britain. At the present time, if it is possible to judge from the press, there is scarcely an American who does not believe that the failure at Geneva must be laid at our door. Many who may have entertained doubts on the subject hardened their hearts when Lord Cecil resigned. It is almost certain that a substantial increase in the naval building programme will be sanctioned by Congress during the next session, during which the coming presidential campaign will give an added incentive to the legislators to strike patriotic and anti-British attitudes. But it is doubtful whether all this will have a permanently bad effect upon the American public unless more fuel, in the shape of further naval disagreements, or anti-American outbursts by the British press on the debt question, &amp;c, is heaped 4206   [16847]
upon the fire, now only smouldering. The vast majority of the population are neither militaristic nor imperialistic. They desire firmly to live at peace with the world and to go about their business unhampered by foreign &quot;entanglements &quot; or disputes. But it is easy to play upon their ignorance, their vociferative patriotism and their latent prejudice against this country. Should we at any time find ourselves involved in serious trouble with some other Power, particularly if the circumstances are such as to call for naval activity, a danger point will have been reached. With the increasing importance attached to their export trade, the United States will not readily suffer the interference which we might consider the situation warranted. This question of the rights of neutrals is being increasingly debated in the United States and it is perhaps not without significance that the United States Government are not inclined to attach undue importance to the strength of our imperial structure should this be subjected to the sudden strain of a serious Anglo-American quarrel. This we know from Mr. Hoover&apos;s admission to Sir Esme Howard that in the event of war between the two countries, he confidently anticipated Canada would declare her neutrality.Foreign Office, November 17, 1927.
