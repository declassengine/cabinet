COAL   AND   COKE.LORD GAIrJFORD was able to say that there was already some slight improvement in the demand for blast furnace coke, In spite of the fewer furnaces which had been in blast during the past month.     There was no change In foundry coke, but a better demand for export coke;    and prices in the last two or three weeks had increased for gas coke by at least l/6d per ton. Coking coal and bunker prices had been,on the North-east coast, increased by about 6d. to 9d. per ton, but manufacturing coal and household coal was still, in that district, greater than the demand, and consequently there was considerable depression.SIR ADAM NIMMO observed that the Council had listened with satisfaction to what Lord Gainford had said about betterment in the price of bunker coal and of coke In his district. Taking the country as a whole it would   probably be fair to say that we were just marking time, with a figure cf output of just a little under five million tons a week.     In March 1925, which had been used as a basis month, the average weekly output had been 5,239,000 tons, as compared with 4,943,000 tons for the week ending the 15th October.     The latter figure represented 94t per cent, of the March 1925, weekly average, basis.     The number of persons employed in the industry at the present time v;as 87.4 per cent, calculated on the same basis.     In September the quantity of coal exported from this country was, roughly, 4,242,000 tons as compared with 4,257,000 tons In August, but the value of the September sales had risen by 3d. per ton, so that the tendency in&quot;that direction was all to the good.     Unemployment had been 18.6 per cent, in September,     and this was 1.3 per cent, less than it had been in August, so that there again was a slightly improving tendency.The output abroad that we had to compete with appeared to be very steady.      That in Germany, for example, in August was 12,788,000 tons, as compared with 11,241,000 tons in March 1926, so that their output showed between these two periods a fair expansion.      The output in France had been 4,230,000 tons in August, and 4,400,000 tons during March, 1926.      Tne output that, told specially against us, as had repeatedly been pointed out, was that of Polish Silesia.     There we could see a substantial increase in output from March 1926, which had been 2,259,000 tons, to 3,154,000 tons in August of this year. Then their export of coal had risen from 590,000 tons in March 1926 fo 1,058,000 tons in September 1927.Finally, there appeared to have been an attempt to set up, or a movement towards setting up, a monopoly on this side in connection with the export of British coal to Spain, and a monopoly on the Spanish side to receive that coal and to distribute it in Spain within that monopoly.      The British coal industry was opposed to anything in the nature of a monopoly of this kind.

The British coal industry was opposed to anything In the nature of a monopoly of this kind.
GAS INDUSTRY.MR. C.A. HILL said that various matters were being discussed in the chemical trade in connection with proposals for further legislation on Gas.   These would vitally affect certain sections of the chemical trade, and itvas to be hoped that a satisfactory solution would be arrived at.LORD GAINPORD, referring to tho possible introduction of some gas legislation, said that a rumour of this had reached the coke Oven By-products Association of Great 3ritain, who, however, as an Association, had not been informed at all about it.   They would ask that anything which was being proposed might, at any rate, be submitted to them for consideration, and their views invited before any step was taken; for after all, our big coke oven plants produced gas in enormous quantities, and those plants were attached not only to steel works and to blast furnaces, but also to collieries; and in some cases the gas was sold to municipalities.SIR DAVID KILKE-WATSON said that there had been a suggestion that legislation should be sought for to get rid of some of the difficulties which arose from the statutory restrictions under which the gas industry had to work, and which now appeared to be rather out of date.As to the present position of the industry there was rather a falling off in the consumption of gas at the present moment, but it was probably only temporary.   The price of gas was, generally, coming down, and in many cases it was lower than it had been before the strike.   The price of gas coke was going up.   The export price was tending to rise and the demand from abroad was good.   A new association had recently been formed, called the British Road Tar Association, in which were representatives cf the coke oven interests, the object being to keep British road tar before the authorities whose duty it was to make roads, and especially to look after the rather serious competition which ?ias arising from imported bitumen. The prices of sulphate of ammonia had been falling steadily during the last few years, but it looked as though the bottom had now been reached.    Of com1 se, the lower prices had been to the advantage of the farmer in this country.    It was satisfac-tory to be able to report that China, notwithstanding the disturbances, had taken four times as much sulphate of ammonia this season as she did the last.   It was a very extraordinary and interesting fact.IRON AND STEEL.MR. BOND stated that the latest production figures foriron and steel related to September when pig iron outputamounted to 591,000 tons, as compared -with an output of596,000 tons in August ; but   that   decline   was
IRON AND STEEL (CONTD.).no more than could he accounted far by the shorter month. The number of furnaces in operation bad declined from 165 to 160.   Although there were no signs 01 expansion in pig iron demand (only two furnaces having been b.&apos;.own in), it was hoped that the decline had been stopped at least for a time.   Prices had reached a point, as had been observed at the Council meeting a month ago, where foreign competition in pig iron., except in a few districts, was not serious.    On the; North East Coast prices were firm; while on the North West Coast demand was more than sufficient for the current output, and stocks which had been accumulating were now being &quot;reduced, 20 , 000 tons having been cleared in the last fortnight, leaving 30,000 tons still to be disposed of.     In the Midland districts, which were protected by railway rates from foreign competition, a firmer tone was evident, but in Scotland improvement was not evident and pig iron was reported as going into stock.as regards steel, after three months of continuous decline in production, due partly to holidays, the September output showed an appreciable increase to 777 .000 tons from the output of 643,100 tons in August.    Even thi s output was, however, no more than about 75 per cent of capacity, and this inability to operate more nearly to full capacity was a big factor in the high costs of steel making.    Imports of iron and steel in September had amounted to 312,000 tons, which showed the severity of&apos; foreign competition, in spite of the fact that British iron and steel prices as measured by the Board of Trade were less than sixteen per cent above pre-war.   The position could only be described as patchy.   On the North East Coast there was a somewhat better demand for shipbuilding and constructional steel, but the demand was not sufficient to employ works at anything approaching their full capacity.In South Wales demand was slightly better.   There the steel industry, particularly in the west, was, of course, largely dependent on the sheet and tinplate industry.   The sheet industry had been a ctive for some time, but it had received rather a check and the market was a difficult and an unsatisfactory one,   The difficulties had been increased by financial conditions in India.    In the tinplate trade, which was a large consumer of steel in South Wales, the demand was somewhat better.   Mills in South Wales had been operating about a month ago at only about fifty-five per cent, of capacity; today they were working at seventy per cent, of capacity at least, so there was a distinct improvement in demand, although the price was unsatisfactory.   In the tinplate industry in certain markets, particularly in South America, China, Japan and Singapore, we were feeling American competition rather intensely.   The production of tinplate in the States ran into about two million tons a year.   Their mills were only working to sixty-five per cent of capacity, and they were exporting to some countries at very low prices.   The price of tinplate in the United States for domestic consumption was  4 a ton higher than ours here, but they v/ere selling it under
IRON AND STEEL (CONTD.).our prices in certain markets.   There had certainly been a toning up, so far as the tinplate industry was concerned, in China.   The Shell Transport company were large consumers of tinplate in China.   Shipments had boon stopped for some months and had re-commenced during the last two months; this was going to help the Welsh business a good deal.In oonnection ?/ith the September meeting of the International Steel Kartel, it was significant that the French press had spoken ox&quot; German proposals, made prior to the meeting, that the accumulated funds of the Kartel should be used to attack Great Britain^ home and export markets.   The French press stated that the proposal was not discussed at the meetings of the Kartel, and took the line that such a step was very inadvisable as it would almost inevitably lead to Great Britain adopting protective measures against Continental imports.   The proposal to form selling syndicates in certain steel products had been discussed, but a decision was post-poned to a later meeting which was convened for October 17th, owing to dissatisfaction expressed by Belgium with the quota allotted to her.   It was thought that proposals had been made which would satisfy Belgium, but it appeared that the Belgian delegates were not plenipotentiaries and the proposals did not satisfy the Belgian group.   The meeting convened for October 17th did not, therefore, take place, but it was understood a further meeting was held on October 27th.   No news of this meeting had so far come to hand.   Generally speaking, prices in iron and steel and their products were no better; but, if anything, there was a slight improvement, more activity.LORD GAINFORD agreed that at the beginning of October there had certainly- been an improvement in the steel trade on the North East coast, but that Improvement had not been maintained during the last fortnight.   In certain branches, however, the steel trade was really developing progressively and the firms who produced fabricating and constructional steel were extremely busy at the present time, although many of them were using Continental steel where allowed in their contracts, the price being still about  2 per ton below the price of the British material.In the iron trade there was also some improvement. The prices for Continental iron were very uncertain.   One merchant was prepared to sell at 59/- per ton; another would not take even 63/-.   That was an indication of lack of stability.   One rather interesting feature in connection with the iron trade was that, whilst for the nine months ending September the quantity of foundry, forge and basic imported was 479,000 tons as against 2 32,000 a year ago, in the month of September the position was exactly the reverse; 61,000 tons wore imported in September 1926, but only 32,000 tons in September this year.   That was, no doubt, a satisfae tory feature.
HiSTEEL.SIR ARTHUR BALFOUR was able to make a better report this month; there had been a deoided improvement in the last four or five weeks.   Whilst there did not appear to have been much absorption of the unemployed in the Sheffield district, there was no doubt that those people who were employed were v/orking much nearer full time, and it was also quite certain that they were making much larger earnings all round, and were much happier in consequence.   Probably the orders already received, and those which were coming in now, would pretty well ensure the trade running out to the end of the year with fairly high exports.Sir Arthur had been taking out some figures of volume as between 1916 and this year, and had found that the volume which was being produced in Sheffield of speoial steele and engineers&apos; tools, files and so on, was greater in 1927 than in 1916.   The volume did not look very much with their enlarged piano, but actually it was greater than they produced in 1916 which was a war year and when the war demand really   commenced.Another very Important feature in Sheffield was that the spirit of labour to produce was very much improved; in fact it was better today than it had been for years.    The men were really helping production, and that had very great possibilities.Sir Arthur agreed entirely with Sir Philip Nash (see section on Electrical Industries) that the one &quot;fly in the ointment&quot; was the American situation.   He did not think it was so serious this year, but next year, if it still remained, it ?/ould be a difficult thing to overcome.    They were finding in Canada pressure from the American steel tube manufacturers such as had not been felt before, and they might be coming along and attacking our foreign markets, probably at a time when we were improving; and they did not oare what they promised or at what price they sold.    They generally discredited themselves in the long run, but it vTould mean difficulties for us to face.One of the disturbing things about the American situation was that the fall in consumption would upset the market. Things began to droop all round because consumption in the United States was lessening, and this frightened buyers from going ahead here.    In the Australian and New Zealand markets there was nothing to complain about;.in South America conditions were favourable;   In Japan they were bad, that market was reoovering but slowly.   The Chinese trade still went on it spite of adverse circumstances.MR. VYLE asked how far tho United States could get rid of their surplus production by export unless they were prepared to leave the money in payment outside Amerioa indefinitely.   They offered no means whatever of getting that money into Amerioa.
STEEL (CONTD.)SIR ARTHUR balfour aaid that in the United States they were very casual on that subject at the present time.   If they mentioned it they would say, Hwe do not care whether our money comes back or not&quot;.   That might not be true, but at the moment tho.t was how they were treating it.NON-FERROUS METALS.SIR CECIL BUDD observed that Sir Philip Nash had Mentioned the oable trade as being good (see section on electrical Industries).   That was about the only branch of the metal industries which was in a satisfactory condition. There was a certain amount of work going on, of course, in the home trade, but the export markets were very bad indeed, and we suffered very aoutely from Continental, particularly German, competition at the present time.   The Germans were making a dead set at the Indian and South African markets, and were quoting prices which had no relation whatever to costs.   Probably that was due to the fact that their own mills wanted work.    Generally speaking, the metal trades were not well employed and a great deal of their business was being done on very unsatisfactory terms.ELECTRICAL INDUSTRIES.SIR PHILIP NASH stated that in the home market there was probably less demand for central station plant, that is the heavy plant, than there had been a year ago.    That must be due to the holding up of schemes under the Central Electricity Board, and this was giving some anxiety.   Orders placed now would be under production and possibly under delivery by this time next year, but there seemed to be little prospect of work for this heavy plant business being required in this country during the next twelve months.   The Scottish scheme had now been approved, but it would be some time before the undertakings themselves could decide what was the best thing for each to do.    They had to negotiate with the Central Electricity Board as to new plant and so forth.   The London scheme had been published, but there would be some opposition to that, and this would not be settled for some time.    The Electricity Board, where they saw there would be a shortage of power in 1928 or 1929, were making arrangements as far as possible;    but orders for heavy plant were inevitably being held up, and the trade felt that it would be this time next year when they would really feel a shortage of work.

ELECTRICAL INDUSTRIES (OONTD).On the other hand, the small plant, that Is to Bay-consumers 1 orders, were showing signs of distinct improvement, and it seemed to he a rising demand, showing that industry generally was placing orders for renewals and additional plant as it had not been doing for some considerable time.On the export side, demand was quite normal and the British industry was maintaining its high position; but there were signs of much Increased competition from Amerioa.   The big plant makers there were finding that their own home market was falling off.   Plant makers in Amerioa could usually depend on about 93$ of their capacity being occupied by the home market.   But this year that figure would show, up to date, some 10% or 12$ decrease, whioh was considerable in the oase of big plant.   That would make them very active to obtain export work, - particularly in the South American market where we felt their competition most, and in the British Dominions.   They attacked in two ways, in price and by very easy terms of payment.   We saw that developing no?/, in both big and small plant.On the cables side of the industry, prospects appeared to be fairly good.    In mains cables every maker was reporting busy shops.   There was also plenty of work on the rubber covered cables.ENGINEERING.iiR. RICHIdOND wrote&quot;The current conditions in the engineering industry, unlike coal, steel and several other industries where the product is capable of reduction to a unit standard, do not permit of very definite comparisons.   The picture of the industry can therefore best be made up on a geographical basis, or by certain major divisions of product.   Under either of these aspects, the general trend today is towards a gratifying improvement.    On the Clyde, the new shipbuilding oontracts placed in October have exceeded those in any previous month of this year, and this will have Its refleotion in the engine shops during 1938, and the fears of a falling off In employment in the first months of next year are consequently removed.    In the East of Scotland, however, there has not been the same access of new work, and the position is barely being maintained.   On the North East Coast the outlook is distinctly brighter, and though prices remain lev, a satisfactory share of the work available is reaching the shops In the district.&quot;In the Midlands, rolling stock establishments are moderately full with work, both on home and foreign aocount. Birmingham, Coventry and Wolverhampton are all well satisfied with the outlook for next year, and the unemployment figures in these districts are declining.    The heavier tradeB of South Scoffordshire have not yet, however, participated in
CONFIDENTIAL. ENGINEERING (CONTD).the improvement to any extent.   From London and the South there are satisfactory report, and a better feeling as to next year&apos;s prospects, with the unemployment rate in these districts ouch below the average of the country.&quot;With regard to foreign trade returns, the tonnage of machinery exported in September amounted to 45,826 tons, an increase from the average level obtaining in the previous months of this year.    The September return brings the total exports for the completed nine months to 365,000 tons, which represents 71 per cent of the 1013 rate, and is just in excess of the corresponding amount for last year.   Machinery imports increased from 8,000 tons in August to 9,300 tons in September&quot;.UR. BR077NLIE stated that, from the point of view of the work-people, trade was, in many districts, still in much the same condition as it had been for some time past.    In the Marine Engineering industry people were fully employed, and that applied to the Electrical industries, as would have been gathered from the observations of Sir Philip Nash (see section on Electrical Industries), and it applied also to the motor industry.   There was some apprehension, however, as to the Immediate future.COTTON.SIR WILLIAM CLARE LEES thought that, in general, no change had taken place during the last month in Manchester. There had been no really big buying.    The amount of goods that came forward for finishing was rather surprising, but the order books were distinctly light.As regards China, it was stated that there was some clearanoe of goods going on up the Yang-tse, and that these clearances were distinotly in excess of what was going into the sea-ports of the oountry.   The figures which Sir William would hand in (see Table II at the end of this section) would show you that the shrinkage of imports of cotton goods into China had gone almost to nothing.In Italy the position, so far as Manchester was conoerned, was distinctly easier.    The competition from a oost point of view was not now so severe, but a very striking example had been met with of a difference in dealing with industry from a Government point of view.   It appeared that in Italy there was a tax comparable to the Exoess Profits Duty, but that it was optional on the part of the firms either to spend the money on reconstruction
CONFIDENTIAL.COTTON (CONTD).of their businesses, or to hand it to the Government.    It was of course very largely spent on re-vitalioing their industries in one way or another, and in one or two places instances were found where fims had adopted water power. It had been stated definitely that water power in the full sense, that is without using ooal at all, could not be adopted on an economic basis.    It had been done, however, because the money spent on it would have been spent in the form of taxation if it could not have been used for that alternative purpose.   That had put them in a very strong position; they had thio wonderful organisation of boilers which were not in a central unit but spread over the works, steam being generated by electrical elements inside the water itself.   They were not very happy at present, however, and were -working short time.   They had, in many cases, bought their cotton far ahead, but still their supplies would come to an end, and on the whole they did not appear to be better off then we were at the present time.Sir 1. Clare Lees had been making a study of the way in whloh tariffs in a few selected European countries affected cotton piece goods and would hand in a statement (Tables IV    and   V below) which summarised the matter in a few figures, from which he   would quote one or twoa   He had taken one or two specifif classes, one of what might be called &quot;ordinary Oldham counts&quot; and one of the finer &quot;Bolton counts&quot;, one a poplin cloth, and the other plain woven cloth.    On grey goods going into Prance the duty would amount on the common cloth to 36.7 per cent.    On the total weight of the goods when dyed it would be still 36 per cent., but the incidence on the dyeing only was 158 per cent., so that in France imported grey goods were taxed 36 per cent, but the dyeing on the same goods was taxed 158 per cent.    In Italy, the sane cloth would be taxed 17.0 per cent, for the grey and 91 per cent, for the dyeing, taking the dyeing as a single unit.    In Germany it would be 13 per cent, on the grey, but when applied to the dyed goods, the import duty was 103 per cent, on the dyeing only, while for Spain, which of course was almost mad in these matters, it was 116 per cent, on the grey and 395 per cent, on the dyeing only.With regard to the other statements which he would hand in the position still remained that having regard to the 15 per cent, reduction in hours since 1913, the first nine months, January to September, showed 71.5 per cent, of the 1913 level in employment, and that in itself varied from 63 per cent,    in the grey to nearly 85 per cent, in the dyed goods.   The other statement with regard to countries whence our cotton goods were consigned, remained very much where it was before; there had been no marked change&apos;during the last month.    Shipments to India had been beginning to fall off a little, but there were signs that she would begin to buy again shortly.
CONFIDENTIAL.COTTON (CONTD.).Sir William also handed in a statement on our yarn exports.    It was the most encouraging picture of the Lancashire trade.   Taking the first nine months of the year January to September, and comparing them with the same period in 1913, the exports were about the same in actual weight; but, bringing the reduction in hours into consideration, the employment of labour for the actual export of yarn wa3 114.4 per cent.; and again, if it was borne in nind that there had been a very considerable shift over to finer counts, the^volume of employment found by the export of yarn, qua yarn, was decidedly better than it had been in 1913.   There had been a pronounced growth in some markets;    in South America a yery large growth;    in Australia and Canada a considerable one;    and in Europe also, a growth amounting to 143 per cent.   A good deal of this was Egyptian yarn.   About 12 per cent, to 15 per cent, of our production of yarn was for export; so that these favourable figures related to a small section of the trade.The Tables handed in by Sir W. Clare Lees were as follows:-

COTTON (CONTD).COLONEL SEDDON BROWN observed that In the Egyptian spinning section, the mills still continued to run full time, although there was some small falling off in the amount of orders being booked.   In the weaving section, probably about 25% of the looms of Lancashire were idle.In the coarse spinning section, whichvas of course the big Oldham trade, conditions were terrible.   Mills were in difficulty all over the county indeed, In this particular trade.   The latest figures referred to. the week before last, and in the coarse industry they only sold in that week 44&apos;$ of the normal output of the mills.     A great many mills were going bankrupt, and others were making various schemes of arrangement with their creditors, but - it was to be feared -were only putting off the evil day.In the cotton trade it was usual to carry large stocks in foreign countries, consignment stocks in various parts of the world;   but the Germans were attacking those British traders who carried stocks in Germany, in an endeavour to make them pay turnover tax.   The case was being heard now in the German Courts, and of course it would create a great difficulty If a turnover tax had to be paid on consignment stocks, which were really stocks belonging to the British trader.A Liaison Committee was trying to bring together the Yarn Association and the Spinners&apos; Federation,   The Yarn Association, as was well known, fixed prices and determined the amount of short time that its members should work. Unfortunately, members had not been able to remain loyal to this Association, nor to control prices as firmly as they thought they could.   Further than that, they had&apos;to meet the competition of those members of the Federation who were not members of the Yarn Association, and who v/ere able to quote such prices as they wanted.   Thus, the whole price scheme became chaotic.     This joint Committee from the two bodies was now meeting to see if anything could be done again to fix pr-ices and regulate short time.   Perhaps they had a bigger task than they would ever be able to master, but some good was coming out of it, because the Committee at the present moment was busily engaged on Investigating costs of production and seeing if it could issue any report which would be helpful to the trade in that direction.1*0CL.THE PRESIDENT observed that Mr. Aykroyd and Mr. Arthur Shaw had esch sent him observations in writing on the position of the Woollen Industry. (Copies of these communications are appended).      It appeared that Mr. Aykroyd was dealing with a period up to the end of August, whereas Mr. Shaw was referring
WOOL (CONTD).to the period of September and October.     This would account for a certain inconsistency between the two reports, and Mr. Shaw^ would appear to be more up-to-date as an indication of the present position.MR. SHAW wrote:-&quot;I note from the minutes of October 5th that Col. Willey referred to the General Wage Agreement in the Wool Textile Trade, which expires at the end of November.     I am sure you will appreciate that no observations from the writer should be made, which might Intensify the problem.       I am happy to state, however, that the atmosphere is very good between the two sides, and no stone will be left unturned to try and arrive at a satisfactory settlement of our difficulty.&quot;Having regard to the changed circumstances, It is very difficult to estimate the general effect on the trade, but It is a remarkable fact that so far as the Bradford trade is concerned there has been a general feeling of optimism during the past two months.     Trade is certainly improving, and It has been shown In a remarkable manner by our Unemployment returns.   During the first week in September, for the Bradford District, we had 10.28$ of our membership signing the Register. There has been a decrease each week, and our final figures show that 5.84;* were signing on October 26th.    It is possible, of course, that anticipation of a cessation of work may have caused some employers to go on full time.&quot;Another remarkable feature is the large number of firms who have made application to the Industrial Council for per-mlssion to work protected persons overtime for six hours per week.    In the Bradford and Huddersfleld districts there are more persons working overtime today than in any other period since the 48 hours   was established.   The Huddersfield Trade has steadily improved since the first week in July, and the average unemployment for this district is below 9%,   On the other hand, the Heavy Woollen Trade has not maintained the improvement which was shown from June to August.   This also applies to the Yeadon District, where the percentage of un-employed has steadily risen from about 2% during the whole of... May and June, to Ibp during the current month.&quot;I might add that the Trade Unions have decided to make a special investigation into the working conditions in Germany, and a delegation, which includes the writer, will leave this country on Saturday (tomorrow).       We expect to be able to complete our inquiries in about ten days&apos; time, &quot;MR, AYKROYD wrote&quot;Mr $haw&apos;s figures regarding the decrease in unemployment I quite agree with, but I am viewing the whole from a rather different standpoint.   I do feel that the anticipation of a cessation of work has had something to do with the increase In employment, though not wholly,,
7/0PL (CONTD).&quot;I attach a Memorandum on the position of the Wool Textile Industry togethsr with some Board of Trade figures showing exactly how we stood at the end of August regarding the imports and exports of raw wool.   You will observe that in 1927 (January to August) wo have 311,283 lbs (In centals) less wool left for home consumption compared with the same period In 1926.   If we look into the figures for the same period 1925-26, the result is shown that in 1926 we had left 829,079 lbs (in centals) weight of wool over 1925 for home consumption, which shows we are now in a very much weaker position for clothing our machines than we were twelve months ago.&quot;The short supply of wool Is causing a rise In value and in addition it may be the reason for firms buying goods in anticipation of a further rise and to protect themselves.   This does not necessarily mean a lasting improvement in trade;   that will only be shown later,&quot;Mr. Shaw rightly approaches the position In this country from the standpoint of labour.   I am approaching it from the standpoint of raw wool to run our machines, and naturally the employment of labour will follow.   If our supply is much less In one year than another labour must necessarily suffer.&quot;At the present moment Russia and Japan are buying heavily in the markets abroad, creating a difficult position for us who are requiring raw material, and I must say that I am firmly of the opinion that the increase in employment Is only temporary and that the outlook Is not reassuring.   The problem we have before us is, how to get ourselves into a position to be able to compete with foreign countries in buying raw material.&quot;With regard to the figures of 194 firms that have gone out of existence since the 1920 crisis, these figures are based on the actual number of firms known and who were members of the Woollen &amp; Worsted Trade Federation, and the details as to the number of spindles and looms are taken from their own returns to that Body&quot;^RAW     WOOL.

WOOL (OONTD *).Mr. Aykroycfa Memorandum on the Position of Trade Inthe Textile Industry in the West Riding of Yorkshire.Slnoe the Advisory Counoil Meeting on the 5th Ootober the position of the Textile Trade in the West Riding has not varied muoh, but there are several factors which really are necessary to bring to the attention of the President.1. That our export trade is diminishing.2, That Continental competitors are rapidly overhauling us in the Foreign markets and under-selling us in the Home market.3. That the success of Continental competitors is to a considerable extent ascribable to the lower wages paid by them, and consequently to their lower wages costs as examplified in the fact that French wages rates were approximately 53% and German wages rates approximately 45$ of our ownj that in addition to the lower rates of wages there were grounds for believing that the 48 hours&apos; week was not adhered to by our Continental competitors and in support of the an Agreement was quoted., under which German workpeople oould be called upon to work 54 hours per week without the payment of overtime rates.It is difficult to make exact comparisons of the condition of the industry at different dates,but all the evidenoe tends to prove that the Industry is to-day in a state of depression almost equal to that of the early months of 1925, 1925 being the year of crisis in the Textile Trade.The Woollen Section for instance has not increased the numbers employed, and since January of 1925 has only increased the total wages paid by 7.4$, which indicates that a number of workpeople have been fortunate enough to go on full time or to work less short time than formerly.    Even this bit of oomfort is&quot;found to be transitory.   The Improvement which took plaoe during the four months ending July 1927 was confined to two Districts in the Riding, namely, the Heavy Woollen District and the Leeds District (as defined by the Ministry of Labour Gazette) and a re-action has now set in.   The depression In the Huddersfield District and the Halifax and Oalder Vale District oontinued with little abatement.Respite the recent extension of the export of Tops and of Worsted Sarns to Germany, the number of operatives employed in the Sorting and Combing Sections of the Industry in August 1927 is 12$ less than in January 1925 and the wages paid are 13$ leas, while in the Worsted Spinning Seotion the number employed is 2.5$ less and the wages paid 10.5$ less than in January 1925.In addition to the idle machinery due to short-time working it is necessary to take Into acoount the amount of machinery definitely standing, and it is a matter of oommon knowledge that this is considerable in all Sections of the Industry.
Mr. Aykroyd&apos;s Memorandum (Oontd.).To this short time working and Idle machinery must be added the loss of employment due to machinery being broken up and Firms going out of existenoe,    A complete account is impossible but records in the Employers1 possession show that sinoe 1920 it is definitely known that 194 Firms have gone out of existence and there is good reason to believe that the list is being continually added to.    It has not been possible to ascertain the total amount of machinery owned by these Firms but where records are available relating to 129 out of the 194 Firms it is found that in the case of 31 Firms owning Worsted Spinning plants there were 166,900 spindlesj in the case of   39 Firms owning Worsted Manufacturing plants there were 6,555 looms; and in the case of 59 Firms owning Woollen Manufacturing plants there were 2,041 Iooibb with corresponding quantities of Carding, Spinning and Finishing machinery necessary to a complete plant.   The figures cited above are in themselves striking evidence of the continuance of the Trade depression.Additional evidence is to be found in the records of the Export trade.     The following table shows the exports of the main articles of V/ool Textile products for the average of the pre-war year 1909/13 and the years 1924/5 and 6, together with the first eight months of 1926 and the corresponding eight months of the year 1927.-Exports of British Producgvdescription	Average	1924.	1925.	1926.

WOOL (OONTD.). far. Aykroyd^ Llemorandum (Contd.)whioh 8 months of 1927 will also bear to the total exports of 1927, (or in other words, assuming that any proportionate increase or decrease in 1927 over 1926 will also apply to the whole of the years exporting) we find that the export of Tops is about equal to the average of the 5 pre-war years; that the total export   of yarns is decreased by over 16$; that the export of woollen tissues is decreased by lC-i$j that the export of worsted tissues is decreased by 62^; that the export of flannels is decreased by 30%%i while the export of blankets is inoreasod by 15$.Even since 1924 we find that the export of Tops will, on the same basis, have increased by 6/J and of yarns by 10$ whilst the export of woollen tissues will have fallen by 25$; of worsted tissues by 32$; of flannels and delaines by 38g$ and of blankets by 48$.This lndioates the alarming proportion of our pre-war export trade which has been lost and is continuing to be lost in commodities employing any appreciable quantity of labour.It. is no oomfort to those engaged in spinning and manufacturing that wool should be brought into this Country, sorted, oombed and re-exported in combed condition (having employed relatively little labour) whilst spindles and looms become Increasingly idle here.The export of tops, yarns and tissues is only one portion of the work of the wool Textile Industry and It may be argued that the depression in these sections exaggerates the depression in the industry as a whole; that any diminution of the exports of these products has been compensated for by an inorease in exported olothing and hosiery.   An examination of the evidence shows that this is not the case.An appreciable part of the products of the Industry is exported in the form of apparel and this out-let for our products has diminished almost equally with the export of tissues.i iExportB of Apparel for 8 months in the years named. 		1924.	1925.	1926.	1927.Uuter Garments					Overcoats,					.

WOOL (OONTD.) . Mr. Aykroyd&apos;s Memorandum (Contd.)As the fall in the prioe of the articles of which we have record of quantity and value is only 4$, the deoline in the total value of the ,carments exported is indicative of a praotioally corresponding deoline In the quantity.    The table above shows that there has been a continuous reduction year by year amounting in the aggregate to over one-third of the total exports in 1924.   The depression has not therefore been alleviated but has been aggravated.Woollen and worsted Yarns are also used in the Hosiery exports and as these show no appreciable change during the last four years It Is dear, that there has been no alleviation from that source.The other great Market for our products   is that of the Home Trade.That the Home Market for wool Textiles le depressed eoaroely needs demonstration.Our Continental Competitors, with their wages costs now averaging little more than one-half of those of this oountry are rapidly and surely displacing us In the markets of the World.    (It may incidentally be remarked here that the 194 Firms previously referred to, who were formerly running machinery in one or other section of the industry - nany of them with complete self-contained plants - who have gone into liquidation or have otherwise been compelled to give up business, would not have taken that course if there had been any expansion of the Home Market to make up for their loss of the export trado.)A further indication of tho depression in this Industry is furnished by the reduced proportion of wool retained for use in this oountry.   The Memorandum on Production and Trade prepared by the League of Nations for the International Economio Conference gives the following Indices of the World&apos;s production of Wool:-1913 .......... 1001923........... 841924........... 871925........... 93and at page 27 it says that the contraction recorded in the above figures is mainly due to diminution of the Russian Clip.   Russia is now a large importer.The following Table sets out the percentages of wool retained in this oountry in the years 1923/7 compared with the year 1913:-Total Wool, Skin Wool and Pulled Wool retained In Great ^britain.World&apos;s Wool Produotion.Total Wool retained inGt.Britain.T 100 56.3 66.2 62.71913. . 1923.. 1924.. 1925.. 1926.. 1927..100 84 87 93100 63.3 76.1 73.957.67 Abased on 8 mos.) 51.58       n       w      &quot;
WOOL (CONTD.) .Mr . Aykroyd&apos;s frieirorandum (contd.) .From this the broad fact emerges that at least 93$ of the pre-war wool supply is available to-day but the Wool textile Industry of this Country is using muoh less than its pre-war proportion.    If it had maintained its pre-war proportion it should in 1925 have retained for home consumption 93$ of the quantity it retained in 1913 whereas in fact it only retained in 1925 73.9$.   The deduction is obvious.   The raw material is available but othor countries are using It.In addition it should be noted that this available quantity, does not clothe as many machines as 1913 as the counts spun are thicker owing to high cost of produotion.ARTIFICIAL SILK.MR. ADuXSON wrote:-&quot;The Artificial Silk trade continues busy in every direction&quot;.OEM .T.CA1S .MR. C,A. HILL reported that the chemical trade, both home and foreign, had shown Bteady progress during the last two months, and this had been fairly ovonly distributed amongst the various sections.   Exports during September had been  400,000 in excess of September 1926, and  230,000 in excess of September 1925.   That followed on similar improvement in August.A scheme had been set on foot with respect to the list of chemicals which had boon exempted from Safeguarding duties.    It was expeoted that the action of tho Board of Trade, in granting only temporary exemptions would be fully justified.POTTERY.MR. HOLLINS reported that the branches connected with sanitary ware were still on short time. It was not clear why this part of the trade had fallen off; it might be due to there being a glut on the market or because buyers were holding off for a fall In prices, - very likely tho latter. It had been
POTTERY    (CONTD).said that with the reduction of the building subsidy prices ought to fall.     In North Staffordshire there had been a reduction of 5/- per thousand in the case of building bricks, and it might be that buyers v/ere waiting for a similar reduction In sanitary bricks.The unemployment figures v/ere very much the same as in September.   The famous Wedgwood Works had now installed the very latest electric kiln firing; it was producing v/onderful results and for high class goods it was the finest thing that had been placed in the market.     The Corporation of Stcfce-on-Trent had assisted them in the preliminary stages by altiost giving electricity free for a time, and they were urging all factory owners to put in similar, plant, and were willing to make good terms with them, the charge being something like a farthing a unit.     The saving in cost over coal firing was very considerable, and the colours produced were more brilliant. They could only, however, get about 750 or 800 degrees temperature, so they confined it practically to the decorative goods that did not need a higher temperature.   Biscuit and glost ware needed a temperature of about 1,200 degrees.   It was a matter of interest that the conservative pottery trade was open to entertain the latest inventions.RUBBER.MR. JOHNSTON stated that the situation of the rubber manu-facturing trade was still comparatively satisfactory.   Despite very keen foreign competition, which meant that production figures in some sections were more satisfactory than profits, there was no doubt that the British trade was holding Its own, and, in fact, gradually improving its position.     The tyre section was active, although prices were keen.     So far, little benefit had been felt from the inclusion of tyres in the McEenna duties, owing to the enormous stocks accumulated prior to the imposition of the duty, but there was no doubt that within the next few months a beneficial effect would be felt.     It was interesting to note that up to the present there had been no advance   in   price   to   the   consumer, notwithstanding the serious effect on cost caused by the rise in cotton.     It was expected that within the next six months two large factories installed by foreign manufacturers, largely due to the duty, would be in operation.In the rubber footwear section, business had been very satisfactory and ths co-operative advertising propaganda scheme had increased the demand for this type of footwear. Foreign imports were considerable, but the British factories were so far able to compete without loss, and v/ere fully employed.     In general rubber goods, with the exception of a few special lines, business was up to the average and the demand for general engineering rubber goods certainly seemed to suggest a general improvement in the general Industries
RUBBER    (OONTD).of the country.     Employment in the trade generally was improving gradually, overtime being worked In certain sections, The export trade, especially to the Dominions was satisfactory. The Continental markets, however, were becoming increasingly difficult owing to the steady development of national industries combined with a tendency to increase in the tariffs.   Generally speaking, as one with an organisation in nearly every Continental country, Kr. Johnston could say that the net result of our efforts in the Continental markets was practically always a serious loss, so that it was doubtful whether that section of the export trade was of any net value to the manu-facturers, other than from the point of view of employment.FOOD INDUSTRIES.SIR STANLEY liaCHIN wrote :-&quot;This is the period of the year when traders expect to be busy, but from reports I have received from manufacturers and merchants, it appears that trade in this branch of commerce has not yet reached normal conditions for the time of year. V/hile orders are plentiful, buyers are exercising cautious action and hesitate to lay in their usual stocks.   It Is pleasant to record that exporta are fairly  well sustained except on the Continent, where business in many important markets has almost ceased to exist&quot;.GENERAL TRADE.LORD GAINFORD observed that the recent depression in trade was attributable, according to the views of the Federation of British Industries, to the fact that it was necessary for us in this country to adjust our internal price level to the world gold price, as measured by the level of prices in America, the only important country on the gold standard, and consequently that time was required to secure a sufficient inflow of gold from outside into the reserves of the Bank of England so that the industries and trade of this country could be provided with the bank credit necessary to enable them to resume expansion on pre-war lines.    In their forecast for the coming year the Federation said:-&quot;the outlook for next year, so far as British trade at any rate is concerned, Is brighter than it has been at almost any period since the conclusion of the war.&quot;x x x
GENERAL TRADE.  (CONTD).&quot;The unexpected reduction of the U.S. re-discount rate by the Federal ?.e3erve Board in August, with the openly avowed object of relieving the monetary stringency in this country, has transformed the whole outlook. Looking to the future it is now possible not only to anticipate a cessation of the fall in the international price level which has been in progress almost without interruption for over two years, but, what is of even greater moment, a progressive weakening of the forces which have been militating against the expansion of the export side of our trade since the war, so leading to a restoration in the balance between home and foreign trade more nearly approaching what it was in pre-war days.&quot;That was a very satisfactory forecast given by such an organisation as the Federation of British Industries.Most of their reports Indicated signs of Improvement in most branches of industry.   In connection v/ith coal, con-ditions in the South Wales area did not seem to improve to any appreciable extent;   the tone in the Durham and Northumberland area seemed to be a little better.   In iron and steel the market had improved to some extent during October.     The pig-iron section remained the most hopeful and steady.   In the hematite branches the position was better than it had been for some time past,   October had witnessed an upward movement in the price of copper.     The spelter market had become rather weaker owing to the fact that the galvanizing industry did not show any improvement. The position of the shipbuilding industry appeared to be satisfactory   as        the result of the placing of further small orders.   Machine tool makers were rather better employed, whilst constructional engineers appeared to be well placed for the next few weeks.   Motor car manufacture had been stimulated as the result of the motor Show.   The outstanding feature of the raw wool market continued to be a scarcity of wool and tops for prompt delivery.     An encouraging feature of the yarn trade was the renewed activity in mohair.   Demand for overseas shows some expansion though the  price factor was still having an adverse effect. As to cotton, the account was very depressing.   Business in hardware in the Sheffield area had been fairly well maintained. The Birmingham metal trade had been busy, and there had been a steady improvement in the pottery industry.     In boots and shoes business was continuing to expand substantially.MR VYLE said that under the head of General Trade there was nothing much to report, except that the month of October had been better than the previous month;   but that ought to be expected, because many seasonal changes had occurred by this time which tended to improvement.   On comparing last
GENERAL TRADE.  (CONTD).month with the October of a normal year, it would leave much to be desired before we could say that we were really back on a good sound flowing basis.     Certain details, however, showed up a good deal better than in 1925.     The timber trade still made a good report.     The fruit trade at Hull reported very good sales.     On the other hand, the prices of fish landings at that port were, in 1926, at an average of 2.15d per lb., whilst in 1927 the average was l,84d per lb.In the Leicester district, the Hosiery industry was experiencing an increased demand in the foreign trade: home trade orders were small but frequent, and often stipulated for very quick delivery, which was sometimes difficult to give,      Nottingham&apos;s report was much the same; but their lace trade was far from satisfactory, the disappointing feature being the shipping trade.   They still renewed their complaints that the Lancashire and Yorkshire manufacturers would not supply yarns and materials in reasonable time to enable them to do this small trade.     Orders were, in consequence, sometimos cancelled and business was lost.In the south of Scotland It was stated that trade was good all round, and firms were booked ahead for some months to come.COLONEL SEDDON BROWN thought there v/as an explanation as to Leicester not being able to get the supply of yarns required.     Leicester, Nottingham, Hinckley and other places had turned on to more of a luxury trade, and were demanding from Lancashire and Yorkshire an enormous amount of fancy yam doubled with art silk and worsted, and fancy things. In the old days, when they were busy manufacturing ordinary cotton hosiery for abroad, they took ordinary standard cotton things, and if only they would tak6 them again that would help materially.TEE PRESIDENT pointed out that Lancashire - and this applied to some extent to the 7/est Riding of Yorkshire too -had got to recognise that the world would only take about 75$ of the old commodities which it used to take, and that was the reason for the development of these fancy lines.COLONEL SEDDON BROWN agreed.     Lancashire was anxious to develop, and was developing very fast, but he did not think that in this particular instance it v/as Lancashire&apos;s fault. More art silk was wanted for doubling and mixing with these yarns.     It was a new industry which would have to grow, but Lancashire was showing great energy in getting forward with this business.     Another difficulty was that Lancashire would have to develop, both In spinning and in weaving, on to the finer end of the trade, which undoubtedly was keeping fairly steady: but the coarse mills had plodded along for such a length of time, in the hope of some revival coming, that it was to be feared they were now in a position of not having the capital to turn on to anything else, and they would simply have to go to the wall.
GENERAL    TRADE  (CONTD.) .SIR STANLEY MAC KIN wrote :-&quot; I regret I am unable to report signs of any great corrmerclal improvement.     ivhile things are undoubtedly rather better, and the future is regarded more hopefully, it Is difficult to see from where any substantial and lasting improvement is to come.     I have just returned from a visit to Paris.     As you are doubtless aware,  at the International Chamber of Commerce the question of trade barriers is considered one of great.importance, but speaking as an individual, it seems to me that what foreign countries support in principle, they absolutely deny in practice, and I am concerned as to how long we, in this country, shall be content to stand by and see prohibition and increased tariffs against u3, by those who declare their desire to make inter-national commerce more easy.     During the last twelve months, it appears to me that British Commercial opinion has undergone a very great change in this respect.     Many who were advanced free traders now agree that things cannot be allowed to continue as they are.1&apos;&quot;Retail and Distributing Trades.MR. DEBENHAM reported that retail trade remained normal, perhaps had got rather better, and there were signs of improvement in the connected wholesale trades.     The cost of materials was going up, and that was likely to increase the cost of production.Co-operative Wholesale Society.MR. HaYHURST said that sales in every section of grocery and provisions were very satisfactory, the latter part of October showing very substantial increases,     But it was to be regretted that we had to buy so much from Denmark; we would rather buy it at home instead of sending three or four million pounds out of the country.As to sugar, the expected reduction in British Refined took place last week-end, foreign going down very soon afterwards. Subsidised home-grown beet was on the market, with supplies Increasing from now onwards, - it was not known whether it would prove good value or not.     During the past week the market in corn had been quiet.     Liverpool stocks showed an increase on the previous week, owing to fresh supplies.     As to wheat, during the past week the market eased a little, with some
GENERAL TRADE.   (C017TP.) .Co-operative Wholesale Society (Contd.).pressure to sell new crop, United States of America supplies being marketed more rapidly than the trade would absorb at recent prices.     It had been stated that the Argentine had an increase in sowing of a million acres;    and, should this crop go through without serious damage, we might reach a point of overproduction with a probable decline in price.The production of foodstuffs had been satisfactory, and there was a satisfactory report in regard to furnishing and boots and shoes.5he tea market had been steady for all descriptions excepting that the commonest tea had been   showing a hardening tendencyc      The quality of tea coming forward was now of a lever kind, the finest new season s teas having already been for sale.and having passed the hammer during the last few weeks.     Most sellers have had to advance their prices a month ago to the retailer, and others had advanced them just this week because, taking the last five months, the average market prices were up 5d. a lb.      This increase in market cost had been brought about through, shortage or expected shortage of    tea from North India, where half the supplies of the world were grown.   Notwithstanding the high prices the home consumption of tea continued to increase.As to cocoa,   It was very apparent that there was a big attempt by group speculators to control both supplies and prices, and it was stated that the farmers in West Africa were being offered rebates for quantities in order that the group might obtain control of the raw cocoa.   An American Syndicate was buying up all the cocoa they could, for the purpose of putting up the price.   What v.ould happen was difficult to predict, but America was again tempting for big supplies, and it was stated to be in evidence that Bahla in South America was the counter of the higher figures in West Africa.GENERAL TRADE AND BANKING.MR. CURRIE observed that money had been in good demand during October and the Bill Rate well maintained.     Very considerable stringency had been experienced during the first two days of the current week, and the market had had to have recourse to the Eank of England.     The other deposits of the Bank of England disclosed in last week&apos;s
GENERAL TRADE AND BANKING (CONTD.).Return were the lowest since September 1919.   This indicated that the Bankers&apos; balances at the Central Institution were at an unusually low level.   The return of the Clearing Banks for the month of September showed that the peroentage of loans to deposits continued to be high - over 54$-.MR. BRAND wrote:-&quot;There Is little change, since the last Council meeting, in the outlook for money rates.   The German and Dutch Bank rates have been raised 1$ each, as it was then thought probable would be necessary, and the future outlook is again for higher rather than lower rates.&quot;in London the level of &quot;Other Deposits&quot; in the Bank Return Is the lowest since September 1919.   As there are no Treasury Bill maturities in the first part of the present week, and end of the month requirements promise to be on a substantial scale, stringency is likely in the near future. Neither does the more distant outlook promise easier rates. Continental bank rates are on the up grade, and payments for Imports form America will have to be made soon.   These two factors will probably offset any ease which might have been given to the market here from cheap money conditions in New York, and the lowering by the Reichsbank of its gold buying price to discourage the import of geld into Germany.&quot;In New York the Federal Reserve system is expanding credit to meet the seasonal demand and this, combined with the lower level of industrial activity, the probability that the peak of new issues is past, and the smallness of the Government&apos;s needs for new money in connection with the coming redemption of Liberty Bonds, indicates a continuation of cheap money conditions.-   On the Continent, rates have been somewhat higher.   In Berlin there is a temporary ease In Call Money due to funds deposited in preparation for the end of the month settlement being utilized on the market.   This condition is purely temporary, however, and is in sharp contrast with the stringency in other parts of the market. The recent rise in the Bank Rate has not materially increased the foreign exchange holding of the Reichsbank, and bills are now being offered for discount to finance trade requirements at 773-7!% without finding buyers.   The Reichsbank, in consequence, has had to disc cunt the bills with a resultant large increase in its portfolio.   It is probably only the desire not to increase further the depression on the Boerse that prevents another rise in Bank Rate.&quot;Withdrawals of franc balances have increased rates in Paris slightly and the Banque de France has been obliged to sell sterling to maintain the exchange.   Large means are still at the disposal of the market, however, and there is no reason to anticipate any further rise in rates.   In Amsterdam call
GENERAL TRADE AND BANKING (COiSTD. ).money rates have been eased by the purchases of sterling and dollars of the Netherlands Bank- and by the withdrawal, for end of the month purposes,  of short term money placed in Germany. This again is purely temporary easo, however, and has not affected the discount market where rates equal to the Bank Rate are quoted.&quot;Finally, easy conditions for short torm money continue in Switzerland, though the recent slump on the German Boerse caused some selling of stocks at low prices.&quot;SHIPPING.MR. ALEXANDER SHAW thought that tho -shipping industry was perhaps a little brighter.    The figure of shipping freights for September,, taking 1920 as a hundred per cent, was 26.9 -not much more than twenty five per cent of the 1920 figure, but a slight improvement on the month of August, although as compared with a year ago it v-as down by about five points. Then in regard to laid up tonnage, the figure on l3t October this year was 272,000 tons net.   That showed a considerable improvement on the figure for 1st July this year, which was 420,164 tons net, and on the figure for a year ago, 1st October, 1926, which was 371,000 tons.With regard to what Mr. Sanderson had said (see section on Australian Trade) in regard to Australian products at the Dairy Show, not only was Australia entitled to take great credit for the excellence of her products, but a good deal of the credit must also fall to the shipping industry which had brought those products so many thousands of miles under extraordinarily difficult conditions through the tropics. It pointed to a great improvement in the refrigeration on the newest steamers, and that process was going on constantly.Then in regard to tonnage under construction.   On 30th September there was a total in the world under construc-tion of just over three million tons; tonnage of 1,536,416 tons gross was under construction in the United Kingdom, as against 1,537,641 tons gross under construction abroad.   In other words, Great Britain was constructing half of the total world tonnage.   That was an immense improvement on the posi-tion a year ago when the total construction going on in the world had been 1,850,000 tons, the foreign construction being over a million tons and British construction being not much more than three quarters of a million,.   Then in regard to tonnage commenced, in the quarter ended September 30th, the last quarter, there was commenced in Great Britain and Ireland tonnage amounting to 370;,000 gross tons.   That was, of course, a very great improvement on the preceding year when
SHIPPING (CONTD.).the tonnage commenced in that quarter reaohed only 68,000 tons. The coal dispute no doubt had had a great bearing on that. The figure for the September quarter was not quite so good as the preceding quarter&apos;s figure, to the 30th June this year, when there was commenced a total of 437,000 tons.The Statistician of the chamber of Shipping called attention to an interesting fact in regard to bunker coal. The prioe of South Durham bunkers f.o.b. Newcastle at 15/3d a ton in September was low, seeing that the average for 1913 was 14/-; nevertheless the total quantity shipped as bunkers in September, i.e., 1,530,000 tons, was substantially less than the 1913 average monthly figure of 1,750,000.RAILWAY TRAFFIC.SIR HERBERT WALKER wrote:-&quot;From a review of tho traffic carried by the railways it would appear that there are distinct signs, although very gradual^ cf an improvement in trade.   During the last eight weeks the revenue of the four groups from freight train traffic shows an increase, as compared with the corresponding weeks in 1925, of 9$, part of which, of course, is attributable to the increase in goods rates, which took place as from the 1st January last.!&apos;0n the passenger side the figures are bad, and there has been a large fa J ling off in the number of passengers carried, due principally to three causes: -1.   The contraction of the spending power of the public due to the coal strike last year.2.   Road competition both by public and private motor cars.3.   The bad weather which was general throughout the summer months.&quot;MR.R.H.HILL said that passenger receipts had continued to deoline, and the August figures were bad.With regard to freight rates, the figures for August were rather more cheerful.   There was an increase in the tonnage over that of August., 1925, of nearly 2oj2, or 4,370,000 tons, of which coal accounted for 3,353,000 tons.
C 0 Mi? IDENTIAL . 4 r, .nx o  RAILWAY TRAFFIC  (CONTD).&quot; This -large- increase In the tonnage of coal, amounting to 27$ compared with 1925, was to some extent discounted by the fact that tonnages In August 1925 had been low owing to the heavy purchases in July in anticipation of a strike.   For the eight months up to the end of August the tonnage of all traffics had increased over 1925 by 3.7$.With regard to special traffics, there were notable increases, in August last as compared with August 1925, in iron and steel, amounting to 21.5$; iron-stone and iron ore, 45$ - (but there had been a very small tonnage In August 1925); pig Iron, 19^$; timber, 10$^; and oils - largely petrol - 27.8$.EMPLOYMENT .MR. PHILLIPS said that the unemployment figure remained fairly constant.   One noticeable feature about it was the rather curious rise of 25,000 at the beginning of October.     The Ministry of labour had no precise details of that figure, but in all probability the rise was due to the considerable number of discharges in the building trades, following the reduction of the subsidy at the end of the month.   The only other point of interest was that whereas there had been a net increase of 24,000 all over the country during the month, there was a net reduction of 12,000 In the Midlands and the North East of the country, an increase of 16,000 in London and the South of England, and an increase of 20,000 in Wales and Lancashire.THE PRESIDENT raised the question of the best estimate that might be obtainable of the net increased number of people going into employment year by year.   There were one or two considera-tions affecting it, viz., that the health of the people was much better and that emigration was much less.SIR ARTHUR BALFOUR thought that the figure would be something near 500,000.liR. PHILLIPS observed estimates of that kind had been made from time to time, and he would have the available figures got out in time for the next meeting.AUSTRALIAN TRADE.IMR. SANDERSON pointed out that at last month1 s meeting of the Council he had rather a gloomy aocount to give about the absence of rain in Australia;   but during October rains had fallen, mainly in the dairying districts on the Eastern coast, and to a less extent in the agricultural areas.     The pastoral areas, however, except portions of Queensland and New South Wal.es, were still suffering, in some districts severely, from drought.   There had been heavy losses of stock and that condition of things was still continuing.   The wool sales were progressing at satisfactory prices, but it was reported that the proportion of the clip coming to Bradford was rather less than usual.   That, of course, might always adjust Itself later In the season. &quot;&quot;One Item of Interest was that at the recent Dairy Show at Islington, Australia took the first, second and third prizes,-gold, silver and bronze medals. - in the unsalted Colonial butter class, and first and third in the salted.   She also took first prize In the imported erg class, and at the Imperial Fruit-:jc-

The last crop was the biggest that they had ever had, and the prospects of the present crop, - although it was a little early to speak definitely yot,     v/ere quite as good;    in fact the shipping season for cereals was likely to overlap, sc that there would be no dead season at all.   Another feature which was helping the Argentine was that the Caja de Conversion, which had established a gold currency, was now successfully open, and there was not the slightest fear of it breaking down, as they had a gold reserve of rather over 80$.   Further,    the Meat *-Var was finishing.As regards American competition out there, the Americana were popular neither v/ith the Argentine Government, nor with the people, and If our traders could supply the machinery and other goods that were needed at equal prices or even a trifle more, they would get the orders every time.   The Argentine was likely to be ordering very largely;   this was a natural consequence of good crops and other fori^s of prosperity;   but in the Argentine, as elsewhere, there was an increasing tendency for them to establish factories themselves.   The output of their local factories v/as replacing the supply of foreign goods to the Argentine.The same remark applied to Chile, Brazil and Peru.     Our traders would be asked to supply the machinery for making the goods, and therefore the tendency for those who supplied machinery from here should, no doubt, be to devote their special attention to those markets now,   There was always, of course, the desire of purchasers to aim at buying machinery which was not too costly.   Sometimes it would seem from the reports from South America that British machinery was so superb that they really could not afford it.In Chile, the position of the nitrate trade was oertainly somewhat better than it had been a few months ago.   The sales of nitrate that they had contracted for amounted to about 2^ million tons for the year ending next June.In Brazil the market was very good.   They were practically stabilised in their currency now.   Mr. Hose^s remarks as regards orders for machinery applied very particularly to Brazil, where there was a very big demand, for machinery for all classes cf work like textiles and electrical work.   In Brazil they might perhaps not pay cash, but the people who wanted to buy the goods on credit were in many cases&apos; &amp;mply good as security for the money. Some very big contracts v/ere going out there just now.
