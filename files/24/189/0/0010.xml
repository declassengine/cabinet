[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1927.CONFIDENTIAL.CP. 260 (27).I ASKED Sir R. Lindsay, who has had many years&apos; experience of Egyptian affairs six as Under-Secretary of Finance in Egypt, and four in the Foreign Office and is now His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Berlin, to give me his views on Sarwat Pasha&apos;s proposals. I think that the Cabinet will be interested to see his memorandum.A. COctober 29, 1927.Memorandum on the Draft Treaty with Egypt, by Sir Ronald Lindsay, G.C.M.G.FOR more than forty years Egypt has, de facto but not de jure, been a part of the British Imperial system, but Egypt herself has never explicitly recognised the fact. Till 1914 she hugged herself in the shadow of Turkish suzerainty; during the storms of the war she cowered under a British Protectorate; which she violently repudiated the moment war was over. The irregularity or extra-legality of the British position has always been a source of embarrassment to His Majesty&apos;s Government in the past and almost certainly will be so again in the future. The great virtue of a treaty even of a treaty as drafted by Sarwat is that it gives Great Britain a legal title for what she holds. It would be worth the while of His Majesty&apos;s Government to pay a heavy price and to overlook many defects in the treaty itself ff, in a negotiated document. Egypt would consent to enter into the orbit of the Empire.2. Not that any Egyptian would ever admit aloud a dependence on Great Britain, or that any responsible Englishman should ever advertise its existence! For no nation is more vain, more charmed by mere words and phrases, or more easily satisfied by the shadow while conceding the substance, than the Egyptian. Take Sarwafs own memorandum on the British counter-draft its general sense from beginning to end is : &quot; Why embarrass me by claiming in so rnany words things which you already have or which can be conceded implicitly? &quot; Take again the arrangement of 1922. By it His Maiesty&apos;s Government conceded the word independence and kept everything else which they must keep; yet it brought Egypt from the verge of rebellion to a state of comparative quiet, which has lasted for five years; it has enabled the relations between the two countries to withstand one terrific strain; and it seems to have brought about such a state of mind in Egypt that her Prime Minister can seriously put forward this astounding draft. Instances could be multiplied. To concede the shadow in exchange for the substance was the current coin of every British official in Egypt, even under the Kitchener regime.3. Egypt then is and has been, in fact but not in word, a Dominion, with rather more self-government than India, and with a good deal less than the territories colonised by English stock. It is noticeable that since the war all the Dominions have somewhat drawn away from the centre of Empire. I am not sufficiently acquainted with them to know how far the parallel with Egypt can be carried, but I think that with Egypt too it would be wise policy to loosen the painter somewhat. It has always been a great convenience to His Majesty&apos;s Government to be able to answer criticisms by saying that in such and such a matter they do not care to interfere with the discretion of the Egyptian Government.4. The position of British officials in Egypt will always vary somewhat with the political feeling of the moment, but in the long run it will inevitably depend on the stronger character of the European. At the beginning of 1919 at a meeting of Nationalist leaders, one of them (I think Loutfi Said) said, not jokingly but in all seriousness : &quot; We must get rid of all Englishmen and not one can remain, for if a single one is left, every Egyptian who is in a difficulty will run to him and ask4176   [16746]
him what to do.&quot; To define a British official&apos;s powers is mere shadow and dangerous shadow at that; for definition may connote limitation. What is important is a marked check on the recruitment of non-British Europeans. Englishmen were not withdrawn from Egypt in order that other Europeans should replace them. Those other Europeans must realise in the future, as they did in the past, that their advancement depends on their ability to work in, not only with Egyptians, but also with their British colleagues.5. Strategically Egypt is an island, with a line of access through the Isthmus of Suez and another through the Sudan. Command the sea, hold the Isthmus and the Sudan and you have Egypt in the hollow of your hand. Incidentally also you secure Imperial communications through the canal. For strictly Imperial purposes in normal times, and granting that in abnormal times further measures can be taken, the Isthmus jmd the Sudan is the substance which Great Britain must have and the rest is well, if not the shadow, yet very nearly that; and certainly, therefore, that which Egypt will find it most hard to concede. There are indeed considerations which will make it difficult to forgo garrisons in Cairo and Alexandria; but we cannot legislate for every possible contingency; and considering the mobility of modern troops, is more wanted than force enough to deal with a riot in its earliest stages ?6. If the question of the Sudan can be left out of the treaty altogether it would certainly be the easiest and probably also the wisest course, for we have there already all we want and Egypt has only the shadow of the double flag and the word con-dominion. I should&apos; surmise that Egypt may hesitate a good deal before she stops her subsidy to the Sudan, for if she acts so, a shadowy condominion will become more shadow)7 still.7. One point more. I think it fortunate for His Majesty*s Government that at this supremely important moment in Anglo-Egyptian relations, they should have Sarwat to treat with. I know him well, having had a good deal to do with him, and I think him the most intelligent Egyptian I know. Mere intelligence is common out there, but he, during the war, fame under a certain British influence from which he has acquired a sanity and breadth of view very rare in the East. For an Oriental he is courageous and reliable more so than many Europeans we have to deal with every day. In a preceding paragraph I have called his draft treaty an astounding document; but far more astounding is the fact that he has taken the initiative of drafting and putting it forward. This is an almost inexplicable reversal of all ordinary Eastern form. I can hardly believe that he will be able to put his treaty through in Egypt, and I hope His Majesty&apos;s Government will not break a willing-horsed back by overloading it.   They will never get a better one.
