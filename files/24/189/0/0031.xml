Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1927.CONFIDENTIAL. Copy No,     30CP. 281 (27). [A 6671/435/6]BRAZIL&apos;S ATTITUDE TO THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS.I HAVE received the following account of Brazil&apos;s attitude to the League of Nations from a good source.   I believe that it sums up the position pretty accurately.A CNovember 10, 1927.THE enthusiastic support accorded by Brazil to the League of Nations from the outset was due to the certitude that the United States would also be found at Geneva. The rejection by the Washington Senate of the Treaty of Versailles, and of the solemn pact which forms the preamble, appeared to the Brazilian Government an &quot; interruption,&quot; the consequences of which would be nullified by the future. That opinion was shared in 1919 by the whole of Latin America. The League formed at Geneva appealed to the latter by reason of the spirit of equality expected to prevail there, and of the opportunity apparently offered of escaping from the hegemony of North America. The latter has since given repeated proofs of the indifference with which she regards the League and of her determination to keep away from it, with the result that the first impulse has given place to an attitude of reserve, which in its turn, thanks to the meetings at Geneva, has been transformed into a sense of discouragement.Geneva with Washington, presented considerable advantages; without her, only danger, the nature of which was brought out clearty by the adoption of the 1924 Protocol. As a matter of fact, the United States would never have agreed that the Republics of Latin America should intervene in quarrels other than those arising in their own Continent. They (the republics) would have hurled themselves in vain against the determination of the United States to preserve inviolable the Monroe Doctrine. Besides, the traditions of Brazilian history, as well as Brazilian interests, dictate an American policy for this country.. The &quot;Latin nations of the New World&quot; is only an empty phrase. The rivalries which divide these nations may be less acute than those which trouble the Old World, but they are not less real, and in their midst lies Brazil isolated for she is not of Iberian origin. And were she. from motives of sentiment or sympathy, to allow herself to pursue a &quot; European &quot; policy, would not the neighbouring countries, inspired by memories of the past, revive those old covetous ambitions, threatening signs of which were manifested in the past by the Vice-Royalty of the Plata ? Thus Brazil, not being of Spanish origin, would find herself isolated. On the other hand, the United States cannot afford to disregard Brazil, which has rendered considerable services to them in the past.Those who are in favour of the League, and who would ensure the continuance of Brazil in that body, are under no delusions as to the difficulty of their task. For it was easy enough to&quot; adhere to the League in 1919 at a moment when it was possible to count on the presence of the United States at Geneva; but to return there with the certitude of finding the United States permanently absent, is a more delicate matter.4199   [16825]
