ANGLO-EGYPTIAN THBATY.Memorandum by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff onthe draft Treaty submitted to the Egyptian Agreement Committee I of the Cabinet on 7th November, 1927.. Staff were in agreement.     The draft Treaty of November(CP. 267 (27) ) reproduces these military clauses rearranged and, in some cases, reworded, and at the seme time introduces certain important modifications which have a direct bearing on the future of our military position in Egypt.      The points for consideration appear both among the Articles of the Treaty and in the Annex thereto. 2. Articles of the Treaty.Article VI replaces Article IV in the July draft, with the exception that the words &quot;which one ally may properly afford another during a war in which both are engaged&quot; are omitted.      I am cf opinion that, in order to safeguard our position in the event of war in which this country may be engaged, these words should be reinserted in the Nov3mber draft so as to emphasise the impossibility of Egypt considering herself neutral in such circumstances.Prom the military point of view, however, the most importaxit alteration in the &quot;Articles&quot; of the Treaty is tho introduction of a new clause towards the end of Article VII. This stipulates that if, after a period of ten years, on a reconsideration of the localities now occupied by the British garrison, we should fail to come to an agreement with the Egyptian Government, the question cay be submitted to the league of Nations, whose decision Is liable to a further reinvestigation after another period of five year3 in certain explained circumstances. .    a  .1.The draft Treaty of July, 1927, contained certain military clauses and stipulations with which the General- 1 -
he Alines. 148Further important alterations are introduced into the Annex appended to the Treaty;    briefly summarised these alterations are:-(a) 0?he July draft limited the strength of theEgyptian Army, during the next ten years, to 12,250men serving with the Colours.     The new draft imposesno such limitation,fb) The new draft introduces a fresh clause which ensures that, in default of previous agreement to the contrary, tho scale of British officers now attached to the Egyptian Army will he retained under csisting conditions for ten yeers*fc) Tho July draft pz-omised that Great Britain would furnish the Egyptian Government at cost price with the requisite armament, munitions end supplies not produced in Egypt, and that the Egyptian Government would agree to obtain these from no other sources.      The now draft is worded so as to admit of considerably wider interpretation and is to the effect that the armament employed &quot;by the Egyptian Army &quot;shall not differ in type from that of the British Army&quot; and that His Majesty&apos;s Govex-nmcnt will use their good offices, when so desired by tho Egyptian Government, to facilitate its supply from Greet Britain.Before considering the effect of the above proposed alterations to what wgg cgreed to in July this year, I wish to make it quite clear thnt the role of the British garrison in Egypt is to enstrre the protection of the Sue a Canal which is tho vital link in. cur chain of Empire ooaimunicationa with the East.     The garrison is calculated, in regard to its strength, composition and location, as representing the minimum required for this
purpose.     Any modifications, therefore, which would lead to a weakening of the power of the garrison to carry cut this role should not, in my opinion, he mads without the gravest consideration of their future effect.     I will therefore deal with each point in turn and analyse the effect of its acceptance hy tis on the main problem defined above.Tho modification introduced in Article VII pieces in the hands of an authority, not under tho control of His ISajesty^s Government, the ultimate decision (after 10 years) of how our forces in Egypt shall be located.      In rogard to this, the General Staff have always hold the opinion that, for the defence of tho Suez Canal, it is essential to maintain a military hold on Cairo as well as to control the freshwater canal.      In order to have control of the freshwater canal, on which the water supply of the canal zone depends, the military occupation of Abbassia, close to Cairo, is also essential. She military reasons for these views may be summarised as follews(a) Internal trouble In Egypt means danger to our communications through the Csnal.      Cairo is the breeding ground of any trouble that i3 likely to be hatched and its military control is therefore the surest safeguard against trouble breaking out.(b) There is an Egyptien garrison of between 4,000 and 5,COO men in Cairo, who might in certain conditions.join the forces of disorder,(&apos;c) If, for the defence of the Canal, we limit our-selves to the occupation of the zone bordering its banks, we should be placing our troops in the unenviable position of depending for their water supply on a source whose control was entirely in Egyptian bauds.     Moreover, they would have in their rear a potential?^&apos; hostile Egyptian Army whose numbers, under the present proposals, are liable to an undefined increase.
In this connection it is to be recalled that Lord Allenby, at a meeting of a Sub-Committee of the Cabinet in 1921, expressed the opinion that it was essential that troops should be kept in Cairo and Alexandria,.but that, if the country remained tranquil we might withdraw to Abbassia and jnustapha which are suburbs respectively of Cairo and Alexandria. (CP.- 89/23).General Raking, and the late General Congreve, who have both recently commanded the troops in Egypt, have definitely agreed that the only.way to protect the Suez Canal from outside aggression or from a hostile Egypt was to. maintain control over Cairo. There, is., therefore ore,.. a strong consensus, of high military opinion, in favour of the. continued occupation of Cairo as being essential to the defence of the Canal,  and I consider that any concession which may lead to our being forced to evacuate Cairo involves a .danger which to should not be justified in accepting. I cannot, therefore, advise the acceptance of a clause In the Treaty which places a decision on this point in the hands of an authority over whom re have no control.Incidentally I observe that, under the terms of the I^ovember draft, the right of a second appeal to the League.of.Nations (after 15 years) is reserved for the Egyptian Government.     I should have thought that such a right might, .in all fairness, be extended to both High Contracting Parties.6.     In regard to the point raised in paragraph 3(a),  (strength of the Egyptian Army) as financial limitations may in practice prohibit a marked Increase
in the strength of the Egyptian Army., a concession of the right to make this increase mav, possibly, not be of vital military Importance..     It is to be remembered, however, that the danger to be feared from the Egyptian army is not based so much on its potentialities as an organised military force, as on the risks cf its degenerating into an 3rmed mob, which would join in with rioters.     Any material accession of strength will, therefore,  increase the potential danger of popular uprisings or disorders which might excite active sympathy in the Army. Further, if the increase assumed really large proportions, we shall be compelled to counter the enhanced menace by maintaining stronger forces in the Mediterranean and in Egypt than -.ve have at present, with a consequential increase to our military estimates.      In short,  vfclle an increased Egyptian Army would,  from our point of view, have distinct disadvantages, they do not appear to ikes to be so grave that we should not be prepared to meet the Egyptian Government on this point..In this connexion and in view of the discussions on disarmament which are at present taking place at Geneva,  a possible basis for compromise mij.ht be found in an agreement for a mutual limitation of strength;   but I consider that adequate provision, would in this case, be necessary to enable &quot;as to increase our own force a as required in an emergency.
7.      Passing over the point raiaed in paragraph 3(b), 152 I come to the control v;e should exercise over Egyptian armament and munitions;    this is possibly the point of most immediate importance.-     The exact interpretation of the expression &quot;shall not differ in t^pe from that of the British Army&quot; is uncertain and appears to concede the point that these arms need not necessarily be of British origin,     There is, moreover,, nothing i:; the remainder of the clause to prevent the Egyptian Government from purchasing their armament,  in whatever quantities they choose, elsewhere than in England, Although the danger to us of an increase in actual numerical strength of the Egyptian army may not be very great, the eouipmsnt of that army,  even at Its present strength, with large numbers of machine guns, artillery and other modern appliances,  increases Its efficiency and therefore its po^er for harm,  in the event of its turning against us,      If we continue to control the supply of their armament and monitions we retain in our own hands the power to limit or cut off the supply,  should such action prove necessary and expedientMoreover,  from the point of view of a friendly army, if the co-operation between the British and Egyptian forces which is legislated for in Articles III, V, and VI is to have effective military value..,  it is essential that the armament and munitions of the Egyptian Army should be of a pattern which can be maintained from British sources *In view of the above considerations I am strongly of opinion that control of the supply of Egyptianarmament and munitions should be retained by us, andI urge that the -!.&apos;ordinj; oE&apos; clause 3 of the Annex in the july draft should, be adhered to, as it is both fair toale vthe Egyptians on the grounds of co-operation and/gives us adequate security/ - --
This clause reads:-nEis 3ritarmic Majesty^ Government will furnish, the Egyptian Government at cost   price   with the requisite armament and supplies not produced in Egypt, and the Egyptian Government agree to obtain these from no other source5&apos;oI again reiterate the importance of making no concession of this point.So     Finally I refer to para. 2(b) which deals with the retention of British officers on the Egyptian Army Sotab-lioheent for 10 years.    These officers undoubtedly exercise a certain degres of control and influence in the Egyptian Army, and I consider that the stahi-ii;-. ion of their position for 10 years will be advantageous from the military point of view and should be suppcx^ted,A point which requires further elucidation is whether the wording of Annex I (a) admits cf an increase being made to the British personnel corresponding to any future increase that may take place in the Bgyp+irn Army.OOITGLTJSIOjff.       9c     I summarise my recommendations as follows:-(i) Article YI.    The wording of Article IY of the July draft is preferable.(ii) Article YIIIn view of the paramount importance of ensnring the integrity of tho Saoz Canal we must not allow to pass cut of our control tho decision cf how the British Army in Egypt should be distribxxted,( iii)   Not included in November draft.An increase to the present strength of the Egyptian Army, whilst undesirable, is not necessarily a vital factor in our main
.problem, provided the British officers are increased in proportion.(Iv)       Annex I ( c ),     We must ensure thecontinuance of our existing system of controlling the supply of armaments and munitions to the Egyptian Anny.(T)        Annex I (a).       The retention of British personnel in the Egyptian Army on the existing scale as agreed to in the November draft is concurred in.(Signed) G(. Pc MILNE,    General, Chief of the Imperial General staff.:War Office.November 10th, 1927.
