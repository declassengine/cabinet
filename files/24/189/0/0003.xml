DOCUMENT IS THB PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT) . CRET. COPY NO.osr   (or/)CABINET. THB CROWN PROCEEDINGS REPORT COMMITTEE, RE P OH T.1.     At, their Meeting on 6th April, 1927 (Cabinet 24(27) Conclusion 5)  the Cabinet had before them a Memorandum (C.P.116(27)) by the Lord Chancellor covering the Report of the Crown Proceedings Committee and agreed (a) that the Report of the Crown Proceedings Committee should be published)    (b) that before its publication the Lord Chancellor should arrange to ansv7er a Question in the House of Lords to the effect that the Government held themsel-w. j perfectly free in regard to the Report, and (c) that in due course the Prime Minister should appoint a Cabinet Committee to consider the Report.2.      On the 7th April,  1927, in reply to a Question by Lord Novar, the Lord Chancellor, after a brief reference to the circumstances in which the Report had been prepared, stated that it would be for the Government to consider whether and how far the changes proposed are desirable and are feasible,  and that they must reserve full freedom eithe to adopt or not to adopt any of the proposals contained in the draft Bill prepared by the Committee *    (Hansard (Lords) Vol 66,  ColSo 913 and 914).5.      The Cabinet Committee was subsequently constituted as follows
The Lord Chancellor (Chairman). The Secretary of State for Indiao The Secretary of State for &quot;ar, The First Lord of the Admiralty. The At torney-General. The Solicitor-General,,The Financial Secretary to the Treasury* Lord Birkenhead and the Secretary of State for War have not been able to attend the Committee&apos;s Meetings04,      In addition to the Report of Lord Hewart1 s Crown Proceedings Committee and the draft Crown Proceedings Bill appended to that Report,  we have had before us a Memorandum and Notes on the Bill prepared by Parliamentary Counsel, a Note on the Bill prepared by the Lord Chancellor^ Department, and Memoranda circulated by the First Lord of the Admiralty and the Financial Secretary to the Treasury giving the views of the Admiralty,  the Treasury and the Boards of Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise on the proposals *      Y.&quot;e have also been supplied with a Note of the conclusions reached at an informal meeting of Departmental representatives held at the Treasury In July 1927*5.     The Cx&apos;o?7n Proceedings Committee f?ere appointed in 1921 by Lord Birksnhead to consider the position of the Crown as litigant and to propose such amendments of the law as the Committee might consider advisable and feasible having due regard t6 the excoptional position of the Crown, and to prepare a Bill embodying and giving effect to such changes as they might feel themselves in a position to recommendc      In 1924, however,  the Committee&apos;s terms of reference were modified by Lord Haldane, who requested them to prepare a Bill on the assumption that certain alterations in the lav were both desirable and feasible.     Lord Hewart&apos;s Committee were thus relioved of the duty of making recommendations as to the desirability or feasibility of the
of the proposals,  and confined themselves to preparing a draft Bill which would give effect to the alterations desired by Lord Ealaane-6.     The draft Crown Proceedings Bill is in three Parts - Part I assimilates the procedure in those cases in which the crowdy;n is concerned as litigant, whether as plaintiff or defendant, to that which prevails in actions between subjects, and effects a further assimilation by giving to County Courts jurisdiction In Crown cases * Part II assimilates the position of the Crown to that of the subject in certain points of substantive law.  viz. liability to be sued in tort,  limitation of liability in the  case of Crown ships and salvage claims by or against the Crcwiio     Part III abolishes or modifies certain existing crown privileges in respect of costs, executio;.., interpleader and attachment of debts, and accords exceptional treatment to the Crown in respect of certain matters where the special position of the Crown seems to demand such treatment, more especially In connection with the collection of the revenue and the discovery of documentsV.      The I e&quot;oranda originally laid before us by the Treasury and the Admiralty set out the grave objections felt by those Departments to the proposed changes, and
particularly to tho provisions of Part II of tho Bill. As a rssult of furthor consideration, the Departments concerned, including the Treasury and the Admiralty, are now agreed, that, subject to certain points of detail,  Parts I and III  of the Bill as drafted contain nothing to which from a purely Departmental point of view any objection can reasonably be taken.    At the same time,  the Departmental representatives desire to lay special emphasis on their unanimous opinion that the provisions in Part III of the Bill relating to the discovery and disclosure of documents by the Crown go tc the extreme limit of concession, and that it would be most dangerous if those provisions as now appearing in the Bill ware weakened in any degree.     It is pointed out that the provisions in question will be specially attacked by critics of the Bill, and that efforts will certainly be made to amend the Bill &quot;by transferring from the executive to the judiciary the duty of deciding whether it would 02* would not be contrary to the public interest to require the disclosure of official documents or information in the course of legal proceedings.Be     As regards Part II of the Bill,  a large majority of the Departmental representatives wore of opinion that the admission of a right of action in tort against the Grown was so complete a reversal of existing constitutional practice that it was difficult to estimate the measure of liability in whi&apos;..li it might involve the iSxchequer. After drawing attan &quot;-ion to the fact that the Governmentrs recent decision to ratify the Brussels Convention on the Immunity of State Owned Ships involves the admission of
the principle of the CrownTs liability in tort so far as Admiralty actions are concerned, the Departmental representatives thought that on the whole the wiser course would be not to proceed with Part II at the present moment but to wait until some experience had been gained of the practical working of Parts I and III.S.     We agree generally with the Departmental representa-tives that, subject to certain qualifications Parts I and III of the Bill as now drafted are unobjectionable and harmless.    The provisions of Part III relating to costs In Crown proceedings provide a remedy for a real grievance;    the other provisions of Parts I and III are designed to meet grievances which we believe to be illusory and due mainly to lack of knowledge of the procedure in litigation between the Crown and the subject. 3x it were certain that these Parts of the Bill could be passed into law in substantially their present form, we should be disposed to favour the introduction of legislation but we are informed by the Attorney-&apos;3eneral that in his view it would be quite impracticable to secure the passage of Parts I and III of the Bill through the House of Commons in their present form, and that in the course of its passage through that House most of the safeguards to which vital importance is attached - as for enanple those in clause SO respecting Discovery against the Crown - would almost certainly be deleted from the Bill In our opinion it would be unwise to introduce legislation unless the Government could be assured beforehand that all dangerous concessions could be effectively resisted;    and in view of the fact that the keenest critics of the safe-guarding provisions are to be found among the Governments
support&apos; r;v, wc do not see how19ouch ir,   scurcnccia possible10-It b k,o boon suggcsted thr.t it. would bo possibleto f.ttcmpt to deal separately with the question of ccstc in Crown proceedings, cither by Introducing a Bill limited to that subject, or by mr.lc.lng provision in the contemplated Judicature Bill.     It appears to us that a Bill dealing with the costs of Grown proceedings end not with the othc-r matters dealt with &quot;by tho How art Committee would be open to much criticism;  but the quc-c-tion of - legislating as to such costs, in a Judicature Bill, might bo further considered when such a Bill is in preparation.11 o Wo regard Part II of the Bill t:s dangerous,  forthe- reasons stated by the Depcrtmsnts, and also on account of the strong prejudice  gainst the Crown in legal proceed ings end the serious financial consequences which might rosu.lt from its enactment in certain circumstances, e*go a strike oi public servants..12. If, as v;o understand is probable, the recentBrusselo Convention on the Immunity of State Owned Ships is amended to meet certain objections raised by the British Governments, it will In our opinion be necessary to introduce- legislation in 1928 to ratify the Convention.      If the Convention is ratified the claims of the shipowners who ctg the most motive advocates of the. proposals under oonsi dorati on, will substantially be meto As to the remaining proposals of the draft Bill there appears to be little interest taken in tho matter-by the general public;  and it seems to us improbable that the
e^igoncies of the Parliamentary Titae Table will aamit o:f the introduction of legislation dealing with those proTJOSals  (which would probably he very conti*cversial) in the life time of the present Parliament 013- We accordingly report to the Cabinet(&apos;3.) That in the event of the draft Brussels Convention on tho Immunity of State Owned Ships &quot;being amenfisd to tho satisfaction of the British Government it may he necessary to introduce legislation to ratify tho Convention in I9P.8-f2) That the question of giving power to the Courts to deal at tlrcit1 discretion with the costs of proceedings by and against the Grows; he considered in connection with any Judicature Bill which   may &quot;be introduced next year*(3) That as regards the regaining proposalsof the Crown Proceedings Bill, while there would app. ar to he no possibility of introducing legislation on the lines of the provisions of the draft Bill in the present Parliament, the question might he furthe r. considered by the Cabinet towards the close of 1928*.Signed on behalf of the, Committee -CAVE.Ch airman*House of lordSo 28th.
