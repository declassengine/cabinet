Circulated by Direction of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.CP. 300 (27).MEMORANDUM FOR THE CABINET.Note by Sir Aitsten Cfuimberlain.IT is, I think, desirable that I should record what passed between King Feisal and me at yesterday&apos;s luncheon. I had carefully refrained from saying anything to the King about the negotiations, but towards the close of lunch the King opened the subject himself. He expressed his regret and disappointment that the negotia-tions had broken down, and his anxiety lest the result should be trouble in Iraq. I replied that I, too, regretted their failure, and was the more disappointed because after the long conference which Mr. Ormsby-Gore and I had held with His Majesty, I had really believed that success was well within our reach, but, I added, perhaps it was better to make no change at the present time. After all, the new State only came into existence eight or nine years ago. Such a period was nothing in the lifetime of a nation, and we might well find that, if we waited a year or two, such further progress would be made as would render easy the conclusion of such a new agreement as we had been unable to reach at the present time. As to what His Majesty had said about the possibility of disturbances, I felt confident that, if His Majesty would keep in close touch and consultation with the High Commissioner and gather about him the best advisers that his country could provide, he and his Government would have no difficulty in explaining the position satisfactorily to his people and in preserving peace and order.His Majesty then enquired whether, if the troops which we now had in Iraq were, in the opinion of the High Commissioner, insufficient to maintain order, His Majesty&apos;s Government would send reinforcements. I told His Majesty that we could not take engagements to cover a hypothetical case. He must trust to our doing what was necessary and proper if and when the emergency arose, but the real answer to his question lay in the facts of the case. As long as we had a High Commissioner and a body of British troops in Iraq, we could not be indifferent to their security, and any events external or internal which menaced their safety must necessarily closely concern us.His Majesty then enquired whether, speaking as Chamberlain and not as Secretary of State, I should be prepared to recommend an increase of forces if the High Commissioner demanded it. I replied that it was extremely difficult to answer such a question, as I could not take indirectly engagements Avhich His Majesty&apos;s Government were not prepared to take directly. Nevertheless, I observed, if His Majesty and his Government had followed the advice of the High Commissioner, and in consequence trouble arose which in the opinion of the High Commissioner required a reinforcement of our troops, I conceived that in such a case His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment would not hesitate to take action. On the other hand, if the trouble were caused through neglect to consult the High Commissioner or failure to follow his advice, His Majesty&apos;s Government might well tell the Government of Iraq that, as they had got themselves into trouble, so they must get themselves out.At this point I repeated briefly to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who was sitting on the other side of the King, the question which His Majesty had put to me and the reply which I had given, and the, Chancellor of the Exchequer expressed his concurrence. The King then said that, when he went back to Iraq, he would con-stantly consult the High Commissioner and closely follow his advice, and that he would get the High Commissioner to write him a letter once, a month to certify that he had, in fact, done as the High Commissioner wished. I at once told the King that that was not the way to deal with Englishmen. We behaved as gentlemen and liked to be treated as gentlemen. Let him be guided by the High Commissioner, who would receive, his instructions from His Majesty&apos;s Government, and let him have confidence in the friendship of His Majesty&apos;s Government4221   [16879][This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.] CONFIDENTIAL. Copy No.      30
The King, who had previously told me that he was leaving on Thursday, then said that, in consequence of this conversation, he would postpone his journey. He was prepared to reopen the negotiations and would await a communication from the !FIigh Commissioner. I informed His Majesty that the High Commissioner would be at his service at any time he chose to name, and I immediately informed Sir Stanley Wilson and Sir Henry Dobbs of what had passed between us. I understand that later in the afternoon the King saw the Chancellor of the Exchequer and Mr. Ormsby-Gore, and that he confirmed his desire to reopen the negotiations and expressed his readiness to abandon the claim to &apos;1 complete independence.&apos;&apos;A. C.Foreign Office, November 29, 1927.
