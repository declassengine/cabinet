In accordance vith the Prime Minister&apos;s instructions, v/e met on Thursday at 3 pcnu, to consider the Draft Treaty of Alliance between Great Britain and Egypt (Paper No0 C5&apos;,0*S. 109). In order to assist us In cur examination of this Treaty the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs very kindly arranged to attend our meeting.
2o     The main points on which we were anxious to secure the vie^sof the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs were in regard to Articles VI and VII of the draft Treaty, and may, together with the substance of his answers, be briefly summarised as follows. Article VI.(a) Question.     This article does not definitely stipulate that when His Britannic Majesty is at war,Egypt shall also be at war, as is the proposed arrange-ment.between the United States of America and Panama-. In the absence of such a stipulation, in the event of Sgypt remaining neutral, Is then &quot; not a possibility of our Forces in that country being interned?Answer.     The articlo not only covers the case of His Britannic Majesty being at war but also that cf being menaced with war.     In both these contingencies the Article requires that Egypt shall behave, not merely as a neutral, but as an ally nnd render every assistance in her po*er.     This being the case the legal opinion is that no question of interning British Forces in Egypt can arise.Article VII.(b) Question.     Can the first paragraph of article VII be interpreted by the Egyptian Government as a definite undertaking that at some future date we will withdraw all our forces from Egypt and entrust Its defence to the Egyptian Forces only?Answer.     The effect of the paragraph Is that at no time can we be deprived of the right to maintainO *&quot; *0 &quot;&quot;&quot;
forces in Egypt, except by our own consent.     Nor can the paragraph be interpreted either as a pledge that we will at any time remove our forces out of Eg7/pt, or that His Majesty&apos;s Government have ever entertained such an intention.(c) Question.     Under the second paragraph of Article VII, will It be competent for the Egyptian Government to ask us to move our forces, not only from Cairo, but also from other important centres in Egypt -including the Canal Zone, and to place them In new sites suggested by themselves, and if v:e refuse, can they appeal to the League of Nations.?Answer.      The whole question in regard to this partcf the Treaty has turned cn the location of BritishTroops at Cairo and Alexandria,     By the first paragraphof this Article \;e are granted the right to remain in -Egypt to protect our lines cf communication.     Lines ofcommunication in this case have been defined, not only as the Suez Canal but also those which run through egypt to the Sudan.     There has never been any suggestion thatour troops - if removed from Cairo,  should go anvwheretoelse in Egypt but/the Canal Zone.     Having regard to tho whole tenur    of Article VII,  it is incredible that any tribunal, to whom the matter might be referred,  could rule that our troops should be so placed as to be out of reach of the Canal,(d) fel^Li^ix-i&quot;     In ^iie event of the matter being brought before the League of Nations, having regard to the fact that the vote of the British Delegates does not count, -is there any risk of the decision being givon against us?
Answer.     The decision of the Council will havo to be unanimous (excluding the Votes of Great Britiin and ofEgypt),     If, at the time, we consider the retention oftroops at Cairo a necessity, it will be because therewill not be sufficient security in the situation in Egypt.This ?.ack of security will be shared by the foreigncommunities in Egypt, and will presumably be the subjectof representation to their respective Governments.     an adverse decision en the part of the whole Council istherefore extremely unlikely, and cculd becomevmlya possibility/in the event cf   our having alienated the sympathies cf all the Powers represented on the Council.      In these circumstances it Is inconceivable that we ran the slightest risk of being over-ruled on the point.(e) Question f      Is It not the case that, under the Terms of the Treaty the Egyptian Government can raise an Army of any size and arm it from any foreign source?Answer,     The Terms of the Treaty do not prevent the Egyptian Government from raising an Army of any size, but it is the last thing that they wixl try and dc0(f) Question.      Is taere any clause which lays down the duration of the Treaty?Answer.     The whole Treaty is in perpetuity without any limit of time.     If Egypt denounced the Treaty we could refer the matter to the League of Nationso(g) Question,     Annex 1(a).     Doos the reference to the maintenance of British personnel &quot;on the existing 3cale&quot; in the Egyptian Army refer to numbers or to proportion?^LSJE?.E&apos;     Numbers.     An alteration has, according to telephonic advice from Paris, been agreed to by Sarwat Pasha substituting &quot;with their present functions&quot;for &quot;on tho terms&quot; in this paragraph.
(h.)   Question.   Is there anything In the Treaty or in the Covenant of the league (when Sgypt becomes a member) which would make the Loague of nations the arbiter   of whother the defar.ee of our lines of communication should &quot;bo handed over to the Egyptian Government?Answer.     b&apos;o.Owing to the many purely political considera-tions Involved, we feel we can do no more than emphasise the very groat importance of the suez canal as a vxtal lrrus. xu cur imperial ccmraunioations and to point to:some of the consequences which any diminution in the security of this link will entail.      These consequences will not be confined to measures in or near Egypt alone, but will be spread over a very wide area and will affect almost evory portion of the Smpire.       Should there be any risk of freo communication through tho Canal being severed or menaced, It follows that our Naval --forces cn each side of the Suez Isthmus may have to be regarded as self contained and separate entities, and provision made in each hemisphere to meet the needs of theso separate entities;    for example, Singapore may have to be strengthened to render it less dependent on home supplies and support.Apart from the actual dispositions of our Eaval forces, it will be necessary to reconsider our cruiser^1 destroyer and submarine strengthsFurther, the alternative route to the 3ast via the Cape will immediately assume greater importance, with consequent increases to the garrisonsand armaments of the essential bases lying along this route.      ffor examplo, it may become necessary to review the recent decision in regard to the defended part of Sierra leone.
Last!?/ tho possible reactions on the scale of defence in the Overseas Dominions of South Africa, Australia, New Zealand ond in India mus*; not be overlooked.4.    It is for His ;&apos;s.ies &apos;r,s Government ho decide whether the increased risk to the security of the Canal and the possible conseouences, which nay result if Article VII and its annexe are approved in their present form, outweigh the political advantages which are claimed for the Treaty.(Signed)    H.  f EZvTOHARD.CHARLES S. -&apos;ADuDF.
