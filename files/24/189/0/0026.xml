[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government. I--- 157CONFIDENTIAL. Copy No.    ^CP. 276 (27).ANGLO-AMERICAN RELATIONS.(Circulated to the Cabinet by Direction of the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs.)[A 6341/133/45]Sir E. Howard to Sir Austen Chamberlain. (Received October 31.) (No. 1846.)Sir, Washington, October 20, 1927.I HAVE the honour to transmit herewith copy of a despatch from His Majesty&apos;s consul-general at Boston, enclosing the text of a leading article in the &quot;Boston Herald &quot; of the 5th October, entitled &quot;Language and Understanding.&quot;2. You will observe that the &quot; Herald,&quot; usually a paper most friendly to Great Britain, speaks with considerable resentment of the valedictory to the American Legion visitors to England published by the &quot;Chronicle,&quot; which, it points out, is not calculated to cement the brotherhood between Great Britain and the United States of America.I have, &amp;c.ESME HOWARD.Enclosure. Consul-General Gray to Sir E. Howard.(No. 127.)    .Sir, Boston, October 5, 1927.I HAVE the honour to transmit herewith the enclosed copy of an editorial in the &quot; Boston Herald &quot; of the 5th October, headed &quot;Language and Understanding,&quot;* and dealing Avith Anglo-American relations.2. Mr. Daniels, of the English-Speaking Union in New York, is criticised for what is popularly called &quot;hot air&quot; a criticism which executive members of the Boston branch of the English-Speaking Union have been heard to share. The editorial indicates as did one or two Boston editorials at the time of the Geneva Disarmament Conference that war between the two countries is not deemed an &quot;impossibility&quot; in certain eventualities for instance, British Admiralty cruiser restriction of American trade as neutrals in a forthcoming war. Reference is also made to an editorial in the London &quot; Chronicle &quot; whose description of the American Legion visitors is deplored. Last night&apos;s &quot;Transcript&quot; also recalled a sentence in a recent English publication on Anglo-American intercourse: &quot;Those whom providence has kept apart let no man join together.&quot;I have, &amp;c.EDWARD F. GRAY.* Not pinnted.4192   [16801]
