(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC I ;AJSSTYT s GOVERNMENT ).C R E T.Copy No..264 (27).CABINETCROWN PROCEEDINGS BILL.Memorandum by the Postmaster General.1.7/ith reference to Cabinet Conclusion No. 5 of2nd November, 1927, I had intended to acquaint the Crown Proceedings Report Committee v/ith my views on the Crown Proceedings Bill so far as the Post Office is concerned, but the Committee reported to the Cabinet before I was in a position to do 30.     I therefore put my views to the Cabinet for purposes of record and future reference should occasion arise.2. Clause 11(6) of this Bill proposes to effect animportant change in the law governing the payment of compensation for the loss of registered packets by repealing the exemption from liability which the Postmaster General at present possesses under Section 13 of the Post Office Act, 1908.3. It may be observed at the outset that a3 any claim for compensation would be based rather on the quasi-contraot created by the payment and acceptance of a registration fee than upon tort, it would seem more appropriate to alter the law, if alteration is required, by an amendment of the Post Office Act rather than by a clause in a Bill dealing with Crown proceedings.4. As regards the inland registration service, thepractical results would probably not be considerable, but nevertheless
nevertheless I view the ohange with some apprehension. Nearly 60 million registered paokets (letters and parcels) pass through the inland post yearly, and it is obviously impossible to impose any check upon the sender1s statement of value or contents either at the time of posting or of delivery.     The evidence necesoary to disprove a fraudulent claim for loss or damage of contents as distinct from total loss is inherently difficult to obtain and it would seldom be worth while to contest such claims in Court, however strong the suspicion of fraud might be. The aooeptanoe of legal liability would probably lead to an appreciable increase in fraudulent claims.      In any event, it is assumed that the Postmaster General would be empowered by regulation to prescribe conditions as to adequate packing etc., e.g., the existing rule that in case of claims for damage the actual packing must be produced for inspection, and that compensation is not payable for exceptionally fragile articles enclosed in registered packets, and could disclaim liability where these conditions were not complied with.5. But in addition to the inland service the PostmasterGeneral is a party to three foreign services which give rise to far greater complications, i.e., the Foreign Registered Post, the Foreign Insured Letter Post and the Foreign Insured Parcel Post, the first two of which are governed by the International Convention and Insured Letter Agreement of the Postal Union, and the third by agreements with the foreign Administrations concerned. These services differ widely in the limits of compensation and in the circumstances and conditions under which compensation is payable, but they have this in
in common, that the liability to compensate is invariably imposed upon the country in which the loss occurs, and that country alone is entitled to decide without appeal whether a claim shall or shall not be admitted.     Stress i3 laid in the published regulations on the fact that the responsibility of the British Post Office ceases on the transfer of an insured packet to another Administration, which can, even in the case of an admitted loss, repudiate liability on grounds such as force majeure.     Clause 11 of the Bill would appear to make the Postmaster General liable to pay compensation for losses occurring outside his territory and outBide his control, even in cases where the Administration responsible for the loss has disclaimed liability. This seems not only illogical but inconsistent with the international agreements regulating these services. A further point affecting the Post Office arises in Clause 12(b).      Claims for considerable sums are periodically received in respect of the salvage of mails and are rejected, but if it were held that mails were cargo belonging to the Crown,  such claims would apparently have to be admitted.     Moreover, the Post Office might be involved in payments of large sums for general average in respect of parcel mails for which liability is at present repudiated.(Intld.)
