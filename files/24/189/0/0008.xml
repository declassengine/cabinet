BELLIGERENT RIGHTS AT SEA AND THE RELATIONS BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND GREAT BRITAIN.AS one result of the failure of the Three-Power Naval Conference, I was led to consider what was the real ground for the apparently unreasonable attitude of the United States towards the British proposals for limitation of armaments. This consideration quickly brought me to the conclusion that the difference between us centred in the use which we make of our naval forces to enforce our view of the rights of a belligerent at sea. This at once raised the question whether it was desirable, and, if desirable, possible, to attempt to reach an agreement with the United States upon the disputed points of international law. On my return home I found that the same problem had been raised independently alike in private letters from the Ambassador at Washington and within the Foreign Office itself.Sir Esme Howard had set out his views in two private and confidential letters to Sir William Tyrrell, which I print for the information of the Cabinet (Appendix I).I set out my own line of thought in the memorandum which is printed as Appendix II, and in Appendix III will be found a memorandum by Mr. Craigie which gives a much more detailed examination of the points of difference between ourselves and the Americans, and the possibility of reconciling them.I know the immense difficulties which surround this question, and I realise that there must be a most careful examination of all that is involved before any such negotiations could be undertaken, but I hold strongly that the examination ought to be made and that the new factors introduced hy the rise of United States naval and financial power and by the cost and extent of modern warfare must be taken into account. It cannot be denied that the present difference on this subject between the United States and ourselves is the only matter which makes war between our two nations conceivable. But I go further; I believe that General Preston Brown does not exaggerate when he says that any attempt by us to enforce our rights in a future war where the United States were neutral, as we enforced them in the late war, would make war between us &quot; probable.&quot; The world position has been altered to our disadvantage, and what was possible in the past may have become impossible for the future. I would, therefore, urge that the question should be referred for consideration by a special Committee of the Cabinet or the C.I.D. I am advised that, if it should appear that there is any possibility of entering upon pourparlers or negotiations with the United States, the sooner we can take action the better would be our chances of success.A. C.October 26, 1927.4169   [16728]
Appendix I.(Private and Confidential.)My dear Tyrrell, Manchester, Mass., September 15, 1927.IN your letter of the 30th August you say that our American friends arc clearly determined to secure themselves against interference by us in the event of their being neutrals in a war in which we are engaged, and you don&apos;t quite see how we are going to prevent them.Well, as you may imagine, I have pondered much over this problem, which is one that we may at any moment be called on to solve. If we are called on Lu face it in the middle of a war, our people will not be in a mental condition to face it reasonably because we shall all be afflicted with war mentality. It is better, therefore, to try and face it in peace time and as soon as possible.Now there will next time, if ever, we are at war be in regard to this matter a choice of three alternatives only as far as this country is concerned - 1st. To attempt to prosecute a blockade, as in 1914-18, in spite of this country, and risk the financial and economic consequences. I cannot believe that we should be quite so mad as to push our blockade so far as to make this country actually join our enemies, and so bring about, as it seems to me, the certain disruption of the Empire. All the same I don&apos;t feel quite sure even about this, remembering what some of our blockade &quot; fans &quot; during the last war were prepared to take on in order to prevent cotton, &amp;c, from reaching Germany.2nd. To arrange with this country beforehand the limits to which we could go in the blockade, so as to make sure that we should not have to count with trouble from a hostile United States.3rd. To settle the principles of blockade by International Conference in accord-ance with the rules of International Law, as established before 1914, accepting and defining the doctrine of &quot; Continuous Voyage.&quot;In exchange for this, however, we should obtain from the same treaty universal acceptance of our thesis of the illegality of the sinking by submarines of merchant vessels, whether neutral or belligerent, or, better still, of the use of submarines at all for the purpose of dealing in any way with merchant vessels. This would relieve us of a terrible nightmare and make it really almost impossible to starve us out.I do not pretend to have done more than think this out in a very superficial way. But although many difficulties suggest themselves I believe that the third alternative does offer the best basis for 1. Naval disarmament and, hence, economy.2. Placing relations with this country on a basis which will make it almost impossible to produce any serious matter of conflict between us hence, a better condition for permanent peace in the Pacific and elsewhere.3. Removal of much of the jealousy which exists against Great Britain throughout the world.4. Removal of the nightmare of Great Britain being starved by submarine action.I had come to these conclusions, as I say, after pondering over the Geneva Conference, when the other day Colonel House came to lunch with us.He at once attacked the Geneva Conference problem, and agreed with me that any satisfactory settlement on the basis of &quot; parity &quot; was out of the question, the needs of the two countries being so different. I showed him Grey&apos;s letter in the &quot; Times &quot; of the 11th August, with which he entirely agreed. He then went on to say that there was only one possible source of war between our two countries, and this was British interference with American neutral trade. I knew, of course, from his book that he took this view, but was not prepared for his propounding it so vigorously. He made it quite clear to me and in this I am sure he was not exaggerating that Republicans and Democrats are at one on this point of never again allowing American neutral shipping to be interfered with as in 1914-17. He asked me if it would not be possible for us to settle this question of the &quot; freedom of the seas &quot; now once and for all with the United States, and thus eliminate a great danger of collision in the future.
He emphasised that this would be really an immense advantage to us because, first, it would enable us to ensure our overseas communications and food supply as nothing else would; and, second, it would not be a great sacrifice, because it was unlikely that there would ever be another war like the last with a country like Germany, which was blockaded on both sides by land, which fact alone rendered the sea blockade effective.I replied that, speaking for myself, entirely, I agreed with him in principle (you must have realised by now that I am, indeed, the pink of indiscretion), but that 1 thought the moment had not yet come to make any move. I particularly deprecated any move being made by America at present, and thought that perhaps next year when I went over to London I might take up the question verbally with the Secretary of State and perhaps the Prime Minister.He asked me if he should mention it to the President. I begged him not to do so now. It would be necessary, if the matter ever was discussed at all, to hear what men like Senators Borah, Moses and Swanson had to say about it. Personally, I thought they would agree; but I insisted that in any case there could be no question of any settlement in the sense he advocated unless the submarine danger was also eliminated.He entirely agreed, and again stated that nothing Avould do so much to prepare the way for naval disarmament as this. He went so far as to say that he believed that all other countries would reduce their navies to a minimum, leaving us to do what we liked, if only there could be an international settlement on these lines. I said I thought this was too optimistic, but I felt it was certain that it would remove one of the principal difficulties in the way of naval disarmament.House, of course, does not any longer cut any ice politically, but I am confident that he is quite justified in saying that Democrats and Republicans are agreed on this point, and in the main I think his arguments are sound and logical.1 should like to know in due course what you think of the above.Yours ever,ESME HOWARD.(Private and Confidential.)My dear Tyrrell, . Manchester, Mass., September 22, 1927.With reference to my letter of the loth instant, which I foolishly forgot to send by the last bag, and which, therefore, only goes by this week&apos;s messenger, I enclose a memorandum of a conversation between General Preston Brown, commanding at Boston, and our military attache, on the subject of blockade. This shows that fear of future blockade is at the back of the minds not only of Senators but also of generals, and no doubt of admirals. How much wiser it would have been if the United States Government had made this clear to us before launching us into the Geneva Conference. Anyhow, now we really know where we stand, and it is time we considered seriously whether we should just let things slide till a crisis arises, when it will be very difficult to come to an agreement, or try quietly and without any fuss to reach some preliminary agreement with the United States prior to getting the rules of blockade settled by international law. It seems to me that this, if we think some action advisable, should be our mode of procedure. We must, however, be careful not to propose this directly to the United States Government, as the United States authorities will at once be filled with suspicion that we are out to &quot; pull the wool &quot; over their eyes. The proposal must be made to come from them. This, however, does not present any serious difficulties. The question is, whether, if Kellogg or the President does make any suggestion to me in this sense, I should express willingness to submit it to the Secretary of State (Sir Austen, I mean). Personally, I think I ought to do so, because I believe that, by coming to an agreement on this thorny question with the United States, Great Britain&apos;s loss i.e., the right of unlimited blockade involving the hostility of the United States will be more than compensated by the gain i.e., the removal of all danger of hostile interference by the &quot;United States and the certainty of obtaining the supplies and the credits we need from the United States while, if we can also include eventually an arrangement for the prohibition of the use of the submarine for blockade purposes, we shall be relieved of a tremendous incubus. The blockade, oven as exercised in the last war, is, anyhow, a weapon which is only effective after a very long war and can we stand another long war ?   Will any other war last for
four years ? A.ny move in restraint of blockade and of submarine activities is likely to be welcomed by nearly all European Powers, and I think even France and Italy, who might raise objections to the second point, i.e., restriction of submarine activities, would have to bow to general public opinion. I don&apos;t know what Japan would do, but I take it she would agree.There is also this to be considered. The United States at present is in the mood for restricting the powers of blockade, but when it comes to have a super-fleet, as it will in ten or twenty years, will it be so keen on this subject? Will it not be like Great Britain for the last two hundred years, anxious for complete liberty of action in time of war ? Will not the positions be completely reversed ? It may well be that, unless the powers of blockade are determined shortly by international law, we shall be the ones who press for restrictions which we shall then find it impossible to persuade the United States to agree to. Our people at home may imagine that this is looking too far ahead to be practical politics. I am not, however, at all sure of this, seeing the rapidity of the growth of national pride in this country. Anyhow, I feel that this question of the freedom of the seas cannot be burked much longer. If it is not brought up by the United States, it will be brought up by Germany or one of the smaller Powers in the League of Nations. It is, I think, essential that we should have an understanding with the United States about it before this happens, and the present seems to be a not unpropitious time to lead up to conversations which will lead up to such an understanding.Perhaps you might show these, two letters to the Secretary of State. I have not dared to write to him, as I have been writing him such long private letters that I feel if I go on they will deserve to lie unopened in a heap on his table, like Walter Page&apos;s to President Wilson (vide Colonel House&apos;s memoirs, or is it Walter Page&apos;s ?).Yours ever,ESME HOWARD.H.E.,I submit the following memorandum of a conversation with General Preston Brown on the.outeome of the Geneva Conference: 1. By invitation of Major-General Preston Brown, commanding 1st Corps Area (Boston), I visited him at Fort Ethan Allen from the 24th to 26th August in order to inspect the troops training at that post.2. General Preston Brown is an experienced and educated soldier. Fie has read and thought a great deal about war, and has not allowed Ins mind to lie fallow since he left the University of Y&quot;ale to enter the American army some thirty-three years ago. In the late war he saw something of the British army in France, and has retained happy recollections of his contact with it. He gives me the impression of being a Southern gentleman, very friendly to England, and with genuine apprecia-tion of what the British Empire stands for. He, has been most courteous to my predecessor and to me; my relations with him are cordial and almost intimate, as we find that we have many interests in common.3. On the evening of the 25th August, when I was sitting alone with him in his room at Fort Ethan Allen discussing some questions of the. late war m wdiich we were both interested, I guided the conversation to the subject of the Geneva Conference to find out how an American soldier of his type had reacted to the breakdowm of the conference.  What he said amounts to this : 4. The conference failed because neither side would tell the truth ; you (British) want numerous cruisers not only to protect your trade routes wdiich is obvious  but in order to apply in war your historic weapon of blockade. Small cruisers can do that. We (Americans) want a smaller number of big cruisers to ensure that your blockade does not interfere with our commerce as a neutral. The 10,000-ton cruisers are necessary to us to break your blockade. This country is never again going to put up with what it had to put up with in 1914-15 from both sides. It was the mercy of God and the co-operation of Walter Page and Grey that kept America from coming in on the wrong side last time. Next time He may not be so kind, and Page and Grey aren&apos;t there, You have no idea how remote we were from the war. In 1914 I was in the Philippines, and in 1915 in Texas, and all we knew of the war there was that British cruisers were stopping American trade and German sub-marines were sinking our people. If the. Germans had not made that mistake we would have come in on the wrong; side.
5385. General Preston Brown made it clear to me that, in his opinion, war between Great Britain and the United States was &quot; unthinkable &quot; only as a result of disagree-ment between those two Powers alone; as an issue arising out of a state of war between Great Britain and a third party, he considered it &quot; probable,&quot; unless Great Britain modifies her practice of blockade so as to conform with the wishes of the United States.6. To my remark that, if that was the case, it would be a pity to wait until national passions were at white heat before trying to come to an understanding on the question of blockade, he replied that the blockade question could not be taken up between the two countries too soon &quot;before the anti-British hot-air campaign gets going.&quot; He added : &quot;We know all about blockade in this country. I remember the South after the Civil War. It is a thing we ought to be able to agree about, as we too may not always be neutrals and may want to use the weapon ourselves as we have in the past.&quot;7. I would like to emphasise the. fact that throughout this conversation General Preston Brown spoke about Great Britain and British policy in a most friendly, and indeed sympathetic, way. The impression he left on me was that of a friend anxious to open my eyes to the danger of living in a fool&apos;s paradise by assuming that war between our two countries sis &quot;unthinkable,&quot; when, as a matter of fact, in the eventuality which he indicated, it is &quot; probable,&quot; unless steps are taken now to clear up the question of blockade.R. POPE-HENNESSY, Colonel,Military A attache.Manchester, Mass., September 20, 1927.Appendix II. Memorandum by the Secretary of State.Sir W. Tyrrell,I AM much interested by Sir Esme&apos;s letters of the 15th and 20th September.As you know from our first conversation on my return, my mind had been occupied by the same problem and had reached very similar conclusions. I had, indeed, already spoken to the Prime Minister about it at our meeting at Talloirs, and he recurred to it on my return home in consequence of a conversation which he had had with Mr. Vansittart.It may be useful that I should summarise my own line of thought. It was as follows : (i.) The United States entered the recent conference with a plan of naval limitation rather hastily put together, proceeding from no principle (unless &quot; parity &quot; be dignified with that name), and based on no clear strategic view of America&apos;s policy or needs.(ii.) Only late in the discussions did they become aware of their real case, viz., that whilst;&apos; parity,&quot; when interpreted to mean equality of numbers or tonnage, might be necessary to satisfy national pride, but had no basis in strategic necessity, our small cruisers were the instruments of our blockade policy and not, as we claimed, a purely defensive force. It would seem to me that our representatives were so preoccupied about our food supplies that they had really failed to take the offensive tasks of the small cruisers into consideration at all.(iii.) Blockade is, therefore, at the root of our difference with the United States over naval limitation, and is the one question which might lead to war between us. Unless they are belligerents, the United States will never again submit to such a blockade as we enforced in the Great War.(iv.) After every considerable war, military and naval authorities are prone to think in terms of that war till another has been fought, teaching new lessons. Now it is extremely unlikely that, if and when we are ago in engaged in a serious war, the conditions governing the application of blockade will be at all comparable to those of the last great struggle, in which all the great land frontiers of our enemies were closed to trade. The present tendency is to exaggerate the potency of the blockade weapon, even when the attitude of the United States is left out of account.
(v.) But it cannot be thus excluded from consideration, for (a.) The United States have the means and the will to create a navy equal to our own. Their one existing difficulty is men. If there is no agreement between us, they will in time get the men by developing, at no matter what cost, their mercantile marine. We shall, therefore, stimulate a double rivalry naval and mercantile.(b.) If we are engaged in a life and death struggle such as the last, it would be suicidal to add the United States to our enemies. What-ever we contend are our rights, we cannot, in fact, afford to exercise them if it involves war with the United States when the United States possesses a navy equal in combative force to our own, and we are at war with a first-class Power.(c.) But it is not even necessary for the United States to declare war to bring us to destruction. They have only to refuse us supplies and credits in order to deal us a fatal blow.(vi.) Not all these arguments apply with equal force to minor conflicts, but the blockade weapon is itself of less consequence to us in such lesser wars and Ave can in such cases more readily abandon our extremer claims.(vii.) Whilst hitherto Ave, whether as neutrals or belligerents, have consistently supported the highest dectrine of belligerent rights, the attitude of the United States has been inconstant. They haAe put those rights high when they were belligerents; they have sought to minimise them when they Avere neutrals. But now that they have with us the equal-largest navy of the world and like us a Aery small army; now that with the groAvth of their international interests they are less certain of being always neutrals, their interests approach our own and this approach should render agreement betAveen us more easy. Our great Aveapon is their great weapon. They must ask themselves the same question as we have put to ourselves and answered : Sea-poAver being our great strength and decisive Aveapon, shall we bear with the sacrifices wdiich its assertion by others entails when AAe are neutrals, i.e., the majority of cases, in order to keep it effective for the rare occasions upon Avhich it is our only means of salvation, or shall we take the risk of not being able to use it Avhen its use is Autal sooner than suffer the inconAenience of its use by others in circumstances in which that use may cause us some loss and annoyance, but can do us no vital injury?Differing here from Sir Esme, I should say that the higher the United States will put belligerent rights, the better for us, but their doctrines must be the same in peace and in war.I am strongly in favour of an endeavour to reach agreement with them and that as early as possible. The first.step is to get our own ideas clear in the Foreign Office; next to approach the Cabinet and/or the Committee of Imperial Defence. Only then can A\e open discussions with the United States of America in Avhatever manner may seem best.It Avill be seen that 1st. I reject the first of the alternati\es stated by Sir Esme in his letter of the 15th, i.e., to pursue a blockade policy regardless of the United States of America,2nd. That I approve his second, i.e., to endeavour to come to an agreement with them.3rd. I Avould reserve consideration of the suggestion for an international conference until A\e see the result of our pourparlers with the United States. Incidentally is not Sir Esme making a rather bold assumption Avhen he speaks in this connection of &quot;the rules of International LaAv as established before 1914 . . . .&quot;? Was there in fact any general agreement as to these rules ? Perhaps he is thinking only of the measure of agreement then reached between the United States and oursehes. This in any case would be the starting-point for any reconsideration of our position.Sir Esme should be supplied with a copy of Mr. Malkin&apos;s valuable article on the Declaration of Paris.(Initialled)        A.

Action suggested        ... ... ... ... ... ...      16I. Premises.IN approaching this problem it is perhaps permissible to take the following premises for granted : 1. It will not be possible for this country as a belligerent to enforce against the United States as a neutral any strong measures in furtherance of a blockade or the seizure of contraband, without first arriving at an under-standing with the United States Government, unless those measures fall incontestably within the recognised rights of a belligerent.2. Any such understanding would be more easily reached in a period of peace, when the United States must necessarily consider its position as a potential belligerent, than in a period of war, during which the United States, if a neutral, is inclined to view the matter exclusively from the standpoint of a defender of neutral&apos;rights.3. On the outbreak of a war in which we but not the United States are involved, the first acts of detention and capture affecting American vessels and cargoes would, in the absence of any previous understanding, create an atmosphere of resentment and hostility in the United States ill-suited to the conclusion of any satisfactory agreement with this country.4. The existence of an Anglo-American agreement on this subject would have an arresting influence on the further development of the American navy, for the wind would to some extent be taken out of the sails of the &quot; big navalists &quot; in the United States.II. Grounds for thinking United States Government may not proveUncompromising.As evidence that the United States may be disposed in the future to take a less doctrinnaire view of the whole question than that exhibited during the Avar in the Lansing notes, I would mention (a) the final decision of President Wilson not to raise the &quot; freedom of the seas &quot; issue at the Peace Conference, although he Avas influenced also by the idea that the League would cause neutrality to disappear, and (b) the conclusion of the recent Anglo-American War Claims &quot;Agreement, Avhich removed one of the best means open to the United States of keeping the issue alive for future use against this country.While it is probable that the American attitude at the recent Geneva Conference Avas consciously or unconsciously determined anyhow in its middle and later stages  by the possibility of friction with this country over some future &quot; blockade &quot; issue, and the determination to have a more decisive say next time, it does not necessarily follow that the United States Government would prove intractable in any negotia-tions designed to remove this possible cause of future trouble.A
In illustration of the tendency of American naval opinion to depart from the strictly orthodox United States attitude on these questions, the following opinion expressed by Rear-Admiral W. L. Rogers, U.S.N., in the &quot; American Journal of International Law,&quot; is of interest: &quot; The United States should reconsider its old stand for a rule favouring neutral commerce and lean rather towards one favouring the Allied practices in the late war . . . .&quot;A further point to be remembered is that the American blockade notes were despatched in the heat of a contest during which the State Department was indulging in a species of legalistic orgy. Many of the points made are never likely to be heard of again. Indeed the majority of their representations were directed against alleged abuses under our &quot;blockade&quot; measures rather than against the measures themselves.III. Possible Necessity for Modification of Traditional British AttitudeTurning to our own interests in this matter, it is undeniable that the whole situation in regard to the exercise of our belligerent rights at sea has been profoundly modified by the claim and probable determination of the United States to reach an equality of sea power with the Empire. This claim has been admitted in so far as battleships and battle-cruisers are concerned. It has been virtually admitted also for cruisers and auxiliary craft, for there is apparently no intention to engage upon a race with the United States in the construction of subsidiary naval armaments. Even if (as is probable) the United States Government do not immediately build up to our cruiser strength, they will endeavour gradually to approach it and probably to surpass it in the heavier type of cruiser. To maintain the traditional position of British naval dominance or to think from such a premise in the future is, in already existing circumstances, no longer possible.Whenever &quot;this problem of the exercise of our belligerent rights at sea has been under review by any British Government it may safely be assumed the discussions have always proceeded upon the basis that this country will be able to establish at once and to maintain an unquestioned command of the sea, untrammelled by any serious menace from neutrals. If for this reason alone, it seems worth examining whether the traditional British attitude on the question of interference with belligerent and neutral commerce does not, or must not, need some revision. Moreover, the development of the submarine menace and other important changes in the methods of conducting naval warfare render it doubtful whether a &quot;blockade&quot; in the proper sense of the word can ever be made effective in future wars. The balance between a legal right to enforce a stringent blockade and a legal right to guarantee our food supplies in time of Avar lends itself anyhow to varying appreciations, and the relative advantages seem to call for constant revision to keep pace with the changing conditions of naval Avarfare and of the economic situation of this country.The Committee of Imperial Defence &quot;Advisoiy Committee on Trading and Blockade in Time of War &quot; has not yet examined the aboAre questions from the more purely naval point of vieAV, and, before Ave can get much further in the matter, it is important that such an investigation should be made. What we really AATant to get at is a clear and exhaustiA&apos;e statement as to the measures which the Admiralty are able and Avould want (within the limits of international laAV and altered circumstances) to enforce in any future Avar in order to exert &quot;sea pressure.&quot; For the purpose of such an enquiry it Avould be necessary to examine the differing situations arising in any Avar in AAdiioh this country might conceivably be engaged. Broadly speaking, such possible future wars are divisible into four main categories : (a.) A duel betAA&apos;een oursehes and one other nation without the inteiwention of the League.(&amp;.) A Avar in which several nationals are engaged without the intervention of the League.(c.) A League Avar in which Ave are engaged as one of the coercing PoAvers. (d.) A League Avar in which Ave are the CoA&apos;lieutenant-breaking PoAver.
yIt is clear that in case (a) the exercise of our right to stop goods from passing to our enemy through a host of neutral States would, be relatively more difficult than in cases (ft) and (c), and an indication as to how the Admiralty would propose to exert sea pressure in case (a) is especially important. It would also be necessary to know whether, in all these situations, the Admiralty consider that we could or should exercise to the full the rights at present recognised by international law, or whether it might now be to our advantage to endeavour, by international agreement, to restrict the full exercise of those rights by others.IV. Practices emerging from the War.In the absence of further data on these points it is only possible in this paper to estimate the chances of an agreement with the United States Government on the basis of the practices which emerged from the enforcement of the &quot; blockade &quot;during the late war. These practices probably represent the maximum which a prize court could be expected to uphold, so that the result of the proposed investigation could scarcely be in favour of increasing (though it might be in favour of decreasing) their severity. Regarded, therefore, as a maximum, they form an interesting basis of comparison with American precept and practice. If an agreement with the United States appears not impossible with our claims placed at the highest level, its conclusion would be pro tanto simplified by any recession from these maximum demands. It is proposed briefly to outline each of the principal measures which His Majesty&apos;s Government would probably take for the interception of private property at sea, to summarise under each heading the objections raised by the United States Government during the war, arid to estimate the chances of future agreerhent with the United States Government with or without modification of our existirig attitude.V. Analysis of (1) Probable future British Practice; (2) United States Objections to British Practice during the War; (3) Possibilities of Agreement with the United States.Contraband.i. Visit, Search, Detention and Capture.(a.) British Practice. The generally, accepted precepts of international law (in particular the provisions of the Declaration of Paris, 1856, and the principles underlying the Washington Convention of 1923, respecting the Protection of the Lives of Neutrals and Non-Combatants at Sea) to apply so long as they are observed by other belligerents. (For the position in the event of a flagrant breach of these provisions, see under &quot;Reprisals&quot; below.) An enemy vessel to be captured. A neutral vessel to be diverted to a convenient port for an investigation into the nature and destination of her cargo. The period of detention to last until it has been decided whether proceedings should be instituted against her or her cargo. Vessels carrying cargo covered by navicert &quot; permit (see under &quot; Navioert &quot; below) to receive special facilities. Period of detention for all innocent vessels arid cargoes to be the shortest possible.(b.) United States Objections during the War. The United States Government during the early stages of the war insisted on search at sea instead of at a British port, maintaining that the policy of diversion without examination at sea arid merely on suspicion of the existence of contraband was contrary to international law. The United States Government further considered that the detention of innocent vessels and cargoes was in many cases unreasonably long.(c.) Possibilities of Agreement.-A.?, regards diversion, His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment urged during the war with much force that under modern conditions the right of search could only be exercised in port, especially in view of the elaborate arrangements in force for concealing the identity of cargoes. Moreover, the growth of the size of steariiships necessitated their being taken into calm water to be searched. A similar course was pursued in the American Civil War, and the necessity of giving the belligerent captor full liberty to establish enemy destination by all the evidence at his disposal was recognised by the American Prize Courts during that war.To the above arguments riiay be added the ever-increasing danger of submarine attack on a vessel coriducting or undergoing search on the high seas; also the fact that the legality of deviation was recognised in various prize court decisions during the war.
Unless the policy of the United States Government is to do away altogether with the right to search neutral vessels, there should be no serious difficulty in reaching an agreement with them on this point.2. Seizure. Doctrine of Continuous Voyage.(a.) British Practice. If contraband is found on board, either the vessel herself or the offending cargo may be placed in the prize court. The doctrine of continuous voyage or ultimate destination to be applied to &quot; contraband.&quot; Shipment of contra-band goods &quot;to order &quot; to be regarded as corroborative evidence that the cargo is really destined for the enemy.(b.) United Stales Objections. The United States, having applied the doctrine of continuous voyage in their own prize courts, do not appear to have protested during the war against the principle underlying the doctrine, but rather against the character and sufficiency of the evidence adduced to prove the ultimate destination of contraband goods.(c.) Possibilities of Agreement. The United States Government are likely to agree, or would find it difficult to disagree, that (except possibly in the case of an island) a refusal to apply the doctrine of continuous voyage would, in modern conditions, divest a belligerent of all power to intercept contraband of war.3. Lists of Contraband.(a.) Existing British Practice. The distinction between absolute and conditional contraband, though difficult to define in practice, to be retained. The 1917 list (with certain additions proposed by the Advisory Committee on Trading and Blockade) to be adopted as the foundation for any future list. It will require modification in detail according to the country against which a war is being waged.(b.) United States Objections. There were occasional representations against the rapid extension of the contraband list during the war, and, in particular, every effort was made to prevent the inclusion of cotton in the list.(c.) Possibilities of Agreement. The United States themselves had a long list of contraband during the civil war. To quote Mr. Bryan, speaking as Secretary of State in 1915 :-&quot; The record of the United States in the past is not free from criticism. &quot;When neutral, this Government has stood for a restricted list of absolute and conditional contraband. As a belligerent, we have contended for a liberal list, according to our conception of the necessities of the case.&quot;It is probable, therefore, that in peace time, and when contemplating their position as a potential belligerent, the United States would agree to a much longer &quot; basic &quot; list of contraband than they appeared to think reasonable during the late war. A further element tending automatically to increase the size of the absolute contraband list is the modern practice of Governments taking over in war time the complete control of certain commodities, thus disposing of any possibility of distinguishing between absolute and conditional contraband in respect of those commodities. The United States would probably agree that commodities so controlled must automatically be declared absolute contraband.It may not be possible to agree with the United States Government on a reasonably adequate and flexible list of contraband to form the foundation of any list to be issued on the declaration of a war and to be subject to mutual revision from time to time.Blockade.4. Rules of Blockade.(a.) British Practice. According to the Declaration of Paris, &quot;blockades, in order to be binding, must be effective, that is to say, maintained by a force sufficient really to prevent access to the coast of the enemy.&quot;Continental jurists have maintained that access to the coast must be barred by a chain of warships anchored so near to one another that the line could not be passed without obvious danger. Such a blockade is clearly impossible in these days of submarine-infested seas. The Anglo-American practice has been that, if the blockade is maintained by a force sufficient to render ingress or egress hazardous,
and the capture of blockade-runners most probable, the number or station of the ships is immaterial. But even a blockade on these lines will be increasingly difficult to maintain as time goes on, and it seems not unlikely that the blockade of the future will be a long-distance affair and be applicable to the blockaded country as a whole. The doctrine of continuous voyage would be applied to the commerce of neutral countries bordering the blockaded State, the effect of the whole operation being similar to that achieved under our &quot; reprisals &quot; measures of 1915. Whether any prize court would uphold such measures, if taken in enforcing a formally declared blockade, is another matter. Whether, moreover, such an extension of &quot; blockade &quot; would not be detrimental to the interests of an island Power no longer safely predominant at sea, is a question which the Admiralty will no doubt be prepared to face. But for the purposes of this memorandum it will be assumed that in a future war we might wish to impose something in the nature of a &quot; long distance &quot; blockade.(b.) United States Objections. As no formal blockade of the German coast was declared during the last Avar, the American protests under this head are not strictly relevant. The measures taken under the Reprisals Order-in-Council of the 11th March. 1915, were justified by the British Prize Court on the ground of retaliation, not of blockade. Nevertheless, the probable attitude of the United States to any future &quot;long-distance&quot; blockade may to some extent be discerned from the nature of their protests during the war, which are summarised in the Library memorandum of the 2nd November, 1925, as follows: 1. The blockade was ineffective.2. It did not apply impartially to the ships of all nations. 3. It included neutral ports.4. The measures were retaliatory and therefore illegal.(c.) Possibilities of Agreement. If the measures taken in virtue of the Order-in-Council of March 1915 had been the result of a formal declaration of blockade, then objection 1 above (that the blockade was ineffective) might conceivably have had some force. It should not, however, be impossible to agree with the United States Government, after a dispassionate examination of all the circumstances, what are the measures of interception which may be expected to satisfy a prize court that a blockade is &quot;effective,&quot; regard being had to the present changed conditions of naval warfare. We should, however, have to be careful to do nothing in this respect which might give a third Power a reasonable pretext for declaring our measures to be a breach of the relevant provision of the Declaration of Paris, thus justifying the jettisoning of that Declaration by a potential enemy. Objection 2 (that the blockade did not apply impartially to the ships of all nations) was based on the fact that we did not touch trade across the Baltic. In any future long-distance blockade it will be difficult to ensure that there is not some arm of the sea unpatrolled, but agreement on this will depend on what is and what is not to be regarded as an effective blockade in future. Objection 3 (that the blockade included neutral ports) falls to the ground if it is admitted that the doctrine of continuous voyage is to be applicable to a blockade and the United States cannot consistently resist the applicability of this doctrine to blockade in view of their own practice during the civil war. Moreover, in modern times it is difficult to imagine any blockade which could produce useful results without the application of the doctrine. Objection 4 (that the measures taken were retaliatory) is examined under the heading &apos;&apos; Reprisals &quot; below.5. Jurisdiction of Prize Courts.(a.) British Practice. All breaches of the law of contraband and blockade to be brought before the prize court, which will try the case in accordance with the accepted canons of international law, uninfluenced by anj&apos; domestic enactments which may be held to be contrary to those canons.(b.) United States Objections. (1.) The United States Government claimed at one time that, as the British prize courts were fettered by municipal enactments binding upon them, they were not competent to deal with the complaints of neutral individuals who questioned the validity of those enactments under international law.(2.) The United States Government contended that, when a ship had been illegally brought within the jurisdiction of a belligerent Power, it could not be compelled to submit to the domestic laws and regulations of that nation.
(c.) Possibilities of Agreement. Objection 1 above is simply a misstatement of fact, since the British Prize Courts administer international and not domestic law. They have always asserted their freedom from executive control and their complete independence as a judicial body. Moreover, the whole purpose of the proposed agreement would be to decide what is the accepted international practice on these points and to bring it into harmony with modern conditions.Objection 2 is also unlikely to be raised in view of the purpose of the proposed agreement as stated above. Moreover, such a principle, if urged now by the United States, might have an embarrassing repercussion on American efforts to suppress liquor smuggling from the sea. Many arrests which might be characterised by foreign Powers as &quot;illegal&quot; have nevertheless led to the ship and crew being compelled to submit to the domestic laws and regulations of the United States.This question of the jurisdiction of the prize courts is unlikely to present much difficulty in practice (except possibly in respect of postal correspondence).6. Seizure and Censorship of Mails.(a.) British Practice. Under the XIth Hague Convention (1907) the postal correspondence of neutrals or belligerents found on the high seas, whether on board a neutral or an enemy ship, was declared to be inviolable except when proceeding to or from a blockaded port.The United States Government agreed during the war that the convention applied only to correspondence and not to parcel post, securities or negotiable instruments. It cannot in any case be held to apply to ships voluntarily entering a belligerent port. During the war the mails were removed from all neutral ships touching at or compulsorily diverted to British ports and censored in this country. Intelligence invaluable to the prize court and to the naval, military and political authorities was thus obtained, while contraband articles were found in large quantities in postal packets. The Hague Convention was held not to be applicable, because all the belligerents were not a party to it, and because its stipulations were flagrantly violated every time any German submarine sank a belligerent or neutral ship.Our practice in a &quot;future war would presumably be the same as in the late war unless all the belligerents are a party to and duly respect the relevant provisions of the XIth Hague Convention. In any event, there are cogent arguments in favour of the view that the censorship of mails should be regarded as part of the exercise of the right of visit and search of a vessel in time of war. If this view7 prevails, possibly Hague Convention No. XI may have to be denounced. All seditious matter to be submitted to prize court proceedings.(b.) United States Objections. During the war the United States did not admit that there was any right in international law7 to censor neutral postal correspondence wrhether the mail bags had been removed from neutral vessels compulsorily diverted to British waters or from those voluntarily touching at a British port. They further contended that correspondence, including shipping documents, money order lists, &amp;c, even though relating to enemy supplies or exports, were, unless carried in the same ship as the relevant property, entitled to unmolested passage.(c.) Possibilities of Agreement. It is doubtful whether we should ever secure any agreement with the United States which does not recognise the full application of the XIth Hague Convention so far as concerns the inviolability of postal correspondence, In the light of our war experience and the invaluable aid received from the censorship of neutral mail it is unfortunate, perhaps, that we should ever have signed the convention. But the convention is there, and, unless it is denounced, we shall in any future war presumably abide by its provisions so long as these are observed by the enemy (even though not technically party to the convention). If the convention is to be retained and observed, there should not be much difficulty in reaching an agreement with the United States Government in this matter. If not, I should not despair of the possibility of our being able to persuade the United States Government of the importance for both countries of keeping their hands free to search the mails, wherever found, for seditious matter a course which would probably be upheld by the prize court if the convention -were to be denounced.As regards the removal and censorship of other types of mail from vessels forcibly diverted to a belligerent port, w7e are not likely to have any serious difficulty with the United States, provided that they can be brought to recognise the necessity
in modern times of diversion for purposes of search. Neither, as shown in section 5 above, shall we necessarily have difficulty over the question of &quot; jurisdiction,&quot; Which figured so prominently in the war controversies over the mail question.It may here be remarked that, after the United States entered the war, she imposed a most stringent censorship on all types of correspondence found on neutral vessels voluntarily calling at United States ports. We have, however, no record of the American censorship having examined mails taken from a ship, either boarded on the high seas or compulsorily diverted, because the United States were not co-operating in the interception or diversion of neutral traffic.7. &quot; Rationing &quot; of a Neutral bordering upon a Belligerent State.(a.) British Practice. This system, for which there is no precedent in inter-national law, was applied most efficaciously as a result of the conclusion of a series of agreements with associations of importers, such as the N.O.T. in Holland, and the S.S.S. in Switzerland. The seizure of a commodity on the ground that ah altogether excessive quantity had already been imported by the particular neutral country of destination which happens to border upon an enemy State was upheld during the war by the British Prize Court, to the extent of dismissing a claim for damages. While&quot; I understand that we cannot rely on this decision in justifying stoppage merely on the ground of excess, it may be assumed that we shall use such means as are at our disposal to introduce a similar system of li rationing,&quot; where applicable, in any future war.(b.) United States Objections. The United States Government protested during the war against interference with goods intended to become incorporated in the &quot;common stock of a neutral country. However, they appear to have raised no serious objection on this score, once the &quot; navicert&quot; scheme (see below) and the agreements with importing associations in European countries were in operation. After their entry into the war, the United States co-operated cordially in the application of the &quot; rationing &apos;&apos; machinery, though they were careful not to approve the actual seizure of a neutral cargo in order to render the policy effective.(c.) Possibilities of Agreement. Possibly the United States Government may now take the line that &quot; rationing &quot; is permissible and reasonable, provided it is done by agreement with the neutral States concerned (including the exporting State). But this does not get over the difficulty that there must be a preliminary period of &quot; rationing pressure &quot; in order to induce importing neutrals to make the necessary rationing agreements. Perhaps, by means of some device similar to the &quot; navicert &quot; scheme, the United States may be induced to assume a benevolent attitude, but this is undoubtedly one of the points on which it will be difficult to find any basis of agreement with the Americans.8. Navicert Scheme.In March 1916 it was arranged, with the tacit assent of the United States Government, that *&apos; letters of assurance &quot; should be issued by His Majesty&apos;s Embassy at Washington to applicant firms in the United States in respect of goods the passage of which through the naval patrols His Majesty&apos;s Government were prepared to facilitate. The system, of which very free use was made, was worked by telegraphic consultation between the Embassy and London, although the Embassy had authority to grant letters without consultation in cases where similar exports from the United Kingdom would not require licences. Details of the scheme are given in the annexed print.The scheme soon became so popular with shipping companies that many refused to carry any goods not covered by a &quot;navicert &quot; letter, and vessels carrying only cargo thus guaranteed were relieved from practically all disabilities resulting from the &quot;blockade.&quot; The friction with the United States was greatly reduced through the introduction of this system.In any agreement with the United States it should be possible to arrange for the setting up, immediately on the outbreak of war, of some such organisation in the country remaining neutral. The arrangements would, of course, be relatively easy and expeditious so long as no formal blockade is declared, and it is merely a question of dealing with a restricted list of contraband. No conceivable breach of sovereignty is involved, since the employment of the facilities offered would be Entirely optional
for the exporting firm. But even in the early days of a war most reputable firms either in this country or in the United States would probably be glad to make use of the facilities thus made available with the consent of their own Government. The absence of knowledge in the early stages of a war in regard to enemy agents, &amp;c, in neutral countries need not prevent the immediate inception of the scheme; its effectiveness for purposes of stopping contraband, small in the initial stages, would increase as experience of enemy methods was obtained. If such an arrangement were to come automatically into operation on the outbreak of a war in which either Great Britain or the United States were involved, the maintenance of smooth relations between the two countries would be enormously facilitated.9. Black List, Statutory List, Bunker Coal, Insurance, Banking Facilities.After United States action as a belligerent in the war, no difficulty is antici-pated in corning to a reasonable understanding with the United States on the above points.10. Rejfrisals.The United States held that the measures taken under the Order in Council of March 1915 were retaliatory, and therefore illegal. On the other hand, the British Prize Courts upheld the validity of measures which had been taken as a reprisal for a previous breach of international law.It is clearly in the general interest that retaliatory measures not specifically sanctioned by international law should not be undertaken either lightly or on the first pretext. It is equally clear that, in the event of a consistent violation of the recognised precepts of international law by one belligerent, the other must, in self-defence, and to avoid extermination, adopt either the same or some other measure of reprisal. Moreover, some sanction must be applied to a State avowedly and consistently violating international law. In the absence of combined action by the neutral Powers, the only possible sanction is retaliation by the opponent. Action by the League of Nations could not be invoked in an agreement with the United States.A clause providing for &quot;reprisals,&quot; particularly for any breach of the Declaration of Paris -of of the principles underlying the unratined Washington Convention respecting submarine warfare, would clearly be an essential part of any agreement with the United States such as is proposed in this memorandum. Its acceptance by the United States Government, within specified and reasonable limitations, is not beyond the bounds of possibility. It would, of course, be provided that any such measures of reprisal would only be taken with the utmost regard for the commerce of the country remaining neutral and free discussion to this end would be invited.11. Article 16 of the Covenant of the League of Nations.Under this article member States undertake, inter alia, to subject a Covenant-breaking State to the &quot;prevention of all financial, commercial or personal inter-course between the nationals of the Covenant-breaking State and the nationals of any other State, whether a member of the League or not.&quot;This article was drafted at a time when it was thought that, the League being practically all embracing, there would be no neutrals worth considering. As things stand, however, we have to deal -with a very powerful neutral and it would be a gross breach of international law to interfere on the high seas with that neutrals commerce without a previous declaration of war on the Covenant-breaking State. If the proposed agreement with the United States dealt with measures to be taken after a declaration of war and if war were to be declared by us on a Covenant-breaking State, the provisions of the agreement would, so far as we are concerned, automatically apply to action taken under article 16. A &quot;blockade&quot; of the Covenant-breaking State would be declared and full effect would thus be given to the provisions of article 16. If, however, war were not declared by the coercing Powers, our agreement with the United States would not apply and we should be in the same situation as if it did not exist. In either event the conclusion of such an agreement could hardly be held to conflict with our obligations under article 16.On the contrary, if, in pursuance of article 16, this country were to declare a blockade against the coast of a Covenant-breaking State or to take other steps to stop its trade on the high seas, it would be of the utmost value that we should at that time
have an agreement with the United States defining the limits within which such action could be taken without bringing in the United States on the side of the Covenant-breaker.VI. General Conclusions from above Analysis.The above examination of our probable future procedure, based largely on the practices emerging from the war, does not purport to be exhaustive, but it is, I think, sufficient to demonstrate that the probable divergencies of view between ourselves and the United States are not necessarily insurmountable, even if the British practice be estimated on the basis of the maximum of severity permissible under international law. Any relaxation of our traditional attitude, due to changing conditions, would, of course, make agreement with the, United States correspondingly simpler.Everything would really depend on whether the United States Government would be prepared to talk at all on this subject. Although there is nothing to prove it at present, they may be found to be definitely wedded to their conception of &quot; freedom of the seas,&quot; i.e., abolition of all blockade or contraband measures in time of war. Again, they may consider the whole question too &quot;entangling,&quot; though it is hardly more so than the disarmament discussions on which they enter freely. A further possible, though on the whole unlikely attitude is that the United States Government would prefer to keep this question open because they know that, in any future war in which we are a belligerent, the United States, as a neutral, would have the &quot; whip-hand &quot; so far as the exertion of naval pressure is concerned.But, provided that the United States Government are prepared to discuss the subject at all. they may well be found to be amenable to a proposed arrangement which could be pointed to as mitigating the effects of the Geneva failure, and as even, in the long run facilitating the conclusion of an agreement for the limitation of cruiser construction. For this reason and because we should have to wait a good two years before we could begin discussions with the Government which will come into power in March 1929, it would, if possible, be preferable not to defer any discussions on this subject until after the American elections (as had been suggested in my earlier memorandum). The most favourable time for sounding the Americans would be some time between now and the spring. After that the electoral campaign will begin in earnest. The party &quot; conventions &quot; will be held in the summer, and thereafter negotiations with the United States Government on any subject will be difficult.Should it be decided that such a discussion with the United States Government is feasible and desirable from our point of view, it would have to be undertaken, in the first instance, with the utmost caution. With the example of the Geneva Conference before us. it seems desirable that the preliminary soundings should be of an entirely informal and unofficial character, responsibility for which could, if necessary, be repudiated by His Majesty&apos;s Government, should the soil be found to be unsuitable or the season unpropitious. In this way we should not have prejudiced our position in any way if the present United States Government are found to be unfavourably disposed; we should not have shown our hand, and nothing would have occurred to prevent the repetition of the experiment at some later date. In this connection it is important that any preliminary enquiry here as to the desirability and possibility of an agreement on these questions should be regarded as secret.VII. Objections likely to be urged against proposed Agreement.I foresee two objections which may well be urged against this scheme even if it Avere held to be otherwise feasible.The first is the objection of the naval authorities, and in a lesser degree of the legal authorities, to any further attempt at the codification of the law and procedure of prize. The report of the International LaAv Committee, dated December 1918, on the historical and legal side of the question of the &quot; Freedom of the Seas,&quot; recommends that, as the strongest naval PoAver, this country should resolutely oppose any further attempt at codification as being both futile and prejudicial to our interests as a potential belligerent.The arguments in favour of keeping our hands free are, of course, very Aveighty; but they require revision, if only because, during the nine years which have elapsed since that report was written, the situation has been profoundly modified by the admission to a virtual equality of naval strength of the Power Avhich, in the past,
has shown the greatest energy and determination in the defence of neutral rights. Moreover, to leave these problems of prize law in a fluid and indeterminate state is like leaving dynamite lying about loose in a ship which may at any moment encounter a terrific storm. So far as Anglo-American relations are concerned, it is tantamount to keeping in being the one question which might conceivably lead to an eventual explosion. By insisting on keeping our hands free now, the Admiralty would run the risk of seeing our activities unnecessarily circumscribed later by a United States determined to &quot; go the limit &quot; in protecting neutral rights.The other objection likely to be encountered is that this is a matter which properly comes within the sphere of the League of Nations and should not form the subject of separate negotiation between the two principal naval Powers. But to achieve an agreement on this subject with the League Powers would be a Herculean task of many years&apos; duration which might leave this country shackled as no Anglo-American agreement need leave it. Moreover, at the end it would not necessarily bring us nearer to an agreement with the United States.There are three other very cogent reasons for beginning with the United States: (1.) She is the Power which, as a neutral, could most seriously threaten to interfere with our naval measures as a belligerent.(2.) She is one of the few Powers which need be considered in time of war solely as an exporter of neutral goods, for she is only co-terminous with Canada and Mexico, and we would in any case never undertake a blockade of Mexico without previous agreement with the United States. Most other countries are potential importers of neutral goods, that is, they adjoin other States with which we might conceivably have to go to war.The negotiation with a group of these potentially importing neutral States of an agreement in regard to the limits of naval economic pressure must necessarily be a more difficult task than the negotiation of such an agreement with a potentially exporting neutral State, i.e., a State not co-terminous with any country with which we are likely to be at war.(3.) France has steadily refused to sign the Washington Treaty abolishing the use of the submarine for blockade purposes. She must therefore be assumed to favour this form of warfare. No agreement on this subject appears to me possible which does not proceed on the assumption that the terms of the treaty are to be observed and which does not reserve the right to take reprisals in the event of their non-observance by any belligerent. No such reservation seems possible in any agreement which might be negotiated within the League of Nations so long as France maintains her present attitude.Once an agreement had been reached with the United States, the task of negotiating with other countries, if still held to be desirable, would be immensely facilitated!VIII. A ction Suggested. To sum up, the following action is suggested: (a.) The Committee of imperial Defence might conduct an enquiry into this question at the earliest possible moment, particularly as regards the points mentioned under Section headed &quot; Possible necessity for modifica-tion of traditional British practice &quot; (p. 3). If we are to approach the present United States Government, this should be done within the next two or three months, i.e., before the electoral campaign is in full swing.(6.) As soon as agreement is reached here as to wdiat we can, and what We probably will&apos; want to do in any future war, an early opportunity might be taken to sound the United States Government, discreetly and informally, as to whether they are prepared to discuss these questions; if their disposition is found to be favourable it could then be ascertained whether their views are within a measurable distance of ours.(c.) Should the preliminary soundings produce favourable results, the question of opening formal negotiations might be considered after consultation with the Dominions.R. L. CRAIGIEPdreign Office, October 17, 1927.
Annex to Memorandum.Arrangement for the Issue of Letters of Assurance in the Case of Particular Consignments for Scandinavian Destinations.It has been arranged that firms in the United States desiring to ascertain whether shipments to Scandinavia would be regarded by His Majesty s Government as of a purely neutral character in the light of existing information as to enemy dealings may apply to Sir Richard Crawford at the Trade Department of the British Embassy at Washington, who will issue &quot; letters of assurance &quot; in the case of goods the passage of which through the naval patrols His Majesty&apos;s Government are pre-pared to facilitate as far as possible unless subsequent evidence of enemy destination is brought to their notice.Goods will be dealt with under this scheme in the. following two categories: 1. Goods the export of which is prohibited or restricted in the United Kingdom. 2. Goods on the &quot; free list.&quot;The British Embassy at Washington are kept informed of the names of firms on the Black Lists for Norway. Sweden, and Denmark. In all cases, therefore, where similar exports from the United Kingdom would not require licences, the British authorities in the United States of America are able to give information without reference to London; their information will be. based on the fact that the consignees do, or do not, appear on the list, subject to any special directions that may be sent to the Embassy. Thus the exporter in the United States of America is placed on precisely the same footing as the exporter from the United Kingdom.In the case of goods on the British prohibited or restricted lists of exports, the following procedure is adopted : Applications forwarded to London by His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador are numbered consecutively, and the same number is given to any &quot; letter of assurance &quot; eventually granted. Arrangements have been made so that the number allotted to this shipment should appear on the manifest of the vessel carrying it. In this way each consignment covered by an Embassy letter is readily identified by the Contraband Committee. The Ambassadors telegrams referring to these applications are identified by the code word &quot; navicert,&quot; and are numbered consecutively, continuing as follows : Letter denoting country of destination.Serial number.Name of consignor.Description and weight of goods.Name of consignee, and place of destination.In these telegrams &quot; A &quot; represents Norway, &apos;&apos; B &quot; Sweden, and &quot; C &quot; Denmark. The letter &quot; T &quot; is used in the case of goods regarding which the Embassy have been satisfied that they are in transit for a Russian destination. Thus, the form of a message from Sir C. Spring-Rice would run : &quot; Navicert A. 127 Armour Company 10 tons fat backs Hans Heen.&quot;The Contraband Committee, send a reply to each particular item of the Embassy telegram of enquiry within forty-eight hours of its receipt in one of the three following forms: 1. &quot; Accipe,&quot; in which case the applicant will be informed that, &quot; as far as is at present known, there would appear to be no objection on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Government to this shipment.&quot;2. &quot;Nolo,&quot; which means &quot;that this shipment is likely to lead to difficulties if persisted in.&quot;3. &quot; Pendens,&quot; which means that &quot;enquiries are being made, and that a decision will be sent as soon as possible.&quot;On the arrival of the vessel, each shipment covered by an Embassy letter ol assurance is identified by the Avord &quot;navicert,&quot; followed by the letter denoting the country of destination and the serial number, thus, &quot;Navicert A. 127.&quot; There is also a series of numbers for goods not on the British prohibited or restricted lists, which will be identified on the manifest by the. distinguishing letter &quot;Z&quot;; thus,
&quot; Navicert Z. 1.&quot; Similarly, in the case of goods in transit for Russia, the item on the manifest will be numbered in a series, thus, &quot; Navicert T. 1.&quot; The Embassy at Washington will issue letters of assurance in cases where they are satisfied of Russian destination without reference to London, provided the goods are consigned to the &quot; Transito A/B,&quot; and provided that the necessary certificate has been issued by His Majesty&apos;s consul at Helsingfors.In cases where guarantees as to neutral destination are required by the Contraband Committee, they will have to be submitted to His Majesty s Government in the case of each country, in accordance with the following procedure : (a.) In the case of cotton for Norway, the certificate issued by the Norwegian Cotton Mills Association will be communicated to the Foreign Office through His Majesty*s Legation at Christiania.(b.) The recognised forms of guarantee for Norway are. obtained through the shipping lines, with whom His Majesty&apos;s Government have agreements, and are filed at His Majesty&apos;s Legation at Christiania.(c.) The guarantees which Swedish consignees may desire to give in the case of shipments from the United States of America are submitted to the Foreign Office as occasion arises.(d.) The Danish Associations will submit to His Majesty&apos;s Legation at Copenhagen all guarantees given by them in respect of goods consigned to Denmark from the United States of America, and they will notify the Foreign Office through their London representatives. In the case of Denmark, therefore, the issue of letters of assurance by His Majesty;s Embassy at Washington will mean that no difficulties will arise in con-nection with the shipment in question, subject to the production of the usual guarantees under the agreement with the Danish Associations by the consignees before the delivery of the goods, and subject also to the usual proviso covering unforeseen circumstances. In each case of instruc-tions being sent to Sir C. Spring-Rice to refuse the Embassy letter, the Danish Associations concerned will be notified by the Foreign Office.It has for the present been decided not to include copper, petroleum and its products, or lubricants among the substances for wdiich the Trade Department of the British Embassy at Washington will issue letters; these commodities can, for the present, be more conveniently dealt with by means of the wrorking arrangements of His Majesty&apos;s Government with the shipping lines. All other commodities exported from the United States to Scandinavian countries are dealt with under this scheme, with the exception of those which cannot be exported to Scandinavia from the United States under the agreements with exporters in the United States.The application of a firm in the United States to the Trade Department of the British Embassy is, of course, entirely voluntary; but His Majesty&apos;s Government have reason to believe that the United States Government wall place no obstacles in the way of firms in the United States desiring to avail themselves of these facilities. It is hoped that a large number of firms wall make applications, and that eventually the shipping companies will find it more convenient, in order to avoid detention and delays, to accept such consignments only as are covered by the British Embassy letter of assurance. In this way the exporting firm and shipping company will find them-selves exposed to the minimum of delay and inconvenience in the case of shipments which His Majesty&apos;s Government can regard as satisfactory; the work of the, naval patrol will be made easier; and firms in the United States will be discouraged from making doubtful shipments to Scandinavia. It is, moreover, hoped that by means of simultaneously withholding letters of assurance in the. United States and export licences in this country a system of approximate rationing of each of the Scandinavian countries could be established whenever one of these countries has received the amount of a particular commodity corresponding to its normal requirements or stipulated for in any agreement with His Majesty&apos;s Government.An announcement has been made in the press in the United States by Sir C. Spring-Rice; no public announcement has, however, been made, elsewhere beyond the necessary communications of the steamship companies and to applicants for information in regard to particular consignments; in these cases the annexed* printed memorandum is sent.Foreign Office, April 7, 1916.* Nob printed.
