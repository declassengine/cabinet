iThi-s Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.&quot;^ 2 Printed for the Cabinet.  October 1927.CONFIDENTIAL.30CP. 255 (27).THE ANGLO-PORTUGUESE ALLIANCE.THE continued refusal of the Portuguese Government to give any redress in a series of cases in which British citizens have suffered grave injury in person or in property and the long drawn-out dispute between the Government of the Union of South Africa and the Portuguese authorities in regard to the railway and port administration at Lourenco Marques, which recently culminated in a singularly offensive letter from the Portuguese Minister of the Colonies to General Hertzog, led me to ask myself whether the time had not come to reconsider our treaty obligations to Portugal. I accordingly addressed an enquiry to Sir W. Tyrrell and requested him to have the whole subject examined in the Foreign Office.I now circulate for the consideration of the Cabinet the terms of my enquiry and the very able memorandum in which Mr. Villiers has replied to it.A COctober 24, 1927.Sir Aiisten Chamberlain to Sir W. Tyrrell, Geneva, September 18, 1927.The Portuguese Government claim our support on all manner of occasions on the ground of our alliance, e.g., for their candidature for the Council, and, at the other end of the world, for the defence of Macao, or again in India for the main-tenance of the authority in British India of the Portuguese Patriarchate. I can see what we stand to lose by the Treaty of &quot;Windsor; I am not clear what we gain. Please let this question be examined and a report submitted to me on my return.Memorandum by the Foreign Office, October 1927.The advantages which we derive from the Portuguese Alliance may be stated under three heads : 1. Portuguese assistance in time of war.The amount of reliance which can be placed on the Portuguese army and navy, and the efficacy of their armed assistance, are very little. In fact, thePortuguese troops in the late Avar were a positive danger and had to be sent home. Nevertheless, in both the wars which we have waged during the present century the Portuguese Alliance has been of real value to us. It was in virtue of the alliance that the Portuguese Government in 1899 agreed, in the Anglo-Portuguese Secret Declaration, that they would not allow arms ar^d ammunition to be imported through their African Colonies into the Transvaal, and that they would not proclaim neutrality in the Boer war. In the Great &quot;War the Portuguese Government, besides handing over 20,000 otherwise unobtainable rifles and ammunition to the South African Govern-ment, and allowing us to have some of their artillery, seized the German ships at Lisbon and, most unwillingly, handed them over to us. At a time when ships were priceless these vessels were of incalculable use to us. Certainly neither of these contingencies were foreseen when the alliance was concluded. It is at least possible that similar unforeseen contingencies may arise in the future. Presumably, too, the knowledge that Portugal cannot be reckoned among potential enemies is of assistance to our naval and military authorities in drawing up schemes both for defence and attack.4164   [16721] b
2. The grant to us and the denial to our enemies in time of war of the use of the Tagus and the Portuguese Atlantic islands as bases for warships, submarines and aircraft,- and the undertaking of the Portuguese Govem-ment not to grant to foreigners concessions for coaling stations or cable landing rights in the Atlantic islands without consulting us -previously.The removal of the German menace has greatly lessened the immediate strategic value of the alliance in the above respect. If in 1914 the Portuguese had been in alliance with the Germans, or had been neutral in the sense that the Swedes were neutral, our situation would have been rendered immeasurably more dangerous and difficult. It might, indeed, have nearly lost us the war. In the course of time another country may take the place held by Germany during the first two decades of this century, and the value of the islands as a base for aircraft and submarines operating against the ships on which Ave depend in time of war for our daily bread may be as great in the future as it was in 1914. Denunciation of the alliance with the possible result of throwing Portugal into the arms of a potential enemy would be a very serious step.In a memorandum, dated December 1912, the Admiralty held that &quot; If ever the alliance is terminated by action on either side, we should make it a cardinal point of our subsequent policy to see that no maritime State, such as France or Germany, replaces us, and thus obtains the right to use the Cape de Verdes, the Azores, or Portuguese Guinea, either as a sovereign Power or as an ally of Portugal. We should prevent at all costs the transfer of these par-ticular possessions to any strong naval Power.&quot;The Foreign Office views on the Admiralty memorandum were as follows : &quot; The Admiralty consider that Ave may safely give up the alliance provided Portugal remains independent and her Atlantic islands are not acquired by a maritime PoAA^er.&apos;&apos; But by AAhat means other than the alliance is it suggested that this con-dition can be fulfilled ? At the present moment there can be no question but that the alliancewand the alliance alone, stands in the Avay of the islands falling into other hands. It is the easiest thing in the Avorld for Germany or France to pick a quarrel with Portugal that Avould lead to aa^ar, and then to attack and keepthe islands.....By deliberately giving up the alliance Ave should have lost the only locus standi enabling us to interpose and preArent such a consummation. There seems no other means of obtaining such a locus standi. We should be reduced to making a peremptory demand on Germany, Avithout any legal justifi-cation of any kind, to keep her hands off territory from Avhich Ave had openly withdraAvn our protecting hand. This aa7ould be a most invidious policj&apos; to pursue, and one not likely to command popular support at the critical moment in this country.&quot; Even if Ave could secure, a right of pre-emption over the islands a most unlikely thing for any Portuguese GoA&apos;ernment to concede to us if Ave insist on repudiating the alliance such pre-emptive rights Avould not legally stand against a conquest by a third Power.&quot;Under the existing arrangements, the alliance prevents any third PoAver from acquiring the Portuguese islands except by going to Avar AAdth England and defeating her. Moreover, ah appeal to the alliance has enabled us on several occasions to defeat German schemes of disguised designs in the Avay of coaling stations, wireless installations, and other similar enterprises in the islands, notably Madeira and Teneriffe.&apos;&apos; The conclusion appears to be that the conditions which the Admiralty consider essential to any arrangement for terminating the alliance could not be fulfilled except by maintaining it.&quot;In spite of the elimination for the time being of the German menace, the above contention remains sound.The Portuguese, undertaking not to allow foreigners to obtain a foothold in the islands in time of peace is not Avithout value, but this value is lessened Avhen, as happened Avithin the last three months, the Portuguese Government &quot;forget &quot; their obligation. They have granted cable landing rights in the Azores to the Italian Italca Company.  We are making a formal protest.
3. A certain measure of control over Portuguese foreign -policy in its widest aspects and the support of the Portuguese Government in various cases where their interests are not concerned.The Portuguese cling desperately to the British Alliance. It is almost their sole claim to respectability and consideration. For this reason they are most unlikely to take any radical step or enter into serious political commitments without our consent.Only a few months ago they consulted us before listening to Spanish advances. In the event, say, of Signor Mussolini endeavouring to form an anti-British Italo-Spanish entente or agreement, Portugal would certainly not join. In international conferences where no Portuguese interests are at stake we can generally rely on Portuguese support. In the same order of things, the Portuguese representative on the Committee of Control at Tangier invariably votes with his British colleague. The King of Spain once called Portugal a British satellite. This, of course, is an exaggeration, but it contains a measure of truth.Whereas we have held for many years and have informed the Portuguese Government that we consider ourselves entitled to judge the circumstances in which help may be given to or withheld from the Portuguese, the latter showed by their attitude on the outbreak of war that they consider themselves bound by the alliance. There is no reason to suppose that the Portuguese Government hold other views now, and the natural inference is that they will not of their own accord consent to release us from the obligations of the treaties. The question at once arises whether we can release ourselves without their consent. The answer appears to be in the negative.Not one of the treaties contains any provisions or machinery for termination or denunciation. Indeed, the treaty of 1373 speaks of :&apos; perpetual Friendships, Unions, Alliances, and Leagues&quot;; the treaty of 1386 lays down that &quot;there shall be inviolate and endure for ever .... a solid, perpetual and real League &quot; ; the treaty of 1642 concludes, &apos;: for ever a good, true and firm peace and amity &quot;; and so on. In mediaeval days and later a Perpetual Treaty of Alliance could alwa3rs be terminated by a declaration of war. No such solution is possible in the present instance.Oppenheim&apos;s standard work on &quot; International Law &quot; states as follows : &quot; Although .... such treaties as are apparently intended or expressly contracted for the purpose of setting up an everlasting condition of things cannot in principle be dissolved by withdrawal of one of the parties, there is an exception to this rule. For it is an almost universally recognised fact that vital changes of circumstances may be of such a kind as to justify a party in demanding to be released from the obligations of an unnotifiable treatjr. The vast majority of publicists, as well as the Governments of the civilised States, defend the principle conventio omnis intelligitur rebus sic stantibus, and they agree, therefore, that all treaties are concluded under the tacit condition rebus sic stantibus. That this condition involves a large amount of danger cannot be denied, for it can be, and, indeed, frequently has been, abused for the purpose of hiding the violation of treaties behind the shield of law, and of covering shameful wrong with the mantle of righteousness. But all this cannot alter the fact that this exceptional condition is as necessary for international law and international intercourse as the very rule pacta sunt servanda. When the existence, or the vital development of a State stands in unavoidable conflict with its treaty obligations, the latter must give way, for self-preservation and development, in accordance with the growth and the vital requirements of the nation, are the primary duties of every State. No State would consent to any such treaty as would hinder it in the fulfilment of these primary duties. The consent of a State to a treaty presupposes a conviction that it is not fraught with danger to its existence and vital development. For this reason every treaty implies a condition that, if by an unforeseen change of circumstances an obligation stipulated in the treaty should imperil the existence or vital develop-ment of one of the parties, it should have a right to demand to be released from the obligation concerned.,* *****&quot; It is generally agreed that the clause, rebus sic stantibus, may only be resorted to in very exceptional circumstances, and that certainly not every change of circumstances justifies a State in making use of it.   All agree that, [16721] b 2
although treaty obligations may, through a change of circumstances, become disagreeable, burdensome, and onerous, they must, nevertheless, be discharged. All agree, further, that a change of government, and even a change in the form of a State, such as the turning of a monarchy into a republic, and vice versa, does not alone, and in itself, justify a State in resorting to the clause. On the other hand, all agree in regard to many cases in which it could justly be made use of. Thus, for example, if a State enters into a treaty of alliance for a certain period of time, and, if, before the expiration of the alliance, a change of circumstances occurs, so that now the alliance endangers the very existence of one of the contracting parties, all will agree that the clause, rebus sic stantibus, would justify that party in demanding to be released from the treaty of alliance.&quot; A certain amount of disagreement as to the cases in which the clause might, or might not, be justly applied will, of course, always remain as long as there is no international court which could decide each case. But the fact is remarkable that since the beginning of the 19th century only very few cases of the application of the clause have occurred. And there is no doubt-that during the last century a conviction became more and more prevalent, that the clause, rebus sic stantibus, ought not to give a State the right, immediately upon the happening of a vital change of circumstances, to declare itself free from the obligations of a treaty, but should only entitle it to claim to be released from them by the other party or parties to the treaty. Accordingly, when a State is of the opinion that the obligations of a treaty have, through a vital change of circumstances, become unbearable, it should first approach the other party or parties, and request them to abrogate the treaty. If such abrogation be refused a conflict arises between the treaty obligations and the right to be released from them, which, in the absence of an international court that could give judgment in the matter, cannot be settled juridically. It is only then that a State may perhaps be justified in declaring that it can no longer consider itself bound by those obligations.&quot;Has there been any &quot; vital change of circumstances &quot; since in 1899, and again inferentially in 1904, we confirmed our obligation to &quot; defend and protect&apos;&apos; the&apos; Portuguese Colonies? Can it be said that our &quot;-existence &quot; or our &quot; vital develop-ment &quot; stand in unavoidable conflict with the obligations imposed by the treaties? Does the alliance &quot;endanger our veiy existence&quot;? The answer in every case is in the negative. The defeat of Germany in the Great War is a change of circumstances certainly, but not within Oppenheim&apos;s meaning. The Portuguese Colonies are no worse administered now than they wrere in 1899 or previously. If we told the Portuguese Government that we intended to denounce the treaties, they would presumably reply by demanding arbitration. This we could not possibly refuse, and we should lose the case.
Appendix I.Treaty Obligations of Great Britain towards Portugal, with Special Referenceto Macao.THIS question of our obligations to assist Portugal has been called to notice on more than one occasion recently in connection with the frequently recurring disputes between China and Portugal in regard to Macao. For Portugal has formed the inconvenient habit of appealing under the guarantee clauses of our old treaties with her for our intervention when such a dispute occurs. To comply with such requests for support may in certain circumstances prove embarrassing. A re-examination of our treaty obligations in this matter has therefore been made, and. as is explained in greater detail below, has led to the conclusion that though the obligation to support Portugal under the old treaties is admitted, His Majesty&apos;s Government have in the past reserved to themselves the right of consenting or declining to render assistance according to the merits of each particular case (see paragraph 5 below).2. The obligations in question are contained in certain clauses of the treaties of 1373, 13S6, 1642, 1654. 1660. 1661 and 1703, which were confirmed in 1815 and 1899 (for texts see Annex I); in addition, the preamble of the treaty concluded with Portugal on the 16th November, 1904 (Treaty of Windsor), refers to the &quot;friend-ship and alliance which have happily subsisted for so long a period between them (the two monarchs) and the two nations which they represent,&quot; and would thus appear to recognise once more the validity of the old treaties.3. A perusal of the texts of the relevant clauses (see Annex I) will show that, though certain of them refer to the special circumstances of the moment and are therefore obsolete, others are couched in the widest terms and involve a general obligation on the parties to render mutual assistance to one another in all circumstances, e.g. : 1(a.) Article 1 of treaty of 1373 : In the first place, we settle and covenant that there shall be from this day forward between our above said Lord Edward, King of England and France, and the Lord Ferdinand, King of Portugal and Algarve, and the Lady Eleanor, Queen and his consort, their successors in the aforesaid Kingdoms of England and Portugal, and their realms, lands, dominions, provinces, vassals, and subjects faithfully obeying them, whatsoever true, faithful, constant, mutual, and perpetual friendships, unions, alliances, and leagues of sincere affection, and that as true and faithful friends they shall henceforth reciprocally be friends to friends, and enemies to enemies, and shall assist, maintain, and uphold each other mutually by sea and by land against all men that may live or die, of whatever dignit3r, station, rank or condition they may be, and against their lands, realms and dominions.They shall strive for and preserve, as much as in them lies, the personal safety, security, interest and honour, and the harmlessness, conservation and restitution of their rights, property, effects and friends, wheresoever they be.They shall everywhere faithfully prevent the hurts and injuries, disgrace, or baseness which they know or which one party knows to be at any future time intended or contemplated against the other party, and shall provide remedies for them; and they shall as expeditiously as may be, by letters or messengers, or in any better way which they can contrive, without reserve, and fully inform, forewarn, and usefully counsel the other party against whom such things are meditating, relative to what has just been mentioned.(&amp;.) Article 1 of treaty of 1386 : .... so that either of them shall be bound to succour and afford aid to the other against all men that may live and die who shall attempt to violate the peace of the other, or injure its State in any way.....(c.) Article 1 of treaty of 1703 : .... so that there shall be between the said kingdoms and States, their people and subjects, a sincere friendship and perfect amity: they shall all of them mutually assist one another. . . . .
4. The confirmation of 1899 referred to in paragraph 2 ahovc, a secret declara-tion that the two Governments considered the ancient treaties of alliance, amity and guarantee to be of full force and effect, quoted and specifically confirmed article 1 of the treaty of 1642 and the following passage from the English version* of the secret article of the treaty of 1661 : &quot;Over and above all and singular agreed and concluded in the Treaty of Marriage between the Most Serene and Most Powerful Charles, the second of that name. King of Great Britain, and the Most Virtuous and Serene Lady Catherine, Infanta of Portugal, it is by this secret article con-cluded and accorded, that His Majesty of Great Britain, in regard of the great advantages and increase of dominion he hath purchased by the above-mentioned Treaty of Marriage, shall promise and oblige himself, as by this present article he doth, to defend and protect all conquests or colonies belonging to the Crown of Portugal against all his ^its) enemies, as well future as present.&apos;&apos;5. It seems therefore clear that His Majesty&apos;s Government is under a general obligation to defend Portuguese territory and colonies against all enemies of Portugal. This obligation has been explicitly acknowledged several times during the last century and on at least one occasion, viz., in 1826. when the assistance of His Majesty&apos;s Government was requested by Portugal under the treaties, an armed force was sent. It is to be remarked, however, that, in consequence presumably of the antiquity of most of the treaties in question and the very different circumstances in which they were concluded. His Majesty&apos;s Government have in the past considered themselves to have a right to scrutinise in each particular case the circumstances in which their help was invoked by Portugal under the treaties; and it is important to note that in 1873 His Majesty &quot;s Minister at Lisbon was specifically instructed to make it clear to the Government of Portugal &apos;&apos; that Her Majesty&apos;s Government reserved to themselves to judgfe of the circumstances under which any appeal was made to them by Portugal for succour.&quot; In regard to this point, the late Sir E. Hertslet wrote in, 1877 : &quot;It will therefore be seen that although the old treaties of alliance and guarantee are admitted to be still in force, yet that Her Majesty&apos;s Government have never considered that they are bound under all circumstances to defend Portugal &apos; as England itself &apos;; but on the contrary, that they have reserved to themselves the right of judging of the circumstances in which help may be given or withheld.; or, in other words, that whilst the old treaties give this country a right to interfere in any case of external attack against Portugal, they do not compel it to do so.&quot;      ^6. Further on in the same memorandum he wrote with special reference to the binding clause of the secret article of the treaty of 1661 quoted in paragraph 4 above : &quot; This clause is certainly couched in precise and apparently very binding terms; but after what has passed of late years with regard to the Portuguese proceedings on the east and west coasts of Africa and in the interior, can it be said that this country has felt itself bound to protect the so-called Portuguese &apos; conquests &apos; in those parts of the world ? On the contrary, the British Government oppose these claims on the part of Portugal, and deny her right to maivy places which she asserts belong to her by conquest. If then these old treaties are inoperative in Africa, it may be asked ought they now to be considered as still binding in all circumstances in Asia, as the term &apos; conquest and colonies &apos; applies to all parts of the globe &quot; ; and again in the same memorandum Sir E. Hertslet wrote that &quot;each question&quot; of appeal by Portugal for assistance under the treaties &quot;must be decided on its own merits as it arises.&quot;7. In 1913, Sir E. Grey wrote with reference to this question : The conclusion therefore seems to be that while the treaties are admitted to be still in force, His Majesty&apos;s Government reserve to themselves the right of judging the circumstances under which help may be given or withheld.8. Nothing appears to have occurred since these conclusions were reached by Sir E. Grey and Sir E. Hertslet, to necessitate any modification of them. The present situation would therefore seem to be that His Majesty&apos;s Government can consent or decline to assist Portugal in any particular case of appeal under the treaties of friendship and alliance, judging each case on its merits.Foreign Office, November 13, 1922.* The Portuguese ratification copy of the treaty contains very material differences. The point is more fully dealt with in Annex II.
Annex I.Treaties of Alliance between Great Britain and Portugal.1. Treaty signed at London, June 16, 1373.(Translation.) (Extract.)Article 1.In the first place, we settle and covenant that there shall be from this day forward between our above said Lord Edward, King of England and France, and the Lord Ferdinand, King of Portugal and Algarve, and the Lady Eleanor, Queen and his consort, their successors in the aforesaid kingdoms of England and Portugal, and their realms, lands, dominions, provinces, vassals and subjects faithfully obeying them, whatsoever true, faithful, constant, mutual, and perpetual friendships, unions, alliances, and leagues of sincere affection, and that as true and faithful friends they shall henceforth reciprocally be friends to friends, and enemies to enemies, and shall assist, maintain, and uphold each other mutually by sea and by land against all men that may live or die, of whatever dignity, station, rank or condition they may be, and against their lands, realms, and dominions.They shall strive for and preserve, as much as in them lies, the personal safety, security, interest, and honour, and the harmlessness, conservation, and restitution of their rights, property, effects, and friends, wheresoever they be.They shall every where faithfully prevent the hurts and injuries, disgrace, or baseness which they know or which one party knows to be at any future time intended or contemplated against the other party, and shall provide remedies for them; and they shall as expeditiously as may be by letters or messengers, or in any better wTay which they can contrive, without reserve, and fully inform, forewarn, and usefully counsel the other party against whom such things are meditating, relative to what has just been mentioned.Article 2.Also, neither party shall form friendships with the enemies, rivals, or perse-cutors of the other party; or knowingly himself or through others advise, aid, or favour the enemies, rivals, or persecutors of the other party, to his detriment, hurt, or prejudice; or gratify them in any way, receive them into his kingdom or kingdoms, lands, dominions, provinces, or places, or knowingly suffer them to be gratified, received, countenanced, or harboured, either publicly or privately under any specious excuses, contrivances, or pretexts; without, however, including under the denomination-tion of enemies, rivals, or persecutors, such as shall now or hereafter for any reason whatsoever have fled, been exiled, or banished from the kingdom, or from the other provinces-, lands, dominions, or places of either of the same Kings, but, on the contrary, declaring it lawful reciprocally to grant to such persons reception and countenance in the kingdom, and in any lands and places subjected to the other King, unless, indeed, such fugitives, exiles and outlaws shall have been capitally convicted of high treason, and as traitors to the King and the kingdom, or shall lie under the suspicion of having afforded occasion for reasonable fear of their design to compass the hurt, disgrace, injury, or exasperation of both parties or of either of them, so that they ought to be justly avoided as foes and persecutors; in which case either party, on being&quot;required&apos;by the other, shall be obliged either to deliver up such men as have been before described, if demanded, to the requiring party, or to expel, banish, or dismiss them from his vicinity, his kingdoms, dominions, and lands.Article 3.Also, if the kingdom, lands, dominions, or places of the other party should happen to be infested, oppressed, or invaded by sea or by land, by enemies, persecutors, or rivals, or if these enemies should at least purpose, prepare, or in any manner appear anxious to infest, oppress, or invade, and the other party, or his successors, be through that party against whom similar attempts are making, by letters or by trusty messengers, applied to for assistance or succour of troops, archers, slingers, ships, galleys sufficiently armed for war, or any other kind of defence (provided such defence, or any of those before mentioned, exist or be used in the kingdom of which the above succour is demanded), then shall the said party so
srequired bond fide furnish, supply, and send the said succour to the requiring party for the protection of the kingdom menaced with such invasions, or of the other provinces, dominions, or places, and for the recovery of them when lost by the like invasions against the said enemies, invaders, or persecutors, or against such as intend to invade or persecute, of whatever station, condition, rank, and dignity they may be, as often as and whenever such party shall, without great injury to his country, be able to spare a certain proportion of armed troops, archers, slingers, ships, and galleys, sufficiently supplied with all requisites and other kinds of defence (except when their price is excessive or they are needed in the country), at the cost, expense, and pay of the party requiring, to be strictly estimated by four military men of experience, or able and discreet members of the legal profession (of whom two are to be deputed or chosen by each party), according to the quality of the individuals to be sent, and their grades, to the circumstances of the times, and to the markets of the places in which the persons despatched shall have to exert their valour of military skill, within such time as, after the aforesaid requisition, a similar succour ought to be prepared and sent, regard being had both to the pressing occasion of the party requiring, and to the possibility of the party called upon being able to complete his preparations; it being understood that throughout these proceedings no duplicity and unfairness shall appear, but that the straight path of equitable dealing and benignity shall be pursued.Given and done in the royal city of London, at the great Cathedral Church of the same, at the festival of the New Solemnity of the Body of Christ, that is to say, on the 16th day of the month of June, in the year of our Lord 1373, of the Indiction the 11th, and of the Pontificate of the Lord Pope Gregory the XIth. the 3rd year.2. Treaty signed at Windsor, May 9, 1386.(Translation.) (Extract.)Article 1.First of all,.it is settled and finally agreed that, to ensure the public good and the tranquillity&quot;both of the Kings and the subjects of either kingdom, there shall be inviolate, and endure for ever, between the above Kings now reigning, and their heirs and successors, and between the subjects of both kingdoms, a solid, perpetual, and real league, amity, confederacy, and union, not only in behalf of themselves, and their heirs and successors, but also in favour of the kingdoms, lands, dominions, and countries, and their subjects, vassals, allies, and friends whatsoever, so that either of them shall be bound to succour and afford aid to the other against all men that may live and die who shall attempt to violate the peace of the other, or injure its State in any way; wherefrom, however, shall, by desire of the King of England, be excepted our Lord the Supreme Pontiff Urban, now reigning, and his successors, canonically elected, and the Lords &quot;Wenzeslas, by the grace of God King of the Romans and of Bohemia, and John, by the same grace King of Castile and Leon, Duke of Lancaster, and uncle of the said illustrious Lord King of England.Article 3.Further, it is mutually agreed that it shall not by any means be permitted to the said Kings, or to any of their subjects, lands and dominions, of whatsoever station, degree, or condition, to give or afford in any manner counsel, aid, or favour to any land, dominion, or nation, which shall be at enmity with or rebelling against either party, or to let, to farm, or assign to such enemies any ships, galleys, or other vessels that might be converted to the prejudice of the other, or to give, directly or indirectly, publicly or clandestinely, any countenance, of whatever kind or nature it might be, to such enemies or rebels, under whatever plea, title, palliation, or colour; or to administer and extend to such enemies or rebels any succour that may redound to the prejudice of the other party; on the contrary, that either of the aforesaid Kings and their kingdoms, lands, and dominions, as well as their heirs, shall be obliged to discourage, pursue, and destroy, with all their might, the enemies and rebels of the other, the same as their own mortal enemies; and if any subject of either party be convicted to have attempted anything against what has here been laid down, he shall, without subterfuge, or simulation, be punished according to law, and agreeably to the will and pleasure of that King in whose prejudice the attempt shall thus have been made.

Treaty signed at Lisbon, May 16, 1703.(Extract.)  -Article 1.All former treaties between the above-said Powers are hereby approved, con-firmed, and ratified, and are ordered to be exactly and faithfully observed, except in so far as by the present treaty is otherwise provided and established; so that there shall be between the said kingdoms and States, their people and subjects, a sincere friendship and perfect amity; they shall all of them mutually assist one another; and each of the said Powers shall promote the interest and advantage of the rest, as if it were his own.Article 2.If ever it shall happen that the Kings of Spain and Prance, either the present or future, that both of them together, or either of them separately, shall make war, or give occasion to suspect that they intend to make war, upon the Kingdom of Portugal, either on the Continent of Europe or in its dominion beyond seas, Her Majesty the Queen of Great Britain, and the Lords, the States-General, shall use their friendly offices with the said Kings, or either of them, in order to persuade them to observe the terms of peace towards Portugal, and not to make war upon it.Article 3.But these good offices not proving successful, but altogether ineffectual, so that war should be made by the aforesaid Kings, or by either of them, upon Portugal, the above-mentioned Powers of Great Britain and Holland shall make war, with all their force, upon the aforesaid Kings or King who shall carry hostile arms into Portugal; and towards that war which shall he carried on in Europe, they shall supply 12,000 men, whom they shall arm and pay, as well when in quarters as in action; and the said High Allies shall be obliged to keep that number of men complete, by recruiting it from time at their own expense.Article 4.And in this case also the aforesaid Powers of Great Britain and Holland shall be obliged to keep and maintain upon the coast of Portugal, and in its harbours, a competent number of men-of-war to defend the said coasts and harbours, the trade and merchant-ships, from all hostile attempts; so that if it shall appear that the said harbours and ships are in danger of being attacked with a greater force by the enemy, the said High Allies shall be obliged to send to Portugal such a number of men-of-war as shall be equal, or even superior, to the ships and force of the enemy who shall meditate an attack upon the above-said ships and harbours.Article 5.But if the foresaid Kings of Spain and Prance, or either of them, shall make war or give occasion to suspect that they intend to make war, upon the provinces or dominions of Portugal beyond seas, the above-mentioned Powers of Great Britain and Holland shall furnish to His Portuguese Majesty such a number of men-of-war
as shall be equal, or even superior, to the ships of the enemy; so that he may be able not only to oppose them, but even to prevent such attack or invasion, as long as the war shall last, or occasion require. And if the enemy shall take any town or seize any place, which they may fortify, in the foresaid provinces and dominions beyond seas, these succours shall continue until such town or place be fully recovered, or more towns and places, if more should be taken.Article 6.All these auxiliary ships shall be subject to the command of His Portuguese Majesty, so that they shall perform whatever shall be enjoined by His said Majesty; and if they should sail to the Portuguese provinces and dominions beyond seas, they shall there likewise perform whatever shall be enjoined them, in the name of His Majesty, by his Viceroys and Governors.Article 7.When these auxiliary ships of the two Powers of Great Britain and Holland shall be joined with the Portuguese ships (in which case they must always assist them), the admiral of the Portuguese fleet who has the right of carrying the flag, shall give signals, and summon to a council of war, which shall be held in his own cabin; and the same admiral of the Portuguese fleet shall issue the necessary orders for executing those points which shall have been resolved upon in the council of war, which points the admirals of the auxiliary ships shall execute, each with his own ships.Article s.But if, at any time, the ships of three allied nations shall be conjoined in order to attempt anything in which all the allies are equally interested, the admiral who has the right of carrying the flag, and has under his command the greatest number of ships of his own nation, shall enjoy the right and privilege mentioned in the former article, viz., of giving signals, of summoning to a council of war in his own cabin, and of doing every other thing requisite, as is above specified.Article 9.The 12,000 men, which the Powers of Great Britain and Holland are bound to furnish to His Portuguese Majesty, and to maintain at their own expense, and occasionally recruit, during the continuance of the war, as stipulated in article 3 of this treaty, shall be subject, not only to the supreme command of His Portuguese Majesty, but also to that of his commanders or generals, and even of such of his officers as by their rank in the army are superior to them. But for breach of orders, and for the crimes and enormities of which they shall be guilty, they shall be punished by the commanders or generals of their own army, in the same manner as the Portuguese themselves are punished by martial law, especially for those crimes which regard the violation of religion.Article 10.The High Allies shall, in the case above-mentioned, grant full liberty, and all kind of aid and assistance to the Commissaries of His Portuguese Majesty, to export from their territories and harbours all sorts of military stores, such as powder, balls, arms, corn, and every other kind of ammunition that shall be desired of them, as well belonging to the sea as the land service, and that, too, at the same price as the said High Allies are wont to purchase them for their own use, and without the least alteration in the charge.Article 11.If ever it should happen that the Kings of Spain and France, or either of them, should make war upon the Kingdom of Great Britain, or the States of the United Provinces, His Majesty the King of Portugal shall use his friendly offices with the said Kings, or with either of them, in order to persuade them to observe the terms of peace towards the aforesaid Kingdom of Great Britain, and the States of the United Provinces.
But these good offices not proving successful, but altogether ineffectual, so that war shall be made by the aforesaid Kings, or by either of them, upon the Kingdom of Great Britain, or the States of the United Provinces, His Majesty the King of Portugal shall, in like manner, be bound to make war, with all his force, upon the aforesaid Kings, or upon either of them; and in this case, likewise, the aforesaid two Powers of Great Britain, and the States of the United Provinces, shall furnish him with the same succours of men and ships as in the preceding articles are stipulated, in case the Kings of France and Spain, or either of them, should make Avar upon Portugal, and everything shall be executed in the manner there specified.Article 13.As well in the first as in the second manner of carrying on the war, His Majesty the King of Portugal shall be bound to maintain ten ships of war for his own defence and that of his allies, with this proviso, however, that if both the Spaniards and the French or the Spaniards only, should make Avar upon the High Allies, in that case the ten ships of war of His Portuguese Majesty shall not be bound to depart from the coast of Portugal, because, Avhile in that station, they will be of very great use in dividing the force of the enemy; but if Avar should be made by the French only, it shall then be laAvful for the Portuguese ships to assist the High Allies, in conjunction with their own fleets. *kArticle WtNo peace nor truce shall be made but by the common consent of the three Allies, and this league shall be perpetual and eternal.Article 19.In time of peace there shall be admitted into the greater ports of the Kingdom of Portugal six ships of Avar of each of the nations of Great Britain and the United Provinces, besides other six ships, Avhich Avere permitted by virtue of former treaties, so that in the Avhole twelve ships may be admitted, and all in the same manner as the former six were permitted. And into the lesser ports there shall be admitted such a number of ships as they can conveniently receive.Article 20.The said Plenipotentiaries promise that their above-mentioned Sovereigns shall ratify this treaty in due and lawful form; and that the ratifications shall be exchanged in this royal city of Lisbon, within the space of three months, counting from the time of subscribing.In witness Avhereof, Ave, the above-named plenipotentiaries of Her Majesty the Queen of Great Britain, and of the High and Mighty Lords the States-General of the United Provinces, have signed this instrument, and thereto set our seals. And the Plenipotentiaries of His Portuguese Majestjr, in order to avoid the controA^ersy that subsists concerning the prerogatiA&apos;e of the place, between the Crowns of Great Britain and Portugal, have, agreeable to the manner and custom observed betAveen the two Crowns, separately signed and sealed another instrument of the same tenour, changing only those particulars AAdrich, on account of this circumstance, were to be changed,8. Treaty Signed at Vienna, Jamiary 22, 1815. (Translation.) ^(Extract.)Article 3.The Treaty of Alliance concluded at Rio de Janeiro on the 19th February, 1810, being founded on circumstances of a temporary nature, Avhich have happily ceased to exist, the said treaty is hereby declared to be void in all its parts, and of no effect, without prejudice, however, to the ancient treaties of alliance, friendship, and guarantee, Avhich have so long and so happily subsisted between the two Crowns, and which are hereby renewed by the high contracting parties, and acknoAvledged to be of full force and effect.
&apos;J. Despatch from Earl Granville to Her Majesty&apos;s Minister at Madrid.(Extract.) Foreign Office, February 19, 1873.The Spanish Minister called upon me on the loth instant, and said, in the course of conversation, that he desired to speak to me on a delicate matter.It was known, he said, that there was a disposition on the part of the Republican Party in Spain towards a union with Portugal, and there were some Republicans in Portugal who would be ready to assist in such a project. If it was generalhy believed in Spain that such a project could be carried out without opposition from Europe, the Spanish Government might not be able to stop some aggressive movement.He said that he did not put any question to me that required an answer, but was glad to give me an opportunity of saying anything that occurred to me.I said that the best answer that I could give him was to state that Great Britain had always disclaimed the wish to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries; but there were treaty engagements betAveen Portugal and Great Britain to defend Portugal against external aggression, and that the Spaniards could not count upon the indifference of England to an external attack upon Portugal.I belieA^ed that to be an ansAArer to his question.annex II.The Secret Article of the Treaty of 1661.A curious discovery has recently been made by the Foreign Office Library in regard to this secret article.2. The version published at various times since 1847 in British parliamentary papers Avas apparently obtained from G. Chalmers&apos;s &quot;Treaties, &amp;e, betAveen Great Britain and Foreign PoAvers,&quot; published in 1790. A comparison of this version Avith that contained in the Portuguese ratification of the treaty, Avhich, in the absence of the original treaty (Avhich cannot be traced) may presumably be regarded as authoritative, has brought to light very material and vital discrepancies. The ratification version contains no general provisions at all, but deals purely with the circumstances of the moment. In particular, it does not contain in any form the general obligation on the King of Great Britain to defend all conquests or colonies of the CroAvn of Portugal against all its enemies, future as well as present, Avhich appears in the other A&apos;ersion.3. The two Arersions are given beknv in parallel columns : English Version of Secret Article.Over and above all and singular agreed and concluded in the Treaty of Marriage between the Most Serene and Most PoAverful Charles, the second of that name, King of Great Britain, and the Most Virtuous and Serene Lady Catherine, Infanta of Portugal, it is by this secret article concluded and accorded that His Majesty of Great Britain, in regard of the great advan-tages and increase of dominion he hath purchased by the above-mentioned Treaty of Marriage, shall promise and oblige himself, as by this present article he doth, to defend and protect all conquests or colonies belonging to the Crown of Portugal against all his enemies, as Avell future as present; moreover, His Majesty of Great Britain doth oblige himself to mediate a good peace betAveen the King of Portugal and the States of the United Provinces, and all companies or societies of merchantsPortuguese Ratification Version of Secret Article.In addition to all and each of the matters agreed to and concluded by the Marriage Treaty betAA7een the Most Serene and Mighty Prince Charles II, King of Great Britain and Her Most Serene Highness Dona Catharina, Infanta of Portugal, the following is also agreed and arranged by the present secret article, that is to say: That the said King of Great Britain shall use his best endeavours and apply all efforts and expedients in order that a good and stable peace may be arrived at betAveen His Most Serene Majesty the King of Portugal and the States-General of the United Provinces, and will include the said King of Portugal in any settle-ment made with the said States; and should the latter refuse to accept con-ditions Avhich may be just, secure and honourable for the said King of Portugal, then the said King of Great Britain

In case, also, that any towns, forts, castles or any other places shall be taken by the Dutch, after the 1st of May, this present year 1661, then His Majesty of Great Britain doth promise and engage to oblige the Dutch to a full and perfect restitution thereof. His Majesty of Great Britain doth, moreover, oblige him-self to send, the next monsoon ensuing after the ratification of the Treaty of Marriage and this article, a convenient succour to the East Indies, proportion-able to the necessity of Portugal and strength of our enemies.

The King of Great Britain shall ask for no pay-ment or compensation whatsoever for any help or assistance so rendered to the King of Portugal for these purposes.4. This curious difference between the two versions resulted in the extraordinary position that the text relied upon by His Majesty&apos;s Government laid Great Britain under a far-reaching obligation which, so far as the Portuguese version was concerned, did not exist.5. This anomaly, however, no longer exists. For in the Secret Anglo-Portuguese Declaration of 1899, the binding clause of the British version of the secret article was inserted -with a Portuguese text corresponding to it and was solemnly confirmed. His Majesty&apos;s Government, therefore, in that document clearly accepted what they believed to be their obligations under the secret article, and since that date they are clearly bound to honour those obligations.Appendix II.Anglo-Portuguese Secret Declaration, 1899.&apos; THE Government of Her Majesty the Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, Empress of India, and the Government of His Most Faithful Majesty the King of Portugal and the Algaryes, considering as of full force and effect the ancient treaties of alliance, amity and guarantee which subsist between the two Crowns, specifically confirm on this occasion article 1 of the treaty of the 29th January, 1642, which runs as follows : &quot;It is concluded and accorded that there is, and shall be for ever, a good true and firm peace and amity between the most renowned Kings, Charles King of Great Britain and John the Fourth King of Portugal, their heirs and successors, and their kingdoms, countries, dominions, lands, people, liegemen, . vassals and subjects whomsoever, present and to come, of whatsoever condition, dignity or degree they may be, as well by land as by sea and fresh waters, so as the said vassals and subjects are each of them to favour the other and to use one another with friendly offices and true affection, and that neither of the said
most renowned Kings, their heirs and successors, by himself or by any other, shall do or attempt anything against each other, or their kingdoms, by land or by sea, nor shall consent nor adhere unto any war, counsel, or treaty, in prejudice of the other.&apos;&apos;&apos; 5They equally confirm the final article of the treaty of the 23rd June, 1661, of which the first part runs as follows : &quot; Over and above all and singular agreed and concluded in the Treaty of Marriage between the Most Serene and Most Powerful Charles, the Second of that name, King of Great Britain and the Most Virtuous and Serene Lady Catherine, Infanta of Portugal, it is by the secret article concluded and accorded, that His Majesty of Great Britian, in regard of the great advantages and increase of dominion, he hath purchased by the above-mentioned Treaty of Marriage, shall promise and oblige himself, as by this present article he doth, to defend and protect all conquests or colonies belonging to the Crown of Portugal against all his enemies, as well future as present.&apos;&apos;The Government of His Most Faithful Majesty undertakes not to permit, after the declaration of war between Great Britain and the South African Republic, or during the continuance of the war, the importation and passage of arms, and of munitions of war destined for the latter.The Government of His Most Faithful Majesty will not proclaim neutrality in the war between Great Britain and the South African Republic.Done in duplicate, at London, this 14th day of October, 1899.o
