[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty &apos;s Government. JPrinted for the Cabinet.   October 1927. SECRET. ^1CP. 259 (27)MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA.The Statutory Commission on Indian Constitutional Reforms.I have to request the concurrence oi my colleagues in certain alterations I have found it necessary to make in the proposals agreed to by the Cabinet on 20th July last (Cabinet 42 (27)). These changes are the result of prolonged consultation with the Viceroy and with the Chairman-designate of the Commission.(1) 1 proposed in July that the Viceroy should this autumn announce the decision to set up the Commission next spring, but that no steps should be taken until the beginning of next session (February 192S) to announce the names of the Commissioners, or to carry out tho procedure contemplated by the Act for their appointment. But this scheme involved a long delay between the announcement of the names of the Coinmis-sioners and the autumn of 1923, when they could begin their work in India. In the intervening period they would bo subject to continual indirect attempts to influence them and to the suspicion of being so influenced. In agreement with the Viceroy and the Chairman-designate I have now come to the conclusion that the names of the Commissioners should be announced shortly and that the Commission should pay a preliminary visit to India in January-March next and not defer its visit till the autumn of 192S.(2) This affects the immediate Parliamentary programme. As I indicated in my Memorandum of 12th July last (CP. 187 (27)), the antedating of the Commission involves an amendment of the Act. I had at first contemplated that this could be done more or less at leisure, say in February, and that we could meanwhile proceed extra-statutorily to do exactly what the Act provides. There are grave objections to that course. If the constitutional standing of the Commission is not from the beginning beyond question the temptation to boycott it will be the greater ; and if the amending Bill is postponed until after the Commission has begun its work, and its proceedings are attacked, the opposition to the Bill may be more serious than is probable if it is introduced at once. It is essential, therefore, to get a 2-clause BiU (a copy of which I append to this note) passed at the earliest possible date in Novera ber.(3) I propose that the announcement should be made here in Parliament and simultaneously in India of the complete programme contemplated for the Commission and the names of its members, and that this announcement shoidd be followed immediately by the introduction of the Bill referred to above. It will still be necessary, besides finding time for the Bill, to find&apos; time for the Resolutions required of each house by the Act. But it is reasonable to anticipate that all that is to be said ou the personnel of the Commission will be said on the second reading of the Bill and that the Resolutions will not necessitate much, if any, further discussion, or else that the Bill will go through more or less sub silentio and that discussion will he reserved for the Resolutions.I append to this note a copy of the announcement which the Viceroy proposes to make in India on the same day as the announcement is made in Parliament here, which, I hope, will be on the first day of the session.India Office, B1RKEN1IEAD.31st October 1927.2350      100   10/27

Government of India (Statutory Commission).DRAFTof aBILLTo amend section 84a of the Govern-ment of India Act with respect to the time for the appointment of a Statutory Commission thereunder.GUI.   (1.)2Gth October 1027.123-1
Draft of announcement to be made by the Viceroy.&quot; Eight, years ago the British Parliament enacted a statute which regulated the conditions under which India might learn by actual experience whether or not the Western system of representative government was the most appropriate means through which she might attain responsible self-government within the Empire. That statute never professed to incorporate irrevocable decisions and recognised that its work must of necessity be reviewed in the light of fuller knowledge with the lapse of years. Parliament accordingly enacted that, at the end of 10 years at least, a Statutory Commission should be appointed to examine and report upon the progress made.&quot;2. Considerable pressure has during recent years been exercised to secure the anticipation of the statute, but His Majesty&apos;s Government has hitherto lelt that circumstances in India were not such as to justify, in the interests of India itself, advancement of the date at which future development of the constitution would be considered. So long as unwise counsels of political non-co-operation prevailed it was evident that the conditions requisite for calm appraisement of a coaiplicated constitutional problem were lacking, and that an earlier enquiry would have been likely only to crystallise in opposition two points of view between which it must be the aim and the duty of statesmanship to effect  reconciliation. But there have been signs latterly that while those who have been foremost in advancing the claims of India to full self-government have in no way abandoned the principles they have felt it their duty to assert, yet there is in many quarters a greater disposition to deal with the actual facts of the situation and to appreciate what I believe to be most indubitably true, namely, that the differences which exist on these matters are differences of method or pace and not differences of principle or disagreements as to the goal which we all alike desire to reach.&quot; 3. It is also certain that the review, if it is to be thorough and deal adequately with the issues that will claim attention, will have much ground to cover, and. both for this stage and for those that will necessarily follow, it is important to ensure a sufficient allowance of time without unduly prolonged postponing of the date by which final action could be undertaken.&quot;4. There is another element in the present position which is immediately relevant to the question of when the work of the Commission should begin. We are all aware of the great, the unhappily great, part played in the life of India recently by communal tension and antagonism and of the obstacles thus imposed to Indian political development. It might be argued that in such circumstances it was desirable to delay the institution of the Commission as long as possible, in the hope that this trouble might in the meantime abate. On the other hand, it seems not impossible that the uncertainty of what constitutional change might be imminent may have served to sharpen this antagonism and that each side may have been, consciously or unconsciously, actuated by desire to strengthen, as they supposed, their relative positions in anticipation of the Statutoiy Commission. Wherever such activities may first begin, the result is to create a vicious circle in which all communities are likely to feel themselves constrained to extend their measure of self-defence. The fact that these fierce antagonisms are irreconcilable with the whole idea of Indian nationalism has not been powerful enough to exercise its influence over great numbers of people in all classes, and 1 suspect that the communal issue is so closely interwoven in the political that suspense and uncertainty in regard to the political react rapidly and unfavourably upon the communal situatiou. Fear is frequently the parent of bad temper, and when men are afraid, as they are to-day, of the effect unknown political changes may have, they are abnormally ready to seek relief from and an outlet for their fears in violence and hasty action. In so far as these troubles are the product of suspense, one may hope for some relief through action taken to limit the period of -uncertainty.&quot; 5. Having regard to such considerations as these, His Majesty&apos;s Government has decided to invite Parliament to advance the date of the enquiry and to assent forthwith to the establishment of the Commission.   Subject to the obtaining of this necessary
authority, His Majesty&apos;s Government hope that the Commission will proceed to India as early as possible in the new year for a short visit, returning to India in October for the performance of their main task.&quot; 6. The task of the Commission will be no easy one. In the governing words of the statute which will constitute its terms of reference, it will be charged with &apos; enquiring into the working of the system of government, the growth of education and the development of representative institutions in British India and matters connected therewith, and the Commission shall report as to whether and to what extent it is desirable to establish the principles of responsible government or to extend, modify or restrict the degree of responsible government then existing therein, including the question whether the establishment of second Chambers of local legislatures is or is not desirable.&apos;&quot; 7. His Majesty&apos;s Government have naturally given careful thought to the most appropriate agency for the conducting of an enquiry so comprehensive and tinrestricted.&quot; S. The question of what should be the composition of the Commission is one to winch tho answer must inevitably be greatly influenced by the nature of the task which Parliament has to perform in the light of its advice. In order that the decision at which His Majesty&apos;s Government have arrived may be fully tmderstood, it is necessary to state in a few words what they conceive that task to be. If it were simply the drawing up of a constitution which Parliament, which must in any circumstances be the final arbiter, would impose on India from without, the problem would be compaiatively simple. But that is not how His Majesty&apos;s Government conceive it. The preamble to the Act of 1919 recognised, in effect, that with the development of Indian political thought during the last generation, legitimate aspirations towards responsible government had been formed of which account must he taken. His Majesty&apos;s present Government desire no less to take account of those aspirations, and their hope is to lay before Parliament after the investigation into facts prescribed by the Act conclusions which shall, so far as is practicable, have been reached by agreement with all parties concerned. It is with this object steadily in view that His Majesty&apos;s Government have considered both the composition of the Commission and theprocedure to be followed in dealing wich its report.9. It would be generally agreed that what is required is a Commission which would be unbiassed and competent to present an accurate picture of the facts to Parliament, but it must also be a body on whose recommendations Parliament should he found willing to take action which a study of these facts may indicate to be appropriate:10. To fulfil the first requirement it would follow that the Commission should be such as may approach its task with sympathy and a real desire to assist India to the utmost of its power, but. with a mind free from preconceived conclusions on either side. It is, however, open to doubt whether a Commission constituted so as to include a substantial proportion of Indian members and, as it rightly would, British official members also would be thought, to satisfy the first condition of reaching conclusions unaffected by any process of a priori reasoning. On the one hand, it might be felt that the desire, natural and legitimate, of the Indian members to see India a self-governing nation, could hardly fail to colour their judgment of her present capacity to sustain the role,&apos; on the other hand, there are those who might hold that British official members would be less than &quot;human if their judgment were not in some degree affected by long and close contact with the questions to which they would now be invited to apply impartial minds.11. But even after such a Commission had written its report Parliament would inevitably approach consideration of it with some element of mental reservation due to an instinctive-feeling that the advice in more than one case represented views to which the holder was previously committed. It would move uncertainly among conclusions of the exact value of which, owing to unfamiliarity with tho minds of their 1&apos;ramers, it would feel unable to appreciate.12. We should, however, make a great mistake if we supposed that these matters were purely constitutional or could be treated merely as the subject of judicial investigation. Indian opinion has a clear title to ask that in the elaboration of a new instrument of government their solution of the problem or their judgment
\on other solutions which may be proposed should be made an integral factor in the examination of the question and be given due weight in the ultimate decision. It is, therefore, essential to find means by which Indians may be made parties to deliberations so nearly affecting the future of their country.&quot;13. Balancing these various considerations and endeavouring to give due weight .to each, His Majesty&apos;s Government have decided upon the following procedure: &quot;(a) they propose to recommend to His Majesty that the Statutory Commission should be composed as follows: &quot;(/)) His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot of course dictate to the Commission what procedure it shall follow, hut they are of opinion that its task in taking evidence would be greatly facilitated if it were to invite the Central Legislature to appoint a Joint Select Committee chosen from its elected and nominated unofficial members which would draw up its views and proposals in writing and lay them before the Commission for examination in such manner as the latter nuvy decide. This Committee might remain in being for any consultation which the Commission might desire at subsequent stages oE the enquiry. It should be clearly understood that the purpose of this suggestion is not to limit the discretion of the Commission in hearing other witnesses :&apos;&quot;&apos; (c) His Majesty&apos;s Government suggest that a similar procedure should be adopted with the provincial legislatures :&quot;(d) the vast area to be covered may make it desirable that the task of taking evidence on the more purely administrative questions involved should be undertaken by some other authority which would be in the closest touch with the Commission. His Majesty&apos;s Government suggest that the Commission on arrival in India should consider and decide by what machinery this work may most appropriately be discharged. This will not, of course, debar the Commission from the advantage of taking evidence itself upon these subjects to whatever extent it may think desirable:&quot; (e) When the Commission has reported and its report has been examined by the Government of India and His Majesty&apos;s Government it will be the duty of the latter to present proposals to Parliament. But it is not the intention of His Majesty&apos;s Government to ask Parliament to adopt these proposals without first giving a full opportunity for Indian opinion of different schools to contribute its view upon them. And to this end it is intended to invite Parliament to refer these proposals to consideration by a Joint Committee of both Houses and to facilitate the presentation of the views of the Indian Central Legislature to that Committee by delegations who will be invited to attend and confer with the Joint Committee.&quot; 14. In the opinion of His Majesty&apos;s Government, the procedure contemplated fulfils, to a very great extent, the requisites outlined above. Such a Commission, drawn from men of every British political party and pi-esided over by one whose public position is due to outstanding ability and character, will evidently bring fresh, trained and unaffected judgment to bear upon an immensely complex constitutional issue.&quot; .15. Moreover, the findings of some of its own members can count in advance upon a favourable reception at the hands of Parliament, which will recognise them to be speaking from a common platform of thought and to be applying the standards of judgment which Parliament will feel instinctively to be its own. For myself, I cannot doubt that the quickest and surest path of those who desire Indian progress is by persuasion of Parliament, and that they can do this more certainly through members of both Houses of Parliament than in any other way. The India U Nationalist has gained much if he can convince the Members of Parliament on the spot; and I would therefore go further and say that, if those who speak for India have confidence in the case which they advance on her behalf, they ought to welcome such an opportuuitj&apos;-being afforded to as many members of the British Legislature as maybe, thus to eomo into contact with the realties of Indian life and politics.&quot; 1C. Furthermore, while it is, for these reasons, of undoubted advantage to all who desire an extension of the Reforms that their case should be heard in the first instance by those who cau command the unquestioned confidence of Parliament, I am sanguine enough to suppose that the method chosen by His Majesty&apos;s Government
will also assure to Indians a better opportunity than they could have enjoyed in any other way of influencing the passage of these great events. For not only will they, through representatives of the Indian Legislatures, be enabled to express themselves freely to the Commission itself, but it will also be within their power to challenge in detail or principle any of the proposals made by IIis Majesty&apos;s Government before the Joint Select Committee of Parliament and to advocate their own solutions. It should be observed, moreover, that at this stage Parliament will not have been asked to express any opinion on particular proposals and therefore, so far as Parliament is concerned, the whole field will still be open.&quot;17. I hope that there will be none, whatever may be their political opinions, who will fail to take advantage of this potent means thus presented to them of establishing direct contact between the Indian and British peoples. There will be some whose inclination it may be will prompt them to condemn the scheme of procedure on which His Majest.y&apos;s Government has decided. Others may criticise this or that part of the proposals. The reply to these last is that the plan outlined stands as a single comprehensive whole and should bo so regarded. Of the first I would ask in all sincerity whether disagreement on the particular machinery to effect the end which we all alike pursue, is sufficient ground for any man to stand aside and decline to lend his weight to the joint effort of the peoples that this undertaking represents.&quot; IS. I have never concealed from myself that there are, and will be, differences of opinion between the two peoples, just as there are differences of opinion within Great Britain and India on these matters; it is through disagreements accenting clashes of judgment that, it is given to us ultimately to approach knowledge of the truth. It is also inevitable that on issues so momentous differences of judgment will be founded on deep and sincere conviction. But, if difficult, our general line of conduct is surely plain : where possible it is our duty to bring these differences to agreement; where this is at any given moment not practicable without the surrender of something fundamental to our position, it is our duty to differ as friends, each respecting the standpoint of the other and each being careful to see that we say or do nothing that will needlessly aggravate differences which we are unable immediately to resolve.&quot; 19. The effect  hat such differences will have upon the relations between the two countries will depend on something which lies deeper than the differences themselves. All friendships are subject at times to strains Avhich try tempers and lay men under the necessity of exercising considerable forbearance and restraint. Such strains are indeed a sovereign test; for just as one is the stronger for rising superior to temptation to which another yields, so true friendship flourishes on the successful emergence from the very test which would dissolve any less firmly founded partnership. In real friendship each party is constrained to see the best in the other&apos;s case, to give credit for the best motives and place the most charitable interpretation upon actions which they might wish otherwise. Above all, friends will strive to correct differences by appealing to the many things on which they are agreed rather than lightly imperil friendship by insistence on points in regard to which they take conflicting views.&quot; 20. Thus I woidd fain trust it would be in the present case. I do not think I am mistaken if I assert that it is the fixed determination of the overwhelming majority of citizens both of India and Great Britain to hold firmly by the goodwill which through many trials, and it may be through some false stej)s on the part of each, has meant much to both in each country. There may from time to time be misunderstanding of the other. Let us not magnify such things beyond their value : least of all let us not permit such transient influences to lead us to lose sight of the rich prize of achievement of a common purpose which we may assuredly win together but can hardly win in separation. It is my most earnest hope that this joint endeavour to solve a problem on the wise treatment of which so much depends may be inspired by such a spirit as shall offer good hope of reaching an issue to the great and abiding good of India and of all her sons.&quot;
