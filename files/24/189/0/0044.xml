(THIS DOCUMENT IS THS PROPERTY Oi&apos; HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMiSNT)CAB IN ST R3DUCTI0H AND IMITATION OF ARMAMENTS. THB FINNISH PROPOSAL.-Memorandum by the Chanoollor of the duchy, of Lanoaster.In conformity with what was decided at the last meeting of the Cabinet Committee.  I discussed the Finnish proposal for Financial assistance to a State victim of aggression, with a Treasury official, with particular regard to tho liabilities which His Majesty1s Government v/ould thereby incur.   Details of the scheme are still under discussion hy the Finance Committee of the League, of which Sir 0. Niemeyor is a member.    As the proposal now stands  50 millions is named as the outside figure for the loan,  and in respect cf this sum His Majesty^ Government would be called on to give two guarantees:-The remaining percentage 82-75 would be distributed among the States permanently represented on the Council and oertain other financially strong States not yet determined, but likely to include Holland and Switzerland.The super-guarantee, whioh is essential for the publio success of the loan, is not &quot;joint and several&quot; but undivided, so that in no case would His Majestyrs Government be liable, for more than the amount involvedCP.  294  (27).SECRET(l) a simple guarantee of approximately 10f  of the total, viz.,  5 millions;(2) a super-guarantee, covering in addition to our 07,&apos;n percentage those of certain weaker States,  to an extent of 16 - 2of,. viz.,  at tho most ^12-g- millions (which includes the  .5 millions under (l)).
therein, takon above as  12^&apos;nillions.     This is &quot;re-insured&quot;by the ordinary guarantee given by all States Members whoJoin in, ao that1*     The Public who subsoribe the  50 millions look to H.M. Government for, say,  12^ millions.E.     H.M. Government look to all tho Membersof the league for 12^- - 5 - j;7  millions.fc.     Everybody looks to the btate recipient of the loan- .!in the case of many States the simple guarantee whichthey give would for market purposes bo worthless, butpolitically It ia extromely desirable that every member state should be assooiated with a percentage of the totalloan.The operation of the scheme would he as follows First stage.     The Council (by unanimity) decide that a State has committed an aggression. Seoond stage.    The victim at ate appeals to the Council for financial assistance in raising a loan.Third stage.      The Council assents and decides the amount.In the case of a large-scale war such as the last,  It is evident that the scheme would not be applicable, but in the case say of a Jugo-Slav - Bulgar conflict, the assurance of a speedy  50 millions loan to tho victim would be a powerful deterrent to aggression,  and it may be argued that it is small wars that lead to large ones.Three advantages are claimed for the scheme;1,      as a deterrent against aggression;2.      as an Immensely preferable alternative to., and possible substitute for, the appllca-tion of the Blockade required under Article XVI of the Covenant;3.      as an inducement towards a general reduotion of armaments.
(&quot;The Committee will remember that Governmenthave only expressed their acceptance of the scheme subjeotto two conditions(l) a previous satisfactory measure of disarmament;(2) acceptance by the other principalStates of a satisfactory allocation of the guarantee. ).I have satisfied myself that this scheme is not likely to involve H.M. Government in responsibility for further immense war debts of ether countries; and that it ha3 more substance than most other edifices of peace.(Signed) CUSHSIDUN.ember 18th, 1927.
