SIR ATJSTEH CHAM33RLAI1J eskad tho members of tho Coaaittea&quot;to read tho text of the treaty which had just been circulated.    Ho explained that Sarwat Pasha could, at present, pledge no one but himself, but thct ho had mado it clear that ho would make tho draft troaty his own, much in the same way as Br, luthor and Herr Strosomerm had done in the case of Locarno,     He appeared to bo singularly confident that ho eouI3 carry it through.      i?or his part, Sir Austen Chamberlain recommended tho treaty most strongly to His majesty is Covornncn&quot;SIR V/ILLIAH JOiriJSOlT-HIGKS said that Mrc Henderson did not seem to bo so confident as Sarwat as to tho latter;s ability to carry the Treaty throughcSIR AUSTSi? CH-U 31R1AI1^ pointed out that Mr,, Handerscn. when writing had not soon the draft treaty which contained several points which might mako it acceptable to Egyptian opinion.    In reply to a question by Lord Salfour, he explained that the English, not the French, was the authoritative textcTH3 PRIMS MINISTER,  before calling on Sir Austen Chamberlain to give an explanation of the document, said ho wished in the first instance to lay one or two general considerations before the Committeeu    In Egypt we were bound to rely upon the Declaration of -February, 1922, until something was substituted for it.      &quot;The present draft was the result of p/hat amounted to an offer of co-operation, the first that we have ever received from a responsible Egyptian,     The greatest cars was nocessaiy in examining the provisions of the draft3 But it must be borne in mind that if the treaty weva rejected it wo aid be necessary to defend that rejection in public,     It-was therefore essential to convince public opinion here that in negotiation we had fairly gone to the furthest limits compatible with our own security.      The Middle East in 1927 was very different from what it had boon in 1914,    This fact made it all the more necessary to boar public opinion in mind-
SIR AUSTEN CHAM3SRLAIH also wished to offer 3onicpreliminary observations.    Although ho circulated a great volume of papors relating to foreign affairs to his colleagues, he felt some doubt whether they could appreciate fully thedelicacy and difficulty of the present international position. We had just atithorisod, contingently, forcible action at Hankow and Canton, and ouch acticn might at any time bo necessary clsewhero in China.     As to Europe, the activities of Macedonian revolutionaries! had produced a very delicate situation in tho Balkans:    Lithuania and Poland ware thoorot-icolly in a state of war;    our relations with America had entered a difficult phase, end the greatest skill might be called for in the next few months to avoid difficulties, there and elsewhere.    He wished the Committee to understand his own fooling oi* responsibility and anxiety which impelled him to lose no opportunity, rf sne presented itself, of clearing up at least one of the difficulties which confronted us.     A chance of doing so in the case of Egypt had come-somewhat unexpectedly-     What Sarwat Pasha came to this country with Eing Euad last summer there had been no idea beyond conversations, but the effect of these conversations upon Sarwat was such, rather to his surprise3 that Sarwat had submitted to him a draft treaty.      Though this was unacceptable, wo had presented Sarwat with a counter draft, approved by the Cabinet.      Throughout recent conversations he had endeavoured to keep Sarwat as close to this latter draft as possible, screwing him up to the utmost limit to which he could go while retaining any hope of getting his countrymen to accept the document,,Turning to tho present position, Sir Austen pointed out that we had declared Egypt independent, subject to certain reserves.     No Egyptian statesman had accepted these reserves specifically, though in practice they.had
generally speaking, been forced to conform to them.     Our highest legal authorities were of opinion that if Egypt were tc tekft us bofore the League Court9 there must bo a good do a&quot;.; of doubt as to the result.   Further, supposing that w  had to employ force against Egypta it would bo possiblo, under Article 11 of the Covenant, f*r any third State to bring thematter before the Leaguo.   While wo were on good tex-ms with the groat powers, it was in the highest degree unlikely that any of them would 6.0 so, but this did not apply to the smaller-, powers, on? of whom might chooso to take this action, and it was unwise completely to ignore this possibility.    In conclusion Sir Auston begged the Committee to consider the advantages which the treaty would conferoHe proceeded briefly to summarise the effect of each Article in the treaty and anncx0Having regard to past history, he confessed that he regarded it as extraordinary that any Egyptian should put his name to such a document-    He considered it shewed courage- and an appreciation, for the first time,, of the advantages to Egypt c- co-operation with us.    Much credit was, he thought, due to Sarwat. and he wished to claim some for himself. Before his recent conversations with Sarwat, indeed, he would frankly have regarded it as impossible that an Egyptian should promise his support to a treaty of this naturs0Article V, he realised,, might be a stumbling block to the Committee, but he for his part, accepted it.    He had fought hard, and had given Sarwat to understand that although ha was willing to bring Sarwatls proposals as to this Article before tho Committee, he did not consider that they were very/ likely to accept it.    But, viewing the treaty as a wholes-he had not only come to accept it himself, but wished to&apos;&apos; recommend its acceptance most strongly to the Committeea What in reality,did we risk?      An earlier Government had beew.
prepared to negotiate an agreement with Zaghloul had the &apos;latter shown himself in any way roasonable, which was not the c&amp;30.    His Majestyls Government, at that time, based their interests.) in the matter of imperial communications, on tho Suoz Canal only.     He himself had not only done this, but had also insisted on the maintenance of our communications through Egypt to the Sudan.   He felt quite certain that if another Government were to take office   before the expiration of the ten years envisaged in the treaty, they would be prepared to make large concessions to Egypt on this point, the more so if wo failed to reach, agreement now.   Under tho draft treaty we at least preserved the status quo for ten years, at the end of which it could be modified only as a result of a decision by the Council of the league.     Again, we must remember how the issue would present itself to tho Council of the league.      It must be borne in mind that insecurity of conditions in Egypt would affect foreigners equally with ourselves.    Unless, therefore, there was something in the nature cf a hostile coalition against us in Europe, foreign interests and ours would be the same and wo should have little difficulty, in those circumstances, in making out a case that would carry the league with us.-   At the same time, he fully believed Gary/at when he had emphasised to him the capital importance, from the point of view of getting the treaty accepted in Egypt, of the Article as it now steed, and he begged the Committee to accept it,SIR &quot;.7IILI1M J0YIIS01T-HICKS wished to be clear that the league could only rule that our forces should be withdrawn from Cairo, and not from Egypt as a wholo.SIR A US TEH CH,vH31jRi;.I17 replied that this was tho case, and that th-3 treaty in fact recognised our right to stay somewhere in Egypt in perpetuity.    He added that the draft now before the Committee contained virtually all the safeguards embodied in the draft which had been approved by the Cabinet in July last, except for a limitation on the numbers of the4,
Egyptian army, and any reference to the Sudan.   Ho had made it clear to Sarwat thst ho could not accept a return to the status quo ante 1924 in the Sudan, hut that the condominium would be maintained and the Egyptian flag would continue to fly in the Sudan so lor.5 as the Egyptian Government maintained its annual contribution.    If this contribution ceased,  it would be regarded as a termination by Egypt of tho condominium In these circumstances, .Sarwat Pasha preferred to omit all reference to the Sudan in the treaty question.    V/ith regard to the allocation of the Nils waters, a draft document had.been drawn up in consultation with the High Commissioner and the authorities of the Sudan, and given to Sarv/at Pasha who hi-s expressed himself as satisfied with it, subject to the advice of his exports.SIR DOUGLAS HOGG- understood that the decisions of the Council of the leaguo must bo unanimous,    He enquired what the procedure would be in the ca.se of an appeal by Egypt in tho matter of the allocation of our troops,,SIR AUSTEN CE--:JISERL,MI&quot; replied that.the decisions of the League had to be unanimous,    In the case in question, Eg:ypt would be called to the Council, but neither she nor Great Britain would vote.SIR LAMIIIG &quot;SORTEHiGTON-EVANS considered some of the changes made from the last draft were of a serious nature. He fully rocognisod the importance, from the political point of view., of hcving the occupation of Egypt by the British army recognised, but he wished to lay stress on several points0 With regard to the limitation of the Egyptian army, the position was that we hald Egypt by force, and we naturally wished to avoid the establishment of any counter-force, A safegiiard on this point had now disappeared from the draft treaty.    In the matter of British officers attached to the Egyptian army, tho reference to the notes exchanged las&apos;t\
Illsummer had also been omitted from the present draft.A further omission was Egypt&apos;s undertaking to obtain her armament only from this country.     Again ho was very doubtful as to the effect of the provision relating  to the barracks, etc., which we now occupy.   As it stood, the draft appoarod to imply that oven if we \v9r0 authorised by the League to stay in Egypt beyond a period of ton years, for this further period, we should have to pay for the accommodation of the troops which mi:-.ht involve the expenditure of some  5,000,000.Einally, he wished to emphasise thet Lord Allenby alone, he thought, among the military authorities consulted, had considered That the Suez Canal could properly be defended by troops stationed on the Canal itself.    If, therefore:tho retention of Cairo was in ft.ct essential, the issue raised in ten . ears time would not really be tho location of our troops in Egypt, but their presence there at all.Iloreover, the idea of constantly renewed arbitration contained in this i.rticle, implied constantly renewed friction.SIR WILLIAM JOYiJSOI?-E.C;:s fully agroea with what Sir L. Wbrthington-Ev&amp;ns had said on the subject of the barracks.    He thought that we should certainly endeavour to obtain the required extension of time if necessiry as in the previous draft.SI:: AUSTEN CHA;.:3ERLaIN observed that the present draft did not in fact differ in effect fror. the earlier draft in the matter of the barracks.    As to the officers with the Egyptian array, there- appeared to be a slight misunderstanding.    The officers were actually there, ur.der the exchange of notes last summer.    The words &quot;existing scale&quot; in the text thus actually prolonged
their own, cr their sucoessere tenure for the period oi ten years. &quot;.       Without the treaty on the otherhand their prouent contracts would expires in two years. V/e thus gained 5 total of eight years.-    It wes true that no reference wes code to the notes of last sunder, but Sarwat had insisted thst ouch a reference would Bsiks matters extremely difficult for him.      Further, it was necessary that wo should place s?me reliance on the improved relationc which would follow the signature 01 a treaty;    a consideration which also applied in the matter of armament.    tfe were bound to tslo a certain slight risk.    If we did not.  an unfortunate situation would result which would certainl land us in difficulties, and probably a scries of repressive measures -involving the use of force which would destroy any prospects of any growth of better feeling.    He could not agree that to tci.o the troops from Cairo was equivalent to taking them out of Egypt. Ten years misfire produce a great improvement in communications,  the building ox roads and so on, which would make it. an easy matter to reach Cairo quickly.    If in such circumstances the Egyptians were to cut the Sweet-(7ater Canal it v/ould be an act of war with which we should be forced to deal as such.MR- WIHS50B&apos; CHURCHILL asked what would be the pos.-i.ion in respect of the League, under the Treaty in iha case of s;eh an act.SIR AUSTSU OHAMBSRLAIfi replied that the position would be as it is at present.LORD BALL&apos;OUR enquired whether the provision respecting the quinquennial appeal to the League was unilateral only, and in favour of Egypt..    Ha considered
thet it should be bi-lateral.,SIR WILLIAM J0YK3O3-HICZ3 wished again to call attention to the unfortunate position we might find ourselves in at tho end of ton years in tho matter of the barracks.disclosure aUSTEII CHAM33RLAI1T considered that if such a situation arose, wo could properly refuse to pay and that the League would back us in our refusal,3IR tflLLIAL. J0YH30U-HICKS nevertheless thought that we should try to obtain this small modification, and pointed out that as compared with thet envisaged in the last draft a new situation had arisen.313 AUSTEH CE&amp;MBsHLAlK pointed out that he had handed our last draft to Sarvvat and that it was in consequence       a little difficult to go back on it, but ho would nevertheless make the attempt, as 3U&quot;?ested by Sir W.  Joynson-Eicks-SIR LOGGLAS HOGG thought that the HoTre Secretary was mistaken in thinking that our position under the late draft &apos;,vas hotter than under the pnesent one. He asrr :-ed   with Sir A, Chambexv-ain in thinking that ws could properly refuse to pay end  that we should be supported, by tho League.MR.  vVIHSTON CHURCHILL considered  that the treaty must bo read as a whole, and thit if Sarwat could introduce modifications into it,  so could we.    Further, ho wished to draw serious attention to the remarks of the Sooratary of State for   ,ar.    Cairo was the centre &quot; of our position in Ej/ypt, and many efforts had boon made in the pest to bring abo\it the removal of our troops from U.     Under the present draft, the
Egyptian army could be increas-.3d w    Their numbers might in foot be doubled and there seemed to be nothing to prersut them from equipping themselves with all mod rn weapons.    Tho bulk of theso increased forces would doubtless be cojjeentra ted in the neighbour hoed of Cairo, perhaps in such a way as virtually to cnr?.&apos;ound our own troops..    This would alter the balance of power,  and would necessitate an inorease in our own forces and thus more expense -   Moreover,  if the Egyptia army ware increased, the number of British officers would merely remain the same, and they would thus exox*ciS6 proportionately leoc influence *    He feared that we risked incubating a struggle which would end in blood.    Our only safeguard would be the League of Nations,  and we should have to rely upon persuading Italy, for instance, to back us at Geneva.    Egyptians would quickly realise this., and the League would be discredited in their eyes as an impartial arbiter-Ten ysai^s.  he pointed out, was no long period.    -During this time Egypt was free to raise what forces she could and meanwhile corruption was actually spreading in the Egyptian administration; while a wealthy class of pasha were- intent only on their own interests.    The result would be that the people would suffer.    .vs should inevitably have to bear a shrre cf the blame, but we should lack the corresponding power to put things right,.   The position woul&quot;- be a most unfavourable one. In conclusion he wished to ask what decision was the Committee to take.   He had referred before, in very strong terms, to the daaial to the Cabinet of
it3 right to pronounce upon the policy of 1922,     In the presont case, the Secretary of State for War, he must point aut.\, had soon the papers now ceforo them for the first time this afternoon and ho regarded this as undue precipitancy.     The War Offloe and the other Fighting Departments must, he thought, he given time to pronounce their opinions which were essential in view of the gravity of the issues involved.SIR WILLIAM JOYNSON-HICICS wished to call attention to Article 4 whioh dealt with, the protection of foreigners, one of the points reserved under the Declaration of February 1922,     This article did not appear to him to be as strong a*s the corresponding article of the previous draftaSIR AUSTEN Chamberlain&quot;-.RLAIN was satisfied that it was adequate.SIR LAMING W0RTHINGTGN-.E7ANS wished to make fourconcrete proposalss &quot;(1) that some limitation of the Egyptian ar-r-y should bo provided for;(2) that a stipulation should be added to Annex 1 (o) providing that the Egyptian rs^my sh.ou.lrl obtain their armament from Great Britain onlyj(3) that the last sentence of Annex 1 (a) should read:3e.....i at the disposal of the said forces3 free sof charge, tixo land and buildings required by &quot;them&quot; 5(4) that the Egyptian Government should bear some share of the cost of the army of occupation,,SIR AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN remarked, with regard to the fourth point, that, he really folt unable to re-open this matter at this stage.MR. WINSTON CHURCHILL invited the CommitteeTsattention to a Cabinet decision of November, 1926. in whiohLord Lloyd was instructed, generally speaking, to maintain our position in Egypt absolutely intact.     The presenttreaty did not seem to him to be in accord with this decision,in which, it was to bo observed, Sir A. Chamberlain had fullyconcurred.     Ee was not clear ns to how the position had-10-
changed in the meanwhile,     Sarwat Fasha had come to this country, tut admittedly his own political position was uncertain, and ho might well fall to carry through a treaty.     Nevertheless, we seemed to he prepared to recede from the position taken up in tho Cabinet decision he- had just referred to.LORD BIRKENKSAD pointed out that the argument as to the weakness of Sarwat &apos;s position was not precisely relevant. If Sarwat could not got it through, there woiild be no treaty0SIR AUSTEN CHAMBER LAIN pointed out that circumstances vsere new very different from those of a year ago.     At the time of the decision referred to, there had been no prospect of an. agreement, and our policy had ueen laid down accordingly. Eut now we had a chance of getting the security that wao necessary to us on the lines of friendly co-operation,  and such a chance might net occur again.      If we did not take it, he regarded trouble as certain.     He was even apprehensive of the result of failing to arrive at a treaty.      Such a failure could only make prospects worse,He believed that he could succeed in getting the quinquennial appeal to the League made mutual as between Egypt and Great Britain, and he thought It likely that he could obtain the Secretary of State for War &apos;s point in the matter of the barrai &quot;.:s, but he could not obtain a subsidy and he was doubtful whether he could induce Egypt to undertake to obtain armaments only from this country.     He had already tried-SIR LAMING WORTHINGTON-EVANS wished to emphasise the importance of this last point.     At present, we were for practieal purposes in a position to prevent increases in armament,,SIR AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN pointed out that we had no right to do so, other than force, and that we must now decide whether we were to treat Egypt as an ally or as a
potential enemy. He was most apprehensive of the effect upon public opinion in this country of the latter course.MR. rINSTON CHURCHILL thought that a refusal by Egypt to limit armaments would furnish a case on which ho would be quite prepared to face the House of Commons.LORD CUSHSNDUM again emphasised that we had no right, other than force, to check Egyptian armaments,kR. WINSTON CHURCHILL feared that Egypt might make an appeal to the League on this point.SIR aUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN thought that the League was unlikely to prove accommodating in the matter of granting increases in armament,LORD CUSHENDUN was of opinion that the treaty as a whole did not derogate from our position as Indicated by the Cabinet decision of November, 1926, but merely substituted treaty rights for force.SIR WILLIAM JOYNSCN-HICKS thought that the late Government&apos;s attitude towards Egypt was not unsatisfactory,. They had contemplated the protection of minoritiescSIR AUSTEN CHAMBER LAIN observed that this matter had already been argued In the Cabinet.   The only important minority in Egypt were the Copts, who appeared to be in no present need of our assistance, and had indeed made themselves conspicuous by their hnijbirity towards us.LOciD BALE OUR said that the situation, as he saw it, was very simple.      In 1922, we declared Egypt largely independent, but we had since used the four reserved points to diminish this independence.      It was unfortunate that we should appear to have taken up such a position before the world in general, and the British Empire in particular.     He would like to see some of the Secretary of S^ate for War&apos;s points taken up, but he considered that the Committee must determine whether we stood to ^lose anything by\he treaty as1
a whole.     Ke regarded it as a reasonable compromise.LORD 3IRKEiffiBAD was glad to hear that an immediat decision was not to be called for.     V/ith regard to the point made by Lord Balfour, it was true that we had recognised the independence of Egypt, but to do so amounted to insincerity, since the four reserved points were really in conflict with this independence.     He was much impressed by what Sir A. Chamberlain had said, and considered that, subject to one or two modifications in the draft, he had made out his case.     With regard to Sir L. Worthington-Evans1 two points, he wondered whether Sarwat Pasha would really refuse any limitation of the Egyptian army, for example, as to conscription.     The Egyptian army was hopelessly inefficient, but still he woul like to see some limit placed upon it, and also upon the amount of its armament.      That this armament should only be purchased in Grant Britain seemed to him a reasonable and friendly concession on EgyptTs part.MR. BRIDGEIIAN agreed with Lord Birkenhead.L03D BALEOUE hoped that- we should not base our demand that Egypt should purchase armaments in this country only on the interests of our trade.SIR AU3TE3 CEALIBEELAIII said that he Lad already pressed Sarwat hard upon this point, and cone his best to get   him to accept it.     But we hud, unfortunately, in the past treated Egypt very inconsistently in the matter.     The late Sir Lee Stack had wanted the Egyptian army to have a certain number of machine guns, but their supply was subsequently held up.SIR LAM DIG WORTHISGTOH-EVANS agreed that this was so, and added that it had been done deliberately in the interests of our own troops.     He added that the foreign Office had concurrod at the time.
SIT; AUSTEN CK&amp;iEEfiLAIH observed, with regard to the limitation of the Egyptian army, that under the old Turkish regime there h-;d been a limit of some 18,000, but thia limit we had subsequently withdrawn.     Sarwat Pasha had pointed this out to him with great force.SIR SuMUlO W3H2HINGT0H-EVAI/S observed that tho 12,000 odd limit represented an army of greater strength than the Egyptiens had ever had before.SIR AU3TEH OH5113ERLAIR agreed, but pointed out that the present conceptrotion in TSgypt was mainly due to the withdrawal of Egyptian units from the Sudan, in which latter country they were considerably more dangerous than where they are now.     Ee enquired whether some provision for mutual limitation of forces would be.acceptable to the Committee.SIR LJMIUO Y/OETHINGTOS-EVANS agreed to this, but considered that it would be desirable to make some stipulation as to the limit of armament as well as numbers.MR. WISSTOfl CHURCHILL agreed.LORD BIRKSiiHEAD also agreed,  out doubted the feasibility of any affective limitation upon armaments.SIR DOUGLAS HOGG regarded the present draft treaty, even precisely as? it 3tocd, as a very great advance, and he would not risk losing the treaty even for the sake of obtaining some limitation of the Egyptian army.     Ee called attention to the views expressed by Sir R. Lindsay and Mr. Henderson,     Further, if all the facus became public, and we appeared to have rejected the treaty as now drafted, the effect in the country would be most unfortunate.LORD LI.CTD pointed oat that, with regard to machine guns ordered in. this c..rut y and subsequently held up, when the order wfcs given we had been in full control of the Egyptian aimy and that with a diminution of this control., it seemed necessary to withhold the supply of guns.     With regard
to the troaty generally, he considered thax the provision for the exclusion of foreigners in Article 8 was i-n excellent one.j 2 (J With regard to Annex 1(a), he pointed out that tho wording, as it now stood, night result in course of tina in leaving the Inspector-General in a minority of one on a re-organised Egyptian Army Council.      This could be prevented by the insertion of the words &quot;present functions&quot; in the Article in question.     He further suggested that the words &quot;in Egy^t&quot; should be insertad after &quot;British Empire&quot; in line 4 of Article 7.SIR AU3EE1: CH At,; EE EE A IN considered that the effect of this last suggestion would be limitative rather than other-wise .oIE DOUGLAS EOGG agreed.SIE WII-LIA1.-I JOYl-ISOlMl ICES enquired, with regard to Annex 1(a), what would he the position at the end ox ten years,SIE AUCTE2J CEAE3EEEAIE considered that some further agreement would then be necessary.LORD LLOYD called attention to Annex II  (a),  and suggested that it should be laid down that the Financial Adviser should bo kept informed as to matters of administra-tion affecting foreigners.      The financial Advisor, he pointed cut, was, with himself, the guardian of the interests of the numerous foreign officials in the Egyptian service, but as the clause now stood, he would find his task difficult.     With regard to Annex Il(c), he observed that the European depart-ment, reference to which had been made in the last draft, was a valuable safeguard against the spread of Bolshevism in Egypt, which, he pointed out,  offered a very fertile soil for communist propaganda, owing to its highly unequal division of wealth.     Ho would like therefore to see some definite provision made for the maintenance of tho European Depsrt-ment rather than that this should be connected with agree-monts as to capitulavtory reform.     With regard to the Prime Minister&apos;e question us to his opinion of the effect of a failure to reach a treaty, ho would begin by saying that- 15 -
ho regarded the Declaration of 1922 as a thoroughly unsatisfactory instrument and that he would be glad to see a treaty substituted for it .     Ho disliked, however, the provision relative to the League of Nations.     T;ith regard to the result of a failure to reach agreement, it was quite impossible to attempt any accurate forecast, but ho thought that it should be possible to continue the present policy of treating the Egyptians with firmness, but with complete justice, under the Declaration:.     For obvious reasons he vcas apprehensive of an increase in the size of the Egyptian army;    but he did not wish to express an opinion as to the highly technical question of armament.,     General Raking, he observed, had been reluctant to see an increase in the number cf nr/ichine guns in the Egyptian army,  and he thought it certain that the present G.0..Co, Sir P.Strickland, would take the same viewu      He was loss apprehensive as to small increases in the strength of the Egyptian army, but he considered that tho question of arrnamenta presented real danger.     It \.ould be very difficult to restrict f;rw*raant, moreover,  if we were to ensure good feeling.THE PRIME . 1 SISTER enquired whether the improved senti-ment which should result from the treaty would not Ins-sen these risks.LORD. LLOYD considered that the max*gin of strength of our own army of occupation must be such as tc ensure its effectiveness in the l*st resort,  Irrespective cf the sentiment of this moment,SIR AUSTEN CHAitB -:ELAIN said ha was in disagreement with the views expressed by Lord Lloyd, He observed that tho Financial Adviser1s position was very different from that of the Judioic-1 Adviser, and that similar wording was therefore inapplicable. He was adviciad that the text as it stood was adequate from our point of view.     The European Department
vjes maintained by the present clause.
