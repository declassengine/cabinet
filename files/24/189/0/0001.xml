[This Document is I he Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.&apos;]Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1927.confidential cp. 251 (27).CHINA.THE Secretary of State for War undertook to place at the disposal of the Cabinet an interesting report made by Lord Gort to the War Office of his impressions of the Chinese situation. There reached me almost simultaneously this account of Mr. Lyall&apos;s views, which are equally interesting and the fruit, of course, of a much longer experience.   The Cabinet may be glad to see them.Mr. Lyall has for many years been recognised as perhaps the ablest man in the Chinese Customs Service. But for ill-health he might have succeeded Sir Robert Hart as Inspector-General (instead of Sir F. Aglen), and it is believed that it was arranged that he should succeed Sir F. Aglen had the latter decided not to return to China after the death of Lady Aglen in 1922. He was for many years Chinese Secretary in Peking (the post in the Customs corresponding to Chinese Secretary at His Majesty&apos;s Legation), and retired from the Customs in 1926, after filling for some years the highest post in the Service, that of Commissioner at Shanghai.THE following are notes of a conversation with Mr. Lyali, who, after some thirty years&apos; residence in China, has just retired from the post of Customs Commissioner at Shanghai.Discussing the situation at Shanghai, Mr. Lyall expressed appreciation of the despatch of the Shanghai Defence Force, whose presence had, he was sure, prevented the possibility of serious trouble in that city. Shanghai was, however, when he left it last June, in a perfectly normal state; the reports of undercurrents of dangerous movements and fears of attack from outside were, in his opinion, grotesque. There are still Communist agitators who maintain considerable activity there, and there is always the riff-raff to be taken into account, but there were the Shanghai police, an excellent force, as well as the Volunteers, who were perfectly capable of coping with trouble of this kind, and who could at any moment be reinforced by marines from the numerous foreign war-ships stationed in the harbour. He could see no reason for the continued maintenance of troops in the city so far as the local situation was concerned.He agreed that the withdrawal of these troops was a difficult problem. But he did not believe that their withdrawal would really be regarded by the Chinese as a sign of weakness so much as a sign of confidence and goodwill on our part.As to any idea of organised Chinese armies ever attacking the International Settlement at Shanghai (unless, possibly, in times when an actual state of war with foreign Powers had arisen), Mr. Lyail thought this absurd; it would amount to a declaration of war against all Powers having interests there, and would bring the Chinese armies under the very guns of the foreign navies.In reply to an enquiry as to his views on the creation of a Greater Shanghai, Mr. Lyall said that he could not see what necessity there was for such a measure. It was argued in its favour that Shanghai International Settlement had a restricted river frontage, and if it had more wharfage it could be developed into an even more magnificent port than it is now; also, that at present it can only extend westwards, where new residential quarters are growing up; but it is cramped north and south by the Chinese city and Chinese suburb of Chapei respectively.     ExtensionA. C.October 24, 1927.[F 7766/25/10][16709]B
northwards to Woosung would not only secure important additional river frontage but give outlet to the expansion of the city itself in new directions.Mr. Lyall could not, however, himself see the necessity for any such extension; as regards the river frontage, he pointed out that about half the wharves of the present port are outside the International Settlement, and there was no need whatever to create a Greater Shanghai for this purpose. Mr. Lyall himself resided outside the International Settlement, and would do so again if he went out there again.He considered the whole question of the importance of Shanghai as greatly exaggerated. It was, moreover, unfortunate that in view of the British nationality of a number of the higher police officials, the administration of the International Settlement should be generally regarded as a British responsibility. It Avas true that it was foreign help and protection which had enabled the Chinese to develop Shanghai into the prosperous and magnificent city which it is, but it was, in his opinion, quite wrong that this foreign administration should harbour and protect Chinese citizens from their own Government, and it was a very legitimate Chinese grievance that while the wealthiest as well as the most rascally Chinese live within the Settlement, there is no power of the Chinese authorities either to tax or to punish them for misdeeds while they remain there. In his view our policy for Shanghai should be to place it gradually more and more under joint Chinese and foreign, and eventually Chinese, control; and that meanwhile, as soon as possible, we ought to give the Chinese authorities full power to tax, arrest and generally deal with all Chinese residents in the Settlement.Mr. Lyall rather discounted the theory that Shanghai depends solely on the interior for its prosperity. This theory has been advanced to us as an argument for the reoccupation of Hankow. He says that while it is of course the great distributing centre for the interior, it depends for much of its prosperity as much on the very rich provinces in the hinterland as on the Yangtse trade.Mr. Lyall considers the maintenance of our extraterritorial rights is a much more-serious problem than that of Shanghai. These must undoubtedly be given up in course of time; other nationals avIio have been deprived of their special rights in China manage to live and even thrive without them. What he regards as most vital for our future trading prosperity in China in general is that we should give up our specially privileged position and obtain instead real assurance that British subjects will be as free tq/live and trade unmolested anywhere in the interior of China as all Chinese are in this country.Foreign Office, September 24, 1927.[F 6534/630/10] (2.)Mr. Lyall to Inspector-General of Customs.Sir, Shanghai, May 28, 1927.ON leaving the customs service, I feel it my duty to give expression to the fears that have been aroused in many members of the service by the policy adopted by the Inspectorate in revenue matters.I believe that to preserve the service it will be necessary for the Inspector-General to give up his control of the revenue. Sir Robert Harfs system of leaving the banking and disposal of the revenue entirely in the hands of the superintendents of customs should be resumed as soon as possible. It is unlikely that the foreign Powers would agree at the present moment to a complete return to the old system. The repayment of the foreign loans and indemnities will have to be left for the time being in the hands of the Inspector-General. But those foreign liabilities no longer absorb half the revenue. The foreign Powers have no right to decide what is to be done with the other half. If it were handed over to the superintendents daily, they could not object. The advantage of handing it over daily, instead of weekly or monthly, would be that in this way it would be easiest to decide which the superintendent is to whom the money ought to be paid. The calculation of the percentage of the revenue to be handed over to the superintendent would present
Internal Loans made by the Peking Government under the Inspector-General&apos;s Guarantee during the Years 1914-24.Dollars. 24,926,110 25,829,965 2,800,0001914, 3rd Year Loan 1915, 4th Year Loan 1915, 4th Year Loan, extra bonds 1916, 5th Year Loan (20 million dollars dollars)1918, 7th Year Loan, short term 1922, 11th Year Loan, short term 1923, Loan for Legations abroad 1923, Loan for Peking education 1924, 13th Year Treasury notesTotal    ...-7,770,51512,229,485 48,000,000 10,000,000 5,000,000 1,000,000 3,948,000133,733,560During these same years, 1914-24, the Inspector-General made the following payments from the revenue on account of internal loans : 1914-1819191920192019211921192219231924Haikwan Taels. Nil. 4,795,990 4,723,469 1,034,38010,280,729 2,316.59610,881,263 9,431,61014,662,30858,126,345At 100 Haikwan taels   153 Shanghai taels = 88,953,307 dollars.It therefore seems that if the Inspector-General had not assisted in the flotation of any internal loans, and after he had paid from the customs revenue the foreign debts and other authorised disbursements, he had remitted the remainder of the revenue to the Peking Government, that Government would have received during the years 1914-24 some 44 million dollars less than it actually did receive. But as the loans made by the Peking Government were not issued at par. the ready money borrowed by the Government did not really amount to as much as 133 million dollars, and the actual surplus received was less than 44 million dollars.On the other hand, the loss to China through the policy adopted by the Inspector-General was much greater than is given above; for interest at 6 per cent, or more has, or had, to be paid for a number of years on the above loans. And in addition to the above loans made under the Inspector-General&apos;s guarantee, the Inspector-General has undertaken to repay from revenue the capital and interest of the[16709] b 2no difficulty. It could be provisionally fixed at the beginning of the year, and revised each month in accordance with the actual amounts of revenue collected.Under the present system, although China is engaged in civil war, the whole customs revenue is remitted to the Inspector-General&apos;s account at Shanghai, and the Inspector-General pays from this account the foreign loans and indemnities secured on the revenue. After these sums have been paid, if the Inspector-General were to hand over the remainder of the revenue to the Peking Government to use it as they think fit, the provinces at war with Peking would have some cause for complaint. But, if that were done, Peking would only be able to use for its own purposes the current year&apos;s revenue; and what has actually happened is worse than this. For the Inspector-General, by giving his guarantee for the repayment of internal loans secured on the revenue, has enabled the Peking Government to use for its own purposes not only the current year&apos;s revenue, but also the revenue that will be collected by the Customs throughout China for some years to come.The account, as far as I have been able to make out, stands as follows : 
following loans made by the Peking Government without the assistance of the Inspector-General: Dollars.1916, 5th year, short term       ... ... ...       7,700,515Consolidated Debt (202,010,168 dollars-11,359,610dollars) ... ... ... ...     190,650,558198,351,073The result to China of the policy adopted by the Inspector-General has therefore been that the Peking Government, instead of merely dissipating the current customs revenue for the years 1914-24, have, in addition, saddled the future customs revenue with a capital debt of 242 million dollars in all, which with interest will amount to a very much larger sum.The vast majority of the money borrowed has not been spent on any useful object. Much of it has been wasted, and much more has been spent on armaments which have been employed in civil war generally and in attempting to conquer South China in particular.The guaranteeing of these loans by the Inspector-General has naturally earned for the customs service the hatred of South China.Most of the loans made by the Chinese Government on its own account, without the help of the Inspector-General, were contracted on very improvident terms. The leaders could never have expected to get their money repaid in full. Before the Inspector-General undertook to repay them, the loan bonds were quoted on the market at a very low figure. Holders would probably have been only too happy to receive a guarantee that the bonds would be repaid at half their face Value. By undertaking to repay them at par the Inspector-General has put large sums of money into the pockets of speculators, and has saddled China with a much bigger debt than seems reasonable; besides inflicting on South China the injustice of making her repay loans mostly spent in levying war upon her. By placing the control of the revenue in the hands of the Commissioners of Customs, the position of the commissioner vis-a-vis his superintendent has been rendered very difficult. The Customs have many interests. We are the harbour authority, we are concerned with inland navigation and native customs questions, and we are large landowners. In all these matters, questions constantly crop up for which the support of the superintendent is indispensable. A man with a grievance does not give his support readily. And as long as the commissioner usurps from the superintendent the control of the revenue to which the superintendent believes himself entitled, it is not to be expected that he will receive from the superintendent any whole-hearted support.The present anti-foreign feeling running through China is perhaps more widely spread than such exhibitions of feeling have been in the past, but it is not different from those that have gone before. The attitude adopted by the local authorities towards the customs seems, on the other hand, to be quite different from what it was in the past. In the past the local authorities always did their best to protect the customs. They now seem generally to display ill-will towards the service. The reason is evident. In the past a great part of the revenue that passed through the hands of the local officials was collected by the Customs. It was therefore to their interest to protect us. To-day they have nothing to gain by protecting the customs, and the service having become hateful to them, owing to the support it has given to their enemies the Northern militarists, they naturally take a pleasure in seeing it humiliated. It is possible that the assistance we are now giving the local authorities in the collection of the surtax may improve this state of affairs. But as the revenue collected at most of the ports in the interior, where the danger to the service is greatest, is almost entirely export and coast-trade duties, it is not to be expected that any great improvement will result.Though the Inspector-General has done his utmost to prevent current revenue being used for the selfish purposes of the Peking Government, considerable sums have been diverted from time to time to the use of that Government. And the endless bickerings between the Inspector-General and the Peking officials over these money questions have done the service a great deal of harm. The Inspector-General has also been placed in a false position. One man cannot be master and servant at the same time. By his control of the purse-strings, Sir Francis Aglen had become the master of the Government, whose servant he professed to be.  It is not to be wondered
at that the position became intolerable to the Peking Government, and that it ended in his dismissal.It cannot, I think, be denied that all the above disadvantages have resulted to the customs service from the assumption of the control of the revenue by the Inspector-General. The two chief arguments I have heard advanced in defence of the action of the Inspectorate are 1. That it has improved China&apos;s credit.2. That it has secured for the Customs the support of the Chinese bankers and merchants, through the guarantee that has been provided for the repay-ment of internal loans.It is certainly true that the action of the Inspector-General improved the credit of the Peking Government. But as this Government has, for a number of years, been undeserving of any credit, and has used its credit merely to enrich its friends and promote civil war, the improvement of its credit has not been a benefit to China.That the support of the Chinese financial world is of no real value to the customs service was shown on the occasion of the. dismissal of Sir Francis Aglen.I know well the difficulty of the position in which the Inspector-General has been placed by the civil war in China. Neither is there any likelihood of the position becoming easier for years to come. But it must be remembered that Sir Robert Hart built up the service on the principle that commissioners should have nothing to do with the handling of the revenue. His unparalleled insight into things Chinese enabled him to foresee, that any other course was bound to lead to grave friction. And if it was advisable for us not to touch the revenue in Sir Robert Harfs days, when China was a united Empire, it is far more so now that she is split up into hostile camps.I do not underestimate the difficulties and dangers of a change of policy. Yet I venture to submit that they must be faced. It is very unlikely that the civil war will come to an end shortly. But if it is to do so, it can now safely be said that this can only happen in one of two ways. Either the country will be. divided for the time being into two or more units, or else it will be united under the Young China party. If the war is to continue, it is essential that the customs service shall really place itself in a neutral position between the contending parties. So far it has failed to do so. And it seems to me that the only way it can be done is by handing over the control of the revenue to the local authorities. If the war is shortly to end in the partial or complete triumph of the Young China party, the sooner the service enters into friendly relations with that party the better.I am not proposing that anything should be done. I am only pointing out that the service has been placed in a false position, and that the sooner it gets out of it the better.The opportunity will come if the Southern Government again asks that the revenue collected in South China shall be handed over to it. After the foreign debt has been met from the revenue, the right of the Southern Government to the revenue collected in South China is incontestable. Neither the Inspector-General nor anybody else can hypothecate funds that do not belong to him. The demand ought, therefore, to be granted, and thus the control of the revenue will return automatically into the hands of the superintendent.If the position of the Inspector-General in Peking makes this solution of the question impossible, it would seem that the only alternative is to split the customs service into two. What is to be done about the internal loans is a question to be decided by the Chinese interested.I have, &amp;c.L. A. LYALL, Vice-Chairman of the Commission for the Compilation of Values.
