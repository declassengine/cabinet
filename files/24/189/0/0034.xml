PROPOSED PURCHASE OF PERSIAN OPIUM BY THE GOVERNMENTOF HONG KONG.Memorandum by the Acting Secretary of State for the Colonies.1. THE Cabinet are aware, from telegrams which have recently been circulated, that the Governor of Hong Kong is urgently anxious to be authorised to pui-chase Persian opium, without which an experiment which his Government has embarked upon (with the object of rescuing the Administration from an intolerable situation) is bound to fail.Very briefly the history is as follows: 2. Article 6 of The Hague Convention, 1912, requires the contracting parties &quot; to take measures for the gradual and effective suppression of the manufacture of, internal trade in, and use of prepared opium, with due regard to- the varying circumstances of each country concerned.&quot;3. Although the Convention did not come into force till 1920, the Hong Kong Government established a Government monopoly in 1914 and (in common with other Far Eastern Administrations British and foreign) adopted as one of the measures designed to give effect to their obligations under The Hague Conven-tion, the policy of discouraging consumption by progressively raising the retail price of the prepared opium sold by the Monopoly. In accordance with this policy the retail price of opium in Hong Kong was raised from $10 a tael in 1914 to $14*50 a tael in 1919, at which price (equivalent at present rates of exchange to roughly 22s. an ounce) it has remained ever since.4. It is clear that, if there were no danger of smuggling, and provided that real wages did not x-ise to an extent sufficient to nullify its effects, this policy of progressively increasing the price of Government opium must lead to the gradual suppression of opium smoking by all but wealthy men, and the problem of completing the process by bringing in total prohibition would ultimately have become comparatively simple. Indeed, actual experience showed that up to a point the policy was attended by a very considerable measure of success.5. Shortly after the end of the war, however, there were signs of a recrudescence of the cultivation of the poppy in China, which in theory had been completely suppressed in 1917. In an almost incredibly short space of time poppy fields again spread over practically the whole of China, and immense quantities of opium have been produced in China ever since, and are continuing to be produced to-day.6. With our teeming Chinese population in Hong Kong, denied Government opium except at licensed shops which are subject to stringent regulations, and at an almost prohibitive price, wholesale smuggling of opium into the Colony from China became inevitable. In fact Hong Kong is inundated with smuggled opium, in spite of the ceaseless war waged against the smugglers, illicit opium boilers and illicit divan keepers not to mention the actual smokers of illioit opium.7. It is common ground that, having regard to the geographical situation of Hong Kong, with its innumerable creeks and waterways, its harbour teeming with native craft, its large floating Chinese population constantly passing baokwards and forwards between the Colony and the mainland of China, it is physically impossible (granted the demand and the existence of tho supply both of whioh no [1(5832] &quot; b&quot; 21CONFIDENTIAL. Copy No.   30CP. 284 (27).CABINET.
one doubts or denies) for the preventive service to cope with the smuggling of opium into the Colony, so long as it remains so profitable an enterprise.8. As regards the consequences of this situation, I cannot do better than to quote the following paragraphs from a memorandum prepared by Mr. Amery in March last for consideration by a Cabinet Committee on Opium Policy : &quot; They (Le., responsible officials in the Colony) are also conscious of the insidious danger to the good government of their territories which is threatened by the almost inevitable growth of corruption among the staffs of the police and opium control departments, these staffs being necessarily recruited from various Asiatic races.&quot;Further, they feel much anxiety at the multiplication of punishable offences in connection with the repression of opium smoking. I can perhaps best illustrate this by giving the following quotation from the report of the Hong Kong Opium Committee, which was appointed in 1924: &apos; In 1923 the senior revenue officer alone captured 716 illicit divan keepers, 3,359 illicit opium smokers, 386 traffickers in illicit opium and 60 boilers of illicit opium.&apos;My colleagues will no doubt be surprised to hear that in the small Colony of Hong Kong, even in 1926, when the activities of the Government were fully occupied in other directions, there was a daily average of no fewer than 300 persons in gaol, convicted of offences against the opium laws.&quot; In short, even the present measures of control entail the crowding of the gaols, the banishment of numerous persons who are in no other way a danger to the Colony, the nourishment of a parasitic class of informers, the prevalence of blackmail, the corruption of Government servants and the evils attendant on the inevitable system of the payment of rewards to informers. Further measures of control or repression must necessarily entail the creation of more punisWble offences and more corruption. It is obvious that if this process is allowed to continue beyond a certain point the result will be disastrous to the prestige of Government. My own firm conviction is that this danger-point has almost, if not quite, been reached. With the facts mentioned in the last paragraph before them, I feel that my colleagues can hardly fail to share this view. Personally, I would go so far as to say that the evils arising from the repi-essive measures are much greater than the evils which the convention aims at repressing.&quot;9. Since that memorandum was written the situation has become even more serious. By the end of August illicit divan keepers (to refer to one class of offences only) were being convicted at the rate of 200 a month, and the daily average of opium offenders in gaol had risen to 540. In spite of the most conscientious activities of the police, I fear that the number of offenders considerably exceeds those caught and incarcerated.10. Another indication of the extent of the increase in smuggling in the past few years, as a result of the trade depression in the Colony and the anarchy prevailing in South China, is furnished by the fact that the sales of Government opium in 1926 were rather less than half the sales in 1924.11. In a despatch dated- the 6th October the Officer Administering the Government has written : &quot; The gaols are filled with artificial criminals who have committed no crime other than what is regarded by Chinese public opinion as the most venial of offences. The native police and preventive staff are open to the most serious temptations and it is impossible for the Government to hope to combat smuggling, far less to suppress consumption when its price for opium is $14.50 a tael, while a respectable brand of Chinese prepared opium can be purchased in Canton for $2 a tael, and Macao (Portuguese) aud Kwong Chan Wan opium can be obtained for $6 a tael.&quot;12. A representative local Committee which reviewed the opium situation in Hong Kong in 1924 estimated that at least as muoh illicit as licit opium was then smoked in the Colony and that some 20 to 25 per cent, of the adult Chinese
population either smoke or swallow opium. A Senior Revenue Officer who for the last six years has been employed solely on the suppression of divans (and who was recently securing convictions at the rate of about 200 a month) has estimated that the proportion of illicit to licit opium consumed has risen to 10 to 1 and that on an average 70 per cent, of the male adult population smoke opium to a greater or lesser degree.13. These figures are admittedly guesswork, but the fact that they are seriously put forward by experienced officials gives at any rate some indication of the state of affairs in the Colony.14. The Officer Administering the Government states that, faced with this situation, he decided after full consideration to place on the market, as an experiment, two brands of medium quality, one containing 33J per cent, of Indian opium at $8*33 a tael, and another brand made from confiscated (i.e., mainly Chinese) opium only at $6*66 a tael. The object of this move was to compete with certain definite brands of illicit opium with a view to driving smugglers off the market, or at any rate to considerably reduce the incentives to the consumption of smuggled opium.15. The prices were provisionally fixed at figures more or less equivalent to the prices of definite brands of smuggled opium after making due allowances for the fact that consumers would be prepared to paj&apos; a rather higher price for licit opium in order to escape the risk of prosecution. The prices are, however, subject to adjustment in the light of experience.16. In coming to the decision to embark on this experiment the Governor was actuated by two separate, though connected, considerations: (a.) The evils inseparable from a situation in which the greater part of the population is habitually breaking the law. I have already indicated some of these evils in paragraphs 8 and 11 above. There must clearly be a limit to the process of prosecution and conviction when this process, if carried to its logical conclusion, would involve the incarcera-tion of the majority of the population of the Colony. In the opinion of the Governor this limit had been reached. His solution amounts to an honest attempt to reduce the number of offences, and thus to relieve his Government of what had become an intolerable situation.(6.) The basis of the policy followed in the British Far Eastern Colonies since 1912 (and endorsed by the Geneva Conference-ence in 1924) is that the &quot;best means of establishing the control which is a necessary preliminary to the process of gradual reduction and eventual prohibition of opium smoking, is through the agency of a Government Monopoly. This policy was crystallised in the Geneva Agreement of 1925. The logical conclusion of this policy is that as much as possible of the traffic should be in the hands of the Government. This being the case, and repressive measures having produced not merely an impasse but the intolerable situation already discussed, the Governor felt that the only solution lay in an attempt to recapture the market which had been overwhelmed by the smugglers.17. This experiment is by no means an unheard-of departure. The Governor was aware that the Netherlands Government had reported to the League of Nations Opium Advisory Committee that similar action had been under consideration (if it has not actually been taken) by the Authorities in the Netherland East Indies, and we have recently learnt that the advisers of the Siamese Government are now also seriously considering a similar course.18. On the 7th October the Governor telegraphed that the immediate effect of the experiment had been to send up the sales of Government opium from 500 to 2,000 taels a day. and in order to meet this demand it would bo necessary to supplement the stocks of confiscated opium (which, as indicated above, formed the basis of the two cheaper brands) by buying Persian opium. Unless he can obtain supplies by December the experiment will have to be abandoned, as the stocks of confiscated opium will have been exhausted.19.   The matter has  been  under consideration  by the Standing Inter-Departmental Committee on Opium Polioy, and objections to the experiment [16832] &apos; B 2
have been urged on a variety of grounds, the chief of which may be summarised as follows: (a.) There is no guarantee that the experiment will succeed, since the smugglers will be able to recapture the market by lowering their prices.(6.) There are objections to introducing anymore opium, from any source, into any territory in the Far East, since there is already a practically unlimited supply there.(c.) We should be open to criticism at Geneva and in America if we bought Persian opium for this purpose, having regard to the efforts of the League of Nations to induce the Persian Government to reduce production.20. As regards (a), the answer is that the prices of the new Government brands will be adjusted in the light of experience. It is not expected that the whole of the field now supplied by the smugglers will be recaptured. What is looked for is a reduction of smuggling to less unreasonable proportions. In this connection it will be seen from the figures already quoted that the Government is now supplying about twice as much &quot; licit&quot; opium as was sold in 1924, i.e., the equivalent of the estimated total consumption (licit and illicit) in that year. This, I submit, is not unreasonable.21. As regards (6), the quantity of Persian opium for which the Governor asks would be as a drop in the ocean compared with the large quantities of opium already in the market in South China, and so could have little or no adverse effect on the general situation there. In any case I submit that the deciding factor in the minds of His Majesty&apos;s Government should be the welfare of our own Colony. In his recent despatch the Governor has written as follows: &quot; I would emphasise the fact that my action in putting cheaper Government brands on the market is not creating a demand or artificially maintaining one &quot; in other words, the intro-duction of Persian opium will drive out an equivalent quantity of illicit Chinese opium and will not increase the total quantity smoked.22. As regards (c), I desire to recall the fact that when the Government of India was considering the adoption of its policy of progressive reduction of exports of opium, Mr. Amery only refrained from pressing His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment to intervene on the understanding that our Far Eastern Colonies would be at liberty to go elsewhere for their reasonable requirements. In this connection I may point out that the Governments of the Straits Settlements, British North Borneo, the Netherland East Indies, Siam and Japan are already buying large quantities of Persian opium in order to make good deficiences in the supply of Indian opium. The sole reason why Hong Kong has not already had to enter the Persian market is that the consumption of Government opium has declined to such an extent during the past three years (as a result of the increase of smuggling which the present experiment is designed to combat) that even the restricted supplies of Indian opium have been adequate for its needs. Even apart from this experiment the Hong Kong Government would have had to buy from Persia as soon as the progressively declining supplies from India were inadequate for its needs : and in any case the quantity now asked for by Hong Kong is very small in comparison with the quantities already being bought by other Far Eastern administrations.For these reasons I submit that objection (e) is really academic.23. I ask my colleagues what is the alternative to approving the Governors proposal bearing in mind that something has to be done to relieve the Hong Kong Government in the present intolerable situation ?24. The only alternative proposal that has been put forward is that the Government should relax the stringency of its administrative campaign of detection and prosecution for offences against the opium laws.25. I submit that this proposal will hardly bear examination. I quote the following very pertinent remark in a recent telegram from the Governor : &quot; I assume that His Majesty&apos;s Government and the League of Nations ai*e anxious to deal with the facts of the situation and are concerned to see a
(note.-1 tael (tahil) = 1$ oz.; 1 cheat = 140 lbs.)olower total consumption of opium in Hong Kong rather than a mere reduction :t&apos;. in Government sales accompanied by an ever-increasing supply of smuggled opium.&quot;This observation by the Governor should be read in conjunction with Article 6 of The Hague Convention quoted in paragraph 1 of this memorandum.26. Apart from the moral question raised in the last paragraph I can hardly imagine that the Cabinet will require me to issue instructions to the Governor which would involve an implied admission that His Majesty&apos;s Government have so little regard for the good Government of a British Colony that they are content to relieve the pressure on the gaol accommodation of the Colony by throwing up the sponge and leaving the smugglers virtually free to break the laws with impunity.27. There is one further consideration which I wish to place before the Cabinet. As the Cabinet are aware, in Chinese minds great importance is attached to &quot; face.&quot; If the Hong Kong Government has, on instructions from home, to abandon a measure which it has put into operation after due considera-tion, its prestige will suffer very seriously at a time when for political reasons it is most important that it should be retained.28. To sum up : The situation resulting from the prevalence of opium smuggling and the efforts of the Hong Kong Government to suppress it had become intolerable, and it had become necessary to take steps to relieve the situation.As an experiment, the Governor has placed cheaper brands of Government opium on the market with a view to lessening the inducement to smoke smuggled opium. By lessening the number of opium offences this measure should afford the necessary relief to the Administration.Mox-eover, while the consumption of Government opium will, of course, be increased, not only will this not imply an increase in total consumption, but, on the other hand, will be in conformity with the tendency recognised internationally by the Geneva Opium Agreement of 1925 as the correct line of advance towards the control and ultimate suppression of opium smoking demanded by The Hague Convention.In order to maintain the experiment, it will be necessary for the Hong Kong Government to buy Persian opium, to which course certain objections have been raised which, in my view, are largely illusory or academic.I accordingly submit that the Hong Kong Government should be authorised to purchase Persian opium for this purpose.W. 0.-G.Colonial Office,November 18, 1927.
