This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.&quot;!32CONFIDENTIAL. g QCP. 256 (27).THE PRESENT SITUATION IN REGARD TO DISARMAMENT.Sir M. ITANKEY requested Mr. Cadogan to prepare for the information of the Cabinet Committee on Disarmament a paper that would give in outline the recent history of the question. I believe that Mr. Cadogan&apos;s memorandum will be most useful to the Committee in approaching the consideration of the problems referred to them; but as in some respects it does not quite represent my own views, I have thought that my office minute on it might also be of use to the &quot;Committee.A. C.October 27, 1927.The Geneva Protocol having been formally rejected at the meeting of the Council in March 1925, the Assembly in September of that year was rather at a loss what to do about security and disarmament. Locarno was in the air, but had not yet materialised, so that, as far as security was concerned, the Assembly could only give expression to a pious hope for the success of the policy of partial or regional agree-ments which had been suggested in the speech in which Sir A. Chamberlain had rejected the Protocol in March. With that it ought to have been content, but certain delegations wished it to go further and, before the first step had actually been taken towards security, insisted on making some provision for &quot; preparing &quot; the work of Disarmament which might perhaps be expected to follow the establishment of a degree of security not yet realised. We were assured which was, and remains, quite true  that it would be folly to go into a Disarmament Conference unless the ground had been fully prepared beforehand, and what was more open to doubt that it was not too early to begin. So the Assembly asked the Council to constitute the &apos;*&quot; Preparatory Committee for the Disarmament Conference,&quot; and the Council, as in duty bound, proceeded to do so in December 1925. It was formed of representatives of the States Members of the Council and, by special invitation, of the United States of America, Germany, Russia, Bulgaria, Finland, the Netherlands, Poland, Roumania, and the S.H.S. State. To these were added in March 1926 the Argentine and Chile. Subsequently, by their election to the Council in September, Colombia, Salvador and China were also admitted, and by the last elections we have now gained in addition the co-operation of Canada and Cuba. Finally, the inclusion of Greece was specially authorised by the last Council. The Council, moreover, set the Preparatory Committee a questionnaire, being a number of theoretical questions on the principles of disarmament, probably unanswerable by any ordinary body of men. Assuming that it was necessary to appoint prematurely a body to &quot; prepare &quot; a conference for which the world was not yet ready, there could probably have been devised no better means of keeping it occupied for an almost indefinite period. The Preparatory Committee met for the first time in May 1926, and tackled this questionnaire. The method Avhich it adopted not unwisely, in the circumstances  was to recast these questions in a rather more detailed form, and hand them on to sub-committees for study. Most of the questions certainly the most contentious of them were referred to Sub-Committee &quot; A&quot; a body closely resembling the&apos; Permanent Advisory Committee, in that it was formed of military, naval and air advisers of the Governments represented on the Preparatory Committee itself. So-called &quot; economic &quot; questions were referred to Sub-Committee &quot; B.&quot; It would be only confusing to enumerate the other off-shoots Joint Committees, Committees of Experts, &amp;c.Sub-Committee &quot; A &quot; dragged on throughout the summer. Seeing that it was composed of experts without power to negotiate, the positive results could not be expected to be great. On certain points there was agreement, and this fact was duly recorded. On others there was complete divergence, and no attempt was made to conceal the fact. So that on many points one found one group of States putting up Answer I. This would be followed in the report by Answer II, devised by 4170   [16730] b
2another group of States. (In order to avoid complication, I leave out of account cases where three or more answers were submitted.) Then would follow a chapter on the &quot; advantages &quot; of I, written by its adherents, who, if in combative mood, Avould also contribute some paragraphs headed li disadvantages &quot; of II. The adherents of II would certainly reply with &quot;disadvantages&quot; of I, and might, if they could think of them, add &quot; advantages &quot; of II. This, of course, had one good result, in that it elicited clear statements of the experts&apos; ideas of their own Governments views. But it had the drawback that it rather shocked the feelings of those Governments who thought that it was time that some dignified progress should be made with disarmament. So that when the Assembly met in 1926 the Locarno Treaties had been initialled in October 1925 and signed in December  there was a demand that the work should be got on with. We had made a stride towards security, and we must make a plunge in the direction of disarmament. So the Assembly asked the Council to hurry up the Preparatory Committee so that the Disarmament Conference might be summoned before the next Assembly, provided this were not materially impossible. This had all followed fairly logically, but, in effect, it was a breach with the policy to which the League had pledged itself in 1922, when it practically laid down the principle &quot; Disarmament through Security.&quot; We had got some measure of security in the Locarno Treaties not the general security of the Protocol and if the theory was correct, some measure of disarmament should follow automatically. The Locarno Treaties were signed in December 1925, but owing to the delay in Germany&apos;s entry into the League they were not yet in force. The League should have waited to see what would be the result. But, instead of that, it decreed a Disarmament &quot;Conference during 1927, if possible. This really amounted, in the circumstances, to an attempt to get &quot; Securitjr through Disarmament.&quot;Thus, when the Preparatory Committee met again in March 1927, everyone went there feeling that this time something really must be done.Lord Cecil felt that the technical questions had been sufficiently aired in the long discussions in Sub-Committee &quot; A.&quot; No advantage would be gained by further reiteration of conflicting views, and the time had come to try and combine those views into one acceptable scheme. He therefore proposed to submit to the Committee a draff convention designed, as far as possible, to unite the views of the various Governments. His draft convention -was revised by the C.I.D., and he went out to Geneva in March last with a version of it which His Majesty&apos;s Government would be prepared to accept.Briefly, this draft convention attempted to lay down the principles of reduction or limitation of armaments; it did not attempt to allot quotas to each country. For instance, as regards land effectives, it provided that each High Contracting Party should undertake that the number of these &quot; should not exceed that prescribed in Table I of Annex I.&quot; These &quot; tables &quot; were left blank, the idea being that it would be for the Disarmament Conference itself to fill in the figures. Similarly, as regards aircraft, &quot; the number of such aircraft maintained by each of the High Contracting Parties shall not exceed the figure set out in Table III of Annex I.&quot;There were several points on which we knew (from the discussions in Sub-Committee &quot; A &quot;) that other Governments notably the French and their adherents would not be disposed to accept our proposals.1. We proposed that the limitation of land effectives should apply in some measure to reserves as well as to the effectives aetualry serving with the colours.2. We insisted on the limitation of numbers as well as tonnage of warships in each of a. number of distinct classes, whereas the French would consider only a limitation of the total tonnage irrespective of class.3. His Majesty&apos;s Government were unable to accept the idea of a limitation of expenditure on armaments, though they were prepared to agree to a system of publicity.4. We were opposed to any idea of strict control or supervision to ensure the carrying out of the Treaty, whereas the French Government, at least, evidently contemplated a special organisation for this purpose.At the outset of the meeting of the Preparatory Committee, Lord Cecil tabled his draft convention. This at once elicited a counter-draft from the French, and a comparison of the two shoAved that the above Avere the main points of difference.
33The Committee decided to proceed to a discussion of the various headings seriatim, and under each heading to take the provisions of the two drafts and try to evolve a single text. It agreed to open the proceedings with a discussion of effectives. Lord Cecil put the case for a limitation of reserves as well as of effectives with the Colours, and received support from some delegations notably the Swedes and the Americans. But after long discussion, it became evident that a large majority of the Committee, headed by the French, who received the support of their usual followers, would have nothing to do with any limitation of the numbers of reserves. Lord Cecil, not wishing to reach a deadlockat this stage of the proceedings, and hoping, I think, that if we eventually gave way to the continental nations on land effectives they might let us have our way in naval matters, proposed to pass on to other questions, leaving this one open for the moment. His actual words were these : &quot; I have done my best and I have been a complete failure. I have not shaken even M. de Brouckere. whose open-mindedness we all know; I have not shaken M. Paul Boncour, who has treated me with such courtesy and consideration all through; and I have not shaken even my friend M. secretary, who has expressed, Avith his usual courtesy, his great regret for differing from me. There it is; that is the end of it. As we cannot get a unanimous view in favour of the opinion I put forward, it is no good persisting, as these things must be done by unanimous views in all matters. I regret the position my friends take, but I shall not persist, having regard to their attitude.&quot;The Committee accordingly passed on to the discussion of air armaments. But it may be observed here that the French misunderstood, or misrepresented. Lord Cecil to the extent that they are now inclined to emphasise that the Preparatory Committee broke down on the naval question alone, i.e., on our obstinate attitude in regard to that question, and that there was general agreement on land effectives. Lord Onslow challenged this view at a meeting of the Third Committee of the last Assembly, and I think the challenge ought to be maintained and that, when the Preparatory Committee meets again, we should, in the &quot;Second Reading,&quot; take the points again in the same order, i.e., effectives first, and fight the battle over again, to show that there are other Governments whose unreasonable attitude is an obstacle in the way of a satisfactory scheme of general disarmament.In regard to air armaments, something was achieved, there being unanimity in favour of limiting aircraft by number and horse-power.The Committee then tackled the naval question, and were unfortunately unable to arrive at an agreement except on minor points of detail, and it was agreed to pass on from this question, leaving the conflicting proposals to stand in parallel columns. It is true that the French Government produced a modification of their original proposals which appeared to go some way to meet the British view. On examination, however, it proved that this advance was more apparent than real. Anyhow, it was decided to leave the question alone for the moment, more especially as the Tripartite Naval Conference at Geneva was impending, and it was felt that if agreement could there be reached between the principal naval PoAvers, the rest might be ready to follow with a good grace. There for the moment Ave may leave the naval question, observing only that on this point there was a fundamental divergence of view on the very principle of limitation, in the same Avay that there had been a definite absence of agreement on the principles of the limitation of land armaments, though the difference on the naval question has been emphasised and exploited by the French, whereas Ave have not given prominence to Avhat Ave might rightly regard as an unreasonable attitude on their part in regard to land effectives.After the rather spectacular failure of the Preparatory Committee to produce any agreement on the naval question, interest in the Committee&apos;s proceedings waned. somewhat perfunctorily it continued to discuss limitation of expenditure and such subjects as &quot;Organisation,&quot; &quot;Exchange of Information,&quot; &quot;Derogations,&quot; and &quot;Procedure Avith regard to Complaints and Revision.&quot; Practically no agreement was reached on these points, but delegates Avere tired of arguing, and the Committee had acquired the habit of setting doAvn its results in two (or more) columns. I do not believe that these last-named points would present any insuperable difficulty. The tAvo difficulties are army reserves and the naval question.We are in a minority on both questions. In regard to military reserves, we certainly have a good case for demanding their reduction, but Ave are, of course, had advocates of that case in that we have no reserves, in the continental conscrip-tionalist sense, so that all our opponents can insinuate that it is easy for us to ask them to dispense with Avhat we haven&apos;t got. In regard to the naval question, we are, [16730] B 2
of course, in a minority, because we are in an unique position as regards sea-power. That might give us the right to lay clown the law to others on this question, but if this principle is admitted We must maintain silence in regard to reservists. It is, of course, unfortunate that the few big naval Powers cannot agree amongst themselves on the naval question. And this brings us to the Geneva Naval Conference, which, instead of facilitating the work of the Preparatory Committee, has made it infinitely more difficult. For, whereas at the Preparatory Committee in April it was not very evident that agreement between the United States and British Governments would be impossible or even difficult, and the dispute raged between the British and the French, the latter have since witnessed the Americans fighting their battle at the Geneva Conference and cannot but be encouraged in their opposition to our proposals. It is true that the American and French opposition is based on different policies and founded on different considerations, but it is equally determined in either case.When the Preparatory Committee adjourned at the end of April it was decided in principle that it should meet again in November in any case, in the course of the present year. It was hoped that direct discussions between Governments might afford hope of agreement on the points in dispute. Unfortunately, as has been seen, the outcome of the Geneva Conference rather dashed this hope, and at the moment no progress can be recorded.It was to be anticipated that the Assembly in September would take a lively interest in the question, and this proved to be the, case. Everyone agreed that the Preparatory Committee must meet as arranged at least, no one was prepared to suggest its postponement. The French were fully alive to the danger of embarking on another discussion unless some preliminary agreement had been reached before-hand on the difficult points, and they saw- in this deadlock an opportunity again of preaching &quot;Security.&quot; They maintained that the present difficult situation arose out of the mistake made in divorcing disarmament from security, on the inter-dependence of which they had always insisted, and they proposed that the Prepara-tory Committee should be instructed to examine the question of &quot; security,&quot; so as to give it something to do even though it might be able to effect nothing in the matter of disarmament. This at once brought them up against the German delegation, and, before examining the development and ultimate fate of this french proposal, it may be well for a moment to consider the position of Germany in the matter of disarmament.It was certain that once Germany had joined the League the question of disarmament would come prominently to the fore. The Preamble to the military clauses of the Treaty of Versailles runs: &quot; In order to render possible the initiation of a general limitation of the armaments of all nations, Germany undertakes strictly to observe the military, naval and air clauses which follow.&quot; In reply to the German observations on these clauses, the Allied Governments in Paris wrote to the German delegation: &apos;&apos; The Allied and Associated Powers wash to make it clear that their requirements in regard to German armaments-were, not made solely with the object of rendering it impossible for Germany to resume her policy of military aggression. They are also the first steps towards that general reduction and limitation of armaments which they seek to bring about as one of the most fruitful preventives of war, and which it will be one of the first duties of the League of Nations to promote.&quot; Finally, in the Final Protocol of the Locarno Conference, the signatories gave expression to &quot;their firm conviction that the entry into force of these treaties and conventions will contribute largely to bringing about a moral detente amongst the nations, that it will greatly facilitate the solution of many political and economic problems in conformity with the interests and sentiments of the peoples, and that, in consolidating peace and security in Europe, it will have the effect of hastening appreciably the disarmament contemplated in article S of the Covenant of the League of Nations.&quot;The attitude of Germany on the Preparatory Committee has therefore been that, apart from the, general obligation on all Members of the League arising out of Article 8 of the Covenant, Germany has a special interest in seeing others disarm. She has herself been disarmed on the promise that this was the prelude to general disarmament; now that her own disarmament is complete, she wonders when others are going to begin. From 1922 till 1925 the League had upheld the theory that disarmament must wait on security, and that disarmament would follow as a natural result of any real advance towards security. If the League had held to that theory, German clamour for progress with general disarmament might perhaps have been allayed temporarily by representing that a direct approach to disarmament had been found impracticable, and by urging them to hope for results from what had already
been achieved in the way of security and from what might be expected of an extension of the Locarno system. But by appointing the Preparatory Committee in 1925, and by instructing it in 1926 to hasten the elaboration of a programme for a Conference, to be convened in 1927, based on the &quot; existing conditions in regard to regional and general security,&quot; the Assembly intimated that the time was ripe for a definite step towards disarmament, which was justified by existing political conditions. So that when the French delegation, at the last Assembly, proposed to divert the attention of the Preparatory Committee from disarmament to security, the Germans were bound to object. What they said, in effect, was : &quot; You told us last year that Locarno afforded sufficient security to enable a start to be made with disarmament, and you instructed the Preparatory Committee to prepare a Conference on that basis. Now you say that progress with disarmament is impossible without further progress in the matter of security. What has become of Locarno, and in what way is the situation less favourable now than it was last year ? We cannot go back to our people and tell them that Locarno turns out to be of no value for this purpose, and we must insist that the work should proceed on the existing basis. The Preparatory Committee must go on as it is, and finish its work.&quot;This was rather unanswerable, and these objections on the part of the German delegation were only overcome by a compromise whereby the Preparatory Committee shall meet again in November (or at the beginning of December) and constitute a new offshoot Committee to deal pari passu with security.It was generally understood, when the delegation left Geneva at the end of September last, that this meeting would be purely formal, that the new Committee would be constituted, and that both would then adjourn probably till early next year.Very little has been laid down in regard either to the composition of the new Committee or in regard to the relations between the two Committees. The Germans, for reasons explained above, objected to the Preparatory Committee mixing itself up with &quot; security &quot; questions : the French and Belgians wished to emphasise the interdependence of disarmament and security, and pretended to see disadvantages in the multiplication of Committees. Finally the general idea seemed to be that the Security Committee would be a sort of second self of the Preparatory Committee  would be. in fact, the same Committee sitting in a different capacity, with, possibly, some changes in personnel. For instance, whereas a Serb general sat for some time on the Preparatory Committee, the S.C.S. Government might wish to replace him by a more &quot; learned &quot; member on the Security Committee. The majority of Govern-ments would probably have representatives who could double the parts unless the two Committees were required to sit concurrently.As to the prospects of either Committee, it is difficult at the moment to see how they are likely to shape. In the absence of any direct negotiations between the Governments on the points which brought the Preparatory Committee to a standstill in April, we remain where we were, and from the experience then acquired it is not clear that another meeting will bring the parties closer together. If the present situation justifies the continental nations in saying that they dare not depart from the principle of giving military training to every able-bodied citizen, and if the same situation renders it necessary for us to adhere to the line which we took at Geneva in June and July as regards naval matters, no progress is possible, and there wrould appear to be justification for the French view that &quot;security &quot; is at fault. But that raises an awkward question with the Germans, and it completes the vicious circle disarmament proves impossible without security : the attempt at general security (Treaty of Mutual Assistance and Protocol) proves impracticable : &quot;regional&quot; security (Locarno) is attempted, but does not produce disarmament quickly enough, and in the attempt to hasten disarmament we find we are driven back to search for greater security. It is unfortunate that Locarno, which really does &quot; secure &quot; the situation in the most dangerous part of Europe, does not set an example in disarmament, for the reason that we had already disarmed ourselves, the Germans had had disarmament thrust upon them, and the French for reasons with which it is possible to sympathise-are in no hurry to achieve disarmament. They have, it is true, introduced a scheme which they maintain involves a reduction of armaments, but for reasons which it is impossible to examine here in detail, it does not amount to a very honest or very useful contribution to the problem. Perhaps one cannot blame them for taking every precaution for defence against so powerful and resourceful a nation as Germany&quot;. If a Locarno could have been devised in Central Europe, there might have been less excuse for the Little Entente, for instance, encircling a practically impotent Hungary with an altogether disproportionate ring
of armed forces. But further one travels east the more the Russian menace hangs over Europe, and so long as it is admitted as we should have to admit in any convention signed without a certainty of the honest participation of Russia that countries in Eastern and Central Europe must be allowed to reckon with this menace, the value of any agreement that we should be likely to get diminishes. The contagion would spread westward, and if any one country is allowed to keep excessive forces to guard its eastern frontier, its westerly neighbour has no guarantee that these might not eventually be used against it.All the foregoing seems to lead to no conclusion at all, except the negative one that disarmament cannot be imposed arbitrarily: it must follow automatically as it certainly would follow from a real sense of security. No single Government can wish to expend a penny more on armaments than what it judges absolutely necessary for its own safety; every Government would seize any opportunity to reduce military expenditure, and so relieve the voting taxpayer.Can the new Security Committee achieve anything useful? This seems very problematical. We do not know exactly how it will work, but these are the terms of reference given it by the last Assembly resolution : They are to seek security &quot; 1. In action by the League of Nations, with a view to promoting, generalising and co-ordinating special or collective agreements on arbitration and security.&quot; But it is questionable whether the League can do much to &quot; promote *&apos; in this sphere. If nations are prepared for arbitration and security agreements, they may be able to achieve them, but it is doubtful whether public exhortations from the League will assist them very greatly in their delicate task.&quot;2. In the systematic preparation of the machinery to be employed by the organs of the League of Nations with a view to enabling Members of the League to perform their obligations under the various articles of the Covenant.&apos;&apos; This was the most innocuous form to which we were able to reduce the Netherlands-French proposal for a fresh study of the Protocol. We were unable to resist it. as its authors pointed out that the Council had already ordered a study of certain articles ol the Covenant, and a Committee had already produced a comparatively innocuous work on article 11. Moreover, the Council is even now prosecuting enquiries into possible means of facilitating the meeting of the Council in emergencies, means of communication in times of crisis between the various Governments and the seat of the League, &amp;c. But it will almost inevitably involve an examination of article 16 and an attempt at a definition of the obligations arising therefrom, which leads us on to dangerous ground.&quot;3. In agreements which the States Members of the League may conclude among themselves, irrespective of their obligations under the Covenant, with a view to making their commitments proportionate to the degree of solidarity of a geographical or other nature existing between them and other States.&quot; This, so far as it can be understood, refers to agreements on the lines of the Locarno Treaties, and it is not easy to see exactly what role the League is expected to play.&quot; 4. And, further, in an invitation from the Council to the several States to inform it of the measures which they would be prepared to take, irrespective of their obligations under the Covenant, to support the CounciTs decisions or recommendations in the event of a conflict breaking out in a given region, each State indicating that, in a particular case, either all its forces, or a certain part of its military, naval or air forces, could forthwith intervene in the conflict to support the Council&apos;s decisions or recommendations.&quot; By this is meant, presumably, that the Council should collect and register the precise undertakings which any States might be prepared to give it as to&apos; the action which they might be ready to take against a Covenant-breaking State. If the question were put to us, we could reply by pointing to our obligations under the Locarno Treaties. It seems to be contemplated that other Governments, even though bound by no &quot;regional&quot; agreements such as Locarno, might be prepared to offer definite co-operation in support of the Covenant in certain definite circumstances.In addition to the above, two definite questions have been referred by the Assembly for study by the Security Committee : the proposal of the Finnish Govern-ment for assistance to States victims of aggression, and Dr. Nansen&apos;s proposal for an optional convention for compulsory arbitration of disputes.
If then, disarmament can only be expected to follow from increased security, what are the prospects of the Security Committee achieving anything tangible on the above lines ?The terms of reference clearly indicate two lines of advance one by means of increasing &quot;regional&quot; agreements, and the other by means of an elaboration of the Covenant with a view to making the sanctions provided therein more real and more effective.The former method depends mainly on the initiative of individual States. It may be adopted and followed by a number of them, but we cannot reckon on it, we cannot hurry them, and, in the light of experience, it must be confessed that the direct effect on disarmament is problematical.The second method is unlikely to produce any real result unless it is pushed to its logical conclusion which would not be far removed from the Protocol of 1924. And however logical that may be on paper, it is not a matter of practical politics now.The conclusion, therefore, seems to be as inevitable as it is depressing: States maintain their present armaments because they consider them indispensable to secure them against the dangers with which they are or might be threatened,&apos;and the size of these armaments is a measure of the feeling of insecurity that must still exist, for nearly all the armies of Europe are rather a symptom of fear than a gratuitous challenge to others. To dissipate this feeling of insecurity something more drastic and effective is required than isolated &quot; regional &quot; agreements, and if such a feeling exists, implying distrust and suspicion in all quarters, is it possible to believe that even a Protocol, which must depend for its efficacy on absolute good faith and confidence in the inevitability of its working, would effect such a radical improvement as to change the whole mood of Europe ?A. CADOGAN.October 26, 1927.This is a very able memorandum, but I am not altogether happy about it. Mr. Cadogan has not confined himself to a mere exposition of the past, but has added or rather interwoven an appreciation of the present and a forecast of the future.Now this part of his paper is purely and consistently negative and concludes on a note of despair. I think that His Majesty&apos;s Government ought to be far more positive. I suggest that His Majesty&apos;s Government can and should accept without reserve (1) and (3) and (4) of the Reference to the Security Committee. These I should interpret as a call to others to do what we have done by our Treaty of Locarno.On (2) I should adopt a waiting policy, leaving others to formulate proposals, but I should watch the proceedings carefully to see whether at a given moment it might not be necessary for us to raise definitely the effect of the withdrawal of the United States on the efficacy and practicability of using the methods of Article 16, and again I would press strongly the acceptance by other Powers (already given by us in principle) of the Finnish financial guarantee fund proposal.We can also support Dr. Nansems proposal within carefully defined limits. On this point Sir Cecil Hurst could give the Cabinet Committee useful help.Finally, as regards disarmament, I would urge that the Committee should most carefully review the differences recorded in the Report of the Preparatory Committee in the light of the subsequent proceedings at the Three-Power Naval Conference and see how our position is affected by them. It should, I submit, be our object to reach an agreement for such a measure, small and imperfect as it may be, of restriction or reduction of armaments as is actually possible. In this connection we ought particularly to consider what measure of support we may expect and from what quarters on the various points on which we are at present definitely in a minority.A.
