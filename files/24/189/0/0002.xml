Tnis document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.CABINET.SGRBT. of    f%P.  252(27).THE LAW RELATING TO THE SALE AND SUPPLY OF INTOXICATING LIQUOR.Memorandum by the Home Secretary.There is little doubt that, as soon as Parliament re-assemblesthe Government will be pressed to state the course they propose totake in rogard to the representations made last year in favour ofsome relaxation of the existing statutory restrictions on thesupply ol liquor in clubs.    As my colleagues will remember,  I circulated at the time a memorandum on this subject CP.99 (26) andwas authorised to stato that consideration of the suggestion, putforward to me at a Deputation I received, in favour of an enquiry to ascertain the facts,would be postponed until after LordSeuthborough&apos;s Committee on Disinterested Management of LicensedHouses had reported (Cabinet 11(26) Conclusion 5).    I subsequentlyanswered a number of Questions in the House of Commons to that effect and I would in particular draw 3-ttention to a reply given by captain Hacking to Mr. Remer on tho 19th  Tuly this year :-Mr. RELER asked the Home Secretary if he is now prepared to make a statement as to the Government&apos;s attitude with reference to the licensing laws?Captain HACKING:    As was stated last week, it is not yet possible to mako an announcement on this subject.    My hon. Friend would seem to have been mistaken when he said last week that the Prime Minister had stated he would give an answer to this question as soon as the Southborough Committee had reported. What the Prime Minister in his letter of Srd March said was -&quot;When that Report is received it will be necessary to consider not only the question of disinterested management, but also various other aspects of the licensing problem&quot;.    The Government have not yet had an opportunity to give these matters the careful consideration which is required before any statement can be made as to future action.As 1 indicated in the memorandum to which I have referred, theclub problem forms part only of a complicated wholo and cannot boisolated and detached for separate treatment.    Various questions were settled, more or less as a matter of compromise, in the licensing Act of 1921 and to take one of the matters then dealt
- 2 - 9with for separate treatment now would so disturb the balance of the compromise that the whole licensing law would, in the end, inevitably have to be re-openod.    Nor is the club problem the only one that has come to the front.    A memorandum is attached in which are set out briefly some of the more important issues which have provoked demands for amendment of the lawThere appear to me to bo three coura-33 open to the Government. First,  to stand by the Act of 19 21 and to repel any suggestion of enquiry or further legislation,    I do not consider that it would be proper or politic to tak9 this course.    Tho Government pledged themselves to consider various aspects of the licensing question after the Report of the Southborough Committee was received.    That Report was presented to Parliament in May last.    Moreover th9 organisations that approached me on the club problem represented a very large number of Conservative working men&apos;s and other clubs, and I suggest that it would be politically most inexpedient, in this matter,  to oppose to the representations of the Government&apos;s supporters a policy of blank inactivity-The second course is to introduce legislation in the near future to remove the grievances disclosed&quot;    This, in the imperfect state of the information available, would be most unwise *    Not unnaturally the agitation for amendment of the law has come from those on whom the restrictions are thought to press most closely and proposals to moot their views would inevitably, in many persons&apos;  opinions, be reactionary in character,  and would excite violent controversy&apos;.    Without a far wider knowledge of the facts than the Government at present possess,  it is difficult or impossible to detormine to which of the contending parties public opinion generally inclines.The third course - and the one which strongly commends itself to me - is to appoint a Royal Commission (if possible, non partizan)  to inquire into the whole field of licensing legislation. Such an inquiry would, I think, not be -unwelcome to the Temperance organisations and,  to  judge from Sir Herbert Field&apos;a
24th Occober,  1927.remarks at the Party Conforonce at Cardiff at the beginning of this month, would be accepted by the interests he represents.    Moreover, there has been no big official enquiry since that conducted by the Pool Commission which reported at the end of last century, and conditions have changed very much sinco then.    The Liquor Control Board in the War found that many of the provisions of the Licensing Lav; were unsuitable and though seme of the war-time-provisions were modified and kept alive for peace-time by the Licensing Act of 1921 the review then undertaken was incomplete and it cannot be said with certainty that the provisions now existing are the best that can bo devised, in the interests of society.Further, while inquiry would certainly strengthen the hands of the Government, were legislation found to be necessary, it would also,  since^work could not be completed within a short space of time, have the very desirable effect of postponing any legislation until after the next general election.I think my colleagues will appreciate that there are enough questions to justify a full Enquiry.W.J.H.
Tho following, excluding the problem presented by the ClubB, are the main points on which amendment of the Lav/ relating to licensing has been sought.    It is urged -1.    That the hours during which licensed premise^ may remain open for the sale of liquor should be rigid and uniform&apos;    Under the Licensing Act of 1921 provision was made for a system of &quot;permitted hours&quot; for the sale or supply of intoxicating liquor on licensed promises by which roughly speaking a given number of hours should be distributed by the Liconsing Justices-    Licensing Justices are therefore able to fix hours within the limits imposed by the Act as they think most convenient for the needs of the district.    Some areas roquire earlier hours than others, e.g. owing to the character of the principal employment in tho district,  and under the PvUles made under the Act an opportunity was given for the inhabitants of any area to make representations each year to the Licensing Justices at their General Annual Licensing Meeting, with a view to getting the most convenient hours fixed.It is objected to the present system that administrative inconvenience results,  especially in the Metropolis where varying hours prevail.,  that the absurd anomaly is created of licensed houses on the ono side of a street being required to close one hour earlier than liconsod houses on the other side and that thirsty individuals migrate to areas whore the closing hour is one hour later, for the last hour&apos;s drinking.2.    That the distribution through the day of the permitted/ hours for the sale&apos; of liquor should not be left in the hands of the Licensing Justices who are in no way representative of the opinion of the community and speak and vote as their private conscience directs them.3.    That licensed houses In the County of Monmouth should be allowed to open on Sundays.    It is provided in the Licensing Act of 1921 that in Wales and Monmouthshire there shall be no permitted hours for licensed promises on S-inday.
4.    That th9 privileges accorded to the bpna fide traveller before the war should be restored.    The Act of 1910, which imposed penalties on the sale of intoxicating liquor during hours when licensed premises were directed to be closed, contained exceptions in favour of sale to private friends, lodgers, bona fide travellers, and persons at a railway station arriving or departing by rail. During the war the Central Control Board (Liquor Traffic) provided that the hours laid down in their Orders for sale of intoxicating liquor were not to be subjected to any exception in favour of bona fide travellers.The bona fide traveller   as known before the War is inconsistent with modern conditions and with the rccoptod system of shorter and broken hours.5.    That hotels should be dealt with on a different footing from public houses.    Under the present law, for instance, the licenses for a hotel and for a public house,  are alike subject to similar conditions.    It is urged that conditions which may be admirable in themselves for the public house trade are ill adapted to suit the modern development of hotel-keeping.S.    That owners of licensed premises are prevented by Licensing Justices from carrying out desirable structural alterations and improvements.    At present the consent of tho Licensing Justices is required to any alteration in licensed premises which gives increased facilities for drinking,  conceals from observation any part of the premises usod for drinking or affects either internal communication in the house or communication with the street. This point was considered by tho Southborough Committee and was the subject of an incomplete and inconclusive recommendation.I may add that the Southborough Committee did not arrive at any definite conclusion on the very big question of the efficioncy of the State Management of the Liquor Traffic -commonly known as the Carlisle Scheme - nor the equally important question of disinterested management and the conversion of drinking saloons into Parisian Oafos.
In addition to the above matters, there are wider questions as to whether the present restrictions on hours and othor provisions of the Licensing Acts (some of which are old) are suited to the changed and changing social noeds of the&quot;community -It has to be determined whether the provisions or any of them should be relaxed or abolished or made moro severe.
