&quot;This document ia the property of His Britannic Majeaty&apos;s Government.Printed for the Cabinet, October, 1927.CLP. 354(27).THE CABINET.DISARMAMENT.(Previous C.P.-2U (27).)MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.1. The Secretary of State for Air in his memorandum (CP. 234 (27) ) asks what 0160 our policy afc the next meeting of the Preparatory Commission is to be on the subject of 1499 trained reserves.The factor which will govern the comparative strength of armies must be chiefly effectives. My military advisers have always maintained (see C.I.D. 817 B) that no limitation of effectives was of much value which did not include a limitation of trained reserves. This view was strenuously resisted by most of the conscriptionist countries, who maintained that in the existing state of security they must retain the right to train every available man. The reduction of the period of service appears to be the main concession towards limiting the offensive power of armies to which conscriptionist countries are prepared to subscribe.It will be observed that the delegations of Great Britain, Germany and America all entered reservations at the first reading of the Draft Convention in the Preparatory Commission on the subject of the inclusion of trained reserves in the totals of military effectives. The principle is fundamental and I think we should adhere to it; I cannot see that any limitation of effectives which ignores this principle can be regarded as a serious step towards the reduction of armaments.2. The Secretory of State for Air asks if we are to insist upon this point at the risk oi breaking up the Conference.I observed in the discussions in the Assembly of the League of Nations that the French representative, as well as other delegates, stated that agreement upon Land Disarmament was practically complete, and that the Naval questions were the only ones outstanding. The French realise that the difficulty in reaching agreement will be considerable, and they are undoubtedly endeavouring to gloss over the divergence on Land Disarmament in order that they may saddle us with the s. .le responsibility if a rupture takes place on the Naval issue. It seems, therefore, more than ever incumbent upon us to make clear to public opinion the complete inadequacy of the French proposals for Land Disarmament, and that disagreement on this point is not less acute than upon Naval questions. At the previous meetings the view of Lord Cecil was that we should allow the French to have the greater say as to Land Disarmament, while our views should have the corresponding preponderance on Naval questions. While we undoubtedly deferred to the French on Land Disarmament, they showed little or no disposition to accept our views as regards Navies. I am therefore of opinion, as I have already said, that we should press our views as regards the limitation of trained reserves to the utmost, and, if a breakdown is to occur, our representative should ensure that it does not take place upon the Naval issue alone.ri. The question of the limitation of material is, from  our point of view, very much more complex. We cannot at present tie our hands in this respect owing to our mechanisation policy. It is not yet clear to what mechanisation is leading us, and we do not yet know what types of armoured fighting vehicles we shall be forced to produce. Any limitation which Ave accepted at the present time, although it could be arranged so as to provide ample scope for development during the next live years, might still make things very difficult for us subsequently as it became necessary to review the. Convention from time to time. ,.Cony No.   3 Q(b27/17)   100   10/27   w.o.p.   3327
As mechanisation advances large national armies become of less value. No Continental nation therefore welcomes this era, which destroys their comparatively cheap form of defence, i.e. man-power. If, say after the lapse of 15 years, we found that in our evolution we had reached the limit of certain conditions which at the present time we considered to be well on the safe side, it might well prove to be very difficult to obtain agreement to the extension of these limits. The whole military opinion on the Continent would be against the numerically small British Army becoming an increasingly powerful military factor, and we must expect to meet with strong opposition to our desire to change from men to machines.We cannot therefore afford to stabilise for all time a limitation, either on material or expenditure on material.4. Though we have sound reasons for objecting to these forms of limitation, I recognise that it is necessary that we should have, at any rate in reserve, some construc-tive proposal to make at Geneva for dealing with so important a principle as the limitation of material. At the previous meeting of the Preparatory Commission these two methods of limitation were both discussed. The Germans wished a direct limitation by categories, whilst the French recommended a limitation on expenditure on material. There were marked differences of opinion, and grave objection was taken to both proposals. Under the circumstances it was unnecessary for the British representative to disclose our attitude. This disagreement may not continue at subsequent meetings, and it is desirable that we should have a constructive proposal even if it does not meet with unanimous acceptance at Geneva. It will be remembered that, when the original instructions to the British representative were framed, it was suggested that we should be prepared to accept a limitation of total budgetary expenditure for Land armaments, in view of the difficulty of finding any satisfactory method of imposing some limitation on material. This has the advantage, irom the Army point of view7, that extension of a mechanisation policy can be met in part by savings on personnel, and we retain the right to expend our money as we think fit. This proposal did not at the time meet with the approval of the Committee of Imperial Defence, and we were therefore left without any definitely concrete proposals-for limiting material. After a careful examination of all other possibilities, my military advisers can find no other solution of this difficult question, and they therefore recommend that this proposal for limitation of budgetary expenditure on Land armaments he further considered.L.
