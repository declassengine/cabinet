THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.CABINET.WASHINGT ON   HOURS   C ONVENTION.Memorandum by the Minister of Labour.CRET. Copy No.*$0. . ..I\285(27) .On the 20th July the Cabinet again considered the situation regarding the Washington Hours Convention and, in pursuance of the policy adopted at previous meetings, authorised me to continue my negotiations with the Employers by telling them that the view of the Government is that (having regard to the history of the matter since 1919) the Hours question must be dealt with and that the Government invited the Employers to co-operate in the framing of proposals which would be governed by two main considerations: (l) that, while embodying the principle of the 48 hour week, they should follow in the main the existing industrial conditions in this country and should be calculated to interfere as little as possible with those conditions;   and (2) that the proposals should form a suitable basis for a Convention designed to secure greater international uniformity of hours.In accordance with that decision I saw the representatives of the Confederation on the 27th July and told them the view the Government held,     They told me that they had merely come to hear what I had to say in order that they might then go away and discuss it with their colleagues. They promised to have the discussion in September, but I was later informed that they were unable to have a meeting until October, and it v/as not until October 19th that they were ready to see me again.      They then told me that they had no power from their constituent organisations to negotiate and that their authority did not extend beyond agreement to
ascertain what proposala I had to put before them.    It was evident that, whatever might be the views held by some of the Confederation representatives individually, the general feeling was one of extreme caution and reserve.As the Cabinet will re:nember, the position this question has reached is that any european prospect of carrying agreed legislation bcsed upon the Washington Convention is out of the question, end the object of talking to the Employers was to see whether a revised Convention could be made acceptable. The London Conference, so far as the countries represented were concerned, achieved a large measure of egreeinent on certain of the main difficulties of interpretation of the terms of the Convention.     There has since been formal ratification by Belgium, and France has since passed legislation for provisional ratification subject to ratification by Germany and Greet 3ritain^     Italy has already ratified subject to ratificstion by certain other countries and Germany has hod under discussion a Bill with the object of ratification.   In the latter country the future position is somewhat uncertain but it is cleer that both from the international and from the home point of view this country cannot pursue a purely negative policy.    V7e cannot, in view cf the pest, state that our policy has now been changed and that we do not propose to go forward with Hours Legislation.   On the other hand mere inaction is now equally impossible to defend.The position is now complicated by the fpot that,    at a recent meeting of the Governing Body of the International Labour Office, the representative of the French Employers made a statement which was tantamount to a proposal to include the revision of the existing Hours Convention in
the agenda for the 1930 International Labour Conference ^ana it.was agreed to take a decision on this at the next meeting in January,     Now that the question of revision has been raised, it Is bound to have a growing effect on the whole position.     The statements made by successive Coalition and Conservative Governments and the action taken by this Government in calling the London Conference have all indicated a willingness to accept a Convention suitable to British conditions.     In particular, in his statement in the House of Lords on 4th May, 1927, Lord Balfour(following a decision of the Cabinet) declared that, while it was essential that agreement should bo reached as to the meaning and effect of the dociiment to which they subscribed., it v:as the intention of the Government to legislate and to ratify.Unless therefore we are prepared to state that we are content with the Washington Convention plus tho London Agreement and are prepared to go forward with it, we are bound to support the proposal for revision in order to get a workable Convention.If, however, we can get a workable Convention, then we shall be committed to ratifying it and passing the necessary legislation-It seems to me, however, that in a matter of this kind we should endeavour to appear at Geneva with a policy that is agreed upon by both the Employers and the Trade Unions. In any event, I do not like a situation in which - as is the case now - the Government carry the full odium of the failure to ratify the Washington Convention without being able to make known the fact that it is the opposition of the iimployers that is responsible in the main for a failure either to ratify the existing Convention or to take any active steps to secure a revised Convention,
I think,.-therefore, that the next step to take is for me to suggest both to the Employers1 Confederation and to the Trade Union Congress fieneral Council that, with our co-operation, they should unite to consider what is the policy in relation to the Hours Convention that is most likely both to fit British Industry and to help it by ensuring some effective international action that would bring other countries more into line with this country.    I shall, howovor, probably find a continuance of the obstructive inortia that has hitherto characterised the procedure of the Employers in this matter.    Although their formal and written statements may be regarded as supporting(though more by way of inference than direct statement) the policy of proceeding by way of revision, there is no doubt that, in fact, they will endeavour to postpone further Hours legislation in this country as long as possible.It is necessary therefore that the situation should be clearly understood by my colleagues , before the employers are again approached on this subject, since I apprehend that there may be very strong opposition on their part.    That situation is that they should be informed that the Government is prepared to insist that in some way or other the question of the Washington Convention must be settled and that it accepts the position that, if a new Draft Convention which in the opinion of the Government is     satisfactory to this country  s the result of further discussions at Geneva, Hours legislation will have to be undertaken at some time in the future to give its provisions effect.I raise the question now as a matter of urgency, because (just as the Opposition are pressing that we should declare what our policy is) the representatives of the Unions are pressing me to see them and to tell them what we propose to do.(Intd. )    A.S-M.Ministry of Labour. 19th November,1927.
