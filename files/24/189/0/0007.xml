Q CP. 257 (27).THE CABINET.THE CONSTITUTION OF A FORGE OF &quot;WHOLE-TIME SPECIAL CONSTABLES FOR GENERAL SERVICE IN a civil EMERGENCY.JOINT MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARIES OF STATE FOR HOME AFFAIRS AND WAR.1. The General Purposes Committee of the Supply and Transport Standing Sub-  w 0. 79 Committee have appointed a &quot; Protection Sub-Committee &quot;, with instructions to enquire    aud report on the general aspect of the problem of protection in a civil emergency, with  3072&quot;&quot; special reference, inter alia, to the constitution of a force of whole time special constables to form a police reserve.   In both the recent periods of national emergency (those of 1921 and 1926), steps were taken to improvise a force of this kind, but the division of responsibility between the War and Home Offices differed in each case.   In 1921 the War Office was entirely responsible both for the executive control and for the organization, recruitment and administration of the Defence Force which was raised.   In 1926, the War Office provided the organization for raising, equipping and administering the Civil Constabulary Reserve, but the executive control of the force was in the hands of the Home Office and the Chief Officer of Police.In the course of discussion as to the most suitable scheme for providing a similar force for use in any future emergency, it has become clear that the views of the Home Office and the War Office are fundamentally divergent on the question of the functions to be undertaken by the Army in regard to any such scheme, and the matter is accordingly submitted for Cabinet decision.2. The Home Office and the War Office are agreed as to the desirability of having machinery pre-arranged to facilitate the raising of a force of whole-time special constables ; but while the War Office will willingly place at the disposal of the Home Office in planning such machinery the experience gained by the military authorities in previous emergencies, they are averse from undertaking in the future responsibilities similar to those which they were driven by force of circumstances to accept in 1921 and 1926 when no other machinery existed. They feel that it should now be possible to create suitable machinery ; but, as a matter of principle, they consider that the raising of a force of this character is outside their proper sphere of responsibility. In comparison with the methods employed in the emergency of 1921, those of 1926 showed a partial recognition of the principle that the provision of a reserve force in support of the civil power is primarily the duty of the civil authority, since in the latter emergency the executive control of the Civil Constabulary Reserve was placed in the hands of the Home Office. Nevertheless, it is the view of the War Office that the functions of the Army should be entirely dissociated from those of the Police.There are, moreover, practical objections to the administration of such a force by the War Office. The only existing framework at the disposal of the War Office for the raising of a fresh force is that of the Territorial Army ; the use of this framework in 1926 was in the circumstances unavoidable, and, owing to the state of public opinion in that emergency, was accepted by the Territorial Army ; but the recurrence of similar conditions in any future emergency cannot be regarded as certain, and recruiting has probably suffered. It is laid down in the Regulations for the Territorial Army that officers and men are not liable to be called out in aid of the civil power as a military body unless they are already embodied, and the War Office feel that the spirit of this condition(b27/17)   100   11/27   w.o.f.   334gSECRET.
o  service in the Territorial Army would be violated, and the popularity of this integral part of the military forces liable to be seriously affected, by any permanent connection with auxiliary police forces for use in industrial emergencies. Moreover, if a period of civil emergency coincided with one of military commitment or emergency, the War Office would not be free to render the same assistance to the Home Office as they did in 1926, since the military situation would absorb all their energies, and, in particular, the embodiment of the Territorial Army would inevitably result in the complete disorganiza-tion of an auxiliary police force erected on such a basis. Finally, such reductions have recently been made in the maintenance and reserve stocks of supplies, clothing and stores of the Army that they barely suffice for military requirements, and the War Office cannot contemplate the possibility of their being regarded as available for other purposes.3. On the other hand, the Home Office are advised b)7 the Protection Sub-Committee that in raising an auxiliary police force it would be essential to rely upon machinery other than that of the regular police force. The value of an auxiliary force for the purpose of avoiding recourse to military aid increases with the promptitude with which it is available on the outbreak of an emergency, and it is precisely at such a time that the whole strength of the regular police force must be concentrated on the needs of the moment. Moreover, for obvious reasons, provision for the accommodation and provisioning of an auxiliary force cannot be made in advance by the regular police. While, therefore, the Home Office sympathize and to some extent agree with the War Office as to the desirability of tnain-taining a complete separation between the Territorial Army and auxiliary police forces, they are forced to conclude that since the raising of such a force must depend at any rate in part upon resources other than those of the regular police, there are many advantages in relying upon those of the Territorial Army. The Home Office consider that it should be possible for the recruitment and payment of personnel for an auxiliary police force to be carried out by Chief Officers of Police, and that, therefore, only the accommodation, supply, and, in part, the equipment of the auxiliary force would fall upon the machinery of the Territorial Army. But without such assistance from this machinery, the Home Office fear that the organization of an auxiliary police force could only be effected, if at all, with great difficulty and after long delay, involving in the meantime an added risk that -the civil authorities would be forced to call upon military aid. Their suggestion is that a plan involving military assistance to the limited extent above indicated should be worked out in detail on the distinct understanding that it would not be put into operation without express Cabinet authority given in relation to the particular circumstances of an actual emergency. The only practical alternative in their view is to rely entirely upon improvisation after an emergency has actually arisen.4. The two Departments are agreed on the importance of deciding in advance the measures to be taken to provide an auxiliary police force if and when required, and they accordingly submit for Cabinet decision the question whether the Home Office should be entirely responsible for such measures or whether in certain eventualities responsibility should fall in part upon the War Office as contemplated in the previous paragraph.W.
