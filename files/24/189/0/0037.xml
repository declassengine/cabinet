Some Observations on Sir C. Hursfs Memorandum of November 10 (CP. 286 (27) ) on the suggestion for an Agreement with the United States in regard to the exercise of Belligerent Rights at Sea.(Circulated by direction of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.)LEAVING on one side the more purely legal aspects of the case, there are in this memorandum certain points of a political or semi-political character with which, I think, it is difficult for this Department fully to agree. After discussing the matter with Mr. Vansittart, I venture to put forward the following considera-tions, which might perhaps be discussed verbally with Sir Cecil Hurst: 1. Sir Cecil Hursfs memorandum is in the main based on the assumption that, in order to secure an agreement with the United States on this subject, we must necessarily be called upon to abandon some important right which we have hitherto exercised. Sir Maurice Hankey also looks upon the conclusion of such an agreement as merely a repetition of the errors committed in signing the Declaration of London. But can either assumption be taken for granted at this time ?Taking the Declaration of London first, it is only necessary to mention that one of the most powerful criticisms directed against the Declaration by opponents in this country was that it abandoned the application to conditional contraband of the doctrine of continuous voyage. This abandonment was, however, at the time more distasteful to the United States Government than to His Majesty&apos;s Government, and I see no reason to think that the United States views on this point have changed. This and other criticised points in the Declaration represented concessions to the &quot; continental&quot; Powers departures from our hitherto accepted doctrine which need not, and indeed should not, be repeated in any Anglo-American Convention.In my memorandum of the 17th October (Appendix III in CP. 258/27) I endeavoured to show that, on the basis of our experience during the war, it would be wrong to assume that no agreement with the United States was possible unless it departed from the principles of law which have hitherto been observed by either country when a belligerent and which have received the sanction of the British and American Prize Courts. Since then an examination of the United States Naval Prize Code of 1900 (as modified in 1903) has reinforced the above conclusion. Only in the matter of the immunity of convoys from search and the immunity of coast fishing vessels from capture does there appear to be any fundamental divergence in so far as the rules of contraband blockade and the capture of enemy vessels are concerned. &quot;Writing in the &quot; Times&quot; of the 10th April, 1901, Professor Holland, referring to the Naval War Code, stated that &quot; on most debatable points the rules are in accordance with the views of this country.&quot; This naval code was, on the eve of the London Naval Conference of 1908-1909, submitted to His Majesty&apos;s Government by the United States Govern-ment as representing their view on these questions at that time. In communicating this document, the State Department quoted a passage from the instructions sent to the United States delegate at the second Peace Conference, from which I extract the following :-&quot; The Order putting this code into force was revoked by the Navy Department in 1904, not because of any change of views as to the rules which it contained, but because many of those rules, being imposed upon the forces of the United States by the Order, would have put our naval forces at a disadvantage as against the forces of other Powers, upon whom the rules were not binding.&quot; [16836]
The State Departments note to our Embassy added that the attitude of the United States had not changed since the second Hague Peace Conference and that the relevant portions of the above instructions [including the code] wore as applicable to the London Naval Conference as they were to the Hague Conference. There is nothing to show that the United States Government have since gone back on the views expressed in 1008. Indeed, their relative naval strength having enormously increased since that date, it is reasonable to suppose; that the old American thesis of &quot;freedom of the seas&quot; is also sinking into the background: an America drawing rapidly up to an equality Of naval strength with this country is on the whole unlikely in the future to show much enthusiasm for securing the immunity from capture of private enemy ships. If this proves to be the ease, I cannot see what important belligerent right we are likely to bo asked by the Americans to abandon.As stated in the earlier memorandum, the principal difficulties to be anticipated relate to the diversion of ships to a homo port for visit and search, the substitution of a &quot; long-distance&quot; blockade for the earlier type of close blockade and the censorship of mails, as exercised during the war. These are all extensions of our earlier practice necessitated by the changing conditions under which both modern trade and modern warfare are carried on. If we play our cards carefully, we may well succeed in bringing the United States along with us as a partner in a logical adaptation to present-day necessities of old-fashioned rules no longer capable of giving full effect to the principles on which they were based. But such a result would only be possible at a time when both countries are at peace; not when we are already engaged in a life and death struggle.2. The example of a full League war quoted by Sir Cecil Hurst in 14 and 15 of his memorandum is certainly one in which an agreement with the United States would prove less useful than in the case of other types of war. Even in this case, however, it is difficult to agree that such an understanding would be entirely useless from a political point of view. United States dislike of the League and all *cs works is a factor with which we who will have to apply the naval pressure in a League war must count.But can we afford to neglect the possibility of our being engaged in a war in which the League takes no part&apos;?Under the Covenant as it stands there are several possible ways in which a war could be waged without the League States taking an active part. Thus Article 15 of the Covenant, dealing with disputes between members of the League, contains the following paragraphs : &quot; If the Council fails to reach a report which is unanimously agreed to by the members thereof, other than the Representatives of one or more of the parties to the dispute, the Members of the League reserve to themselves the right to take such action as they shall consider necessary for the maintenance of right and justice.If the dispute between the parties is claimed by one of them, and is found by the Council, to arise out of a matter which by international law is solely within the domestic jurisdiction of that party, the Council shall so report, and shall make no recommendation as to its settlement.&quot;Again, Article 17, dealing with disputes between a member of the League and a State which is not a member of the League, contains the following paragraph : &quot; If both parties to the dispute when so invited refuse to accept the obligations of membership in the League for the purposes of such dispute, the Council may take such measures and make such recommendations as will prevent hostilities and will result in the settlement of the dispute.&quot;In none ol&apos; the cases mentioned in the above paragraph does Article 10 (which imposes what for want of a better term one may call a &quot; League war &quot;) come automatically into operation, and it seems more than probable that in such cases the war may be confined to the parties immediately interested in the dispute. Apart from tho above it seems necessary to reckon with the possibly remoto contingency that, when League opinion in regard to any particular dispute is fairly evenly divided, the machinery for League intervention may break clown at an early stage, thus paralysing any corporate action by tho League of Nations.
Types of war other than that cited by Sir C. Hurst seem therefore to merit consideration before we can conclude that an Anglo-American agreement is unnecessary.3.   In paragraph 16 of his memorandum Sir C. Hurst states: &quot; The effect on the mind of the American people would probably be to make them think that Great Britain was ready to negotiate because she was afraid of the United States and felt that she could not compete. The big navy party in America would exploit the situation accordingly.&quot;1 do not believe that this would be the predominating effect on the mind of the American people, but, oven if it were, this circumstance would hardly assist the big navy party in America as suggested. The success of that party&apos;s propaganda depends not on a realisation that Great- Britain may be afraid of the United States, but on the opposite consideration, namely, that the United States have something to fear from the British navy. There is ample evidence to show that it is precisely this danger of a dispute with the British Empire in regard to the treatment of private property at sea which is being used by the big navy party to exert pressure on the Administration and Congress to increase the United States navy to &quot; parity &quot; of strength with the British navy.4. At the end of paragraph 16 Sir C. Hurst states : &quot; If the attempt to negotiate an agreement failed, the situation would be worse than before.&quot; This, of course, is true of almost any attempt to negotiate an agreement on any contro-versial subject, but the danger might be reduced to a minimum if the cautious method of approach which has been proposed were to be adopted and no formal British proposals were to be put forward until we were certain that the United States Government were ready to talk and to talk reasonably.5.   Paragraph 17 (1) (b) of the memorandum states : &quot; If we cannot maintain our naval superiority as against the United States, an agreement of the type proposed would prevent the influence of Great Britain being used to swing the belligerent practice in the direction of what the United States have hitherto meant by the phrase &apos; the freedom of the seas *.&quot;With the conditions in which naval warfare and commercial enterprise are conducted constantly shifting, it would be reasonable to suggest to the United States Government that any agreement come to should be subject to denunciation or revision every five years. If at the present moment the Committee of Imperial Defence should recommend that our claims in the matter of contraband and blockade should be put at the maximum, it seems unlikely that before the expiration of five years the position could have so changed as to necessitate His Majesty&apos;s Government urging a revision of the rules of war in the direction of &quot; the freedom of the seas.&quot; In other words, if the experts are content now with the rules and practices which emerged from the Great War, it seems hardly likely that they would have completely reversed themselves by the year 1932 or thereabouts.The above points are submitted with all due deference in case they may be considered worthy of further consideration or discussion.R. L. CRAIGIE.Foreign Office, November 16, 1927.
