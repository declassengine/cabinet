[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1927.CONFIDENTIAL. Copy No.   30CP. 286 (27).Reference CP. 258 (27).BELLIGERENT RIGHTS AT SEA.WHILE CP. 258 was being printed for circulation, I mentioned to Sir M. Hankey that I was proposing to bring this subject before the Cabinet. He was good enough to supply me within a few days with a memorandum embodying his strongly-held view that we should enter into no new engagement restrictive of our liberty.I believe the Cabinet will be glad to have his opinion as well as the observations made upon it and on the whole subject by Sir Cecil Hurst, who is also opposed to negotiation. I therefore circulate them with my cwn paper.On one thing we are all agreed that the question is of immense importance, and that the answer, whether negative or affirmative, is fraught with grave possibilities. I have formed no definite conclusion. I ask the Cabinet for no decision until the question has been thoroughly examined by the most competent committee that we can choose; but I cannot take the responsibility which would be mine if, because I am not prepared at present to give a definite answer to the question which I have raised, I refrained from calling the attention of the Cabinet to it and by my inaction, in fact, decided it in the negative.A.

[This Document is SECRET.-LOCK- AND *MEMORANDUM BY SIR M. HANKEY ON BLOCKADE AND the laws OF WAR.FOR several decades before the outbreak of the Great War, a period during which there was no unlimited war and, indeed, no great war in which sea power was a paramount consideration, there grew up a tendency to assume that war was a matter solely for fighting men and that the civil population ought to be exempted from its-hardships. Professor Oppenheim, in his Treatise on International Law (First Edition, Part II, Chapter 11, Section 178) shows how, after the Declaration of Paris, 1856, the Continental Powers and the United States of America worked for the abolition of the right of capture of property at sea. &quot; It cannot be denied,&quot; he continues, &quot; that, as the matter stands, it was the opposition of Great Britain which has prevented the abolition of the rule that private enemy vessels and goods may be captured.&quot; By the beginning of the present century there were many people of liberal and pacific tendencies even in this country who, in the absence of any modern experience to bring home the importance of economic pressure to this country as a weapon of offence, inclined towards some alleviation of the old rigours of aaval warfare.2. The exercise in the Russo-Japanese War by both countries of what they conceived to be their belligerent rights in the search, capture and sinking of neutral vessels, and the protests made by the business community, tended to rivet attention on the neutral aspects of the question, with the result that international law took a definite turn in the direction of limiting the freedom of belligerents. The situation, so far as this country was concerned, is explained in the following extract from a speech by Earl Beauchamp in the House of Lords on the 12th December, 1911 : &quot; During the Russo-Japanese War the Foreign Office was inundated with a number of complaints from British traders and British merchants, who complained of various acts which were done in the course of the war, but, still more, they complained of the want of certainty with regard to the state of thelaw.....    There was very little that the Foreign Office could do.    Therewas no arbitration possible; and if the belligerents in that case or in any other case refuse arbitration, there is very little that any Foreign Office can do insuch circumstances.....That avas the position to which the present Secretaryof State succeeded when he came into office, and he came to the conclusion that it was eminently desirable that, if possible, some means should be devised by which the decision of a belligerenfs Court should be subject to an appeal in cases relating to neutrals; and when the Second Peace Conference at The Hague took place, the British delegates, and also the delegates from other nations, went there with instructions to see if something could be done in the matter.&quot;*3. The Second Peace Conference (1907) drew up a draft &quot; Convention concerning the Establishment of an International Prize Court,&quot; which was signed by the representatives of all the Great Powers except Russia and many of the smaller Powers.   Eleven States did not sign the Convention.4. The International Prize Court, however, had no agreed code of law to administer, and, before the Convention could be ratified and the Court set up, it was felt to be necessary to compile such a code. The British Government, accordingly, summoned a Conference on the subject, which drew up the famous Declaration of London, 1909. . .5. In 1907, when the Second Peace Conference met, we were in a transition stage in regard to our preparations for war. Prior to the entente with France, our thoughts had been directed across the Channel. And although by 1907 much had been done in the direction of adjusting the&apos; distribution of the Fleet and coast defences to the new situation, no comprehensive study had yet been made of the questions of blockade and economic pressure in a war with Germany.    The* Parliamentary Debates, Lords, 1911, Vol. X.4194   [16812] b
&apos;.   1vConvention for the Establishment of an International Prize Court, therefore, was drawn up at a time when no data existed for examining its effect on our belligerent rights in a war with Germany.6. In the course of an enquiry (conducted under Mr. Asquith&apos;s Chairmanship) in 1908-9 by the Committee of Imperial Defence into the Military Needs of the Empire as affected by the Continent of Europe, the Admiralty submitted a powerful Memorandum as to the possibilities of economic pressure on Germany, which made a strong impression on the Committee, with the result that a series of enquiries was undertaken by the Committee into some of the means by which such pressure could be exercised.7. In these circumstances, it is somewhat surprising that the Declaration of London was never at any stage referred for examination by the Committee of Imperial Defence. Perhaps it was thought that the inclusion in the British Delegation of Sir Charles Ottley, the Secretary of the Committee, and of Admiral Slade, the Director of Naval Intelligence, was a sufficient safeguard. However this may be, the Declaration never was referred to the Committee of Imperial Defence. But, when it was published, the present Secretary of the Committee of Imperial Defence (at that time the Naval Assistant Secretary) wrote two long Memoranda pointing out the adverse effect which the Declaration would have on our power to put pressure on an enemy, as revealed by the detailed enquiries of the Committee of Imperial Defence. They are too long to give in full, but the following extract from one of them sums up on one of the most formidable heads.of the indictment : &quot; The fact is that, if the Declaration of London is ratified, we shall, in the event of even a successful war with Germany, be in a most humiliating position. We can blockade the North Sea ports, but we can do absolutely nothing to prevent the trade of Germany being carried in neutral bottoms to the Baltic ports or through neutral ports in neighbouring countries. While we are carefully watching the mouth of the Elbe the trade of Hamburg will continue in neutral ships, which will pass through the Belt and the Kiel Canal, the only additional cost being the enhanced freight due to the withdrawal of its German flag, and the slightly lengthened voyage round the Skaw The first of these causes of additional cost will be reduced as time goes on and more neutral vessels are attracted, and, no doubt, by the bond fide purchase by neutrals (possibly with capital supplied from Germany) of German merchant ships, which will take the place of the neutral vessels in their ordinary routes.These questions were insufficiently studied before the Declaration of London was entered into. There is no instance to be found in modern history of a war in which commerce has played a vitally important part, owing to the fact that recent wars have not been fought between nations susceptible as are Great Britain and Germany to attack through their commerce, and there are no data on which to calculate what means it will be necessary to adopt in such a war. The difficulties of blockade, due to modern inventions, suggest that even greater latitude may be necessary in the future than in the past. The negotiators of the Declaration of London have made the fatal error of basing their agreement not on the experience of past wars (for in the Napoleonic wars and all previous wars, when commerce was an important consideration, the greatest latitude was claimed and exercised) and not on a scientific appreciation of possible future wars, but have rested themselves on the experience of a few very recent wars in which the weapon of sea power, as a means of putting pressure on the inferior naval power, had no scope for exertion.Yet, in a Continental war, Great Britain has no other weapon of bringing an enemy to terms except that of her sea power. The position is still that described by Mahan in his &apos; Influence of Sea Power upon the French Revolution and Empire &apos; (Vol. II, p. 284) :-&apos; The battle between the sea and the land was to be fought out on commerce. England had no army wherewith to meet Napoleon; Napoleon had no navy to cope with that of his enemy. As in the case of an impregnable fortress, the only alternative for either of these contestants was to reduce the other by starvation.&apos;On these grounds alone there would appear to be the strongest possible case for a rejection of the Declaration of London. The objections to this instrument, however, do not end here.&quot;
Sir Charles Ottley, who did not agree with these criticisms, nevertheless forwarded them to several people in authority. They fell on deaf ears. The writer was advised verbally by a very high officer in the Admiralty, who had read his Paper, to drop the matter, as no instrument of this kind could possibly survive the test of war a remark which, though prophetic, was not a good ground for allowing the Convention to pass.8. If the criticism of the Declaration of London in inside circles was numerically feeble, it was far otherwise outside. The publication of the Declaration was followed by a storm of public criticism and adverse propaganda promoted by Mr. Thomas Gibson Bowles. One hundred and twenty retired Admirals signed a protest. Resolutions poured in from Chambers of Commerce and other public bodies. The Conservative party, then in opposition, took the course very unusual in matters of this kind of opposing ratification until after an examination by a Commission of experts. So great was the interest, that in a crowded Parliamentary Session no less than three days were given up to a Debate in which the leaders on both sides took part. As a result the Naval Prize Bill, which was intended to put the Declara-tion into effect so far as this country was concerned, Was rejected by the House of Lords, and the Declaration of London, in consequence, had not been ratified when war broke out.9. The public criticisms of the Declaration of London, as revealed by a study of the Parliamentary Debates, did not, for the most part, touch its main defects. Instead of attacking the limitation it imposed on our own power to put pressure on an enemy, most of the critics directed their denunciations against the effect it would exercise on our own supplies in time of war, or on our position as a neutral, and on a number of alleged technical defects in the instrument. These criticisms were easily met. Whether this misdirection of criticism was due to lack of knowledge and insight of the conditions of modern war, or to a natural restraint in tackling such a delicate subject as the full implications of sea power, it is impossible to say. There were, however, two exceptions to the general rule. Mr. Balfour and Mr. Bonar Law both dwelt briefly on the real ground for criticism : Balfour: &quot; Take first the argument about imported food supplies to a Continental country. There are great Continental countries which habitually import such corn as they require through neutral ports. They cannot be touched under this Declaration. You may say that, after all, they import a small fraction of their supplies, and that that fraction will be very well supplied from friendly neighbours on the Continent, and that the matter is of legal but not of practical importance. The whole trend of modern industry is to make the Western European nations more and more manufacturing countries, and therefore to make those zones in which the population is increasing more and more dependent upon overseas supplies. It is perfectly true that corn can come in, whatever you do, through these ports to Continental nations. Will any human being deny that to give them absolute security under this treaty, to make it impossible for them to have any moments of anxiety, to make it unnecessary to raise either the insurance or the freights of the neutral bottoms carrying these supplies, is to give them an advantage absolutely and formally denied to us by the same instrument ? &apos;&apos;[Parliamentary Debates.    Commons, 1911,  Vol. XXVII, Cols. 846 and 847.)Mr. Bonar Law touched the spot even more closely : Mr.. Bonar Law: &quot;Every article written on this subject by sailors has declared that the blockade in modern times is not of the value which it used to be, and that owing to the danger of submarines you cannot have a close blockade, while by this very Declaration it is impossible for vs to have a widely extended blockade, because it is not allowed to cover neutral coasts.&quot;(Parliamentary Debates.   Commons, 1911, Vol. XXVII, Col. 914.)10. Some of the reasons used by the defenders of the Declaration of London are very pertinent to the present-day controversy. We are told to-day, for example, that the United States of America will never again stand our interference with their trade as neutrals with an enemy, or at any rate with another neutral State. In private the same argument was used by the supporters of the Declaration of London in the [16812] b 2
controversies of 1910-11. In public these arguments were also used, though in a slightly veiled form, as shown by the following extracts from the Parliamentary Debates.In introducing the Naval Prize Bill on the 28th June, 1911, Mr. McKinnon Wood said : &quot; Their ideal &quot; (namely, that of naval officers) &quot; is that we should be free to act as we did a century ago in the French war. They forget what our inter-ference with neutral trade then cost us world-wide hostility and an extension of the field of war. Even then we could not maintain the licence we assumed. They do not recognise how impossible it would be to assume that licence now, with the general development of naval power and the vast extension of sea-borne commerce.&quot;Later in the Debate, Sir Edward (now Lord) Grey spoke as follows : &quot; I see two intelligent grounds of opposition to the Declaration of London which I must discuss. One is, as Mr. Gibson Bowles has said, &apos; We have no rules, we impose them; we make our own rules.&apos; The time is gone for that. If you press that you are doing something which you will not be able to carry out. You will be increasing the risk, by failing to get an international agreement, of interference with belligerents.....    I have never contended, and I have carefully abstained from contending, that the Declaration of London or the International Prize Court Convention would enable us to reduce naval expenditure; but I do say if you defeat an international agreement of this kind, which other nations are anxious to have, because you wish to keep your hands free and impose your own rules on the world if you will have no agreement with them unless you get your own way in everything because you will make no concession you will be increasing the tendency, not of one or two Powers, but of several Powers to enlarge their naval expenditure, and you will be adding to the risk that you will be interfered with in time of war by neutral Powers.&quot;11. Another argument which was used in private by the supporters of the Declaration of London was that the adaptation of the principle of blockade to modern conditions (which the writer of these notes had advocated) was really impracticable; that, so long as countries like Belgium, Holland and Denmark remained neutral, there were no means by which the passage of supplies to and from Germany could be stopped, even if there were no Declaration of London. By the time the Committee of Imperial Defence got on to this aspect of the question the Government of the day was already deeply committed to the Declaration, and the subject was never examined on any other hypothesis. In fact, Lord Desart, who had led the British Delegation at the London Conference, was the Chairman of the Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence on Trading with the Enemy, and several of the other delegates were members. That is certainly one reason why the implications of a blockade under modern conditions were not examined in greater detail before the War. We had put &quot; the cart before the horse,&quot; and had committed ourselves to the rules without studying their application, and when the study of war with Germany was made it had to be based on the new rules, notwithstanding that they were founded on a conception of naval warfare which was already obsolescent and becoming more obsolete every day.The War.12. The experience of actual war bore out in one respect the forecast of the high officer of the Admiralty, to which allusion has been made earlier in these notes; that is to say, the Declaration of London proved incompatible with the full exercise of sea power under modern conditions. But it was not jettisoned at once, and for nearly two years exercised a baneful influence on our policy. Here was a great code of International Law drawn up at an International Conference held in London under the auspices of the very Government which was conducting the war. How could it be thrown overboard at the first actual test ? How could it fail to exercise the greatest moral influence on our relations with neutrals ? Moreover, it was the only code in existence on which we and the French had ever reached agreement, and our Naval Prize Manual had been revised in accordance with its provisions. To revise the Prize Manual and to come to terms with the French would have required much time.    Consequently, though still unratified, the Declaration was tacitly
adopted at the outset of the War as the basis of our action, and the contraband lists issued at the outset of the War were in accordance with its provisions.13. Very soon, however, the Declaration began to crumble. Experience almost at once revealed its shortcomings, and public opinion would not stand this cramping of our belligerent rights. The action of the enemy, first in the indiscriminate laying of mine-fields, and later on in the adoption of the submarine campaign, provided the necessary excuse. In spite of the efforts of the enemy to force us to a return to the Declaration of London (described by Admiral voii Tirpitz as the &quot; Alpha and Omega &quot; of the German Foreign Olhce), in spite of the many protests of neutrals, and more especially of the United States of America, the measures of economic pressure were gradually tightened up until, after the lapse of two years or more, the full rigour of blockade adapted to conditions of modern warfare foreseen as necessary by some of the critics (including Mr. Ronar Law and the present writer) were applied.14. Modifications in the Declaration of London were introduced as early as the 20th August, 1914 :-&quot; In the course of a few weeks it became evident that the right to capture conditional contraband on vessels was derisory so long as supplies were permitted to flow into Germany without interruption, through neutral countries. Accordingly, an Order in Council was issued on the 20th August in which the position arrived at by consultation between the Allied Governments was defined. The position was. in effect, an acceptance of the provisions contained in the Declaration of London, with the very important modification that Conditional Contraband having an ultimate enemy destination would be liable to capture to whatever port the vessel was bound and at whatever port the cargo was to be discharged, whether in belligerent or neutral territory.&quot;(The Official History of Sea-borne Trade.   Fayle.   Chapter IV.)On the 29th October two more Proclamations modifying the Declaration of London were promulgated. The first transferred to the list of contraband a number of articles which had been on the free list in the Declaration of London, including a number of metals required for the manufacture of war material, motor vehicles of all kinds, rubber, and mineral oils other than lubricants. The contraband list in the Declaration of London had corresponded closely with the lists of the 16th and 17th centuries. That it should have included in the free list articles such as the above is a glaring example of how completely the requirements of munitions manufacture and transport in modern war had been overlooked.The second Proclamation of the 29th October, 1914, related chiefly to the treatment of conditional contraband and the circumstances in which enemy destination could be assumed. It modified articles 33, 35 and 38 of the Declaration of London. Another Order in Council of the 20th October, 1915, abrogated article 57 of the Declaration providing that the neutral or enemy character of a ship should be determined by the flag she was entitled to fly. An Order of the 30th March, 1916, made further provision for stiffening up the procedure as regards contraband, whether absolute or conditional, and, inter alia, included provisions directly contrary to article 19 of the Declaration :  &quot; By this time (July 1916) the Allied Governments had come to the conclusion that the application to warfare, under modern conditions, of the &apos; rules laid down in the Declaration of London could no longer be upheld .... So numerous and so far-reaching were the modifications now in force that little was left of the original rules, and for the purpose of avoiding friction and misconstruction it appeared better to lay the Declaration on one side and rely only on the application of principles underlying the historic and admitted rules of International Law.&quot;(Official History of Sea-borne Trade.   Fayle.   Vol. II. Chapter 20.)15. The final disappearance of the Declaration of London was effected by an Order in Council dated the 7th July, 1916. But the Declaration of London was by no means the only great international instrument affecting naval warfare to be overthrown by war experience. The greater part of the Declaration of Paris, 1856 (drawn up, like the Declaration of London, after a war-the Crimean War-in which economic pressure played only a minor part), was very early submerged by
the experience of actual warfare, and those who before the War had advocated its repudiation were justified. Similarly, the provisions of The Hague Convention forbidding the capture of enemy mail bags on the high seas had been circumvented by the subterfuge of first bringing into port the ships carrying them! It is no exaggeration to say that every International Law which was not to the mutual benefit of both belligerents was overridden, notwithstanding the protests of the injured party and so it always has been, and always will be, once unlimited warfare holds sway!16. The extraordinary difficulties which our diplomacy encountered, and the dangers we ran of interference by neutrals, especially by&quot; the United States of America, must not be underrated! Those difficulties were enormously increased, and in all probability the War was lengthened, by the haphazard way in which before the war we had entered into engagements without proper examination or the exercise of sufficient forethought and imagination. Nevertheless, by the skill of our diplomacy and the blunders of our enemy, these difficulties were surmounted. The United States had the power, if they had desired to exercise it, by escorting their merchant ships, to frustrate and paralyse our blockade. We could not have afforded to interfere with her convoys. She did not resort to this expedient, as the. defenders of the Declaration of London had insisted she might do. She might have entered the War against us. She actually joined in on our side. The difficulties of adapting blockade to modern conditions so as to put the maximum economic pressure on the Central Powers did not prove insuperable, as the supporters of the Declaration of London had insisted they would.17. In the long run the. blockade proved to be one of the most essential means for supplementing the action of the military forces in bringing the War to an end. It was the home front in Germany which broke first. Anyone who doubts the efficacy of economic pressure is referred to the extracts in the Appendix from the accounts of the War by the leading enemy figures therein.Observations.18. The chapter of history summarised above deserves to be carefully studied in connection with any fresh proposal to reopen the question of belligerent rights at sea.In the years before the War we entered on a slippery slope. The protests against the action of the belligerents during the Russo-Japanese War (which some people at the time regarded with misgiving) led to the International Prize Court Convention; the Convention to the Declaration of London; the Declaration to the verge of disaster. On the edge of the abyss we were saved from the final catastrophe of ratifi-cation by the instinct of the British people in regard to naval matters and the wisdom of the Conservative party and of the House of Lords.The arguments used to support the Declaration of London were precisely the same as those used to-day. It was said that neutrals, and above all the United States of America, would never stand the full exercise of belligerent rights. The answer given at the. time by the present Secretary to the Committee of Imperial Defence was as follows: &apos;&apos; It is extraordinary how much neutrals will endure, and instances could be multiplied to show how the Powers have allowed even their legitimate interests to be trampled on rather than go to war.&quot;We overlooked that, if our general cause was just, neutrals would stand a great deal. We overlooked our own prestige and tradition, to which Admiral von Tirpitz ascribes the fact that we were not interfered with more than we were by neutrals., We overlooked that we. might find in the action of our enemies the excuse for our own methods. When war came, America could at any moment have compelled us to give up the exercise of belligerent rights by escorting her vessels through a neutral zone, or even more easily by putting an embargo on the export of war material. The fact that she did not do so under the greatest provocation shows how false the argument was.Another argument was that, owing to modern developments of communication and international trade, we could not, in future wars, bring full economic pressure to bear on an enemy. We were never allowed to test this out, because by the time the Committee of Imperial Defence was studying the question of putting economic pressure on Germany the Government was deeply committed to the Declaration of
London. The experience of the War shows how false the argument was. Meanwhile our preparations for war were being based on false premises. The Declaration of London was their foundation, and the Declaration was based on assumptions as to naval warfare which were obsolescent at the time of the London Conference and com-pletely obsolete when the War broke out.When the War came we discovered at once how great a handicap the Declara-tion of London was&apos;. Although unratified, the Government were deeply committed to it. and it was not easy to shelve. Its retention naturally became, to use von Tirpitz&apos;s phrase, &quot; the Alpha and Omega of the (German) Foreign Office/&apos; and their diplomacy with neutrals was directed to securing its retention. We were fortunately able gradually to get rid of the Declaration on the plea of retaliation to the enemy&apos;s breaches of the laws of war. In spite of the fact that ave had not ratified the Declaration, every German writer accuses us of bad faith in advocating it before the War and throAving it over after. They have the. justification that Ave took the first step in the competition by our Proclamation of the 20th August, 1914. But it took us nearly tA\-o years finally to rid ourselves of the Declaration of London and to bring the full pressure of sea-poaver to bear. It could hardly be. contested that \ve should haare been in a stronger position if we had never taken the first step on the slippery slope to which allusion has already been made and had insisted that our action in a future war Avas too difficult for us or for anybody else to foresee and that Ave must have our hands free.The War shoaved how enormous avas the importance of sea poaver and the full exercise of belligerent rights They Avere one of the decisive factors of the War, as all the writings of our late enemy testify. It is sometimes said, as, indeed, it Avas said before the War, that there is no prospect of these circumstances ever arising again. French opinion, at any rate, seems to hold the contrary. They believe in Germany&apos;s avar of revenge. The Locarno policy may avert this, but does not the ultimate sanction of the Locarno policy, in the event of a German aggression, visualise a reproduction, so far as the position of Germany is concerned, of the Avar situation? Great Britain, France, Belgium, Italy, with possibly Poland and Czecho-slovakia, hemming Germany in! If ave deplete our armoury by Aveakening the factor of economic pressure, do we not at once deprive the sanction of part of its value? These eventualities, it is true, may never arise, or they may be postponed for an interval comparable to that Avhich elapsed betaveen the Napoleonic Wars and the Great War. This, it is submitted, is no argument for hampering the exercise of sea poAver. The Declaration of Paris, 1856, Avhich collapsed Avith the Declaration of London, avas no less -baneful because of its antiquity. Wars in Avhich sea poaver is a decisive factor are few and far betAveen, but Avhen they come the nation&apos;s existence may be at stake. For this very reason, because ave cannot see what changes the future will bring, the longest views and the utmost caution are necessary.In conclusion, it may be useful to quote avhat Lord Grey, after discussing the Declaration of London, says : &quot; One lesson from the experience of the War is that we should not bind ourselves to observe any rules of Avar, unless those who sign them with us under-take to uphold them by force if need be against an enemy who breaks them.&quot; (&quot; Twenty-five Years.&quot;   Vol. II, Chapter XXII, p. 102.)2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1, October 31, 1927.A.
Appendix.BLOCKADE.Extracts from the Writings of German Leaders bearing on its Results.1. From &quot; Out of my Life,&quot; by Marshal von Hindenburg: Chapter XVIII, entitled &quot; A Glance at the Internal Situation of the States and Nations at the end of 1917.&quot;Tn*k&apos;y- &quot; Practically the whole country was going hungry, and this not because foodwas lacking, but because administration and transport were at a standstill, and there was no means of adjusting supply to demand. No one knew how the inhabitants of the larger towns managed to exist at all. We supplied Constantinople with bread, sent corn from the Dobrudja and Roumania, and gave what help we could, in spite of our own shortage. Of course, what we delivered to Constantinople would not have gone far with our millions of mouths. If we had stopped these deliveries we should nave lost Turkey, for a starving Constantinople would have revolted, no matter what autocracy might do.&quot;&quot; Privations and want of food were to a large extent playing havoc with the troops.&quot;Bulgaria. &quot; Bulgaria also was suffering from scarcity.   Scarcity of food in a land whichusually produces more than it needs! &quot;Austria- &quot; Vienna was starving, while Buda-Pesth had something to spare.  Germanhungary. Bohemia was almost dying from exhaustion, while the Czechs lacked practically nothing. As ill-luck would have it, the harvest was a partial failure. This intensified the crisis and would continue to do so.&quot;Germany. &quot; Even apaft from the misfortunes to which I have already referred, everythingwas far from comfortable in the homeland at the end of 1917. Nothing else could have been expected, for the war and privation were a heavy burden on a large portion of the nation, and adversely affected its mcrral. A year of empty, or at any rate unsatisfied, stomachs prejudiced all higher impulses and tended to make men indifferent. Under the effects of insufficient physical nourishment, the thoughts of the great mass among us were no better than elsewhere, even though the authority cf the State and the moral resolution of the nation permeated our whole life to a greater degree.&quot;&quot; There is much that is gloomy in this picture. Not all of it was an actual consequence of the war, or at any rate need have been such a consequence. War does not only stimulate, it demoralises. And this war had a more demoralising influence than any previous war.  It destroyed not only bodies but souls.The enemy intensified the process of demoralisation, not only by his blockade and the semi-starvation it involved, but by another method, known as &apos; Propaganda in the Enemy&apos;s Camp.&apos; Not only our economic intercourse, but every other kind of intercourse with foreign countries was cut off by the blockade.&quot;&quot; Many a man in those days asked himself the significant question : &apos; How is it that our enemies abate nothing of their ruthless political demands upon us, in spite of their many military failures in the year 1917, the disappearance of Russia as a factor from the warr the unquestionably far-reaching effects of the U-boat warfare, and the corresponding uncertainty as to whether the great American reinforcements could ever be brought to the European theatre? How could Wilson, with the approval of the enemy Governments, in January 1918, propose conditions for a peace such as might be dictated to a completely beaten adversary, but which could not be put before a foe who had hitherto been victorious, and whose armies were practically everywhere on enemy soil ? &apos;This was my answer then, and it is still my answer : While we were defeating our enemy&apos;s armies their Governments and people directed their gaze steadfastly at the development of the domestic situation of our Fatherland and those of our Allies. The weaknesses which I have already described could not be concealed from them. It was those weaknesses which reinforced what seemed to us such incomprehensible hopes and resolution.&quot;
From Chapter XXIII, entitled &quot; The Last Battles of. Our Allies.&quot;&quot; In the course of the year 1918 the domestic situation in Austria-Hungary had developed along the fateful lines which I have already discussed. The exceptional difficulties with the food supply occasionally threatened Vienna with a real catastrophe. It was thus hardly surprising that the Austro-Hungarian authorities, in their anxiety to lay hands on everything available, whether in Roumania or the Ukraine, proceeded to measures which very definitely conflicted with our own interests.....It was my opinion that Count Czernin never showed us anythingbut loyal frankness, even when he was facing us with a good many surprises in the peace negotiations at Brest-Litovsk and Bucharest. There is no doubt that what he then feared was that the Danube Monarchy would never be able to survive the break-down of these negotiations, and that the cry for bread in Vienna demanded an immediate compact with the Ukraine.....&quot;From Chapter XXIV, entitled, &quot; Towards the End.&quot;&quot; A rising of the nation would not have failed to make an impression on our enemies and on our own army. But had we still enough life left in us for that? Would the mass still possess the spirit of self-sacrifice ? In any case our attempt to bring such a reserve to the front was a failure.....&quot;II. From &quot;My War Memories, 1914-1918.&quot;   General Ludendorff.(Note. General Ludendorff devotes many pages to the effect of Blockade.   Only afew extracts can be given here.)From Section entitled &quot; My Thoughts and Actions,&quot; Chapter II.&quot; But Germany always lacked one mighty means of propaganda: starvation of the enemy peoples by blockade.&quot;-From Section entitled. &quot; The Headquarters of the Commander-in-Ghief in the East at Kovno, October 1915 to July 1916,&quot; Chapter XII.&quot; At the very beginning of the war, England, in total disregard of International Law, started the war of starvation against Germany and Austria-Hungary. This strangling hunger-blockade was intended so to debilitate the body as to prepare the mind for the poison of propaganda. England had another aim: to make war against the children still unborn, so that a physically inferior race might arise in Germany. A more gruesome method cannot be imagined. England acted with inexorable consistency, as so often before in her cruel history. Step by step, and of set purpose, the English Government, by Orders in Council of the 20th August and tlie 29th October, 1914, and other economic and military decrees, suppressed all direct traffic to the German harbours, all imports through neutral countries, and even the import of the products of neutral countries into Germany.The trump card was the proclamation of the North Sea as a s War Zone &apos; on the 2nd November, 1914. The northern approaches to the North Sea were thereby completely cut off, and the neutral trading vessels were compelled to go through the Channel close to the English coast, and could then only proceed on one track right across the North Sea. And yet at the beginning of the war England had declared that she would in principle accept the convention of the Declaration of London as her standard of action. Her attitude in thexyears before the war was also quite different.With the declaration of a War Zone she had allowed it to be understood that she would no longer consider herself bound by the regulations of cruiser warfare as laid down by the Prize Courts, and also that she considered herself justified in the adoption of violent measures against traffic in the War Zone. Germany was therefore blockaded, although there was no lawful blockade. The only reason why a true blockade was ineffective, according to the rules of naval warfare, was that England&apos; was powerless to hinder traffic in the Baltic.&quot;[16812] c
&quot; By Order in Council of the 7th June, 1916, England finally abandoned the Declaration of London. In this way those principles which, despite repeated assurances no one had attempted to maintain, were formally denounced, lne violation of International Law was to be made legal and valid !     ;We in the East also felt the effects of England&apos;s continued violation of Inter-national Law In the long run it was bound to help the cause of the Entente, as the United States, both before and after her entry into the war, had given her sanction, and the neutrals of Europe were in England&apos;s power.&quot;From Section entitled &quot;First Quartermaster-General, August 29, 1916, to october 26, 1918, Chapter I.&quot; When we added to this the hatred and immense determination of the Entente, their starvation-blockade or strangle-hold, and their mischievous and lying propaganda, which was so dangerous for us, it was quite obvious that our victory was inconceivable unless Germany and her Allies threw into the scale everything they had, both in man-power and industrial resources, and unless every man who went to the front took with him from home a resolute faith in victory and an unshakable conviction that the German Army must conquer for the sake of the Fatherland. The soldier on the battle-field, who endures the most terrible strain that any man can undergo, stands, in his hour of need, in dire want of this moral reinforcement from home, to enable him to stand firm and hold out at the front.&quot;From Section entitled &quot;The Basis of Future Operations and our War Machine,&quot;Chapter IV.&quot; For the nation and the army, man and beast, the question of food supplies was of equal importance.The work of the army in the field depended to a high degree on their rations. That, next to leave, has the most decisive effect on the moral of the troops. I thus had to give the food question my serious attention.The waning moral at home was intimately connected with the food situation. In the daily food the human body did not receive the necessary nourishment, especially albumen and fats, for the maintenance of physical and mental vigour. In wide quarters a certain decay of bodily and mental powers of resistance was noticeable, resulting in an unmanly and hysterical state of mind, which, under the spell of enemy propaganda, encouraged the pacifist leanings of many Germans. In the summer of 1917 my first glimpse of this situation gave me a great shock. This state of mind was a tremendous element of weakness. It was all a question of human nature. It could be eliminated to some extent by strong patriotic feeling, but in the long run could only be finally overcome by better nourishment. More food was needed. We had to find new sources of supply, conserve our own stocks, and, above all, increase our own production.   The last was the most important.&quot;&quot; The question of illicit trading became of the greatest importance in domestic politics. It increased with the length of the war. As people at home lost interest in the war, their natural instincts, which now had nothing to curb them, were given free rein. Illicit trading and hoarding took more and more disgusting forms, and these and the declining moral interacted on one another with increasingly disastrous results.&quot;&quot; Our enemies&apos; starvation blockade triumphed, and caused us both physical and spiritual distress.&quot;&quot; The men usually did not have enough, even when they received the full ration. Besides, the food was too monotonous. I heard many complaints from the Army Commanders on this point, but I could not help in individual cases. At home, the depot troops did not get enough to eat, and this gave rise to a lot of trouble.Luxuries became rarer and rarer.Horses suffered particularly heavily, their rations being wholly insufficient. Their hard fodder ration was too small, and great difficulties were experienced with the supplies of coarse fodder;&quot; . .
Chapter VI.&quot; The strangling hunger-blockade and the enemy propaganda, which went hand in hand in the fight against the German race and the German spirit, were a heavy&apos; burden a burden that grew ever heavier as the war lasted. The blockade worked successfully. Propaganda found fruitful soil at home. It now turned its attention directly to the man at the front, who by this time was ready to give it a hearing. Blockade and propaganda began gradually to undermine our moral resolution and shake the belief in ultimate victory. The very natural longing for peace began to assume forms that bordered on weakness, led to divisions among the people and lowered the moral of the army.&quot;From Section entitled &quot; The Entente Attack, January-June, 1917.&quot;   Chapter VII.&quot; Discontent with the conditions at home, which were directly caused by the blockade, was permitted to spend its force internally, increase the effect of the blockade and disintegrate our national life.&quot;From Section entitled &quot; The Battle of Flanders and the Collapse of Russia in the Summer and Autumn of 1917.&quot;   Chapter VIII.Our economic position had also become more acute and raw materials became scarcer. -;We had managed to struggle through the food troubles, but it had been very difficult. In the winter of 1916-17 there had been no means of carting potatoes. We had to fall back on kohlrabi. At that time many people went hungry. In spring and summer supplies improved; but they had only sufficed with the aid of Rumapian wheat and maize. By early threshing on a considerable scale we might yet tide over a period betaveen the old harvest and the neav. But that meant anticipating our credit.Forage had become very scarce; grazing started early and helped a good deal. The oat harvest had been bad and the nay crop scanty. Evidently the forage problem was going to become worse.&quot;From Section entitled &quot; The Preparations for the Attack in the West in 1918.&quot;Chapter III.&quot; He (Count Czernin) said the food situation in Austria-Hungary avas so bad that, oaving to the ever-decreasing supply from Rumania, they must starve unless they obtained corn from the Ukraine. The Austrian Director of Supplies, General Landwehr, supplemented this depressing picture Avith details about the Army, and asked me if I could help. As Herr von waldoav thought, in spite of our own very serious situation, ave could still help to a limited extent, 1 could raise no objection. What I then heard appeared to me most serious, and must have made a deep impres-sion on the other gentlemen avho had to deal avith these matters.&quot;&quot; Whence avere ave to obtain the corn Avhich, according to her experts, Austria-Hungary so badly needed ? Germany could not supply it; but that is what it avould have come to in the end. Germany herself Avas extremely short; the year before she had anticipated credits by early threshing, and noAV needed extra supplies herself. Rumania aa&apos;as no longer supplying the anticipated quantity. The prospects would be still avorse if the coining harvest avere bad avith us and our allies, as well as in Rumania, avhich, as a matter of fact, experienced a complete failure. Left entirely to herself, avithout any outside help, Germany could not exist, as is proved by the great distress in the winter of 1918-19. Disaster would certainly have come avithout help from the Ukraine, even if destruction of public order had not been a contributing cause.&quot;From Section entitled &quot; The Offensive in the West, 1918.&quot;   Chapter V.&quot; The food  situation of Austria  and the Austro-Hungarian army  was uncommonly serious.   She had received her share of the Rumanian supply in. advance and used it up, and avas noAv extracting all she could get hold of from the [16812] c 2
occupied portions of the Ukraine, needless to say, without any consideration. But even this did not suffice, and, early in May, Austria, being in great need, seized grain belonging to Germany, which was being sent to us from Rumania, while it was in transit through the Dual Monarchy.&quot;&quot; In her need, Austria-Hungary had taken drastic measures, and, although she did not get anything like what Count Czernin had stated to be necessary early m February, the supplies she drew from the Ukraine, combined with our assistance, undoubtedly saved Austria and her Army from starvation. Only the most urgent needs, however, were satisfied, and even then we did not receive the bread-corn and forage so urgently required to revive the strength of our people at home. Still, the Ukraine did help Germany. In the summer of 1918 it supplied us with meat, and thus, the scanty meat-ration we had was made possible without encroaching upon our own live-stock reserves and those of the occupied territories.&quot;From Section entitled &quot; The Last Phase. Summer and Autumn, 1918.&quot;   Chapter X.&quot; G.H.Q. had occupied the Ukraine in February in agreement with the Govern-ment, the latter being then fully convinced of the absolute necessity for the step, not merely to avert the danger of Bolshevism, but also to secure the food situation of the Quadruple Alliance. In the summer, Austria-Hungary had only been kept alive with the help of the Ukraine. We in Germany had obtained from the country cattle and horses and much raw material, even if we had not had the corn we expected. The war was not over. Rumania&apos;s harvest was a complete failure. By early threshing we had had to mortgage our future again. We and our Allies had to look somewhere for additional foodstuffs, and the Ukraine was the only possible source. Without this aid, there would be a severe crisis in the early summer of 1919. The Government never cleared up tiris question of the value of the Ukraine in the autumn of 1918. Had we evacuated at this stage, which would have taken us a considerable time, we should have gradually released ten divisions, which were not really fit for tjje line. The advantages would not have been equal to the disadvantages that we should have brought upon ourselves by evacuation.&quot;III. From &quot;My Memoirs,&apos;&apos; Grand Admiral von Tirpitz.From Chapter XVII, entitled &quot; Main Issues of the War.&quot;&quot; The Entente has defeated us by means of the British ships of the line, which made the starvation blockade possible, and whose prestige yoked to England&apos;s chariot all the peoples of the world.&quot;&quot; The economic war had become the main fight, while the military front, in spite of the tremendous forces which were necessarily employed in the defensive fighting, was now the secondary theatre.&quot;&quot; Bleeding from a thousand wounds, underfed, with its back against the wall of its home, the best of German)&apos; stood fighting for its life, when suddenly the wall was overthrown from behind, and the people lost their control and fell into delirium.&quot;&quot; I do not, of course, overlook for a moment the trials to which the nerves of the masses were exposed by the starvation blockade. The mental and physical effects of this, the most cruel of all weapons of war, which it was left to the English to introduce into modern warfare, must not be underestimated; they offer, indeed, a strong excuse for the gradual weakening of the power of resistance among the people.&quot;From Chapter XIX, entitled &quot;The Submarine Campaign.&quot;&quot; And so the German people, in their unlimited capacity for belief in the foreigner, were misled by our wavering, and patiently regarded as nothing but- an act of divine ordinance the British war of starvation, which brought bankruptcy and destruction, consumption and death, to this hitherto flourishing people.&quot;
ii.MEMORANDUM BY SIR C. HURST ON SIR MAURICE HANKEY-?S PAPER ON &quot;BLOCKADE AND THE LAWS OF WAR.&quot;The thesis maintained by Sir Maurice Hankey in his paper is that no agree-ment should be negotiated with the United States on the subject of belligerent rights at sea, because an agreement would hamper this country in applying economic pressure against the enemy, and if the struggle in which Great Britain was engaged was one of vital importance to her, it would be essential to apply such pressure.2. It is no doubt true that throughout the greater part of the XINth century a belief was widely spread among the public at large that war was a struggle between the contending armed forces and not between the nations concerned. Consequently, there was a movement in favour of excluding so far as possible civilian non-combatants from the effects of the war. The idea dates back to the time of Rousseau. There is, I think, no chance of any similar delusion prevailing in the future. At present all modern States are disposed some even outwardly to organise, them-selves for defence upon the basis that the whole nation is to share in the burden. This point is one which is not without importance, as it affects the vulnerability of this country in time of war owing to the extent to which Great Britain depends upon imported seaborne foodstuffs.3. Sir Maurice Hankey traces the history of the Declaration of London in a way which suggests that the movement in favour of the. Declaration emanated from those who thought principally of the protection of Great Britain&apos;s neutral trade when other States were engaged in war, and, secondarily, of protecting Great Britain&apos;s seaborne commerce, particularly her imports, from the ravages of her enemy when she herself was engaged in Avar.  This is not correct.4. The movement avhich culminated in the Declaration of London originated with the first Secretary of the Imperial Defence Committee (Sir George SycTenham Clarke, hoav Lord Sydenham). The experiences of the South African War, and perhaps the early experiences of the Russo-Japanese War, had convinced him that the poaver to seize contraband had ceased to be of prime importance to Great Britain and thafthe risk of antagonising neutrals by belligerent seizures effected by British naval forces, coupled with the poaver Avhich it gave to an enemy to interfere Avith the commerce of this country in time of war, and also Avith the injury done to the com-merce of this country avhen a neutral by seizures by foreign belligerents, outaareighed the advantages avhich the right to seize contraband ana thereby impose economic pressure upon the enemy conferred upon this country in time of Avar. In a C.I.D. paper, Secret 41-B, of December 1904, reprinted Avith additions in April 1906, there is a memorandum by the then Secretary of the Defence Committee on the question of &quot;The value to Great Britain as a belligerent of the right of search and capture of neutral a&apos;essels,&quot; in aarhich he examines the problem at length and, after a reasoned argument of six pages of print, arrives at the. conclusion in paragraph 40 that an international arrangement under aarhich neutral bottoms covered contraband avould be to our advantage. There is in the same paper an Admiralty letter, dated the 10th June, 1905, expressing doubt upon the problem, and indicating that they avere not yet convinced. The value of this letter is that it sIioavs that the proposal raised by the Secretary of the Defence Committee must at least have been considered by the Admiralty.5. The policy then indicated must have been accepted by His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment. It avas examined at length by an interdepartmental committee appointed for the purpose of framing the instructions to the. British delegates to the Second Peace Conference at The Hague in 1907, and the recommendations of that body were in favour of international agreement for the purpose of allowing a neutraTs trade to be subject to no other restraint than the exercise of the right of visit and of effective blockade (see Report, dated the 21st March, 1907, of the &quot; Interdepart-mental committee appointed to consider the subjects which may arise for discussion at the&apos;Second Peace Conference,&quot; p. 2, paragraph 8 (6)). The members of this committee included Sir Charles Ottley, avIio avas at the time Director of Naval Intelligence at the Admiralty. It avas in pursuance of the policy originated in the Defence Committee, paper referred to above and reneaved in the report of the inter-departmental committee of 1907 that the British delegates avere sent to The Hague in 1907 to propose the total abolition of the right to seize contraband of avar, leaving
sea power to be exercised solely by means of blockade in the old-fashioned sense of the term, i.e., the blockade of an enemy coast-line. Great Britain being thus com-mitted to the principle of restricting the exercise of sea power-in time of war was naturally also in favour of curbing the pretensions of belligerent prize courts by the creation of an international prize court, which should be entitled to review the decisions of national prize courts and award compensation to those whose rights had been ignored by such national prize courts. It was for the purpose of providing this international prize court with a code of rules which it was to apply that the Naval Conference was summoned to meet in London in 1908-9 and framed the Declaration of London. Primarily, it is no doubt true that the Declaration of London was intended only as a code to be applied by the international prize court, but the whole situation was controlled by the belief that Great Britain stood to gain by the total abolition, or, if that were impossible, the restriction, of the right to seize contraband of war.6. The policy pursued in 1907 may have been right or may have been wrong. The events of the war of 1914-18 certainly suggest that the policy was wrong; but the circumstances of the war of 1914-18 were very peculiar in that at the time when the application of economic pressure to the enemy was at its highest every Power of any importance was a belligerent. From the moment that the United States came in, there was no neutral State of sufficient weight to oppose the Allied operations at sea or to oppose, the Allied measures for the purpose of securing control of enemy imports intended to reach the enemy country through neutral territory. No man, before the war, could have foreseen the situation as it emerged during the war, and it would be a bold man who would prophesy that similar circumstances will arise in any future war.7. Sir Maurice Hankey&apos;s paper seems to me to underestimate one difficulty with which British naval operations against neutral commerce must always contend in time of war, that is, that the legality of the operations will always be controlled by the prize courts, and that any action which the prize courts are pleased to determine to be inconsistent with international law will be invalidated and the Government, in the form of the captors, will be ordered to pay costs and damages. One has only to remember a case like the &quot; Zamora &quot; in 1916 (where the Privy Council held to be invalid a measure which His Majesty&apos;s Government had taken for the purpose of requisitioning neutral property and thereby increasing the economic pressure on the enemy) to see that such restrictions as the naval authorities suffered from during the late war were not all due to international engagements, whether ratified or unratiiied, by which His Majesty&apos;s Government had bound themselves in time of peace. People are apt to forget to-day the extent to which all through the late war the enemy played into our hands by the successive blunders which he committed at sea, thereby enabling His Majesty&apos;s Government to introduce all manner of novel measures under the guise of retaliation which no British prize court would have tolerated if the enemy had not made these mistakes. It is true that in time the United States came in on the Allied side, but there, again, we have to thank our enemy for the blunders which brought in the United States against them. British measures at sea for the purpose of harrying American commerce were certainly not the element which made the United States join in the struggle against Germany.8. I do not for a moment contest the view that it was by means of the Blockade that the war was won, but Sir Maurice Hankey&apos;s paper does not seem to me to state fully the case against the proposal to sound the United States as to the possibility of an agreement on the subject of belligerent rights at sea. The arguments which he marshals against the Declaration of London are not in my opinion the points of primary importance at the present stage, and the case against attempting to negotiate an arrangement with the United States as proposed in the Craigie memorandum should rest, I think, on other grounds.9. For one Power to exercise effective economic pressure upon its opponent by means of sea power two conditions must be fulfilled : (a) the Power exercising the pressure must have the superiority at sea, and (6) the measures which it takes must be measures which are Avithin the admitted principles of international law, or such as for exceptional reasons the prize court will uphold. These two conditions do not operate on a footing of equality; the first is the more essential. Unless the Power which is anxious to effect economic pressure on the enemy has the superiority at sea; it is the enemy which will exert the economic pressure and not the first Power. -If Great Britain were engaged in a naval war with a Power which was superior at sea, it is Great Britain which, by reason of her vulnerability on account of her
necessary importations of foodstuffs, would feel most the economic pressure whioh sea power can effect, and the more that the whole nation participates in the struggle and not merely the armed forces, the more precarious becomes the position of foodstuffs which theoretically are intended only for the civilian non-combatant population. Furthermore, without that superiority at sea, the neutrals would not tolerate the interference with their commerce which the exercise of sea power entails.10. The proposed agreement with the United States would only affect the second of the conditions postulated above. It is useless to make such an agreement unless it is certain that Great Britain will in the future maintain that superiority at sea which she has exercised in the past. Without that superiority sea power can and will be exercised to Great Britain&apos;s economic disadvantage.11. To what extent does superiority at sea depend on the mere multiplication of ships ? I suppose it must now be admitted that, if the United States chose to do so, they could outstrip Great Britain in any shipbuilding race in which they chose to engage. Does the problem of manning the ships built, and does the problem of sailing and fighting the ships when built and manned, so weigh down the scales against the United States and in favour of Great Britain that Great Britain could afford to ignore numerical superiority on the part of the United States and feel that she could maintain her superiority at sea despite American preponderance of ships and guns ? These are questions which no layman can answer, but they seem to me to be questions upon which His Majesty&apos;s Government must be clear in their own minds before any decision is given on the question of whether an agreement as to belligerent rights at sea would be to our advantage.12. If the question indicated in paragraph 11 is answered in the affirmative, there must be taken into consideration another question. The type of agreement contemplated in the Craigie memorandum is based wholly on the experience of the past, that is to say, it is proposed to come to an agreement as to the extent to which the belligerent practices of the late war are to be acknowledged to be in accordance with the accepted principles of international law. The problem of past wars in connection with economic pressure at sea was in reality that of the rights of neutrals. To what extent will neutrality prevail in future wars in the way that it has done in the past? To what extent will nations be entitled to appeal to the rights of neutrals? As a contrivance for the maintenance of peace the League of Nations is an attempt to organise general concerted action against a State which goes to war in breach of its undertakings. If the League were universal, there would be no neutrals. That was the hope of its founders, and the intention with which article 16 of the Covenant was drafted. The greater the extent to which the League becomes general, the greater the number of States which will have debarred them-selves and their nationals from any attempt to trade with the State against which the concerted action is being taken.13. The League has not become universal because the United States has not, and so far as one can see at present, is not likely to, become a Member, but from the point of view of naval warfare the United States is the only State now standing outside of the League which is of real importance. Spain and Brazil are likely to come back in time; Turkey, Russia and Mexico are not of first-class importance so far as concerns seaborne commerce. The problem comes back, as before, to that of the United States. At present the League is only seven years old; on the whole it is tending to become stronger rather than weaker, and there is no reason for assuming that within the Membership of the League the covenants of the League will not be enforced. Assume a war, therefore, in which there is an enemy State against which Great Britain, in collaboration with the rest of the League, is endeavouring to exercise economic pressure, and the United States is standing out and maintaining all the rights of a neutral Power.  What is the position ?14.   Every State except (a) the one against which concerted action is being taken, and (b) the United States, will be co-operating to sever all trade and financial: relations between the Covenant-breaking State and the outside world.  Consequently,. it will be bound to prevent the use of its territory for transit purposes for foreign trade with the Covenant-breaking State.   No doubt can arise as to the right of a State to control the use of its territory for this purpose.  There can be no doubt as: to the right in international law of a State to control exports from its own territory! i and to impose such conditions as it may choose upon exports from its own territory.-There can equally be no doubt as to the right of a State to control imports into and transit through its own territory, and to impose such conditions upon import and transit as it chooses.   The only neutral American trade, therefore, with the Covenant-breaking State which, if stopped or controlled by Great Britain, can give
rise to dispute is American seaborne trade transported directly to or from the enemy ports.&apos;15. -The extensions of belligerent practice which Great Britain was forced to introduce, during the late war, and as to the legality of which disputes arose, were wholly concerned with neutral trade on its. way to or from the enemy territory via the territory of other neutral States. If one can assume that the League will gradually become stronger and that its Members will fulfil the obligations of the Covenant and stop all transit trade with the enemy across their territory, the difficulty which arose during the late war will not arise in the next war in the same form, if it arises at all, as it arose in the war of 1914-18. The right of a belligerent to control neutral trade on its way to or from the enemy country when in the course of direct transportation to or from enemy ports, is a matter upon which the rules of international law are sufficiently well settled, and are adequate. It is a branch of the law in which it is unlikely that our own prize courts would tolerate unreason-able innovations. It therefore follows that if we can count on the development of the power of the League in the interval before the next Armageddon is likely to break out, this proposed agreement with the United States will be unnecessary. The existing rules of international law give us all we want16. If the proposed agreement with the United States is unnecessary, it is obvious that it is undesirable to try and negotiate it, because the attempt to negotiate it would inevitably involve great risk. The effect on the mind of the American people would prooably be to make them think that Great Britain was ready to negotiate because she was afraid of the United States and felt that she could not compete. The Big Navy party in America would exploit the situation accordingly. If the attempt to negotiate an agreement failed, the situation would be worse than before^ r*17V ---To my mind, therefore, the situation comes to this : (1.) Firstly, leaving out of account the anticipated strengthening of the League, an agreement with the United States is undesirable at the present time, - &apos; because (a) if we maintain our naval superiority as against the United States in the future, an agreement would tie our hands and prevent the exercise of economic pressure by the use of sea power, i.e., Sir Maurice Ffankey&apos;s thesis would hold good; (&amp;) if we cannot maintain our naval superiority as against the United States, an agreement of the type proposed would prevent the influence of Great Britain being used to swing the belligerent practice in the direction of what the United States have hitherto meant by the phrase &quot; the freedom of the seas.&quot; If we lost our superiority at sea, it would be to our advantage to safeguard our own imports by curtailing belligerent rights as much as possible.(2.) Secondly, if the League of Nations develops in strength, as one may at present anticipate that it will do, the problem arising from British action under article 16 of the Covenant for the purpose of severing intercourse between the outside world and the Covenant-breaking State, reduces itself to interference with American sea-borne commerce in the course of direct transportation to or from the enemy State. As regards the rights of a belligerent to interfere with this form of neutral sea-borne commerce, the rules of international law are adequate and well established and require no agreement to supplement them.18. I leave out of account one possible eventuality, namely, that the League will continue to grow in strength, and that in the next war it is Great Britain which will be the Covenant-breaking State with the whole world arrayed against her. In such a war Great Britain would never carry the Dominions with her, and it is an eventuality which need not be considered.C. J. B. HURST.Foreign Office, November 10, 1927.o
