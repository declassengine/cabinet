II.-POSITION IN CHIEF INDUSTRIES.COAL-MINING.The position in this industry worsened during. July, but an improvement took place during the succeeding two months. A considerable amount of intermittent working is still prevalent in most districts, however, and the future position of the industry is somewhat uncertain.IRON AND STEEL.In the iron and steel trades employment on the whole was not so good as in the previous quarter, the number of temporary stoppages showing a considerable increase. A slight decrease, however, occurred in the wholly unemployed figure. In the pig iron industry demand slackened somewhat with a consequent increase in unemployment, whilst in tin plate manufacture, after improvement during the first two months of the quarter, there was a marked decline during September, the position at the end of the quarter being considerably worse than at any period during the current year.SHIPBUILDING AND SHIP-REPAIRING.The improvement in employment noted in the previous quarter has been main-tained, but at a somewhat reduced rate. In most areas and particularly in Scotland there is still a fair amount of work. Repair work during the quarter has been fairly quiet, but at the North-East shipyards more employment was available during September. (ENGINEERING.There has been no appreciable change during the quarter except in marine engineering, which continued the improvement previously shown. Employment in electrical and constructional engineering, was steady and fairly good, but in the construction of motor vehicles and aircraft slackness was experienced during the quarter.TEXTILES.Cotton. Short-time working in this industry is still very prevalent and the position as a whole is worse than during last quarter. Trade remains fairly good in the Egyptian section, but poor in the American section.Woollen and Worsted. Employment remains fairly steady in this industry, but there was still a considerable amount of short time working. During September an appreciable improvement took place.Other Textiles. In other textiles the position as a whole has remained fairly constant during the quarter. - In the jute trade a fairly substantial improvement occurred during August, and the position in this industry is better than for some time past. Employment in artificial silk manufacture is good, but in the real silk trade it is unsatisfactory.BUILDING, BRICK AND TILE MANUFACTURE.Unemployment in the building trade has fluctuated considerably during the quarter, the incidence of the Housing Subsidy probably having some effect on the position. The register of unemployed painters increased considerably, but the demand for skilled workers remained good. Employment in the brick and tile industry was fair.\
CLOTHING TRADES.Employment in the clothing trades was fairly quiet during the quarter, and a considerable increase in unemployment took place during August in the tailoring trade. In the boot and shoe industry, after a large increase in unemployment during the first two months of the quarter, considerable improvement was shown during September.POTTERY.Slackness was experienced in this industry during July and August, but increased activity took place during September.TRANSPORT, DOCK LABOUR AND SHIPPING SERVICES.Employment in transport and shipping services showed some decline. Work at the docks, however, was better than during the previous quarter.
III. WORK INSTITUTED FOR RELIEF OF UNEMPLOYMENT.Numbers Employed.[See note on page 1 of November 1924 Report (CP. 541 (24)).]The table which follows has been prepared to show, so far as information is available, the number of men employed on works instituted, with financial assistance from the Exchequer or the Road Fund, for the relief of unemployment.Scope of Table. The schemes included are those undertaken by Local and other Authorities and Public Companies with a financial contribution from the State with the object of relieving unemployment; and works in respect of which guarantees have been given under the Trade Facilities Acts as capital undertakings calculated to promote employment in this country. Schemes to which State financial assistance is given, but which are not undertaken primarily for the relief of unemployment (e.g., Housing Schemes), and works put in hand by Local Authorities without State assistance are not included. Certain other schemes involving Government assistance are also excluded in view of the impracticability of ascertaining the exact number of men who are directly provided with employment thereby; these include the Export Credits Scheme and contracts for equipment, clothing, &amp;c, accelerated by Government Contracting Departments.Method of Compilation. The figures for the Road and Bridge Schemes assisted by the Ministry of Transport and for schemes assisted by the Unemployment Grants Committee are (with the exception of certain road schemes in respect of which returns are received direct by the Ministry of Transport) obtained from returns received at Employment Exchanges from Local and other Authorities and Public Companies. Those relating to schemes assisted under the Trade Facilities Acts are compiled by the Trade Facilities Act Advisory Committee from returns received from Companies to whom guarantees under the Acts have been given.Works assisted by 	Number of i\len employed at 				Sept. 24,1927J.Aug. 27,1927.

The figures take no account of the employment provided indirectly, e.g., in the preparation and transport of materials, &amp;c.t These figures indicate mea employed on the work itself. They include part only of the men employed on the manufacture of the materials used. They take no account of the labour involved in winning, transporting, &amp;c, raw materials. jNote. No distinction is now made between the Forestry Commission^ normal and relief work, and grauts for afforestation form part of the normal programme. The average number of forest employees engaged on the Commission^ operations (including Crown woods) during the quarter ended September 80,1927, was 2,940 as compared with 2,498 for the corresponding quarter of 1926.
IY. OVERSEA SETTLEMENT.(Dominions Office.)Under the Empire Settlement Act, 1922 (an Act to make better provision for furthering British settlement in His Majesty&apos;s Oversea Dominions), various schemes have been agreed with Dominion Authorities. This Act, as its title implies, is not one of the Government measures designed to deal with unemployment, and should not be so regarded.For many years before and after the war, the natural increase of population exceeded the net migration movement by about 300,000 a year, but recently the gap between the natural increase and the net migration movement has tended to diminish. During 1926, the natural increase in England, Scotland and Wales was 279,775, and the net migration movement was 103,969. Consequently, the natural increase during the year, after deducting the net migration, was 175,806.The number of persons approved for assistance and the number of departures during the months of July, August and September, 1927 (with the corresponding figures for the year 1926), and for the six months ended the 30th September, 1927 and 1926, respectively, are set out in the following Table: Quarterly Progress Return relating to Schemes approved under &quot; The Empire Settlement Act, 1922.&quot;Approval and Departure Figures.

Expenditure by Poor Law Authorities, A (England and Wales), B (Scotland).These Statistical Tables have been compiled with a view to showing the extent of the effort from public sources since the Armistice to meet the problems of Post-War Resettlement and Unemployment, and to indicate the measure of assistance provided by the Exchequer. With regard to the latter, the methods of financial co-operation are so diverse that it is impracticable to give an aggregated figure of Exchequer Assistance. For this reason, the accompanying Summary is only indicative of the extent to which the Exchequer is involved, and must be regarded as supplementary to, and not in substitution of, the detailed information given in the Tables themselves.Summary.(A.)Schemes.

The cost of the Overseas settlement free passage scheme for ex-Service men and women and their dependants (now terminated), which amounted to approximately  2,419,450, is not included in this table. Neither is the cost included of certain training of ex-Service men carried out in Ireland at a cost to the Imperial Exchequer of approximately  255,425.[16772]
Unemployment Insurance.(Estimates, Class V, Vote 7.)The National Insurance Act of 1911 provided Insurance against unemployment in certain selected industries. It was followed by the Act of 1916, which increased the numbers of persons insured, and, in 1920, by an Act of general scope which applied compulsory Insurance against unemployment fc- 12,000,000 persons. Subsequent amending &quot;Acts modified the conditions of receipt of benefit, increased contributions, provided benefit in respect of dependants, and authorised the Treasury to make advances out of the Consolidated Fund up to a limit of  30,000,000.By the Unemployment Insurance (No. 2) Act, 1924, the rates of benefit were raised (from 15s.) to 18s. a week for men, and (from 12s.) to 15s. a week for women, with 2s. (instead of Is.) a week for each young dependent child. Until the 30th June, 1926, since extended by the Act of 1926 to the 31st December, 1927, benefit in respect of contributions may be paid for 26 weeks in a benefit year, while benefit, irrespective of contributions, may be paid during unemployment subject to the satisfaction of special conditions. The Act also amends the disqualification for benefit in the case of persons affected by trade disputes, and it abolishes the right to a refund of contributions at the age of 60, subject to the payment of compensation for the loss of refund rights in certain cases.Statement of Income and Expenditure from Armistice to October 1, 1927.Expenditure                    Benefit paid         ....         ....         .... 309,763,000Appropriation for Administration   .... 30,612,000Section 9 Unemployment Insurance Act (No. 2), 1924, and Section 25-Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920 2,914,000 Miscellaneous Refunds, &amp;c............. 1,850,000Interest (Net)       ...         ....         .... 739,000Income Contributions Employers           ............ 117,340,000Employed            ....         ....         .... 105,519,000Exchequer           ....          ....          .... 80,130,000Exchequer (for ex-Service Men)      .... 3,890,000Balance of Old Fund at Armistice (excluding Interest accrued) * Employers           ....         ....         .... 5,825,000Employed           ....         ....         .... 5,825,000Exchequer           ....         ....         .... 3,884,000---     15,534,000Loans from Treasury (Net)....         ....         .... 22,660,000Miscellaneous Deposits in respect of future Contribu-tions, &amp;o.....         ............ 805,000345,878,000306,879,000* Norit.-The old Fund at November 8th, 1920, had reached a total of  22,210,000.Estimate of benefit payable from Armistice to March 81, 1928,  336,870,000.

(U.) Ministry of Transport Schemes.Road and Bridge Programme, 1919-20.To assist in the provision of employment for demobilised members of His Majesty&apos;s Forces until such time as they could be re-absorbed into industry, the Government after the Armistice inaugurated a special fund for the purpose of making grants on certain conditions to Highway Authorities for road work. The total of such grants has amounted to approximately  9,328,000 for Great Britain and it is estimated that the works carried out by Local Authorities in order to earn a grant aggregated in cost to approximately  20,000,000.Unemployment Works assisted out of the Road Fund. 1920-23 Programmes.The first &quot; Unemployment Programme &quot; proper was initiated by the Ministry of Transport in the Winter of 1920, and the following statement shows the total expenditure by the contributing parties to date and a forecast of expenditure during subsequent years, against the three programmes instituted prior to October 1923.Payments during Financial Year.

Land Settlement.In England and Wales the provision of small holdings under the Land Settle-rcent (Facilities) Act, 1919, and other Land Settlement Schemes for the benefit primarily of ex-Service men, are carried out (a) through the agency of County Councils and Councils of County Boroughs and (6) through the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries.Settlement through Local Authorities. The net capital cost of these schemes up to the 31st March, 1926, when the Land Settlement Scheme came to an end, is estimated to be  15,250,000, of which approximately  14,050,000 (net) was loaned by the Public Works Loan Board. Interest in respect of such loans is payable by Councils. Under Section 26 of the Land Settlement (Facilities) Act, 1919, the Exchequer bears the loss incurred up to the 31st March, 1926, on the Councils&apos; Small Holdings account (e.g., due to charging a fair as opposed to an economic rent), so far as such loss haa been reasonably and necessarily incurred.As from the 1st April, 1926, the Exechequer assistance takes the form of annual contributions to meet the difference between the loan charges and the estimated net income from the Councils&apos; estates. These contributions did not commence until the year 1927 and their total capitalized value cannot at present be estimated.In Scotland land settlement is not conducted through the agency of County Councils. &apos;Ministry&apos;s Settlements. Since the Armistice a number of properties have been acquired, and the capital expenditure thereon and the difference, if any, between the annual cost of maintaining and administering; them and the rents received from small holders is being borne by the Exchequer. Some of these properties have been disposed of and the net expenditure on the remainder does not involve an appreciable cash call upon the Exchequer, as additional capital expenditure is met from the surplus cash revenue or from proceeds of sale of property.Land Settlement.(A.)

Juveniles.After the Armistice, Juvenile Unemployment Centres were opened in certain localities to deal with the problem of unemployed juveniles. After a period of closure centres were, again established, and the cost, which was originally shared by the Board of Education and Local Authorities, was, from the 1st April, 1923, to the 31st March, 1924, partly met out of Relief of Unemployment Vote by grants up to 75 per cent, in respect of approved schemes, the Local Authority providing the remaining 25 per cent. From the 1st April, 1924, the Exchequer Grant was, as an emergency measure, for so long as unemployment amongst juveniles remains acute, raised to 100 per cent, of the approved out-of-pocket expenses of Local Education Authorities.From the 1st April, 1926, the Exchequer Grant was revised as follows : (1.)

If complete figures for one year ending on one of the above dates were not available, or if the Authority had not previously opened Centres, the per capita grant was fixed by the Minister on. such information, including the Authority&apos;s proposals for 1926, as was available to him.(2.)

To Authorities in whose areas the average rate of unemployment among insured juveniles was less than 3 per cent, during the year which ended on the 23rd November, 1925.Normally no grant is payable, but if in the case of a County Council the Authority can show that there are clearly defined districts where the average percentage of insured juveniles unemployed during the year was definitely abnormal, the Minister is prepared in approved cases to sanction grant as in (2) above in respect of expenditure on Centres serving these districts.In the case of approved Centres established by Authorities who are Authorities for elementary education, only grant is paid under (1) or (2) above, according to the percentage of unemployment among insured juveniles in the area of the Authority for elementary education only, provided that the proposal of the Authority has received the concurrence of the County Authority concerned.From the 1st April, 1927, the Exchequer grant is payable under terms similar to those in force for the financial year 1926, with the exception that, to qualify for grant under paragraph 1, the average rate of unemployment among insured juveniles in the area of an Authority must have exceeded 7 per cent, for the calendar year 1926. Further, per capita grants were revised so that the maximum rate of grant is 5s. for boys and 4s. Gd. for girls per week of 15 hours instruction.
