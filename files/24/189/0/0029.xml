SECRET.90CP. 489 .24).CABINET.THE JUDICIAL VACANCIES.Memorandum by the Loud Chancellor.I CIRCULATE for the information of my colleagues a Memorandum prepared by the late Lord Chancellor and circulated to the late Cabinet upon the question of the appointment of the two additional Judges (CP. 301 (24)). The late Cabinet approved the proposal to introduce Resolutions for this purpose in both Houses, and the Resolutions were accordingly put down and would have been dealt with during the Autumn Session if the proceedings of Parliament had not been interrupted by the Dissolution.Since the preparation of this Memorandum the state of business in the King&apos;s Bench Division has not improved. , It has, on the contrary, got much worse, and the appointment of the two additional Judges is rendered the more urgent by the delay which has already taken place. If the Resolutions are not put down and proceeded with before Christmas, it will be practically impossible to pass them until February or March, and thus another legal term will have elapsed with the King&apos;s Bench Division maintained at what is conceded to be insufficient strength.I therefore strongly urge that the Resolutions be put down as soon as Parliament assembles and proceeded with before Christmas. Only a Resolution is necessary, and not more than half a Parliamentary day will be required for its discussion.(Initialled) CHouse of Lords, November 13, 1924.[12265]
CP. 361 (24).CABINET.THE JUDICIAL VACANCIES.Memorandum by the Lord Chancellor.THE death of Mr. Justice Bray in March and the retirement of Lord Coleridge on the 12th October, 1923, created two vacancies upon the Bench of the King&apos;s Bench Division. But under the Judicature Act, 1910, neither of those vacancies could be filled except upon the presentation of an Address by both Houses of Parliament representing that the state of business in the King&apos;s Bench Divisiou requires it.The question now arises whether Parliament should be asked to pass such an Address and, if so, whether the Address should ask for two Judges or only one.Upon Mr. Justice Bray&apos;s death the question was considered, and it was then decided in the negative. The King&apos;s Bench Division, at the time (June 1920) when Mr. Justice Swift and Mr. Justice Acton were added to its numbers, had to face a volume of work which was unprecedented in quantity. In spite of the efforts of the Bench thus strengthened, arrears continued to grow, and it was found necessary upon the occurrence of the next vacancy again to ask Parliament to pass a resolution, and Mr. Justice Branson was appointed. By these and other measures the arrears were attacked and cleared off.There was in the spring of 1923 a decline in the number of cases standing for trial, though there was even then some indication that this decline might prove to be only temporary.Experience since that date has verified the anticipation of a renewed increase in the amount of work to be performed by the Division. The number of actions set down for trial at the beginning of the present Easter Term is almost equal to that of 1920, and more than double that of 1923 (1920, 888; 1923, 380; 1924, 861), and the number of proceedings commenced in the King&apos;s Bench Division up to the beginning of the Sittings was 17,753 this year as against 15,780 in 1923. If the figures are looked at not relatively but as they stand, they are sufficient to cause some anxiety as to whether the cases can be disposed of by the present judicial staff without leaving arrears.On a more general survey there are strong reasons for keeping the number of Judges up to the limit allowed by the Act of 1910: 1. The divorce work, though fortunately somewhat less than in the years immediately following the Armistice, remains heavy and shows an increase from 1923. On the 1st June, 1923, 594 divorce cases were pending. The number on the 1st June, 1924, was 686; 620 cases stood for trial at the beginning of Easter Sittings 1923 ; 700 at the beginning of Easter Sittings this year. But the list is heavier in comparison than it appears, for at the beginning of Trinity 1923 there were set down 11 special juries (2 of which remained undisposed of at the end of the Sittings). This year there are 18 special juries set down. The number of undefended causes set clown has risen from 327 to 380. But, in addition, the Admiralty work in the Division shows a very substantial inorease. The Admiralty list oannot be analysed beforehand with suoh accuraoy as the Divorce list oan, because actions are appointed for trial on a particular day to suit the movements of ships and witnesses. But Mr. Justice Hill estimates that there will be more than enough Admiralty to keep him very fully engaged during [11674]   [12265] b
the whole of Trinity Sittings, and that he will not during that time be able to give assistance in Divorce.It has again and again been necessary to lend a King&apos;s Bench Judge to the Divorce Court, even when both the Judges of the Division were available either for Admiralty or for Divorce. But the President of the Division is now disabled by illness from sitting, and even if the King&apos;s Bench Division lends a Judge, as is proposed, during the whole of the Sittings, the needs of the Division will not be fully met.I see no prospect that the Probate, Divoroe and Admiralty Division will be able to dispense with assistance from the King&apos;s Bench Division if it is to give a reasonably speedy trial in divorce cases and to deal punctually with Admiralty cases. The King&apos;s Bench Division now habitually gives help to the Probate Division in two ways, namely: (a.) In town, by lending a Judge or Judges to deal with divorce and Admiraltywork at the Royal Courts of Justice, and (b.) By the Eing&apos;s Bench Judges themselves disposing of divorce cases onCircuit.The trial of divorce cases on Circuit only began in October 1922. The cases to be tried on Circuit ai*e at present limited to undefended cases and Poor Persons&apos; cases, whether defended or not, and the number of towns at which divorce business may be taken is at present limited to ten. But so far the work has proceeded smoothly, and there is considerable and growing demand which I anticipate it will be necessary to meet for the enlargement both of the class of cases to be heard and of the number of towns at which they may be tried. Further, it is to be anticipated that the number of eases will increase as the country solicitors become more accustomed to the practice.The King&apos;s Bench Judges, therefore, are detained a longer time on Circuit by reason of these cases, and as time goes on the period for which they ai-e so detained will increase materially.2. It has only been possible to dispose of the heavy arrears in the King&apos;s Bench Division because by War legislation the right to a trial by jury in civil cases is largely cut down. That right has to some extent been restored, and it is proposed to restore it by the Administration of Justice Bill, which is now before Parliament, to the exact position in which it was before the passing of the Juries Act, 1918. The effect of the partial restoration which has already taken place has been considerably to increase the number of cases in which resort is had to trial by jury. Excluding commercial causes and actions for trial under Order XIV, of the cases set down for trial at the commencement of the Easter Sittings 1922, only one in every forty were jury actions, while at Easter of this year nearly one-half were marked to be tried by a jury, and at the end of those Sittings there are no less than 364 recorded for trial by jury as against 51 at the beginning of Trinity Sittings 1923; 82 at the beginning of Trinity Sittings 1922 ; 42 at the beginning of Trinity Sittings 1921, and 15 at the beginning of Trinity Sittings 1920. It is notorious that the trial of a cause with a jury takes on an average at least twice as long as a trial by a Judge alone. It was for this reason, amongst others, that the legislation restricting the right was retained in force until the arrears had been cleared off. But if, now that the arrears have been cleared off and jury trial has again become popular, the judicial strength is allowed to fall, the result must be a fresh accumulation of arrears.3. Nothing could be more uneconomical than to allow arrears to accumulate once more. The existence of arrears is in itself a denial of justice, but, in addition, it has the immediate effect of reducing largely the revenue of the Court. If speedy trial cannot be obtained in the Courts, litigants will have recourse to arbitration, and when business has once been lost, experience shows that it is extremely difficult to bring it back again. Meanwhile, the main expense of the Courts goes on at the same figure. The building itself cannot be reduced in size or devoted to other purposes. Trained clerks cannot be improvised at a momenfs notice. The standing charges thus remain the same, while the revenue which they earn falls off. The cost of a Judge is limited to the amount of his salary and that of his clerk, a total of . 5,400 a year less tax a very small percentage upon the total turnover.4. One&apos; of the expedients resorted to in order to deal with arrears has been the appointment of Commissioners to take the place of Judges on Assize and thus set
[11674]them free for work in London. This expedient is very unpopular in the country. Litigants on Circuit consider, with some justice, that they are entitled to the services of what they call a &quot; red Judge.&quot; And the practice works unevenly in different parts of the country. In Lancashire and Yorkshire, where on the whole the heaviest class of case comes to be tried on Circuit, and where also are the heaviest lists of criminal matters, there is special dissatisfaction. By immemorial custom, which it is impossible to ignore, the Judges choose their Circuits in order of seniority. The Northern and North-Eastern Circuits, which involve the longest continuous absence from London and which comprise the less agreeable places of residence, are there-fore left for the junior Judge, or, where a Commissioner is sent, for the Commis-petitioner. These Circuits, therefore, which are the most important as regards the volume of work, have again and again to content themselves with the visit of a Commissioner instead of a Judge.In considering the cost of now appointing an additional Judge, there must be set off against the gross figure of  5,400 mentioned above, the cost of the Commissioner who will necessarily be employed if &quot;such a Judge is not appointed. In the financial year 1922-23,  1,242 was spent on fees to Commissioners, and in the financial year 1923-24,  3,102 was spent on the same object.5. The autumn and winter are the critical periods of the legal year. During that time the Courts not only feel the effect of the work which the solicitors have been able to prepare for trial since the end of the Trinity Term, but are depleted by the absence of most of the judicial staff on Circuit. There are periods during these months when not more than two Judges of the King&apos;s Bench Division are available for work in London, and any accident, such as the temporary illness of a Judge, or an unexpected rush of work on Circuit, or a lengthy trial at the Old Bailey, may leave the Royal Courts of Justice without more than one King&apos;s Bench Judge, to the great inconvenience of the public.6. The work of the Railway and Canal Commission is at present unusually heavy. By Statute a King&apos;s Bench Judge assigned for the purpose is Chairman of that Commission. Great difficulty has been found during the past year by the King&apos;s Bench Judge occupying that position in finding enough time for his duties.7. The judicial staff at present can only get through its work by accumulating substantial arrears, even if all the members of the Judicial Bench are always available for their duties. But, as1 already observed, the President of the Probate Division is ill, and it is improbable that he will be available again until after the Long Vacation, when .abnormal arrears may be expected to have accrued in his Division. Mr. Justice Salter is also seriously ill, and it is uncertain when he will return to duty; and there is a growing disposition to utilise the services of Judges for extra-judicial work. At the moment Mr. Justice Talbot is engaged upon the Syme enquiry, Mr. Justice Swift is needed from time to time on the Aliens Committee, and there is a prospect of other demands being made. Furthermore, Mr. Justice Astbury, of the Chancery Division, is ill, but no Judge can be lent from the King&apos;s Bench Division to take his place because no one is available, and there must have been a breakdown in that Division but for the voluntary offer of service made by Lord Buckmaster.8. The Lord Chief Justice, upon whom rests the duty of the management of the King&apos;s Bench work, has expressed to me in the strongest terms his view that the circumstances are such as not only to justify an application to Parliament, but to render that course a plain duty. But there is, in addition, a strong feeling among the King&apos;s Bench Judges generally whose knowledge and experience are valuable in these matters iu favour of again raising the judicial staff to its full number.For these reasons, I suggest to my colleagues that an Address should be moved in both Houses, under the Act of 1910, for the appointment of two additional Judges in the King&apos;s Bench Division. I do not anticipate any serious opposition in the House of Lords; it is probable that, in the House of Commons, the motion will have the support of the ex-Law Officers.I attach an Appendix giving the history of the matter.H. of C.House of Lords, June 25, 1924.
APPENDIX.BEFORE the reign of Richard III the numbers of the Judges of each of the three Courts of Common Law varied from time to time, and there was no attempt to maintain an equality of numbers in each Court. Under Richard III The Court of King&apos;s Bench had one Chief Justice and two puisnes. The Common Pleas had one Chief Justice and three puisnes. The Court of Exchequer had one Chief Baron and three puisnes.Henry VII added an additional Judge to the Common Pleas and Henry VIII maintained these numbers. Under Edward VI, Mary and Elizabeth each Court had one President and three puisnes.James I added one puisne each to the Eing&apos;s Bench and the Common Pleas, but he reduced the King&apos;s Bench again to four, and Charles I made a similar reduction in the Common Pleas.Thus in the latter reign the establishment was fixed at one President and three puisnes for each Court, and these numbers continued until 1830, when, by 11 Geo. IV and 1 Wm. IV, cap. 70 (the Law Terms Act, 1830), an additional Judge was appointed to each Court, making a total in each Court of one President and four puisnes.In 1868 the Parliamentary Elections Act, 1868 (31 &amp; 32 Viet., cap. 125), transferred the trial of election petitions from the House of Commons to the Judges of the Courts of Common Law, and, by section 11 (S) and section 55, authorised the appointment of an additional Judge to each of the three Courts.Accordingly, upon the 25th August, 1868, Hayes, Brett and Cleasby were appointed respectively to the Courts of King&apos;s Bench, Common Pleas and Exchequer, making the strength of each Court one President and five puisnes.The next alteration in the number of the Judges of the Courts of Common Law followed upon the operation of the Judicature Acts of 1873 and 1875 and of the Appellate Jurisdiction Act, 1876. The Acts of 1873 (except sections 20, 21 and 55, which relate to the Court of Appeal proposed to be constituted under the Act of 1873 and to appeals to it and to the House of Lords) and 1875 came into operation together on the 1st November, 1875. Sections 20, 21 aud 55 of the Act of 1873, so far as they came into operation at all, did so together with the Appellate Jurisdiction Act, 1876, on the 1st November, 1876.As the Act of 1875 amended the Act of 1873 before the latter had come into operation, and the Act of 1876 amended both those Acts before the appeal section of the former had come into operation, it is difficult to- state concisely what their effect (so far as material to the present matter) was. It may perhaps best be summarised as follows : The Act of 1873 contemplated that the permanent establishment of the High Court should be twenty-one Judges, that is to say, four Chancery Judges (one Master of the Rolls and three Vice-Chancellors), two Judges of the Probate, Divorce and Admiralty Division, and fifteen Judges of the Common Law Courts (Lord Chief Justice of England, Lord Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, Lord Chief Baron and twelve puisnes -four in each Division with a power by Order in Council to reduce the number of Divisions of the High Court and abolish the offices of Chief Justice, Master of the Rolls, Chief Justice of the Common Pleas and Chief Baron of the Exohequer).*This involves the reduction of the Common Law Judges (Presidents and puisnes taken together) from eighteen to fifteen ; and section 5 of the Act of 1873 accordingly provided again in somewhat obscure words that new appointments should not be made until the number of the Common Law puisnes had been* The words used (see section 82 of the Act of 1873) are so obscure as to bo almost incomprehensible. Tho intention no doubt was to give power to morgo tho Common Law Courts all together aud to have only one Chief Justice instead of two Chief Justices and one Lord Chief Baron, but not, so far as this section is concerned, to reduce the number of Judges.. It may bo that the extreme partisans of fusion contemplated eventually a High Court in which there would not. be any Divisions at all.
t- 5reduced below twelve. Before this provision for reduction came into operation section 3 of the Act of 1875 supervened. That section, after reciting the provisions of section 5 of the Act of 1873, recited that, &quot; having regard to the state of business in the several Courts.....it is expedient that the number of Judges thereofshould not at present be reduced,&quot; and repealed the provision.Thus, when the Act of 1875 came into operation, there were in office eighteen Common Law Judges (Le., two Lord Chief Justices and one Lord Chief Baron, and five puisnes in each Division).The Act of 1875 made fundamental alterations in the arrangements for appeals from the High Court proposed by the Act of 1873. The earlier Statute (see section 6) had contemplated a Court of Appeal comprising besides the Lord Chancellor, the Lord Chief Justice of England, the Master of the Rolls, the Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, and Chief Baron of the Exchequer (who were to be ex-officios) &quot; so many ordinary Judges (not exceeding nine at any one time) as Her Majesty shall from time to time appoint.&quot; The first ordinary Judges were to be the then existing Lord Justices of Appeal in Chancery (James and Mellish), the then existing salaried Judges of the Judicial Committee appointed under the Judicial Committee Act, 1871 (34 &amp; 35 Viet. cap. 91), who were four in number/ and such three other persons as Her Majesty may be pleased to appoint by Letters Patent.&quot; The Court of Appeal thus constituted was to exercise, in place of the House of Lords, the jurisdiction of that House in appeals from England.The Act of 1875, on the other hand, left the jurisdiction of the House of Lords as an appellate Court where it was before the Act of 1873 passed. It constituted the Court of Appeal as a Court intermediate befween the High Court and the House of Lords. It was to consist of the five ex-officios mentioned above and three ordinary Judges, who were to be the two Lord Justices of Appeal in Chancery, and &quot; such one other person as Her Majesty may be pleased to appoint by Letters Patent.&quot; Sir Richard Baggallay, then Solicitor-General, was appointed to the Court of Appeal under this power.The Appellate Jurisdiction Act, 1876 (39 &amp; 40 Viet., cap. 59), authorised the appointment of three more &quot; ordinary Judges of the Court of Appeal,&quot; and it directed that the first three appointments were to be made by the transfer to the Court of Appeal of three Judges of the High Court, and that the vacancies so created in the High Court &quot; shall not be filled up except in the event and to the extent hereinafter mentioned&quot; (see section 15). The Judges so transferred were to be taken from the three Common Law Divisions, from amongst Judges who had held office for not less than two years, and the Judges so transferred were laid under an obligation to go Circuit in the same manner as if they were Judges of the High Court.In execution of this power, Bramwell B., from the Exchequer, Brett J., from the Common Pleas, and Amphlett B., from the Exchequer, were transferred to the Court of Appeal. The condition imposed by section 15 upon the filling up of the vacancies so created is described later in this memorandum. It is enough to say here that it was not fulfilled immediately, and accordingly the vacancies created by these appointments to the Court of Appeal were not filled up. At the same * time, however, another vacancy was created in the King&apos;s Bench Division by the appointment of Mr. Justice Blackburn to be a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary under the Act of 1876. Hawkins was appointed to the King&apos;s Bench Division in Blackburn&apos;s place and immediately transferred to the Exchequer Division, his place in the King&apos;s Bench Division being left unfilled. The vacancy in the Common Pleas and the other vacancy in the Excheqiier Division were left unfilled. Thus the Common Law Judges were reduced in number to fifteen (three Presidents and twelve puisnes), but three of the Lords Justices remained liable to perform some of the duties which would naturally fall upon the Judges of the High Court.In practice it was found that the obligation to go Circuit resting upon three of the Judges of the Court of Appeal could not be fulfilled without dislocating the arrangements of that Court. The result is that the number of Judges available to perform the ordinary work of the Common Law Courts has remained ever since below that contemplated as neoessary in 1876. As will appear hereafter, measures have from time to time been taken to increase the judicial strength, but these were rendered necessary in each case by the then state of business on the Common Law side.* Sir Barnes Peacock, Sir Montague Smith, Sir llobert Collier, Sir James Colvile.
In the autumn of 1880, Cockburn, Lord Chief Justice of England, and Kelly C.B. died, and advantage was taken of the vacancies thereby created to take action under section 32 of the Act of 1873. On the 16th December, 1880, by an Order in Council which came into operation on the 2Gth February, 1881, the Common Pleas and Exchequer Divisions were united in the King&apos;s Bench Division, and the offices of Chief Justice of the Common Pleas and Chief Baron were abolished. Coleridge, then Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, was appointed Lord Chief Justice of England, and two puisnes were appointed in the place of the two Presidents. The number of Common Law Judges, therefore, was still fifteen, namely, the Lord Chief Justice and fourteen puisnes.The &quot;event&quot; and &quot;extent&quot; to be &quot;hereinafter mentioned,&quot; as indicated in section 15 of the Act of 187(5, are described in section 18 of that Act, which is as follows: &quot;Whenever any two of the said paid Judges of the Judicial Committee of-the Privy Council have died or resigned, Her Majesty may, upon an address from both Houses of Parliament representing that the state of business in the High Court of Justice is such as to require the appointment of an additional Judge, fill up one of the vacancies created by the transfer herein-before authorised by appointing one new Judge of the said High Court in any Division thereof; and, on the death or retirement of the remaining two paid Judges of the said Judicial Committee, Her Majesty may, upon the like address, fill up in like manner another of the said vacancies, and from time to time fill up any vacancies occurring in the offices of Judges so appointed.&quot;Sir James Colvile died on the 6th December, 1880, and Sir Robert Collier on the 27th October, 1886, and thereby a power arose to make an appointment under section 18, if such an address as that section contemplated were passed. No such action, however, was taken. Sir Barnes Peacock died on the 3rd December, 1890, and Sir Montague Smith on the 3rd May, 1891. But it was not until 1899 that any action was taken under the section. In that year Farwell J. was appointed to the Chancery Division. In 1907 Coleridge was appointed to the King&apos;s Bench Division, also under that section, and the number of the King&apos;s Bench Division thereupon became sixteen one Lord Chief Justice and fifteen puisnes.In 1910, the Supreme Court of Judicature Act, 1910 (10 Edw. VII and 1 Geo. V), authorised the appointment of two additional Judges of the High Court. These Judges were to be attached to the Kings Bench Division, but it was provided that, whenever after the 1st August, 1911, the number of puisne Judges of the Division amounted to fifteen or more, a vacancy should not be filled up except upon the presentation of an address from both Houses &quot; representing that the state of business in the King&apos;s Bench Division requires that such vacancy should be filled.&quot;The Act came into operation on the 26th July, 1910.Walton J. died on the 25th September, 1910, and Jelf J. resigned before the end of the Vacation. To fill these vacancies, and in execution of the Act of 1910, Bankes, Avory, Horridge and Lush JJ. were appointed Bankes to Walton&apos;s vacancy, Lush to Jelfs vacancy, and Avory and Horridge to the two new Judge-ships.   The number of puisnes thus became seventeen.Grantham J. died on the 30th November, 1911, and no appointment was made in his place, the number being thus reduced to sixteen.Lawrance J. resigned in March 1912, and no new appointment was made in his place, the number being thus reduced to fifteen.Hamilton J. was appointed to the Court of Appeal on the 1st October, 1912, and Rowlatt was appointed in his place, retaining the number at fifteen.On the 1st November, 1912, an address having been presented under the Act of 1910, Bailhache was appointed, bringing the number to 16.On the 30th May, 1913, an address having been presented under the Act of 1910, Atkin was appointed, bringing the number to 17.On the 21st October, 1913, Phillimore J. was appointed to the Court of Appeal, and no new appointment was made in his place, the number being thereby reduced to sixteen.In February 1914, Bucknill J. resigned, and no new appointment was made in his place, the number being thereby reduced to fifteen.On the 28rd April, 1914, Channell J. resigned and Piokford J. was promoted to

In pursuance of Cabinet Minute 37 (27)  dated 29th June 1927 the Commissioners of Crown Lands through the Ministry of Health approached the London County Council in order to ascertain whether they would be willing to purchase at least a portion of the Albany Street Estate with a view to carrying out a housing scheme there. ,The Council, however, are so fully occupied with other housing schemes which in their opinion and, it is understood, in the opinion of the Ministry of Health are much more urgent, that they are not prepared at the present time to entertain the proposal.The Commissioners thereupon endeavoured to persuade the prospective purchasers, introduced by Sir Howard Frank,  to bind themselves to undertake the provision Cjf; accommodation for at least two thirds of the present working-class population, but without success.    A sale of the estate at the price offered, viz:  750,000 - 800,000, would thus reduce the net revenue from Crown Lands by more than  15,000 a year, without the compensating advantage of relieving the Commissioners and indirectly the Government from the moral responsibility of rehousing the population.In these circumstances I consider that the right policy is to take no further action for the present, and I have informed Sir Howard Frank that the instructions given to him to find a purchaser are withdrawn.K  G.^istry of Agriculture and Fisheries.
