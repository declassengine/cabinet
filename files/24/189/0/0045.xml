 IS DOCUMENT IS THE HROFERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT.1.     The unemployment position in Coal Mining is again attracting attention, and constant representations are reaching me as to the seriousness of the situation in South !?ales and Durham.   My own belief Is that.the peak of unemploy-ment in the industry has been passed, and that the situation will now gradually improve.     But, as is   always the case in such matters, public attention, inactive before, has now become focussed on the question.     Moreover, even though the figures of unemployment are less, the continued duration ftf it in some black spots in which it exists in an accentuated form is likely to cause a degree of despair which might lead to some regrettable incidents.     Moreover, the state of affairs is being used for purposes of propaganda as indicative of the failure and indifference of the Government. 2.     Further, I believe that the situation will yield to treatment if applied on sound lines.   The danger is that the situation is out of perspective.     The limits of the reme-dial action that any government could take are either not understood or not acknowledged.   This leads to the creation of false hopes and expectations, and the longer these continue the more difficult and expensive will be their removal.     A large measure of the difficulty and expense would inevitably fall upon the Government.3V     It is important, therefore, that any statement of the Governments position should Include (l) a review of the general situation and (2) an account of such alleviating action as the Government is taking or is prepared to take.    In several districts the more responsible leaders and the moreCABIN E T.UNEMPLOYMENT IN THE COAL MINING INDUSTRY.Memorandum by the Minister of Labour.BRET.?\295(2f7) .Copy No.
s^r^Lous-mixided -workmen, are looking for a lead from the Government and for an Impartial appreciation of the outlook. The statement would have to show what the Government cannot do, as well as what it can and will do.   The first part woulfi consist mainly of references to conditions and plans within the control of the industry, matters such as amalgamation, co-ordinated selling, &amp;c.I suggest it is of real importance to make It clear that a settlement of these matters must depend primarily upon steps taken hy those within the Industry, and that, in any case, too much effect cannot be expected from thorn in the immediate future.   They may make trading more profitable, but it will be some time before that reacts upon the volume of trading and of employment.     Moreover, the immediate effects of steps for re-organisation of this nature, as is constantly the case with Socialist demands, are adverse to the workers in the industry.    In other words, they would tend to lead to more rather than less unemployment in the coal trade at the moment.4.     There then arises as the immediate problem the question of the extent to which the Government can ease the position of the men now unemployed.     This concerns the Ministry of Labour from the point of view of unemployment insurance, and the Ministry of Health from the point of view of the financial position of the Local Authorities in the black areas. 5.     The seriousness of the unemployment position in coal mining lies in its concentration rather than its oxtent. Out of 223,000 registered as unemployed, approximately 90,000 are on short time, and between wages and unemployment benefit are, for the most part, earning enough to make both ends meet. The wholly unemployed are approximately 130,000.    Proportionately to the insured population in the industry this rate of unemployment is not higher than other industries have
experienced and if the unemployment were more evenly distributed over tne coalfields the situation would not arouse the same comment.     3ut 70/e of the wholly unemployed are in the South Sales and Northern coalfields (mainly Northumberland and Durham); there are bad patches in Lancashire which may become worse, also in Lanarkshire and East Fife, and, to a much smaller extent, in the Forest of Dean.     South Wales and the Northern field are the &quot;black areas,6.        There are three main objectives in attacking the problem:-(A)   A general improvement within the industry. (3)   The disintegration of the concentrated unemployment. (C)   The avoidance, while (A)  and (3) are operating,of a sudden breakdown of the Local Authority in any of the bad areas.7. I do not make any comment at this stage upon the first question:    i?e have taicen the view that the general improvement within the industry is a matter almost entirely for the industry itself, as*d that no compulsory measures thet the Government could, in practice, introduce would be able to alter the position immediately.The disintegration of the conoentrated unemployment is the present objective of the Ministry of Labour,  and I think the steps we are taking might well be intensified.     The chief hope of relieving unemployment in the industry lies in the absorptive power of other industries.     For this power to operate, however, two conditions are necessary.      First, the other industries must   themselves be in a fairly prosperous state, and, second, the miners must be brought into touch with those other industries.   The plans I am developing for dealing with this problem are as follows(a) Section 18 of the alining Industry Act, by an agreement betvraen the Ministry and the tiining Association
preserves all colliery vacancies for workpeople over 18 years of age for persons already in the industry.     The agreement is being generally observed, though in the present state of the Industry it is not possible to say what its nett result is upon the figures of unemployment.     But under It transfers of men from the Northern coalfield to other coalfields are taking place and there is also a certain drift of workers away from the coal industry to other industries.   I propose to use the Employment Exchange machinery to facilitate this kind of transfer so far as is practicable.   So far, for various reasons, the drift away from South wales has not been so pronounced.(b)    In addition to the movement within the industry and the absorptive capacity of other industries, &quot;disintegration&quot; oan be helped by oversea migration.     The Ministry of Labour Training Centres at Brandon and Claydon are being doubled and will next year be able to give training to 2,000 single men for settlement oversea.    Miners are eligible for this training and it is hoped that many of them will apply.    If Claydon and Brandon prove insufficient and the Dominions could take additional men,^additional accommodation could be provided, Out there is a difficult &quot;bottle-neck&quot; caused by the inadequate response by the Dominions, particularly Australiat(c) The process of disintegration could be speeded up by the establishment of one or more additional training centres like the Ministry&apos;s 1 handy-men training centres at Birmingham and Wallsend, for teaching young unemployed men the use of tools and shop discipline, with a view to improving their ohances of absorption in other trades.
(a)    For unemployed juveniles (in respect of whom a very grave situation is developing in South Wales and in Durham J T provision already exists for the establishment of Juvenile Unemployment Centres in areas where unemploy-ment is heavy and I am arranging to increase at once the facilities in the worst districts.     I propose also to try (by utilizing the Employment Exchange machinery) to turn the minds of the boys and girls - and of their parents - to trades other than ooal mining and to endeavour to arrange for their transfer to districts like the Midlands where opportunities for juvenile employment are more favourable. 8.     The &quot;interim&quot; period raises difficulties of another kind. It is imperative, not only for the suooess of the Blanesburgh Unemployment Insurance Bill, but for the future of a contributory insurance scheme, that the &quot;30 contributions condition&quot; should be an accepted faot.     The condition will not affect miners appreciably for the next two years. Undoubtedly at the end of that time a number of miners, in common with a number of men from other industries, will fail to qualify, but the condition is worthless unless it is to have some meaning.     Already it stretches the principle of contributory insurance very far.     There is no reason to suppose that the number of miners affeoted at the end of the two years transitional period will be large or that they will be cases that ought properly to be carried by the Unemploy-ment Insurance Scheme.     The younger men in the industry, who are more likely to make good in other industries, must be forced to oonsider the question of a change, while all help possible in the c.irection of finding other jobs will be given them by the Employment Exchange service.
In the meantime relief will be afforded, both to the Guardians and to the administration of the Unemployment Insurance Scheme, by the new Old Age Pension arrangement, under whioh, from End January next, the qualifying age for the pension is lowered to 65.9,     At the same time, political difficulties of a practical kind will arise if the burden of disqualification falls too suddenly upon small looal Authority areas whose finances are already strained by the difficulty of collecting rates when the chief ratepayer (the colliery oompany) is out of action.She Ministries of Health and Labour will therefore jointly keep a olose watch upon the position developing in eaoh of the looal Authority areas likely to be affected. Neither Ministry oan afford a financial breakdown of the Local Authority,     It is important to both that some economio pressure should be brought to bear on the miners, particularly the younger miners, to move^?Se**area, and no encouragement should be given to the idea that a young miner disallowed benefit under the insurance scheme is of necessity an immediate charge on Poor Law, or that the burden of poor Law will be relieved by special grants.10.    I feel sure the Cabinet will approve the administrative steps I am taking - not in any instance affecting large numbers of men or boys, but having a useful cumulative effect. I cannot, however, extend my arrangements for giving some form of training to the young unemployed miners (perhaps the most diffioult olass of all) unless I am provided with further funds.     There need not be a large increase over the present provision and it would in its nature be of a purely temporary character-,(Intd. ) A. S-M.Ministry of Labour. 2Srd November, 1987.
