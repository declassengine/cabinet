Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1927.CONFIDENTIAL. Copy No.    30CP. 280 (27).[A 6469/361/45]RELATIONS BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA and canada.SIGNS are not wanting that the two great water power questions which are at present active between Canada and the United States, namely, the proposed Great Lakes-Saint Lawrence waterway, so dear to the heart of the United States, and the excessive diversion of water from Lake Michigan through the Chicago sanitary canal, are giving rise to a certain irritation between the two countries. As regards the Great Lakes-Saint Lawrence waterway, fears have been expressed in Canada that the plan put forward by the United States Government and known to be warmly supported by Mr. Hoover might well result, if carried out, in attempts on the part of the. United States to exercise jurisdiction over those portions of Canadian territory through which the proposed waterway would run. That these fears on the part of Canada have caused some concern in Washington seems to be indicated by the fact that Mr. Phillips, the United States Minister at Ottawa, recently delivered in Toronto a lengthy address in which, inter alia, he expatiated at length upon the advantages to be secured by the waterway and the friendly intentions of the United States. It does not appear open to doubt that this speech was delivered upon instructions from Washington, and it has caused some perturba-tion in Canada, Mr. Phillips being strongly criticised by several organs of the press for appealing to the Canadian people over the heads of their Government.The Chicago drainage question has now been active for a number of years, and little or nothing has been done by the United States Government to check the diversion of water from Lake Michigan, the result being that the level of the lake has fallen no less than 6 inches. Recently, the Canadian Government suggested through the Legation in Washington that the extensive correspondence on this question between the two Governments concerned should be published. At first the United States declined, but subsequently, under further pressure, yielded, and in doing so. addressed to the Canadian Legation a note obviously drafted with a view to its effect on public opinion in the United States rather than as an effort to answer the arguments of the Canadian Government. The question is now as far from solution as it ever was.A.  C.Foreign Office. November 12, 1927.4195   [16814]
