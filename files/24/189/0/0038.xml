We could either (l) offer further concessions to King Jeisal with a viev; to keeping the negotiations alive,  or (2) face the fact that a new agreement is impracticable and allow matters to take their course.(/ Cabinet 56 ( 27), Conclusion 5. -I-
As regards the former alternative, it would seem that only the nominal recognition of &quot;complete independence without qualificetaon,would satisfy tho Zing.     The objections are obvious.    The &quot;independence&quot; of Iraq has already been recognised in Treaties and other documents. But the King prosses for the word :&apos;complete&quot; which, it is held, might be xmaeeeptable to the league of nations and goes altogether beyond the facts of tho case.     In any case, if the point is to be sulphuric?rendered, it could only bo in return for complete acceptance by Iraq of our views in regard to advice..     If the second alternative is adopted, we fall back without difficulty upon the existing treaties, etc.    But, in the first place we lose the chance of a treaty some portions of which, a.t any rate, would continue in force even after Iraq had entered the league of nations and would thus regulate Anglo-Iraqi relations for an indefinite period.     This is a point to which I know that Mr. Anery attaches a great deal of importance.     In the second placo, various difficulties are likely to follow EIng j?lesalrs return to&apos;Iraq in a discontented mood&quot;, and the High Commissioner warns us that, given those conditions, ho could not contemplate the furthea? reduction of the British Garrison which had been proposed.   It is for the Cabinet to decide between the two alternatives.If the second alternative is followed, it is desirable that the failure to conclude a new troaty should be presented tc the public both hox&apos;s ancl in Iraq in the least unfavourable light.    The question of responsibility for the defence of Iraq affords a convenient peg on which to hang a suitable announcement.     This
question may &quot;be said to be the seed from which all the difficulties in regard to treaty revision sprang..   It was the British Governments decision last year that Iraq must accept, as from August 1928, full responsibility for her own defence that first gave King Poisal the pretest for raising the question of conscription and demanding political concessions from us in order to render conscription palatable..     It has nov; been recognised that we shall have to continue our military support to Iraq after 1928 and King Peisal has been so informed..   It is therefore possible to argue that the basis upon which the treaty discussions were inaugurated has been wholly modified and consequently that the need for their continuance has disappeared.   King i?feisal has himself suggested that the public announcement on the subject should take this form.       A draft announcement on these lines is appended.Colonial Office,21st November, 1927.
NOTE ON RESULTS OF THE BREAKING DOWN OP K5C-OTIA3?IOU3 V/cessation IRAQ, FOR A KKE.&apos; TREATY.By S.tr Hem-y Dobbs, High CoramissJonor for1.     The present crisis was inevitable, Its seeds having been sown in two provisions of the Anglo-Iraq Treaty of January, 1926, vis;: (a) that His Britannic Majesty- s Government would in 1928 take into active consideration the question of the entry of Iraq into the League of Nations and the consequenttermination cf the Treatyj    (b) that Iraq should accept ......   .not later than the year 1928 full military and financial responsibility for the preSKvaticnof internal order and for the defence, of Iraq against foreign aggression (vide paragraph 3 of Explanatory Note attached to Treaty of January, lS2So)King Feisal and a large section of Iraqi politicians had based upon thr-se two provisions a confident hope that in 1928 British control would be conspicuously or even completely relaxed, while they would continue to enjoy the benefits of a British alliance.     Great Britain, they thought, would be willing to continue her alliance in order to retain her general influence In Iraq.      They reasoned that after the acceptance by Iraq in 1928 of complete responsibility for her finances and for her defence and internal security, Great Britain could not pretend to retain responsibility for, or control of, internal policy, and would be forced by circumstances to get Iraq into the League and to terminate her responsibilities and tutelage undertaken by the existing Treaty.     They relied also on tho assurance given by Kr. Winston Churchill in October, 1922, that nas soon as the frontiers were settled, and a stable Government set up in accordance with the organic laws His Majesty&apos;s Britannic Government would use their good offices to secure admission of Iraq to the Leaguet     King Feisal rightly
wished that discussions as to this anticipated change in relations should begin in 1927; and his wish coincided with the desire of His Britannic Majesty1s Government.2.     On the request of the Colonial Office I opened the discussion in my secret despatch dated 24th March, 1927, (circulated to the Cabinet) In which I strongly pressed for admission of Iraq into the League in 1928, mainly on the ground that &quot;thingc cannot stay as they are, the admission of Iraq being deferred, because the present quiet and contentment is due mainly to the confidence of Iraqis that we shall press for her early admission.     The politically minded classes, inclviding the King, would be alienated if we now decided not so to press&quot;, and difficulties similar to those which we have had in India and Egypt would appear in Iraq&quot;.     If now this rapid process of release from tutelage were checked and they suddenly lost the hops of early enfranchisement, I am convinced that the whole political atmosphere would change and that Great Britain would soon experience in Iraq the same dreary disillusionment which she has had to bear in India and Egypt.     For the political classes do in truth count far more heavily in power for mischief than do the solid clasoes in po^er for tranqxiility.     In no long time the stxidents -jould be striking and parading, the King and his Ministers suspicious and intriguing against us, the lawyers plotting assassinations and the Iraq troops, the only forces left to gviard o\.;r aerodromes wavering-&quot;5.     His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government considered my despatch and In July, 1927, came to the conclusion that they could not propose the admission of Iraq into the League in 1928, largely because this might be represented by Turkey
as a non-fulfilment of the condition on which Mosul was assigned to Iraq (i,e,/prolongation of British tutelage)t but that they would promise to propose her admission in 1932.4.     During the three months occupied by this discussion there had been a rapid deterioration in the Iraq situation^ The King and his favourites wished to &quot;pass an early Conscription Act, really so as to obtain cheaply a big army to support the monarchy, but ostensibly for the purpose of taking/1920 full responsibility for external and internal defence.     The proposal for conscription aroused intense opposition among the tribes, both Arab (especially the Shiah Arabs)and Kurdish, and tho King professed to believe that the only way in which he could get the Act passed was to create a wave of enthusiasm by securing from Ills Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government an immediate promise of release from British tutelage by admission of Iraq Into the League in 1928.      The King grew very Impatient at the delay in His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government!s pronouncement on this point and allowed his friends to begin an agitation which developed cn anti-British lines.      Relations between the Iraq Government and myself became strained and on my reports Ur* Amery expressed a desire to see me before he started on his tour.     Before I left Iraq the King said that,  if His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government would not promise to get Iraq into the League in 1928,  It would suffice for his purposes that there should be drawn up a new Treaty which, by providing for a relaxation of British tutelage and a conspicuous advance towards independence would placate the nationalist politicians. He desired to discuss such a Treaty himself In London. This was the alternative course which I urged on Mr. Amery
when I reached London in the middle of July.     Mr,Amery *0 * before his departure authorised the despatch to Iraq of a telegram stating in very guarded terms that departmental discussions on the possibility of making a treaty on the lines desired by the King wore being undertaken and that it might be convenient if the King were near at hand for the purpose of consultation.      It was on the strength of this telegram that the King visited Fur.ope and subsequently came to London.     Unfortunately he announced in Baghdad before he started that His Britannic Majesty !s Government agreed entirely with his ideas and he allowed it to be believed that he was confident of returning with a treaty which would grant to Iraq complete independence.     The Arab press re-sounded with acclamation of the Patriot King and he had a tremendous send off from Baghdad early In August, 1S27. 5. .    The promised inter-departmental dismissions in London regarding the proposed new treaty lasted until the middle of October, during which time King Feisal waited in Europe,-In the meanwhile the Acti::g High Commissioners (first I&apos;r. Bourdillon, and then Air Vice harshal Sir Edward Ellington) had sxibmitted reports very hostile to King P^isal personally, in which it was represented that it v/as only the King and a small gang of adventurers who desired a relaxation of British control and that the mass of the inhabitants feared nothing so much as such relaxation. .   The opposition to conscription and the agitation against the Iraq Government Shiahsamong the     /    was said to bo growing more intense and the fall of the Iraq Cabinet was represented as being only deferred until my return to Iraq,     These reports greatly influenced the course of the inter-departmental discussions on the proposed modifications in the treaty, and made it obvious that it would be impossible to omit from the treaty a provision that His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government should
continue to give advice to the Iraq Government.     considered, however, that the reports of the two Acting High Commissioners were couched in somewhat exaggerated terms, especially in their references to. King Feisal personally, and I recorded an opinion to this effect,     I considered especially that they underestimated the probable effect on the political classes cf a failure on the part of the Iraq Government to secure some Immediate advance towards independence, and that they underestimated also the inflxience of the political classes in the country, and I remained of the opinion set forth in paragraph 2 of this note. 6.     The formal official negotiations having lagged, owing to the incapacity and want of authority of the Iraqi Prime Minister who conducted them, they were replaced by unofficial discussions between King Feisal and myself, at the request of the former.     These Informal discussions have, now failed, after agreement had been reached on most points.     The principal and almost sole reasons for the breakdown is the refusal of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government to agree to the incorporation In the proposed Treaty with Iraq of an article similar to article I of the Treaty with the King of the Hejaz and Nejd, recognising; without qiialifications, &quot;the complete independence&quot; of Iraq,,      It was most unf ortunate that the Treat with Ibn Saud had been published a few days before the arrival of King Feisal in England, for his bitter personal enmity and rivalry with Ibn Saud mate him determined not to accept for Iraq an international status apparently less than that granted to the Hejaz and Nejd.      No amount of reasoning will move him on this point.      It is true that, even if His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government had yielded to the King&apos;s wishes in regard to the    nominal admission of &quot;ocmple^e independence&quot;, a second snag remained in the shape of our insistence on the continued right to provide advice to Iraqu But we had not como to grips on this point and there were indications that, although It was extremely distasteful   to
him, the King might eventually have accepted some ^OQformula which would have secured what we wanted.      It was on the refusal to recognise&quot;complete Independence&quot; that the King based his conclusion that he could not usefully continue the discussions,70      I have myself been throughout of the opinion that, as the Independence of Iraq would be obviously limited and conditioned in the other articles of the Treaty and in the agreements, it would have been harmless to accept the phrase which the Iraq delegation so earnestly desired. And since the termination of the informal discussions It has been suggested that we should now accept the phrase without qualification and attempt to   renew the official negotiations.     It is doubtful whether they would now succeed.     Under instr\ic Ions from His Britannic Majesty!s Government I informed King Peisal that they could not yield on &quot;this point and that any mention of &quot;complete Independence&quot; must be qualified by a reference to Great Britain!s international obligations in respect of Iraq.      If we were now to go back on this, the King might believe that we would do anything to get a new Treaty with Iraq and his attitude ywould probably be stiffened on the remaining question of advice, upon which we cannot yield. 8.     We now have to consider the position which will result.      I am sure that we shall have to face serious difficulties in Iraq, as I hove already indicated.     The Ring has warned me that there will be such difficulties and has studiously evaded my suggestion that he should co-operate with me in minimising them.     He will, I fancy, take good care that they arise.     There will probably be almost immediately a violent &quot;outburst against Great Britain in the Baghdad Press, whatever nay be the form of the announce-rnent made regarding the breakdown of the negotiations, and
and there will be nationalist demonstrations in Baghdad and JAosulo     V;e know that the Iraq Diplomatic Agent in London has already written to the Acting Prime Minister in Iraq that people in England seem to think that the King does not represent the wishes of the nation and that an agitation must be got up to prove the conti^ary.     Thin agitation cannot fail to have an effect in India, Persia and Egypt, where the Cairo Press is in close relations with the Baghdad Press; and it is quite possible that it may seriously inneril the acceptance by the Egyptian V-afd of tho proposed Anglo-Egyptian Treaty.     For the Egyptian extremists will probably declare that they cannot be less patriotic than the Iraqis. There may be some offset to tho extremistdemonstrations of Baghdad in the shape cf Sblahs rejoicing elsewhere that there is no chance of consc iption being enforced; but the last thing to be desired is that British representatives in Iraq should be flung into the arms of the unstable and retrograde Shishs and should have to rely cn them for support.      I fear that there is a distinct chance that no reputable Iraqi will find himself able to form a ministry to carry on in the conditions which will now prevail, unless he accepts an overwhelmingly Shiah ministry.     For so timid are the more moderate Iraqi politicians that they will not face the obloquy    of the extremists.     We must be prepared, therefore, to find that, on the resignation of J?.far Pasha&apos;s Cabinet, which is an inevitable consequence of the failure of the negotiations. King Feisal will be left without a ministry and will be secretly delighted at the embarrassment caused to us thereby.      If not faced with violent opposition, we shall at least, I think, be faced with a strike of politicians.     A&apos;d there may be gradual reverberation in the Provinces.     The situation will provide an obvious opportunity for Bolshevist intriguos from which Iraq has hitherto been free.
9.     The only palliative that I can see for this state of things is a show of determination and force.     7/e cannot afford to sit still and allow the Arab press to rave against us or demonstrations against us to go unpunished.     I foresee that I may have at a very early date to demand from the Iraq Government the suppression of newspapers and the trial of agitators.      It is possible that almost any Iraq Ministry that might he formed would resign rather than accede to such a request.      If this happened, I should be thrown back upon article 12 of the Military agreement which provides that the King of Iraq on the request of the Kigh Commissioner shall, if British forces undertake military operations in Iraq to suppress civil commotion, proclaim martial law and entrust Its administration to the Air Officer Commanding.     Article 120 of the Iraq Organic Law , however, makes the concurrence of the Cabinet necessary to the proclamation:natlon of martial lav; in such circumstances, and the Cabinet might refuse to concur.     We should then be forced to take the law into our own hands, claiming execution of the treaty.10.      I wish with all respect to make it clear in these circumstances that I am forced to advise that there shall be no reduction in the present British forces in Iraq for a considerable period.   &quot; It had been intended that the remaining Indian Battalion should go during the present cold weather. I could not now be responsible for the safety of British lives and Interests In Iraq, were this reduction to bo insisted on and I fear that Kis Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government will have to face the fact that military chavges in Iraq caiinot, at least during the coming year,&apos;be reduced as had been anticipated. &apos;11.     I deeply regret to have to submit to His BritannicMajesty&apos;s Government so lamentable a forecast, but I should fall in my duty were I to prophesy smooth things.(Intd.j H.D.   2o/Xl/27.-1 &apos;1.
The conversations with His Majesty King i^feisal and his Prime Minister which began in October have now been concluded.    These conversations had as their object the revise of Anglo-Iraq relations in the light of the provisions of Article III of the Anglo-Irac Treaty of January, 1926, in which His Majesty^- Government promised to take into active consideration in 1928 the question whether it was possible to recommend to the League of Nations that Iraq should next year be admitted as a member.The two Governments have also had to consider whether, having regard to the fact that Iraq was to assume in March, 1928, full responsibility for the maintenance of internal order and the defence of Ira^ from external aggression, it would be well to conclude a new Treaty which would adapt the old Treaty to the change of circumstances resulting from this transference of responsibility.After due consideration the British Government have decided that, although it is evident that the Iraq Government has made the most creditable progress in organising the administration of the country on sound lines; it is not possible at present to recommend that Irac should be admitted to the league of Nations, and thereby assume international responsibilities which might prove to be beyond its capacity to discharge.     His Majesty King Beisal has, however, obtained an assurance that if the present rate of progress is maintaineci. and all goes well in the interval, the British Government will support the candidature of Iraq for admission to the League in 1932,The question of the conclusion of a new Treaty has also been closely examined by both 3idesc    It was found that the resources of Iraq wore not at present sufficient to meet the
expenses of the upkeep of national forces adequate to assure internal order and the defence of her frontiers, and that Great Britain would, at any rate, for the time being have to provide Iraq with some measure of military assistance, it being for the British Government to decide from time to time the form and extent of assistance to be provided.These two decisions:Firstly, that Iraq is not for the present ready to enter the league, and,Secondly, that there is still a need of military help, removed the principal reasons for a readjustment of Anglo-Iraq Treaty relations.      It was accordingly agreed that the Treaties of 1922 and 1926 should remain in force. but that active discussions should be continued after the return of His Majesty Xing Feisal to Iraq for the amendment of the Military and Financial Agreements in order to bring them into accord with the existing circumstances0
