(This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.!    o m r,...--------------1Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1927.Note of an Interview which the Chairman of the Board of Customs and Excise had with I LI I. The Aga Khan on the 3?-d November, 1927.1. THE Aga Khan said that he had wide experience of racing in many parts of the world and considerable acquaintance with the operation of the Totalisator. His desire was not merely to support the Jockey Club as strongly as he could in their recommendation that legislation should be introduced authorising the setting up of Totalisators on English race courses, but, impressed as he was with the shortness of Parliamentary time and the probability that if the change were introduced in a piecemeal or half-hearted fashion Parliament could not again be induced to vary it for some time, he desired to support the proposal which had been put forward by the Racing Correspondent of the &quot; Times &quot; that the Totalisator should compulsorily be made the sole means of betting, save in respect of such bookmakers as might find it worth while to operate on the course.2. He said that bookmakers had been too long fleecing the public and making for themselves a luxurious living, cramping the odds, giving ridiculous prices and causing races to be unfairly ridden in their interests. It had frequently been remarked that the only horse worth backing in any race was the one that was really trying to win, and bookmakers were responsible for horses that did not try. The presence on racecourses of large numbers of bookmakers, with their undesirable hangers-on, made racing an unpleasant experience for the ordinary man and an impossible place for ladies, unless they were in a position to secure admission to the members&apos; enclosure. They added nothing to racing, from which they gained a handsome livelihood, but rather made things worse than they might be.3. The complaints of bookmakers that their business had been reduced 50 per cent, by the betting duty were a gross exaggeration. There might have been a falling off amounting to 10 or 15 per cent., but this was due to bad trade. He thought that bookmakers had in the main recovered their payments of tax from their customers, and had cramped the odds as well, so that they were no worse off.4. There was evasion of duty, as a betting duty was evaded more or less wherever one was in force. In France he thought that 90 per cent, of the duty was evaded. But in England the principal leakage was from the smaller credit bookmakers, who did not pay as they should.5. The racecourse executives and the sport generally were in need of increased income to enable them to carry on, to improve the amenities so as to attract race-goers, to give additional or increased prizes and to assist horse breeding. There was no reason why bookmakers should run Rolls-Royces and live expensively on money which should be devoted to other and better ends.G. He therefore favoured the Totalisatoi&quot;, which would give fair odds to the persons investing money with it, would accurately pay the proper tax on its investments, and would yield a fund for the purposes already described.7. He thought, however, that the time of Parliament would bo so fully occupied with other matters in future years that the change should be introduced properly, completely, and at once.   He suggested therefore:(a) that Totalisators be introduced on racecourses, working at whatevermight be thought a proper rate of deduotion ; and(b) that it be compulsory for all Starting Price bookmakers away from thecourse to send all their bets to the Totalisator on the course.[16836]
8. To enable office bookmakers to do this, it should be compulsory for them to cease to receive any bets 20 minutes before the advertised time of a race. This would give them ample time to send their money to the Totalisator, where their bets would be accepted against a guaranteed credit. For their services in so transmitting bets, they should receive a percentage commission from the Totalisator, and they might be required to pay an extra tax to the Government. Totalisator prices should be the only published starting prices.9. By these means, the Aga Khan suggested, the betting duty would be collected with a minimum of evasion, and the office bookmaker would be put back in his true place, viz., that of commission agent pure and simple.10. He did not propose that the bookmaker on the course should be abolished, but that he should continue to take bets on payment of the betting duty as at present, subject, however, to the payment of substantial fees to the racecourse executive for the privilege of being permitted to take bets on the coui*se. The fees so obtained would go to the same fund as the surplus of the Totalisator deduction after payment of tax.11. It was pointed out to the Aga Khan that some time might elapse before Totalisators appeared on all courses, and he agreed. This difficulty might, he suggested, be met by inserting a date in the Bill after which all bets away from the course must be transmitted to the Totalisator. If this were done, he thought that all executives would stir themselves and find machines, even if it were only such portable affairs as were now moved on lorries from course to course in France.12. The Aga Khan was informed that his scheme clearly involved far-reaching changes which affected both politics and finance. His proposals would, however, be put before the Chancellor of the Exchequer.Custom House, London, E.C. 3, November 7, 1927.
