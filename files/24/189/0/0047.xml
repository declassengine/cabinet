Memorandum by the Minister of Health.I have to ask my oolleagues for a decision on tho question of the extension of the Local Authorities (Emergency Provisions) Act, 1926, which will expire on the 1st April, 1928.     This Act provided, as did the Local Authorities (Emergency Provisions) Aot, 1924, for the extension for a period of 2 years of -1. the operation of Seotion 1 of the Local Authorities (Emergency Provisions) Aot, 1923, whereby the cost of Indoor relief in the metropolis Is charged on the Metropolitan Common Poor Fund at the rate of l/3d. per head per day, and the cost of outdoor relief Is charged on the Fund at a maximum rate of 9d. per head per day.2. The operation of Section 2 of the Emergency Provisions Act of 1923, which enables Local Authorities to borrow for the purpose of providing temporarily for their current expenses, and otherwise extends their borrowing powers during the continuance of abnormal employment. The oontlnuanoe of the provisions relating to the borrowing powers of local authorities is necessary and unoontroversial.There is no reason to criticise the arrangement for pooling expenditure on indoor relief.As regards out-door relief the arrangements have no doubt oontributed to the willingness of oertain Boards of Guardians to spend large sums under this head.-1 -THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT.C A B I N E T. nSECRET &quot; Copy No. 3&apos;Q_C&quot;.P.297 (27) -Extension of the Local Authorities(Emergency Provisions) Act, 1926.
Upon each occasion on which extending legislation has been under consideration the Boards of Guardians which receive more than they contribute to the Fund have pressed for an increase in the rate of charge in respect of out-door relief, and the Boards of Guardians which contribute more -than they receive for a reduction of that rate.     On each occasion the solution has been found In a continuation of the existing rate.This substantial subvention of the poorer Metropolitan Unions by their richer brethren without any oontrol of the expenditure to which they contribute is not so keenly resented as might have been expected, and, though they complain, the richer Unions have entirely failed to make any suggestion   to meet the admitted ill results of the pooling scheme.Under a scheme of poor law reform the Metropolitan Common Poor Fund would disappear, and the poorer Unions would, no longer be able to put Into operation a policy which differs from that adopted in the rest of London, but It Is necessary to make some arrangement to cover the period which must in any event elapse before a reformed Poor Law Authority for London is in effective being.     I am advised that the Inclusion of the Act of 1926 in the Expiring Laws (Continuance) Bill is impracticable.I propose, therefore, with the concurrence of my colleagues, to introduce a Bill in the coming Session extending the operation of the Act of 1926 for a further two years.(Intld.) N.C24th November, 1927,
