the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;3 Government, and should be eturned to the Foreign Office if not required for official use.]Circulated to the Cabinet by direction of Tne Secretaiy of State for Foreign Affairs.(This Document is the Property of His Britannic Ma3e sty * s Government).RAMLEH,      22nd October, 1927. ONFIDIrTOL^(J. 3009/8/16)&apos;.Mr. Henderson to Sir Austen Chamberlain   -(Received  Octobe-r 31st.)(Mo.619 Sir,I have the honour to address you on the assumption tliab Sarwat Pasha will arrive in London almost simultaneously with this despatch.20 Though His Majesty1 s Government may by now have decided upon the line of policy to be f ollowed in any negotiations with him, a last word from Egypt may not be entirely without reason,3. There is no stability about the present internal situation in Egypt and it is impossible to foresee the de-velopments which it may have.   If a basis for negotiations is agreed upon, it must, accordingly, be uncertain when, or whether at all, Sarwat will be able to induce his countrymen to accept it.   I think it possible that Sarwat himself, even if he achieves an acceptable basis, does not contemplate immediate negotiations.   He will request to be allowed to choose his own moment.4, At th-s bams time I have no doubt whatever not only that Sarwat himself is honestly in search of a solution and is not merely seeking advantages in order to make etfc sequin til;;capital ,,
capital thereof for some inavowable purpose, tut also that the general feeling in this country at the moment is in favour of an agreement.5. In deciding therefore how far His Majesty&apos;s Government is prepared to go in the direction of con-cessions, the two facts can he predicated;   firstly that, the situation being so unstable, there is no guarantee that Sarwat can deliver the goods; but, secondly, that there is a genuine and widespread desire to have the goods delivered,6. There can be little doubt that the wisest course for the Residency is to keep aloof, except in extreme cir-cumstances, from the future internal intrigues which are inevitable in a situation so uncertain and possibly kaleido-scopic as the present one in Egypt.7. Naturally if extremism got or was likely to get definitely the upper hand, the Residency could not sit idly doing nothing.   But I have no reason to believe that there is any real danger of this.   The Watanists will or-ganise a campaign against any compromise with England and may well rally to themselves the extremer elements of the Y/afd.   I would, however, personally scout, short of any mishandling of the situation on our part, the possibility of disorders and would regard even the contingency of a pacific extremism in Parliament as unlikely.8, There is, nevertheless, an eventuality in which, however keen our anxiety to keep out of the internal imbroglio, the relations with England will become the de-cisive factor in the struggle between the different politi-cal parties and individuals in this country.9.   Sarw&amp;t ..
9. Sarwat Pasha alleges that if he cannot secure an acceptable basis in London he will drop the question of negotiations altogether and keep the drafts exchanged to himself. But it is scarcely conceivable that it would ever be possible for him to do so.   Others, though they may be few, have already seen the drafts and their con-tents could not remain entirely hidden.10. If Sarwat Pasha1s mission to London is a failure, he will on his return here assuredly be inter-pellated in Parliament and have to Justify his actions......* &apos;Though he might not publish the actual texts exchanged, he will scarcely be able to prevent the gist of them from becoming known and in any case would certainly in self defence or as political propaganda reveal the British conditions which had appeared to him as inacceptable.11. It seems certain therefore that whether an agreement with Sarwat is reached or not, the form now adopted   for our minimum demands must become public. If they can be possibly represented as inconsistent with the independence of Egypt we shall be faced with an in-ternal crisis centred upon the relations between this-country and England.   If they are such as to appear un-generous and suspicious of Egyptian good faith, the barometer of better feeling for England which has been steadily rising since 1S25 among the politically conscious classes will drop again abruptly.12. It seems to me therefore that it would be a grave error to withhold now the things that we are pre-pared to yield, for fear lest improper use may be made   -out of them without our achieving in the end that settle-ment which those concessions were made to ensure. Itseems ..
seems to me in fact that Sarwat13 discussions in London last July have forced us into a position in which we must frankly and very precisely state what we are prepared to give way upon and what we insist must he maintained,13. Nor do I see anything hut real advantage in such an unequivocal definition. Egypt has the right to he made aware of what we regard as indispensable to the safety of our Empire,   On the other hand we shall expose ourselves to a charge of ill-faith, which it will he difficult to refute, if we use the vagueness of the clauses of the 1922 Declaration to whittle away the free grant of independent sovereignty and internal liberty which that unilateral document conceded. The political unwisdom in the long run of Buch a tendency can scarcely be doubted.14.   In my opinion we stand to lose less eventually from erring now in excess of confidence than in excess of mistrust.   In deciding therefore upon the basis for any future treaty, the most expedient and at the same time most honourable course at the moment would seem to me to go unhesitatingly and without compulsion as far as we possibly can in the direction of reconciling our written gift of Egyptian independence and sovereignty with our indisputable right to imperial self-preservation and with our obligation to ensure, without interference by Egypt, the peaceful and continuous development of the Sudan.I have, &amp;c.NEVTLE HENDERSON,Acting High Commissioner.
