^Printed for the Cabinet.  November 1927.J 3104/488/16]I CALL attention to the action of the Egyptian Minis an English Shakespearian Company.  The &quot; Near East &quot; a minister in giving a subsidy to an English Shakespearian Company. The &quot; Near East &quot; announces that there was such a rush for seats by the students that two extra performances had to be arranged.If the Foreign Office were allowed annually the cost of one regiment to be spent on cultural propaganda, it might be found in the long run to be an economy.A. C.Foreign Office, November 12, 1927.Mr. Henderson to Sir Austen Chamberlain. (Received November 7.) (No. 631.)Sir, Ramleh, October 29, 1927.I HAVE the honour to transmit herewith the translation of an announcement, published in the &quot; Moqattam,&quot; of the inauguration of free courses in Italian for Egyptian students, apparently under the auspices of the Italian Fascio in Egypt.2. As another instance of Italian cultural propaganda in this country, I would mention that the Minister of Education, in the course of conversation with a member of my staff, let drop a remark to the effect that M. Mussolini was subsidising an Italian season at the Royal Opera House this winter. The opera season is being organised by Count Visconti of Rome. Official Italian interest in Count Visconti&apos;s project of an Italian Institute of Music in Cairo is made clear in the press telegram, a copy of which is enclosed herewith.3. It is interesting, on the other hand, to note that the English company of Mr. Robert Atkins, which is to give a number of representations of Shakespeare next month at the Royal Opera House, has to rely on a financial guarantee given by the Minister of Education. We can hardly hope always for a Minister desirous of promoting English dramatic effort in Egypt. Shamsi Pasha is also anxious to introduce the better kind of English musical comedy, but his enthusiasm in these matters is likely to be influenced by the financial results of the Shakespeare season.4.   I am sending a cop3r of this despatch to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Rome.I have, &amp;c.NEVILE HENDERSON,Acting High Commissioner.Enclosure 1.Extract from the &quot;Moqattam&quot; of October 25, 1927.(Translation.) -Free Educational Service for Egyptian Students.THE Committee of the Italian Fascist party in Egypt announces that on the 25th October Dr. Luigi Rinaldi will start his free courses in Italian for Egyptian students who desire to complete their course of studies in Italian universities at the Royal Italian School in Cairo.Courses will be held on Saturdays and Tuesdays from 6 to 7 p.m.The Fascist party seizes this opportunity to inform all.students that Egyptians are accepted free of charge in Italian universities, besides being granted other facilities regarding travelling expenses, &amp;c.4198   [16824]
