Printed far the Cabinet. &apos; November 1927.SECRET. Copy No.   30CP. 298 (27).CABINET.COLONIAL MILITARY CONTRIBUTIONS COMMITTEE.REPORT.Composition of Committee and Terms of Reference.AT their Meeting on the 20th July, 1927 (Cabinet 41 (27), Conclusion 4), the Cabinet had before them a Memorandum (CP. 219 (27)) by the Secretary of State for War on the subject of Military Contributions by Colonial and other Govern-ments, and agreed that a Committee composed of The First Commissioner of Works (Chairman),The Chancellor of the Exchequer or the Financial Secretary to theTreasury, The Secretary of State for Scotland, The Acting Secretary of State for the Colonies, and The Financial Secretary of the War Office,should examine and report on the proposals of the Secretary of State for War, on the understanding that the present moment was not favourable for raising the question of a contribution from Egypt.Cabinet Decision of July 28, 1927, respecting the Committee&apos;s Terms ofReference.2. On the 28th July, 1927 (Cabinet 45 (27), Conclusion 6), the Chairman informed the Cabinet that it had become clear, in the course of the Committee &apos;s discussions, that no considerable financial relief was likely to result from the proposals in CP. 219 (27), and that the Acting Secretary of State for the Colonies had suggested that the Colonies might be willing to contribute to the cost of Imperial Defence as a whole in case where they much disliked making a contribution towards the cost of the Army. In these circumstances, the Cabinet were invited to consider whether the enquiry ought not to be conducted on much broader lines than those included in the Committee&apos;s present Terms of Reference.   The Cabinet agreed (a.) That the Committee should be asked to report on their limited Terms of Reference.(6.) That the wider question should be considered when the Committee&apos;s Report came before the Cabinet.The Committee accordingly submit the following Report.3. In addition to the Secretary of State for War&apos;s Memorandum (CP. 219 (27)), the War Office have laid before us a Historical Sketch of the general principles underlying Military Contributions, and also further memoranda regarding the proposals for revised or new contributions. We have carefully considered the representations contained in a Memorandum by the Acting Secretary of State for the Colonies, in which attention is drawn to the serious political, financial and economic difficulties, which, in the view of the Colonial Office, will[16785] b
result if the whole of the War Office suggestions are adopted. We have also conferred with a representative of the Home Office regarding the proposals concerning the Channel Islands.4. The views of the Secretary of State for Air are set out in a Memorandum CP. 223 (27) circulated to the Cabinet. In the view of the Air Ministry, the Royal Air Force must necessarily be considered first and foremost as an Imperial Service, and the tying up of its units permanently at specific points in response to local needs and under obligations to local governments should, therefore, be avoided so far as possible.The Air Ministry accordingly propose to pursue the present policy of considering ad hoc, on each occasion when an Air Force unit is to be stationed in a colony or dependency, the most favourable arrangement which can be made, from the point of view of the Home Exchequer according to the circumstances of the particular case.The Committee accept the Proposals of the War Office as a Basis forDiscussion.5. At the outset of our enquiry we came to the conclusion that the most satis-factory way of examining the question would be to accept the proposals of the War Office as a basis for discussion. The adoption of this procedure has reduced the size of the problem in two respects. In the first place, the fact that the War Office make no proposals as regards contributions from Colonies with no Imperial garrisons and make no suggestions for alteration of the present arrangements in the cases of certain other Colonies relieves us of the duty of making any recommendations as regards these Colonies, all of which are grouped together in paragraph 15 below. Ln the second place, we are relieved from the. necessity of making any recommendation on the conflicting views of the War Office and the Colonial Office as to the principles governing the question of Colonial Military contributions. The attitude of the two Departments towards this question is briefly summarised in the following paragraphs.The General Principles of Colonial Contributions.6. None of the numerous Select and other Committees which in the past have considered the question of Colonial defence contributions has laid down any clear principle for settling the incidence of the cost of oversea garrisons. Perhaps the nearest approacb,-fco the enunciation of a fixed principle was made in 1888 by Lord Haliburton&apos;s Colonial Contributions Committee in a report on the Straits Settle-ments: &quot;They hold, however, that so long as a colony makes no contribution towards the cost of its naval defence it may fairly be asked to bear the full cost of its garrison, and of maintaining its land defences, provided that charge does not absorb any undue proportion of its revenue.&quot;7. The War Office attach the greatest importance to the maintenance of the following two principles, which, in ttieir view, emerged from the discussions of the Haliburton Committee in the years 1888-97, and which they contend have governed the question since that time: (a.) Where a Colony is defended by naval as well as military forces, so long as it makes no contribution towards the. annual cost of naval defence it should pay as far as it is able the full cost of the military garrison, without regard to the question how far the garrison may be held to serve merely local purposes or the wider interests of Imperial defence.(6.) It is impracticable to divide a garrison (or its maintenance cost) into one part required for local defence and another part required for Imperial defence.8. The Colonial Office do not, however, accept these principles, and refer to the finding of the Select Committee of the House of Commons on Colonial Military Expenditure, 1861, to the effect that in the case of military garrisons and places maintained chiefly for objects of Imperial policy the responsibility and main cost of their defence properly devolves on the Imperial Government. The Colonial Office urge that it is inequitable that a Colony should be called upon to bear the cost of an Imperial garrison placed in the Colony for purely strategic reasons. The Colonial Office further point out to insist on such an arrangement in the West Indian and
West African cases would involve comparatively poor Colonies, such as Bermuda and Sierra Leone, in heavy financial obligations from which fheir more prosperous neighbours would altogether escape.The Revenue Percentage Basis of Contribution.9. In the course of our enquiry our attention has been drawn to the objections which have from time to time been raised to the present system, under which certain Colonies pay the full cost of their garrison subject to some maximum equal to a percentage of their gross revenue. This system has been in operation for many years in the case of the Eastern Colonies (Hong Kong, the Straits Settlements, Ceylon and. Mauritius), and the War Office now propose to extend it elsewhere.10. It has been suggested to us that it might be preferable if the Colonial contribution took the form of a fixed annual payment, the amount of which might be subject to review (say) every five years.  Apart from other advantages, this sugges-more favourable percentage basis of other Colonies. . The War Office, however, prefer to retain the present method of assessing the contributions (which was adopted in 1895 to meet the wishes of the Colonies), and, in any case, the alternative method suggested above could only be adopted and acted upon after an elaborate financial enquiry into the circumstances of each Colony, an enquiry which, apart from the doubtful character of its results, would have to be renewed every five years. In view of these considerations we have come to the conclusion that this suggestion could best be examined in connection with the wider enquiry referred to in (6) of paragraph 2 above, and we have accordingly proceeded on the assumption that the system of a contribution equivalent to the cost of the garrison, but subject to some maximum equal to a percentage of the gross revenue of the Colony, should for the present be adhered to.11. We have examined the proposals of the War Office with a view to ascertaining what, in our opinion, would be a fair and reasonable amount for each of the Colonies concerned to contribute towards the cost of its military defence. It by no means follows, however, that a contribution which appears fair and reasonable to us would be so regarded by the particular Colony in question.12. As will be seen below, in most of the cases where the War Office propose to obtain new contributions the Colonies have local Legislatures exercising complete financial control. In these cases no question of compulsion can arise, and any military contribution could only be obtained as a result of friendly negotiation. In the view of the Colonial Office the prospects of obtaining voluntary contributions of an appreciable amount from these Colonies are not promising. Apart from the fact that in most of the cases where hitherto no contribution has been paid, the Colonies will be definitely hostile to the idea of a military contribution; there is, of course, the question of ability to pay, on which special emphasis has been laid by the colonial13. If the Cabinet adopt our recommendations, it will fall to the Colonial Office to negotiate with those Colonies with unofficial majorities in their Legisla-tures and to give directions in other cases; we have endeavoured to have regard to these important considerations in framing our proposals, and have also taken into account the fact that in certain cases the Colonies already bear the whole or part of the cost of their local forces.14. Apart from India and the self-governing Dominions, the War Office have classified Colonial and other Governments for the purpose of the inquiry asI._Colonies with an Imperial garrison which make a contribution towardsthe cost of that garrison.II._Colonies with an Imperial garrison which make no contribution towardsthe cost of their defence. Ill-Colonies with no Imperial garrisons. IV. Other Governments.The only Colonies which at present contribute towards the cost of their Imperial garrison are the four comprised in I above, namely, Hong Kong, Mauritius, the Straits Settlements and Ceylon. In the last three completed years these four Colonies have contributed a total of  3,162,000 in aid of Army funds.tion might preventpercentage basis with theOffice.follows : [16785]b 2
Cases in which War Office make no Proposals for Change.15. The War Office make no proposals as regards Class III Colonies with no Imperial garrisons. In the cases of the following Colonies under I, II and IV above, no change in the arrangements at present in force is contemplated for the reasons indicated.I. Colonies which make a contribution. Hong Kong and Mauritius.The War Office do not suggest any alteration in the arrangement with Hong Kong, which pays up to 20 per cent, of the assessable revenue, or Mauritius, which pays 5^ per cent, of the revenue irrespective of the size of the garrison.The Governor of Hong Kong has suggested a revision of the basis of calculation with a view to &quot; eliminating the constant dilficulties and differences of opinion to which the present system is continually giving rise.&quot; This proposal is still a subject of correspondence with Hong Kong, and at present the Colonial Office, while desirous of drawing attention to the severe strain on the finances of Hong Kong entailed by existing conditions in South China, do not suggest any alteration.II. Colonies with an Imperial garrison which make no contribution towards thecost of that garrison.Gibraltar.The War Office do not consider it practicable to obtain any contribution from the revenue of Gibraltar.Cyprus.In pursuance with the conclusion reached by the Cabinet on the 20th July, 1927 (Cabinet 41 (27), Conclusion 5), respecting the arrangements for relieving Cyprus of the Tribute ( 92,800 p.a.) applied to the service of the Turkish Guaranteed Loan of 1855, the Government of Cyprus have agreed to contribute  10.000 p.a. towards the cost of Imperial Defence with effect from the 1st January, 1928.IV. Other Governments.Egypt.The Cabinet have decided that the present moment is not favourable for raising the question of a contribution from Egypt (Cabinet 41 (27), Conclusion 4).Sudan.The Cabinet have decided that the difference between the cost of maintenance in the Sudan and at home of the Military garrison (and of the air squadron) should be defrayed by a non-interest-bearing loan to the Sudan Government from the Home Government, such loan to be repaid when the Sudan Government is in a position to do so (Cabinet 40 (27), Conclusion 1 (&amp;)).North China.The War Office do not propose that any contribution should at present be claimed from Tientsin or Wei-hai-wei.Cases in which Proposals for Revised or New Contributions have been Made.16. We now proceed to consider the remaining cases in regard to all of which specific proposals have been submitted to us, viz., The Straits Settlements, Ceylon, Malta, Bermuda, Jamaica, Sierra Leone and the Channel Islands.The Straits Settlements.17. In 1867 the Straits Settlements at their request were transferred from the Indian to the Imperial Government, on condition that no new charge for their
defence should thereby be entailed to Imperial funds. In accordance with conclusions reached by the Haliburton Committee in 1895* the Straits Settlements have since that date made an annual contribution of the full cost of the garrison up to a maximum of 20 per cent, of the revenue. Until 1913-14 the cost of the garrison exceeded 20 per cent, of the revenue and the balance was met from Army funds. Since 1913-14 the cost of the garrison has fallen short of the 20 per cent. In 1925 the revenue assessable to contribution was  3,640,000, of which 20 per cent, would be  728,000; the cost of the garrison, and therefore the Colonial contribution for that year, was only  477,000, or about 13 per cent, of the revenue.18. Recently, owing to the commencement of expenditure on the new Naval Base, the ratio of the cost of the garrison tc the revenue has again begun to rise; thus the latest (1927) estimate of the military expenditure is  558,000, or about 15 per cent, of the (1925) revenue. This total includes  142,000 for capital expenditure cn land works and armaments for the defences of the new Base.19. The programme for the formation of the Base during the next few years will involve military expenditure, greatly in excess of 20 per cent, of the Colony&apos;s probable revenue, and this excess will, in any case, fall finally on Army funds. Ihe details of the proposals for the new defences and the future garrison are at present under review, and reliable figures are not, therefore, at the moment available. A conjectural forecast submitted to us contemplated that the total military expenditure in any one year might gradually rise from the  477,000 in 1925 to perhaps  1,100,000 a few years hence, thereafter falling to something over  700,000 in 1934, when the new Base may be expected to be completed; we nave, however, since been informed that the result of a review of the scheme may be to reduce the estimates for capital and maintenance expenditure in future years.20. On the part of the Colony, it has been urged, with regard to the terms on which it was transferred to the Imperial Government, that during the negotiations the War Office had stated : &apos;&apos; The amount of force to be maintained in them (the Settlements) will therefore be determined by the wants and needs of the inhabitants&quot; ; that since 1867 the strategic position has been entirely altered by the opening of the Suez Canal and the consequent development of Singapore from being a local trading centre to a strategic post on the route to China and Australia; that in 1899 Mr. Chamberlain gave an assurance which is interpreted as meaning that the Colony would not be liable to pay for additional expenditure involved by the development of Singapore as a base for imperial purposes; and that, in short, the Colony is in no way committed to paying for anything over and above the cost of local defence. The Colony has also pointed out that various items of expenditure undertaken on defence grounds, e.g., a subsidy to a Light Aeroplane Club, are not debited against the Defence contribution.21. The War Office are strongly opposed in principle to any attempt being made to divide the cost of a Colonial garrison.Thej7 see no reason why the Colony should find greater difficulty in devoting up to 20 per cent, of its revenue to Army expenditure than it did for many years prior to the war. Incidentally they suggest that in the long run the new Base should materially assist the development of the Colony&apos;s trade and prosperity.22. After . careful consideration, we think that a compromise on the following lines will provide an equitable and, we hope, permanent solution of these difficult questions : (i.) That all military expenditure (land works, armaments, &amp;c.) on the initial formation of the Singapore Base should be borne finally by Army Votes, i.e., should be excluded from the &quot; cost of the garrison &quot; for the purpose of arriving at the Colonial contribution.(ii.) That for all other military expenditure the existing arrangements should stand, i.e., the Colony should pay the full ordinary current cost of the garrison (subject always to the limit of 20 per cent, of the assessable revenue), including any military personnel added to the garrison as the new defences are gradually manned and inoluding the cost of main-tenance of the defences, old and new.* Note. The rate was originally fixed at 17^ per cent, exclusive of charges for capital expenditure on military lauds and buildings for which tho Colony wore to continue to be responsible. It was subsequently altered, with effect from 18&apos;J5 to i&apos;0 per cent, to cover all expenditure.
(iii.) That the statutory maximum percentage of its assessable revenue to be contributed by the Colony should not be reduced, but should remain at the long-established figure of 20 per cent.23. We attach (Appendix &quot;A&quot;) a conjectural forecast (prepared before the submission of the Gillman Report and therefore subject to review) showing (column 4) the amounts (about  3,219,000) which will become chargeable to Army funds under the proposal in (i) above and (column 8) the annual amounts of the Colonial contribution under (ii) above.We recommend the Cabinet (i.) To approve the proposals set out in (i), (ii) and (iii) above in final settlement of all outstanding questions respecting the amount and method of calculation of the future annual military contribution of the Straits Settlements.(ii.) To request the Secretary of State for the Colonies to communicate the proposals to the Government of the Straits Settlements after further consultation with the War Office respecting details as may be necessary.24. A further controversy has arisen over the claim of the Colony to exclude from &quot; assessable revenue&quot; the annual contribution to be made to the Opium Revenue Reserve Fund. This Fund was set up in connection with the policy of suppressing opium smoking in the British Eastern Colonies. To meet charges that Great Britain was deterred by financial considerations from taking effective steps to carry out the policy of suppression, the Government of the Straits Settlements was strongly pressed to set up this Fund, to which it is contemplated they will make annual contributions of 10 per cent, of their gross revenue, a large proportion of which is derived from the opium monopoly. Under pressure from the British Government and in the face of vigorous and increasing local opposi-tion, the Colony has been forced to increase taxation to provide this annual contribution and to save the British Government from embarrassment at Geneva. The Secretary of State for the Colonies has stated that, rather than agree to the inclusion in the &quot; assessable revenue &quot; of the Colony of the proceeds of this increased taxations-he will reconsider the question of the maintenance of the Fund, fully realising the difficulties which this may create for the British representatives at Geneva.On the other hand, the Treasury and the War Office feel that the contribution in question falls within the Colony&apos;s &quot; assessable revenue&quot; according to the accepted interpretation of that expression, and that its exclusion might constitute an embarrassing precedent.25.   On the whole, we have come to the conclusion That the annual contribution to the Opium Revenue Reserve Fund should be excluded from the revenue of the Colony assessable to military contribution, but that any sums drawn from the Fund, either in the form of interest or of capital drawings, and used as income for revenue purposes, should be included in the assessable revenue of the Colony.After careful consideration we are agreed that it would be undesirable to insist on this proposal being made a condition of the general settlement of the question of the military contribution of the Straits Settlements. The Acting Secretary of State for the Colonies has informed us that while there is a reasonable prospect of the Government of the Straits Settlements accepting the compromise embodied in paragraph 22, the whole arrangement would be imperilled by the addition to it of stipulations relating to the Opium Revenue Reserve Fund.Ceylon.26. In 1895, after prolonged and acute controversy with the Colony, the Military contribution of Ceylon was fixed by agreement at 9^ per cent, of its revenue, or three-quarters of the cost of the garrison, whichever is less, together with the cost of any capital expenditure required for military lands and buildings outside Trincomalee. Since 1905 the contribution has always been three-quarters of the cost of the garrison. The revenue of the Colony has increased from  2,293,000 in 1905 to  8,916,000 in 1925/26, while the contribution has fallen from  145,000 in 1905 to  75,000 (1927 estimate). Ceylon has its own local defence force upon which it spends almost as much as the amount of its military contribution.
27. There is a large unofficial majority in the Legislative Council, and this element exercises almost complete financial control and would be strongly opposed to any proposal to increase the military contribution. In 1925 a tentative proposal to station a British Infantry battalion in the Island met with a hostile reception. We are informed that the War Office have no present intention of sending a battalion to Ceylon, nor is it probable that one will be so sent in the future.28. We think that, having regard to the lapse of time since the present arrangement was made, and the increased prosperity of Ceylon, it would be reasonable that the Colony should now be invited to pay the full cost of the garrison. On the present size of the garrison this would mean a contribution of  100,000 per annum, equivalent to 1-1 per cent, of the revenue. When this proposal is communicated to the Ceylon Government it should be accompanied by a statement of the present intentions of the War Office respecting the future size of the garrison.29.   We accordingly recommend : (1.) That the Secretary of State for the Colonies should be authorised to invite the Government of Ceylon to contribute in future the whole of the cost of the garrison, and not three-quarters of the cost as heretofore, subject to a maximum of 9  per cent, of assessable revenue.(2.) That this invitation should be accompanied by a statement of the intentions of the War Office respecting the future size of the garrison.Malta.30. From 1875 to 1912 Malta paid a fixed contribution of  5,000 a year towards the non-effective cost of the Royal Malta Artillery; the contribution was suspended in 1912 owing to the impoverished state of the revenues. Under the Maltese Constitution all defence matters are reserved to the Imperial Government. Any contribution from Malta would have to take the form of a free-will offering voted by the local Legislature. The Colwyn Committee of 1925 recommended that the local troops in Malta should be paid for by Malta or disbanded. The cost of these local units the Royal Malta Artillery, the Malta Militia, Royal Engineers and the King&apos;s Own Malta Regiment amounts approximately to  75,000 a year, equal to about 8-7 per cent, of the revenue. A proposal to this effect was recently made to the Government of Malta, which considered that (in view of the situation arising out of the Military Training Ordinance) the moment was inopportune for submitting the matter to the Legislature.31.   We agree with the War Office in thinking that it would be reasonable to . invite the Maltese Government to contribute towards the cost of the local units, but we have been warned that Sir Gerald Strickland, the Prime Minister of Malta, is of opinion that there is no prospect whatever of Malta agreeing to make any contribu-tion at present.We recommend That the Secretary of State for the Colonies should be authorised to invite the Government of Malta to accept as a charge on local funds 50 per cent, of the full cost, equal to  37,500 per annum, of the local units, as a contribu-tion towards the defence of Malta.Bermuda.32. The garrison of Bermuda consists of half a battalion of infantry and about 100 Artillery and Engineers. At their meeting on the 1st November, 1927 (C.I.D. Minutes of the 230th Meeting, Minute 2), the Committee of Imperial Defence reached the following conclusions respecting the garrison (a.) To approve the recommendation of the Army Council that the coast defence troops* at Bermuda should be withdrawn at an early date, and that the armament and defence lights should be handed over to local forces with a staff of regular Instructors sufficient to ensure that the existing materiel will be maintained in efficient condition. (b.) That this conclusion should be subject to annual review.The estimated cost to Army funds of the garrison of Bermuda (including  5,000 per annum in respect of local units) is about  170,000 a year, while the* Note. This refers only to the Artillery aud Engineers j there is no proposal to remove the half battalion of infantry.
revenue of the Colony is about  250,000 a year. At present Bermuda is making a war contribution of fifteen annual payments of  3,450, and we are informed that the local Legislature have recently offered to make a small military contribution of about  2,500 per annum to take effect on the cessation after 1929 of the war contribution. In the event of a contemplated reduction of the size of the garrison being effected, even this meagre contribution may be reduced. The War Office consider that it would be reasonable to ask the Colony to contribute up to 20 per cent, of its revenue, i.e.,  50,000 per annum, to.be reached by yearly stages of 5 per cent.33. In Bermuda complete financial control is exercised by the local Legislature. While, in the view of the Colonial Office, no useful purpose would be served by making a fresh application, that Department consider that a maximum contribution which Bermuda could make without grave detriment to the Colony would be about  12,500 per annum.We recommend That the Secretary of State for the Colonies should be authorised to invite the Government of Bermuda to make a military contribution of  12,500 per annum towards the cost of its garrison, this amount being additional to the Colony&apos;s war contribution of  3,450 per annum.Jamaica.34. Jamaica contributed towards the cost of its garrison for about a century prior to 1845, when the contribution ceased owing to the depressed financial condition of the Colony. The estimated cost of the garrison for 1927 is  247,000, all borne by Army funds. Jamaica pays the cost (about  14,000 per annum) of her local units; this is equivalent to about 1 per cent, of her revenue of  2,000.000 per annum.35. The War Office have proposed to us that Jamaica should accept responsibility for the full cost of the garrison, subject to a maximum of 20 per cent, of her gross revenue. On the present strength of the garrison, the suggested contribution would be equivalent to about 12^ per cent, of the Colony&apos;s assessable revenue. y*36. Jamaica makes a voluntary contribution of forty annual payments of  60,000 to the Home Government towards the cost of the war; this, added to expenditure on local forces, makes a total of  80,000 per annum, or 4 per cent, of the local revenue. In the view of the Colonial Office, any attempt to enforce a contribution of the amount contemplated by the War Office would meet with such a degree of local opposition as would render its realisation wholly impracticable. The maximum additional amount, which in the opinion of the Colonial Office the Colony might be able to pay without serious risk of crippling its finances, would be about  20,000 a year; but this would only be obtained with very great difficulty and would involve additional taxation.37. We appreciate the force of these considerations, but think that Jamaica might reasonably be asked to contribute  25,000 per annum.We accordingly recommend : That the Secretary of State for the Colonies should be authorised to invite the Government of Jamaica to make a contribution towards the cost of the garrison of  25,000 per annum, this contribution being additional to the annual amounts of  60,000 (war contribution), and  20,000 (cost of local forces) at present paid by the Colony.Sierra Leone.38. The estimated cost of the Imperial garrison of Sierra Leone is  150,000 for 1927, all of which is met by Army funds. Sierra Leone contributes rather less than  40,000 per annum to the cost of the West African Frontier Force. As the revenue of the Colony is about  945,000 per annum, this contribution is equivalent to under 4 per cent, of the revenue.39. The War Office propose that Sierra Leone should bear the full cost of its garrison within a maximum of 20 per cent, of its revenue to be reached in yearly stages of 5 per cent.i
40. In opposition to this suggestion the Colonial Office have represented to us (a) that the Imperial garrison is situated in Sierra Leone merely because Freetown happens to be the best natural harbour on the West coast of Africa and is a defended port, the headquarters of the African station of the Navy; and (b) that Sierra Leone is a small, poor and very backward Colony, and that any Attempt to force upon the unofficial members of the Legislature expenditure of such a character as a Military contribution in present circumstances, at any rate, would cause the greatest embarrassment to the Government.41. At their Meeting on the 1st November, 1927, the Committee of Imperial Defence reached the following conclusions respecting the garrison of Sierra Leone: (a.) That the Regular Royal Artillery and Royal Engineers at Freetown, Sierra Leone, should be withdrawn at an early date, the armament and defence lights being placed on a care and maintenance basis under a small supervisory staff.(6.) That the above conclusion should be subject to annual review.(c.) That the West African Regiment at Sierra Leone should cease to be a charge on War Office estimates, and that the Secretary of State for War should discuss with the Secretary of State for the Colonies (in consultation, if desired, with the Cabinet Committee on Military Contributions by the Colonies), the future dispositions to be made as the result of this conclusion; and that, unless they are able to arrive at some arrangement for its maintenance on Colonial Votes, the West African Regiment should be disbanded.42. If the West African Regiment is disbanded, the only troops left in Sierra Leone will be the care and maintenance units mentioned above; the Acting Secretary of State for the Colonies has suggested to us that the cost of these units might be borne collectively by the West African Colonies in such proportions as may be determined by the Colonial Office.We concur in this suggestion, and recommend That when a final decision has been reached as to the garrison to be main-tained in Sierra Leone for Imperial defence purposes, the cost of the care and maintenance units at Freetown should be borne collectively by the West African Colonies in such proportions as may be determined by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.The Channel Islands.43. The estimated cost to Army funds of the garrison of the Channel Islands in 1927-28 is  300,000. This includes the cost of the regular troops and certain charges amounting to  23,000 p.a. in respect of the Channel Islands Militia, the remaining cost of which (about  12,000 p.a. at present) falls upon local funds. Exclusive of such items as local rates, which must be disregarded, the revenue of Jersey and Guernsey was in 1924  271,000 p.a., and might now be rather higher.44. The War Office propose that Jersey and Guernsey should reimburse to Army funds the charges falling on those funds for their Militia, and should in addition make some contribution to the cost of the regular troops, subject to a maximum of 20 per cent..of the revenue.45.   The Home Office have represented to us that the position of the Channel Islands is exceptional in the following respects : (1.) The whole question of the defence of the Islands is at present under the consideration of the Committee of Imperial Defence, and the result of the enquiry may be a decision to the effect that their defence in war time is impracticable. If the Islands are not to be defended, it would, in the view of the Home Office, be difficult to ask for any contribution towards the cost of regular troops stationed there in peace time.(2.) The arrangement under which the cost of the Local Militia is shared between Army and local funds is one of long standing, and in effect represents the mediaeval system under which the Islands provided the personnel and the Lord the equipment. The Islands would probably ask for the disband-ment of the Militia if the British Government decided to stop the present contribution from Army funds.   The question should first be considered[1G785] 9
whether the retention of the Militia is desired in the interest of Imperial defence. During the Great War the Militia was suspended and compulsory general service accepted, the men trained in the Militia being drafted into British units. (3.) A final settlement of the War Contribution has been reached with the Island authorities. A preliminary agreement has been reached with regard to the measures to be taken for the prevention of the use of the Islands for the avoidance of British taxation, and some time will elapse before the necessary legislation can pass the local Legislatures. In the view of the Home Office it would be wise to allow a further interval of at least six months after the passage of the legislation in question before raising&quot; with the Islands any question of an extension of their liabilities.46. Having regard to these considerations, and in view of the historical position, we think that it might be difficult to apply the usual principle and to insist on the Islands paying the full cost of their Militia or to obtain from them a military contribution of an equivalent amount.We recommend however That the present arrangements regarding the Militia should be examined with a view to seeing whether such alteration can be made as would permit of the application to Jersey and Guernsey of the usual principle that local funds should bear the full cost of local units.47. A table giving relevant particulars of the. cases under consideration is attached (see Appendix B).We recommend the Cabinet  (1.) To take note (a.) That no proposals have been made for military contributions in the case of Colonies&quot;with no Imperial Garrisons.(6.) That for the reasons set out in paragraph 15 above, no altera-tion of the arrangements at present in force is contemplated in the cases of Hong J ong, Mauritius, Gibraltar, Cyprus, Egypt, Sudan and North China.(2.) To approve our recommendations as follows:  (1.) The Straits Settlements.(a.) That the following proposals should be adopted in final settle-ment of all outstanding questions respecting the. amount and method of calculation of the future annual military contributions of the Straits Settlements: (i.) That all military expenditure (land works, armaments, &amp;c.) on the initial formation of the Singapore Base should be borne finally by Army Votes, i.e., should be excluded from the &quot; cost of the garrison &quot;for the purpose of arriving at the Colonial contribution.(ii.) That for all other military expenditure the existing arrangements should stand, i.e., the Colony should pay the full ordinary current cost of the garrison (subject always to the limit of 20 per cent, of the assessable revenue), including any military pei^sonnel added to the garrison as the new defences are gradually manned, and including the cost of maintenance of the defences, old and new.(iii.) That the statutory maximum percentage of its revenue to be contributed by the Colony should not be reduced, but should remain at the long-established figure of 20 per cent, of the assessable revenue.(&amp;.) That the Secretary of State for the Colonies should be invited to communicate the proposals to the Government of the Straits Settle-ments after further consultation with the War Office respecting details as may be necessary.(c.) That the annual contribution of the Opium Revenue Fund should be excluded from the revenue of. the Colony assessable to military contribution, but that any sums drawn from the Fund, either in the form of interest or of capital drawings, and used as income for revenue purposes, should be included in the assessable revenue of the Colony.
(2.) Ceylon.That the Government of Ceylon should be invited to contribute in future the whole of the cost of the garrison (and not three-quarters of the cost as heretofore), subject to a maximum of 9  per cent, of assessable revenue, and that this invitation should be accompanied by a statement of the intentions of the War Office respecting the future size of the garrison.(3.) Malta.That the Government of Malta should be invited to accept as a charge on local funds 50 per cent, of the full cost, equal to  37,500 of the local units, as a contribution towards the defence of Malta.(4.) Bermuda.That the Government of Bermuda should be invited to make a military contribution of  12,500 per annum towards the cost of its garrison, this contribution being additional to the  3,450 per annum now paid by the Colony as a war contribution.(5.) Jamaica.That the Government of Jamaica should be invited to make a contribution towards the cost of the garrison of  25,000 per annum, this contribution being additional to the annual amounts of  60,000 (war contribution), and about  14,000 (cost of local forces) at present paid by the Colony.(6.) Sierra Leone.That when a final decision has been reached as to the garrison to be maintained in Sierra Leone for Imperial defence purposes, the cost of the care and maintenance units at Freetown should be borne collectively by the West African Colonies in such proportions as may be determined by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.(7.) The Channel Islands.That the present arrangements regarding the Militia should be examined, with a view to seeing whether such alteration can be made as would permit of the application to Jersey and Guernsey of the usual principle that local funds should bear the full cost of local units.Signed on behalf of the Committee,PEEL, Chairman.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1, November 30, 1927.[16785]

Actually, owing to delay in completing the purchase of the land, the expenditure in 1927 will be considerably less than  142,000, while, partly in consequence of that delay, the capital expenditure in 1928 may exceed the  318,000 shown. From 1928 onwards the figures are based on the programme of works indicated in C.I.D. Paper No. 281-C, with some redistribution of figures now necessary between years. The  386,000 at the foot of column 4 (reproduced from 281-C), for special issues from stock, which cannot yet be spread over years, will in due course be distributed over the annual totals in column 6.War Office, November, 1927.
