Lie mo ran 5 confidential by tbe lord Chancellor,,In November, 1924,  I circulf-ted to the Cabinet xJjpy a memorandum (CP ,.489 (24)   proposing that an Addressitachsd,should be moved in both Houses under the Judicature Act,1910, for the appointment of two additional Judges in theEing&apos;s Bench Division, accompanied by a memorandum to thesame effect which had been prepared by my predecessor, lordHaldane, during the term of office of the labour Government,,foinet The Cabinet son roved the proposal^   the resolutions were3(24),inclusion   passed, the Address was presented on the 11th December, 1924s and lire Justice Eraser and Mr. Justice Einlay were appointed accordingly.By the operation of the Administration of Justice Act, 1925, the resolution thus passed had effect for twelve months, and, therefore, when Mr0 Justice lush resigned his office in May 1925 it was not necessary to have recoxirse again to Parliament, and Mr. Justice &quot;/right was appointed in his place,   Now, however, by the death of Mr.  Justice Eraser in July and the removal of Mr. Justice Greer to the Court of Appeal in October, the number of puisne Judges of the Eing1s Bench Division has again fallen to 15 and a, resolution for an Address is necessary to authorise the appointment of t/:o Judges so as to restore the number to 17.S nOCW^I!

There has been no such change cf circumstances as between November 1924 and the present time as would justify an endeavour to carry on the work of the  ingis Bench Division without the full number of Judges.    It is true that there is a slight reduction in the total number of causes set down for trial in the Division as against the autumn of 1924 - the total number having fallen from 1191 at the beginning of Michaelmas Term 1924 to 039 at the beginning of Michaelmas Term 1927.     But this reduction is more apparent -than real.   Non-jury cases and cases set down for speedy trial under Order XIV show a substantial reduction, but cases set down to be tried by a Judge and jury have fallen only from 465 to 442, and it is cases tried with a jury which make the largest demand upon the time of the Judges.   Both in 1924 and in 1925 legislation was before Parliament designed to restore to the civil litigant the almost unrestricted right to a jury which he possessed before the War, but to restore it only subject to certain limitations and modifications.      The matter was on both occasions very fully debated, and it was pointed out to Parliament that if the right was restored without these limitations, the effect must be greatly to increase the time occupied in the trial of actions.   Parliament with the full knowledge of this consequence deliberately refused to restrict the right in any way except so far as it wso restricted before the War.    The result is that, whereas even in the period when the general number of actions
in the Court was increasing beyond any precedent, namely in 1920, 1921, and 1922, the number of trials by Judge and jury bore a very small pro-portion to the total number tried - being as few at the beginning of Michaelmas 1921 as 63 to 1274 tried without a jury, -   in this Michaelmas Term (for the first time for many years) the number set down to be tried with a jury exceeds the number set down to be tried without a jury.    I am satisfied that a staff of 1 lord Chief Justice and 15 puisnes is unable to cope with the situation so produced.It is not only for the purpose of keeping down work generally, but also in order to keep a sufficient number of Judges in London to deal with the London work steadily and continuously, that it is now necessary to restore the number to 17.      Even with 17 Judges the number able to\ remain in London during winter and during June and July, when the calls of Circuit aro heaviest, has, in the last- two years frequently sunk to 5 or 5. end.3.
on occasions to 2 or 3 - the other Judges being occupied either on Circuit or at the Old Bailey or at the Railway and Csnal Corn-mission.     It Is obvious that with only 15 Judges the number -night on occasion be reduced to none.As during practically the whole year it is necessary that not less than 3 Judges should be available on every :;onda-&apos; to. constitute the Court of Criminal Appeal,  and as it is necessary from time to time and sometimes for a lon^ period to constitute Divisonal Courts of either 2 or 3 Judges according to the nature of the business to bs discharged, it is obvious that even with 17 paisne judges there is but a scanty,  if any, margin to discharge the current business of the Courts,At a moment when the need for economy presses with especial force, it is necessary to justify by strong argument the appointment of two additional Judces at a salary of  5C00 each.      It Is sometimes sought so to do by the argument that each Jnige earns in Court fees enough to cover his salary.      I am not prepared to adopt this argument which is inconsistent with the facts as reported to me.      On the other hand, I must print out that, if the &apos;?;ork of the Courts f.?lls seriously into arrear the
immediate result will be that parties will go to private arbitration and there will be a substantial falling off in revenue.     The operations of ths Supreme Court of Judicature and its offices as a whole show a surplus of revenue over expenditure, even including the salaries of the Judges.     I do not think that it could be contended that this surplus, which is produced entirely from the fees paid by litigants and from the operations of the Probate Division,  can permanently be applied for the purpose of general taxation.      Its first destination should be to afford to litigants as prompt justice as can reasonably be attained.I propose, therefore, that at the earliest date at which Parliamentary arrangements permit resolutions should be moved In both Houses for the Address praying for the appointment of the tv:o additional Judges allowed under the Act of 1910 (now section 11 of the Supreme Court of Judicature (Consolidation) Act,  1925).(Intld.)       C.House of Lords.14th November,  1927.
