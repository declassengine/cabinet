Road Conveyance of Passengers and Goods &quot;by RailwayIn accordance with Cabinet Conclusions 4?/27 of 2oth July, my Department has studied the safeguards which could &quot;bo suggested for incorporation in any legislation which parliament may see fit to approve for giving the Railway Companies powers to run services by road.     I also received on the 19th October a copy of the Bill which the Railway Companies propose to introduce next Session and of which they must in that event give notice by the 19th of November.     The Bill as drafted gives each Company power to &quot;own, work and use in any district to which their J system affords access road vehicles&quot;&apos;1 for the conveyance of passengers and goods.    It enables each Company to enter into agreements with &quot;any company body or person owning or running road vehicles for hire or as public service vehicles1&apos; for the working user management and maintenance of road vehicles and property provided in connexion with any road transport eor-zioes which the   Company is empowered to provide, for the supply of vehicles and labour, and for the interchange, ao3ommoelation, conveyance, transmission and dolivery of traffic conveyed or to be conveyed by means of or in connexion with any such road trans-port service and for an apportionment of roceipts.     2&apos;or the purpose of such an agreement a Company may provide any funds necessary, hold stcok, shares or securities and guarantee interest or dividends.   The clauses are thus drafted in the widest terms.   The Bill provides for an appeal to the Railway Rates Tribunal against tuore as enable rates and oharges (but not
51fares).   Th&amp; principle that the Trihunal can refuse to allow a loss on an ancillarjr business to he made good at the erpenee of the railway user is applied to road servioes operated by tho Company itself but not to servioeaoperated or controlled through agreement.   No other restrictions on the Company&apos;s power a are inserted.   In my Memorandum CJ? .200/27 circulated to the Cabinet on the 16th bi July last, to which I would beg reference, I have already dealt with the main questions of principle which arise, but it may be useful to develop some of the considerations there mentioned at greater length and to illustrate the general position of the Railway Companies by reference to a few figures.2. Accordingly, I annes in appendix I some notes setting out the present financial position of the Railway Companies, the Orend of their traffic and the reasons why their traffic is so vulnerable to road competition, and some further notes indicating directions in which the Railway Companies, if so empowered, could afford improved services in facilities to the public, a*ad, nn the other hand, the position which would arise if there were any avoidable transfer of traffic from their railways to their road services,3. It was upon this latter possibility that much of thedisoussion before the Select Committee oentred in 1922,     It was then proposed by the Ministry of IDransport that an over-riding check upon any tendency to transfer traffio from rail-way to road might perhaps be found by requiring that an equal oharge should be made for an equivalent facility i.e. that the Railway Company should aharge the same sum for transferring goods from Point     to Point 3 whether they perform the service by road or by rail or by a combination of railway service with
***the existing scheme of collection and delivery.   The Railway Companies oontend that any such restriction of their powers of oharge would make it impossible for them to oompeto with ether oarriers by road, and in the alterod circumstances I do rut think that it can, *:r should, bo imposed.     In view, howevor, of the unrestricted powers which the Railway Companies seek, it will be for them to satisfy the Seloct Committeo that thoy Bee their way to conduct their road services, which must of necessity be potentially competitivo with their railwas^s, as a business oomplomentary to their railways rather than as an alternative means of transport and to avoid an unoccnomic transfer cf traffic from rail to road.4* Apart from tho general considerations to which attention was   drawn in ray previous Memorandum, I have little information, as to the amount of opposition which the proposals of tho Railway Companies are likely to arouse,    That will bo more oasily Judged if a Bill is deposited and when petitions are lodged,    ny statement made on behalf of the Government on Second Reading would have to deal with the attitude of opponents.   Personally, I think that general opinion would regard some extension of the Railway Companies&apos; powors in this matter as fair to them and likely to be advantageous to the public   The President of the Commercial Motor Usors&apos; -association has, however, already launohed an attack against the proposals on the grounds indicated in my previous Memorandum that they must result in overloading the roads with unnecessary vehiole3, in underloading the vehicles on the road
by creating a multiplication of facilities in excess of the traffic and, lastly, in crushing the &quot;small man&quot; out of business with the result that the traders will be forced back upon alleged unsatisfactory servioos by monopolistic Railway Companies.    Beforo these objections are examined, there are one or two more general considerations with which it may be necessary to deal.5. It may be urged in the first plaoe that the properbusiness of the Railway Companies is to devote themselves to securing the highest possible degree of efficiency in the conduct of their railways as such, that they ought not to be relievod of any part of the stimulus to efficiency which i3 provided for them by road competition, and that they ought to meet such competition not by going on the roads themselves but by affording better service and facilities on their railways. It may be stated in reply that the efficiency of a Railway Company as a transport agency will be increased if it is placed in a position to coordinate and combine servioes by rail and by road, and formally it may further be retorted that the Railway Rates Tribunal is required to satisfy itself when fixing railway charges that the railways are being economically and efficiently operated and managed.6. L more serious preliminary objection may take theform of a suggestion that no further powers ought to te- granted until an Inquiry such as that suggested by Mr. William Graham has been held into the whole question whether some scheme of coordination and complementary effort between the two forms of transport cannot be secured.   This issue is bound to be raised in the course of debate on the Second Reading of any Railway Bills.   The fundamental problem is what traffic road ^nd rail are best able to handle under eoonoraioally determined conditions and the question by whose agency a road service/should
should be conducted is subordinate, though of oourBe important, 3ut the present proposals would not necessarily prejudice the course of a wider Inquiry or the adoption of a more general scheme of control or co-ordination if one were found to be practicable. Indeed, the Railway Companies hold that theywould be in a muoh better position to negotiate some scheme of co-ordination of traffic if they were armed with the power to go upon the roads themselves and to interest themselves financially in road undertakings. In meeting the objectionwhen raised, it may be pointed out that the Select Committee of 1922 declared themselves as in favour of giving powers to run road services to Railway Companies.7.        Specific opposition to the Railway Companies&apos; proposals may be offered from three principal interests:-(i)        The Local Authorities may argue that, if thepowers desired are conceded, the Railway Companies will place a large number of additional vehicles upon the roads with a resultant increase in wear and tear and in congestion, and that in turn this must lead to a higher expenditure upon the maintenance and construction of roads. It seemssufficient answer to point out that there is no justification for denying a Railway Company the use of the roads on the ground that their competition would be wasteful when no control is exerted over existing carriers of freight by road who may compete waetefully with one another or with the railways.(ii)        Traders may object to the proposals on the groundthat the burden of railway charges may be enhanced, but it ma.y reasonably be assumed that the Railways will bo run their business as to produce the best net result, and safeguards can be suggested to minimise the risk of inequities arising out of the operation of the Railways Act.The Traders may also share the fear voiced by the Commercial Motor Users&apos; Association that the railways will direct their enormous resources to a policy of crushing out the small road haulier in the hope of forcing traffic back upon the railways.        It is, however, submitted that &quot;the natural safeguards&quot; are sufficient to prevent th* establishment of effective monopoly by the Railway Companies.        The amount of capital required for the establishment of a road service is comparatively small and within the means of any substantial trade^.
t55(iii)     The commercial users of the roads will doubtless urge all the foregoing objections both general and specific in support of their existing interests.8. I turn now to safeguards which the Railway Companiesmight be asked to accept.      In general I regard it as desirablethat all road hauliers should be under substantially uniformstatutory conditions as regards the traffic they carry.     I hopethat at a very early date Parliament will be asked to pass theRoad Traffic Bill which win establish a scheme of regulation andcontrol over passenger road vehicles and services.     If the RailwayCompanies secure the extensive powers they now seek, there will beall the more reason for enforcing such regulation and control inthe interests of the travelling public and of highway authoritiesand local ratepayers. Before long it will probably also benecessary at any rate to institute some inquiry into the controland co-ordination of freight services.     In several countries where the position of the railways is being adversely affectedby road competition and where the level of highway expenditure is causing alarm, tentative efforts appear to bo made to establish a control over all regular road services.     The difficulties of moving on these lines in Great Britain are, however, very great,and an important factor to be borne in mind is that about  0;Sof the total commercial goods vehicles are stated to be in thehands of individual firms and traders and not in those oftransport contractors.9. Assuming then that no scheme of licensing roadgoods services generally is in present circumstances practicable,the &quot;sEfeguards&quot; may be considered under the following heads:-Approval of routes; Charges; Facilities; Undue Preference; Accounts and Returns ; General.
&apos; -7- 5810. I have dealt with these in detail in Appendix II and here summarise my conclusions and recommendations which are as follows:-(i)   a substantial and immediate extension of the existing powers of railway companies to run road services is fair to them ana likely to be advantageous to the public(ii)   There is no reason to await the results of any further inquiry before this step is taken.(iii)   The geographical area over which each company seeks power to run services by road is wide and somewnat indefinite, but it is difficult to suggest closer definition.   There would seem to be no reason for controlling a railway company in respect of the routes which it may use while other carriers by road are unfettered, but f  in order that the extent to which any powers granted are being used may be known, all regular services established and the areas in which other services are maintained should be reported to the Minister.The power to enter into agreements is also extremely wide and the wording of the clause requires further consideration.   The Gompanies have been asked to look into this .vith a view to seeing whether some limitation can be proposed.(iv)    No overriding safeguard can be proposed which will prevent all risk of wasteful competition between one railway company and another or entirely obviate the risk of a transfer of traffic from theii&apos; railways by the institution of potentially competitive road services but the cumulative effect of the partial safeguards which are practicable should be considerable.    It must be left to the Companies to satisfy Parliament if the point is raised that they see their way to operate their road services without these undesirable consequences.(v)   The appeal to the Railway Rates Tribunal as to the reasonableness of rates and charges may be accepted but provision should be made for publication of rates.(vi)    Sufficiently stringent provisions should be inserted to enable the Tribunal to abate the amount to be   raised by railway
charges if the road services of the Railway Companies or their investments in, or their guarantees and agreements in connexion with road services do not yield a fair return,(vii) The Companies should furnish suitable accounts, returns and statistics, and show the extent of their investments and guarantees in their published acounts.     They should also show the results of their road services for particular areas and not merely for the whole group.(viii) The Railway Companies should not be put in the position of being required to provide facilities, but the Conveyance of Mails Act should be made applicable to their road services if the postmaster General so desires.(ix) publication of agreements should not be insisted upon but copies of all agreements under the Act should be lodged with the Minister who should have liberty to transmit them to the Rates Tribunal if he thinks them relevant to the Tribunal&apos;s proceedings.(x) There should be a suitable extension of the foregoing obligations to cover the caSc of traffic carried not by Railway Companies themselves but under close working agreements with Railway Companies, but the manner in which this is to be effected requires further consideration,(xi) Discussion with the Railway Companies on points of detail has, of course, been without prejudice to the main question whether the Government can lend any support to the Bills.     I suggest that I should be authorised to inform the Companies that if they proceed with their Bills the Government will generally be prepared to state on Second Reading that they are satisfied that the time has come when an extension of the Railway Companies1 powers may properly be granted, that the Select Committee will have to consider what safeguards should be introduced into the Bill, that the Government has oome to the conclusion that certain safeguards of which the general nature is summarised above are prima facie desirable and will indicate them to the Select
5SCommittee under the usual procedure, together v;ith any further minor and drafting points that may arise and any further points that may arise on the filled Bill, and tnat tne Companies will-have to satisfy Parliament as to the points raised in (iii) and (iv) if necessary.f!now 1927
APPENDIX I.Note on the effect of the competition of road Stfrvliioa upon railway traffic.Financial position of Railway Companies.If the estimates accepted by the Railway rates tribunal are found to correspond with the facts, none of theamalgamated companies will be able to earn its standardrevenue in the near future.     The accompanying table A shows :-(al the amount of standard net revenue for each company;(b) the net revenue which will be realised in a year In the near future on the Companies&apos; estimates;(a)   the deficiency.(2)   Stagnation of Railway Traffics.It is, of course, impossible to estimate precisely the extent to which the Railways have lost traffic in consequence of the growth in transport by road.     As regards their passenger traffic, the electrification of the tramway system at the end of last oentury reduced the annual rate of increase in the number of passengers carried by rail and a similar piooess is now being witnessed as a result of the great growth of the number of privately owned motor cars and motor hackney vehicles.     The following table illustrates the growth in these vehicles :-Approximate number of licences current at 31st August.Year,	Cars taxed on Horse-Power.	Motor Hackneys (including Omnibuses)*1922 1923 1924 1925 1926 1927	314,769 383,525 473s528 579,901 676,207 778,056	77,614 85,965 94,153 98,833 99,077 95,676The increase in the carrying oapaolty of motor hackneys is considerably greater than is indicated by the increase in numbers alone.

The table reveals also that journeys by season tioket holders are now shewing the same tendency as ordinary bookings, e.g, the number of jcmrneys whioh it is estimated will be taken by season tioket hold ore in 1927 la about 14 per oent less than in 1922, and It is evident that unless the general falling off is arrestedThe effect of the new competition is the more serious as it draws away a more valuable traffic than the short distance urban traffic which was diverted to the trams.During the past two years the number of journeys taken by passengers travelling by railway (excluding the London Tubes and Metropolitan &quot;District Railway) has fallen considerably, and the figures for the first eight months of 1927 were 86,000,000, or nearly 9 per cent less than in the corresponding period of 1925.     It must not be overlooked that 1925 was one of the years of the tfembley Exhibition, but, It is estimated that the total number of journeys for the year 1927 will be approximately 1,340,000,000, as oompared with 1,332,440,000 in 1913.The following analysis of the passenger journeys taken upon the railways of Great Britain (excluding London Tubes, Metropolitan District, Metropolitan and Metropolitan Distriot and Whiteohapel and Bow Railways) is of considerable interest
the annual number of passenger journeys taken by rail will soon be less than in 1913.The decrease in passenger journeys is occurring notwithstanding that the railway companies have greatly increased the facilities offered to the public by means of cheap fares and Increased train mileage.     this is indicated by the following table :-Passenger Journeys.Ho.increase (+J crDecrease (-) compared with 1922.Ho.T(Per oent of(Ordinary ticketsIssued at fiess than full faze.OoacMag Train Mies.Ho.Increase (+J or decrease (-) comoared withismHo.1,453,583,391 1,454,663,8521,340,000,0001,280,46110.03-113,383,391-7.8d43 5766224,8(jof000 245,800,000249,100,000*21,000,000*24,300,000* 9.34+10.81Thus the number of journeys taken is less than in 1913, a greater proportion of them is taken at reduoed fares and a greater mileage is run.As regards goods traffic, the tonnage of general merchandise originating on the railways is substantially less than in 1913, as will be seen from the annexed Table ,ibn  where a series of figures with an index standardised on the year 1881 are shown.     The number of mechanically-propelled commercial goods vehicles has risen from 131,866 in February, 1921, to 274,651 in August, 1927.These figures will at once illustrate the unprogreseive character of the railway business in present oiroumstanoes and the rapid growth in transport by road.f3)   Reason for vulnerability of railway traffios.It is not possible to say how muoh of the traffic which is carried by road could bo rrcro economically carried
by rail or how muob of it has been brought into existence by the new road facilities.     But from the nature of the oase. railway traffic in this country is vulnerable to attack by road competition since the distances over which the traffic is hauled, are comparatively short.     For general merchandise in 1925 the average length of haul for all the railway companies in Great Britain was only 87.17 miles and for mineral traffios, other than coal, coke and patent fuel, 53.57 miles.     The average distance travelled by ordinary third-class passengers on the main line railways is about 18 miles and by workmen 6 miles and for all classes of passenger traffic 14 miles.     In a country where nearly half the population lives within 15 miles of one of the larger ports, it is obvious that transport by sea and by road combined now subjects the railway companies to severe competition at every point,(5)   Scope of road services to be maintained by railway companies In view of the changed position publio opinion no doubt regards the Railway Companies&apos; case for claiming more extensive powers to operate services by road as much stronger than it was in 1922 when the matter was last before Parliament.     The business of carrying traffic by road is so closely associated with other branches of railway business end in particular with the already authorised business of collection and delivery of traffic whioh is intended to pass or has already passed by rail, that there should be considerable scope for effecting economy and for providing convenient facilities if in certain directions road services were developed in the hands of the Railway Companies as a business anoillary to their railways.There are numerous instances in which a road passenger servioe connecting with the arrival or departure of trains might reasonably be conducted by the railway company itself and through-bookings arranged.
-s- 63There are also certain tourist facilities by a oombined use of railways and roads which a railway company may legitimately undertake.As regards freight services new developments which in the past would have been provided in the shape of light railways can now be more advantageously provided on the roads by or In connexion with existing railway services.     There are also oases in which the railway line between tv/o places follows a oircuitous route and in which it might be advantageous that the railway oom-pany should be able to follow the &quot;base of the triangle&quot; by the institution of a road servioe.     There are other oases in which unnecessary handling or congested terminals could be avoided. There are certain traffics which oan be conveyed by lorry with much less expenditure on packing than if the same consignments have to be handled by rail.     Then again there are oases in whioh a manufacturer may wish the whole of his traffic to be dealt with by one transport Agency and some of It by road:   a railway company would be at a disadvantage in competing for business of this kind if it were not in a position to offer a road service where that is the most economical and expeditious mode of transporting a particular commodity.     There oould be no reasonable objection raised in any quarter if   a railway oompany were authorised to embark upon the institution of road services within these limits.     It may be that, even if the railway companies are accorded the wide powers which they seek, they will not exercise them in a wholesale manner.     It is perhaps significant that the London and North Eastern Railway Company, which already possesses extensive powers over a substantial part of its area, has not hitherto exercised those powers in order to protect itself against the competition of the roads but has in faot reduced the number of motor passenger vehicles in the Group since 1913 from 91 to 43 while its motor goods vehicles have only been increased from 36 to 249, and
these must be used mainly for the ordinary services of collection end delivery.A good deal of the opposition which was raised against the proposals of the Eorth Western Group in 1922 was based upon the fear that the Railway Company applying its powers would so exercise them as to involve it in large saale operations by road in competition with existing road carriers and, indeed, with their own railway business.     Those fears were not without foundation sinoe the Promoters would have left themselves in the position of being obliged to aocept a large volume of existing railway traffic by road if their own proposals had been approved.     In the first place they put themselves under a variety of obligations appro-priate to a railway undertaking in the matter of faoilities, etc but which were not equally appropriate and must have proved unduly-hampering to a road undertaking, and in the second place they proposed a basis of charge for their road services which would have involved a cut throat competition with their own railway. The present Bills do not make these embarrassing proposals.Traders who use the railways may, however, still have some misgivings as to the possibility of a transfer of traffic from railway to road services as a result of the grant of further powers and the basis of any suoh misgivings perhaps requires examination.     If the traffic carried by road has irretrievably become road traffic, then no doubt it may be argued that there is no reason why a railway company should not devote capital end energy to earning by the conduct of a road service such a return as can be obtained from the same operation by other investors. It has also been argued on the ether hand that there is no reason why a statutory undertaking entrusted with one form of transport should enlarge its primary function and embark its resources and energies upon another form of transport merely for the sake of earning an average rate of return upon money invested in industry.     &quot;This contention of carriers by road ie an interested one and not one which it is thought is likely to oarry weight.     But where there is a real alternative to a
railway oompany as to the mode of transport which  can be adopted, there is a very great advantage In carrying tho traffic by rail. This results from the fact that a large proportion of railway expenditure is a fixed or standing expenditure whioh does not vary proportionately with an increase or decrease of business. Thus, for example, if by the creation of a new service a railway oompany were able to earn  100 of gross revenue in oarrying traffic by road, it might retain  5,  10 or even  SO as profit.     If, however, it could add to its revenue from railway working  100 of gross revenue by oarrying the same traffic by rail, it might hope to retain in the shape of profit and contribution to overhead charges a very much larger proportion of the earnings from the &quot;marginal&quot; traffic.     In other words. If the volume of traffic carried by rail oan be increased, the burden not only of what are generally known as overhead charges but of the expenditure upon maintenance of the permanent way, eto.,   and to some extent the maintenance of rolling stock is     diminished in respect of all traffic oarried by rail.     Diminution in the volume of railway traffic similarly throws an increased burden in respect of the same items upon the remaining traffic and this would still be the case even if the road service paid its own way.The operation of the Railways Act lends importance, as was felt in 1922, to the effect of the road operations of a railway company upon its net revenue.     If a railway company oonduots a road service at a loss or transfers traffic from rail to road it may be doing so at the expense of the trader who is required to pay railway charges on a basis which will yield a specified standard revenue. This standard revenue is composed of the net receipts of 1913, together with allowances for new oapital and for capital whioh has not fully fructified, and the charges for rail borne traffic have to yield this sum, plus the expenses of management and operation, less the net receipts from ancillary businesses and miscellaneous sources.     It follows that unless the new road services contribute sufficiently to net revenue to compensate for any diminution in the volume of
railway traffic, the maintenance of standard revenue would tend to entail a greater burden on coal and other heavy traffic which cannot readily be diverted from rail to road.Mo complete safeguards oan be devised which will ensure that there ie no diversion of traffic from the railway as a result of the establishment of road services by railway companies, but it may be reasonably assumed that the railway companies will in fact so operate and limit their road services as to oonduoe to the best financial advantage of their under-taking as a whole and the cumulative effeot of the partial aefeguards which can be adopted should be substantial.     It is also fair to point out that there may be a substantial volume of trafflo which Bailway Companies can attract or, if it be new traffic, secure, by the institution of profitable road services and which it could not retain or obtain as rail traffic.     To that extent the railway user might actually benefit and seoure out of tho general revenues of the undertaking some contribution in relief of his burdens.In any case, it must be left to the railway companies, if they are challenged, to satisfy Parliament that in seeking power to establish businesses which must of necessity be potentially competitive with the railways, they see their way to conduct such businesses aa services complimentary to the railways rather than as alternative means of transport and to avoid the danger of railway traffic being uneconomically diverted to road services.

APPENDIX II. Detailed Safeguards *Approval of ttoutes and Delimitation of Areas.The grounds for restriction of routes are: (a) To protect the roads against unnecessary wear and tear.   This consideration could not equitably be enforced against railway-owned services only,    (b) To prevent the establishment of services on routes already sufficiently served with a view to conserving the economic resources of the country.   Insistence on this consideration would largely defeat the objects of the proposals. There is, however, (c) a special point where the ground for restriction may be held tc be stronger.   The companies propose to define the area within which eaoh company is to be authorised to operate as any district to which its system affords access. It is possible that one Railway Company might compete directly or indirectly with another by means of a road service and though it may be said that wasteful competition of this kind will be restrained by agreement, machinery may be required to enable disputes to te determined.   The Railway Companies do not themselves suggest this, but if thought necessary any railway company could be given the right of objecting to a service instituted by another railway company as being unduly competitive with it3 own business and the kinister or some judicial body could be given power to order a service to be discontinued on this ground but on no ctner.   as the object of these provisions v.would be to ensure that the possibility of obtaining standard revenue was not prejudiced by wasteful competition between railway companies, it would not be neoessary to give road competitors other than railway companies any right of appeal on this particular point, though it would probably be demanded.   On the whole, however, I would rather make no proposal on this point and so avoid the difficulty of resisting the  claim of other carriers by road to be heard and the further difficulties which would result if a general power to disallow a service ware imposed on the -Department or the Railway and Canal Commission.
It might however be useful to insert a clause in the Bills requiring the Companies to furnish schedules of the routes or areas upon or in which they establish road services, so that the scope of their operations may be known and available as material for any general inquiry.As regards passenger services, railways should conform to the general lav/, regulations and procedure applicable, whether In London or elsewhere, to vehicles engaged in such busine s s. Charge s.The necessity for instituting a direct control of charges will be urged from two points of view:-Cl)    It will be said that there is a risk that the charges made by Railway Companies for conveyance by road will be too high, especially if the Companies eventually succeed in establishing a substantial monopoly.   The reasons for taking the view that monopolistic charges are not likely in fact bo be established have already been stated.   Public opinion will, however, probably require some safeguards on this point.   Any attempt to lay down maximum charges would be futile,   a statutory maximum oharge for a commercial service of which the conditions change rapidly is bound to be unsatisfactory. Actual approval of charges, whether by the Minister or by some Tribunal, is equally open to objection,   protection could, however, be afforded against unduly high charges by a general provision to the effect that the Companies may make reasonable charges for the services which they undertake and that any interested trader is to have a right of appeal to the Railway Rates Tribunal on the point of reasonableness.   This is in fact the proposal embodied in the draft Bill prepared by the Companies.    Control over fares does not seem to be ne ce s sary.
(2)    It will be said, on the other hand, that charges may be too low in the sense that they are inadequate to the cost of rendering the service or are unduly competitive.   The argument would be that the railway companies with their great resources will be able to quote uneconomic rates which will drive their competitors out of business.   To meet this line of opposition, the Tribunal could be given power to disallow any charge which they considered to be unduly low but ifs simpler and probably sufficient safeguard could, it is thou&amp;ut, be readily provided by the application and extension of theSnprinciple laid down in the Railways Act which required tho Rates Tribunal on reviewing railway charges to have regard to the financial results obtained from the operation of businesses ancillary and subsidiary to those railways.   This would also protect the railway user from having to make good in the shape of railway charges any losses which a Railway Company might incur on its road services.    If the Tribunal is satisfied that the net revenue resulting from an ancillary   business is, having regard to all the circumstances unduly low, they may make such deductions as they think proper from the railway charges which would otherwise have been fixed.   The hailway Companies have incorporated a clause on these lines so far as services which they own and operate themselves are concerned.    Tho Tribunal could further be directed to satisfy itself that the Company was not employing its funds in connexion with other undertakings which it did not itself own so as to jeopardise the realisation of standard revenue, and would thus bo able to have regard to the effect of services established under the Bill upon existing railway traffic and the net revenue derived therefrom. Publication of Rstosj.The Report of the Committee of 1921, signed by the Chdirman, recommended that Railway Companies carrying by road should be required to publish their (merchandise) charges in the same way as they are required to publish those for conveyance
by rail.   The draft Bill aoes not provide for publication ofrates and the Companies object to the principle.    But clearlyif the appeal to the Tribunal is to be a reality, tradersmust have ready means of finding out authoritatively the rates in oroe,and it is considered that a clause should be Inserted accordingly.Facilities.There would seem to be no adequate reason why, if railway companies are permitted to carry traffic by road, they should, any more than anyone else, be compelled to provide reasonable facilities for such traffic, either generally or on the routes where they do in fact carry.    If any such obligations were imposed upon railway companies and were to be effective, the result would be that the railway companies1 road services would be either more extensive or more frequent, or more expensively equipped, or that their unsuccessful services would be continued longer, than would otherwise have been the case. The Railway Companies might also be forced into maintaining road services which would unnecessarily compete with their railways.Facilities for Mails.The Postmaster-General will doubtless press for the Conveyance of kails Act to be made applicable to railway companies1 road services, as is always done when Parliament grants statutory transport powers.   The railway companies will not object. Undue Preference.The question whether Railway Companies should be prohibited from granting undue preference in connexion with their road services stands on rather a different footing from the question whethey they should be required to afford reasonable road service facilities but it is one which the traders can perhaps be left to raise.
Accounts and Returns and financial provisions.It is upon the provisions under this head that the protection of other Transport Agencies against unfair eompetition and users of the railways in respect of railv/ay charges must mainly depend.   As already explained the direction to the Tribunal contained in the Railways Act, 1921, Section 59, as regards ancillary businesses generally is to the effect that &quot;if satisfied that the net revenue resulting therefrom is, having regard to all the circumstances, unduly low&quot;, they may reduce the railway charges which would otherwise have been fixod.   The business of conducting road services will differ from other ancillary businesses (with the negligible exception of canals) in importing an element of competition with the railway Itself.    It might, therefore, be suggested that the Tribunal might ba required instead of empowered to make a deduction from railway charts in the circumstances mentioned but dxfficulties would probably result from undue rijidity. The Companies are understood to agree in principle that the Tribunal should include in their review the financial results to the Railway Companies of any investments in road transport undertakings or of any guarantees or working agreements into which they may enter.On the form of the account, a difficulty arises in connexion with the existing and extensive service of Collection and Delivery of Merchandise whioh is to be or has been carried by rail,   Any accounts previously rendered in respect of these services show a heavy loss, partly to be off-set no doubt by speoial advantages in handling the traffic.   Under the Railways Act, 1921, a right of appeal Is given as to the reasonableness of cnarges for this service.   The persons who avail themselves of it would appear to have a right to adequate informatlon uncon-fused by the results of a long distance road service which is different in character.    It. is thought, therefore, that a
/separation of the &quot;Collection and Delivery&quot; service from the purely road services should be required-   This will involve a&apos; scheme of apportionment of certain items of account but it should not be impracticable to provide the necessary rules.   This the Railway Companies appear to agree.   It is also a question whether the results of services in different areas should not be separately available and separately considered by the Tribunal if any effective control is to be exercised.Freight and passenger services, and horse and motor services would naturally be distinguished.The details of the form of account and of the statistical returns of traffic are .of a technical character and will have to be discussed in due course with the officers of the railway companies.    If power is given to railway companies to enter into agreements with general carriers, they should be required to show the exxent to which they have become financially interested in other companies in their published accounts in detail and should show also the return which they get from such investments.   They contend that in each case it will suffice if they show an aggregate figure but demand may arise for information as to the results of particular arrangements and the Tribunal at least should have power to call for these details. General *(a) Publication of Agreements betwoen Railway companies and Reneral carriers&quot;!It is further for consideration whether it might benecessary for the Rates Tribunal to be acquainted with the termsof these agreements when revising railway charges.   Apart fromany necessity for requiring publication from this point of view,it is suggested that these contracts are private arrangements which need not be made public so long, at any rate, as agreements between independent road oarriers are not required to bepublished.
The case would be met if the Companies were required to lodge copies of all agreements with the Minister, who should be at liberty to communicate them to the Tribunal. (bJ accidento and Safety.The existing legislation relating to railway accidents and the prevention of accidents to railway employees will not, broadly speaking, apply to railway companies1 road services.    Such accidents, again broadly speaking, only fall within the scope of the Railway Regulation Acts if they occur on railway premises in connection with railway working.    It is not suggested that any special provision with regard to these matters need be made.   They should be dealt ;;ith in due course in legislation relating to road vehicles generally.(c) wages and Conditions of Employment.This is a matter primarily for the Ministry of Labour, but no special provisions would seem to be required. The wages and  conditions of employment of the operating staff employed direct by the railway companies will be subject to the wages Boards procedure, and the repairing staff by the procedure applicable to railway shopmen.(d) Byelaws and Regulations.Although it would not be a direct safeguard to the public, it would be an advantage to the railway companies to have power to make byelaws for regulating the travelling and for the prevention of nuisances in or upon tneir road vehicles oarrying passengers.   Such powers are usually granted to local authorities when statutory powers to run omnibuses are conferred upon them, and there would be no objection to granting similar powers to railway companies.    If tne Road Traffic Bill becomes law the point would be covered,   i&amp;eanwnile the Railway Companies have included in their Bills a clause which can be accepted.It would, in some respects also be of advantage if railway companies were to be given some power to make byelaws regulating the carriage by road vehicles of merchandise traffic
in certain respects, such as, for example, the conveyance of explosives and dangerous gooes.    It would seem, however, that provisions of this kind must wait until they can &quot;be oealv with in connexion with road traffic generally.(e) A clause appears in the Bill providing for the application of the general law.    The drafting of this clause will require careful examination.It will also he necessary to clear up the position which would arise if the existing powers enjoyed by certain of the Companies in certain areas and which are not in all respects identical with those now proposed to be taken were to continue in operation.    It has been suggested to the Companies that they should schedule these powers with a view to their repeal.   Their Bills should also show clearly which of the provisions, if any, are intended to apply to the service of collection and delivery or to the conveyance of railway pa ssengers to or from the railway.(f) Extension of Railway Companies1 Obligations to Carriers working :.n connexion with hailway Companies *Some of the safeguards required (e.g. those relating to standard revenue) will necessarily apply only to railway companies, and it would seem to be sufficient if some of the others (e.g. those relating to accounts and returns and publication of agreements i were similarly to be made applicable only to railway companies.   But safeguards intended to confer rights on members of the public might beoome illusory if they applied only to railway companies and the railway companies were able to arrangs with independent carriers for the actual working of their road traffiic.It does not seem possible to draw up any satisfactory definition of the types of agreement or understanding or arrangement between railway companies and independent carriers that should involve the extension to the latter of the obligations
-s-which the railway companies would have been under if they had themselves been the carriers.   In the circumstances, the better course may be not to attempt a precise definition but merely to provide that the provisions in question shall, in so far as they are applicable, apply to traffic carried unaer the provisions of the Act.Cg) fcanufacture by Kailviay Companies.It is understood that, in order to placate manufacturing interests, the Railway Companies are likely to insert in their Bills a clause debarring them from the right to manufacture road vehicles.   This is not a matter upon -which comment need be made in reporting to Parliament.
