[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Copy No.      30MEMORANDUM.I SAW Sarwat Pasha again after the meeting of the Cabinet Committee yesterday. I told him that I was not yet in a position to hand him the definite text of a draft treaty, but that, after discussion with the Egypt Committee, I was personally sanguine that, provided he could meet me on certain points which I would Jay before him, the. draft which we had discussed together would in the end prove acceptable. I laid stress on the fact that this was only my personal opinion and that he must not treat it as in any sense a Cabinet decision.With this preliminary, I first raised Lord Balfour&apos;s point that the right to appeal to the Council at intervals of five years given by clause 6 should be attributed to Great Britain if the decision were adverse to her, as well as to Egypt in like case. To my surprise, Sarwat Pasha definitely rejected this suggestion. He said that Egypt&apos;s hope was that in the course of time we should trust her as we trusted a Dominion and should be prepared to leave her defence by land entirely in her own hands. This, however, was an aspiration which they were prepared to leave to time and our decision. They asked an appeal to the League only on the question of the distribution of troops, and particularly as to their continued occupation of Cairo. They were prepared to postpone any appeal on this subject for ten years and again for five years if the Council decided against it, but to say that, if at any time, the Council reached the conclusion that their request ought to be granted, that decision should again be subject to review in the opposite sense, was a proposition that no Egyptian could accept. They were willing to make any progress conditional on the appeal to the Council, but they could not accept the proposition that progress if and when made should be subject to reversal. After considerable discussion, I left this point and proceeded to the second.I asked that the facilities accorded by the Annex Part I, paragraph (d) for a period of ten years should be continued as long as the present distribution of the troops was maintained, and that, in the event of its being decided by agreement or by the Council that our troops were to be withdrawn to the Canal Zone, similar accommodation and facilities should be provided in that zone by the Egyptian Government. Sarwat remarked that this was a question of money and he would not dispute on finance.   He accepted the addition.I then took together the proposal that Egyptian munitions should be purchased only in Great Britain and that the Egyptian forces should be limited to 12,250 all ranks.   Upon these two points I found Sarwat Pasha unshakable.   As regards the purchase of the munitions, he repeated that there would have been no difficulty but for the fact that we had held up supplies which had actually been promised.   As regards a limitation of the numbers of the Egyptian army, he contended with no little force that this was a strange provision to put into a treaty of alliance which, if it meant anything, should mean that the strength of one ally was the strength of the other.    He contended, further, that, thus fashioned, the treaty, instead of increasing the freedom cf Egypt, restricted the powers which she already possessed. We had in 1914 of our own free will withdrawn this restriction and informed the Egyptian Government that henceforth no such restriction would be enforced.   It was, therefore, a reversal of policy as well as a startling indication of lack of confidence.    I pressed his Excellency very hard on this point.    I gave him to understand that, in my opinion, unless he could meet me at least upon the limitation of numbers, our whole work would be jeopardised.   My arguments were reinforced by Sir William Tyrrell, whom I had associated with me, and he laid particular stress upon the criticism which His Majesty&apos;s Government would have to meet in Parliament if they had agreed to the indefinite extension of the numbers of the Egyptian army as well as to its being rendered efficient in training and equipment. We were quite unable to shake Sarwat Pasha.    He said with evident conviction that it was useless for him to offer me such an undertaking, as neither he nor any man could secure Egyptian concurrence in it.   I had the conviction that he would have given way on this point if he could, but that he felt that by so doing he would&quot; 4184   [167S8]SECRET.CP. 263 (27).
destroy all chances of his securing the approval of the treaty in Egypt. The Cabinet will in the last resort have to decide whether they will insist on overloading a willing horse. I did not, however, abandon the point, and towards the close of a long discussion and seizing upon an argument suggested by Sir William Tyrrell, I urged upon Sarwat Pasha that he might concede, as it were, to the League of Nations what he could not accept simply as a limitation imposed by us, and I proposed to him some such formula as the following: In view of the efforts of the League of Nations to arrive at a reduction or, at least, at a limitation of armaments, and in view of the measure of security acquired by Egypt by reason of this alliance, the Government of Egypt has fixed at a maximum of 12,250 the number of the effectives of their armed forces, which number should not be exceeded without previous agreement with the British Government.I argued that such a clause was in exact conformity with the whole trend of League opinion, with the decisions of the recent Assembly and with the work of the Preparatory Commission, that it would make a favourable impression upon the League just at the moment when Egypt would be seeking admittance as a member, and that the concession made in this way to the League and the number chosen being stated, as what in fact it was, the choice of the Egyptian Government, it could imply no indignity to Egypt and must be capable of being made acceptable to Egyptian public opinion.Eor the first time whilst discussing this question Sarwat Pasha hesitated. I cannot say that he gave me any encouragement to think that he could accept the proposition even thus stated, but he was not quite as definite in declining it as he had been in regard to any idea of limitation by treaty up to that point. If it should be found possible for us to make this clause mutual and to apply in the same way and for the same reasons a limitation to the number of our effectives, there is just a possibility that he might accept it. This, however, is a proposition that I did not feel authorised even to suggest to him in view of the great uncertainty as to our own attitude in which the discussions of the committee had left me.I should add that I obtained from Sarwat Pasha the acceptance of the amend-ment to Annex 1 (a), which Lord Lloyd again pressed for in the committee.Reviewing the conversation as a whole again this morning, I should say that I so entirely concealed my own opinion, and that I pressed these points so urgently and insistently upon Sarwat Pasha, that there is some danger lest he should be driven to over-tax his strength and so to load the treaty with precautions and conditions as to destroy his powrer to carry it. Lord Lkryd, in speaking to me of our relations with Egypt, has again and again declared that the two most important things from our point of view were a military alliance and a Monroe doctrine for the exclusion of foreign influence. Both these objects are attained in full measure by the treaty in the form which Sarwat Pasha has already accepted. We have, in addition, the guarantee that Egyptian foreign policy shall be so conducted as not to run counter to British interests; we are given the indefeasible title to maintain troops in Egypt in perpetuity; our representative is given a perpetual precedence over the representa-tives of all other Powers; the Canal Zone is closed, also in perpetuity, to the military or civil air forces of other nations, whilst open to our own, and it is recognised as the duty of the Egyptian Government to consult us at once if any circumstance arises likely to imperil the good relations of Egypt with a foreign Power, or to endanger the lives or property of foreigners in Egypt. When it is within our power to obtain so much, I cannot believe that we should be justified, in the interests of our own country, in endangering the whole agreement by excessive demands, or that, when the facts became known, public opinion would support us in such an attitude.A. C.Foreign Office, November 8, 1927.
