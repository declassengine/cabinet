HlSjjOCUjgggg 13 THE.....PROPERTY OF. HIS :BHia?AKNlC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT) .COPY NOo Lf?COMMITTEE OP IMPERIAL DEFENCE, CHIEFS 0? STAFF S&apos;J3-C0MfflTT5S.Draft treaty of alliance b:?tt-::en great BritainAND EGYPT&quot;   TPaper Ho. COoS. 109). Memorandum by the First Sea Lord.The time available has been too short to review the Draft Anglo-Egyptian Treaty in all its bearings, but looking chiefly to the future security of the Suez Canal, our main route to India,  our Eastern Dominions, and the Pacific, it is very unsatisfactory.Article VI.It is suggested that Article VI should be modified to provide that when His Britannic Majesty Is at war, Egypt shall also be at war.      This would be in accordance with the proposed arrangement between the United States of America and Panama,  and it would safeguard our Military Forces from being interned if Egypt ?&apos;ere to remain neutral when His Britannic Majesty was at war with another Power.Article VII.Artile VII implies that the Governments Intention Is to entrust the protection of the Canal at some future time to the King of Sgjpt and Egyptian Forces.     So far as can be foreseen,  it will never be safe to do so, and I suggest that the words between&quot;and pending&quot; and &quot;this protection&quot; be omitted.The second part of Article VII is hardly less dangerous.      It gives to Egypt and the League of Nations; S 0 R ST. %a.Sj^ll2*
togother the right to dispose the British Forces whichare in Egypt for the defer.ce of our Imperial Highway, andthe object of this paragraph appears to be to enableEgypt to obtain authority to clear the British Forces outof Cairo,  and so to weaken our control over the egyptian government and the Canal.     I consider it - uiteinadmissible in its present foruuI further under stand that if tills question is brought before the League of Nations;  the Vote of the british delegates will net count, and the decision is there for every likely to be against usotheIt is also clear frcm/Foreign Secretary&apos;s Paper No.. CP. 25S(2r/f of 8th November,  1927, that Sarwat Pasha expects under the Treaty to be allowdd to raise an Army of any size and to arm it from any foreign scurce.This may commit us to a large Increase In the Military forces in Egypt and in the Soudan, and it is unnecessary to point cut that any doubt as to the security of the Canal route must bo follorsod by an Increase of Naval forces on both sides of the Sue* Isthmus, also the strengthening of Singapore to render it less dependent on home supplies and support.      It may possibly entail the basing of part of the Fleet at 35/ngapore, to secure our Eastern interests during the passage of the main fleet and its supplies to the Hast by the Cape Route.Further, our Cruiser, Destroyer and Submarine strength must be reviewed directly there Is a doubt as to the security of our communications via the Canal.To sum up.     The Admiralty Staff are of the opinion that the Draft Treaty will greatly increase our responsi-bilities in Egypt,  jeopardize oar route to the East, and may add largely In the near future to the Naval Estimates.(So.) CHARLES E0 MADDEN,. Admiral of the Fleet.Admxra.&apos;vV/yc9th November,, 1927.xAlso Paper Ho,  CCS.110.
