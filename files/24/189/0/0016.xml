C0L3.!UivIS2S in memorandum hy the first Lord of the admiralty.At the meeting on Jtino 1st, 1927, (Cabinet Conclusions 55) the Cahinot agreed upon the following policy in dealing with communists employed under Government Departments :-(a) Persons who can be shown by reasonable evidence to be actively engaged in the dissemination of anti-constitutional and revolutionary propaganda, either oral or written, should be discharged forthwith and without pension or other superannua-tion benefit,(b) Persons who merely label themselves as communists without taking any active part in the furtherance of communism should be eliminated as and when opportunity offers, i.e. by discharge on reduction.Ho public announcement of this policy has yet beenmade, and it would appear to have been the intention of theCabinet that the foregoing rules should be applied forthwith,without making any such announcement.    Some difficulty hasbeen experienced,   however, in proceeding on these lines in actual cases which have been brought to notice, and questionsof equity and expediency have arisen on which a Cabinet rulingi3 desired.A typical case is that of a workman of long servicev and good record as a workman, who is reliably reported to be a &quot;well-known active communist&quot;, to have been associated with communism for 3oae years, and to have ta2-:on the chair at public meetings where coismunism was advocated, but who has not com-, mitted himself in such a way as to become liable to prosecution at lav;.   Presumably, this man would come under category (a) abovet and should be discharged forthwith without pension or other benefit.    On the other hand, no public announcementhaving /
