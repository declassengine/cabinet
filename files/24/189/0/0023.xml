At their Meeting on November 17th,  1927,  the Cabinet Committee on China had under consideration the attached Report of the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee dealing with the question of operations against the Bogue and Dane&apos;s Island Forts near Canton.2.     The Conclusions reached by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee are as follows  :-(a) That provided the necessary forces are concentrated for the purpose, the capture and demolition of the Bogue and Dane&apos;s Island Forts is a feasible military operation.(b) In order to ensure success, the attacks on both systems of forts should be simultaneous, and should be carried out in such a way as to ensure surprise in both cases.     We lay particular emphasis on this latter point in view of the suggestion in Sir Miles Lampson&apos;s telegram, No. 1563,- of the 4th November, 1927, that &quot;the very knowledge that such preparations are being made should have additional deterrent effect&quot;.     Any such leakage would seriously militate against the chances of success.(c) Having regard to the military consequences of possible reactions in other parts of China, we suggest that the proposed operations are Inadvisable.3.     The Committee on China agreed -To recommend for the approval of the Cabinet the conclusions of the Report of the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee on operations against the ^-Bogus and Dane&apos;s Island Forts.(Signed) T.

[This Document is the Property of His Britannic majesty&apos;sGovernment.]Printed for the Committee of Imperial Defence.   November 1927.SECRET.Copy No. 60C.O.S. 111.(Also C.I.D. Paper No. 841-B and CP. 273 (27).)COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee.CHINA :  OPERATIONS AGAINST THE BOGTJE AND DANE&apos;SISLAND FORTS.REPORT.WE met on Tuesday, the 8th November, 1927, at the request of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, to consider Foreign Office Telegrams No. 1563 of the 4th November, from Sir Miles Lampson (Peking), and No. 603 of the 6th November, Foreign Office to Sir Miles Lampson, on the subject of possible action against the Bogue and Dane&apos;s Island Forts. The above telegrams are attached as Appendix No. I to this Report.A description of the Bogue and Dane&apos;s Island defences is given in Appendix No. II to this Report. The two systems of defences are separated by about 23 miles of river, a distance wrhich weuld involve approximately six hours&apos; steaming for the conveyance of troops in river steamers from one system to the other. The Bogue defences could be engaged by the biggest ships on the China Station mounting 7-5-inch guns and less, while the Dane&apos;s Island defences could, with some difficulty, be engaged by small cruisers mounting 6-inch guns, as well as by sloops, destroyers and gunboats.3. Summary of the Original Plan as Deduced from a Telegram^ from the General Officer Commanding, Hong Kong.The plan devised by the General Officer Commanding, Hong Kong, in consultation with the Rear-Admiral, 1st Cruiser Squadron, had already been examined under our instructions at the time of its receipt, and may be described briefly as follows : Firstly, a Surprise Attack on the Bogue Defences.After the seizure and demolition of the forts the military forces will be withdrawn into general reserve.2. Description of the Bogxie and Dane&apos;s Island Defences.Troops required 2% Battalions Infantry. 2&quot; Sections Pack Artillery. 7   Platoons of Marines.* No. 1393 of April 31, 1027.[16800]b
Secondly, the Destruction of the Dane&apos;s Island Defences.Troops required 2 Battalions of Infantry.2 Pack Batteries.1 4-5-inch Howitzer Battery.The above force would not commence its passage up river until the Bogue Forts had been actively engaged, thus giving approximately six hours&apos; warning to the defences of Dane&apos;s Island and necessitating the approach thereto being carried out in daylight. In the interval between the attack on the Bogue Defences and the attack on Dane&apos;s Island the necessary reconnaissance would be effected by means of aerial photography, it being contemplated that any such reconnaissance carried out previous to the attack against the Bogue Forts would vitiate the chances of securing surprise in this attack.   Surprise at Dane&apos;s Island was not anticipated.4. Considerations Affecting the Proposed Operations.(i.) Since the plan summarised above was formulated we understand that the territory concerned has all been reconnoitred either by close range observation or by being actually walked over. The lack of previous reconnaissance therefore no longer-renders simultaneous surprise attacks on the Bogue and Dane&apos;s Island Defences impossible.(ii.) The attack upon the Bogue Forts only, in the first instance, is in our view a feasible operation, but it will have to be followed by an attack on the Dane&apos;s Island Forts at a later date when the defences there would have been strengthened. Otherwise, the strengthened defences at Dane&apos;s Island could be used to prevent freedom of movement up river to Canton, thus adversely affecting Shameen, the military situation of which would be that of an isolated garrison in the heart of an enemy territory.(iii.) An attack cm&apos;the Dane&apos;s Island Forts at a later date would be inadvisable, since the possibility of obtaining surprise as to the actual moment of attack would hardly compensate for the increased resistance to be anticipated. Moreover, the defences at Dane&apos;s Island are as strong as the Bogue Defences and more difficult to get at.(iv.) There are sufficient naval forces at present on the China station to carry out the operations under consideration, provided the Commander-in-Chief was prepared to concentrate them at Hong Kong for this purpose. Such a concentration would, however, necessitate the absence of the Commander-in-Chief and all his cruisers (except the &apos;&apos; Curlew,&quot; which is locked up at Hankow) from the Yangtse for several weeks.(v.) Subject to the state of the river, which can only be known locally, it would be possible, provided pilots were employed, for destroyers to proceed by night as far as Canton and for cruisers to proceed as far as Belcher Creek, but on account of the narrowness of the river at this point not more than two cruisers could be placed so as to carry out an effective fire against the defences of Dane&apos;s Island. Simultaneous attacks, each accompanied by the requisite condition of surprise, are therefore susceptible of being mounted against both the Bogue and Dane&apos;s Island systems.(vi.) Owing to the reduction of our military forces in China the troops necessary to carry out the operations contemplated could not be provided without leaving insufficient troops at Shanghai to deal with emergencies which might arise at Hankow or other places on the Yangtse.(vii.) The air forces available to co-operate in an attack on the defences of Dane&apos;s Island are insufficient to secure a continuous bombardment, having regard to the fact that they would have to operate from an aerodrome some 60 miles distant.5. Reactions.Before operations against the Bogue and Dane&apos;s Island Defences are authorised we think it advisable to point out the possible consequences which may follow such a course. Definite steps will have to be taken either to (a) evacuate, or (6) reinforce the Shameen. One of these alternative courses must be adopted since the failure of the attack on either the Bogue or Dane&apos;s Island Defences would leave the Shameen a hostage in the hands of the Chinese.  In this connection we think it well to draw
attention to the following extracts from a previous Report by us on the situation j&amp;4 Canton in January, 1927 (C J.D. Paper No. 759-B) :-&quot; (a.) Any action taken with regard to Shameen, which involves military consequences, will have to be taken in co-operation with, and with the prior agreement of, the French, who have a definite share in the foreign concession.&quot; (6.) The evacuation of Shameen will almost certainly involve its looting and possibly its destruction by the Cantonese.&quot; (c.) The institution of a blockade without the evacuation of Shameen will almost certainly produce a demand for military protection. If this demand is to be met, a garrison of two companies of infantry, with machine guns, and two sections of pack artillery is considered the minimum that could safeguard itself and also the concession.&quot; (d.) Owing to navigational difficulties, a garrison in Shameen could quite easily be cut off and marooned.&quot; (e.) If Shameen is cut off from the outside world, a combined naval, military and air operation would have to be undertaken to relieve it. It is not impossible that such an operation would land us in extensive commitments.&quot; (/.) The operation described in (e) would constitute an act of war against China.&quot; (g.) Unless His Majesty&apos;s Government is prepared to face the above liabilities, the evacuation of Shameen should be a necessary preliminary to the institution of a blockade.&quot;Although the above observations were made in connection with the possible institution of a blockade of Canton they apply equally in the present case, except in so far as (/) above is concerned, since the contemplated attack on the river defences would in&apos; itself constitute an act of war against China. Such an act of wrar, even if attended with success locally, might cause unknown reactions in other parts of China, notably in the Yangtse Valley, to deal with which we might have insufficient military forces available.6. We understand that the local authorities have already been authorised to stop boats employed on picketing duties, and, if necessary, to take steps for the seizure and immobilisation of Chinese shipping in the port and waterways of Canton until such time as the boycott has been terminated. It is open to question whether the contemplated operations against the river defences, even if successful, would prove to be any more effective in bringing pressure to bear on persons actually engaged in the boycott than the steps enumerated above.Conclusions.7.   We therefore come to the following conclusions : (a.) That provided the necessary forces are concentrated for the purpose, the capture and demolition of the Bogue and Dane&apos;s Island Forts is a feasible military operation.(b.) In order to ensure success, the attacks on both systems of forts should be simultaneous, and should be carried out in such a way as to ensure surprise in both cases. We lay particular emphasis on this latter point in view of the suggestion in Sir Miles Lampson&apos;s telegram, No. 1563, of the 4th November, 1927, that &quot; the very knowledge that such preparations are being made should have additional deterrent effect.&quot; Any such leakage would seriously militate against the chances of success.(c.) Having regard to the military consequences of possible reactions in other parts of China, we suggest that the proposed operations are inadvisable.(Signed) H.  TRENCHARD.CHARLES E. MADDEN. G. F.

Appendix No. I. (1.)Copy of a Decypher telegram from Sir M. Lampson (Peking), No. 1563, dated november 4, 1927.(Immediate.)Canton telegram No. 96 to me.1. I am referring His Majesty&apos;s Consul-General at Canton to your telegram No. 542 to me, and authorising him to take immediate action accordingly at his discretion in consultation with naval authorities.2. If we deal with this attempt firmly and at once, it may fizzle out. Mean-while, we should make due preparations for further action (seizure of Whampoa and Bogue forts and immobilization of trade of the port by stopping Chinese shipping, &amp;c), in case it should prove necessary later. The very knowledge that such preparations are being made should have additional deterrent effect.&quot;There is only one way of dealing with these people, and that is to be firm with them.   It pays every time.Addressed to Foreign Office, No. 1563, repeated to Canton, Hong Kong and Commander-in-Chief.(2.)Copy of a Cypher telegram to Sir M. Lampson (Peking), No. 603, dated november 6, 1927.(Immediate.)Your telegram No. 1563 of 4th November : Canton boycott.I approve your action in authorising Mr. Brenan to act at his discretion under authority conveyed to you in my telegram No. 542.2. If the measures contemplated in that telegram prove insufficient to enforce cessation of boycott, Mr. -Brenan may arrange with naval authorities for the seizure and immobilisation of Chinese shipping in the port and waterways of Canton until such time as he is satisfied that the boycott has been terminated.3. Except for cases covered by following paragraph 4, no action should be taken against the river defences, i.e., Whampoa and Bogue Forts, &amp;c, without specific authority from home. The question of such action is being considered by Chiefs of Staff and I will inform you of the result of their examination as soon as possible. My present information is that we have not sufficient military force available for such an operation.4. Commander-in-Chief may, of course, use the authority as regards retaliatory action conveyed in Admiralty telegrams Nos. 812 to 815, if contingencies covered by those instructions should arise.Repeat to Canton, Hong Kong, Commander-in-Chief and General Duncan.Appendix No. II. The Canton River Defences.The Bogue Defences.1.   The main armament of the Bogue Defences comprises : 8-24 cm. (9-6 in.) B.L. Krupp guns. 15-21 cm. (8 in.) B.L. Krupp guns. 11-15 cm. (6 in.) B.L. Krupp guns.3-10 inch M.L. guns.There are also several old iron M.L. guns mounted in beach batteries. These need not be considered as forming part of the defences.Tactically speaking, the Bogue defences command the entrance to the Canton River, which in the region of the forts is never wider than 3 miles; the deep water channel narrows to 800 yards opposite Wan-Tong.In August, 1926, two of the Bogue forts carried out target practice reported to be the first time for many, years.
Danes Island Defences.2.   The armament of the Dane&apos;s Island defences comprises : 13 guns on the left bank of the river (i.e., Yuchu and Ngau Shan forts). 12 or 16 guns on the Dane&apos;s Island. 7 or 9 guns on the right bank.As in the case of the Bogue Defences, the calibre of the guns varies between 24 cm. and 15 cm. The channels covered are enfiladed and are about 200 yards broad.3. Adjuncts to the Defences. On the Dane&apos;s Island is situated the Whampoa Academy, where cadets for the Cantonese Army are trained and Russian instructors are employed. There is also reported to be a mine depot, and the Cantonese are alleged to have an 80-foot motor-boat fitted as a mine-layer. In August, 1926, Canton ordered a complete minefield from Moscow, comprising 200 contact and observation mines.   Searchlights may exist.4. Condition of the Forts. In 1922 the forts were reported as being revetted with 6 or 7 feet of concrete; since then there is little doubt that the forts have fallen into disrepair, and even the concrete should not present serious resistance to H.E. shell. Some of the works are exposed on the land side to commanding hills well within rifle and machine-gun fire. The guns themselves are not of ultra-modern type and the mountings are not likely to be in good condition.5. Although there is an arsenal at Canton, it is not likely that up-to-date ammunition has been manufactured for the guns of the defences. Cartridges are of prism powder, and there are common shell with powder bursters.6. Personnel. No Cantonese troops have been trained as coast defence gunners, but there is little doubt that the Russian-trained Whampoa cadets are capable of fighting the guns in some sort of fashion.o
