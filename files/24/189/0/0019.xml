3T..269/(27).C A B I N 5 T.ROYAL COMMISSION ON MINING SUBSIDENCE.Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.----oOo----This Royal Commission, which was appointed in June 1923, has now presented its report (Cmd. 2899), and it Is desirable that consideration 3hould be given to the various recommendations. The attached schedule contains a summary of the recommendations, shows the Departments chiefly concerned, and gives some comments on those which affect the Board of Trade most directly.Upon those which raise legal questions, I hesitate to offer an opinion.    I would only say at this stage that the recommendation which appears to give an unlimited retrospective right of compensation to &quot;small&quot; property owners Is certainly&quot; novel and may be very unjust.It will be seen that several departments are concerned in the report, and I suggest therefore that an inter-departmental committee be set up; under the chairmanship of the Secretary for Mines, consisting of representatives of the Lord Chancellor&apos;s Department, the Ministry of Health, the Mines Department, the Scottish Office,  and also the Home Office,  if the Home Secretary considers this advisable.The Committee&apos;s terms of reference would be -&quot;To consider the recommendations contained in the second and final report of the Royal Commission on Mining Subsidence and advise what-action should be taken&quot; *F.C-L.copy NO.3uBoard of Trade,9th November, 1927,THIS DOCUMENT II THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY 1S GOV 51UMENT,

Ministry of Health, Scottish Office.This Research Association is understood to have been  * working in conjunction with the Institution of Mining Engineers, who have bean collecting information on the subject, and it is hoped to hold a meeting next month to consider this information in order to formulate a definite programme of research.   No Government action is necessary on this.   The Mines Depart-ment will keep in touch with developments.This would be a very short and simple piece of legisla-tion, but it is doubtful whether much importance is attached to it by the interests who are intended to benefit by it.It would, however, be necessary to ascertain from interests affected whether this is so.This new code for railways was brought Into being as a result of the Howley Park judgment, which made It clear that the old code in the Railway Clauses Consolidation Act, 1845, was inappropriate to the deeper mining of to-day, and that it gave an undue advantage     to the rail-w.ay companies.   The new code was the result of very lengthy negotiations with the railway companies, mine owners and royalty owners, and the Report suggests that similar negotia.* tions should now be initiated in regard to tho other Interests.The result would be for the benefit of the mine owners rather than the statutory undertakings affected and the Mining.Assoaiac.ion are being approached therefore in the first instance to see what importance they attach to it.1.
