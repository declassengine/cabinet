This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.&apos;   fj c from DPrinted for the Cabinet.SECRET. Copy No.CP. 269 (26).(Also C.I.D. Paper 705-B.)THE CONTROL OF AVIATION IN GERMANY.. Memorandum by the Secretary oe State for Air.1. THE control of aviation in Germany has, as my colleagues are aware, raised questions of considerable difficulty at intervals during the past few years, and they may wish therefore to have a brief account of the settlement recently arrived at in this regard between ourselves, the French, Italians, Belgians and Japanese on the one hand and the Germans on the other.2. In outline the position is that, so soon as Germany has honoured the under-takinge given by her in the Agreement signed at Paris on the 22nd May, 1926, the Aeronautical Committee of Guarantee, which has regulated aviation in Germany according to the provisions of the so-called &quot; Nine Rules &quot; since the withdrawal of the original Inter-Allied Aeronautical Commission of Control in May 1922, will disappear. In future the observance of the prohibition contained in Article 198 of the Treaty of Versailles against the maintenance by Germany of any naval or military air forces will be secured by domestic German legislation subject to such investigations as may from time to time be considered necessary by the Council of the League of Nations (see Article 213 of the Treaty of Versailles).3. This settlement is the fruit of months of patient negotiations, the course of which, owing to French and German intransigence, has been none too smooth.My policy throughout these negotiations has been that indicated in the memorandum which I circulated in December last (CP. 537 (25)). I have felt that, broadly speaking, we had a sufficient safeguard in French nervousness of anything likely to strengthen unduly Germany&apos;s power of offensive action, and that, as France is even more exposed to German attacks from the air than this country, we could agree to any concessions which the French were prepared to accept.4. The general scope of the projected German legislation to control the future development of aviation in Germany is explained in the accompanying memorandum by the Air staff.S. H.Air Ministry, June 29, 1926.Air Control in Germany.Article 198 of the Treaty of Versailles provides that &quot; the armed forces of Germany must not include any military or naval air forces.&quot; Compliance with this clause was secured until May 1922 by the Inter-Allied Aeronautical Commission, which supervised the air disarmament of Germany. When air disarmament was completed and the Commission withdrawn in May 1922, a semi-permanent organ of supervision, was established in the shape of the Aeronautical Committee of Guarantee, and certain rules, commonly kriown as the &quot; Nine Rules,&quot; were drawn up by the Allied Governments for the purpose of enabling that Committee to ensure that Article 198 was genuinely observed, and that a potential military air force was not maintained under the guise of civil aviation.The scheme for the Committee of Guarantee and the &quot; Nine Rules &quot; were referred to the German Government, with a note from the Conference of Ambassadors, on the 14th April, 1922, not for discussion but for acceptance as they stood. The German Government acknowledged their receipt on the 1st May, 1922, and undertook to take the necessary measures to enable the Committee of Guarantee to enter upon its functions as from the 5th May, 1922.The &quot;Nine Rules &quot; defined the kinds of aircraft which were to be regarded as military and therefore forbidden by the Treaty.    The first three Rules defined as [14772]
military all single-seaters with engines of more than 60 h.p. ; all pilotless aeroplanes ; all aeroplanes armoured in any way or fitted with gun or bomb mountings. The fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh rules laid down maximum limits, the capacity to exceed which would bring a machine within the military category ; these maxima were a &quot; ceiling &quot; of 4,000 metres ; a speed of 170 kilom. an hour at 2,000 metres altitude; oil and fuel carrying capacity in excess of a specified formula; useful load capacity in excess of 600 kilog. (including pilot, mechanic and instruments). The eighth and ninth rules provided for the declaration of factories of aeronautical material and the registration of machines and pilots, and for the restriction of stocks of engines, spare parts and accessories of engines to the quantities required for civil aviation. Another rule, not numbered, denned as military all airships exceeding the following cubic capacity : Cubic metres.Rigid dirigibles ... ... ... ... ...      30,000Semi-rigid dirigibles        ... ... ... ...       25,000Non-rigid dirigibles ... ... ... ...      20,000It was provided that the Rules should be revised every two years in accordance with the progress of aeronautical development, and revision thus became due in May 1924. Considerable discussion between the Allied Governments was found necessary in connection with the first revision, and the modifications considered permissible were communicated to Germany only on the 24th June, 1925. They provided for the increase of the maximum limits for speed from 170 to 180 kilom. an hour and for useful load from 600 to 900 kilog., for the rendering to the Committee of particulars of imports and exports of aeronautical material, and for certain other minor modifica-tions of the original Rules. The German Government has never signified its acceptance of these modifications, which fall far short of what that Government on its side had considered necessary.The scheme for the Committee of Guarantee provided that it should be continued until the date of the evacuation of the first zone of occupation in the Rhineland, and that the Allied Governments would then consider whether the Committee should be maintained or withdrawn.The signing of the Treaty of Locarno in October 1925 and the subsequent evacuation of the Cologne zone necessitated consequently a consideration of the future of the Committee of Guarantee and the Nine Rules.This problem was one of considerable difficulty, but a solution was fortunately found in the suggestion first put forward by Dr. Nord of the German Foreign Office. His proposals provided for the abolition of the Nine Rules and of the Committee of Guarantee, coupled with legislative action by Germany herself directed to securing that the requirements of Article 198 should be safeguarded. The legislation outlined would forbid Germany to organise a military or naval air service, would prevent any kind of liaison between civil and military avaition, would prohibit the construction of apparatus for transforming civil into militaiy aircraft, and would prescribe severe penalties for infringements of these prohibitions.The proposal was welcomed by the British Government as a satisfactory solution of the very perplexing question of air control in Germany, and steps were taken to obtain for it a favourable reception by the French Government also. This was readily secured in principle, and, after considerable discussion as to the details of the nature and form of the desired German legislation, a Protocol of Agreement upon the whole subject was finally initialled in Paris on the 7th May, 1926, by the delegates of Great Britain, France, Italy, Belgium, Japan and Germany, and the Agreement itself was signed on the 22nd May, 1926.The Agreement provides that the German Government shall put into operation the measures of control specified in documents annexed to the Agreement and consisting of certain Ordinances to be issued and certain undertakings given by the German Government. Summarised, these documents provide for the definite legislative prohibition by Germany (1) of the construction or importation of aircraft armoured or protected in any way or arranged to take any armament fitting; (2) of pilotless aircraft; (3) of aircraft possessing the characteristics of modem fighter aircraft (as regards weight, ratio of weight to power, &amp;c), without a permit from the Reich Ministry of Communications, and of the flying of such aircraft except by pilots holding a special permit from the same Ministry (as to the granting of permits, see further below); (4) of instruction and training in pilotage of a military character or for a military purpose.
Air Staff, June 9, 1926.The permits which the Reich Minister of Communications can grant for aircraft of the fighter type are limited, by an undertaking given by the German Government, to aircraft taking part in international races or public competitions or in officially controlled records. The number of aeroplanes of this kind must be kept within the limits of the number of civil aeroplanes of the same kind used in another European country for the same purpose ; and the number of pilots authorised to pilot such aircraft must be similarly limited.There is also legislative provision for the declaration to the Reich Ministry of Communications of factories constructing aeronautical material, for the registration of aircraft and aero-engines in process of construction or finished, and of pupils under training, and for the declaration of particulars of associations, companies or individuals engaging in aviation or utilising-or owning aircraft. An undertaking is given by the German Government and also by the German States individually not to grant subsidies to organisations, companies or individuals engaging in aviation, other than to the personnel operating regular commercial air lines or necessary to the normal require-ments of factories; and the German Government undertakes to take suitable measures to prevent municipal authorities from granting subsidies of the kind forbidden.The German Government further undertakes to take measures to prohibit all instruction and training in aviation of a military character or purpose, and to ensure that no public department or its personnel, entrusted with the organisation or admini-stration of an armed force, shall maintain any kind of connection with aviation.The German Government also undertakes to prohibit members of the Reichswehr and the Navy from training for or engaging in flying work, but an exception is allowed in favour of a limited number of members of these services who wish, in their private capacity, to engage in sports flying at their own expense. No subsidies nor special leave can be granted to them for this purpose. The total number to be permitted to fly must not exceed thirty-six, which maximum is to be reached gradually during the six years from the 1st January, 1926, and after that date the permits must be limited to three per annum. Replacements of holders of permits who die or retire from the services are allowed. In addition to the gradually attained maximum of thirty-six pilots above mentioned, a maximum of thirty-six members of the Reichswehr and Navy holding pilots&apos; certificates before the 1st April, 1926, may act as pilots, but their places will not be filled, and they will be shown in a separate list from the first thirty-six.In addition, fifty members of the police are allowed to train for and hold pilots&apos; certificates, solely in order to enable them to exercise an expert control of commercial aviation. Replacements of these fifty pilots&apos; certificates are allowed only if the holder is struck off the police list or reaches the age of 48. No special police aircraft may be kept.Another annexure to the Protocol notifies the Allied Governments&apos; decision to abrogate the prohibition of flight by German aircraft over the occupied territories. German sovereignty over the air of those territories is in future subject only to the right of the Rhineland High Commission, for the purpose of ensuring the safety and meeting the requirements of the armies of occupation, to require any aircraft flying therein to be provided with a visa or permit from the Commission.Another annexure signifies the Allies&apos; agreement to the establishment by Germany in the demilitarised zone of four air ports ^Cologne, Frankfurt, and two others, in north and south) and twelve landing grounds. The four air ports and twelve landing grounds are to be used by commercial or sports aircraft, irrespective of nationality.Another enclosure notifies that the Allies have decided to surrender in favour of the German Government their ownership rights to the Friedrichshafen installations and to the aeronautical installations left in Germany for the requirements of international air traffic.The German Government undertakes to take the necessary measures to put in force the regulations contained in the annexures to the Protocol, and when this has been done the Committee of Guarantee is to be withdrawn. Thenceforth, and without waiting for Germany&apos;s entry into the League of Nations, the provisions of Article 213 of the Treaty of Versailles (under which Germany undertakes to give facilities for investigations considered necessary by the Council of the League) are to apply to the pledges given by Germany.The Air Ministry has been in continuous touch with the course of the negotiations leading up to the final agreement and has concurred in the terms of the settlement.
