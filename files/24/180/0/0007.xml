DOGVmm IS THE PROPERTY Off HIS BRITAHfflC kAJESTY&apos;S GOYEHSMBIKT,)&quot;\ /?\C BH. Copy N0.   kJLJ&quot;&quot;*&quot;&quot;&quot; GAB I 31 E I;;IJDUSTRIAL POLICY.Memorandum &quot;by the Lord Privy, Seal.It is net too soon to call attention to the urgent necessity of a new industrial policy,    It is to &quot;be hoped that within a brief period the present storm of industrial unrest mil have passed by;    that some acceptable arrangement will have been found for the relations between Coal Owners and Miners; and that an Act further regulating Trade Unions and making the illegality and defeat of General Strikes more certain may be passed^     But this will provide no remedy for the underlying industrial ill-health which stretches far beyond the coal trade or the present emergency.      The symptoms, with periodic crises of increasing violence, will continue. Moreover the present Parliament has already run a third of its. course.      If we are to do any good in this Parliament it is high, time our system of treatment began - provided we have not already waited too long.Where shall we look for a remedy?     It is suggested that the causes of unrest such as have led to the recent explosion in so far as they are not controlled by restrictive legislation can be effectually dealt with by material reconstruction.     Reconstruction no doubt is required in many directions but the causes lie deeper than can be conjured by better plants or better markets,,    I am convinced that the root of the matter is in the status of the worker and if the position is not to grow worse it is to the status that the remedy must be applied, In fact there is nc hope, whether we look at the past, the present or the future, that
in this respect the existing system can continue..I-will not dwell upon the familiar history of industrial suspicion,  and its disastrous effect.. It has been partly due to faults of employers -want of fairness, want of sympathy, want of human feeling. - partly to faults of the working-class - envy, discontent and materialism:    partly to the inevitable consequence of education and of the general atmosphere of unrest in the times in which we liveo      But whatever the historical reasons of it the suspicion is not only widespread, but has gradually grown in power,  if not in intensity, and has now  developed into a settled determination to have a change^      And this determination to secure a change has since the War assumed a dangerous and     , therefore an urgent character.      Up to that date the workers sought their ends in Parliament.,      They sought them indeed by means of agitation, sometimes constitutional and sometimes unconstitutional, but until the war it was always directed to an alteration of  the law and to pressure on the Government or. Parliament with this objects      It is however clear that they are beginning to lose faith in that road to relief.      The favourite method now Is direct action, which ^Ls,  in its logical development, revolution.!,      The present situation may therefore properly be termed urgenta     Unless Government and Parliament bestir themselves the change of method may become stereotyped j    revolution may become a conviction.,      The worst of it is that unconstitutional pressure and direct action have been proved2c
to be effective and  the present triumph of the foroes of order is an exception.    The lesson of Irish violence in the achievement of self-government has not been lost.The moral of the successful suffragette agitation cannot be forgotten.    But it is not necessary to look so far afield.    Almost every decade has been marked by Trades Union victories either over Parliament or over their employers by unscrupulous political leverage, by concerted breach of contract,  or even by intimidation and violence.    Thus not only are the workers determined on a change but they know - or they think they know -how they can obtain it.    If then we look at the attitude of the workers and at their intentions -- no doubt largely subconscious, but none the less formidable for that reason - the situation is essentially unstable.But from the standpoint of the employers the position is hardly more favourable.    Their industrial position is fatally insecure.    It is clear that the machinery which governs their relations with their men cannot be trusted.    These are at best a state of armed truce maintained under the protection of contracts and agreements which when they are most required are shamelessly ignored.    Parliament itself has intensified the condition by taking its share in the fraud and either through indolence or cowardice has under the name peaceful picketing recognised a system of intimidation which is the chronic sanction of habitual breaches of faith.Can this condition possibly continue ?   Unless I have entirely misread the character of the British
people the answer will surely be in the negative. They are too practical to tolerate such a state of things.    But really there can be no doubt as to the snswer,    Unless we can do something, effective now it is certain that the irritation will burst out again,  the sore will onoe more and repeatedly become acute.    We shall be driven to disastrous concessions or we shall be replaced by a Labour Government within a few years,  and the Labour Govern-ment,  in deference to tho imperious discontent of the country if not to their own convictions will of course enter upon experiments in industrial nationalisation which it ia our main object to prevent.    Eo doubt nationalisation is a mistake;    no doubt it will not even give the worker that Improvement in status to which he aspires;    but it can be plausibly represented as helping him in this respectv and status is the sore point.    He is no longer content to be merely a hired machine of sombody else&apos;s to do somebody else&apos;s work for so much an hour or so much a week and to hare no more to do with it.    And he will be told, and will partly believe it,  that if the means of production are nationalised,  tho work will be the Nation&apos;s   work and  therefore,  as he is part of the Nation, his own work.    It.is the sense of ownership -the most powerful in human nature next to the sense of life itself - that will be appealed to,  and the only effectual way of countering the attraction of Nationalisation as a remedy for industrial unrest is by an appeal to  the same motive.      I know of no method applicable to our modern industrial
system which fulfils this &quot;condition except Co-partnership Profit-sharing even if it could be generally applied is not sufficient.      As a matter of fact there are many industries in which the profits in relation to the wages bill are sc small as to make the application of profit-sharing insignificant.      But even where it can be applied it is only another form of payment for work the results of which are not the worker1s own but somebody elsefs. It doss indeed give the workman some interest in the success of the industry and to that extent is an improvement on the ordinary system,  but it does not possess the magic of property.      What is essential Is to give him axithority,  to raise the status of the worker from being that of a machine into being that of an owner, Then indeed we shall have met Hat i on alis at i on upon the ground of Its own appeal and nevertheless shall have done so rigidly within the principle of private enter-pri s e .The time then is ripe to proceed upon these lines. Go-partnership was part of our aims at the General Election though we have done nothing as yet to further it What should be the first step?     For example, how far can it be made a condition of a Limited Company?     After all Company Law gives great privileges to Limited. Companies.      The owners of them - the shareholders -have their liability artificially protected.      I see no reason why in fairness they might not be  required In return for these privileges to accept a measure of Co-partnership.      But I am not sure whether public opinion is yet ripe for so direct a method.      Again It has been suggested that some advantage in taxation should be given to Companies and businesses who adopt

But I am not sure whether public opinion is yet ripe for so direct a method.     Again it has been suggested that some advantage In taxation should be given to Companies and businesses who adopt
Co-partnership:      That is worth consideration.      But the application of the system, requires much more thought than I have given it or am capable of giving it. At any rate one step could he taken which is not to be despised.      It might be made a condition of Government contracts that a preference -will  always be given to Companies and firms which have adopted. Co-partnership. I say it is not to be despised because we know from experience that to give the imprimatur of the State to any system, especially at a time when public opinion is deeply stirred upon the subject to which it applies, has a profound influence.One observation may be added.      If it be contended, that the admission of representatives of the  workers as part owners to control the business would hamper it and reduce profits,  it can be answered that nothing can be such a handicap as the present system of imcertainty varied by explosions.      Nothing could be so burdensome as that.      But I need not say that so far from admitting that Co-partnership would be a handicap I believe It would stimulate production apart altogether from its effect upon Industrial unrest.In conclusion I respectfully sxjggest that no more time should be lost in setting on foot a Committee which should thoroughly Investigate the possibilities of Co-partnership as applied to industry.S.
