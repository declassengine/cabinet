SECRET. CoPy No*   ^O.P. 257 A (26).CABINET.COMPULSORY ARBITRATION.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India.PAPER (D) annexed to the Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in regard to Compulsory Arbitration (Paper CP. 257 (26)) records certain recent views expressed by Dominion Governments on this subject. It seems desirable that I should place on record also the views expressed by the Government of India on this subject in September 1924 in connection with the discussion at the Vth Assembly of the League of Nations of the Protocol for the Pacific Settlement of International Disputes.The Government of India then informed the Secretary of State for India that, while desirous not to place obstacles in the way of provision of further procedure which would permit of the adjustment of differences between States and thus perhaps avoid future war, they were impressed by the need for caution and would prefer to wait till they had had several years&apos; experience of the working of the Permanent Court of International Justice before deciding to accept clause 36 of the Statutes of the Court, as proposed in the Protocol for Pacific Settlement, either conditionally or otherwise. In any case they could not agree to acts of the past being submitted to the jurisdiction of the Court. Moreover, they thought they would also have to exclude from its&apos; purview cases in which the vital interests, independence or honour of India were concerned. They added that, whereas His Majesty&apos;s Government were at the time chiefly concerned to exclude from the jurisdiction of the Court disputes arising out of British belligerent naval action, they, on the other hand, had to consider their long belt of frontier marching with that of China, which country had already ratified the Protocol of the Permanent Court, including clause 36. They considered that it would be very difficult, if not impossible, to enforce on China the execution of any decree of the Court and for this reason would be unwilling to be cited by China before it. China, for instance, claims suzerainty over Tibet, though unable to exercise it, and might thus be able to prejudice the relations of the Government of India with Tibet.BIRKENHEAD.India Office, July 7, 1926.[u811][This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.
