I wish to call the attention of my colleagues to certain questions, which arise under     110 the Official Secrets Act, in connection  with the  supply to foreign governments of  General munitions of war or of information relating thereto. 39152. Paragraph (1a), which was introduced into Section 2 of the Official Secrets Act, 1911, by Section 9 of the Official Secrets Act, 1920, runs as follows : &apos;&quot; If any person having in his possession or control any sketch, plan, model, article, note, document or information which relates to munitions of war,* communi-cates it directly or indirectly to any foreign Power, or in any other manner prejudicial to the safety or interests of the State, that person shall be guilty of a misdemeanour.&quot;This paragraph was inserted in the Act to implement a resolution, formulated by the Admiralty, War Office, Air Ministry and Ministry of Munitions in conference in 1919. to the effect that it should be made illegal for any person to communicate informa-tion in any form concerning munitions without the permission of the appropriate Government Department. The intention was, no doubt, to prevent manufacturers and others using, in their business with foreign countries, and otherwise, information which they had acquired during the war about munitions, and which it was desired to keep secret. It now appears, however, that the paragraph as drafted not only had this effect, but also made it illegal for the Government to permit the export of munitions or the communication of any information relating to them, even when from the point of view of official secrecy such export or communication was unobjectionable, since the Law Officers have ruled that the effect of the section of the Official Secrets Act, quoted above, is to make it a misdemeanour to communicate to a foreign Power any munitions, or information relating thereto, notwithstanding that it is not prejudicial to the interests of the State. , A Government Department cannot give a licence to do that which under the Act is a breach of the law.3. For the time being, as some way out of the difficulty created by the absolute terms of Section 2 (1a) of the 1911 Act has had to be found, persons who apply to export munitions, to file applications for patents, &amp;c, in cases where it is not prejudicial to the safety or interests of the State, are told (in a form approved by the Attorney-General), that, in view of the terms of the Official Secrets Act, the Army Council are not in a position to grant authority to supply information relating to munitions to a foreign Power, but the consent of the Attorney-General would be required for a prosecution under Section 8 of the Official Secrets Act, 1911, and in the particular case it is not proposed to move him to institute proceedings.4. The Law Officers are of opinion, however, that it is not satisfactory to make use of the Attorney-General&apos;s discretion in this way, deliberately, as part of a system of licencing, and, in order to carry out the principle decided upon by the Service departments in 1919, suggested that there should be an amendment of the Act giving power to a government department to issue licences, and providing that the export of articles under such a licence should not constitute a breach of the Official Secrets Act.5. The three Service departments have discussed the situation but they are not agreed as to the direction in which the Act should be amended. The Admiralty and the Air Ministry are in favour of abandoning the idea of instituting a system of licencing ; they would amend the Act so as to provide that the communication to a foreign Power of any information relating to munitions shall be an offence if, and only if, it is prejudicial to the safety or interests of the State, i.e., they would leave it to the individual to make theThe Law Officers have advised that the expression &quot; sketch, plan, model, article, note, document or information which relates to munitions of war &quot; includes an actual munition of war.(b26/17)   100   5/26   w.o.p.   2584
communication at his own risk, relying on the understanding which has been established with the principal manufacturers that they would consult us before undertaking foreign orders, supplemented by the powers which already exist, whether under statute or otherwise, to prevent the export of munitions in material form. The Admiralty and the Air Ministry would add to these powers a control over new inventions by amending the Patents Act so as to secure that the Service departments have the opportunity of inspecting applications for patents relating to munitions before the specifications are published.Both the Admiralty and the Air Ministry are concerned at the amount of investiga-tion which they consider that a system of licencing would involve , they say it would hamper trade, as it would not allow manufacturing firms to come to any general agreement with the Service departments as to the class of information which they may &quot; communicate.&quot; Information about munitions of war, including actual plans and modifications thereof, which the firm wishes to send to a foreign country, would have to be licensed ad hoc, involving detailed examination by the Service department and consequent great delay of the firm&apos;s negotiations. In the case of some munitions the procedure would be impracticable ; e.g., although the licensing of complete aircraft and aero engines might be carried out, such licensing would be incomplete unless component parts were included ; and, as an aircraft with its engine may embrace as many as 10,000 component parts, the investigation involved in a complete system of licensing would be impracticable.6. The War Office have taken the view that it would be a mistake to weaken the powers of control which have been secured by the Act, and that the question whether a communication relating to munitions can safely be made to a foreign power should not be left as a matter of opinion for individuals to decide. The Act is not concerned here with the purpose of the persons making the communication, but with the effect of their communication on the interests of the State, and this is not a matter which they can decide for themselves. In fact, a system of licencing, though necessarily of a rather cumbrous kind, is already in force, and there is no guarantee that the departments will be consulted to the same extent as at present if the existing prohibition on export and communication be removed. There seems to be no particular reason why the substitution for the existing provisional arrangement of a legalized licencing system should involve more work or raise any new problems.The procedure, however, requires to be systematized to ensure that applications are considered in the right quarter, and it would be preferable that the Act should prescribe a central authority empowered to give the licence on behalf of the several departments. The Treasury Solicitor suggested that this central authority should be the Board of Trade, but I understand that the Board are unwilling to accept responsibility, especially in Parliament, for matters outside their competence, even though it were understood that they were acting on the decision of the proper department.This question of the central authority will require further consideration if the War Office view is accepted.7. I ask, therefore, for a decision on the question of policy, viz., whether : (1) The War Office view is to be adopted, and the Act amended to provide that no person who has obtained a licence from the proper authority, shall be deemed to have committed a breach of the Official Secrets Act, by reason of his having communicated to a foreign power information relating to the munition of war covered by the licence : this involves setting up a licensing authority, and it will be for decision whether this shall be the Board of Trade or what other arrangement is to be made ;(2) The Act is to be amended, as proposed by the Admiralty and the Air Ministry, to make it an offence to communicate information relating to munitions to u foreign power, only if it is prejudicial to the safety and interests of the State, relying, as the Admiralty &apos; and Air Ministry believe they can rely, on their close relations with the industries in which they are interested to ensure that it is understood what will be regarded as &quot;prejudicial &quot; under the Act.(3) The Act is to be left as it is.This last alternative, involves the continued use of the Attorney-G-eneraFs discretion in. a. way which the Law Officers consider to be unsatisfactory.L. W.-E.The Wai* Office,14th May, 1926.
