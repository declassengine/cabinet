COW MQ* .P.271/26.CAB int SqPINd O? SCHOOL^ CHILDRSIT * MfflPRAMDOtt by the 1RS3IH3HT of tfre BOAHD Off SDtJCAfflON*I circulate the annexed Memorandum on the feeding of school children in order that qy colleagues my he informed of the position.   While Local Authorities generally are, I think, acting wisely and efficiently I have very little doubt that in some areas, and notably in Durham, more is being spent on this service than is necessary.   The-comparison made in the annexed Memorandum between Durham and Glamorgan indicates this fairly clearly.   On the other hand, a special inspection which has been made of school feeding in Durham has not yielded any evidence of actual irregularity. We are already exercising all the control over the Durham County Council and other Local Authorities that is possible by ordinary methods of inspection.   General laxity of administration in matters of relief can only be effectively dealt with by some form of rationing, and my own view is that any attempt in this direction at the present moment would do more harm than good.   Hitherto, however, the main brunt, of enforcing a proper standard of relief in connection with the strike has fallen upon the Ministry of Health and X think it is right that I should give my colleagues an opportunity of considering whether further action by the Board of Education i3 desirable.15th July, 1926.

The coal stoppage in 1923. lasted for 3 months, Beginning on 1st April and ending on 1st July.   The number of children fed &quot;by LocaXESduoatdon-Authorities rose from 82,000 in the first week, 107,000 in the second, 169,000 in the 3rd and 278,000 in the fourth to a maximum of 432,000 in the last week but one of the stoppage. Similarly the number of meals provided rose from 422,000 in the first week to a maximum of 3,474,000 in the eleventh weeko   The number of Local Authorities feeding at the beginning of the stoppage was 125 out of 318;   at the end it was 169t   The average cost of a meal was roughly 4d* The 3,000.000 at&amp;als mark wae reached, in the sixth week and from then onwards the cost was  60,000. rising to nearly  60,000 per week.2-     The present stoppage began on the     let May and has now lasted nearly 11 weeks *   Returns which are summarized on the attached Schedule are available up to and including the ninth week.   The number of children receiving school meals in the weak before the stoppage was 54,000-    In the first week of tha stoppage it was 55,000, in the second week 88,000*   The numbers rose in the third week to 216*000, the great increase on this occasion coming between the second and third weeks as compared with the third and fourth weeks In 1921, doubtless as the result of the
General Strike.   The fourth week was Whit week and as in 1921 showed a reduction.   The numbers thereafter have risen steadily by increases of about 8,000 per week to 261,000 in the ninth week.   The number of meals provided which was 291,000 in the week before the stoppage and 300,000 in the first week, has risen to 2,360,000 in the ninth week.     The average number of meals provided per child per week which was 5*4 at the beginning has risen steadily to 9*   The number of Authorities feeding has increased from 118 to 156 covering all the mining areas with very few exceptions.    The approximate weekly expenditure which was  4,254 before the stoppage is now  30,819, the average cost per meal being about 3d.3,     Comparing the position in the ninth week of the present stoppage with the position in the ninth week of the 1921 dispute 261,000 children are being fed now compared with 412,000 then and   2,360,000 meals are being provided now compared with 3,392,000 then.   The present figures are about two-thirds of the 1921 figures.   The number of Authorities feeding now is 12 less than the number in 1921.   The cost for the ninth week in 1921 was about  56,000;    it is now roughly  31,000.4.     These figures speak for themselves and confirm the information received in reports that Authorities generally are profiting by the experience they obtained In 1921 and exercising much more care and restraint than they then did.   More also is &quot;being done on the present occasion by voluntary effort and organisation, notably in the West Riding.position in Durham.,. 5.     In 1921 Durham County were the largest feeding Authority, the numbers rising to a maximum of about
75,000 chd-ldren f ed and 815VO00 meals provided in a week. The percentage of children fed to the total number of children in the schools was 60.   The total expenditure incurred by the Authority in the year 1921-22 was  150,000, approximately one-sixth of the total expenditure for England and \7ales as a whole.6.     The number of children fed in Durham in the ninth week of the present stoppage is roughly 65,000 and the number of meals provided roughly 700*000*    In both cases the figures are considerably less than in 1921, the percentage of children fed to the total number of children being, on this occasion,, 50*3.    Compared with the country as a whole Durham, which in 1921 fed 13.6 per cent of the total, are now feeding 24.6 per cent.    It is clear however that the explanation is not that Durham are doing more -they are in fact doing less - but that the rest of the country is doing considerably le3S than in 1921.7.     In reviewing the position in Durham, Glamorgan may be taken as a County most nearly resembling Durham for purposes of comparison.   While the total population of Glamorgan is somewhat less than that of Durham the number of miners in the two Counties is just about the same.   The number of school children in Durham County Education Area, however,  is double that of Glamorgan.   Glamorgan in 1921 fed 35 per cent of the total number of children compared with Durham&apos;s 60 per cent.    They are now feeding 27 per cent compared with Durham1s 50 per cent, the figures in each case being lower but about the same proportion to one another. Similarly compared with the country as a whole Glamorgan, which fed in 1921 3.9 per cent of the total of the country, are now feeding 6.6 per cent, nearly dotible the 1921 percentage but actually a smaller number absolutely and a smaller percentage of the total number of Glamorgan children.
8.     It ia impossible to give any exact explanation of the difference in the proportion of children being fed in the two Counties.   In 1921 Glamorgan insisted on the parents undertaking to repay the cost of the meals after the stoppage.   They continued to collect these repayments for two or three years and in the aggregate obtained a considerable sum.   On the present occasion they are not requiring such an undertaking but the 1921 experience has probably had a certain deterrent effect on the parents. Durham is a County on which the present crisis iB likely to bear with special stress.    It specialises in the heavy industries, coal mining, iron and steel and shipbuilding. Coal mining is entirely closed down, iron and eteel practically closed down and shipbuilding very seriously affected. The conditions in Glamorgan are probably not quite so bad.9.     In both Counties practically all the Boards of Guardians are now making deductions from the relief granted to families in respect of children fed by the Education Authority though the amount deducted in many cases in Durham is on the low side.   In Durham none of the Boards of Guardians and in Glamorgan only one or two have, however, undertaken to repay the Education Authority.
