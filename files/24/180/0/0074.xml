(ETI3 DOCUMENT IS THE PiiOP.iiii.iTY OF HIS BHITANKIC majesty is GOViSSISKMT)Memorandum by. ;the.j. ffia&amp;noial Seoretary of the Treasury.This is an annual Bill confirming the Customs Resolutions of the Manx legislature and requires very little explanation.    The Isle of Man has a separate financial existence, levying Its own taxes and defraying its own expenditure, and in particular,  it is completely free as to Customs and -Excise duties, subject to con-firmation by the Imperial Parliament.    It would be unprecedented for Parliament to alter them.The effeot of the Resolutions confirmed by this Bill is substantially to impose tho same Customs tariff as In this country.    The. duties on Beer and Spirits remain, as at present, slightly below   ImporLal rates; there are no Island current^i&apos;es on sugar,   table waters, dried fruits, and wrapping pap^r:    the duties on all other articles . are at Imperial rates as modified by our own Finance Bill of this year.The Bill, whioh occupies very little Parliamentary time,  is required this Session.    Authority is accordingly requested to introduce the Bill forthwith.CP. 273 (26)&apos;.S E C R a cabinet.ISLE 01&apos;&apos; MAN  (CUSTOMS) BILL 19E6.R. MoN.Treasury Chambers,17th July,  1926.
