POCUKENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRIIASUIG MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT.SCR E.T. Copy No.^*3&apos; &apos; G A B 1JS E T.p.  209 (26 ) .LASS BEQUEST COMMTTSE . REPORT.1.        At their Meeting on April 21st ,  1926 (Cabinet 18(26) Conclusion 5&quot;) the Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs in regard to the late Sir Hugh lane&apos;s bequest of thirty-nine pictures to the national Gallery London (CP.  l^A (26)) and agreed that a Committee composed of  :-The Lord Chancellor,The Chancellor sf the Exchequer,The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs,The Secretary of State for India,The Eirst Commissioner of Works,The Attorney-General, should examine the question and report to the Cabinet.20       The Committee have carefully considered the various documents circulated in 1919 *0 the Coalition Government when after detailed exajsinat ion that Government decided &quot;that it was \mdesirable to take any steps by Act of &quot;Parliament to depart from the intention, expressed in &quot;the will of Sir Hugh Lane to leave his collection of &quot;Continental Pictures to the National Gallery in London.&quot; (Cabinet 8 (19) Appendix v (2).)      The Committee have also examined the Report dated January 28th,  1925,  of the Committee under the Chairmanship of Mr, J, V/. Vfilson, M.P.
which was appointed by the late Government to enquire into-certain questions relating to the Lane Bequest and the considerations contained in Memoranda CP. 203  (25) and C.P.  154- (26) recently circulated to the Cabinet by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs and they have conferred with the Earl of Crawford and Balcarres, and other Trustees of the National Gallery.3.       The Committee are of opinion that no steps should be taken^ by legislation or otherwise,  to compel the Trustees cf the National Gallery to transfer the pictures comprised in the Lane Bequest to Dublin or to coerce the Trustees into the acceptance of some arrangement of which they disapprove.      The Committee^ reasons for this view may be sirmma-rised as f ollows: -(l)     The legal ownership of the pictures isunquestionably vested in the Trustees of the National Gallery,  and t^ depi-ivs those Trustees of their legac;/, by legislation, would create en undesirable precedent and might excite misgivings in the minds of intending donors, (2)      Sir Hugh Lane&apos;s intentions as to the ultimate destination of the pictures appear to have varied from time to time,  and from statements made by him in two interviews after the date of the unwitnessed codicil it would seem that he had   then come to no final decision. (3)     Dublin is in possession of the bulk pfSir Hugh LaneTs collections;    the 39 pictures bequeathed to the National Gallery represent a fraction of the benefactions r.s..de by Sir Hugh Lane to Dublin in his lifetime and by his will.
(4)    Leoisi ons against compulsory&apos; transfer by legislation were taken by the Coalition Government in 1919 after full Ministerial consideration (H.&amp;.C,  43rd Meeting,  24 October, 1919 and Confersnce of Ministers of 17 November, 1919).    The Wilson Committee also report against the adoption of such a course.(5)    Sir Joseph Duveen&apos;s gift to  the Nation of a Gallery for modern Continental Pictures was made on the--assumption (which was fully justified by the decisions which had then been taken) that the 39 Lane pictures would remain in London and would form the nucleus ef the Collection; and other pictures,  chosen to fit in with-the Lane Bequest,  have since been acquired for the Gallery.(.6!    It is open to the Trustees of the -national gallery under section 4 of the National Gallery (Loan) Act of 1863 to lend the pictures to Lublin after 15 years from the date when the pictures came into the possession of the Trustees  (i.e.  in or about 1930). 4.      V/hile the Committee are wholly opposed to any idea ofcoercing the Trustees of the National Gallery,  they thought it desirable to confer with the Trustees with a view to seeing whether an arrangement could be made, under which a substantial number of pictures in the Lane Bequest should be exhibited in Lublin on loan from the National Gallery. 4 settlement on this basis would go far to meet the case of those who maintain that but for a legal accident the pictures would have found a permanent home in Lublin, and
would remove a source of grievance which at the moment threatens to disturb tho good relations of this country and the Irish Free State.5.      The Trustees of the Rational Gallery have informed the Committee that their present intention is to lend to Dublin on the expiration of 15 years from the date when the pictures came Into the possession of the National Gallery a substantial number of their lane pictures from time to time, and far substantial periods-    They will not insist as a condition precedent to the loan that a special Gallery should be provided in Dublin to accommodate the pictures (as required by the terms of the Testa torTs will). G.      The Committee are satisfied that this statement by the Trustees is in all the circumstances a reasonable and fair one.    They think however that the  settlement of this vexed question might be facilitated if (as reoommended by the Wilson Committee) section 4 of the National Gallery (D^an) Act of 18S3 were amended so as to enable the Trustees to lend works from the leane Bequest to Dublin befnre the expiration of the 15 years period named in that section..    The British Government should only undertake to introduce such legislation on the understanding that it will be acoeptod as a final settlement of  the contra-versy, and  the amending legislation would in any case be definitely limited  tr the Pictures in the lane Bequest and should not in any way affect  the existing powers of the Trustees as regards other gigts and bequests past or future,.    While the Trustees fear that amending legislation, even sf this limited nature, may have prejudicial effects as regards intending donors and may constitute an embarrassing precedent,  it seems improbable that they would seriously oppose its passage into law.
7.      The Trustees have expressed  to the Committee their great anxiety that a definite decision on the question may he reached without delay, and in particular that it may be found possible for His Majesty The King to indicate a date this summer for the opening of the new Duveen Gallery by His Majesty, a ceremony which has been postponed pending a final decision on the Lane Bequest.The Committee submit the following rooommendations to the Cabinet:-(l)    That on receipt of an answer from the IrishGovernment to the communication In (II) below the Report of the Wilson Committee: should be published and that an announcement should simultaneously be made that the Government accept the conclusion reached by that Committee that it would be improper to modify Sir Hugh LaneTs will by legislation. (II)    That the Secretary of State for Lominion Affairs should be authorised to inform the President ef the -Executive Council **f the Irish Free State forthwith of the deoision in. (I) above, and at the same time to state that the BritishGovernment have received an assurance from the Trustees of the National Gallery that it is their present Intention to lend to Dublin on the expiration of 15 years from the date when the pictures came into their possession a substantial number of their Lane pictures from time to time and for a substantial period whether a special Gallery has then been provided in Lublin for the pictures&apos; or not.
(ill)    That Mr. Cosgrave should also he informedthat if the Government of the Irish free Stats will aocept the above arrangement as a final settlement of the Question the British Government will be prepared to introduce and to carry into- lew a Bill amending oec cion 4 of the National Gallery (Loan) Act, 1883, so as to enable the Trustees of the National Gallery to lend Lane Bequest pictures to Dublin immediately after the passage of the Bill into lnw* (IT)    That the proposed legislation should only be introduced if Mr.  Cosgrave&apos;s answer is in the affirmative and he should be Invited to reply -lS soon as possible (V)    That the Prime Minister should be requestedto ascertain His Majesty&apos;s pleasure respecting the postponed opening of the New Duveen Gallery.Signed on behalf of the CommitteeCAVECha chairman.S Whitehall Gardens, 20th May,   1926.Note     As a matter of urgency this Report is being submitted to the Prime Minister with a view to the Secretary of Stato for Dominion Affairs being authorised,  in anticipation of Cabinet sanction, to take action on the lines indicated in paragraphs  (II) and  (III).
