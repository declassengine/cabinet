In the unavoidable absence of the Prime Minister, Lord Balfour took the Chair.(1.) REDUCTION AND LIMITATION OF ARMAMENTS. (Previous Reference :  OLD. Minutes of 212th Meeting, Minute 1.)French Proposals regarding the Definition of Guarantees under Article 16of the Covenant.(OLD. Papers Nos. 690-B and 693-B.)THE COMMITTEE had under consideration a letter from the Foreign Office ^ covering telegrams from Lord Cecil on French proposals regarding the definition of guarantees under Article 16 of the Covenant which had been put forward at the Meeting of the Preparatory Commission at Geneva. (OLD. Papers Nos. 690-B and 693-B, the latter circulated shortly before the meeting.)LORD BALFOUR stated that the object of the Meeting was to advise the Cabinet as to the instructions which should be given to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in regard to the French proposals which had been referred to the Council of the League of Nations for consideration at its next meeting fixed for the 7th June. He asked Lord Cecil, who had recently returned from the Meeting of the Preparatory Commission at Geneva, to explain the situation as left by the discussions of the Preparatory Commission.LORD CECIL stated that the Preparatory Commission was not actually an organ of the League of Nations, but was a Body which had been called into being by the League, and included representatives of certain States which were not members of the League.In regard to the question of the Reduction and Limitation of Armaments, the attitude of the United States of America was vital. The United States Delegation totalled no less than nineteen, under the leadership of Mr. Gibson, and, so far as he had been able to judge, was actuated by very sincere intentions in regard to the whole question of disarmament. Mr. Gibson had informed him that the United States Congress.was practically unanimous in support of the present attempt to bring about a reduction of armaments, and the American Senate also was in favour of this proposal, even to the extent of including the support of Senator Borah. At the same time the American Delegation seemed to be inspired by a feeling that the League of Nations itself was a dangerous body, and that great care should be exercised in not identifying themselves with any of its organisations. For this reason it had been necessary for two sub-committees to be set up for the examination of the proposals for disarmament, which consisted of the identical persons who served on the corresponding organisations of the League, but to which different titles had to be given to meet American susceptibilities.The French attitude towards disarmament was much the same as that which they usually adopted. He thought,-however, that it was true to say that as a result of the various forces, mainly financial, at work in Paris, the French were really desirous of making a serious attempt towards disarmament. The desire to reduce their armaments for financial reasons, and the fear that they might thereby expose themselves to German revenge, had the result of making French policy on the subject somewhat incoherent.The Italians appeared to be definitely against all constructive measures of disarmament if these measures could in any way be avoided.The smaller countries were very strongly in favour of disarmament, but almost all were inspired by the necessity of ensuring security first as a prerequisite of disarmament afterwards.The Germans, under the leadership of Baron Bernstorff, had adopted a very correct attitude. They never hinted that the German Forces should, in fact, be increased in order to arrive at a measure of greater equality with their nearest neighbours, but they had been careful to point out that Germany had been, in fact, disarmed, and that this disarmament had been accompanied by definite pledges that other countries would also reduce their armaments.The Japanese practically took little part in the discussions. They had, however, in the course of the discussions, exploded a curious cracker in saying at Tokio that they were ready to resume negotiations in regard to naval disarmament at Washington.
Mr. Gibson, the American representative, had immediately approached him and had pointed out that the American Delegation had nothing whatever to do with this proposal on the part of the Japanese. He had suggested that the question of naval disarmament should be the subject of discussion between the Naval Representatives of the American and British Delegations and, in accordance with authority which had been received by telegram from England, those discussions were now going on.SIR AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN intervened to remark that the Japanese suggestion was curious in that in the past, when proposals had been made by Great Britain that naval disarmament should be separated from military disarmament and should form the subject of a separate conference at Washington, it had been the Japanese who, with the support of the French and Italians, had definitely stated that the whole range of disarmament must be treated together, and not at separate conferences.LORD CECIL explained that it was a representative of the Press Association who, at an interview, had been informed by a Japanese Delegate that the proposal for a separate Conference had definitely been made by the Japanese Government, and he was fully authorised to give this proposal any publicity. After the proposal had been published, the Japanese Delegate repudiated this interview, and stated that he was surprised that a representative of the Press Association should have acted in the manner in which he had.He, Lord Cecil, had adopted the attitude at the Conference that he was not authorised to discuss the French proposals for an increase of security, but only proposals for a reduction of armaments. His attitude in this respect had been profoundly unpopular with all the Delegations present, with the possible exception of the Swedes and the Americans. The opening debates of the Preparatory Commission had been rather unsatisfactory. Every Delegation seemed to be waiting to see what the other Delegations proposed. Later on the general atmosphere had greatly improved. The Qiiestionnaire was examined and certain points were referred to a Drafting Committee charged with deciding what matters were political, what military and&apos; what civilian. Those which were of a military character were referred to what was styled Committee &quot;A&quot; and others of a civilian character to Committee &quot; B.&quot;This Drafting Committee arrived at the conclusion that the scheme for disarmament should only be applied to the Peace strength of any individual State;, and this conclusion led to considerable discussion as to what was meant by &quot; Peace strength.&quot; The French Delegation considered that &quot;Peace strength&quot; signified forces which could be put into the Fighting Line without any measures of mobilisa-tion.. The British and Belgian Delegates considered that the &quot; Peace strength &quot; was that force which could be put into the field without training additional soldiers, i.e., what might be termed forces which were immediately mobilisable. This proposal did not meet with the approval of the French Delegation in any way, and he had been unable to discover for some time what was the cause of their disapproval. Some time later, after an interview with one of the technical advisers of the French Delegation, he gathered that the French Government were contemplating an entirely new organisation, which would consist of (a.) A small highly-organised force for purposes of Home Defence; (b.) A similar small force for service overseas; and(c.) The great bulk of the Land Forces, consisting of half-trained troops who had only been in service for a period of about six months.It appeared that the French Delegation thought that the British Government had learned of this proposed reorganisation, and that their suggestions in regard to a reduction of armaments were really aimed at cutting down the strength of these half-trained troops which constituted the bulk of their Forces. Tie had, of course, explained that no such intention lay in the British proposals, but nevertheless the controversy which had been raised on the subject left a certain amount of soreness behind it. The French Delegation also put forward a document to the effect that when the final stage of the work of the Preparatory Committee was reached, it was the^ duty of each State to produce a scheme showing the measure of disarmament which it was prepared to put into force, and the reasons on which this scheme was based. The French added that they were prepared to put forward such a scheme themselves, and it transpired that their proposals amounted to a reduction both of effectives and of budgetary expenditure.[14627]        &quot; B 2
LORD BALFOUR intervened to enquire whether the French proposal was m effect a reduction in the number of effectives or a reduction in efficiency.LORD CECIL explained that their proposal was first of all a reduction in the number of effectives. They realised also that a reduction of the number of effectives must be accompanied by a limitation of material which they proposed to effect by a limitation of budgetary expenditure. He had got the impression that the French were really desirous of bringing about some scheme of practical disarmament for themselves, and were therefore anxious that disarmament should become of general application. They had, however, explained that whatever they were able to do in the direction of disarmament depended largely on the security which they could obtain under the Covenant and the Locarno Treaty. This reference to security led to an extraordinary controversy. Originally, the French proposals involved an attempt to limit ultimate war strength. He gathered that that was not their proposal now, but that they considered that in determining the actual strength of armaments which would be permitted to any State, the potential ultimate war strength of that State would have to be taken into consideration. He thought that the reason underlying this proposal was the fear that they would not be allowed a sufficiently large margin of superiority over Germany. He had pointed out, how-ever, that since the potential ultimate war strength of a State depended really on the population, of that State, the proposal would in effect result in the smallest country being allowed to maintain the largest army.SIR AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN enquired whether ultimate war strength (potentiei de guerre) did not really mean manufacturing capacity and not numbers of population ?LORD CECIL replied that so far as he understood it meant all the factors included under Question 5 (C.I.D. Paper No. 693-B, p. 1), which was the kernel of the whole problem. In his instructions before going to Geneva he had been told to postpone discussion on this question as far as possible and to avoid entering into any controversial matters until such time as the more simple questions had been cleared out of the way. Prior to his departure to Geneva he had had a conversation with Colonel Requin and had understood that the Colonel was in agreement with this proposal. It transpired, however, that the French attitude had changed by the time the Preparatory Commission had assembled at Geneva and he thought that this change was probably due to the character of the Chief French Delegate, M. Boncourt. Without any warning the French had suddenly produced the proposals set out in the papers which had been circulated to the Committee. At first he had though that the putting forward of these proposals at this. stage might have been deliberately done with the object of breaking up the whole Conference and bringing all attempts at disarmament to nothing, but he had decided, after reflection, that it was really due to M. Boncourts desire to play a dramatic part. Following upon the French proposals, Poland and Finland had also produced plans of much the same kind, asking for special means of security as a condition of limitation of armaments. In the circumstances he considered that the only thing for him to do, having regard to his instructions, was to get the Preparatory Commission to agree that, since the French proposals affected the Covenant itself, it was necessary that they should be referred to the Council, since the Americans could, of course, not participate in any discussion on the subject of the Covenant itself. After the meeting, M. Boncourt came to see him privately and it was agreed to send the French proposals to the Council as from the Preparatory Commission and not as from the French Government. As to how the French proposals should now be dealt with was a difficult problem. His Majesty&apos;s Government could, of course, say that they would have nothing whatever to do with them, but he was doubtful whether this would be the proper course. We had often reiterated in the past that we were bound by article 16 of the Covenant. In these circumstances was it logical to adopt the attitude that we declined to say and even to discuss how article 16 should be put into effect ? If we adopted such an attitude we should find a large number of countries openly opposed to us. The French Delegation was anxious that the Preparatory Commission should accept the French proposals and send them for consideration by the Technical Commissions. In his view to accept this proposal would be dangerous. The Technical Commissions would proceed to draw up a scheme in detail and^he felt convinced that it would be very difficult for this country to accept any scheme thus produced. He had no doubt that the French had an elaborate scheme for putting article 16 into effect something which would enable the French
Government to explain to their people that security was assured and disarmament could now be carried out without any risk. He was convinced that to send the proposals to the Mixed Commission would be particularly hazardous. He thought that the French desire to do this was prompted by internal reasons. On the Mixed Commission there served a French Socialist by the name of M. Jouhaux, who had been greatly interested at all times in disarmament and exercised considerable influence. With the creation of the Preparatory Commission, disarmament had been removed from M. Jouhaux&apos;s spheres of activity. - So long as M. Jouhaux confined himself to making speeches on disarmament, no great harm could result, but he was very doubtful of the wisdom of allowing M. Jouhaux to draw up schemes for implementing article 16 of the Covenant. If, therefore, it was inadvisable either to reject the French proposals completely or to agree to sending them en bloc for consideration by the Technical Commission, what other course remained open ? He suggested that the only method was to accept a certain number of the proposals and toi^eject others.&apos; The proposals as they originally stood would be found at the foot of page 2 of the paper which had been circulated by the Foreign Office (C.I.D. Paper No. 693-B). These proposals had been slightly altered later and the amended version was to be found at the foot of page 5. The alterations amounted in effect to including a reference to the Graeco-Bulgarian dispute and to the elimination of the proposal at 3 (d), viz., &quot;to lay down the rules for keeping at the disposal of such committees up-to-date information regarding the economic deficiencies of different countries and their eventual needs should they be the object of aggression.&quot; He had pointed out that this proposal was quite impossible.Turning to the consideration of the proposals as contained at the foot of page 5, Lord Cecil pointed out that they were put forward, as stated in the preamble, &quot;in order that a State should be able to calculate to what extent it can consent to the reduction or limitation of its armaments, it is essential to determine what method and what machinery are best calculated to give help to that State when attacked.&quot; He continued that, in his view, there was no objection to the proposal at 1 (a), which amounted to facilitating the meeting of the Council at short notice; nor did he think there was any grave objection to 1 (&amp;), although he noticed that, in the Foreign Office Paper, it had been suggested that the object of this proposal was to eliminate the necessity for unanimity. Question 2 (a) was really a political question as to the amount of security which was available under the Covenant and various Treaties. As to Question 2 (b), he was doubtful as to the exact meaning, but he thought that it was intended to cover the establishment of some such body as a General Staff for the League.LORD BEATTY remarked that the English version was not a correct translation of the French text, and suggested that the word &quot; drafting &quot; should really be read to mean &quot;formulation.&quot;LORD CECIL continued that proposal 2 (c) was a purely political one, proposal 3 (a) was already being carried out and was in no way objectionable, and 3 (b) was a proposal for financial assistance.SIR PHILIP CUNLIFFE-LISTER considered that this proposal was &quot;not limited to the granting of positive financial assistance, but went even further and might be read to mean assistance by imposing economic restrictions on the aggressor.LORD CECIL did not consider that this was intended, as the whole proposal was to grant help to a State &quot;which had been attacked.&quot; It was, however, a purely political question.Proposal 3 (c) he considered most hazardous and should not be accepted on any account. He thought it was very difficult to determine in the course of one meeting the policy that should now be adopted.in regard to these proposals. He suggested that the Committee might be prepared to accept those which suggested merely the hastening of the machinery and should reject those which involved the creation of specific Military and Economic organisations. He thought that His Majesty&apos;s Government might be prepared to make a proposal such as that put forward by the Treasury for the granting of positive financial assistance and might consent to the use of the Fleet in certain circumstances (Mr. Bridgeman interpolated a word of caution on this point) and to the employment of Air squadrons if, as a result, some really practical agreement could be reached in regard to a reduction of Air forces. In regard to Economic Sanctions, short of war, he thought it was quite impossible for the Government to -accept any proposals unless an undertaking
was received from the Americans that they would not oppose them. On this point he had asked Mr. Gibson what the action of the United States of America would be, and whether the United States Government would be likely to adopt a benevolent attitude in the event of Economic Sanctions having to be taken against an aggressor. Mr. Gibson had replied that if the question was put to him at the present time his reply would have to be unf favour-able, but if, at a later stage, it was found that the success or failure of a disarmament scheme turned on the attitude which the United States of America would be likely to adopt in regard to Economic Sanctions, then he thought that possibly the U.S.A. Government might be prepared to adopt a non-obstructive attitude. Lord Cecil added that in his view it was necessary to have time to consider the policy which His Majesty&apos;s Government should adopt, and suggested that the Foreign Secretary should press for a reference of the proposals to the Committee of the Council, and should state quite definitely that further time was required by His Majesty&apos;s Government for their due consideration. A further advantage in adopting this course lay in the fact that Baron Bernsdorff, who had accepted the proposal to refer the whole matter to the Council, had been attacked in his own country for having agreed to refer the consideration of Article 16 to a body on which Germany was not represented. That difficulty could be got over as Germany could attend the meetings of the Committee of the Council.What had impressed him most at Geneva was the seriousness with which the whole question of disarmament was approached by all the Delegations. The French, he felt convinced, intended to put forward genuine proposals. Disarmament was no longer within the range of academic talk only and something definite would have to be done.SIR AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN stated that he agreed with Lord Cecil as to the seriousness with which we ought to approach the question. Limitation and reduction of armaments was plart of our declared policy and the object of the Locarno treaties was to give security which would make disarmament possible. If disarmament did not result, there would be very general disappointment in this country. The proposal to refer the matter to the Committee of the Council, with Germany invited to attend, was attractive from his point of view. But it must be borne in mind that if the question was referred to the Committee M. Boncourt would be the French Representative, and he felt there were advantages in dealing with M. Briand. At his instructions, Sir William Tyrrell had seen M. de Fleuriau, and had told him with what concern His Majesty&apos;s Government had learnt of M. Boncourfs communication, since this was, in effect, a return to the Protocol Avhich had been rejected by His Majesty&apos;s Government. The French Ambassador had promised to lay before his Government without delay the considerations urged by Sir William Tyrrell.*&apos; In a later interview M. de Fleuriau had given him (Sir Austen Chamberlain) to understand that he himself and some of his friends in Paris had been rather concerned at the line taken in the French proposals, which he had attributed to the personal views of M. Boncourt. Sir A. Chamberlain suggested that if M. Briand did not attend the next meeting of the Council, the best course would be to ask questions with a view to discovering what really was involved in the French proposals and to get the consideration of the question postponed. If, on the other hand, M. Briand did come to the Council, he thought it would be better to try and eliminate some of the proposals which had been put forward by M. Boncourt. The line which he proposed to adopt -was that the Covenant provided only for generalities and that it was not reasonable to expect a country to undertake to do in every case what it might be prepared to do in any one particular case. He had asked M. Briand some time ago whether, in regard to the Tacna-Arica dispute, the French Government would be prepared to do in. the event of an aggression by either Chile or Peru, as much as they would be prepared to do in the event of Poland being attacked by Russia, The effect of asking for specific undertakings under a general agreement applicable to all conceivable cases was merely to get as answer the minimum of assistance which would be rendered in the case in which the State giving the reply had the least interest. If. then, people were led to believe that what had been put forward as a minimum was really the maximum of assistance which would be obtained in any one particular case, dissatisfaction only could result.    Nor was it possible to devise* For details, see Sir Austen Chamberlain&apos;s despatches to Lord Crewe of the 28th and 31st May, (C.i.d. paper 694-B).
measures of security for each and every case. He would be loath to go as far as Lord Cecil had indicated and to make general suggestions, such as the strength of the air forces which we would be prepared to put at the disposal of the League of Nations for action against an aggressor.LORD CECIL thought that the French would be agreeable to limiting their armaments if they knew for certain that the armaments of Great Britain would come to their assistance.SIR AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN said that the real security which we offered to France was borne out by our history, since in every case where we had undertaken to come to another country&apos;s assistance we had done so with all our available resources. He suggested that, with regard to the French proposals, we could accept 1 (a), and could agree to enquire into the significance of 1 (&amp;), subject to an explana-tion as to whether the unanimity rule was involved. He considered that 2 (a) was an impossible task, and that it would be necessary to define more clearly what was involved in 2 (b). If this proposal was to set up some form of general staff with a view to elaborating plans, then, in his view^, the proposal was laughably, imprac-ticable. The proposal at 2 (c) might be accepted, and the experience of the Graeco-Bulgarian dispute might afford a useful precedent on which some system might be based. 3 (a), he considered, was acceptable, while 3 (b) and 3 (c) were wholly impossible.LORD SALISBURY enquired what the bearing of these proposals would be in relation to the assurance which had been given to Germany at the Locarno Con-ference in regard to Article 16. If the proposals were referred to the Council, Germany might object that this course was inconsistent with the undertaking given at the Locarno Conference.SIR AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN explained that the Covenant left the Council to recommend what military assistance should be rendered to each State, and each State was then free to determine what assistance it would in fact give. In regard to economic sanctions, the Council could allow time before sanctions were put into effect, but the obligations were imperative upon all. He had already pointed out to M. Briand that the French, in regard to all these proposals, approached the matter purely from the point of view of a land Power, and had asked him to regard the question also from the point of view of a sea Power, since the imposition of economic sanctions was practically confined to the realm of the sea.LORD CECIL held that, although under Article 16 there was absolute obligation to cut off economic relations, yet it was left to each State to decide whether a casus fcederis had really arisen, and it was an implied condition that all other Powers would take similar and simultaneous action.LORD BALFOUR considered that the position in regard to the French pro-posals was very difficult indeed. In his view, while several of the proposals were impracticable, it was.of importance to realise that if we adopted too critical an attitude it might have a disastrous effect. The question was how we were to deal with this position, and he suggested that the best course was&apos; to ask those who were responsible for these proposals to apply them to, say, half a dozen concrete cases. We might say that we were anxious to do all that we could to forward the cause of disarmament, and would be read3^ *0 ^au in with anjr practical scheme would could be introduced for this purpose. In any event, he thought that we should certainly refuse to discuss proposals affecting Article .16 at any Conference in which the Germans did not participate.Conclusion.The Committee of Imperial Defence agreed To recommend that at the forthcoming meeting of the Council of the League of Nations the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should be given a free hand to make the best arrangement he could on the lines of his own proposals and of the trend of the discussion as recorded above.
(2.) PRIVATE MANUFACTURE OF ARMS, AMMUNITION and implements  OF  WAR.(OLD. Paper No. 68.4-B.)(Previous Reference: OLD. Minutes of 199th Meeting, Minute 2.)THE COMMITTEE had under consideration the Report of the Sub-Committee on the Private Manufacture of Arms, Ammunition and Implements of War (OLD. Paper No. 684-B).LORD BALFOUR stated that this question was one of urgency, and he suggested that the Committee should approve the Report forthwith.SIR MAURICE HANKEY explained that the reason for the urgency was that the replies were due to reach Geneva by the 1st June.Conclusion.The Committee of Imperial Defence agreed To approve the Report of the Sub-Committee on the Private Manufacture of Arms, Ammunition and Implements of War (Paper No. 684-B).(3.) IMPERIAL CONFERENCE, 1926.Consideration of Papers for Circulation to the Governments of theDominions and India.(OLD. Papers Nos. 264-C, 266-C, 267-C, 268-C, 269-C, 270-C and 687-R)(Previous References : OLD. Minutes of 175th Meeting, Minute 4, 176th Meeting, Minute 1, 177th Meeting, Minute 1 and 178th Meeting, Minute 9.)THE COMMITTEE had under consideration the Report of the Sub-Committee on Foreign Policy and Defence covering a number of documents for circulation to the Governments of the Dominions and India.SIR MAURICE HANKEY explained that these papers had to leave by the next mail in order to reach their destination before the Dominion Representatives left for the Imperial Conference. He pointed out that the papers would be considered by Lord Salisbury&apos;s Cabinet Committee that afternoon, and suggested that, if approved by the Cabinet Committee, the Committee of Imperial Defence should take note of this approval.LORD BALFOUR suggested that Lord Salisbury should bring to the attention of the Committee of Imperial Defence any points in the papers under consideration which, in his view, should be referred to that body.Mr. AMERY considered that the only paper on which discussion was required was that which referred to the Allocation of Quotas to the Separate Parts of the Empire.Conclusion.The Committee of Imperial Defence agreed -(a.) To accept the recommendations of Lord Salisbury&apos;s Cabinet Committee (of which the three Service Ministers are members) in regard to the papers which had been prepared for communication to the Governments of the Dominions and of India;(&amp;.) That Lord Salisbury should bring to the attention of the Committee of Imperial Defence any questions in these papers which, in his view, ought to be referred to that body.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1, June 1, 1926.-
