This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;a Government.Printed for the Cabinet, July, 1926SECRET. q. copy No.    wCP. 283 (26). ,THE CABINET.DISPOSAL OF BARRACKS AT ENNISKILLEN.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.Until recently there has been a detachment at Enniskillen of one company belonging     119 to a battalion, the remainder of which is quartered at Londonderry.   Consequent on a    Irish recent re-distribution of troops in Northern Ireland it has been found possible to      66 concentrate the whole battalion at Londonderry, with an annual saving in transport and maintenance charges ot  some ;E4,000 a year.   The removal of the company from Enniskillen completes the evacuation of British troops from that town, and all War Department buildings there are now available for disposal.   They consist of : 1. The Castle Barracks. 2. The Main Barracks. 3. The Redoubt Hospital.*The following facts must be taken into consideration in deciding how to dispose of these buildings : 1. The Castle itself, which is included in the Castle Barracks, is an historic building, formerly recognised as such by the Board&apos; of Public Works in Dublin. I submit that it should now be handed over to the Government of Northern Ireland with a view to its being maintained at the expense of that Government as an historic building. The Castle is.of no value apart from the value of the site on which it stands and the stones and mortar of which it is built.2. As regards the remaining buildings mentioned above, the sale value of which is estimated at between  6,500 and  7,000, it has to be remembered that Enniskillen is a &quot; frontier town &quot; which has in the past played an important part in the history of civil war in Ireland, and might again become strategically important if trouble breaks out in the future. It is, therefore, undesirable that the barracks should be acquired by and come under the control of possibly ill-disposed persons. The risk may not be a large one at present, but it looms large in the eyes of the people of Enniskillen, to whose susceptibilities I think we should give some consideration. They have sent a deputation to me which expressed bitter regret at the final departure of British troops from Enniskillen and some concern at the possibility that the barracks might, at some future date, pass into hostile hands. I think, therefore, that it would be undesirable to put the buildings up to auction in the usual way. I should prefer in the first place to endeavour to negotiate a sale to the Government of Northern Ireland in order that that Government, may exercise control over their eventual ownership if they consider it necessary to do so. But I may find some resistance to the suggestion of any payment being required for the barracks, especially if the Government of Northern Ireland wish to retain them in their own hands.I should, therefore, like Cabinet approval 1. To hand over the Castle at Enniskillen to the Government of Northern Ireland,.on the understanding that it will he maintained as an historic building. 2. To offer the remaining buildings to the Government of Northern Ireland at avaluation, or in the last resort to make them a free gift of the buildings.L.
