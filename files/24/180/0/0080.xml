REPORT OF THE LEGISLATION 0CMM2TTEE. Memor a u fl urajbs;^ t he Pr esident^,.. Bpara^of, Ed up at ion.In view of the further consideration now being given to the question of Trades Union Legislation, I should like to raise,  for consideration,  three points upon the-Report of the Legislation Committee (Paper No, CP. 237(26)).The first point relates to tactics.    There is probably very general agreement on four of tho Committee&apos;s proposals,l*6is ,(l) Legislation on the lines of the&apos;Illegal Strikes Bill. (2)    Legislation on Civil Servants.(3)    Legislation prohibiting Local Authorities from having any regard to membership or non-membership of Trades Unions on the part of their servants or of candidates for employment.(4)    Compulsory registration of Trades Unions0While there is much to be said for delaying legislationuntil an,;exhaustive Bill can be introduced,  I am inclined tothink that the Government&quot; s intention to legislate on (l),(2) and  (3)  should be announced at an early moment.    Anannouncement in regard to (2) has already been decided on and(2) is only its counterpart In the sphere of local administra-tion.   While the necessity for legislation as to (l) for thepurpose of carrying out the Prime Minister1s pledge during thegeneral strike does not appear to be urgent on our present information,  I am afraid that an uncomfortable feeling will soon grow up throughout the country that the pledge is notbeing completely honoured, and it is vital to forestall anysuch feeling.imiiidhllllllllinilllliw IIMIMIMMHHi..........
The second point relates to the Committee1s proposal to create a new statutory category of &quot;unauthorised&quot; strikes. Is this method necessary, whatever may be our final decision on the question of the secret ballot ?     It has certain obvious disadvantages.   At present an &quot;authorised&quot; strike means,  in common parlance, a strike authorised by the Executive of the Trades Union concerned,     Under the Committee^ scheme it would moan a Strike authorised by three-fifths of the members of the Union in a ballot conducted by the Registrar-General and at which at least 50 per cent,  of the members vote.    At present any fines or penalties inflicted upon members of the Union who do not join in an &quot;authorised&quot; strike have behind them nothing but the authority of the executive of the Union and the general feeling among its members, but in future they might come to be regarded as having behind  them something of the nature of official authority.    At least,  the infliction of such fines and penalties wotild be implicitly oonternplated by Statute   and the procedure leading to the Strike would have a sort of imprimatur from a high official of the Government. It would surely be simpler to proceed in another way-    If registration is to be compulsory, can we not lay down conditions that must be satisfied for the purposes of such registration; can we not give the Registrar-General power to remove or suspend from the register any Union which contravenes these conditions; and can we not provide that only a registered union should enjoy the benefits of the Trades Disputes Act ?The third point, is one which is not alluded to in the Committee^ Report.    The powers of a Trades Union in relation to its members are open to criticism in two distinct respects. The first is that workmen may be compelled to strike in support-xng demands which may have no connection with conditions in
in their own industry and on which they heve had no adequate opportunity of expressing their opinion.    The second is that the penalties exacted by a Union from one of its members who refuses to go on strike may include total or partial loss of benefits not really connected with the industrial functions of the Union at all.    The Heport deals with the first of those two criticisms hut not with the second and the draft Bill implies that, provided a strike is not &quot;illegal&quot; or &quot;unauthorised&quot; a Union is fully justified in exacting any penalty from its members which it has power to inflict under the law as it now stands.    Is this a view which would be supported by public opinion ?    In many industries, membership of the Union is practically compulsory;    a man has no choice but to join.    But the justification for the existanee of the Union Is that it discharges one or more of three functions; as a body representing its members in discussions or disputes with employers;    as a provident society which ensures to them certain benefits quite apart from any disputes with- employers; or as a body formed for  the purposes of party politics.    We are probably all agreed in principle that the third function should be kopt separate from the others and that legislation to this effeot should be passed.    But in regard to the first two functions,  quite apart from the distinction between an &quot;authorised1 end an &quot;unauthorised&quot; strike,  is it justifiable that a workman who finds himself In a minority in a strike ballot, who refuses to strike, and who,  in consequence,  is dismissed from his Union, should forfeit his rights in relation to the provident funds of the Union to which he has been a subscriber ?     It is quite fair that he should be subject to loss of membership of the Union in its industrial capacity if he refuses to join a strike called in accordance with the union rules;    it is quite fair that he should,  in consequence, forfeit any rights he possesses ss a subscriber to strike funds and the like; and consequently
he cannot complain if, as an alternative to being turned out of the union, he is called upon to pay fines and penalties. What does not seem to he fair is that a body discharging the functions^ of a Provident Society should he enabled to require one of its members, on the pain of forfeiting his accrued rights as a contributor, to take action which,  in certain circumstances, will directly involve the loss of his livelihood.    It would indeed, presumably, be impossible to require that Provident Societies shall not have rules involving loss of membership cn grounds other than failuro to pay subscriptions of the like, for I understand that even members of an Approved Society have no absolute right to retain their membership if they cease to be members of the parent association.    We can, however, require that a man who loses his membership in such circumstances as those here in question shall be entitled to a return of his contributions or suoh other payment as may be necessary to ensure that he does not forfeit his accrued rights and we can make it a oondition of registration that the rules of a Trades Union shall provide for this.E.
