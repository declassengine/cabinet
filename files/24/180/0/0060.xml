DOCUMENT 15 THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C R E T. 259(26) .R Copy NO.C A.....B I N S &quot; .URCHASE OF COAL,Rjpcrt by the Finance Sub-Committee of the Supp&quot;ly and Transport Committee,(Circulated at the request of the Home Secretary).Representatives of the Treasury, Mines Department and Board of Trade considered the question of the purchase of coal in accordance with the decision of the Cabinet of the 28th instant.     Representatives of the Mines Department reported that it would be necessary to place orders at once for 4 weeks&apos; supply at the rate of 250,000 tons per week.     As far as possible the supply would be purchased from the Continent but it was anticipated that it would be necessary to resort to America owing to continental supplies becoming exhausted. Continental supplies were already fully booked up until the end of July.     The Board of Trade representatives represented that 4 weeks purchase at a time would be necessary owing to the exigencies of shipping.      Coal ordered immediately would not arrive in this country for 7 weeks but payment must be made for coal ordered within 7 days of the order being placed.As regards the cost of coal,  it was anticipated that the cost of coal delivered in British ports woiild not be less than  2 per ton,  of which about 22/- would be cost of coal and 18/-would be freight.     The expenses of delivery, agency, etc. from British ports would be roughly another  1 per ton, making a total cost of  3 per ton.As concerns receipts it could not be expected that these would be available until roughly a fortnight after delivery,say lo weeks from the date of ordering coal.      It was agreedthat if the coal strike continued,  it would be-1-
necessary to continue purchases of coal, and in the opinion of the Mines Department representatives,  suoh purchases should be made to cover periods of 4 weeks.The best method, It was agreed,  of financing these transactions would be to ask Parliament for a revolving credit of ^3 millions.    This sum would include the amount previously approved for purchases already made of 200,000 tons.    As it is probable that there might be some delay in payment both of freight charges, end of delivery charges and as it would be possible to obtain some advance from the Civil Contingencies Fund, the result of having this revol-ving credit would be that sufficient funds would remain available for financing further purchases of coal, should they be necessrry.    It was considered that so long as the strike continued, sales of ooal could be made at such a price as would result in little or no loss being incurred; but if the strike broke, the prospect of some loss must bo faced.    The sum ultimately remaining from the revolving credit would be surrendered to the Exchequer.The Mines Department representatives stated that endeavour would be made to include in contracts a &quot;break&quot; clause under which forfeit would be payable in lieu of acceptance of deliveries not required.    They were,  however, doubtful of the practicability of making such an arrangement.Trading accounts should be maintained of all the transactions,  Treasury direction being given under Section 5 of the Exchequer and Audit Department Act, 1921.Signed on behalf of the Sub-Committee, R.S. MMKLEJOHN,Chairman.Tr ea sury,June ?.9th, 1926.
