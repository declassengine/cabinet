Memorandum by tho lord Chance 11 or.I desire to keep my colleagues informed as to the conduct of &quot;labour&quot; magistrates on and off the Bench dim ring the General Strike.In the first place, as regards allegations made against &quot;labour&quot; magistrates when acting otherwise than in the discharge of their duties as Justices of the Peace,  I have received complaints about 50 such magistrates.    Of these, seven hed been convicted either of offences against the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act, 1075 or against the Emergency Regulations 19S6,  or of the offence of obstructing the highway.      The remaining forty-three were accused by the complainants of acts which might in some cases,  as reported to me, have justified proceedings being taken against them. In twenty-four of those cases,- mainly oases in which the magistrates had only joined in or encouraged the strike,  I took no action;    but as to the  remaining cases,  in which charges of intimidation or other illegal conduct were made, I celled upon the magistrates concerned for an explanation.After considering the explanation given,  I thought it my duty to remove four Justices from the Bench or (in two instances) to exclude them from the exercise of their functions as ox-of ficio Justices.    Details of these cases will be found in Schedule A-      It will be noticed that in only one of these four cases removal follows upon a conviction,
but the conduct of the magistrates in the other cases wof such-ture as wholly to unfit them from exercisingmagisterial functions.In nine other cases, after considering the explanatory-ation given to me by the magistrates concerned, I decided that it was sufficient to inform thorn that their conduct was deserving of censure; but of these, two, vio were members of my Advisory Committees, have boen relieved from attendance on those Committees.     A list of these magistrates will be found in Schedule B.to observations which have been made in Parliament, that only one complaint has reached me of intemperate language on the part of a magistrate on the Bench when dealing with  offences against the Emergency Regulations or otherwise in connection with the Strike.    In reply to my remonstrance, this magistrate admitted that his observations might have been framed in more suitable language.My attention has been drawn to a somewhat seriousattempt in the West Riding of Yorkshire to interfere with the course of justice.    A letter, having the appearance of a circular and issued from the Doncaster and District Trades and labour Council, was placed in my hands.    It ran as follows&quot;Dear Comrade,At Our monthly Meeting held on Tuesday the 15th inst. , I was directed to write to you as follcws:-In the opinion of this Council, the savage sentences inflicted daring this dis-pute, would not have been given, had our Magistrates been in attendance.    It is amatter of &quot;Gross Eeglect&quot; of Duty---, ,audwe call upon you to be in your place cnf all possible occasions. &apos;There remain 13 cases,upon which I am stillseeking information.I should add in this connection, having regardYours fraternallyE. 1.   GEE2,Secretary *
I considered, in consultation with the Attorney GoneirJkJti and the Director of Public Prosecutions, whether any formal step could be taken in this natter; but I came to the conclusion that the best coux-se would be for the Chairman of the Bench to deliver e warning at the next meeting of the Petty Sessional Bench,  and he accordingly did so.I have received information of a further antici-pated attempt of the same nature in the same county. Some eighty or more persons convicted at the Lower Stafforth and Tickhill Petty Sessional Court, held at Doncaster,  of various offences under the Regulations, have appealed to Quarter Sessions, and the appeals will bo heard on the 27th July.      I am informed both by the Chairman of the West Riding Quarter Sessions and by the Chairman of the Lower Strafforth and Tickhill Bench that it is feared that an attempt will be made to pack the Bench at Leeds with a view to quashing the convictions. I am awaiting further information from the locality on this matter.flntdo)    C.House of lords,,19th July,  19 6.

On the same day, in a tobacconist&apos;s shop in Tunstall, he used abusive lanuguage against volunteer drivers of motor &apos;buses, saying that they ought to be shot.The allegation was that Dohert?/, as Chairman of the Kiisyth Trades &amp; Labour Council Issued permits to drivers of motor vehicles to use the highway during the strike.    I was satisfied in spite of his denial, not only that he issued permits (one of which signed by him is In my possession) but that he directed the operations of those who obstructed the highway ex-cept to users of permits.Bolton was charged under the Emergency Regulations, 1926, with another defend-ant, with attempting to impede the distribution of foodstuffs.    He was convicted and sentenced to a fine of  50 or two months1 imprisonment.    He was an ex-officio Justice of the Peace.
