(This dooument is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government)0 A B I I E T.P, 229 (26). J   0ASOOT    MEETING.Memorandum by the Home Secretary.I understand the Mines Department are not objecting to the holding of any Race Meetings provided that no special trains are run and that the meeting does not make an undue call on the police - especially the   police in mining areas. I presume therefore there will bs no interference with Ascot.In view, however, of newspaper reports that the cancellation of the Ascot meeting was under consideration, I have received representations from the Incorporated Association of Retail Distributors that such a step &quot;would be a very serious blow to the British fashion and textile houses, and prevent any possibility of the large distributing houses   making up any loss which they have suffered through the General Strike&quot;I have told the Association I would put their views before the Cabinet.W.J.H.;:8th June,  1926 .
