SIR R.bAKDERS.In introducing this Deputation,  and in thanking you for receiving it at a tiae when you have so many calls, episcopal and otherwise,  on your time, may I venture to remind you that we were promised that the Second Chamber question should he dealt with by the Coalition Government of 1918 and that the promise has been renewed by each Conservative Government since that date;    also that year after year resolutions have been carried unanimously at the national Union Conference calling on the Government to deal wi th it.We do not cone to you today to offer you. a considered scheme.    That -re feel would be presumptuous, but we think it may be of use  to you. anc1 to the Government to tell you what is the opinion of many Conservatives who have studied the matter as to the broad lines on which a satisfactory scheme could be ba.sed.    We therefore venture to put before you the results of the last meeting of our Committee in the House of Commons which was attended by some 80 members.It was there unanimously agreed that the Parliament Act is admittedly a, temporary and incomplete measure.It was agreed (nearly unanimously)  that the necessary amendment of the Parliament Act ought to be considered without delay.It was unanimously agreed that the duty of defining what is or is not a. honey Sill should no longer rest with the Speaker.It was agreed (nearly unanimously)  that no hill rejected by the Second Chambers shadl become law without reference to the electorate, provided always that the Second Chamber be reconstituted on a more democratic basis than the existing House of Lords.
It was unanimously agreed that in cases of difference between the two Houses., which, cannot he settled by conference and negotiation;  the Government may resort to a ReferendumA long discussion on the &quot;Hereditary Element&quot;  tookplace.When put to the vote 33 voted against the hereditary element,  and 26 for it,  a number refraining from voting.You will see from this that-there ia considerable and not unhealthy divergence of opinion as to the most appropriate medicine, but we are all profoundly impressed with the gravity of the disease.The danger we apprehend- is not ao much that of the Socialists getting a maj oritj&quot; in the countrjr.    Should they do that it is possible that no constitutional impediment would restrain them very long.    Personally I do not think it likely that th.ey will get such a maj ority for some years at all events.    What is more than possible is that without a majority in the country they ma2r have as we have now a considerable majority in the House of Commons.In that case they could under the Parliament Act pass In one year any measure certified &quot;by their Speaker to be financial,  and in two years any measure of any sort or kind without consulting the people in any way.    That is a very great danger.    It is one that we think it is particularly the duty of a Government with a big majority to deal with.    And we j.eupectfully urge that a start ought to be made next session in order that a remedial measure may,be given every chance to pass,  and in order that it may not be new to the electorate when an election comes on.
LORD IlIDLiiiTOlT:      I have &quot;been  asked by the Committee of Pears who have interested themselves in this matter of reform,  to submit to you the views which they have drawn up with regard to the treatment of this subject.As Sir Robert Sanders hss reminded you of the period which has elapsed since this question was raised,  I would point out to you that we Peers had a- distinct pledge sixteen years ago that the Parliament Act should be followed at once by the  consideration of the question of House of Lords reform, but although four Prime Ministers have followed each other that has not yet taken place,   and we make a great appeal to you that this question should now be regarded as urgent.We are able to give you  some assurances, which nobody has yet been able to do,  of the opinion generally felt by the House of Lords.    Through the medium of the Association of Independent Unionist Peers we have been able to ascertain the views of between 200 and 300 Unionist Peers on the question  of Second Chamber Reform.    Between 50 and 60 Peers are present here today,  and a considerable number have expressed regret that they have not been able to attend. We are well aware of the great claims on your time at this moment - we had hoped that this deputation would have been called a little earlier in the Session - and since you gave us the notice we have found a considerable number of Peers out of reach, but I hope you will not take it,  for that reason,  that the numbers present,   considerable though    they are,  represent in any sense the numbers who are deeply interested in the proposals for reform.
Tiie vast majority of those we have consulted,between 200 and 300, have signified in writing -(l)    It is regarded as imperative that the question should be dealt with ty the present Government - if possible in the next Session of Parliament. (2)    The Parliament Act is held to require amendment (a)  in regard to the Speaker&apos;s sole discretion as to Honey Bills,  (b)  as regards the power of the House of Commons under the Parliament Act to pass measures of Constitutional change affecting the Crown and Second Chamber or Parliament as the soleabsence of any provision for settling differences between the two Houses - either by Referendum or oth erwi se.(3)    Provided that the Parliament Act can be so amended that drastic changes cannot be carried through without the will  of the people being clearly ascertained,  the great maj oritjr of peers whose opinions we have ascertained xsre willing to accept changes in the personnel of the House of Lords. They recognise that the numbers of the House should be reduced and that opportunity should be given for the admission of men representing all political parties, but they are not prepared to sacrifice for themselves and their descendants their hereditary right to sit and vote unless some proportion&apos; of the new House be chosen by the existing peers,  (Hear, hear) a large number of whom have been raised to the peerage by the Cr^wn -on their merits, and even a larger number have served the Crown in important positionsa We submit that such a link between the new House and the old would be wholly in accord with the methods of conotitutionalinstrument of legislation,as regards the
change upheld toy the Conservative party in thi.3 country from time immemorial.Subject-to the above, provided that the measure be a simple one dealing with as few questions as possible and be put forward with the authority of the Government, we anticipate that its passage through the House of Lords would be assured.In regard t.6 that final paragraph I may point out to you that no body of men have ever previously ventured, or been in a position, to give any assurance because this is the first time that the mass of the Peers have been consulted upon the question.

PRIME k&quot;Il: T3TEE:      Perhaps I owe you an apology for not having met this deputation &quot;before, but I em very glad to meet it to-day and I hare invited to meet you those of mycolleagues who have been specially interested in the examination of this question for the benefit of the Cabinet - I think the only absentees are Lord Cave and the Chancellor of the Ex-chequer, who are otherwise occupied at the moment - and I am sure that they, as I, have listened to what has been said with a good deal of sympathy and a good deal of agreement.Your observations on the delinquencies of my predecessorsdo not interest me, I have quite enough to do to deal with my own, and I could not help feeling, when Sir Robert Sanders saidthat he had no considered scheme ready because he thought itmight be presumptuous, it was a touch of modesty which was quiteunnecessary, because it certainly would have been helpful;&apos;   Itis quite true, as he said, that a, divergence of opinion is notunhealthy, but we must cep.se. to diverge when we stop talkingcanand must converge before we/do something.All that I have to say to you this afternoon is to repeat, perfectly definitely, a pledge which I believe I have already given, that we shell deal with this question in the lifetime of the present Parliament (Hear, hear).      I cannot tell you yet in what form.     We have had a Ca,binet Committee working for some time on this subject.      I think they are approaching the end of their labours if they have not completed them.      The Cabinet have not yet investigated what they have done, which must of course be the next step, but as soon as we have had time to examine it and have decided upon whatever measure of reform we may deem to be necessary, we shall take all the necessary steps to carry that out, and, speaking for myself as for my colleagues here and for all the Government, it will be within the lifetime of the present Parliament, which I believe is what you require.
Sill R. 3AI&apos;/D:-.2l3 :      On &quot;behalf of the deputation, I thank you very much indeed for having received us, and we thank you also for the statement that you have made.       he are exceedingly glad to hear that you have undertaken to deal with this most import-ant matter within the lifetime of the present Parliament, and we can only say that any assistance that any of us can give you in so dealing with it will be given con anore,     &apos;.7e thank you very much.PRIME LiliTISTER:     We should be very glad of assistance if the members either of the Lords Committee or of the Commons Com-mittee or of both can come to any genera.1 measure of agreement. I say that in all sincerity and not because I do not recognise, as you all do, what the difficulties are, but if itshould happen that you cone to a.ny close measure ofagreement, that would obviously be of the greatestassistance to the Cabinet, and we should welcome it.(The proceedings then terminated and the deputation withdrew).Rouse of Commons  (Westminster akali) Tuesday,: 20th July 1926
