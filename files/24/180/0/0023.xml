CONSTITUTIONAL PQSITIOH OF THE BRITISH LEGION. MEMORANDUM BY TEE MINISTER OF PENSIONS.I think it right to direct the attention of the Cabinet to a resolution unanimously passed on May 24th at the second Session of the British Legion conference and to certain other proceedings of the British Legion which threaten to raise a somewhat serious constitutional issue.The resolution was as follows:-&quot;This conference resolves that, in view of the reply given to the deputation of the Council by the existing Minister of Pensions with regard to the seven years&apos; limit, and having regard to the existing uns^a/satisfactory working of the pensions administration, we amend the constitution and rules of the Legion so that definite steps may be taken to use the whole force of the Legion in a constitutional mariner to oppose every Parliamentary candidate who has voted against the pensions policy of the Legion&quot;.Before the resolution was put to the meeting the Chairman explained that the Executive council of the Legion had arranged for a &quot;national campaign regarding final awards and the seven years1 limit&quot;, these being the two subjects on which the Legion dispute the decision of the Government.The British Legion was granted a Royal charter last year and by Article 49 no rule or alteration of a rule can come into force without the approval and certification of the Privy Council.      such approval will presumably not be granted to the changes proposed by the resolution and the constitution will no doubt be maintained as It stands.This, however, does not dispose of the difficulty because the Legion has already taken concerted action in the sense of the resolution without waiting for the sanction of an amended Charter,     Members who have voted in the House of Commons against proposals favoured by the Legion have been subjected to attacks in their constituencies organized from London, speeches have been made by prominent officers of the Legion and circulars have been issued from Legion Headquarters attacking the policy of the Government.     In the May number of the British Legion Journal there appears an offensive political cartoon directed against the Economy Bill which is a definite reflection 09.the financial policy of the Government in ite relation-ib the three fighting services.The Patron of the Legion is the Prince of Wales and other members of the Royal Family have given it their countenance and support.      On the first day of the Conference at which the resolution above referred to was passed the meeting was addressed by His Royal Highness and the King himself was present at a ceremonial parade., These manifestations of Royal favour have been used in the press as arguments to induce or compel the Government to depart from a definite decision of policy.      If thatdecision(This document is the property of His BritannicMajesty&apos;s Government). H   iy
decision is maintained as I presume it will be, and if the intentions of the Legion are carried out as can hardly be doubted, the Prince of Wales will be placed in the position of supporting, as Patron.an agitation directed ag&amp;lnst His Majesty&apos;s Government and their supporters and the Crown itself can scarcely fail to be gravely embarrassed,While I do not consider that a position of acute crisis has yet been reached I suggest that before more serious developments occur it,will be wise to1consider whether the King&apos;s attention should hot be drawn to what: has happened. - -I should be glad, therefore, if a Cabinet Committee could be appointed to consider(1) the constitutional issues raised by recent proceedings of the British Legion in view of the provisions of the Royal Charter and of the Royal patronage which they enjoy, and -(2) the steps to be taken to deal with the political campaign which has been launched by the British Legion against the Government in the constituencies.( Signed)   &apos;  &apos; G.C. TRYON.Minister of Pensions.Ministry of Pensions. 4th June, 1926.
