The Miners&apos; federation of GreatBritain, 55, Russell Square,London, .7.C. 1.ItJiBOIUTIOI.This Committee having- given long and careful consideration to the terms submitted by the Prime Minister as a basis for a settlement together with what transpired at the interview with him Tuesday,  arrived at the following conclusions        &apos;He are largely in agreement with tho legislative and administrative proposals setforth and    are prepared to render every assistance possible to ensure their success, but    seo no reason why such measures should be first reviewed by the Coal Advisory Committee.we are unable to recommend the mineworkers to accept his proposal for a reduction in their wages which admittedly do not at present provide for a decent standard of living.We further object to the proposal that a Board with an Independent Chairman shall be empowered to abolish the National Minimum and enforce varying mlnimas throughout the die triots.v/e consider that in making these proposals,  the PrimeMinister is not honouring the pledge he gave to the countryin the massage broadcast on the 8th May as follows:-I wish to make it as clear as I can that the Government is not fighting to lower the standard of living of. the miners, or of any other section of the workers&quot;.
