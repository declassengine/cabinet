II[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]    e - q Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1926.SECRET. Copy No.    ^CP. 282 (26).CABINET.INTER-DEPARTMENTAL COMMITTEE ON GRANTS.INTERIM REPORT.To the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty&apos;s Treasury.May it please your Lordships,Terms of Reference and Introduction. WE were appointed by Treasury Minute of the 29th April, pursuant to a decision of the Cabinet that &apos;&apos; the question of the substitution for percentage grants of grants independent of expenditure for Education, Health and all other grant services should first be explored by an Inter-Departmental Committee to be set up by the Treasury, which should be asked to report not later than the end of May, with a view to further consideration of the question by the Cabinet.&quot; We regret that we were unable to report by the end of May. The time at our disposal, which covered the period of the general strike, has not permitted us to formulate a complete scheme of grants.   We have, however, decided to submit an interim report containing (a.) Some preliminary observations upon the general question which has been referred to us; and(&amp;.) Our recommendations as to the interim Education Grants for 1927 and the I two following years.The figures quoted throughout the Report are for England and Wales alone. In Scotland the system of local administration differs materially from that in England and Wales, and in some cases the basis of grant is also different. But we recognise that our final conclusions, mutatis mutandis, must be applicable to Scotland also. Our interim recommendations, on the other hand, are not intended to have any reference to Scotland, where the whole of the money available for Education is already distributed on a basis independent of expenditure.(A.) General Considerations. 2. The present sj^stem under which financial aid from the Exchequer is distributed to local authorities is full of anomalies and inconsistencies. A sum of  8-8 millions* is paid to local authorities in England and Wales from the Local Taxation Account. This sum represents the residue of Lord Goschen&apos;s attempt to solve the problem of the relations between local and national finance by assigning the produce of certain State revenues to locally administered services. Erom this source comes all the assistance given from the Exchequer in respect of Poor Law services, and a part of the assistance for Health, Police and Higher Education. After pro-viding for these services, a free balance of  2-5 millions is at the disposal of local authorities for general purposes.3. A second category of Exchequer grants is represented by those under the Agricultural Rates Acts of 1896 and 1923. A sum of  4-3 millions is provided out of the Consolidated Fund in aid of rates by these grants, which are not specifically attributable to any given local services. Broadly speaking, they result from a recognition by Parliament that it is unfair that agricultural land should be rated at more than a quarter of its full assessable value.  The grant goes to make up to local* Throughout tlii? report the fig-ares given relate to the vear 1924-25 unless otherwise stated.[14863] b
authorities the loss which they would otherwise suffer by this relief to the occupiers of agricultural land.4. Superimposed upon the foregoing grants, which are paid through the Local Taxation Account, are the grants provided on annual votes of Parliament in respect of Health, Police and Education. These amounted in 1924/25 to  45-2 millions. With minor exceptions, all these grants are calculated as a percentage of the expendi ture of local authorities, although in the case of elementary education other factors are taken into account.5. In a fourth category of grants are those in respect of roads, amounting to  14 millions, but these grants differ from those in other categories in that they are paid out of the Road Fund, which is derived from that part of the taxation of motor vehicles imposed in respect of their use of the roads. The road grants fall mainly under two heads : (1) those known as Classification Grants, which are contributions to works of maintenance approved by the Department on Class 1 and Class 2 Roads; like the Police, Education and Health grants, these roads grants are calculated as a percentage of the expenditure on the approved work; (2) contributions towards the capital cost of improvements or of new roads, which are contributions of a definite and limited sum towards the cost of the work, the amount of such contributions being arrived at generally as a percentage of an. approved estimate, though the percentage varies in individual cases.8. Of the grants not included in the above categories the most important are certain voted grants which represent the discharge of the Exchequer^ liabilities in respect of services undertaken in the past by local authorities involving a charge upon the Exchequer extending over a period of years. These include grants under the Addison Housing Scheme ( 7-3 millions), Land Settlement ( 0-9 millions), and grants in respect of Unemployment Works ( 1-7 millions).7. The above summary, which does not pretend to be comprehensive, may perhaps serve to show the extreme complication into which the system of Exchequer grants has fallen. This complication is aggravated by the multiplicity of local authorities which administer the services and receive the grants. Education is administered by 318 authorities, which comprise County Councils, County Borough Councils, and &quot; Part III &quot; authorities, i.e., certain non-county Boroughs, and Urban District Councils; Police by 183 authorities, Metropolitan, City of London, County and Borough; Health and Poor Laiv by 2,492 authorities, Boards of Guardians, County, Borough and District Councils; Roads by 1,872 authorities. Counties, Boroughs, and District Councils.8. In any readjustment of Exchequer grants on a coherent and logical system the problem will be greatly simplified if it can be carried through in conjunction with a simplification of the local administrative machinery. We recognise, however, that an attempt to transfer functions from the smaller Local Authorities to County Authorities would raise issues of a highly controversial character, and that it would be far from easy to carry a measure for this purpose through Parliament, more particularly if such a measure were to be introduced in advance of the Report of the Royal Commission on Local Government, which is inquiring into the relations between the larger and smaller Local Government Authorities. At the same time, we entertain little doubt that local administration would be greatly improved by such a simplification as we have in mind. An enlargement of the administrative area tends to have two important advantages : (i) it spreads the burden of rates more evenly, by flattening out extremes of high and low rates; and (ii) the larger authority can provide itself with better and more specialised equipment, can afford to pay higher salaries for its chief officers, and in many ways can make more effective use of both equipment and personnel according to varying needs, especially in times of emergency. The Minister of Health has in fact announced the intention to propose to Parliament a Bill transferring the powers and duties of Boards of Guardians to County Councils and County Boroughs, and County and County Borough Authorities already have the major part in the administrative system of Education and Police.9. The proposed Health legislation to which we have alluded could not, we assume, be introduced before 1927, and it is unlikely that it could come into operation before 1929. There are other circumstances also which render it impossible to expect an early general simplification of the grant system. The new Valuation Lists under the Rating and Valuation Act, 1925, will not be fully in force until 1929.   Moreover,
the settlement of the &quot; Burnham &quot; scales of Teachers&apos; Salaries the agreement for which runs to the 31st March, 1931 was accepted by local authorities subject to a proviso that the grant system shall not, in the meanwhile, be altered to their detriment. The bearing of these two facts upon the proposed scheme of grants will be discussed later. We mention them here to indicate that the introduction of a totally new scheme of grants is not to be looked for immediately.10. We understand that the most immediately pressing subject on which we are asked to report is the policy to be adopted at once in regard to Education grants. But if an immediate policy is to be adopted ad interim in regard to these grants, it is important that it should, so far as possible, be consistent with Government policy in regard to Exchequer grants generally, and should lead up to, rather than impede, an ultimate simplification.11. Exchequer grants to Local Authorities made in respect of services locally administered may be said generally to rest on the principle that national revenues, being levied over a wider field of contributors than local rates, ought to contribute towards the local administration of services of more than local interest and importance. The fact of Exchequer contribution enables the central departments to maintain a certain control over local activities with the view of the maintenance of the standard of efficiency.12. The essential feature of a percentage grant is that it varies with the expenditure of the local authority, rising as it rises, and falling with its fall. We read our terms of reference as directing us to explore the possibility of substituting for this form of grant an alternative which does not necessarily vary with the local fluctuations of expenditure.13. This alternative system should avoid the well-known defects of the percentage grant. These defects (which are in part no doubt balanced by some of the admitted advantages of the system) could be avoided by a system which placed on the local authority the whole burden of its expenditure above the amount of a fixed grant; which imjoosed on the Exchequer the liability to pay a fixed grant the amount of which would be determined from time to time in accordance with other national requirements; which adjusted grants with specific relation to local ability to pay; and which rendered it unnecessary for the central authority to approve or check the expenditure of the local authority in order to determine the grant.No Government, however, could permit local authorities to fall short of an adequate standard of service, and accordingly the system to be established would have to provide for the maintenance and enforcement, if necessary, of adequate standards.14. A grant system, devised to avoid the defects of the percentage grant and ex hypothesi unrelated to the actual expenditure of the several authorities, would have to be related either to particular grant-aided services, or generally to all services aided by grants from the Exchequer. These alternatives we have, for the sake of convenience, called the Service Grant system and the General Grant system.15. The essential feature of a Service Grant is that it relates to one type of service and is administered by the appropriate central department. It may be calculated upon one or more selected factors appropriate to the category of service, or upon general characteristics, or upon a combination of the two, e.g., for Education, the number of pupils or of teachers, for Roads, the mileage of the roads within the area or the ton-mileage of traffic, combined with a factor representing rateable value. Under this system it would be necessary to make a statistical review of the expenditure on the service, and in the light of the information thus obtained, to determine the amount appropriate to the unit selected.16. A General- Grant system, not being related on the one hand to expenditure or on the other hand to the characteristics of the specific services, might embrace in a single payment the Exchequer contribution in aid of the discharge by local authorities of their functions of more than local importance. Means would have to be found, in administering such a system, for preserving unimpaired the necessary powers of control exercised by the central departments of Government in order to secure an adequate standard of efficiency in the local services; for, although much detailed scrutiny of accounts could be given up, the central Government could not surrender its right to insist on efficient service and compliance with statutory[14863]   &apos; b 2
requirements as a condition of grant in such services as Police, Education, Roads and Public Health.17.   Inasmuch as these services have been, instituted to meet social needs, an important factor in any formula for a general grant should clearly be population and if the country were made up of similar and similarly situated local communities, there would be no need to seek any further factor.18. In practice, however, the constitution and circumstances of the several communities vary widely and the same services, administered to the same standard, will, therefore, in some areas involve a rate burden far higher than in others. We have no doubt as to the desirability and, indeed, the equity of adjustments for differences of wealth as expressed by the assessable value per head of population. The difficulty in making such adjustments, which arises from the absence of uniformity of assessment throughout the country, should largely be reduced by the operation of the Rating and Valuation Act, 1925.19. Under a Service Grant system, based on units, the action of the local authority would not affect the amount of grant per unit, but it might affect the number of units, e.g., hospital beds, or school places. Under a General Grant system, if an authority aims at attaining an exceptionally high standard of service and chooses, therefore, to adopt a more liberal scale of expenditure than its fellows, the excess expenditure it incurs falls upon the local ratepayer and is not shared by the Exchequer (as under the percentage grant system). But the question arises whether any formula would work equitably which did not give consideration to unavoidable differences of cost not resulting from causes in the control of the spending authority. A hilly county, for instance, or one not favourably situated as regards supply of road metal, will find it more expensive to maintain an equal mileage of roads than a flat county, or one well supplied with road metal. An extensive and thinly populated area may find the maintenance of schools more expensive than a more compact area of equal population. Ought the Exchequer grant to take such differences of cost into account as well as differences of rateable capacity ?20. The argument in favour of taking into account unavoidable differences of cost in determining the grant formula is that high costs constitute just as real handicap to a local authority as low rateable value, and that, where high costs, resulting perhaps from the physical or economic characteristics of the area, are unavoidable, in a service of national importance, the general taxpayer ought to come to the assistance of the local ratepayer to redress the balance. On the other hand, it is argued that it is not to the national interest to neutralise completely the natural disadvantages of the least favoured areas, and, further, that the practical difficulties of distinguishing between avoidable and unavoidable costs would be insurmountable. In extreme cases the distinction could no doubt be made, but in practice the tendency would be to argue that nearly all differences of cost were unavoidable, and the Government would then be driven back to an expenditure ba.sis with all its attendant disadvantages.21. On the answer to this question will largely turn the decision whether preference should be given to a Service Grant or to a General Grant system. Tf differences of necessary cost are to be taken into account, it seems improbable that they could be duly weighted except in a system of distinct grants applicable to each service. If, on the other hand, they can be ignored, the basis of grant will be the best index that can be found for the general economic conditions of the area, and would not differ for each service, and consequently separate grants need not be paid in respect of the grant-aided services. A single grant covering all the services would suffice so far as Governments financial responsibility is concerned. Whether the administrative difficulties can be overcome will require further examination. It is only when the application of any such proposal to a particular service is examined with reference to particular areas that a proper estimate of its effects can be formed.22. We found it necessary to carry our examination of the general principles of a block grant system up to this point in order to satisfy ourselves that the interim Education grants, which we are about to recommend, would not impede the ultimate adoption of such a system; and, unless His Majesty&apos;s Government consider that the institution of a general grant such as we have described would be politically impracticable, we propose to continue our exploration of this suggestion.
(B.) Education Grants, 1927/28/29.23: We turn now to consider Education grants for 1927 and the next two years.24. At the outset we are confronted by the question referred to in paragraph 9. How far the Government is, by its acceptance of the Burnham arbitration award, committed not to depart from the existing grant system during the currency of the award.25. Lord Burnham&apos;s arbitration awards were formally adopted by the Standing Joint Committees of Local Education Authorities and teachers on the 27th March, 1925, when they passed a resolution, of which the following is an extract : &quot;that the Standing Joint Committees on Teachers&apos; Salaries (Elementary, Secondary and Technical) accept and adopt the arbitral Awards of Lord Burnham, and agree to forward them to the President of the Board of Education as the agreed Reports of the respective Standing Joint Committees, subject to the payments of grant by the Board being continued on a basis not less than that now in force&apos;. . . .In communicating to Lord Burnham, on the 9th April, 1925, the Governments decisions as to the Awards, the President wrote : &quot; I am authorised by His Majesty&apos;s Government to inform you that the Board of Education will be prepared to recognise for grant purposes expenditure incurred by Local Authorities in paying salaries on the scales thus awarded by you.&quot;This letter was printed and published officially, together with Lord Burnham&apos;s award itself. The award declared the duration of the scales to be for six years from the 31st March, 1925, &quot; and thereafter from year to year, subject to notice of one year, being the financial year, from either panel of the Standing Joint Committee.&quot;On the 10th December, 1925, Mr. Trevelyan asked the President of the Board of Education in the House pf Commons whether the Standing Joint Committees on teachers&apos; salaries, in accepting and adopting the Burnham award, informed him that they did so subject to the payments of grant by the Board being continued on a basis not less than then in force, and wdiether he then made any comment on that proviso; and Lord Eustace Percy&apos;s reply contained the following passage : &quot; It has, so far as I know, never been claimed that anything said or done in connection writh the arbitration proceedings could commit the Government or Parliament in the slightest degree to the continuance of a particular grant formula, or grant system, nor could I for a moment admit such a claim if it were made; but I have every intention of making such grants to Authorities as will enable them to continue the payment of the allocated scales, and I have already made it clear that such payment will constitute a condition of grant.&quot;The Board of Education Circular of the 25th November, 1925 (Circular 1371), which had no doubt given rise to Mr. Trevelyan&apos;s question, had announced that a block grant would be fixed for each Authorit;^ cn the basis set out in the Appendix thereto, which, as regards Elementary Education, was to be &quot; A sum equal to the grant payable for 192^/25 on Elementary Education, less 1 per cent. This sum (it was stated) Avill be sufficient to provide in general for the payment of grant at the usual percentage on the salaries payable under the Burnham Award for the number of teachers employed on the 31st March, 1925, and the Board wall make special provision to meet the case of areas where the adoption of the Burnham Scales since that date entails an increase in the cost of salaries.&quot;This sum was to be reduced by 30s. for each child on the register on the 31st March, 1925, under the age of 5 years.The out-turn of Local Education Authorities&apos; expenditure for 1924/25 and the Local Education Authorities&apos; revised Estimates for 1925/26 showed that there had been a greater expansion of expenditure than would correspond to the amount of grant proposed in Circular 1371.[14863] b 3
It was found necessary to withdraw the Circular, and the grants for 1926 were fixed on the basis of the existing grant system. On the 4th March, 1926, Mr. Trevelyan asked the President of the Board whether he had received a resolution, passed unanimously on the 19th February by the Authorities&apos; Panel of the Burnham Standing Joint Committee, reminding him that the participation of the local authorities in the Burnham Award was expressly conditional upon no alteration being made in the present grant system to the prejudice of the Authorities; and whether he proposed to give the definite assurance asked for in the resolution that the grant system would not be altered to the prejudice of the Local Education Authorities, and Lord Eustace Percy replied : &quot; I have received the Resolution referred to. I appreciate the conditional nature of the agreement upon which the Burnham Scales are based, and tha maintenance of those Scales is a prime object of my policy, as is shown by the Regulation which I have recently issued. I do not think I can usefully say more at this moment, but the matter will, of course, not be overlooked in the discussions which are now taking place with Local Authorities in regard to the grant system;&quot;and in reply to a similar question on the 11th March he stated that he was sending to each of the Authorities&apos; Associations a communication indicating his reasons for taking the action which he had taken and his belief that the reforms in the present grant system, which he felt to be necessary and which he was then discussing with Authorities, would not have the effect which appeared to be apprehended in the Resolution.   The Circular contained the following passage : &quot; As the President understands it, the Authorities were not concerned to maintain the technical integrity of a particular grant formula or set of grant regulations; they were concerned to reserve their freedom of action in the event of any change in the Board&apos;s policy which would have the effect of transferring from taxes to rates a substantial part of the burden of expenditure necessarily entailed by the discharge of their statutory duties. The President does not believe that the reforms in the present grant system which he feels to be necessary and which he is now discussing with Authorities will have this effect, or that, when the B&apos;oard&apos;s proposals are formulated as the result of these discussions, the Authorities will desire to claim that they render inoperative the agreement of 1925.26. To some extent, therefore, the answer to the question set out in para-graph 24 is a matter of opinion. The Government could, without infringing the letter of the pledge to Lord Burnham, reduce the grant in respect of teachers&apos; salaries, say, from 60 to 50 per cent., provided they recognised for grant purposes the expenditure incurred by local authorities in paying salaries on the Burnham scales. Recognition for this purpose is a term of art. It means that the Board would be bound not to rule out of the expenditure of the local authority on which Education grants are calculated charges in respect of salaries of teachers on the establishment paid on the Burnham scales. On the other hand, local authorities would certainly claim that a reduction in the rate of grant on teachers&apos; salaries, if it did not infringe the letter of the pledge to Lord Burnham, did infringe its spirit, and if the reduction were drastic it wTould be difficult to rebut such a claim.27. We understand that the Local Education Authorities interpret their stipulation rigidly in the sense that they would regard themselves as being absolved from their part in the Burnham settlement if a grant system were adopted under which they received a smaller proportion of grant on their expenditure than the proportion to which they were entitled at the time when the settlement was reached. Even, therefore, if the same, or, indeed, a larger total of Exchequer grants were distributed by a different system, any local authority which, under the new system, received a smaller proportion of its total expenditure than under the system now in force, might claim that the action of the Government absolved it from observing the Burnham scales. The difficulty is primarily a Parliamentary and political one, but we have assumed, in devising an interim scheme of grant, that it would be politic to avoid the difficulty which an alteration in that part of the grant which represents the percentage of teachers&apos; salaries would involve.
28. If this is the view held by the Government, it would appear that it is not yet practicable to recommend a total departure from the expenditure basis and that, in fact, expenditure on teachers&apos; salaries must continue for the present to form an element of Education grants.29. Teachers&apos; salaries represent about 70 per cent, of the whole expenditure on education, and that part of the elementary education grant is calculated as 60 per cent, of teachers&apos; salaries in public elementary schools and 50 per cent, of teachers&apos; salaries in special schools. The other factors which are taken into account in the present grant in respect of elementary education operate to reduce in some directions and to increase in others the percentage which the Exchequer grant bears to local education expenditure taken as a whole, and, therefore, of teachers&apos; salaries. One method of dealing with the effect of these variables would be to treat each local authority as having its own appropriate percentage of teachers&apos; salaries, which, as a rule, would be something less than 60 per cent. the average Exchequer grant in 1923/25 was 55 per cent., and the percentage varied from 50 to 72.We believe on the whole, however, that it would be more satisfactory to pay Exchequer grants in respect of Teachers&apos; salaries on a uniform basis for all local authorities, whether this basis be that at present obtaining or some other basis.30. We should, in fact, prefer, if it were politically possible, that the percentage of Elementary School Teachers&apos; salaries should be fixed throughout at 50 per cent., the difference between 60 per cent, and 50 per cent, being treated in the same manner as Exchequer grants for education other than Teachers&apos; salaries, as set out in the succeeding paragraphs.31. On the 1924/25 figures the Government grant, in respect of the salaries of Elementary School Teachers (at 60 per cent.) and Special Teachers (at 50 per cent.) was  24,910,000, and in respect of the salaries of Higher Education Teachers  2,907,000-a total of  27,817,000. For 1925/26, on the information at present available, the corresponding figures are estimated to be, Elementary  24,925,000, Higher  3,025,000.   Total  27,950,000.32. To this extent, during the interim period, the Education grant would remain a percentage grant; but if this course were adopted, the Board of Education would, of course, continue the scrutiny which they are at present engaged in applying to the teaching establishments of schools on an examination of the programmes submitted by local authorities.33. In respect, however, of expenditure other than on salaries, the principle might now be laid down that no further increase of expenditure on the part of Local Education Authorities shall attract expenditure grant. All the existing Exchequer grants other than the percentages of Teachers&apos; salaries, would, under this plan, be convertible into block grants upon a new basis.34. The amount to be distributed upon this basis should, we suggest, be determined by deducting from the total Exchequer grants for Education, 1925/26, the sum included therein as a percentage of Teachers&apos; salaries; the remainder, which, on present information, may be estimated at  9,734,000/*&apos; should, subject to various necessary adjustments in respect, e.g., of Training College Super Grant, be stabilised for three years, and regarded as the total available for distribution as a block grant.If our suggestion for fixing the percentage grant of Elementary School Teachers&apos; salaries at 50 per cent, be adopted, the difference between 60 per cent, and 50 per cent, would be included in the Block grant and stabilised for the 3-year period. On this basis the amount so stabilised would be  13,847,000.35. It is to be anticipated that, if this course were adopted, Education Authorities would object that the whole cost (other than salaries) of Educational developments was thrown upon local rates and that the general body of taxpayers was escaping all contribution to the cost of new developments subsequent to 1925/26, such as the provision of new places, the replacement of &quot;black-listed &quot; schools, &amp;c. Having regard to the declared educational policy of the Government, we believe that such objections would be difficult to meet, and that it would be necessary to provide additional funds for development.This figure and those contained in the following paragraphs include the Residue Grant of  807,000.
This addition would be fixed at such an amount as the Chancellor of the Exchequer on a review of the financial position as a whole would feel able to afford As the percentage grant on teachers&apos; salaries would be applicable to the teaching expenditure of new schools, the sum available for other purposes would, pro tcmto be reduced.86. The principles on which the block grant, stabilised at, say,  9,734,000 or  13,847,000, as the case may be, for three years, together with any additional funds which may be found for development, should be distributed have given us much difficulty. If it were possible to ignore the existing distribution of education grants, we believe that it would be possible to evolve a basis which would generally be accepted as equitable. In practice, however, those authorities who would receive much less under the new basis&apos; than under the existing grants would certainly protest. To some extent the prospect of freedom from central control in regard to all expenditure other than teachers&apos; salaries would be likely to attract local authorities in favour of a block grant scheme, and we suggest that the Board of Education should be empowered to negotiate with local authorities the basis of a grant within the total indicated. In the last resort the block grant might represent the actual sum paid in respect of 1923/26 to each authority otherwise than as a salary rjercentage [plus 10 per cent, of Elementary School Teachers&apos; Salaries], together with a further sum towards the cost of any approved scheme of develojoment. But, as an alternative, we recommend that the sum be fixed as a grant per child in average attendance, which should vary on e. sliding scale based on the produce in each area of a rate in the   per child.One such formula which we have considered is, say, 20s. per child in average attendance divided by the produce (in  s) of a 5d. rate per child. The advantage of this particular formula is that it gives weight to two of the main considerations which affect the rate burden, viz., the number of children to be educated and the poverty or wrealth of the area. But there are no doubt an almost infinite number of variants which could be adopted.37.&quot; Should it be found practicable to redistribute the grants upon a new basis it would be desirable to keep in hand a substantial part of the sum available in order to deal with cases.of exceptionally heavy reduction of grant.38. London, for example, is an area with exceptionally high rateable value and with exceptionally high expenditure. Any basis of grant which ignores expendi-ture and gives special consideration to low rateable value is certain to reduce the London grant. We accordingly suggest that the block grant might be calculated on a basis which would absorb only a portion of the  9,734,000 or the  13,847,000 and leave a margin over.Under Section 118 of the Education Act, 1921 (which repeats a provision of the Act of 1918), local Education authorities are entitled to receive grants amounting to not less than 50 per cent, of approved expenditure, and forty-nine authorities receive under this section the grant known as Deficiency Grant in respect of Elementary Education. Higher Education grants are, in fact, fixed by regulation at the statutory minimum of 50 per cent, of approved net expenditure after making allowance for Local Taxation Grants and receipts from fees for all authorities.So long as this provision remains unrepealed, it will be impossible to establish a basis of Education Grants genuinely independent of expenditure, and we recommend that legislation be introduced repealing the section.39. We have anxiously considered whether the above proposals for continuing for the time being percentage grants in respect of salary expenditure would prejudice 1 the ultimate adoption of a block grant system which would cover salaries also, ft is hard to be confident on this point; it may be that the disentanglement of the salary percentage grant from the present&quot; formula may strengthen the position of teachers on salary questions. On the other hand, we hope that local authorities will find convenience in the block grant and will welcome its extension. We have made it clear that we have only recommended the temporary continuance of the Percentage grant for salaries because of the Governments commitments (howrever they may be inter-preted) and of the stipulations of local authorities on the acceptance of the Burnham awrard.40. The block grant which we think can for the present be instituted will amount approximately either to  9,734,000 or to  13,847,000, representing respectively 26 per cent, or 37 per cent, of Exchequer Grants for Education,
Reservation by Mr. 67. Macdonald and Mr. John Jeffrey.In signing this Report, we desire to make the following reservations regarding the suggested Interim Scheme : 1. The proposal to disentangle teachers&apos; salaries from the existing formula and to pay a &quot; Salary Grant,&quot; to be reckoned as a simple percentage of salary expendi-ture, appears to us to be a retrograde step, calculated to prejudice future policy most seriously. On the present figures it means that as much as  24,762,000, or 76-7 per cent., of the total Grant of  32,289,120 for Elementary Education will for the first time be placed definitely on a percentage basis, uncorrected by the elements in the existing formula which make for rate-equalisation. Those elements, which are the soundest factors in the current method of distribution, will, in fact, disappear com-pletely, being submerged in the Block Grant, which is to be a stereotyped amount.2. L.E.As. and, still more, teachers will welcome such a &quot;Salary Grant&quot; as likely to tighten the hold which they already have on the Exchequer. Once instituted, it will be extremely hard to get away from. We believe, therefore, that it would be much wiser, not to say more logical, to leave the existing formula intact, so far as the salary element is concerned, and to disentangle from it only those per-centages of expenditure which it is proposed to stereotype as the nucleus of the Block Grant. Financially, this would make no difference to the L.E.As. So far as principle is concerned, it would make a great difference to the Government by leaving their hands free.3. We regard it as essential that any new money that can be provided for development should be added to the Block Grant and &apos;&apos; distributed on the approved basis, taking into account the general characteristics of the respective areas.&quot; So Jong as L.E.As. enjoy a statutory guarantee of a minimum of-50 per cent, of their expenditure, any new grant &quot; to be fixed on some unit basis applicable to the Service, e.g., so much per new place,&quot; would ultimately resolve itself into an additional per-centage grant. London and other &quot;deficiency&quot; areas would have a statutory right to 50 per cent, of the cost of the selected unit. And the percentage that was being given to the rich could not in equity be denied to the poor.GEO. MACDONALD. JOHN JEFFREY.* Subject to reservation.apart from any additional funds which may be provided for development. The introduction of the new basis of grant will be greatly facilitated by the voluntary acceptance of Local Education Authorities.
