This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.Printed for the Cabinet, July, 1926.SECRET.CP. 284 (26).THE CABINET.PROPOSED PURCHASE OF LAND BY THE WAR OFFICE.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.1. Salisbuky Plain.Owing to the development of artillery weapons there are at the present time no     138 artillery ranges which satisfy modern requirements except to a limited extent at Larkhill. Southern The other ranges, besides being too short, are, for the most part in hilly districts where it.is     20a almost impossible to practice the manoeuvre of guns.   The minimum ranges (in yards) considered necessary for efficient practice are : 	Manoeuvre extreme.		Safety allowance.		Depth.	Range.	Range.	Lateral.Light guns and howitzers	3,000	9,500	1,000	1,000Medium howitzers	3,000	10,000	2,000	1,500Medium guns	3,000	15,000	2,000	1,500Heavy howitzers        ...      ...		12,000	2,000	2,500Heavy guns		20,000	2,000	1,500The existing artillery ranges, together with the greatest range at which a field gun can fire with safety at each of them, utilizing to the full the ground available, are as follows : yards. yards.Larkhill       .........    9,000       Trawsfynydd       ...... 7,000West Down.........    7,500      Redesdale......... 9,500Okehampton.........    6,000       Buddon    ......... 5,500These are maximum ranges obtainable only from one position, firing in one direction, and in some cases the value is discounted by the fact that the nature of the ground makes observation to the full extent impossible. All six ranges are used for light and medium artillery, but only the Salisbury Plain ranges are at all satisfactory for medium artillery, and even then the guns are limited to shooting entirely with reduced charges. Heavy howitzers can fire on the Larkhill range only, and heavy guns cannot fire on any existing land range.Also the congestion on the ranges is now acute. The number of artillery units which have to carry out practice has increased since pre-war days, while the number of ranges has been reduced by the loss of Glen Imaal in Ireland. It is only by keeping the camps open until towards the end of September (which renders a large area on Salisbury Plain unavailable for combined tactical training) that practice can be arranged for a limited number of units. Regular Heavy Brigades can shoot every alternate year only ; Terri-torial Heavy Brigades cannot shoot on land ranges at all ; only 40 out of 71 Territorial Army Field Artillery Brigades can practice each year.(b36/17)   100   7/26   w.o.p.   3757Copt.

Further, it is.vital to the training of the army that artillery ranges should contain landing facilities for aeroplanes, but at present it is drily at Larkhill, and to a limited extent at Okehampton, that such facilities exist, so that each year half the Regular batteries and nearly all the Territorial batteries are quite untrained in air co-operation.Finally; it is necessary to deal with the situation caused by the decision to evacuate in the course of the next few years the Tank gunnery training camp at Lulworth, which has made it essential to look - elsewhere for a site suitable for a permanent Tank gunnery range.After a prolonged search it has been found that the only area of ground which at all satisfies requirements is immediately to the west of, and contiguous with, the present War Department ground at Larkhill on Salisbury Plain. It possesses unique advantages as an artillery range and it would provide a range for Tank gunnery in place of Lulworth. The total cost of purchase is estimated at  834,000 and capital expenditure in the neighbourhood of  20,000 will be involved in making the new ranges available for use.The land is chiefly used for agricultural purposes (mainly sheep-farming), but a considerable portion has an enhanced value due to its adaptability for gallops used in connection with training establishment in the neighbourhood. It will, of course, be necessary to impose somewhat stringent conditions on the civilian use of the land, but it is considered that the disturbance of civilian interests will not be greater in this instance than it would in the case of a possible alternative and the price; which works out at an average of less than  26 an acre, compares favourably with that of any equivalent area of suitable land that could be selected.As a set-off to this expenditure there are the following estimated credits and savings : - Sale value of the range at Trawafynydd no longer required ..;   20;000 Saving of expenditure on the Trawsfynydd range    ...       .;.   lo^OuOSaving  of   cost  of   purchasing   Lulworth   (less  cost   ofreinstatement)        ...       ...       ...       ...       ...       ...     5,000Revenue from new estate        ...       ....   ..... not less than     8,000 a yearSaving on transport to new range instead of Trawsfynydd ...        500 a yearA decision is urgently required, as the Lulworth property now occupied by the Tank gunnery training camp must be handed over, properly re-instated, by August, 1929, and must consequently be evacuated probably not later than January, .1929. Within the next three years, therefore, it is necessary to provide not only an adequate range for Tank gunnery but also suitable buildings to house the personnel now at Lulworth, and the location of their future home must be settled without delay.The area (shown on the Map A attached) consists of approximately 32,400 acres.2. Aldekshot.43 In the Aldershot Command also; a problem has arisen for which it is imperative thatTraining a solution be found without delay, owing to recent encroachments upon the area of 378     undeveloped and open spaces in the vicinity of Bordon and Frensham, hitherto available for the training of troops.The total area of War Department land in the Command, excluding certain detached depots, is about 26,000 acres. Of this; 7,500 acres are occupied by barracks and various establishments and about 6;500 acres, which are continuously in use as rifle ranges during the summer, are not available for training during that part of the year. The value for training purposes of the remainder (12,000 acres) is greatly diminished by reason of its division - into detached areas. In order, therefore, to obtain adequate facilities for manoeuvre, the local military authorities have had to rely on the goodwill of local landowners who may be prepared to allow access to their property.Difficulties were encountered, even before the war, in obtaining sufficient land for training ; these difficulties have heen greatly increased since the war owing, chiefly, to the development of land for building purposes, to the increased value of shooting rights, and to the activities of the Forestry Commission. Building operations are tending to isolate the commons over which training is still allowed, and for reasons connected with the sporting rights; large areas in the neighbourhood of Bordon hitherto available are now closed to the troops.   The operations of the Forestry Commission are incompatible with
The War Office,23r^ July, 1926.the use of the land by troops, and the afforestation of the Kettlebury Hill area has deprived the Army of the use of 350 acres and has incidentally made practically useless for training purposes the adjacent commons of Hankley and Thursley.The process of curtailment will undoubtedly continue, if not arrested, and the time has come when action cannot be longer delayed. I therefore propose that the War Department should acquire (a) The interests of, and the leases held by the Forestry Commission near Frensham,covering an area of about 1,000 acres ;(b) The interests of the Lords of the Manor in some 4,419 acres of common landsin the Bordon and Frensham areas ;(c) The freehold of certain lands comprising some 1,220 acres in the Bordon andFrensham areas ;at a total estimated cost of  75,000.The areas are shown on Map B attached.L.
