(Por First Report see C8P0224(26 )).1, In accordance with the request of the Oabinet  (Cabinet37(26) Conclusion 7), the &quot;Committee have examined Reports 2,4,5,6 and 7 of the Inter-Departmental Committee on Questions affecting Inter-Imperial Relations.      Copies of these five Reports are appended hereto.      It will be observed that the Reports have been drafted for the exclusive use of the British Representatives at the Imperial Conference, and that it is of the greatest importance that they should not be communicated to the Dominion Representatives.      In so far as it may be found necessary or desirable after the Conference opens to supply the Dominion Representatives with memoranda dealing with the questions raised in these Reports, special documents based in each case on the approved policy will be prepared for circulation to and consideration by the Conference.    Arrangements! will also be made for the preparation of draft Resolutions for submission to the Conference at the appropriate time.2. After careful consideration of the annexed Reports,the Committee recommend the Cabinet to approve the. various proposals of the Inter Departmental Committee,  subject to the amendments and qualifications suggested in the following paragraphs.      On one question (see para. 5   ) the Committee have failed to reaoh agreement,  and the issue is accordingly submitted to the Cabinet for determination.

So long as it reoelves no adverse comments, and so long as its polioy involves no active obligations onthe part of the other Governments, it may act on the assumption that it is at liberty to proceed with its polioy.     It must, hov/ever, before taking any steps which would involve the  other Governments in any active obligations,  obtain their definite assent&quot;.4. The Committee entirely concur with the proposalsoontained in Para.6 of ECS) 13 designed to bring DominionGovernments into closer personal touch with the conductof foreign affairs by His Majesty^ Government.     Theseprimarilyproposals it will be observed involve/the appointment as representatives in London of persons possessing toe politicalconfidence of their Governments and the necessaryqualiiicati ons, and with the right of direct access to, theForeign Secretary to discuss the urgent questions of thehour and the development of events as they occur.&apos;    The Committee laid the greatest stress on this proposal whichthey regard as of capital importance.
jhc Committee feel, however, conBid.orr.blo doubt as to the further procedure (indicated in Parac7) which has been suggested in certain quarters, namely, that by agreement with a Dominion Government a r-;.;,resent at ivo of His MajcstyTs Govern-ment should be appointed to reside in that Dominion with a standing similar to that of the Dominion High Commissioners in London.    As matters stand at present the adoption of this proposal would involve a certain overlapping with the functions and responsibilities of the Governor General and in the Committee &quot;s opinion it would be premature for the question  to &quot;be considered at the forthcoming Imperial Conference.5.        In Para.12 of E.(B) 13 it is suggested inter alia that subsidiary conferences of a general character for the dis-cussion of questions of foreign affairs (other than those likely to be raised at the Meeting of the Assembly of the League of Mations), and of any outstanding economic questions,, should take place annually in October.    The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs is strongly of opinion that the Imperial Conference should meet annually and that while &quot;full&quot; meetings attended by Prime Ministers should,  as a rule, be held every three years, the other annual meetings of the Conference might be attended by Ministers of lesser importance or by the Dominion representatives in London to be appointed under Para.6, and might on occasion take place in the Dominions.    On the other hand it has been pointed out that the policy of annual meetings of tho Imperial Conference is difficult to reconcile with the policy of close consultation with responsible Dominion representatives advocated in Para.6.      That certain Dominions might make the annual conference policy an excuse for not appointing representatives in London;    that it is improbable that the Dominions would acquiesce in the discussion of issues of major importance at conferences not attended by their PrimeMinisters;    and
...... 457that it would he almost impossible for- British Cabinet Ministers to spare time to attend annual conferences in the Dominions.In view of this division of opinion, the Committoe submit       the question raised In Para.12, Sub Para.3 of B.(B) 13 to the Cabinet for decision.6.        With reference to the suggestion contained in Para.13 that It may be advisable to create a Secretariat of the Imperial Conference of a permanent character on the analogy of the Secretariat of the League of Nations, tho Committee consider that if the Dominion representatives are in favour of a Standing Permanent Secretariat, the British Government should indioate their willingness to give the establishment of suoh a Secretariat favourable consideration.      In the event of suoh a Secretariat being formed, the Secretariats of any Inter-Imperial Committees now in existenoe, such as the Imperial Shipping Committee and the Imperial Economic Committee, would naturally be staffed from the Permanent Standing Secretariat of the Imperial Conference.Subject to these observations the Committe-e concur generally with the proposals in (a),  fb) and (c) o  Para.13 on the understanding that in the case of an Inter-Imperial Committee under (b) an English Secretary will always&apos; be associated with a Dominion Secretary.7. REPORT NO.4 Off THE REPRESENTATION OP THE BRITISHEMPIRE AT INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCES.   fE.(B) 14.V &quot; &apos; &apos;   &quot; * 11 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 &apos; &apos; 1........      1       r        .....        ...........The Committee     agree     with the views expressedpoliticalin Para.11 of E.(Bj 14 that in the case of/conferences of the fcind in question,, the most satisfactory solution would be to secure, the adoption of the logical procedure, namely,
that only one invitation should bo issued by the foreign -Government convoking the Conference,  inviting the appointment by His Britannic Majesty of plenipotentiaries to take part in the Conference.    If, however, as is unhappily unlikely, the acquiescence of tho Dominions in this logical procedure cannot be obtained^ the Committee agree that it will be necessary to fall back upon the polioy of endeavouring to secure from foreign Governments separate Invitations to the Governments of Great Britain and the Dominions, or alternatively (and in the opinion of the Committee, preferably) a single invitation mentioning nomlnatim the various parts of tha Empire concerned.    It is for the British Empire to determine how many of its Governments should be represented as part of the joint representation of the Empire and it is accordingly in the Committee&apos;s view most desirable to establish the principle that the representation of the Empire at those Conferences is a matter on which the -Empire alone can decide and to insist on foreign powers recog-recognising the right of the Dominions to participate in Coixf erences on questions in which they are interested.The Committee also concur in the view that it is in any case very important to secure that the invitations and replies to them should be transmitted through the diplomatic channel,and that whatever the form of tho invitation for such a conference may be, the Governments of the Empire represented should co-operate as a single British Empire Delegation.The Committee adopt the view of the Inter-^Departiuental Committee in Para. 15 that in the case of Technical   Conferences, endeavours should be made wherever possible to persuade foreign Governments to issue invitations to the Dominions to send separate Delegations.    The invitations to be sent and answered through the diploma lie channel.
o     iSPORT HO.5 Oil THE POSITION OF THE REPRESENTATIVE OF     4.3*? &apos;   &apos;    THE BRITISH EMPIRE 01: THE COUNCIL OF THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS  (E (B)  15).The Committee attach the greatest value to the maintenance of the present practice during meetings of the Assembly of keeping the Dominion representatives fully informed, by meetings with the British Empire representative, of all that takes place at Council meetings.      In the opinion of the Committee any arrangement which involved the abandonment of this practice would be wholly unacceptable to the British Government-.The Committee concur generally with the proposals contained in Paragraph 18 of E (B) 15, and the:/ desire in particular to emphasise the importance of giving effect y/he never possible to the arrangement suggested in the concluding sentence of that paragraph, namely that, if at a Council meeting of the League of Nations any question arises which is of greater interest to the Dominion Government than to the Government in London, a representative of the Dominion concerned should take the place of the representative of the Government in London during the discussion of that question, arid should sit as the British Empire representative.9.    REPORT NO.6 Oil QUESTIONS ARISING FROM COMMERCIAL TREATIES  (E  (3)  16).The Committee entirely concur with therecommendations contained in Paragraphs 9 to 12 and 15 ofE (B) 16, respecting the policy to be adopted by His Hajesty&apos;sGovernment at the Imperial Conference on certain questions arising from Commercial Treaties.10. REPORT NO.7 ON THE QUESTION OF ALTERING THE TITLE &quot;HIS MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT&quot; AS A DESCRIPTION OF HIS MAJESTY&apos;S MINISTERS III LONDON RESPONSIBLE TO THE IMPERIAL PARLIAMENT, AND OTHER QUESTIONS  (E  (B)  17).The Cabinet will observe that the Inter-DepartmentalCommittee suggest that where it is necessary to make it plain
that the London Government is speaking only as ihe Governmentwhich represents those parts of the Jiimpire whidh are notseparate members of the League of Nations as distinct from theGovernments of the Dominions, the expression &quot;Sis majesty&apos;s government in Great Britain&quot; should be adopted in preference tothe alternative expressions, indioated in paragraph 2 of (B) 17.     Tho Committee would acoept with reluctance thenecessity for the discontinuance even to this limited extentof tha expression &quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government&quot; to denote HisMajesty&apos;s Government in London, but In that event concur withthe Inter-Departmental Committee in thinking that the expression.!&quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain&quot; is preferable toother suggested expressions.On the question of the diplomatic representation of theDominions in foreign countries, the Inter-DepartmentalCommittee observe in Paragraph 8 of 3 (B) 17:&quot;   While the Dominions may press for separate diplomatic representation of their interests in special cases, a preferable alternative, where it is possible, in such cases would be that His Majesty&apos;s Representatives abroad should have at their disposal a member of their staff in a position to assist them in promoting the special interests of a Dominion in the country in which : they reside.&quot;The Committee are of opinion that the British Representatives should not initiate any discussion on this subject at the Imperial Conference.    If,  however, the question is raised by the Dominions the British Representatives should indicate that the policy outlined above is one the adoption of which the British Government would welcome, at the same time intimating that if separate Dominion diplomatic representation is^&amp;^ssjgd-ed. evory possible assistance will be given, to the Dominion Minister concerned by His Kajesty&apos;s Representative.Signed on behalf of the Committee SALISBURY.Chairman.Wpehall Gardens, S.W.1, ^Oth July, lg86
[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.1Printed for the Imperial Conference.   July 1926.SECRET. ^ Copy No.    7----- For the use of British Representatives only.E (B) 13. Not circulated to the Dominions.CABINET.Imperial Conference, 1926.REPORT No. 3 OF COMMITTEE ON QUESTIONS AFFECTING &quot;    INTER-IMPERIAL RELATIONS.The system of communication and consultation between the Governments of the Empire on matters of common interest, including the organisation of the Imperial Conference itself, its machinery and the methdd of fixing its meetings.THE present system of communication and consultation with the Dominions is . described in Appendix A.Special attention should be called to one point in connection with the existing system, namely, the procedure by way of direct messages between Prime Ministers introduced as a result of the Imperial War Cabinet of 1918. This is much valued in the Dominions, and indeed is now established as a channel of formal consultation in matters of first-class importance. It was announced in Parliament in 1925, on the creation of the post of Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, that it was not proposed to alter this procedure, which &apos;&apos; ensures that the subject concerned is not merely dealt with departmentally, but does come directly under the Prime Ministers personal cognizance.&quot;*2. No special problem arises for the moment as to the system of communication and consultation with the Dominions on matters of Imperial, as opposed to international, interest.The Dominion High Commissioners in London are kept in touch with all important developments in Imperial affairs, both by correspondence and also by means of their weekly meetings with the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.3.   The main difficulties which have arisen in recent years concern the system of communication and consultation on foreign affairs.The problem arising in this connection is how to reconcile the principles of self-government in external, as well as domestic, affairs with the necessity for a policy in foreign affairs of general Imperial concern which will commend itself to a number of different Governments and Parliaments.4. The present machinery, while satisfactory as to communication of informa-tion to the Dominions, is less satisfactory as to communication of information from the Dominions. As regards consultation it is inadequate; and the inadequacy of the present system is the more marked in regard to matters of major importance in relation to foreign affairs, in which as a rule expedition is essential and urgent decision is necessary.5.   His Majesty&apos;s Government should in any case endeavour to secure a general agreement on the following lines n Any Government engaged in negotiations affecting foreign relations falling within its sphere must keep the other Governments likely to be interested fully informed of what it is doing. So long as it receives no adverse comments, and so long as its policy involves no active obligations on the part of the other Governments, it may proceed on the assumption that its policy is generally acceptable. It must, however, before taking any steps which would involve the other Governments in any active obligations, obtain their definite assent.&quot;6. Three special aspects of the general question were mentioned in the Report of the Imperial Conference (Agenda) Committee (CP. 124 (26)) :(a.) The extent to tohich it may be possible to bring the Dominion Governments into closer personal touch with the conduct of foreign Affairs by His Majesty&apos;s* Speech of the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs of the 27th July, 1925 (&quot; Hansard,&quot; 1924-25, vol. 187, column 09).3483-1   [14704]   [14779] b
Government. Some improved procedure should be worked out with a view to securing closer personal touch with the Dominions in the intervals between Imperial Conferences on current questions of foreign policy. Despatches are too slow. Telegrams alone do not offer facilities for argument. Some form of personal contact is wanted. Under the present system there is no means whereby the Foreign Secretary can readily ascertain the Dominion point of view by personal discussion with Dominion representatives, except in so far as special arrangements have been attempted or made for dealing with some particular problem; these so far have usually been limited to the preparations for and work of International Conferences including under this heading meetings of the Council and Assembly of the League of Nations. The same remark applies to the members of the staff of the Foreign Office. bA beginning was made towards continuous personal contact at the end of 1924 by the appointment in London by the Commonwealth Government of a personal representative of the Prime Minister, Major Casey. Commenting on this appoint-ment in the House of Commons on the 27th July, 1925, Mr. Amery stated : &quot; I would say that valuable as this fuller and more individual information may be to a Dominion Government in the case of a relatively junior official like the one whom Australia has appointed, we should be equally willing to extend the same principle, if desired, to more senior and authoritative representatives, be they High Commissioners or any other representatives whom each Dominion Government may care to appoint whomever they wish to depute for that purpose -not only for the purpose of securing first-hand information for their Government, but also for the purpose of confidential consultation with the British Government on any matters on which their Government might wish to be advised or might wish to have discussed.&quot;The Committee consider that a system on these lines would assist materially towards the solution of the present difficulties. It would, in order to be effective, involve the appointment as representatives in London of persons possessing the political confidence of their Governments and the necessary qualifications, and with the right of direct access to the Foreign Secretary to discuss the urgent questions of the hour and the developments of events as they occur. But some Dominion Governments may not be prepared to take this step, and experience has shown that great caution would be required in approaching certain of the Dominion Govern-ments with a suggestion of this kind, particularly those of Canada and the Union of South Africa. In any case, trained officials would be needed to assist any representative appointed. The appointment of such officials is so desirable that the Committee feel that every practicable effort should be made to indicate clearly to the Dominions that their appointment would be welcome to His Majesty&apos;s Government even in cases in which the Dominions are not prepared to appoint at once the representatives referred to above. The general system on which Major Casey works could then be taken as a model.7. There is a further procedure which has been suggested in some quarters, namely, that, presumably by agreement with a Dominion Government, a repre-sentative of His Majesty&apos;s Government should be appointed to reside in that Dominion with a standing similar to that of the Dominion High Commissioners in London. Should any such representative be in future appointed, he might be supplied with current information as to foreign relations and his services utilised inter alia to maintain contact with Dominion Ministers on matters affecting those relations. Any such arrangement would, however, in the opinion of the Committee, necessarily be supplementary to and not a substitute for the arrangements suggested in the preceding paragraph.8. Any developments in the directions indicated would necessitate the extension of the machinery at the Foreign Office to carry out the routine work of preparing information from the Foreign Office for the Dominions and of collecting information relating to the Dominions for the use of the Foreign Secretary. The detailed arrangements for this work and any consequential changes would need consideration.9. It should be pointed out that the Dominions generally in recent years have insisted that the assent of their Governments, and indeed in certain cases of their Parliaments, is essential before they are committed to any active obligations in the sphere of foreign relations.* Nevertheless it is hoped that closer personal touch will* See &quot; Summary of Proceedings of the Imperial Conference, 1923,&quot; p. 13.
so smooth the way to decisions as sensibly to ailb?t. the time within which such decisions can be reached. ^ .10. (b.) The extent to which it may be possible to improve the arrangements for the supply to His Majesty&apos;s Government of information with regard to such foreign relations as are dealt with by the Dominion Governments themselves. The present position is shown in Appendix A. It is now the practice to tell Governors-General personally on appointment of the wishes of His Majesty&apos;s Government in this respect, and it is suggested that opportunity should be taken at the forthcoming Imperial Conference to invite the Dominion Prime Ministers to co-operate more closely in conveying this information to His Majesty&apos;s Government. Should any of the suggestions referred to under (a) above be adopted, they would contribute to an improvement in the supply of information regarding the activities of the Dominion Governments in the sphere of foreign relations.11. (c.) The conditions on which secret am,d confidential documents which are the property of His Majesty&apos;s Government should be communicated to representatives of the Dominion Governments in London, whether or not those representatives are utilised as a medium of communication between their Governments and His Majesty&apos;s Government on the topics dealt with in these docu^ments. The present practice is indicated in Appendix E.The Committee consider that if any High Commissioners or other political representatives of the type indicated above, or if further trained assistants of the type of Major Casey, are appointed, the practice as regards the supply to them of all the more important documents of a secret and confidential nature affecting foreign relations should be modelled on that adopted in the case of Dominion Ministers attending Imperial Conferences.* For the security of any papers sent to them the recipients will be personally responsible.Organisation of the Imperial &quot;Conference itself, its Machinery., and the method of fixing its Meetings.12. The main difficulty in fixing the meetings of the Imperial Conference lies in securing a date which is convenient to the representatives of all the Governments concerned. In practice, it is found that what may be termed &quot; full &quot; meetings are only possible every two&apos;or three, sometimes even four, years.In order further to develop the process of &quot;continuous consultation,&quot; the importance of which was affirmed in Resolution IX of the Imperial War Conference of 1917, and reaffirmed by subsequent Conferences, an effort should be made to arrange a meeting every year before the annual meetings of the Assembly of the League. These meetings would be attended by the Delegates who are going to Geneva and should be confined to the consideration of questions of foreign affairs which are likely to be raised at Geneva, especially those connected with the work of the League of Nations.Subsidiary conferences of a general character for the discussion of other questions of foreign affairs and of any outstanding economic questions should also take place, and for these a suitable date would be October. The institution of such subsidiary conferences would have the further advantage that it would facilitate the holding of conferences occasionally in the Dominions. It might well be inconvenient for the Prime Minister of Great Britain to attend a &quot; full &quot; meeting of the Imperial Conference in a Dominion; and, further, so long as most of the expert advice on matters of foreign policy and defence and the relevant documents are in London, it would be difficult, except in special circumstances, as, for example, to consider problems of the Pacific at close quarters, to arrange for adequate discus-sion of these matters at Conferences elsewhere. But no such difficulty should arise in the case of subsidiary conferences which were concerned mainly with matters other than foreign relations and defence. There is a precedent for a conference of this kind in the Ottawa Conference of 1894.13. The Secretariat of the Imperial Conference is now composed of officials of all the Governments represented, who are appointed ad hoc, and the question is often raised whether it would not be advisable to create a Secretariat of a more permanent character on the analogy of the Secretariat of the League of Nations.* This practice is as follows : Copies of all Foreign Office prints and Foreign Office telegrams circulated to the Cabinet are sent to the Dominion Prime Ministers in boxes from the Cabinet Office to be returned after perusal. Copies of any Foreign Office prints or Committee of Imperial Defence papers which are specially to be considered by the Conference are circulated as Conference papers, not only to the Dominion Prime Ministers, but to other Dominion Ministers attending- the Conference for retention.[14704] b 2sssmh mm i
It seems, however, &quot;doubtful, whether all the Dominion Governments would be nrepjredjo. accent such a suggestion if made. It might be thought that the object of such a departure was to associate the Dominion Governments more closely than they would desire with the policy of the Government in London (where the head-quarters of the Secretariat would presumably be). Further, so far as foreign affairs are concerned, the object in view could in a large measure be obtained by adoption of the procedure described in paragraph 6.As regards matters other than foreign affairs, the Committee think that proposals on somewhat different lines might be preferable, such as-(a.) The appointment by the Dominion Governments of liaison officers in London dealing with economic matters. These might work on a similar system to that adopted in the case of Major Casey.(b.) The association of these or other Dominion representatives with the Secretariats of any inter-Imperial Committees now in existence (such as the Imperial Shipping Committee and the Imperial Economic Committee), or to be formed in future.(c.) The designation of selected officers in each Dominion who would correspond with officers of the Dominions Office on matters connected with (1) the carrying out in detail of the Resolutions of Imperial Conferences, and (2) the preparation of material for future Conferences.Proposal (c) could also be applied to matters relating to foreign affairs generally, in the case of any Dominion which had not appointed representatives or officials in London of the type described in paragraph 6.(Signed on behalf of the Committee),HUBERT MONTGOMERY,Chairman.Foreign Office, June 22, 1926.
The Present System of Communication and Consultation with the DominionGovernments.The Supply op Information to the Dominions.(1.) During the Intervals between Imperial Conferences. *THE main source of supply is to be found in communications by mail or telegram for the information either of the Dominion Governments or of the Dominion Prime Ministers. In some cases it is possible to supplement information so supplied by personal communication with Dominion representatives in London.Communications by Mail or Telegram for the Information of the Dominion Governments.Command Papers and other published documents dealing with such matters of common interest as foreign affairs, defence, oversea settlement, wireless communica-tions, economic policy and shipping questions are sent in official despatches from the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, addressed to the Governor-Genera] and described as being for the information of his Ministers. Any necessary explanatory comment is given in the despatch.Unpublished information is sent in a similar manner. In the case of foreign affairs this chiefly relates to diplomatic correspondence dealing either with matters of current administration, such as the negotiation of Treaties other than those of first class importance, or with action taken or contemplated by foreign Governments which may affect British interests generally (e.g., the recent Mexican Property Law, or claims by foreign countries as to the limits of territorial waters). As regards matters other than foreign affairs, the report of the Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence on Trading and Blockade and the Reports of the Technical Wireless Sub-Committee of the Imperial Communications Committee are examples.Where more expeditious notification is required, information which would otherwise have been given in such despatches is sent in official telegrams from the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs to the Governors-General.Communications by Mail or Telegram for the Information of the Dominion Prime Ministers.Important decisions of policy taken by His Majesty&apos;s Government on matters of common interest are notified by means of messages from the Prime Minister addressed to the Dominion Prime Ministers embodied in telegrams from the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs to the Governors-General. (In the case of the Irish Free State copies are sent by despatch.)Special arrangements also exist for keeping the Dominion Prime Ministers currently informed on foreign affairs.All confidential Foreign Office prints which are circulated to the Cabinet are sent weekly by mail. The number of such prints sent to the Dominions during 1925 was 576.Information on current aspects of foreign affairs is also sent by telegram, in cases where it is important that the Dominion Prime Ministers should be in posses-sion of information in advance of that obtainable by mail or in supplement to that appearing in the Press. These telegrams, based upon summaries prepared in the Foreign Office, are addressed to the Governor-General by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs and conclude with the words, &apos;&apos; Please inform your Prime Minister.&quot;  The number sent during 1925 was 190.Occasionally Committee of Imperial Defence papers of a secret character have&apos; been sent to the Dominion Prime Ministers under cover of a personal letter or note from the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, e.g., papers relating to the Geneva Protocol and papers on the diversion of British shipping in time of war and air raid precautions which had a bearing on the policy underlying the Treaty of Locarno.Personal Commmunication with Dominion Representatives.At present, the arrangements under this head are confined to matters other than foreign affairs and defence (e.g.., the weekly meetings between the Secretary of StateAPPENDIX A.
for Dominion Affairs and the High Commissioners) except in the case of Australia The Government of the Commonwealth of Australia at the end of 1924 appointed a special liaison officer in London to study all aspects of foreign affairs, and supply the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth with any information which he may require to supplement that sent out on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government. This officer has access to all communications to the Commonwealth referred to above, and also to other confidential papers, e.g., those relating to the work of the Committee of Imperial Defence. He is in touch with the officials of the Foreign Office and Dominions Office and supn^rrfents the communications referred to above as he thinks necessary.(2.) During Imperial Conferences.In addition to the information given to the Dominion Prime Ministers by state-ments at the Conference, they receive the Foreign Office prints which are circulated to the Cabinet, and the Foreign Office daily print of telegrams. The official communications by mail and telegram for the information of the Dominion Govern-ments referred to above are continued and copies are supplied to the Dominion Prime Ministers in London. The telegraphic communications addressed to the Prime Ministers referred to above are of course suspended, but the Foreign Office prints are sent out weekly for the Acting Prime Ministers, and any developments of special importance would be notified to them by telegraph.The Supply of Information from the Dominions.As regards published documents, it is the practice of the Dominion Governments to send to the Dominions Office copies of all Parliamentary Debates, Acts of Parlia-ment, Parliamentary papers, &amp;c, though these documents are sometimes received only after a considerable interval.As regards unpublished information, the supply is by no means complete, especially as regards foreign affairs. During the intervals between Imperial Conferences the main source of supply consists of despatches or telegrams from the Governor-General to the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs. The amount of information received in this manner depends partly on the personality of the Governor-General and his staff, and his relations with his Ministers, and partly on the general attitude of the Dominion Governments on international questions. In addition information is received, as regards trade matters, from His Majesty&apos;s Trade Commissioners in the Dominions, as regards migration questions in Australia from the Imperial Representative Mr. Bankes Amery, and occasionally, as regards foreign affairs, from His Majesty&apos;s representatives in foreign countries, e.g., it is not unusual to learn first of action taken by Canada in relation to the United States through a despatch to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs from the Embassy at Washington.During an Imperial Conference particulars are also obtained from statements by the Dominion Prime Ministers at the Conference, e.g., as regards foreign affairs, the statements made by Mr. Mackenzie King and General Smuts at the Imperial Conference of 1923.The System of Consultation.(1.) During the Intervals between Imperial Conferences.Personal Consultation.As regards major issues of foreign affairs, the only opportunity which at present exists for personal consultation is at or immediately before international conferences, at which Dominion delegates are present ie.g&apos;., the Washington Disarmament Conference of 1921-22, and meetings of the Assembly of the League of Nations). On such occasions close and constant touch is invariably maintained between the I Delegates of His Majesty&apos;s Government and those of the Dominion Governments.Meetings with the Dominion High Commissioners are occasionally held to consider other questions connected with foreign affairs (e.g., matters arising at the quarterly session of the Governing Body of the International Labour Office), but these are exceptional arrangements resulting from the special nature of the subject.As regards matters other than foreign affairs, personal consultation does not present the same difficulties. Visits from Dominion Ministers to London are not infrequent, and a system of visits of Ministers from London to the Dominions is
slowly being developed. One method frequently employed is the reference of particular problems to special inter-Imperial Committees (e.g., the Dominions Royal Commission, the Imperial Shipping Committee and the Imperial Economic Committee), including representatives of the Dominion Governments as well as of His Majesty&apos;s Government, or the association of Dominion representatives with. Departmental or Inter-Departmental Committees appointed by His Majesty&apos;s Government, e.g., the Advisory Committee on Imperial Wireless Services, and the Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence on the Reduction and Limitation of Armaments. The Pacific Cable Board, the Imperial War Graves Commission, the Imperial Institute and the Empire Marketing Board are examples of cases where personal consultation is brought to bear on problems of administration.Communications by Mail or Telegram between the Governments.As regards major issues of foreign policy, consultation by despatch or telegram presents considerable difficulty, and instances of it are rare, but there have been cases in connection with such questions as the proposed Treaty of Mutual Assistance (1924), the Geneva Protocol (1924-1925), and the Composition of the Councilof the League (1926). In the case of the Geneva Protocol, His Majesty&apos;s Government originally proposed that a special meeting of the Imperial Conference should be held to consider the issues involved, and it was only when this was found impracticable that it was decided that the matter must be dealt with by correspondence. The question of the composition of the Council was at first dealt with by correspondence, but was subsequently discussed between the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs personally and the Dominion delegates at the Assembly of the League.Consultation by despatch or telegram, however, takes place on such matters as the ratification of treaties imposing active obligations on all parts of the Empire and the negotiation of such treaties in so far as this is not effected at an International Conference. The principles now obtaining are set out in the Resolution of the Imperial Conference of 1923 regarding the negotiation, signature and ratification of treaties.In almost all these cases the initiative comes from His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment, but occasionally a Dominion has consulted His Majesty&apos;s Government on a matter of foreign policy primarily affecting itself (e.g., Canada, in connection with the proposed revision of the Rush-Bagot Convention in 1923). The attitude of the various Dominions in this connection varies. Thus, New Zealand has always been accustomed to work, on matters affecting her relations with foreign countries, in concert with His Majesty&apos;s Government. Canada and the Irish Free State, on the other hand, are disposed to act without adequate consultation, and particulars of their action are often only obtained either just before the event, or afterwards.As regards matters other than foreign affairs, examples of cases in which consultation by despatch or telegram takes place are the preparation of standing schemes for use in the event of war, e.g., censorship, and the detailed arrangements for giving effect to resolutions adopted by the Imperial Conference, e.g., amendments of nationality law.In all cases the correspondence takes one of the two forms already described, i.e., either despatches or telegrams from the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs to the Governor-General and vice versa, or messages from Prime Minister to Prime Minister.(2.) During Imperial Conferences.It is the practice at such Conferences to review the whole field of foreign affairs and to discuss the main lines of policy to be followed, both generally and in regard to particular subjects of immediate urgency, e.g., in 1921 the Anglo-Japanese Alliance, and in 1923 the Reparations situation and the proposed Liquor Treaty with the United States.The same holds good of defence questions, and, as regards other matters, it is usual to consider, not only particular outstanding problems on which common action is desirable, but also such general questions as commercial policy, oversea settlement, and the improvement of wireless communications within the Empire.
APPENDIX B.Communication to Dominion High Commissioners of Copies of Correspondence,with their Governments.THE correspondence with the Dominion Governments, which is communicated to the Dominion High Commissioners in London, falls into three general classes: (I.) Correspondence on subjects in which the High. Commissioner is officially interested.Copies of most inward and outward telegrams and despatches on such subjects as migration, trade, tariffs, loan of naval, military and air personnel, Dominion naval, military or air cadets in this country, regulations relating to passports and visas, and the routine work of the League of Nations, are communicated officially to the respective High Commissioners&apos; offices, generally under cover of a printed form.(II.) Correspondence communicated to the High Commissioner regularly for his personal information.In the case of Canada, the Commonwealth of Australia, the Union of South Africa, and the Irish Free State, special arrangements have been made, at the request, or with the knowledge, of the Dominion Government concerned whereby copies of correspondence are sent regularly to the High Commissioner personally, who is thus enabled to see the communications promptly, without having to await the completion of official action. The classes of correspondence so sent vary in the different cases, but generally speaking they include all telegrams, except telegraphic communications between the Prime Ministers, and except &quot;Personal,&quot; &quot;Personal and Secret,&quot; Honours and political telegrams. In the case of the High Commissioners for Canada and the Irish Free State, despatches are similarly communicated.It is not known precisely to what extent the communications sent under this arrangement are kept personal to the High Commissioner (in the case of the Union of South Africa they are opened by the Secretary), but there is reason to believe that they are shown to members of the High Commissioners&apos; staffs.(UI.)-Correspondence communicated specially to the High Commissioner by the Private Secretary to the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.Communications on some important questions which are excluded from the arrangement under (II) and generally of a secret nature or comprising messages between the Prime Ministers, are, in cases where it is considered the High Commis-. sioner should be kept informed on the particular subject, sent to the High Commissioner marked &quot;Secret and Personal&quot; either in a letter from the Private Secretary or under cover of a printed form &quot;With the compliments of the Private Secretary to the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.&quot; Telegrams to and from the Dominions on such questions as the League of Nations Council, Disarmament, the Pacific Cable, Empire Marketing, are recent examples of this class.The criterion adopted as regards communications on foreign affairs is whether the correspondence is likely to concern the High Commissioners as representatives of the Dominions at the League of Nations Assembly.o

Copy No.   727t7t7&quot; Not Circulated to the Dominions.E (B) 14.CABINET.Imperial Conference, 1926.REPORT No.-4 OF COMMITTEE ON QUESTIONS AFFECTING INTER-IMPERIAL RELATIONS.Representation of the British Empire at International Conferences.League Conferences.Separate invitations, to attend conferences convoked by, or under the auspices of the League of Nations, are issued to the Dominions and to India because they are separate members of the League, and in virtue of such separate membership their representatives speak and act independently. No difficulty arises with regard to these conferences.Such separate representation does not exclude close collaboration with the delegation acting on behalf of the Government in London, and such collaboration should be encouraged and facilitated by means of meetings of all the delegations of the Empire.2. The delegation nominated to act on behalf of the Government in London attends as representing the &quot; British Empire.&quot; It is, indeed, only through the membership of the League conferred on the British Empire by the Annex to the Covenant that the Government in London can secure any representation at all. But, just as for meetings of the Assembly (see Report No. 5) where the Dominions are separately represented, the words &quot; British Empire &quot; must in practice be treated as synonymous with &quot; Great Britain,&quot; so also for the meetings and deliberations of a conference convoked by the League of Nations at which the Dominions are entitled to separate representation, a delegation acting in the name of the &quot; British Empire &apos;&apos; is bound, so far as regards all the work of the Conference, and apart from any question of the signature of the convention, to regard itself for practical purposes as acting on behalf of Great Britain or Great Britain and those parts of the Empire which are not separate members of the League of Nations.Non-League Conferences.3. No regular practice has been established with regard to the issue of invitations to the Dominions to attend international conferences convoked by a foreign Government.   These conferences, however, fall into two main categories :  (a.) Conferences of a political character, of which the Paris Peace Conference of 1919, the Washington Conference of 1921 and the recent Locarno Conference may be taken as examples.(b.) Conferences of a technical character, of which the Immigration Conference at Rome, the Industrial Property Conference at The Hague, the recent Motor Car Conference at Paris and the Tropical Agriculture and Sanitary Conferences (both at Paris) may be taken as examples.4. The object to be aimed at is to secure a procedure which will take account of (i.) The equality of the various units within the British Commonwealth of Nations.(ii.) The necessity for unity of action by all parts of the Empire on issues of first-class importance. 3483-2   [14736]   [14780]
5. Conferences of a political character might be further sub-divided according to the nature of the treaties likely to result, as described in the 16th and following paragraphs of the memorandum on the &quot; Form of Preamble and Signature of Treaties &quot; (Appendix A to Report No. 2). But the only cases where difficulties have so far arisen as regards invitations to such conferences concern those as the result of which active obligations are likely to be imposed on all parts of the Empire, or in which all, or the majority of, the Governments of the Empire are sufficiently interested to demand individual representation. The following paragraphs are limited to political conferences of this nature, as the Committee feel that the procedure in relation to other non-League political conferences is sufficiently dealt with by the Imperial Conference Resolution of 1923 as to the negotiation, &amp;c, of treaties.6. The difficulties referred to above have arisen from the fact that the Dominions have either been excluded entirely from participation in such conferences (as in the case of the Lausanne Conference, 1922-23), or have been included with difficulty (as in the case of the Washington Disarmament Conference, 1921-22).7. In cases of the kind referred to, the right of any of the Governments of the Empire to participate in the work of the Conference should not in any way depend upon the issue of a separate invitation to that Government by the foreign Government convoking the Conference. In fact, logically, only one invitation should be issued by the foreign Government convoking the Conference, inviting the appointment by His Britannic Majesty of plenipotentiaries to take part in the Conference, though this invitation would normally be transmitted through the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs as the established channel of communication with a foreign Power in matters affecting the whole Empire.8. Nevertheless, there has been in the past a very definite tendency on the part of the Dominion Governments to insist on separate invitations from foreign Govern-ments to conferences of the kind in question, and on the last occasion when the question actually came up in a concrete form (viz., when in 1925 the United States Government was understood to be contemplating the summoning of another conference on Naval Disarmament), instructions were sent to His Majesty&apos;s Ambas-ambassador at Washington to endeavour to secure either that separate invitations to the Governments of Great Britain and the Dominions should be issued, or that, if a single invitation were issued, it should specify Great Britain and the Dominions nominatim.9. In view of&quot; this precedent (which was welcomed by the Dominions at the time), and of the League practice of separate invitations, the Committee feel that it is likely to be difficult to obtain the acquiescence of the Dominions in what, as explained above, is agreed to be the logical procedure.10. On the other hand the procedure of separate invitations is likely to be opposed by foreign Governments, who will consider that it implies separate votes. The logical procedure is likely to be more acceptable to them since it does not raise any question as to the number of votes to be accorded to the British Empire and its component parts.11. The Committee feel that this is-a case where the difficulties of the situation ought to be explained and frank discussion invited at the Imperial Conference. They would themselves prefer the adoption of the logical procedure, but, if the acquiescence of the Dominions in it cannot be obtained, it will be necessary to fall back upon the policy of endeavouring to secure from foreign Governments separate invitations to the Governments of Great Britain and the Dominions, or, alternatively (and in the opinion of the Committee preferably), a single invitation mentioning nominatim the various parts of the Empire concerned.12. In either event, it is important to secure that the invitations and the replies to them should be transmitted through the diplomatic channel. It is also important to secure that, whatever the form of the invitation to such a conference, all the Governments of the Empire represented should co-operate as a single British Empire Delegation.13. Whatever procedure is agreed upon, it would be well to embody it in a published resolution of the forthcoming Imperial Conference, to which foreign Governments could be referred.14. Should a conference of the kind under discussion be convened by one of the Governments of the Empire, the invitations to foreign Governments should be issued after consultation between the Governments of the Empire and should indicate that they are issued as the result of such consultation.    Provision should be made for a
British Empire delegation composed of representatives of all the Governments of the Empire which take part.*15. In the case of technical conferences, it is not necessary, and is generally undesirable, that Great Britain and the Dominions should be represented only as part of a British Empire delegation. Their respective interests are not necessarily the same in technical matters. Any British Empire delegation attending a conference must have one man at the head of it who would presumably be one of the representatives of the Government in London, and if one man is to represent, not merely that Govern-ment, but also the Governments of the Dominions, his freedom of action is seriously restricted in any case in which he cannot obtain unanimity among the representatives of the Dominions who form part of the delegation. It is more convenient that they should be allowed to express their own views in the conference than that the repre-sentative of the Government in London should have to take the responsibility of any objections or difficulties which they may raise. Moreover, if the Governments of the Empire concerned do not in practice obtain independence of action in international conferences on technical matters, they will become dissatisfied. In order that Great Britain and the Dominions may have separate delegations and vote separately, separate invitations from the Government convoking the conference appear to be desirable. Therefore, though it is not possible to compel a foreign Government to issue separate invitations to Great Britain and the Dominions, endeavours should be made wherever possible to obtain invitations for them to send, separate delegations to conferences of this kind. In this case, too, each of the Governments of the Empire should endeavour to secure that the invitations should be sent and answered through the diplomatic channel. It is otherwise of little significance what form the invitations take.t(Signed on behalf of the Committee),HUBERT MONTGOMERY,Chairman.Foreign Office, June 30, 1926.* In the case of the London Reparation Conference of 1924, the method of representation adopted was that any of the Dominion, so desiring, and India, might appoint representatives on the British Empire Delegation on tho &quot; panel&quot; system, and that the representatives of the Dominions so appointed were able to be present at meetings of the conference on days when it was not their turn to sit as full members of the British Empire Delegation. In other words, whilst Great Britain had three full representatives at this conference the Dominions and India only shared one full representative between them. Ihis arrangement by no means satisfied the Dominions, and in announcing it to the conference the i-rime Minister (Mr. Ramsay MacDonald) stated that it was a special one for that particular conference, and was not to be regarded or quoted as a precedent.&quot; &quot; , ct Difficulties in relation to invitations to technical conferences are of rare occurrence, and foreign Governments already in many cases issue separate invitations to Great Britain and the Dominions. Frequently also technical conferences arise from previous international conventions which recognise Great Britain and the participating Dominions as separate contracting countries.

Copy No.      / Not Circulated to the Dominions.CABINET.Imperial Conference, 1926.REPORT No. 5 OF COMMITTEE ON QUESTIONS AFFECTING INTER-IMPERIAL RELATIONS.The position of the representative of the Ptrilish Empire on the Council of theLeague of Nations.AT a special meeting of the Assembly of the League of Nations in March, 1926, some discussion arose as to whether the British representation in the Council covered the Dominions or not. It is a question which will almost certainly be raised at the Imperial Conference in October and in any case it-is a point upon which His Majesty&apos;s Government should have a definite policy.2. By article 4 of the Covenant the permanent members of the Council consist of representatives of the Principal Allied and Associated Powers, and by the Preamble to the Treaty of Versailles, it is the British Empire which constitutes a Principal Allied and Associated Power. The only indication which the Covenant gives of the meaning of the phrase &quot;British Empire &quot; in the Covenant is contained in the Annex which is arranged as follows : &quot; Original Members of the League of NationsBrazilBritish Empire Canada Australia South Africa New Zealand india?SECRET. E (B) 15.This arrangement shows that the framers of the Covenant intended the British Empire to include the Dominions.3. On the other hand, there are great practical difficulties in regarding the representative who attends the meetings of the Council on behalf of the Government in London as speaking and acting in the name of the Empire as a whole, and there can he little doubt but that some of the Dominions at any rate do not regard their Governments as comprised within the existing British participation in the Council.4. The reasons for the view entertained by these Dominions are chiefly based upon what happened at Paris in 1919, and partly upon the practical consideration that in existing conditions the representative of the Government in London is not generally in a position to speak or act on behalf of the Dominion Governments. Indeed, the absence of adequate machinery for consultation at present renders it impossible in many cases for him to represent anything more than Great Britain.&quot;5. The framers of the Covenant prepared the original draft of article 4 as follows :--&quot; The Council shall consist of representatives of the United States of America, of the British Empire, of France, of Italy and of Japan, together with representatives of four other States which are members of the League.&quot;3483-3   [14737]   [14781J
After a discussion, in the British Empire Delegation, an amendment was secured to omit the words &quot; States which are,&quot; so that it read: &quot; British Empire together with representatives of four other members of the League.&quot; This alone was not sufficient to satisfy the Dominions, and an assurance, dated the 6th May, 1919 was obtained from M. Clemenceau, President Wilson and Mr. Lloyd George in the following terms: &quot;The question having been raised as to the meaning of article 4 of the League of iSations Covenant, we have been requested by Sir Robert Borden to state whether we concur in his view that, upon the true construction of tho first and second paragraphs of that article, representatives of the self-goveraino-Dominions of the British Empire may be selected or named as members of the Council. We have no hesitation in expressing our entire concurrence ia this view. If there were any doubt, it. would be entirely removed by the fact that the articles of the Covenant are not subject to a narrow or technical construction.&quot;6. The wording of the Covenant, however, remained unchanged, and the permanent member of the Council continues to sit as the representative of the British Empire. In 1920, on the occasion of the first meeting of the Council, the Canadian Government drew attention to the fact that they had not been consulted as to the selection of the representative of the British Empire on the Council, and expressed the opinion that this appointment should not be made until the various Governments of the Empire had been consulted. On the other hand, the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth of Australia (Mr. Hughes) and the Prime Minister of the Union of South Africa (General Smuts) had expressed the view that the &quot; British Empire in this connection meant only the United Kingdom.&quot; The Secretary of State for the Colonies (Lord Milner) regarded this question as an insoluble problem, and accordingly no reply was returned to the Canadian Government.7. Subsequently, in the Debate in the Canadian Parliament on the Canadian Nationals Bill, in July 1921, the Canadian Government expressed the view that &quot; the British Empire, for League purposes, meant the United Kingdom and Colonies and Protectorates.&quot; A similar view was recently expressed in the Irish Free State Parliament, and received the support of the Minister for External Affairs. It is also understood that this view was expressed by the delegates of Canada, the Union of South Africa and the Irish Free State at a meeting of the British Empire delegates during the recent Assembly at Geneva. Indeed, Senator Dandurand, the senior Canadian representative, expressed the view that the Dominions were represented on the Council by the six elected temporary members, in whose election they share. On this point Sir Austen Chamberlain, who had throughout the proceedings informed the Dominion representatives at constant meetings of the British Empire delegates of what had transpired at secret sessions of the Council, stated at a subsequent meeting that, if the British Empire representative on the Council was not the representative of the Dominions, questions might be raised how far he was entitled to do as he was doing. Senator Dandurand agreed that this aspect of the matter would require to be considered.8. The legal validity of the assurance given by M. Clemenceau, Mr. Lloyd George and President Wilson in 1919 is open to question, but undoubtedly it was upon the faith of this statement that the terms of the Covenant were accepted by the Dominion representatives, and without committing a breach of faith it would be impossible at the present time to question it.9. The absence of prior consultation, to which the Canadian Government drew attention in 1920, as to the selection of the permanent representative is only one manifestation of the lack of machinery for adequate consultation over the whole held of foreign affairs, and unless this can be remedied, it will not in any event be feasible for one person to sit at Geneva in the Council and be regarded by all the seven Governments of the Empire as voicing their views adequately.10. Such working basis as can be said to have been arrived at as the result of the experience of the last six 57ears is summed up in the reply to certain questions given by Sir Austen Chamberlain in the House of Commons on the 17th February, 1920, as follows : &quot; By the terms of the Covenant a permanent seat on the Council is attributed to the British Empire, but the extent to which that representative can speak on behalf of the Dominions depends upon the circumstances of each particular case and the character of the communications which have passed between His Majesty s
Government and the Dominion Governments. The Dominions have separate representation in the Assembly, and their representatives there act on the instruc-tions of their own Governments, although frequent consultation of all the Empire delegates takes place.&quot;11. There can be little doubt but that the correct interpretation of the phrase &quot; British Empire,&quot; for the purposes of article 4 of the Covenant, ought to be that it means the whole Empire, including the Dominions. On the other hand, it is unlikely that auy Dominion Government would feel able to abandon the rights which their peoples believe they acquired by the assurance signed by the three Allied statesmen ia Paris in 1919. But the question of the eligibility of the Dominions for a non-permanent seat on the Council seems unlikely to arise in the near future, as the election to those seats is in the hands of the Assembly, aud it is improbable that foreign States will regard a Dominion as otherwise than a unit comprised within the term &quot; British Empire &quot; ; they would, therefore, be reluctant to place in the Council what they would regard as a second British member.12. Merely to let the matter slide, however, is undesirable because, from the point of view of Imperial unity, an effort ought to be made to secure Dominion participation and interest in the work of the Council. For this reason it is desirable that the matter should be discussed at the Imperial Conference and a working arrange-ment devised&apos;.13. His Majesty&apos;s Government must, however, be clear in their own minds whether they desire the phrase &quot;British Empire &quot; in connection with the Council of the League to mean what it says, or whether they wish to treat it as equivalent to &quot;Great Britain.&quot; It cannot mean both, and whichever policy it is decided to adopt should be carried out consistently.14. If the British Empire representative in the Council is to be regarded as representing the whole Empire and not Great Britain only, it renders more urgent the desirability of improving the machinery for prior consultation with the Dominions since constitutionally no representative appointed by one Government of the Empire can commit the others without their consent.15. Moreover, if this policy is adopted the practice now obtaining at Geneva, under which when a question is under discussion which particularly affects a Dominion, a representative of that Dominion is invited to come to the table in addition to the permanent member, could, if challenged, not be maintained and logically should be abandoned. The right to such additional representation given by article 4 (5) of the Covenant would not apply, because its wording is &quot; any member of the League not represented on the Council,&quot; and the Dominion concerned would be represented on the Council by the British Empire representative, and could not, therefore, claim an additional representative.16. If, on the other hand, it is decided that it would be better that the British Empire representative should be treated as representing only Great Britain, the present practice during an Assembly of keeping the Dominion representatives fully informed by meetings with the British Empire representative of all that takes place at Council meetings ought logically from the League point of view to be abandoned, and the Dominion representatives should, from that point of view, be content to stand on ths same footing as the representatives of other States members of the League not represented on the Council. This would lead to a state of affairs entirely inconsistent with the policy of continuous consultation on foreign affairs.17. It would in fact, if the &quot;Great Britain&quot; theory is adopted, be better and more consistent with the assurance given to the Dominions by the three statesmen in Paris in 1919 to get the terms of the Covenant amended so as to make it clear that the permanent representation is accorded to Great Britain. This would leave no doubt as to tire right of the Dominions to additional representation under article 4 (5) of the Covenant. Any question, however, of amending the Covenant introduces a new difficulty, because the attitude of the Australian and New Zealand representatives at Geneva in March 1926 showed that, in their opinion, the British Empire representative on the Council represented the whole Empire, and they might be unwilling to agree to an amendment.18. &apos;1 he best line, therefore, on which His Majesty&apos;s Government can frame their policy would seem to be to assume, though without saying so, that the election ot auy Dominion to a non-permanent seat on the Council is unlikely, and to endeavour to secure Dominion participation in the work of the Council without change in the terms of the Covenant.   For this purpose it should be agreed that the meaning of the
Covenant provision under which the &quot; British Empire &quot; is represented on the Council is that the representative in question, while nominated by His Majesty&apos;s Government and primarily responsible to them, is nevertheless bound, in view of the constitutional position of the British Empire and the established practice in foreign affairs, to consult fully with the Dominions before agreeing to any action which may affect their interests. It results from this (1) that the representative in question must be entitled to keep the Dominion Governments fully informed of the proceedings of the Council ; (2) that in these conditions he is correctly described as the representative of the British Empire. It is hoped that if a Resolution on these lines were passed by the Imperial Conference the views of Canada, the Union of South Africa and the Irish Free State would be met. Dominion interest in the proceedings of the Council should be quickened by prior consultation with Dominion representatives before every meeting of the Council, and an arrangement should be come to at the Imperial Conference that, while normally the representative of the Government in London would be the British Empire representative on the Council, if at a Council meeting any question arises which is of greater interest to a Dominion Government than to the Government in London, a representative of the Dominion concerned should take the place of the representative of the Government in London during the discussion of that question and should sit as the British Empire representative. .19. To give practical effect to the suggestion made above for prior consultation, it Avill be necessary for a meeting always to be held in London before the British Empire representative goes to Geneva for any Council meeting. To this meeting representatives of all the Dominions should be invited, and each item of the agenda of the Council meeting should be examined and discussed in order that full effect may be given to the Dominion views on any point.(Signed on behalf of the Committee), HUBERT MONTGOMERY,Foreign Office, June 30, 1926.Chairman.

CABINET.IMPERIAL CONFERENCE, 1926.Report No. 6 of Committee on Questions affecting Inter-Imperial Relations.Questions arising from Commercial Treaties.IN their previous reports the Committee have dealt with a number of the subjects falling under the head of questions affecting inter-Imperial relations, which were mentioned in the Report of the Imperial Conference (Agenda) Committee (CP. 124/26).   The present report deals with two matters not there mentioned :  (I.) The interpretation and use of the term &quot; British subjects &quot; in commercial treaties.(II.) The question of arrangements for the withdrawal of Great Britain from commercial treaties concluded by her with foreign countries to which other parts of the Empire have become parties.I. The interpretation and use of the term &quot;British Subjects&quot; in Commercial .Treaties.2. Under the existing model draft commercial treaty, which was prepared some fifteen years ago after consultation with the Dominions, certain rights are conferred upon &quot;the subjects or citizens of the Contracting Parties.&quot; The Contracting Parties to the treaty are Heads of States, and the treaty refers through-out to the territories of the Contracting Parties, but the treaty contains a clause providing that its stipulations shall not apply to India, or any of His Majesty&apos;s self-governing Dominions, Colonies, Possessions or Protectorates, unless notice of accession is given on their behalf; since the war a further clause has been included providing that the stipulations of the accession article shall apply also to Mandated Territories.3. Questions have in the past been raised in connection with commercial treaties framed on the above lines, as to the position in the foreign country concerned of British subjects connected with parts of the Empire which did not accede. The matter was referred to the Law Officers on tw*o occasions (1899 and 1911), and they then gave it as their opinion that all persons who by British law are recognised as British subjects were entitled to the benefits of the treaty in question, even if connected with a part of the Empire which did not accede to it. In other words, rights under the treaty are enjoyed by British subjects connected with any part of the Empire, though the obligations of the treaty do not extend to any part of the Empire outside this country, unless that part specifically accedes. This standpoint has been maintained by His Majesty&apos;s Government in communications with foreign Governments which have raised the question in particular cases.4. A decision which might be regarded as casting doubt on the above inter-pretation was given by the United States Supreme Court in 1920 on a case arising under the Real and Personal Property Convention with the United States of 1899, where it was held that a British subject resident in Canada (which had not acceded to the Convention) was not entitled to the benefits of the Convention in the United States. This was, however, a somewhat special case, since the Convention related only to the rights of persons (whereas general commercial treaties confer other rights, e-g., in respect of treatment of goods and ships), and, moreover, His Majesty&apos;s Government had taken special action in this instance by the conclusion of a supple-mentary agreement to extend the time within which other parts of the Empire might accede to the Convention, so that it was arguable that accession to the Convention 3483-4   [14764]   [14814]
must involve some benefit to the acceding parts of the Empire, and the only possible benefit would be the enjoyment of rights under the Convention by British subjects connected with those parts of the Empire.5. Since the war consideration has from time to time been given by His Majesty&apos;s Government to the question whether it would be desirable in future negotiations to alter the form of general commercial treaties so as to&apos; exclude British subjects connected with a non-acceding part of the Empire from the benefits conferred by the treaty on British subjects as such. If in the negotiation of a treaty the point was seriously raised by a foreign Government His Majesty&apos;s Government might have considerable difficulty in supporting the present practice, and might only be able to secure it at the price of other concessions. Moreover, if in connection with an existing treaty a dispute arose on this point it cannot be taken as certain that the Permanent Court or an international body of arbitrators would support our contention.6. On the other hand, the present procedure is a useful exemplification of Imperial unity, and a change would involve certain practical difficulties. The question has recently been raised again in connection with the Resolution of the Imperial Conference of 1923 on the subject of the negotiation, signature and ratification of treaties, as some doubt has been felt whether the principles underlying that Resolution do not require that, since commercial treaties affect the interests of persons connected with other parts of the Empire, His Majesty&apos;s Government should obtain the prior concurrence of the Governments of those parts in their conclusion, and whether such a procedure would not hamper His Majesty&apos;s Government in negotiating such treaties. No difficulty has, however, been experienced in practice by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the negotiation of commercial treaties in conformity with the terms of the 1923 Resolution; since the normal procedure is, as soon as negotiations with a foreign Government are opened, to send to the Dominion Governments copies of the draft treaty presented to the foreign Government, with a view to giving them an opportunity of expressing their views, if they wish, and to keep them informed of any important developments which may occur in the course of negotiations.7. No Dominion Government has so far suggested (either generally or in connection with any particular treaty) any alteration in the present practice, whereby the rights under commercial treaties negotiated by His Majesty&apos;s Government are conferred upon all British subjects, and so far there has been no indication that the Dominions generally desire to conclude treaties with foreign countries relating to the rights of persons. The only Dominions which have hitherto concluded commercial treaties with foreign countries have been Canada and the Union of South Africa, and with one exception the treaties which they have negotiated do not relate to the rights of subjects, but only to treatment of goods and similar matters. The exception is the Commercial Convention of 1922 between Canada and France which confers certain rights on the &quot;subjects&quot; or &quot;nationals &quot; of the High Contracting Parties, the High Contracting Party on the Canadian side being His Majesty the King, but in this respect the treaty is not a desirable precedent The fact that the inhabitants of Dominions enjoy the benefits secured for all British subjects under the treaties negotiated by His Majesty&apos;s Government (i.e., all that Dominion Governments are likely to get for their people under treaties of their own) makes it unnecessary for Dominions to insert such provisions in their own treaties.8. In one or two cases wuhere commercial treaties have been under negotiation&quot; with foreign countries, the representatives of those countries have raised the question of the position of British subjects connected with non-acceding parts of the Empire, but they have been induced not to press the matter. In the majority of cases it would appear that the foreign Governments have not been alive to the point at all.9. In the circumstances the Committee think that it would be preferable that His Majesty&apos;s Government should not take the initiative in regard to this question, either at the Imperial Conference or otherwise, but should wait until it is raised either by a Dominion Government, or by a foreign Power which definitely objects to entering into a commercial treaty unless British subjects connected with non-acceding parts of the Empire are excluded from its operations.10. If the representatives of any^ of the Dominions should raise the question at the forthcoming Imperial Conference, the Committee suggest that the representatives of His Majesty&apos;s Government should explain the position as described above, and invite the views&apos; of the representatives of the Dominions and India
generally, and that, unless those views are definitely in favour of an alteration of the existing practice, the representatives of His Majesty&apos;s Government should propose to maintain this practice so long as they can continue to induce foreign Powers to accept it. to11. If the question should be raised bya foreign Power in connection with the negotiation of a new treaty, and not by a Dominion Government, the Committee consider that an endeavour should be made to induce the foreign Power to withdraw its objection, though they realise that the present position could not be maintained against serious attack.12. If it eventually becomes necessary to modify the wording at present employed in commercial treaties, the method of doing &quot;so least open to objection would seem to be the addition of an article on the following lines :_&quot;The stipulations of Articles . . . .* of the present Treaty shall not be invoked by either High Contracting Party in respect of the subjects or citizens of such High Contracting Party who are habitually resident in any part of the territories of that Party to which the present Treaty does not apply.&quot;The terms of any such modification would, of course, have to be agreed with the Dominions and India beforehand.II. The question of arrangements for the withdrawal of Great Britain from Commercial Treaties concluded by her with foreign countries to tohich other parts of the Empire have become Parties.13. As described above, most commercial treaties negotiated by His Majesty&apos;s Government with Foreign Governments apply in the first instance only to this country, but contain provision for separate accession on the part of the Dominions, Colonies, &amp;c. Such treaties contain provision for separate denunciation on the part of any acceding Dominion or Colony, but there is no provision whereby this country could -withdraw, leaving the treaty in force as regards acceding Dominions and Colonies.14. The Committee have considered, therefore, whether it may not be desirable in future to insert in commercial treaties to be negotiated by His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment a provision whereby this country could withdraw, leaving the Treaty in force as regards the acceding Dominions and Colonies. Such a provision would in any case where denunciation of the Treaty is contemplated avoid the present necessity of previous consultation with those Dominions who are parties to the Treaty.15. There are, however, two reasons against taking any action on the above hues : -(1.) It is probable that foreign Governments w^oulcl object to a provision, which would result in leaving them, after the withdrawal of Great Britain, with a Dominion or Colony as the only other party to a treaty originally made with this country.(2.) If in pursuance of such a provision His Majesty&apos;s Government denounced the treaty, leaving it still in force between a foreign country and a Dominion or Colony, the expression &quot;subjects of the Contracting Parties&quot; would (on the present construction of that expression) still operate to confer the benefit of the treaty on all British subjects a result which would certainly provoke the foreign Power concerned to challenge the interpretation hitherto accepted by foreign Governments in the case of treaties to which Great Britain is a party.In the circumstances the Committee recommend that no action should be taken as regards this question, and that it should not be raised by FIisMajesty&apos;s Government at the Imperial Conference.(Signed on behalf of the Committee),HUBERT MONTGOMERY,Chairman.Foreign Office, July 8, 1926.the articles relating to the rights of British subjects.

Not Circulated to the Dominions.CABINET.IMPERIAL CONFERENCE, 1926.report No. 6 of Committee on Questions affecting Inter-Imperial Relations.Questions arising from Commercial/Treaties.IN their previous reports the Committee have/dealt with a number of the subjects falling under the head of questions affecting/inter-lmperial relations, which were mentioned in the Rewort of the Imperial Conference (Agenda) Committee (CP. 124/26).   The presentVeport deals with two^atters not there mentioned :  (I.) The interpretation and use of the term/&quot; British subjects &quot; in commercial treaties. \ /(II.) The question of arrangements for the withdrawal of Great Britain from commercial treatiesVmcluded hf her with foreign countries to wdiich -   other parts of the Empire haveybecome parties.I. The interpretation and use of th\prm &quot;British Subjects&quot; in Commercial I Treaties.2.   Under the existing model draft\commercial treaty, which was prepared some fifteen years ago after consulta/ionWith the Dominions, certain rights are conferred upon &quot;the subjects or c/tizen\ of the Contracting Parties.&quot;    The Contracting Parties to the treaty are/Heads (\f States, and the treaty refers through-( out to the territories of the Contracting Parties, but the treaty contains a clause I providing that its stipulations shall not apply to India, or any of His Majesty&apos;s 1 self-governing Dominions, Coloni/s, Possessions or Protectorates, unless notice of accession is given on their behalf/ since the war a further clause has been included providing that the stipulations of the accession article shall apply also to Mandated Territories. / \3. Questions have in the&apos; past been raised in connection with commercial treaties framed on the above lines, as to the position in the foreign country concerned of British subjects connected ^vith parts of the Empire which did not accede. The matter was referred to the Lq/w Officers on two occasions (1899 and 1911), and they then gave it as their opinion/that all persons who by British law are recognised as British subjects were entitled to the benefits of the treaty in question, even if connected with a part of the Empire which did not accede to it. In other words, rights under the treaty are/enjoyed by British subjects connected with any part of the Empire, though the obligations of the treaty do not extend to any part of the Empire outside this country, unless that part specifically accedes. This standpoint has been maintained by His Majesty&apos;s Government in communications with foreign Governments which have/raised the question in particular cases.4. A decision which   might be regarded as casting doubt on the above inter-pretation was given by the United States Supreme Court in 1920 on a case arising under the Real and Personal Property Convention with the United States of 1899, where it was held that a British subject resident in Canada (which had not acceded to the Convention) was not entitled to the benefits of the Convention in the United States. This was, however, a somewhat special case, since the Convention related only to the rights of persons (whereas general commercial treaties confer other rights, e-rJ; in respect of treatment of goods and ships), and, moreover, His Majesty&apos;s Government had taken special action in this instance by the conclusion of a sqpple-nientary agreement to extend the time within wdiich other parts of the Empire might accede to the Cqnvention, so that it was arguable that accession to the Convention 3483-4   [14764]&apos; [14814]
must involve some benefit to the acceding parts of the Empire, and the only possible benefit would be the enjoyment of rights under the Convention by British subjects connected with those parts of the Empire.5. Since the war consideration has from time to time been given by His Majesty&apos;s Government to the question whether it would be desirable in future negotiations to alter the form of general commercial treaties so as to exclude British subjects connected with a non-acceding part of the Empire from the benefits conferred by the treaty on British subjects as such. If in the negotiation of a treaty the point was seriously raised by a foreign Government His Majesty&apos;s Government might have considerable difficulty in supporting the present practice, and might only be able to secure it at the price of other concessions. Moreover, if in connection with an existing treaty a dispute arose on this point it cannot be taken as certain that the Permanent Court or an international body of arbitrators would support our contention.6. On the other hand, the present procedure is a useful exemplification of Imperial unity, and a change would involve certain practical difficulties. The question has recently been raised again in connection with the Resolution of the Imperial Conference of 1923 on the subject of the negotiation, signature and ratification of treaties, as some doubt has been felt whether the principles underlying that Resolution do not require that, since commercial treaties affect the interests of persons connected with other parts of the Empire, His Majesty&apos;s Government should obtain tne prior concurrence of the Governments of those parts in their conclusion, and Whether such a procedure would not hamper His Majesty&apos;s Government in negotiating such treaties. No difficulty has, however, been experienced in practice by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the negotiation of commercial treatiesVn conformity with the terms of the 1923 Resolution&apos;; since the normal procedure is,\as soon as negotiations with a foreign Government are opened, to send to the Dominion (governments copies of the draft treaty presented to the foreign Government, v&amp;this view to giving them an opportunity of expressing their views, if they wish, and tpikeep them informed of any important developments which may occur in the course     negotiations.7. No Dominion Government has so far suggested (either generally or in connection with any particular treaty) any alteration in the present practice, whereby the rights under^ commercial treaties negotiated by His Majesty&apos;s Government are conferred uppm all British subjects, and so far there has been no indication that the D^minions^ generally desire to conclude treaties with foreign countries relating to the rights di persons. The only Dominions which have hitherto concluded commercial treaties with foreign countries have been Canada and the Union of South Africa, andj with one exception the treaties which they have negotiated do not relate to the nights of subjects, but only to treatment of goods and similar matters. The exception is the Commercial Convention of 1922 between Canada and France which confers certain rights on the &quot;subjects&quot; or &quot;nationals&quot; of the High Contractirfg Parties, the High Contracting Party on the Canadian side being His Majesty tie King, but in this respect the treaty is not a desirable precedent. The fact that the inhabitants of Dominions enjoy the benefits secured for all British subjects under the /treaties negotiated by His Majesty&apos;s Government (i.e., all that Dominion Governments are likely to get for their people under treaties of their own) makes it unnecessary for Dominions to insert such provisions in their own treaties.8. In one or two cases where commercial treaties have been under negotiation with foreign countries, the representatives of those countries have raised the question of the position of British subjects connected with non-acceding parts of the Empire, but they have been induced not to press the matter. In the majority of cases it would appear that the foreign Governments have not been alive to the point at all.9.
