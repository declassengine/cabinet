HANKEY,Secretary to the Cabinet.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.I. May 17th,  1926.
Foreign Office, May,  1926.Sir R. Lindsay,&apos;ntincple.Telegram No. -Your telegram No. 77  (of May 11.    Angora negotiations).If on return to Angora you find your surmise about Turkish attitude correct and see that a deal is feasible it is essential that so favourable an opportunity be not missed. His Majesty&apos;s Government are therefore prepared to find sum up to maximum of  500,000 and you are authorised to negotiate with. Turkish M.F.A. with a vie?/ to immediate settlement on this basis.For your own information,  I would explain that incidence of cost between His Majesty&apos;s Government and Irak Government is still under discussion.If Turkish M.F.A. prefer participation in oil royalties up to maximum of 20**&apos; for 25 years, Your Excellency is at liberty  to accept.      You. are already aware that in this event there would be no royalties for first few years and that even later amount is entirely problematical.Settlement on a lump sum basis would be in effect compensation for final extinction of Turkey&apos;s interest in Irak oil.      Had Turkish M.F.A. not objected to mention of lump sum in treaty, no difficulty would have arisen in drafting formula.      In present circumstances formula in treaty i might be that His Majestyrs Government and-Irak Government J recognising Turkey&apos;s desire to participate in development of Irak oil are prepared- to&apos; agree to Turkey having an annual
charge of  x     over a term of years in lieu of active participation or royalties.This   would he followed toy clause making provision for commutation of annuity by lump sum payment.      The amount of annuity would of course depend on the exact lump sum for which you settle.      In any case payment will not toe made until treaty enters Into force.
