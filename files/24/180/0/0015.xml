S S C R E T. Copy No.  tJ: ^&quot; C A 3 I IT B T.CP. 21?  (26).IMPORT OP FOREIGN COAL.Memorandum &quot;by the Chairman of the Supply and transport committee.The Supply and Transport Committee considered,  at their meetings of May-26th and June 1st,  the Memorandum by the Secretary for Mines (CP. 214 (26)),  in which authority was sought for the purchase and importation on Government account of 400,000 tons of coal,  of which 200,000 tons would be ordered immediately,The Committee felt that consumers of coal should he stimulated to the utmost to import coal on their own account instead of relying on Government importations.      They were informed that labour difficulties in the unloading and handling of imported ooal within the Unixed Kingdom were not likely, and they agreed that enquirers should be assured that the Government would afford protection for its unloading and handling,  if protection were found necessary.     Nevertheless, they were advised that no stimulation of private enterprise would persuade the smaller coal consumer in essential trades (such as small food-producing firms)  either to order imported coal themselves or to make advance contracts with the Government for its purchase if imported on Government account .      Such businesses indeed worked upon a scale which made it impossible for them to take the risk of such commitments,The Committee further explored the possibility of importing Continental in preference to American coal. They were, however, advised that the possibility of labour difficulties on the Continent,  coupled with the attitude of the Westphalian Syndicate (who were likely to insist on selling from a dump of 8,000,000 -1ons hewn some years ago) made this course inadvisable in the caseggg POffCMBMg IS THS PROPERTY CP HIS BRITANNIC, MAJESTY1 S GQ\^SE3JMaiTT. )-
frt least of the first 200,000 tons,  though this source of supply could be further considered before the second 200, 000 tons were ordered.      It was added that the American coal was in general of better quality than the Continental and could always be disposed of&apos;at a reasonable price.It was agreed to recommend to the Cabinet(i) that the-Mines Department should be authorised to buy and import forthwith 200,000 tons of coal from the United States of America and Canada ;(ii) that no public announcement of this decision should be made until the Mines Department had concluded their contracts for purchase, l.e., for a period of about one week;(iil) that in the announcement then made, it shouldbe emphasised that the coal so Imported would be disposed of solely to small consumers engaged on essential services;(Iv) that no general public declaration should be made in regard to protection for the handling of coal imported by private importers, but that the Mines Department should be authorised to give assurances to enquirers that   protection would be forthcoming and that, if any question were raised In Parliament, a statement to the same effect should, be made.(v)    that It should be left to the Committee to authorise the purchase and importation of a further- 200,000 tons;  if necessary,  at a later date.Signed on behalf of the Committee, W,  JOYNSON-HICKS..
