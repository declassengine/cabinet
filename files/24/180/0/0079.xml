document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Governments)1,CABINET. 71   f\278(26). ^EMERGENCY REGULATIONS.Memorandum by the Home Secretary.As my colleagues are aware, the Regulations under the Emergency Act,  1920, only operate for a month.     At the end of oach month it is necessary,  if they are to be continued, to make a fresh Ordor-in-Counoil re-proclaiming the emergency, to re-make the Regulations by a fresh Order-in-Counoil and to submit them to Parliament for a confirming Resolution.      The Regulations now in force will expire at the end of July and a fresh Resolution of the House will be necessary if they are to be continued throughout August.      If they are to be continued throughout September and October,  it will be necessary for the House to meet at the end of August and again at the end of September.In these circumstances I have carefully considered the question of the need for continuing the Regulations.     There are certain Regulations of which no use is now being-made and of which need is unlikely to arise unless the situation alters materially.These are -Regulation 1. Power to take possession of land, etc. Regulation 2.     Power to take possession of food,forage, material and stores. Regulation 3.      Supply and distribution of food,  etc. Regulation 4.     Road Transport.Regulation 5.     Power to direct traffic on highways. Regulation 6.      Driving licences.Regulation 7.      Railways, light railways and tramways-Regulation 8,      Canals,  etc. Regulation 9.     Priority in transport. Regulation 17.   Motor spirit. Regulation 18.    Telegraph messages. Regulation 23.    Unlawful drilling,  etc. Regulation 24.    Employment of His Maje.?.*y&apos;s Forces. Regulation 25.    Billeting.On the other hand certain of the Regulations, including.in particular the Regulations for the control of coal, for economy in lighting,  etc.,  are clearly essential so long aathe coal stoppage continues.
-2-Moreover, there are certain of the Regulations, which I may describe as Police Regulations,  of which continuance Is? in my view absolutely necessary.       These include Regulation 20  (Injury to Property) and Regulation 21 (Acts likely to cause sedition).      Regulation 21 is the most controversial of all the Regulations;    and if this Regulation,  and Regula-tion S3 which deals with arrest without warrant,  are retained, there is probably no advantage in attempting to shorten the code.      While these Regulations remain there will be the same opposition in Parliament and this opposition would not be lessened by the omission of such Regulations as those referred to above.I have made special enquiry with regard to Regulations 20 and 21 and find that they are in frequent use throughout the country.      In the month of June there were 28 prosecutions under Regulation 20 and 4-0 prosecutions under Regulation 21. The omission of these Regulations would seriously hamper the work of the Police and discourage their efforts and would encourage the agitators and mischief makers, who would regard the discontinuance of the Regulations as an invitation to renewed activity on the ground that there had been a change of policy and that the check on inflammatory speeches and threatening demonstrations had been removed.      If any considerable body of the coal-miners go back to work, there is almost certain to be fresh trouble,  and persons with Communist or extremist views will do their utmost to make difficult the position of those men who are willing to work. Proceedings under the Common Law would be quite ineffective as a check on such persons.      A Common Law indictment for sedition, besides being exceedingly cumbrous and placing an undue burden on the Police and prosecuting authoriT,ies,  is an extremely dilatory proceeding.      Weeks may elapse between the date on which the offender is committed for trial and the date on which he is tried.      In the meantime he will probably be out on bail continuing his mischievous activities.
-3- 478Accordingly my opinion is that we must continue not only the Regulations which deal with the use of coal, but also the controversial Regulations which are required by the Police for the suppression of disorder.      This means that we must face the tiresome necessity of summoning Parliament at the end of August and again at the end of September,  if unfortunately the mining dispute still remains unsettled, and of securing a proper, attendance of Government  supporter-s.W.J.H.20th July,  1926.
