At a meeting on February 26th,  1926,  (Cabinetaiid termsOP 8 (26) Cono.ln.sion 6),  the Cabinet agreed that the&quot; REFERENCE.question of Leasehold Enfranchisement should be con-sidered in the first instance by a Cabinet Committee composed as follows  i-Tho Lord Chancellor       (In the Chair).The Lord Privy seal the Home secretary the Secretary of State for vVarThe Secretary of State for india the First Lord of the admiralty the At torney-Gene r a1 The Secretary 6f State for India has been prevented by other engagements from attending the meetings of the Committee.2,      Leasehold reform in its various aspects has been prominently and continuously before the public throughout the last 50 years.     The question was exhaustively discussed In the Report of the Select Committee on Town Holdings dated the 12th July, 1889 (Crcd. 251 of 1889, and also (on narrower lines) in the Report of the Select Committee on Business Premises dated the 14th December, 1920 (Cmd. 237 of 1920), Numerous Bills to enable lease-holders compulsorily to acquire the fee simple of their
holdings nave from time to time been introduced in Parliament; and in connection with two such Bills presented in 1924 the Council of the Surveyors Institution prepared a Memorandum setting out the objections to Leasehold Enfranchisements and at the same time Indicating the views of the Council on certain other aspects of leasehold reform.     Among other documents the Committee have also examined the proposals on this subject contained in the Urban Report (Towns and the Land) of the Liberal Land Committee, and the criticisms thereon of a Committee of the Council of the Surveyors&apos;  Institution.      The Committee have conferred with a Deputation from the Town Tenants League of Great Britain, whose proposals are embodied in the Town Tenants (England and Wales) Bill recently introduced in the House of Commons by Mr. Womensley .LEASEHOLD 3,      Leasehold Enfranchisement      the compulsoryppRXNCHTSE-.K5KT, transfer of one manTs property to another - need not beconsidered at  length. &apos;-    It is fully dealt with in the 1889 Report of the Select Committee on Town Holdings, and In the memoranda of the Surveyors&apos; Institution referred to above,      It would discourage building and the Improvement of property, destroy the character of residential estates,  tend to check trade development, and depreciate investments in ground rents. The Surveyors&apos;  Institution state that the-available evidence directly controverts the claim that the leasehold S7/stem tends to bad building and neglect of repairs; and they add that &quot;it will be generally
agreed by those conversant with the subject thatthe condition of snail freehold property is usuallyworse than that of leasehold property of thesame character&quot;.      Enfranchisement would be of nouse to tenants who.cannot afford to buy or who could make better use of- their capital by investing itin their business.     The Labour Party are understood to be opposed to Leasehold Enfranchisement on the groundthat it would, increase the number of occupyingowners.      In the opinion of the Committee all proposalsfor the general enfranchisement of leaseholds shouldbe rejected.4.     For similar reasons the Committee feel unable to recommend the Cabinet to entertain proposals (such as are found in the Town Tenants.Bill) for giving to leaseholders generally a right of renewal -sometimes disguised as &quot;compensation for unreasonable disturbance&quot; - at the end of the term,      It is not in normal circumstances unreasonable to hold a lessee to his bargain which only gives him a right of possession during the term.LEASEHOLD bo      The real grievances of lessees may beprSiTBTLTIFlBS,classed under three heads -(a) Improvements made by the tenant pass to the landlord at the end of the terra.(b) &quot;then a trade has been suecessfully carried on upon leasehold premises during the term and a goodwill has been created,  the goodwill is saidto be confiscated or a larger rent de-manded by reason of it when the term comes to an end,(c) Covenants relating to such matters as repairs and dilapidations, \ alterations of the demised premises or their user for particular trades, assignments or sub-lettings, are alleged to be unreasonably enforced.RIGHT OF

No doubt the contract between the partiescontemplates that improvements made by the tenant will only be enjoyed by hin during the term and will benefit the landlord at its closej    but nevertheless, when the term comes to an   end and the property is re-let at a higher rent (possibly to the seme tenant) by reason of improvements for which the landlord has not paid,  the tenant not unnaturally   feels that he has been hardly dealt with,IMPROVEMENTS   7,      In the Gomp-.ittee&apos; s view it would be inequitable EFFECTEDT1F.?0RE to make retrosoective provisions giving compensationaSETDTNGLEGISLATION.    for Improvements made prior to the introduction oflegislation.      In the majority of cases in which such improvements have been made, landlords havered no power (such as would have to be reserved for them under any Bill) to object to the improvements or to execute them for themselves.     Moreover reversions have been dealt with on the footing that they include the reversion to the improvements without compensation.     The Liberal Land Committee recognise the impracticability of demanding compensation for pre-legislatlon improvements,0IMPROVEMENTS   a,     The position is different as regardsARTER &quot;AMEND-   improvements made after the passage of legislation.

the addition to the letting value of the holding directly resulting from the improvement, It is suggested that the procedure should he somewhat on the lines of Clause 3 of the Town Tenants Bill. A lessee    contemplating an improvement should give notice to the landlord and if the landlord objects the matter should be referred to a tribunal to be established as proposed below.      The Tribunal should be authorised to decide the question on broad lines,  i,e.  after        taking into consideration all the circumstances of the case, Including the length of the term,  the Interests of lessor, the lessees and the public, and to impose such terms as it may think fit in the event of it deciding to authorise the improvements \.;&apos;&apos;\!::s
1 SUE-LEASES        9. It will &quot;be necessary to provide that a sub lessorpaying compensation to his lessee shall be entitled at the end of his term to claim from his immediate landlord in respect of unexhausted improvements on the general lines of clause 4 of the Town Tenants Bill.IpROVISIOPS jpTgHh PRO-JBCglOE OF EKE LESSOR.10.        It is suggested that the lessor should be under no liability to pay compensation for improvements in thefollowing circumstancesfa) Where he has made an offer to the tenant,  In the opinion of the tribunal reasonably,  of a new tenancy or a renewal of the lease, with the right to the tenant to dispose of his interest therein and the tenant has refused the offer. (Town Tenants Bill,  Clause 2(1 )).(b) Where he has undertaken himself to effect the improvement, unless he has failed to implement his undertaking within a reasonable time.    (Town Tenants Bill,  Clause 2(2)). 1(c) Where the improvement has been made in pursuance of a contract entered into for valuable consideration.(d) Where the premises are about to be demolished or used for a different purpose at&apos; the end of the term.It will also be necessary to protect the lessor in oas&apos;p.swhere the tribunal authorising the improvement had imposedterms governing the eventual compensation for theimprovement, especially as regards improvements suitableonly for a special trade or business.11. Finally it may be necessary to provide  for thecase of the reversioner who has only a limited interest or who for some other reason may &quot;be quite unable to meet claims for improvements when the leases  fall in.      It
has been suggested that the legislation should provide that when a lessee seeks to rneke expensive improvements of a character likely to constitute a heavy claim on the lessor and the tribunal 0 ecldes in spite of the opposition of the lessor that the improvement should be carried out, that the lessor shall have the right to require the lessee to ptirchase the reversion and that if he refuses to purchase he must either abandon the improvement or execute it at his own cost without compensation.12. The conclusions of the Select Committee of 1889 as tothe grievance of lessees in the matter of goodwill are statedin the Report of that Committee as follows -&quot;As regards goodwill, the Committee have come to the conclusion upon the evidence that, though there are exceptions, yet as a rule the value of the tenant rs goodwill is not  considered in fixing the rent on renewal, nor is it ordinarily used to extort from him more than the fair value of the premises.&quot;&quot;On the other hand,  it  cannot be doubted that cases of hardship do occur in connection with goodwill,  and that landlords sometimes take undue advantage of their tenants position in such cases;    and it is clear that when the renewal of a lease of &quot;business premises is under&apos; discussion, the fact of the tenant having created, a valuable goodwill gives the landlord considerable power to settle the terms of such renewal in his own favour  .&quot;As  respects goodwill,  It would be very difficult to say how much of it belongs to the site, and how much to the person of the trader;  and we think it must generally be possible for a tenant whose lease has expired to get suitable premises elsewhere,   to which his trade,  if its success be the  result of his own merits, would probably follow him.      Good-will, independently of improvements,  is of an ephemeral character; and under the suggested measure a landlord might,  on the departure of a successful tenant, have to pay a large sum for the alleged increase in the value of his premises which would be lost on the failure of the next tenant to caasry on a profitable business th ere.&quot;
The Surveyors&apos;&apos;   Institution would give a lessee the rightto apply to the tribunal ii he is of opinion that anincrease of rent demanded by the lessor in respect of a renewal of the lease is wholly or in part calculated uponthe value of his goodwill or upon improvements for which heTh ehas not received compensation-    /Town Tenants Bill proposes that the tenant of trade premises shall have the right either (under clause 5) to be compensated,    for the loss of goodwill or (under clause 6) to have the tenancy renewed for ars undefined period-      The liberal Land Committee would give a statutory right to renewal in all cases, with  certain exceptions, and in the excepted cases a right of compensation for goodwill.TION 13. The Committee accept the view that some unconscionablelandlords do take advantage of their position to extract fromtheir tenants the value of part of their goodwill,  and it is.They considerdesirable,  though  difficult,  to provide a remedy-/ that when at the end of a term it is proved to the satisfaction of the tribunal that the tenant of trade or business premises has created a goodwill attached to the demised premises the financial benefit of which will,  in the absence of arrangements to the contrary,  accrue to the landlord, the tenant shall be entitled to compensation for any loss of goodwill which may be caused by the  removal of his business-    The landlord however to have the option in lieu of paying compensation to offer the tenant an extension of his tenancy at the market rent of the premises irrespective of the goodwill, the rent and period  of extension to be determined in case of dispute by the tribunal.. In certain cases it may be that the most e quit able solution is to be found In the acquisition by the tenant of the landlord l*s interest in the demised premises, but while the tribunal might be empowered to resort to this alternative in very exceptional cases it should only do so when &amp;j$$t&amp;fled that in no other way can the interests of all parties be effectively safeguarded-&apos;,
caseous14.     Grievances respecting onerous covenants have to some extant been removed   by recent legislation. Under Section 04 of the Law of Props rty Act, 1935, a price may not be exacted for a licence to. assign or under-let, md under Section 147 the Court may give relief if satisfied that a notice to repair is unreasonable;    while undor Section 102 of the Housing Act, 1925, the Court may authorise the eon-vorsion of a house into several tenements notwith-standing the existence of restrictive covenants. Complaints, however,  are frequently made regarding claims for damages for failure to repair the demised premises or to leave them in repair at the end of tho lsase. It is said that a landlord intending to pull down the premises at the end of the term nevertheless exacts from the outgoing tenant the full sum which would be required for putting the existing buildings into good repair,  and puts the damages so obtained into his pocket.      The surveyors  Institution propose that this grievance should be met by providing that the measure of damages shall   be the actual damage to the reversion, and not the cost of putting the premises into repair; and the Committee agree. with this proposal. lspjxtgs as to epairs *The Committee also suggest that it might be enacted that all disputes as to repairs whether arising during or at the end of the term, shall be referred at the instance of either party to the tribunal, thus effecting&apos; a considerable saving in the costs of litigat ion.
Landlords1. 7jonsen5 to Hteratijm &quot;of vt em is asLiability of LesseTliiffcor assignment.15.     Many leases already contain a provision to the effect that the consent of the landlord to an alteration of the demised premises or of their user or to an assign-ment or sub lease shall not be unreasonably withheld. The Committee recommend that it should be enacted that provisions on tho so linos should, be incorporated in all future leases.       The Committee also consider that it should, be made illegal to exact a fine or increase of rent for consenting to an improvement.16.     The surveyors  Institution agree with the Liberal Land Committee that tho tribunal should be empowered, whan satisfied that the circumstances warrant it, to discharge a lessee from all obligations under a laasa which he has transferred.      The Committee are, however, of opinion that it is undesirable so to modify existing contracts and they cannot therefore recommend the Cabinet to entertain this proposal.pllg PROPOSED IhlBUjMI.17 .     It remains to consider tho nature of the tribunal to which questions arising under the proposed legislation should be referred.     Having regard to the wide powers, proposed to be conferred upon it,  it is essential that the tribunal should command public confidence and. should be capable of dealing with its work cheaply, quickly mid. impartially.     After   considering various alternative suggestions the Committee are disposed to give the preference to a tribunal on the lines of that prescribed in Section 8 of the Defence of the Heaim (Acquisition of Land) Act, 1916, Section 8, -that is to say, to a tribunal consisting of a single member of a panel of referees to be appointed in like manner as the panel appointed under Part I of the Pinaneo (1909/10) Act, 1910, such member tp be selected, in case of difference, by tha Reference-10-
Commit toe under Section 33 &quot;of that Act.      It may he, however, that some of. the questions to be decided under the proposea Act (such as the  question of compensation for &amp; valuable goodwill) would be too important to be entrusted to a single rcferaa for decision, and that in these cases (which -would.be defined by the Act) cither party should have the right to have the matter referred to the County Court Judgev      In either case, the decision of the tribunal on questions of fact to be final, a right to appeal being given on points of Lav; only.CLOWN PEOPtRTY18*      The surveyors Institution regard it as essential that there should be no exception for the Crown, and that any legislation affecting tho leasehold system should apply tc Crown property equally with that bolong-ing to other public bodies or corporations or individuals v/hile it would bo difficult to establish and maintain exemption of Crown property from any general legislation, the Committee foel that this is a matter which must be reserved for decision after consultation with the Crown  authorities.   .19 . The Committee submit the following recommendations to the Cabinet  :-(l)    That proposals for -(a) Leasehold Jitof ranch! sera en t;    or for(b) Giving leaseholders a right of renewal at the end of the termshould In no circumstances be entertained.
(2)    That with a view to meeting the legitimategrievances of tenants in respect of improve-ments, loss of goodwill and onerous covenants and restrictions, general approval should he given to tha various proposals set out in Paragraphs 6 to 17 inclusive of this iio oort.(3)    That the Supporters of the Town Tenants Bill ha informed that, while tha Government cannot undertake to give facilities for that Bill, they propose to introduce legislation on the subject next year.Signed on behalf of the Committee.CAVE ,CSA IRIAN.2 Whit eh*j 11 Gardens , S . v,r. 1. 15th June,  1926.
