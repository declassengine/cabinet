DQCUKBHT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;3 GOVERNMENT-).CRET. Copy No.     3 &amp;P^g3g (86).CABINET.POflER ALCOHOL FROM SUGAR BEET. Memorandum by ibe Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.During the discussion on Agricultural Policy at the meeting of the Cabinet on the 15th April, 1926, I Informed the Cabinet that I had appointed a small expert committee to examine the question of the production of power alcohol from sugar beet, and the Cabinet agreed to await the report of the committee before considering the question further.I now circulate a copy of this report.The application made by the British Power Alcohol Association waa that the existing subsidy on home grown beet-sugar should be made available on the same basis for alcohol production from sugar beet.     The subsidy on home grown sugar is at the rate of 19/6d. per cwt. until 1927-8;    13/- per cwt. from 1928-9 to 1931-4j   and 6/.6d. per cwt. until 1934-5. Account, however, should be taken of the Excise Duty, which reduces the net rate of Government assistance to the industry to 12/l2/3d. per owt. during the first period;   to 5/V2/sd. per cwt. in the second period, while during the third period the amount of the subsidy is less than the Excise Duty.The Report lends no support to the belief that the production,of power alcohol would be a profitable undertaking at the present time, even with the assistance of the generous subsidy proposed.     Future prospects, while to some extent uncertain, are no more promising that the industry will ultimately be self-supporting.     Briefly, the position is as follows.     With beets at 54/- per ten (the price which farmers generally are receiving from the beet sugar factories)/the
the cost of producing a gallon of alcohol ,would he 3/5-gd., without reckoning cost for denaturation, packages, transport and selling charges.     The selling price of alcohol may be taken as the same as that of petrol, I.e, 1/Sd. per gallon. A subsidy at the rate of 12/l2/sd. per cwt, on sugar is equivalent to l/9^d, per gallon on alcohol, making a total receipt of 3/3fd. per gallon as against an expenditure considerably in excess of 3/5-gd. per gallon.     Consequently, with a subsidy even greater than the selling price, power alcohol co.uld not be produced from sugar beet at a profit.The Power Alcohol Association estimate that at the end of the subsidy period about 2o distilleries would be operating, producing over 1,000,000 gallons of alcohol a year from sugar beet.     This estimate is based on the expectation that the subsidy would be equivalent to the gross subsidy under the British Sugar (Subsidy) Act, i.e. without deduction of Excise Duty.     At that rate the total cost of the subsidy to the Exchequer during the subsidy period would be about  10,000,000.     At the net rate of subsidy the cost would be reduced to between  5,000,000 and  7,000,000.The consumption of petrol in this country is about 400,00.0,000 gallons per armura.So far as the agricultural aspect Is concerned, farmers would of course welcome an increased, demand for one of their erops, but to encourage farmers to grow sugar beet specifically for the production of alcohol would be to direct their energies into uneconomic channels.The following figures are of interest in this connection:-/ (K-C
One ton of sugar- beet produces sugar worth 70/-.One ton of sugar beet, used as a feeding stuff, increases the live weight of a pig to the value of 46/-.One ton of sugar beet produces alcohol worth 35/-.To grow other crops, such as cereals or potatoes, for alcohol would be even more unattractive to farmers, and alcohol production from these sources would have to depend upon occasional supplies of spoiled grain, or in the case of potatoes, to gluts during, seasons of over-production.In all the circumstances the propo sa 1 t or a subsidy on power alcohol from sugar beet is not one which I can recommend the Cabinet to adopt.9/6/26.Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries.

Our terms of reference instructed us to consider the tech-nical questions involved in the manufacture of alcohol for power purposes from sugar beet and to report upon -(a) the probable cost of production of alcohol from sugar beet at a given price per ton;(6) the value of alcohol for power purposes as compared with petrol and benzol and the comparative price at which it could be sold in competition with these fuels;(c) the quantity of alcohol that should be regarded as equivalent to 1 cwt. of sugar, should the Government decide to accord some assistance to the industry;(d) the prospects of. alcohol production by synthetic processes.x   (5)20433   Wt 24 70-2S5   100   0/26   E &amp; S
2. We have held three meetings and have had the advantage of hearing evidence from Sir Frederic Nathan, of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, and Sir Daniel Hall, of the Ministry of Agriculture, who were good enough to place at our disposal their technical knowledge on the various aspects of the question, and we also received evidence from Mr. Ben h. Morgan, of the British Power Alcohol Association, who put before us very fully and frankly the general case of the Association, and in this way he supplemented the information with regard to the Associa-tion&apos;s application with which we had had an opportunity of acquainting ourselves from the official files of the Ministry of Agriculture,3. The result of our investigation is as follows :  (a) (1) The- cost of raw material, referred to a gallon of alcohol, after allowing for the value of residual products, should be taken as 5 per cent, of the price per ton of beet.(2) Manufacturing cost, i.e., the total cost of conversion, should be put at the rate of 9d. per gallon.Thus, with sugar beet at  1 and  2 per ton respectively, the cost per gallon of 95 per cent, alcohol net naked at works would be Is. 9d, and 2s. 9d. respectively.(3) In addition, there are costs due .to denaturation, packages, transport and selling charges.(6) For use in internal combustion engines of present design, one gallon of 95 per cent, alcohol is equivalent to less than three-quarters of a gallon of petrol. It is possible that if the situation is skilfully handled from the commercial point of view, a market for a moderate quantity of fuel alcohol at approximately the same price as petrol might be secured.(c) The theoretical yield of 95 per cent, alcohol from 1 cwt. of sucrose is eight gallons. Of this 85 per cent, can be obtained in good practice, so that the practical yield would be 6 - 8 gallons of 95 per cent, alcohol from 1 cwt. of sucrose.(d) The present position with regard to the production of alcohol by synthetic processes is obscure, but the effect of the development of such processes would undoubtedly be to exercise a restraining control on the price of petrol and other materials. It should be borne in mind that the production of other fuels, by synthetic or other means, suitable for use in internal combustion engines will have a similar effect in controlling prices.Neither for the production of synthetic alcohol nor for sub-stitute hydrocarbon fuels can it be expected that a reliable statement as to costs will be available for a few years.4. The above afford answers to the specific questions which our terms of reference asked us to determine. In the following appendices a, B, C and D, corresponding to terms of reference (a), (6), (c) and (d) will be found some elaboration of these points.
We attach also, for purposes of reference, additional appendices E, F* and G, embodying the substance of the evidence which was given before us by Mr. Ben Morgan on behalf of the British Power Alcohol Association (Appendix E) and detailed informa-tion with regard to an ether alcohol mixture known as Natalite to which Mr. Morgan referred* (Appendices F and G).5. Since in our terms of reference the possibility is indicated of Government assistance, we have made in Appendix C an approximate comparison between the proportion which a sug-gested assistance would bear to the commercial price of alcohol and the proportion which the present assistance bears to that of sugar.6. Finally, we wish to acknowledge the assistance of our Secretary, Mr. H. H. Parker, of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, in regard to the work of the Committee.We are, Sir,Your obedient Servants,(Signed)   ROBERT ROBERTSON(Chairman).(Signed)   J. E. PETAVEL.

Walter Guinness, M.P., Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.* Appendices F and G which relate to &quot; Natalite &quot; are not printed. Examination of the data supplied by Mr. Ben Morgan with regard to this mixture resulted in the following conclusion  -&quot; Scientific tests and computations from calorific values, thermal efficiencies, etc., indicate that 1 gallon of Natalite three-quarters of a gallon of petrol.&quot; Road tests appear to indicate equality of consumption, but the results are of uncertain value unless mixture strength is taken into consideration and the whole mixture-strength range explored.&quot; a   20483 B
APPENDIX A.PROBABLE COST OP THE PRODUCTION OP ALCOHOL PROM sugar BEETS AT A GIVEN PRICE PER TON.Cost for raw material, allowing for value of residual products, ssay, 5 per cent, of price per ton of beet.Manufacturing cost (total cost of conversion), Qd. per gallon.Thus, with sugar beets at  1 and  2 per ton respectively, the cost per gallon of 95 per cent, alcohol net naked at works, would be Is. 9(j. and 2s. 9d. respectively. In addition, there are costs due to denaturation, packages, transport and selling charges.In arriving at the figure for the cost for raw materials, more or less arbitrary assumptions have to be made as to the sugar contents of the beet, and as to the actual net credit to be derived from residual materials. Such credits obviously will vary not Only with market prices, but -with costs of transport.It appears that a reasonable assumption, and cost estimates can never be more and often fail to attain to such a standard, would be to charge Is. per gallon of alcohol for each  1 paid for beets.As regards manufacturing cost, i.e., total cost of conversion, it appears reasonable to take a figure of 9d. per gallon. Based on Continental practice, lower figures have been suggested, and if the whole question at issue is vitally affected by a possible error of lei!, to 2d. a gallon, it would be desirable to take advantage of the offer made by the promoter of the scheme, and make a detailed investigation on the spot.In the present disturbed state of Continental currency, however, it is exceedingly difficult to arrive at a correct comparison between the cost of even staple articles which are also manufactured in this country. Almost invariably what appear to be fair and reasonable currency adjustments, mutually agreed with friendly and helpful Continental manufacturers, fail to show the extent of the higher production costs prevalent under present conditions in this country, as compared with France, Belgium, Italy and Germany.APPENDIX B (1).NOTE ON THE VALUE OP ALCOHOL FOR POWER PURPOSES as COMPARED WITH PETROL AND BENZOL AND THE c0mpara-TIVE PRICE AT WHICH IT COULD BE SOLD IN COMPETITION WITH THESE FUELS.I. For use in internal combustion engines of present design, one gallon of 95 per cent, alcohol is equivalent to less than three-quarters of a gallon of petrol.2. With alcohol as a fuel, higher compression ratios are possible, and higher thermal efficiencies are obtainable, but the full realisation of these advantages demands an engine of special design,3. Mixtures of alcohol with benzol, petrol, ether and other fuels arc in use in this country and abroad, and the power per unit volume obtained may in some cases not be less than that obtained from petrol.4. Arguments, numerous and plausible, can be brought forward in favour of and against the use of such mixtures.It is&apos; possible that if the situation is skilfully handled, from a commercial point of view, a market for a moderate quantity of fuel alcohol at approximately the same price as petrol might be secured.
NOTE ON THE WORK CARRIED OUT BY Mr. H, R. RICARDO, PARTLY FOR THE BRITISH EMPIRE MOTOR FUELS COM-MITTEE, PARTLY FOR THE ASIATIC PETROLEUM COMPANY.(See Institution of Automobile Engineers Proceedings, Volume XVHI.)1. Relative Fuel Consumption.Mr. Rieardo&apos;s tests were carried out on a single cylinder variable compression engine and also on a four-cylinder Leyland lorry engine  both were tested on the bench. All petrols used do not give the same power output, and. therefore in making a comparison with alcohol the brand of petrol is specified. On his variable compression engine Mr. Ricardo has tested many petrols and he gives results for no less than ten and of these the best and worst have been selected.(a) Ricardo&apos;s Sim/lie Cylinder Engine Results at 5 to 1 compression mtio.Minimum Consumption in Pints Fuel. per I.H.P. per Hour.Petrol A......-   0-442Petrol F       -      -      -       -       -       -       -   0-471Benzene (pure)     ------   0-415Ethyl alcohol (95 vol. per cent.)    -       -       -   0-692 From which Ethyl alcohol (95 vol. per cent.) consumption _ 0-692 _ j .gg Petrol A consumption. 0-442Ethyl alcohol (95 vol. per cent.) consumption     0-692 _j.47Petrol F consumption. 0-471Ethyl alcohol (95 vol. per cent.) consumption _ 0-692 _ 1.(57Benzene consumption. 0-415Some of the petrols tested would not run at a 5 to I compression ratio; petrol F is the worst of those that were capable of being run at this compression.(b) Ricardo&apos;s Single Cylinder Engine results when compression ratio was adjusted to the highest useful value for each fuel.Fuel.

Incidentally, it may be noted that alcohol and benzol will both take a much higher compression pressure than petrol. The highest useful compression ratio for petrol I was probably about 4i, compared with about 7 for benzene and 7  or more for alcohol. Petrol A contained a large proportion of aromatics and naphthenes thus accounting for the compression ratio of 6.(c) Ricardo&apos;s four-cylinder Leyland lorry engine tests, compression ratio 4-24 to 1.Load.

,Tt. appears, therefore, that when first put on the market alcohol would have to be sold considerably below the price of petrol and benzol. Later, when experience with the fuel had led to improvement in engine design, the relative price might improve. The high compression engine figures are not likely to be realised, since it is improbable that engines in general would be built with compression ratios of the order of 7 to 1, even if a suitable fuel were available : and, further, the progress made in the &quot; doping &quot; of petrol opens out the possibility of that fuel eventually competing with alcohol even at high compression ratios.2. Relative Power Output.Mr. Ricardo has shown that under favourable conditions the thermal efficiency with alcohol is some 2  per cent, greater than that with petrol and benzol, and that the maximum power output and the normal power output are also considerably greater the effect being due to the high latent heat of the fuel content of the mixture.3. Starting and General Running.Ease of starting depends on the volatility of the fuel, and since alcohol has a much lower vapour pressure (at atmospheric temperatures) than either petrol or benzol, starting difficulties will be experienced. So low, indeed, is the vapour pressure of ethyl alcohol that it requires a temperature of 25&quot; C. to form the weakest explosive mixture at atmospheric pressure. Mr. Ricardo states that &quot; the temperature at which &apos; starting &apos; is possible will be appreciably lowered by the presence of 10 to 15 per cent, of ether in the alcohol mixture. With such a small proportion of ether, however, it is not possible with most carburettors to start the engine from cold.&quot; As to the general behaviour of the single-cylinder engine when running on ethyl alcohol, Mr. Ricardo remarks that &quot; at all times and under all conditions the running of the engine was noticeably sweeter and smoother than on petrol, and this applies even to the highest compression ratio used, namely, 7 : 1, corresponding to a compression pressure of approxi-mately 185 lbs. per square inch.&quot;Alcohol is a very clean burning fuel, and is in this respect greatly superior to benzol. As to corrosion when using alcohol, Dr. W. R. Ormandy went into this matter very thoroughly when on the Continent, &quot; where were seen a number of alcohol engines some of which had been running 12 to 16 hours per day for periods up to eight years without showing the slightest sign of corrosion which could be attributed to acid production.&quot; &apos; With alcohol, precautions have to be taken as to the metals used for tanks, carburettors, etc., and the addition of pyridine bases has been found to have a beneficial effect in reducing corrosive action.APPENDIX C.THE QUANTITY OF ALCOHOL THAT SHOULD BE REGARDED AS EQUIVALENT TO ONE CWT. OF SUGAR, SHOULD THE GOVERN-MENT DECIDE TO ACCORD SOME ASSISTANCE TO THE INDUSTRY.(a) Theoretical yield of alcohol from sucrose = 53-8% by weight. 53-8 X 112 = 60-25 lb. absolute alcohol per cwt. sucrose. 60-25 = 7-59 galls, absolute alcohol.(0-7936 = specific gravity of absolute alcohol.) 7-59 X 100 = 8-0 galls. 95% alcohol from 1 cwt. of sucrose.Practical yield, say 85% (Simmonds says 83%, Monier Williams 84-85 from starch).8 X 85% s 6-8 galls. 95% alcohol from 1 cwt. of sucrose. x  26433 0
The theoretical yield of 95. per cent, alcohol from 1 cwt. of sucrose, therefore, is eight gallons. Of this, 85 per cent, can be obtained in good practice, so that the practical yield would be 6-8 gallons of 95 per cent, alcohol from 1 cwt. of sucrose.(b) The relative positions of home-grown sugar and power alcohol in respect of Government assistance which would arise if the application of the British Power Alcohol Association for a subsidy for alcohol production were allowed (see Mr. Morgahs evidence, Appendix E) would appear to be as follows : Sugar       -   Commercial price 28s. per cwt.(Subsidy (net) = 12s. Id. per cwt. or 43% of commercial price.Subsidy (gross) = 19s. 6d. per cwt. or 70% of commercial price.Alcohol - Commercial price assume the same price as petrol = (a) Is. 6d. to (b) 2s. per gallon. Subsidy = 19s. (id, per cwt. of sugar or 2s. lOJrf. per gallon which represents 191% of commercial price if taken at Is. Gd. per gallon or 144% of commercial price if taken at 2s. per gallon.APPENDIX D.THE PROSPECTS OP ALCOHOL PRODUCTION BY SYNTHETICPROCESSES.In the following notes various processes are reviewed as to the present position of their capability of producing power alcohol, and on account of its bearing on the home production of liquid fuels reference is made to the production of hydrocarbon oils from coal.Processes  or Production of Alcohol.From Coal.Through ethylene. Through carbide. Through water gas.From Wood.Amerioan methods. Improved Classen method. Prodor method. Sulphite process.From Other Cellulosic Materials.Processes for Production of other Liquid Fuels.Low-Temperature Carbonisation Process. Bergius Process.Summary. Processes for Production of Alcohol.From Coal.Through ethylene. The preparation of alcohol from ethylene consists in absorbing the gas in sulphuric acid containing suitable catalysts and the subsequent hydrolysis of the ethyl sulphuric acid.
This process was tried at Skinningrove Iron and Steel Works during the War and is described in Chemical Trade Journal, 66, 36, 61, (1919). It is not considered economical at the present time on account of the cost of reconcentrating the diluted sulphuric acid. The modification of the method by which the ethylene was absorbed by charcoal did not turn out a technical success.The latest attempt to obtain ethyl alcohol from ethylene is being made by the &quot; Compagnie des Mines cle Bethune,&quot; where the ethylene is liquefied from coke-oven gas in conjunction with their synthetic ammonia plant (Claude). The ethylene is absorbed in sulphuric acid, and ammonia is added which forms ammonium sulphate and ethyl alcohol. (Chemie et Industrie, May 1925).It has been stated that this Company is putting up plant to produce 100,000 or possibly later, 300,000 gallons of alcohol a week.It may be said that the Gas Companies would probably not consider elimination of ethylene from their illuminating gas, and that the propor-tion of ethylene in a coke-oven gas is small, being about 1 - 6 per cent, in gas from Durham coal, but very much less than this in coal from the Welsh fields.Another process for obtaining ethylene of which little is known is by heating an emulsion of coal, water and oil at S00o (Am. Gas J., 115, 143, 148, 1921, and Chem. Met. Eng. 27, 1087, 1922).It seems unlikely, that any large amount of alcohol will be produced in this country from ethylene even although it should be removed from gas in conjunction with nitrogen fixation processes.Through carbide. The production of acetaldehyde and of acetic acid from acetylene by adding water to carbide is conducted on a large scale and with little technical difficulty at Shawinigan, Province of Quebec. The reduction of acetaldehyde to ethyl alcohol can be effected by hydro-hydrogenation in the presence of a catalyst or by electrolytic reduction. The former is conducted by the Lonza Company which is said to use about two tons of carbide to produce a ton of alcohol, requiring 11,000 kw. hours of electrical energy. The electrolytic reduction of acetaldehyde, on the other hand, has received most attention from French investigators.As the production of carbide in this country has been abandoned on economical grounds, there seems little chance of alcohol being made here by this method.Through water gas. Processes for the production of liquid fuels, including alcohols, have been worked out in France by M. Patart (Bull. Soc. of February, 1925), in Germany by Fischer (Brennstoff Chemie, 4, 1923), and the Badische Anilin und Soda Fabrik, and a similar process is mentioned in an English Patent, Lush, No. 180016, of 12th February, 1921. They involve heating carbon monoxide and hydrogen under pressure in the presence of a catalyst under conditions somewhat similar to those for the production of ammonia by heating nitrogen and hydrogen under pressure in the presence of a catalyst.There exist possibilities of the process being taken up in this country. So far only methyl alcohol and that of high purity has been produced commercially in Germany, but continuous work is going on to modify the process so &quot;that propyl and higher alcohols are formed. These would make excellent motor fuels, and in this connection it is remarkable that ethyl alcohol seems to escape formation.It is too early to say whether liquid fuels can be obtained from water gas by this method to compete with petrol. The methyl alcohol, which is the most readily obtained so far, is claimed to be possible as a fuel on the strength of French trials, but on the other hand it is held to have certain disadvantages, such as the formation of objectionable products on account of incomplete combustion.There would seem to be, however, great possibilities for the production or liquid fuels, whether they be alcohols or hydrocarbons, by these synthetic processes.   They are, however, in their infancy in this country.
From Wood.American methods. The production of alcohol from wood waste and low-grade wood has occupied the attention for many years of technical chemists in America and in Canada where such products abound. No great success seems to have attended these efforts in the direction of any large-scale production. An estimate given in U.S. Dept. of Agile. Bulletin, No. 983, 1922, gives the cost of the production of alcohol by a process which gives a yield of 20 gallons a dry ton, with sulphuric acid and lime reasonably near, an installation producing three thousand gallons a day, and with wood at 40 cents for 1,800 pounds, as 8d. a bulk gallon. There is no such large source of waste wood in this country, so that any method used here must ensure a much larger yield of wood sugar from the original wood.Improved Classen method. It has been stated that one of the American processes, the Classen process, has been improved by the use of tungsten filaments as a catalyst in conjunction with strong hydrochloric acid, so that 65 gallons of alcohol may be obtained from a ton of wood, but this confessedly has only been done on the small scale.Prodor method. This process originated in Geneva (British Pats. Nos. 143212 (1921) and 186139 (1922) ). Sawdust and wood chips are heated with strong hydrochloric acid producing about 600 kilos, of sugar per ton of dry wood, which is equivalent to nearly-80 gallons of 95 per cent, alcohol.The corrosion of the plant due to the hydrochloric acid and the recovery of the hydrochloric acid, which presented considerable difficulties, are now stated to have been overcome.It will probably be a process that will come into practice where wood is available and cheap, and so it might be considered as a source of wood molasses from Norway and Sweden, for example, for fermentation in this country.From Sulphite Process.Alcohol is made in Germany from waste liquors from the treatment of wood by the sulphite process. The quantity produced in 1921 was 1,500,000 gallons, but a certain quota only is allowed to be made in coin-petition with fermentation alcohol; during the same year the output capacity was stated to be approximately 4 - 8 million gallons from 11 distilleries. The process has also been developed in Sweden, where in 1921 there were 21 distilleries in operation, with an output capacity of about 8,000,000 gallons; in 1924 there were 22 distilleries. Between 1918 and 1921 four factories were set up in Norway, with an output capacity of 3,500,000 gallons, but none started, as the sulphite alcohol could not compete with imported petrol as fuel.As little wood is treated by the sulphite process in this country, there is no prospect that any considerable supply of alcohol could be obtained from this source.From other Cellulosic Materials.The question of the production of alcohol from cellulosic materials has been studied at the Bacteriological Department of the Royal Naval Cordite Factory, Dorset, for the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research.The mechanism of the acid hydrolysis of cellulose to ensure the maxi-mum production of carbohydrates has been worked out on a semi-technical scale, using wheat and rice straws, and grasses from South and West Africa. The method of acid hydrolysis adopted consists in steaming the acidified material at 100&quot; C. at normal pressure.The fermentation of pentoses by this treatment produces an alcohol-acetone liquid in the proportion of about 90 per cent, of alcohol to 10 per cent, acetone.
How far the production of alcohol on these lines could be established in the Empire Overseas on a commercial basis is a matter which depends obviously on a great number of local conditions, which it is intended to study as soon as the process has been fully worked out; it would not appear-, however, to be a likely source of any considerable quantity of alcohol in this country.So far as any of the above processes that might be carried out in this country are concerned, that from water gas, and that from wood in which a very high yield of wood sugar can be obtained, alone possess any likelihood-hood of assisting the liquid fuel situation by the production of alcohols.Processes Sor Production of other Liquid Fuels.For the production of motor fuels, not necessarily alcohols, relief may come from the scientific treatment of coal.Important experiments are now being made in two directions with a view to converting a far larger proportion of coal into liquid fuel:  (re) the destructive distillation of coal at a lower tenvperature than is employed for the production of coal gas; j(6) the Bergius Process, which consists in heating coal in the presence of hydrogen.The Loio-Temperature Carbonisation Process produces from one ton of coal 14. cwt. of low-temperature coke, and 15 gallons of oil, and some 3,000 or more cubic feet of gas of high calorific value, from which about 1J gallons of light spirit suitable for the manufacture of light fuel can be recovered by means of gas scrubbing. The 15 gallons of oil may be relied upon to give \\ gallons of light oils in large scale operations. This light fuel is suitable for use as a motor spirit practically as it stands, and with a little purification is exceptionally good for use in high-com-pression engines. Of the remainder of the 15 gallons comparatively little is known in detail, and investigations are now in process. From certain fractions of crude oil obtained in the &quot; L. &amp; N.&quot; process, Mr. Harold Nielson has recently prepared various lubricating oils of good quality.The commercial position is that there is no evidence to show that any scheme of low-temperature carbonisation can be worked on a large scale at a profit, though the contrary has not yet been proved. It will probably take at least two years to reach a definite conclusion as to whether any scheme can be run at a profit or what the loss would be. Even if such a scheme were a success it could not provide anything like all the heavy and light oil required in this country. Its value lies largely in other products.Bergius Process.--The experiments on the Bergius process are being conducted in Germany, but when these experiments have reached a slightly more advanced stage there is a prospect that experiments on a larger scale may be undertaken here.By the Bergius process 65 per cent, of the weight of the coal may be converted into a kind of oil, 25 per cent, of which is a light fuel which should be very suitable for internal-combustion engines. The process involves the burning of at least a ton of coal for every ton put through the process. It may, therefore, be said that an amount up to 7 per cent, of the coal used becomes light fuel say 15 gallons per ton. The crude oil resulting from the process is very like natural crude oil, and a lubricating oil has been produced which is expected to give good results, though it has not yet been tested on the full scale.This is the only process involving the direct treatment of eoal from which it would be possible to produce all the supplies of oil needed in this country, but on the question of cost it is not yet possible even to venture an opinion. In view of the difficulty in the construction of plant, it is unlikely that any results yielding really commercial data could be available before, say, four or five years-.
Summary.-So far as production of power alcohol in this country is concerned, the most hopeful processes not involving the distillation of fermented food-stuffs, are those from water-gas by leading steam over hot coke, and from wood by a method ensuring a high yield of fermentable sugar. These, however, are only in the experimental stage in this country, and their economic production has to be proved.In addition, processes for treating ooal are being investigated, and one or other of them may afford a supply of liquid hydrocarbon fuel. - It will be a few years before a definite statement can be mado as regards cost.APPENDIX E.POWER ALCOHOL COMMITTEE. Second Meeting 22nd February, 1926.* * * tklieMr. Morgans Evidence.(1) Mr. Morgan first made the point that the area of land required to grow beet for alcohol was much less than the economical minimum for growing beet for sugar. Two thousand five hundred acres would suffice for a distillery as against 10,000 aores for a sugar-beet factory. The smaller area required corrld be obtained more readily; carriage to the factory is much less and this is an important item. Beets would come in by road and wet pulp returned by the same vans. This pulp would be used in equal quantities with beet tops and should equal in &quot;weight washed beets supplied to the distillery; the value of this pulp and beet tops is equal to mangold, i.c, from 61. to 81. an acre. His con-tention is that the distillery is a more effective agent for helping agriculture than the sugar-beet factory. Questioned as to other raw materials as sources for alcohol, Mr. Morgan said that there would be a certain amount of damaged grain coming from shiploads, and surplus potatoes if contracted for in advance at a fixed price, say from 30s. to 40s. per ton, would tend to increase production with the knowledge that any surplus could be sold, and home-grown beet molasses within the 10 beet-sugar factories would probably produce one million gallons of alcohol per annum. Imported molasses he did not think were available: they were already in the hands of oil combines. Sugar beet he regarded as having a dual utility; it could be mamvfactured into sugar or alcohol as price dictated, a method generally adopted on the Continent.(2) Mr. Morgan pointed out that the British Power Alcohol Association was not interested in any particular form of alcohol fuel, but genorally in the provision of fuel suitable for all motor purposes. Mr. Morgan, however, went on to describe an alcohol ether mixture known as &quot; Natalite,&quot; one of the many fuels under consideration which he himself, from practical experience, was very favourable to. Natalite consists of 40 per cent, ether, 60 per cent, alcohol, and with a 0 - 5 per cent, of castor oil which inhibits corrosion. It may either by sold by itself, when it requires a slightly larger jet for the carburettor, or it may be sold as a 50 per cent./50 per cent, mixture with petrol. He stated that between three and four million gallons are produced annually, of which about two millions are produced in South Africa, where it is made from molasses. It is made from sugar cane in East Africa, from molasses in Italy and Angola, and from molasses and cassava in Australia.   In South Africa
the price of petrol ia 2s. 9d. per gallon, but natalite sells from 3d. to 6d. cheaper. The &quot; fifty-fifty mixture is 2s. 2d. a gallon. Two and a-quarter millions of 95 per cent, alcohol give two million gallons of ether.(3) Mr. Morgan expressed the opinion that the existing stills in this country are not up to date and could not advantageously be used commercially for the manufacture of power alcohol, and in proof of this he pointed out that during the early part of the War large quantities of natalite were imported from Natal by the Government for the manu-facture of munitions until modern stills could be erected for this purpose in munition areas. He considers that the fermentation of sugar from beets and the distillation of the fermented product must go on continuously. This is in order to prevent the beets from spoiling, and necessitates the concentration of alcohol production from beet into about 100 days a year. He thought that the continuous process was absolutely essential for power alcohol production. In view of the fact that distilleries are now working on a non-continuous process, he would propose to confine the use of the continuous process to the production of power alcohol only, whether produced from beet or other materials. Mr. Morgan would rather abandon the Excise drawback of 8d. per bulk gallon, which is at present available to alcohol producers under certain conditions, in order to get continuous fermentation and distillation, but he considers that a portion of this 8d. should be available for power alcohol producers.Mr. Morgan went on to describe methods for the production of alcohol from wood. He mentioned a process which he regards as most promising for the production of alcohol, which appears to be a modification of the Classen process in which ECL is used with tungsten filaments as a catalyst. He said that 60 per cent, conversion had been obtained, or 65 gallons per ton of wood, but it had only been done on a small scale. He thought the method was quite practicable in this country, and he mentioned in this connection that he knew of at least 40 sawmills which were capable of producing 50 tons of sawdust and sawmill waste a day, which would represent about a million gallons of alcohol per sawmill a year. In Italy rice husks are used, 85 gallons per ton being obtained. Seventy per cent, of the HCL can be recovered, so that the success of the process to some extent depends on cheap HCL.(4) Mr. Calder put forward a formula to arrive at the cost of raw material per gallon of alcohol produced viz., beets at 20s. a ton represent a net cost of Is. per gallon of alcohol and so on in arithmetical pro-progression. He put purely manufacturing costs at 9d. Mr. Morgan regarded these manufacturing costs as on the high side, and thought that Sd. should cover these. At the same time he did not offer very strong opposition to taking 9d. as a basis for argument. He would hope to write off entirely the value of the plant during the period of subsidy, and they wanted also the protection of the subsidy to enable them to experiment on manufacturing alcohol from other materials than sugar beet in the remainder of the year.(5) Mr. Morgan then touched on the production of discol at the Hammersmith Distillery. Sixty thousand gallons were produced last year, but sold at a loss. He explained that the Distillers&apos; Company have an interest in alcohol production and have borne the loss in order to keep themselves in the industry. He referred again to the fact that molasses were controlled by the Oil Trust. He said that the price of molasses was il. 10s. a ton at present, compared with 21. a ton five years ago. By far the greater proportion of the world&apos;s supply is manufactured by the Oil Trust into alcohol; in Baltimore it amounts to 100 million gallons of aviation and power spirit a year. A very small amount of molasses (probably about only 0-5 per cent.) was used for feeding material.(6) Mr. Morgan appeared confident that the industry would be firmly established after the subsidy period, and would be able to maintain itself.   His point of view rather was that alcohol would take the place
of benzol, which was very difficult to obtain except in small quantities, owing to the restricted supplies which were tending to decline, and which now constituted only about 3 per cent, of the consumption of petrol. Alcohol would always be valuable as an antiknock material, and he con-sidered that alcohol would always keep the price of benzol, which he stated was always 6d. over petrol.With regard to the probable supplies of petrol and the prospect of a future rise in price, the Chairman reminded Mr. Morgan of the large amount of motor fuel produced by cracking heavy oils. Some discussion took place with regard to the thermal efficiency of ether alcohol mixture. Mr. Morgan promised to send the results of practical tests which had been made with the different materials. He thought that in a few years&apos; time the process of manufacturing alcohol from sugar beet would be supplemented by wood saccharification processes and might, in the course of years, be superseded, but in the meantime he thought that the industry would be valuable from an agricultural point of view, and it would achieve the great work of developing in this country the nucleus of a power alcohol industry. The amount of the subsidy for which they were making application was 19s. 6d. per cwt of sugar. He considered that for the future processes of making alcohol other than synthetic were more likely and stated that in Germany use of methyl alcohol had been abandoned as a fuel for motor engines. There are, however, French experiments in the contrary sense. He considered that a mixture of ether and alcohol was a very advantageous mixture for running, but the mixture of ether and methyl alcohol was not good.
