Memorandum by Secretary for Mines.I annex a memorandum on the question of importing foreign coal on Government Account to maintain essential services  (as was dons in 1921).The position Is, briefly, this.      If we knew that the stoppage would end before the end of June there would be no need to import coal.      But  if we are to insure  (as I think we ought)  against essential services breaking down by a prolongation of the  stoppage beyond that date, we can only do It by giving orders for coal now.      It will be seen from the memorandum that the proposal made In it may,  if the stoppage ends by the end of June,  Involve xxs in a loss of  400,000.      It Is a heavy Insurance premium to have to pay, but 1 think we must face it.This memorandum will be  considered by the Supply and Transport Committee on Tuesday,  1st June, and will probably be referred to the Cabinet meeting on the following day.   .(Intld).

GOAL STOPPAGE 19.26. - -Importation of coal., fram ..abroad..In view of the possibility of a long ^-toppe^e ^rfrork- ixT the raining industry,  the question of importing coal from abroad to maintain services necessary to life arises.Coal stocks are generally satisfactory, much more so than in the case of the 1921 stoppage.    On a cautious estimate some ten million tons of coal are available in the country ape.rt from stocks held in private cellars.   Weekly consumption, apart from further restrictions,  ie estimated at 1,200,000 tons but this can be considerably reduced.    (In 1921 weekly con-sumption was down to 900,000 tons in the fifth week of the stoppage ana to 600, 000 tons in the last week.)In addition to coal there are large supplies of oil, .coke-and wood and we may expect a steadily increasing use of such substitutes,StockB are of course patchy,  and shortages will arise in various places very soon, but these can generally be dealt with by special arrangements. *There should be no possibility of a breakdown of vital services for lack of fuel in the next six or seven weeks.   We must, however,  see that a minimum of two weeks&apos; stock ia available for carrying on when the strike terminates.It follows,   if it is desired to insure against a long stoppage,   that we should try to have foreign coal available from abroad at end of June/beginning July,    For this it will be necessary to place orders practically at once as the only  : certain aource of supply for satisfactory coal in large quantities i3 the U.S.A, and Canada.It is considered undesirable at present to try to buy coal on the Continent,  as difficulties have already arisen there in bunkering British ships and an attempt to ship coal cargoes to England might well provoke a general embargo on all coal forBriti sh/
British ships.      Apart from the fact that it is necessary to bunker our chips abroad during the stoppage, a general refusal there to handle coal for Britain or for British ships might cause difficulties with dockers and railway men here when foreign coal from any source arrives,,If it is decided to Import coal it is suggested, that authority be given to purchase 400 , 000 tons from U.S.A, and Canada for delivery end June/beginning July.      The action taken would be to buy 200,000 tons at once and then consider the situation on the Continent again.      By the time 200,000 tons are bought it will be known that the Government Is buying and It may be possible to estimate the attitude of Continental labour.      If this is satisfactory the poss-responsibility of buying there satisfactory qualities and quantities would be again examined before making further purchases In America,For deliveries later In July,  subject to what may be done by private enterprise, we shall need to import at the rate of 200,000 tons a week, and for/iater dellveres we may have to try to secure still larger quantities,     But our experience in 1921 was that estimates of stocks were always below and estimates of consumption above the actual * It Is impossible closely to estimate the effects of substitution end abstinence.     The question of such further purchases will be brought up at a later date.Coal imported by Government would be supplied only to public utilities, food-producing concerns and domestic consumers unless the emergency ceased ?/hen the coal would have to be disposed of In any way possible.If difficulties are placed by labour in the way of the discharge and movement of Government imported coal use will have to be made of volunteer labour end the question of protection may arise.
Prioae may be estimated roughly at :-U.S.A. &amp; Canada 40/- o.i.f.Germany 32/-     &quot;France 32/-     &quot;They will probably riae steadily.The cost of 400,000 tons bought In U.S.A. and Canada, apart from delays at discharging ports, would be approximately  300,000 and it is impossible to say what the loss on sale would be.     We should endeavour to sell either at cost or market prioe whichever is the higher, but this may not be generally practicable and if the stoppage ends, will be impossible.     In the latter case the loss might be as much as  1 per ton.It appears undesirable on grounds both of finance and policy to publish tha fact that the Government is importing coal.     The more secret the operations can be kept at first the better.If it is decided to import ooal, the duty should be laid upon tha Board of Trade, the Mines Department being responsible for the executive arrangemmts.The  Secretary for Mines would appoint a small departmental Committee to direct the work through selected commercial agents.     &amp;ubioct to the Committee^ instructions the agents would conduct the operations through their organisations.     The agents selected would be the four firms who did the work in 1921,Arrangements would have to be made for giving them advances of suras to cover their disbursements as these are made.The cargoes would be brought to the dischargingports offering most conveniences for discharge and forrailing away.     In the main these are also tha portsgiving access to the areas of largest population andgreatest need.     On arrival the cargoes would be handed/over
over to Government receivers (in many cases the buying agents will also be the receivers) for disposal to consumers whose needs are vital for the maintenance of the life of the community,  in accordance with the recommendations made to the Department by the existing emergency organisations (The Central Emergency Committee, the Metropolitan Emergency Committee, the Coal and Coal Shipment C ommi t tees),The receivers referred to have already been appointed in connection with the scheme of distribution of cargoes of British coal during a strike, and in tie case of the more important areas have definite experience  of this handling of Government cargoes.This, it is considered,should be encouraged although the coal mill not necessarily be for the maintenance of vital services,      The question is of importance if there are signs that port and railway labour regard private importations of coal as strike breaking.      Steps would be taken in the cases  of large consumers such as the Railways to obviate competition with Government buyers forcing up prices abroad,Mines Department. 19.5.26.
