rPIS T)0C11ENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MA majesty S GOVERNMENT) .Iecret. Copy Ro.i. P. 260 f 8.6]..CABINET.IMPERIAL CONFERENCE 1926  (DOCUMENTS)  COMMITTEE.COOPERATION IN financial ASSISTANCE TO IMPERIAL DEVELOPMENT.REPORT.1, At their Meeting on 9th June 1926 (Cabinet 37(26)Conclusion 7), the Cabinet,  after approving the CommitteeTs Report fCP.224( 6)) respecting the documents prepared for transmission to the Dominion and Indian Governments,  invited the Committee to reassemble to consider certain briefs prepared for the use of Ministers at the forthcoming Imperial Conference. Among these briefs is one prepared by the Inter-Departmental Committee on Economic Questions on the subject of Co-operati.on in Financial Assistance to Imperial Development.    A copy of this brief is appended to this Report (Paper No. E.(E.B) 5). It will be observed that the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs dissented from the views expressed in the brief.2. The question before the Committee was what attitudeshould be adopted by the British Representatives at the Imperial Conference towards the scheme for financial assistance in Imperial development which bw/as accepted by the Imperial Economic Conference in 1923 and subsequently embodied in Section 2 of the Trade Facilities Act 1924.3*        Under the scheme the British Government may contribute three-fourths of the interest payable for the first five years
on loans raised in the United Kingdom for publicutility purposes in the Dominions on certain conditionsof which the following are the more important -fa) that the expenditure is &quot;anticipated &quot;expend itur&amp;r&apos;(b) that the interest subvention is only payable in respect of the part of the loan expended in the United Kingdom..fc) that the expenditure will assist unemployment in the United Kingdom,(d) that applications and loans must be approved within 3 years ending 15th May 19B7 and that the amount payable by the Treasury should not exceed  1,000,000 in any year or  5,000,000 in all.4. The scheme has failed if judged by the use so farmade of it.    Up to 28th January 1926,  12 applications had been considered of which only 3 had been recommended for approval.      Those 3 schemes involved a total expenditure in the United Kingdom of  480,653 and a total liability on the Exchequer of  86,000 spread over 4 or 5 years.5, The Committee are informed that the AdvisoryCommittee, which administers the scheme, have reported that in their opinion its failure may be mainly attributable to the existence of those conditions which require theV loans to be raised in the United Kingdom and the expenditure to be &quot;anticipated&quot; expenditure, and that modification of these conditions might lead to its being more extensiyelv used.      while the Treasury have declined to entertain the Advisory Committee1^ recommendations, the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs has suggested that at the Conference the British Representatives should be authorised&quot;&apos; tomdiscuss the question on the basis of some relaxatibn of the restrictive conditions.      In support of this view
he has urged that the Government are pledged to the policy of assisting Imperial development by financial means, that Imperial development is the best method of increasing the export trade, that the scheme to some extent relieves unemployment at home and that the Government are morally bound to do all in their power to ensure the effective working of the scheme.6. On the other hand it has been pointed out thatthe Government decision to discontinue the St. David Ts Committee system of grants in aid of interest charges on municipal loans for unemployment relief, makes it extremely difficult to justify an entirely different policy in the case of oversea development works, that the Dominions already receive in the shape of Preferential Customs duties,  oversea settlement grants and trustee security privileges far more important and valuable financial assistance than they can ever obtain under the 1924 Act, and that the Dominions have in recent years raised loans exceeding  800 millions in London.    In the case of Australia there is, in the view of the Treasury, good ground for thinking that development based on borrowed money has proceeded too rapidly.      The Treasury consider the best method of assisting Imperial development lies in the reduction of standard money rates at home,  and that accordingly with a view to ensuring the success of the coming debt conversions financial commitments should be rigorously restricted and schemes such as that now in question operated within as narrow limits as practicable.
7,     Having regard to these, among other considerations, the Committee considered it desirable to examine the scheme with a view to seeing whether it could be made to operate success-fully within the present general limits of expenditure.     As a result of this examination (which was undertaken by a Sub-Committee authorised to report direct to the Cabinet) it would appear that variation of the scheme Is only possible in the following three directions -A. Abolition of the &quot;anticipation&quot; conditionThe 1923 arrangements were based on the  vork being&quot;anticipated&quot; work, and this has throughout been regardedas a fundamental feature of the scheme.      In the absenceof this condition there would be nothing to prevent claims for assistance In respect of all works undertaken out ofborrowed money.     The experience of the St, David&apos;sCommittee shows the absolute necessity for restrictingState aid to &quot;anticipated&quot; works and for rigidadministration of the approved arrangements if the s?rstem.is to be kept free from grave abuse and if the door isnot to be opened to works which, in the absence ofassistance would have in any case been undertaken in theordinary course and without any state aid.^* Abolition of the condition that, the loans must be raised in the United Kingdom.This in effect would mean that the British taxpayerwould be called upon to contribute towards the payment ofinterest on such part of a loan raised in the United states as may be expended in Great Britain or on internal loans raised bv the Government of India, thereby relieving thatGovernment of a burden which it would otherwise have tobear.      Proposals of this kind are not likely to findmuch favour in the Ho\ise of Commons or in the country.
Incidentally the adoption of the proposal would tend toincrease British exchange difficulties.G - 1 mprovemgnt of the terms.....of assistance.The present terms  (three-fourths of the interest for the first five years of the loan period) areexceptionally generous and the Committee see no possiblejustification for offering more favourable arrangements.As a result of their examination of the scheme theCommittee have reached the conclusion that the only possible variations which might make it more attractive tothe Dominions are all open to the gravest objections andare not such as they can recommend the Cabinet to entertain.In these circumstances they have agreed that any continuanceof the scheme must be conditional on the maintenance of thepresent conditions,, particularly those to which special reference is made in the preceding paragraph.The Committee recommend to the Cabinet -(l) That the British Representatives at the Imperial Conference should not them-selves initiate anv discussion on the scheme of co-operation in financial assistance to Imperial development.(2) That if any  question as to the scheme is raised by the Representatives of the Dominions, the British Representatives should intimate that, if the Dominions so desire, the British Government will be prepared to continue the scheme for a further period of say 3 years on the present terms and subject to the existing conditions and restrictions.Signed on behalf of the Committee.)

SECRET.E (E.B.) 5.28CABINET.Imperial Conference, 1926.P.C. Br. 8B.CO-OPERATION IN FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO IMPERIALDEVELOPMENT,Draft Brief submitted by the Inter-Departmental Committee onEconomic Questions.IT is not proposed that the Imperial Government should raise any question under this head. The following notes are merely explanatory of the position, in case the matter is raised by some other member of the Conference.2. The Committee on Co-operation in Financial Assistance set up by the Imperial Economic Conference, 1923, reported as follows : &quot; The Committee on Financial Co-operation recommends for adoption by the Conference the following scheme which was submitted to the Committee by the representatives of His Majesty&apos;s Government: -&quot; The suggestion which the Imperial Government make is that in order to facilitate the anticipation of work, which otherwise would not be taken in hand for some years, they should give a contribution towards the interest charges on loans raised for capital expenditure of this kind by public utility undertakings (viz., communications, power, lighting, water, drainage, irrigation, &amp;c). These undertakings might be under either public or private control or management.&quot; The assistance would be in respect of expenditure on orders placed in this country and would be applicable only to schemes approved by the Dominion or Central Government concerned and certified by it to be in anticipation of normal expenditure. Payment would be made to the Dominion or Central Government which would be responsible for payment to the ultimate recipient.&quot; It is suggested that the maximum grant should be three-quarters of the interest charges for a period of five years.&quot; In order to qualify for the Imperial contribution a scheme must be accepted by the Imperial Government within the next three years. The approval on behalf of the Imperial Government would be &apos; given after consultation with the Treasury, the Colonial or India Office and the Board of Trade.&quot; It would be understood that priority will be given to schemes involving the earliest placing of orders.&quot;3. Effect was given to this recommendation by Section 2 of the Trade Facilities Act, 1924, dated the 15th May, 1924 (copy appended). Under the terms of this Section, a contribution of three-fourths of the interest payable in tne firstnve years was contemplated : (L) In respect of loans raised in the United Kingdom either by the Govern-ment of any part of His Majesty&apos;s Dominions, or by a local authority,&apos; or by any body of persons constituted for the purpose of carrying out a public utility undertaking, provided,(2.) The expenditure involved in the scheme was in anticipation of expenditure which would normally have been incurred at a later date;(3.) That the contribution should only be payable in respect of such portion of the loan as was to be expended in the United Kingdom;(4.) The proceeds of the loan were to be applied in a manner calculated to promote employment in the United Kingdom. [14649]
The payment of part interest was restricted to the first five years of the currency of the loan, and it was further provided that no undertaking should be given by the Treasury after the expiration of three years from the 15th May, 1924, or in respect of a loan to be raised after that period, and that the amount payable by the Treasury should not exceed  1,000,000 in any year, or  5,000,000 in all.A Public Utility Undertaking was interpreted as an Undertaking for providing or improving communications, drainage, or irrigation, or for providing power, lighting or water, and His Majesty&apos;s Dominions were interpreted to include Protectorates (but not Mandated Territorites).4. By Treasury Minute of the 31st July, 1924, an Advisory Committee was set up consisting of Mr. W. K. Whigham, representing the Treasury, the Hon. Sidney Peel, nominated by the Board of Trade, and Mr. L. Couper, C.M.G., nominated by the Colonial Office (or Mr. C. H. Kisch, C.B., nominated by the India Office, when an undertaking in India was under consideration), to consider applica-tions and to make recommendations to the Treasury. Arrangements were made to secure proper liaison between this Committee and the main Trade Facilities Advisory Committee.5. Little use has been made of the scheme in practice; South Africa and the Irish Free State had no use for it; New Zealand, Australia and Southern Rhodesia put up a number of proposals which failed in some particular to satisfy the criteria laid down in the 1924 Act; and, on the 28th January, 1926, the Committee reported that they had considered twelve applications, of which three had been recommended involving a total expenditure in the United Kingdom of  480,653, and a total liability on the Imperial Exchequer of about  86,000 spread over 4 or 5 years. Of the remaining nine schemes, one did not involve the raising of a loan in the United Kingdom, two did not satisfy the conditions as to acceleration, and the remainder fell through.In the same letter, the Committee recommended certain modifications of the existing scheme which would have involved (a.) Payment, not of three-quarters of the interest on capital works defrayed by a loan raised in the United Kingdom, but of 3f per cent, for five years on capital works, whether paid for out of a loan or not, and if paid for out of a loan, without regard to where the loan was raised.(6.) The waiver of the present statutory condition that the Treasury are to be satisfied that the expenditure is in anticipation of expenditure which would normally have been incurred at a later date.6. The recommendations were not accepted. They go right outside the plan accepted by the Imperial Economic Conference of 1923, particularly in proposing to drop the important condition that the expenditure must be certified to be in anticipation of normal expenditure.Even if the recommendations had been otherwise acceptable, it would have been impossible for the Government to introduce legislation on these lines. The recommendations were received when the Trade Facilities Bill, 1926, was already under consideration, and during the passage of that Bill the Government spokesmen several times expressed the hope that the need for any Trade Facilities scheme would cease at no distant date. The decision of the Government to wind up the Trade Facilities Scheme was announced in the recent Budget Speech. In view of the urgent need for economy and of the improved conditions as regard employment, the Government have already curtailed in many directions expenditure in relief of unemployment. It would not be practicable to persuade Parliament to grant increased facilities in respect of public works in the Dominions at the very time when similar facilities in this country are being reduced or withdrawn.7. Finally, it should be borne in mind that very substantial assistance has been given under the main Trade Facilities Scheme to British firms in connection with capital works in the Dominions and Colonies. Guarantees of principal and interest have been given up to the 31st December last to a total amount of  8,250,000, ie,  5,690,000 in respect of seven Public Utility Undertakings and  2,560,000 in respect of three Industrial Undertakings.Note. The representatives of the Dominions Office and the Colonial Offe have intimated that the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs and the Colonies dissented from the views expressed in this draft Brief.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1, June 1926.
