[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty^ Government.] ,235Printed for the Cabinet,   June 1926.SECRET. CoPy No-   30CP. 255 (26).CABINET.W ALTH AM STOWS APPLICATION FOR A CHARTER OF INCORPORATION.Note by the Lord President of the Council.I SHOULD like to have the views of my colleagues in regard to a question which is raised by the unsatisfactory attitude of the Walthamstow Local Authorities during the General Strike.Some time ago the Urban District of Walthamstow applied for a Charter of Incorporation. The result of the usual enquiry and of the examination of the Draft Charter by the Government Departments concerned, was favourable to the application, which, in the normal course of events, I should have been disposed to agree to.During the General Strike, however, Major -Cope, the District Commissioner, forwarded to the Ministry of Health the following letter from the Chairman of the Volunteer Service Committee in regard to the attitude of the Walthamstow Urban District Council : &quot; Volunteer Service Committee,., Leyton Area,&quot; Major W. Cope, Council Offices,District Commissioners Office, Woodford Green.Ministry of Health. May 18, 1926.Dear Major Cope,Re Walthamstow Urban District Council.From my daily reports you are fully aware of the unpardonable and illegal action of the Walthamstow Council not only in cutting off the power from the manufacturers in their own area and causing a vast amount of local distress during the recent emergency, but in their further effort to make our task more difficult by ceasing to supply in bulk the Leyton Urban District Council without proper notice. It is unnecessary for me to point out to you how very serious the position might have become had Leyton been plunged into darkness, in all the circumstances then applying.The Urban Councils of Ilford, Leyton and Walthamstow have been engaged for some time in seeking Incorporation, and in ordinary circumstances would, I understand, have received their separate Charters in August. The very strongest feeling exists in the contiguous districts that Walthamstow has proved utterly unworthy of such Civil recognition. Such feeling is naturally particularly strong in Leyton. Surely a Council who, at a time of great national emergency, have done nothing to assist His Majesty&apos;s Government, but, in fact, everything to make their task more difficult, are not entitled to expect from the Privy Council at the present time any assistance in attaining the object of their ambition.It is typical of the mentality of some of the people concerned that I note, from the report in the &apos; Walthamstow Guardian,&apos; that a meeting of the Incorpora-tion Committee, of which Councillor McEntee is a member, was actually held on Friday last to deal with the question of the Arms of the proposed new Borough.

Should they be successful, it is more than likely that, after the Charter Mayor, the first member of their Council chosen for Civic Honours may well be one of the gentlemen responsible for the shameful action of the Council during the crisis.I felt it my duty to draw your attention to this matter.Believe me to be,Yours faithfully, (Signed) A. Jambs Hawkey, Chairman,Volunteer Service Committee, Leyton Area.&quot;In consequence of this letter the Ministry of Health wrote to the Privy Council Office on the 4th June, urging that action regarding the grant of&apos; a Charter of Incorporation to the Urban District of Walthamstow should proceed no further, pending further consideration by the Government of the general questions of the policy to be adopted in regard to Local Authorities who failed to perform their duties during the General Strike.I was disposed to agree in principle with the views of the Minister of Health, but before taking action I thought it would be wise to ascertain confidentially whether Major Cope had modified his views in the quieter times which followed the General Strike. This, however, is not the case, as is shown by the following confidential letter received from Major Cope : &quot;Lt.-Col. Sir Maurice Hankey, G.C.B., Privy Council Office,London, S.W. 1.Dear Sir Maurice Hankey, June 22, 1926.In reply to yours of the 21st June, No. 132224, with reference to the letter addressed to me when Civil Commissioner for London and the Home Counties during the Strike by the Chairman of the Volunteer Service Committee in the Leyton Area regarding the failure of the Walthamstow Urban District Council to perform its duties during the -Emergency Period.I feel that I can fully confirm the statement contained in that letter. On the 5th May it was reported to me : &apos; All the Local Authorities, with the exception of Walthamstow, are rendering every assistance.&apos; On the 7th May it was reported: &apos; The co-operation of the Local Authorities is quite satisfactory, with the exception of Walthamstow. They have cut off the electricity supply to the large consumers of power by removing the switches.&apos; On the 8th May it was reported: &apos; The position has become worse with regard to Walthamstow. Practically all the factories in the Walthamstow area are out of action as far as electricity is concerned.&apos; And later on that day : &apos; The Leyton Council to-day received notice of the intention of the Walthamstow Council, who supply in bulk to them from their Power Station, to cut off the electricity supply/ This was done, and the supply of electricity was continued by Naval Ratings and Volunteers being sent to re-open the old works of the Leyton Council from which electricity was supplied prior to the Leyton Council arranging to take it in bulk from Walthamstow.The action of the Walthamstow Council undoubtedly residted in many thousands of men, other than strikers, being thrown out of work, and caused considerable distress.It will be seen from the above extracts from the reports sent to me that Walthamstow throughout the whole of the emergency period proved to be a thorn in the flesh both of the Chairman of the District and of myself, as Civil Commissioner for the Division.The letter of the 18th May referred to from Sir James Hawkey was forwarded by Mr. Oxley, my Chief Assistant, to the Ministry of Health on the 19th May on my handing over my duties as Civil Commissioner to him in accordance with instructions received from the Chief Civil Commissioner.Yours very truly, (Signed) W. Cope.&quot;While I have no doubt that the course proposed by the Ministry of Health is the right one, I feel bound to warn the Cabinet that a certain amount of outcry is likely to be raised by a refusal to grant the Charter. I have been informed by Sir Hamar Greenwood, one of the Members for the Walthamstow Division, that very great
interest is taken locally in the Charter. All parties have combined in the effort to secure it; local public spirit has been stimulated ; great disappointment will be felt at the refusal. We shall be told that the innocent are being made to suffer for the guilty, and other objections will be raised.All this does not modify my own view that we ought not to advise the grant of the privilege of a Charter to a Local Authority which was guilty of gross dereliction of its duty in a time of national crisis. Although it is unusual in refusing a petition for a Charter of Incorporation to give any reason, I propose, if the Cabinet agrees, to make an exception in this case, and to inform the petitioners that the Committee of Council have decided to postpone any further action in the matter of the Walbhamstow petition for Incorporation on account of the deliberate neglect of the Local Authority to do its duty during the General Strike.A. J. B.June 25, 1926.
