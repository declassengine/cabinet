miS DOCUMENT 13 THE PROPERTY OF HIS  BRIT/^TXC H^3TY*3 GOVERNMENT.C A B I NET.  21--CP.No.216(26) .   - &quot;&quot;&quot;-ATTEMPTED ASSASSINATION OF SIGN OR MUSSOLINI.REPORT ON THE CASE OF MISS GIBSONMemorandum by the Minister of Health.It will be within the recollection of the Cabinet that it was decided on the 15th April last (Cabinet Conclusions 16(26)) that the case of Miss Gibson, who was accused of an attempt to assassinate Signer Mussolini, should be forwarded by me to the Board of Control for consideration.The report on the case obtained by the Home Secretary from the Board of Control, which was before the Cabinet at the time, showed that Miss Gibson had been admitted in October, 1923, as &apos;a private patient to the Holloway Sanatorium Mental Hospital at Virginia Water on the petition of her sister, as being Insane and apparently of very definite homicidal tendencies, - thus a certificate relating to the time of her entry into the Holloway Sanatorium speaks of her as &quot;sitting on the floor of the padded room oalling for people to kill.     She said she had already nearly killed one and must have some more&quot;.     She admitted having committed assaults with Intent to kill, and in the mental hospital assaulted/ attendants and other patients.     In the six months following October, 1923, however, Miss Gibson Improved /and on the 19th March, 1924, she was discharged to the carte of her sister.It Is apparent, how/ever, that the Improvement was not maintained,  as a year later, in March, 1925, the Board of Control ware approached orji behalf of Miss Gibson&apos;a motherfor advice as to the steps WHich could and should be taken for her protection on her arrival in England, after an
attempt to commit suicide in Rome .     An Interview was accorded at the Board of Control to the solicitors representing Miss Gibson^ mother and certain advice given, but eftor that no more was heard of the Cage.I have referred the case to the Board of Control as desired by the Cabinet and have received their report. This report points out thai, under the existing low, a private patient must be discharged if the person on whoea petition the reception order was made directs the discharge In writing, and that the Medical Officer of the Institution can only resist such a petition if he certifies in writing that the patient Is dangerous and unfit to be at large.     In Miss Gibs on&apos;s case the Medical Superintendent did hot consider the case as one iri which he could Certify that the patient was so dangerous and unfit.The limited power of the Medical Officer to resist a petition is clearly the weak point in the present position, and the Board of Control point out In their report that It is quite impossible in cases of insanity to decide whether dangerous tendencies formerly manifested will return or not and the Lunacy Act does not entitle    a Medical Officer to refuse to discharge a case merely because he may be doubtful as to the possible return of symptoms.     T understand that the Royal Commission on Lunacy and Mental Disorder are impressed with the weakness of the position and that they have it in mind to propose a tightening up of the procedure, whereby the Medical Officer will.have more powers of resisting a petition.     The Commission contemplates a proposal on the lines that the right of a petitioner to direct the discharge of a patient should be barred if the medical man certifies, not necessarily that the patient is dangerous or unfit to be at large, but thatmm    %     **
discharge to the petitioner would be contrary to the welfare of tho patient *Such a recommendation, if carried Into force, would, of course, ameliorate the situation but it still remains doubtful whether it would be of much effect in a case such as that of Miss? Gibson, where there may not be indications at the time of the petition that the condition of the patient Is such that the Medical Officer would be justified in resisting the petition.     I do not see, however, that anything more effective than this can be proponed.     Any such system as, e.g., one under which persons detained and released should be required to report themselves periodically for re-examination, would be difficult to administer and I do not think that such a requirement would be tolerated by public opinion.     I will, however, bear the case in mind when I come to consider the question of legislation to carry out the recommendations which may   be made by the Royal Commission.N..0 *31st May,  1926.
