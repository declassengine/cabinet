FOR RECORD.(tm&amp;MZZmmlL-lS^Jl^^&amp;m^y of His Britannio Ma. i esty&apos; s Goyernment..)ff F, 0 R g TOOPY No .(36) .GAB  I N E T.THEOPALDISPUTE,Draft Statement to &quot;be made by the Prime Minister when announcing the decision of the Government to legislate on Minors&apos; Honrs.I have received,    positive assurano es from the coal owners that, on the basis of an eight-hour day, there are certain districts, producing approximately 50 per cent, of the output of the country, in which the men will be offered a continuance of their existing wages for July, August and September.    Over more than half of the rest of the country the reduction asked, if one is asked at all, will be something materially less than the 10$ drop that the offer already made by the owners on the eight-hour basis contemplated as a maximum, and. the men will, during July, August and Septemberbe guaranteed that wage. During this period the Government will press on with their reorganisation legislation, and the owners,  for their part, will take all possible steps to make effective such of the proposals of the Commission as may be necessary to leave no ground for doubt that the men will get all that is due to there under the wages ascertainments.    After these three months&apos; the wages will be based on the ascertained proceeds of the industry in the ordinary way,  October being based on July and August, and it may reasonably be hoped that over a substantial portion of the industry the wages rates may still be maintained if no  actually increased.    In any case, under the proposal already made by the. owners, they could not in any district fall below the 19S1 minimum, which, the owners point out, having regard to thfchange in the cost of living, would now give a real wage       80% higher
