(Thi3 documei&amp;ife is the. prouerty^of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government^ E hMS?SECRET,.?. 236 (2f)Memorandum hy the Homo Secretary.There are two questions upon which I should like the views of the Cabinet in connection with Russian money.      They are quite distinct, the first being whether in consequence of the action of the Russian Government working through its Trading Company, Arcos, and other State Institutions in London during the recent General Strike it is desirable to expel such institu-tions and the Russian Embassy from the country.      The  second question is whether I should under the powers I possess endeavour to prevent .tho influx of foreign money, whether from Russia    or otherwise, to the strike fund or the wives and children fund of the miners during the coal stoppage.I think I may ask the Cabinet to accept tho position which tho Foreign Office has always held that the Soviet Government cannot escape responsibility for the actions of the Communist International of Moscow, generally known as the Third International.      In any case, if my colleagues desire the evidence which has satisfied the Foreign Secretary and myself to this effect, it can easily be furnished.I need not perhaps stress the fact that for two years past the object of the Third International, which is controlled largely by Zinovieff, has been to capture the British Trade Unions, by means of the Minority Movement and of course by the Communist Party, and undoubtedly Mr. Oook of the Miners&apos; Trade Union was directed to aot as the Moscow spearhead of the movement.On the 1st April,  1925, at a meeting of the Enlarged Executive of the Communist International at Moscow it was decided that steps should be taken to convert the British General Council of the Trade Union Congress into a directing organ of

The second question is whether I should under the powers I possess endeavour to prevent .tho influx of foreign money, whether from Russia   or otherwise, to the strike fund or the wives and children fund of the miners during tho coal stoppage.I think I may ask the Cabinet to accept the position which tho Foreign Office has always held that the Soviet Government cannot escape responsibility for the actions of the Communist International of Moscow, generally known as the Third International.      In any case, if my colleagues desire the evidence which has satisfied the Foreign Secretary and myself to this effect, it can easily be furnished.I need not perhaps stress the fact that for two years , past the object of the Third International, which is controlled largely&apos;by Zinovieff, has been to capture the British Trade Unions,by means of the Minority Movement and of course by the Communist Party, and undoubtedly Mr. Cook of the Miners&apos; Trade Union was directed to act as the Moscow spearhead of the movement.On the 1st April,  1925, at a meeting of the Enlarged Executive of the Communist International at Moscow it was decided that steps should be taken to convert the British General Council of the Trade Union Congress into a directing organ of
all the Trade Unions.      During the same month tho Anglo-Russian Trade Union Conference was held in London.      Tomski. by my permission, camo over and the British representatives included Swales, Tillett, Purcell, Poulton and Bramley.An Anglo-Russian Advisory Committee was established for maintaining permanent .and close oontaot between the extremists of the two countries.At the end of August,  1925, Losovski, general Secretary of the Red International of Labour Unions attendedOffa meeting in Berlin, at which he explained the programme for bringing about an upheaval in England.     He said that early in 1926 it was Intended to bring about a simultaneous strike in England and on the Continent, which would affect the miners, metal workers, transport and other workers. It was anticipated, he said, that the  strike would be of several months&apos; duration and would be primarily of ah economic nature..    As it progressed, however, political demands would be advanced.Mr. Cook was present at this Berlin meeting and expressed considerable fear lest anything should be done to provoke repressive measures by His Majesty&apos;s Government.In September, 1925, at tho Scarborough Conference, the General Council of the Trade Union Congress were accorded the despotic powers which Moscow intended that they should have.Since that time, September 1925, the connection between Moscow and the British Trade Unions, maintained through the Anglo-Russian Trade Union Unity Committee, has been intimate and uninterrupted.      There have been repeated comings and goings;    various joint meetings have been held;    and the Soviet Embassy in London has even acted as a channel for the transmission of messages.On the 14th january^, 1926, the Executive Bureau of the Red International of labour Unions (which is actually an
Agency of the Communist International and of the Soviet 16.1Government&quot;)  considered a letter from Mr. Citrine and decided to ensure the effectiveness of the Strike Fund inEngland by transferring monejr to the Strike Committee ofthe General Council.      On the 3rd February, the CommunistInternational instructed the British Communists tocomplete their organisation among the unemployed by the1st March.      These instructions stated that &quot;upon thesuccess of the revolutionary movement in England nowdepends the whole course of the international socialrevolution.      Only a well organised mass strike movementcan prepare the way for active revolutionary struggle.&quot;On the 21st February, a Special Commission of the CommunistInternational held a meeting at which decisions were passed.regarding the organisation of strike committees, fightinggroups and so on, for the purpose of revolutionising theBritish Trade Union movement;    regarding the organisationof the unemployed on a Communist basis;    and regardingrevolutionary activities among Government employees, theArmy and the Navy.      On the 26th February,  the CommunistInternational sent instructions to the. British CommunistParty regarding the organisation of women for strikepurposes.      On the 8th March, the Executive Bureau of the  ReInternational of Labour Unions decided to set up a special commission for dealing with the British strike situation,to include Allison, the.British Communist.      At the samemeeting it was decided that special use should be made ofthe influence of Mr.  Swales.      On the  12th March, the Red   , -of LabourInternational^Unions decided to send a sum of  25,000 for the support of the British National Minority Movement, which money was to be paid out through Messrs. Saklatvala and Mann.      On the 29th March, the Executive Bureau decided&quot;&quot;&quot;The Red International of Labour Unions was established in 1921 under the auspices of the Communist International for the    purpose of directing the activities of Trades Unions throughout the world into revolutionary channels.    The  ^   ^   . Russian Trade Unions are affiliated to and. with the addition of a few minority movements in other countries, constitute the Red International of Labour Unions.
&quot;to adopt all measures to render more acute the relations between labour in the mining industry and the employers on purely individual grounds&quot;, in order to prevent an agreement.- The facts in this memorandum so far are based on the most secret information in the possession of the Foreign Office and I beg my colleagues not to make any of it public in any way without communicating with myself.I need not refer to the Communist trial and to the documents then discovered, but many of them sufficiently prove the close connection between the Communist Party, the National Minority Movement which may be regarded as the extreme left-wing of the Trade Union movement in this country, and Moscow.      Since the trial matters have not stood stilly      1 should like to call the attention of the Cabinet to one or two extracts from statements in Russia which show tho continuance of this close connection.In his concluding speech at the Sixteenth Session of the Enlarged Executive Committee of the Communist Interna-tional on the 8th March, Zinovieff dealt with the &quot;Immediate Problems of the International Communist Movement&quot; and in referring to the Goal Crisis is reported to have said:-. &quot;We must realise that the forthcoming conflict in Great Britain, if it does break out will not be an ordinary strike, but will be the beginning of a new phase in the British labour movement.      This conflict, if it does break will have in it the embryo of coming big social struggles which are inevitable in Great Britain.&quot; \In Zinovieff&apos;s concluding speech at the TwentiethSession of that body on the 15th March he said:-&quot;What is the position in the most important countries of Europe, from the standpoint of the prospects of revolutionary development in the futuret We must all realise,  comrades, that England is on the eve of a mighty struggle, and this struggle will take the form almost of a social catastrophe.      (This does not mean, of course,  that it is a matter of days or weeks).      I must once mere return to the question of the coming struggle in the ocal mining industry. When this strike breaks out, then the first, the main task of the Comintern will be the organisation of international support for this strike on every section of the European and world front.&quot;
-5-163&quot;We must all follow the English events with the most oareful attention, and as soon as the strike breaks out we must display an energetic initiative on an international scale.&quot;In order that nothing might be left undone to ensurethe success of the miners strike, the Red Internationalwere prepared, in the event of a stoppage occurring, toco-operate with the International Federation of TradeUnions and in Prayda of April 18th there was published aletter]of which the following are extracts:-&quot;The impending conflict in the English mining industry-possesses a olearly expressed international character and demands a oareful and serious attitude on the part of the workers of all countries and all international ---organisations-^ *&quot;Accordingly, the Executive Bureau of .&quot;Profintern&quot; proposes to organise simultaneously help and support to the British miners in their just fight against the advance of united and well-organised capital&quot;.In the Manifesto of April 25th issued by theExecutive Committee Communist International appears thefoilowing:-&quot;The Communist International calls the wcrkers to international solidarity action.      The wcrkers of Germany, France, Belgium and of Czechoslovakia must prevent with united forces any strike-breaking coal being sent to England, must prevent by watchful control the supplying of the English market.      The transport workers, railway workers, dock workers and seamen must prevent the trans-port of strike-breaking coal..     If the struggle comes, there must everywhere be organised wide-scaled action and support;    collections of money must be arranged, measure adopted for caring for the children of the fighting miners, the co-operatives must help in supplying provisions -for the British miners and their families.&quot;On May 5th the Executive Committee Comunist Interna-tional issued a Manifesto, containing the following:-&quot;The great contests between Capital and Labour in Great Britain began as an economic struggle, but is developing into a political one7&apos;&quot;.On May 11th an unsigned Article headed &quot;The BritishStrike  - Its Strong and Weak Sides&quot; appeared in &quot;Pravda&quot;The Red International of Labour Unions. \
-e-and contained the following:-&quot;The weak points in the struggle are the following:-(l) Insufficient clearness of aim, and lack of understanding  (in seme cases wilful), on the part of many leaders of the strike.      They will not see the political nature of the struggle, which existed from the very first moment, ncr do they understand that they can only win if they definitely and admittedly make the issue a political one........While the gigantic mistake again was made by the T.U. leaders when they declared with a persistence worthy of a better cause, that the strike was in no ways a political one.      This last mistake may well prove tc be a fatal one&quot;.It will be seen that in the Manifesto of April 25th occurs the distinct intimation of provision for the British miners and their families.On the 24th May Lozovsky sent a telegram to Gookgiving the text of an appeal he had issued, as follows:-&quot;Red International of Labour Unions and all its affiliated bodies will continue work of extending aid to British miners stopping at nothing.      The miners&apos; fight is our fight.     Men and women workers all to leave British miners now to mercies of bourgeoiisie would be ^criminal act.      To let coal and other fuel into Britain would now be blacklegging.      To stop collecting funds now when a million miners are in thick of fight would be monstrous violation of class solidarity.&quot;\\
So far we see their close connection with and close -desire to help the British Trade Unionists in their fight  , against the Capitalists.    How then was that carried out? First with regard to the General Strike.In the early days of May it appeared from the press thatsome  26,000 had been sent by Lloyd&apos;s    Bank to the Trade&apos; UnionCongress,  being money obtained from Russian sources, and,  as my colleagues know, the Congress made a great gesture and returned the money.    I have ascertained that  25,000 of the credit at Lloyds was furnished by a transfer of that sum fromArcos.    This is shown by the following telegram on the 6th may from the Industrial and Commercial Bank at Moscow, acting forthe All Russian Central Council of Trade Unions, to Lloyds:-&quot;We have ordered by cable today Arcos Bank pay you  25,000&quot; .This is presumably the sum of 250,000 roubles referred to in a long telegram of May 5th from Dogadov,  Secretary of the All Russian Central Council of Trade Unions at Moscow, to Citrine,  Secretary of the T.U.C..   This telegram states that having heard a report on the strike in England and an appeal by the Red International of Labour Unions and the International Workers&apos; Aid Society for the support of the strikers, the Presidium of the All Russian Central Council of Trade Unions resolved to call upon all members of Soviet Trade Unions to contribute a fourth of their daily wage and to remit immediately to the General Council, T.U.C. 250,000 roubles (i.e.  25,000)  as a first instalment.    A Committee was appointed consisting of Dogadov, Lozovsky, Gorbachev and others to organise collections and work out measures for supporting the English strikers.A few days later telegrams came into my possession showing that on May 7th the All Russian Central Council of Trade Unions had ordered the transfer of a second instalment of 2 million roubles to the T.U.C:    that on May 8th the Industrial and Commercial Bank paid  200,000 to Lloyds
-s- 166collected,  as to  175,000 from the Deutsche Bank of Berlin, and as to  25,000 from the Chase Bank of New York, both banks having credits in this country;    that on the day after  100,000 was ordered to be paid by Lloyds Bank on account of the All Russian Central Council of Trade Unions, to the T.U.C.J    I thereupon took action under the Emergency Powers Act and forbade the transfer of that money to the T.U.C.J    subsequently Lloyds Bank wero requested to return it to Germany and I assentod to that course.So far for what was known during the Strike.    We have sinoo found out something much more important.    It appears that on the 4th May throe cheques of  100,000 each drawn by the Bank-for Russian Trade Ltd.   (the successor of the former Arcos Banking Corporation) on Lloyd&apos;s, the Midland, and the National Provincial Banks, were paid into the Westminster Bank to the credit of the Wholesale Cooperative Society.Lloyd&apos;s informed me of their share in this transactionbut stated, I believe perfectly sincerely,  that they thoughtit was an ordinary business transaction, and indeed theNational Provincial seem to have had no evidence that theirtransaction was of any suspicious character.    We now, however,find that the  300,000 at the Westminster Bank was drawn out bythe Wholesale Cooperative Society by cheques paid over the counter as follows:-On the 4th May  98,000 in Treasury notes and  2,000 in silver.On the 5th May  190,000 in Treasury notes and no less than  12,000 in silver.This money was taken away in motor cars and the Cooperativerepresentatives quite openly alluded to it as strike pay.Curiously,  on the Rth May 100,000 new unopened Treasury not.es were paid back to the Westminster Bank with the intimation that the Unions had over-estimated their requirements to this extent.This evidence seems to me quite conclusive that the Bank for Russian Trade Ltd. ownod and.controlled by the Soviet
Government, was without doubt providing money on the first day of the General Strike for the financing of the strike,  and it is a matter for the consideration of the Cabinet how far this fits in with what I have already mentioned as to the determination of the leading members of the Russian Government to take part in our troubles here and to take part in them in a manner contrary to the best interests of our countryj    and if so whether we should any longer permit the continued presence in our midst of what events have shown and are showing to be a source of serious danger.The second question relates to the financial assistance accorded to the miners from abroad.After the refusal of the T.U.G. to accept money fromRussia there-was an article in the  &quot;Pravda&apos;  of the 11th Maysigned by Dogadov in which he said:-&quot;The Central Council of Trades Unions of the U.S.S.R. had resolved, first to return to the Central Council the sums remitted to the General Council of Trades Unions, secondly, to continue the collections for the British Coal Miners, thirdly,  to deposit all sums collected as a special relief fund for the British coal miners with the provision that the entire fund shall be placed at the disposal of the General Council or the British Miners&apos; Federation at their request&quot;.On the 15th May the following telegram was sent by the Fifth Miners&apos;  Congress of Russia to the Miners&apos; Federation:-&quot;The Central Committee of Miners&apos; Unions of U.S.S.R, has received today from Central Council of Trades Unions of U.S.S.R. 2,600,000 roubles,  collected by workers of Soviet Union in order to help English workers.    The Miners&apos; Congress of Soviet Union which is now taking place in Moscow,  decided to place this sum at disposal of Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain.    Waiting for your advice. Yours fraternally.    By order of Fifth Miners&apos; Congress U.S.S.R,&quot;,and Mr. Cook lost no time in wiring back on the 17th May giving his deepest thanks for the splendid practical example of international solidarity and requesting that the money should be sent to his name at the Cooperative Wholesale Society (Bankers) Ltd.    On the 18th May the Soviet Miners&apos; Union telegraphed to Cook that the money had been transferred.    On the 20th they wired that it was on its way.
-10- 168The International Red Aid also contributed  25,000 and itis probably to the distribution of this sum that the following telegram signed by Bailey and sent to the Workers&apos;  InternationalRelief at Berlin, refers&quot;Money given to Federation.    Arrangements for first distribution by Bailey and Lansbury on Sunday in Kent Coalfields.    Other questions in process of decision. Letter sent to Paris.    Bailey&quot;.Mr. Cook in the public press of May 24th appears to haveadmitted having received as the first contribution from Russia 274,000,  and that is confirmed by the Cooperative wholesale society (Bankers) Ltd.  stating that they had received on the22nd May through Barclay&apos;s Bank the sum of  274,541-4-3 for theMiners&apos; Federation.    From the evidence of Dogadov&apos;s article ofthe 11th May it is I think fair to assume that the bulk of thiswas made up by the  200,000 which was the subject of my order under the Emergency Regulations and the  25,000 which the T.U.C.refused to receive, the whole of it being money which had nothing to do with miners and which came direct from the russian trade Unions.It will be noted that the T.U.0. refused to accept this money on the ground that they were not pursuing any revoluntionary aims.    Mr. Cook is not nearly so particular.On the 28th May after Cook&apos;s statement on the 24th Dogadov wired that he was remitting 400,000 roubles for British miners and hoped within a week to make it up to  100,000.    On June 3rd he wired &quot;Remitted 300,000 roubles on June 1st&quot;.The Cooperative Wholesale Society  (Bankers) Ltd. state that on June 1st they received  42,238-12-11 and on June 2nd  34,511-19-6 through Barclay&apos;s Bank for the Miners&apos; Federation. These sums are probably the monies mentioned by Dogadov and were quite possibly collections made from various sources in Russia.While this money was being transmitted,  Cook telegraphed to Moscow:-&quot;Miners&apos;  Federation of Great Britain request following message handed Soviet Miners - &apos;Telegram received.    Will be glad have money as promised.    Congratulations to Soviet Workers for their splendid solidarity behalf British Miners. Cook Secretary&quot;.
Apparently on May 31st,  2,700 was sent to Cook by Cooperative Societies in Russia,  as a &quot;first instalment&quot;  and on June 2nd a small sum of just over  1,000 was sent from the Ukraine making a total received from Russia,  as far-as I can gather,  of  380,070.To leave Russia and go to other countries - apparently Cooktelegraphed on the 19th May to Amsterdam:-&quot;All help welcome:    monies to be sent to Miners&apos; Federation Headquarters&quot;.On June 4th Mr. Penman telegraphed to Hodges intimating thatKennedy was cabling 50,000 dollars for the British miners,  and onthe same day at a meeting of the Bureau of the InternationalMiners&apos;  Federation at Brussels, the Belgian,  French,  German and dutch representatives all promised continued financial support.In the &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot;  of the 7th June Cook is reported tohave said that they had already received  5,000 from Germany.It is,  I think,  quite clear that every effort is being madeby the Miners&apos;  Federation to get money from abroad.    I am not sure that I am prepared to say that they are acting wrongly in so doing,  but I think it is quite arguable,  if one is prepared tofollow out the full train of thought in this memorandum,  to saythat it is not a bona fide charity on the part of Russia andother countries,  but that it is a definitely left-wing movementin order to paralyse British trade and subsequently to destroy the economic position of this country.I have endeavoured as concisely as possible to put beforemy colleagues a conspectus of a vast number of documents which have passed through my hands in the past few weeks but I hope I havegiven enough to make the financial story clear.I would call special attention to the confidential reportfrom Sir R. Hodgson to the Foreign Secretary dated the 8th April,and especially to the extracts from Zinovlefx&quot;-s speeches on page 2,particularly the 3rd,  4th,  5th, 6th and 9th paragraphs.    Also toMr. Hodgson&apos;s memorandum of the 19th April which shows the close connection existing between the Soviet Government,  the- Russian
11th June,  1926.Communist Party and the Communist International.    1 understand that the Soviet Government is at present represented on the Executive of the  Comintern   by Rykoff,  Stalin and Kamenev.W.J.E.
