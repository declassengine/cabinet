^t^jdqotmemt IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY13 GOVERNMENT.hCABINET,SECRET.(26 ) Memorandum by the Minister of Labour.R railway     VOL U N T E B R S.1.     In accordance with the request of the Cabinet (Cabinet Conclusions 37(26) 6),I have been in communication with the Railway Companies, in order to ascertain the position with regard to volunteers.2.     The pledgee given by the Government were as follows&quot;Every man who has done his duty by the country and has remained at work or has returned to work during the present crisis will be protected by the State from loss of Trade Union benefits, superannuation allowances or pension&quot;.The Prime Minister, speaking in tha House on May 13th,after explaining that the Government were under no obligationwith regard to the reinstatement of men on strike, went on to say:-&quot;I have given no pledges at all, save one, and that Is that those who helped the Government should not suffer for having done so.  ....  ,     There is a real difficulty in reconciling a pledge of that kind with getting back all the men to work.   That must be threshed out between the trade unions and the employers1 associations.     It calls for real statesmanship&quot;.3.     Tho London Electric Railways and the Undergroundexplained to all volunteers whom they took on that theirengagement was for the period of the 6trike only, and theyretained none.4.     The other Railways did not make any such proviso In engaging volunteers, and they made arrangements for these who wished to do so to put down their names for permanent employment. If it were available.
5.     After the general strike was called off, the Companies met the Unions at once, in accordance with the Prime Minister1 a suggestion, to discuss the resumption of work.     The terms of settlement agreed on 14th May provided that railwaymen 1*10 went on strike, with the exception of those guilty of violence or intimidation, should he taken back to work was soon as traffic offers and work can be found for theirf&quot;,     In a supplementary settlement, it was agreed that the guaranteed week should be suspended for men in the conciliation grades who went on strike, and that short time should operate for men in the salaried grades who went on strike.6,     The Railway Companies point out that at present there Is insufficient work available for the railwaymen who struck, and that they made no promise of permanent employ-ment to volunteers.     So far as can be ascertained, they have not in fact retained any volunteers.     They state that they gave a gratuity, generally of two days&apos; pay, to volunteers who served during the strike, in accordance with the suggestion put forward officially by the Home Secretary on May 13th on behalf of the Government.     They point out that &quot;there is nothing In the pledge given by the Prime Minister which can be construed as indicating that volunteers who performed work on the railways during the Strike were to be permanently employed;     on the contrary, the Prime Minister&apos;s pledge relates only to employees of the Companies who remained at work or returned to work&quot;. 7.     The precise intention of the Government pledge was not clear as regards volunteers.     i have generally construed it as meaning that where a volunteer was induceda.
to take work by a promise of future employment, the employer should be encouraged to fulfil that promise if possiblej   where no such premise was given, no obligation existed to keep on a volunteer, especially if it stood in the way of a speedy settlement.     Clearly the Government could never promise permanent employment to volunteers.     Nor were they in a position to give any such promise on behalf of other employers.     The Companies on their oun account did not officially make or authorise any such promise.     Some of their local representatives may, of course, have given assurances to Individuals;   each of such cases can, and no doubt will, receive special consideration from the Company.     But it would obviously be inconsistent with the settlements reached with the Unions, for preference to be given to volunteers, especially when work Is scarce and there is systematic and widespread short time.    The Companies have kept lists of the volunteers who applied for permanent employment,(Intd) . A. S-M.Ministry of Labour. July 15th, 1926.
