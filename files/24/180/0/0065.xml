(THIS DQCjMT IS THE PROPERTY 0? HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.)bp. 264   (26).CABINET1Poor Relief to Dependants of Strikers in Scotland.Memorandum by the Secretary for Scotland.I think it right to acquaint my colleagues that a serious situation may., arise im; the,, very near future in connection with the relief of the dependants of miners in Scotland under the Poor Law.Concurrently with the issue of the Ministry of Health Circular at the commencement of the General Strike, the Scottish Board of Health issued a corresponding circular to Parish Councils pointing out that it was illegal to give relief to strikers but suggesting that relief might be given to the dependants of strikers.   Having regard to the difference in the Poor Laws of the two countries.there has always been some doubt as to the legality of relieving such dependants, and dissatisfied ratepayers have from time to time threatened to test its legality in the Law Courts.    The matter is now being brought to a head by an action of interdict which has been raised against a Lanarkshire Parish Council,   In the event of this action proving successful the result would be that none of the Parish Councils of Scotland would be able to continue giving relief to the dependants of strikers.      It is clear that an impossible situation would arise if these dependants were relieved in England and not in Scotland and it might be necessary to pass immediate legislation to assimilate the position in the two countries.The /
