DiPrevious Paper CP. 246 (26).CIRCULATED BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA.   \-AFGHANISTAN.I circulate for the information of my colleagues ;(a) A copy of a letter from the Government of India, No. 33 F., dated the10th June, commenting upon the Despatch from His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Kabul, No. 35, of the 7th May* which has already been circulated (CP. 234 (26));(b) a copy of a telegram, No. 85, from His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Kabul, dated2nd July, and(c) a copy of a telegram from the Government of India, No, 1181 S., commentingupon (b).The opinion expressed by the Government of India towards the end of their letter (a) that there is little immediate danger of a recurrence of&apos; a crisis between the Soviet and Afghan Governments over the question of the possession of the island in the Oxus, is supported by the first paragraph of Sir F. Humphrys.&apos; much later telegram (b).B1R KEN HEAD.12th July 1920.From the Foreign Secretarylo the Government of India, to the Under Secretary &apos; of Stale, for India, No. 33 F., 10th June 1026.1 am directed to refer to Despatch No. 35, dated the 7th May 1926, from His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Kabul on the Russor Afghan dispute over the island of Urtatagai.2. The Government of India have studied it with great interest. j Here and there, their own reading of events is a lit vie different from that of the Minister. They are inclined, for instance, to think that in the slightness of Urtatagai&apos;s intrinsic and strategic importance lies the explanation why the Russians were previously indifferent whether it remained their property or no ; and that their seizure of it last December was not part, of any political movement, but arose rather, as the Minister suggests, from irritation with the Afghans for allowing recalcitrant Tajiks to use it as a raiding base and for stopping Tajik emigres from crossing it on their way back to Russia. And evidence from other sources points clearly to the conclusion that the Russian Minister at Kabul would not have recommended the seizure but for the false assumption that Urtatagai was clear of Afghan troops and could therefore be occupied without clanger of serious trouble with Afghanistan, whose objections could be countered by an appeal to the old boundary treaties under which it was included in Russian territory.3. But differences in the interpretation of certain points of detail that must necessarily remain conjectural, do not impair the Government of India&apos;s agreement with the Ministers recommendation that in the event of a crisis over Urtatagai recurring and of Amir applying to him for assistance, he should be placed in a position to assure the Amir &quot;of His Majesty&apos;s Governments diplomatic support m promoting the peaceful solution of the dispute. If they have any hesitation on this score, it lies only in a doubt whether the support which the existing state of our relations with Russia might, enable us to give would be sufficient to justify the formal acceptance of the Amir&apos;s request for it, but of this they are not in a position to judge, the probabilities, however, seem to be that if Russia ever had any intention of 1303     100   7.26
proceeding to extremes over the island, she abandoned it once she agreed to its inoccupation by Afghan troops ; and that the difficulties to ourselves in this business will lie rather in the concessions she may wring out of the Afghan Government in return for the final relinquishmcnt of her claim. &quot;   ,I have, &amp;c.,JDenys Bray.Telegram from H.M. Minister at Kabul to Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsIndia Office, 2nd July 1926.85. 1st July. I saw Tarzi yesterday at Foreign Office. He seemed confident that Oxus incident would be settled in favour of Afghanistan, but expressed concern at vulnerability of Northern Frontier to Russian attack.He hinted that Afghan Government was contemplating negotiation of security pact with Soviet to tide over this menace, and asked my opinion of Russian treaties recently concluded with Germany and Turkey. I replied that treaties seemed partly in nature of advertisement and partly as answer to Locarno Pact. They contained amiable expressions of goodwill but little else. Tarzi remarked that all treaties were liable to be broken when put to the test.I gained the impression that Tarzi was trying to induce me to show my hand, and that Afghan Government is seriously considering pact with Soviet as part of their traditional policy of playing off Russia and Great Britain against each other.From local standpoint, I apprehend no clanger to British interests from conclusion of colourless itreaty on Turkish model between Russia and Afghanistan and, always provided that the terms are intrinsically unimportant, I should prefer to maintain attitude of indifference. Bat, if His Majesty&apos;s Government regard such a pact with disfavour, it is possible that I might be able to iafluence Afghan Government towards postponing if not altogether abandoning proposal. In that event my tactics would, of course, avoid committing His Majesty&apos;s Government in any way. I recpiest early instructions.Telegram from Viceroy to Secretary of State for India, 5ili July 1926.(Repeated to Kabul.)1181 S. Katodon 85. According to our intelligence all Russia, who started the treaty overtures, contemplates is innocuous neutrality pact, presumably as part of her Eastern wdndow-dressing. On the other hand, Afghan Government at once opened their mouth for something wider than existing treaty, including d ef en si \ e alliance against us. On Russians demurring to defensive alliance, Afghan Government appear to be concentrating on effort to secure material gifts. Unless we see negotiations taking different line, any depaiture from Ministers attitude of indifference would, in our opinion, be very impolitic.
