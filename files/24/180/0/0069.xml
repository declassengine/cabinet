13th July,  1926.(This Document is the property of His Britannio Majesty&apos;s Government).SECRET.CP. 268(26).CABINET. ARMISTICE DAY. Memorandum by the Home Secretary.It will shortly be necessary to consider preliminary arrangements for the celebration of Armistice Day which falls this year on a Thursday, and I shall be glad if my Colleagues will come to a decision as to the general lines on which they would recommend its observance.The Home Office, both from its location facing the Cenotaph and from its special functions seems to be better situated than any other Department of State to undertake the arrangements, and ever since the Unveiling Ceremony in 1920 a large.proportion of the work involved has always fallen on the Home Secretary, while since the death of Lord Curzon it has been the practice to make him solely responsible to the Cabinet and to The King.Do my Colleagues wish me again to undertake this duty? I presume they will desire that the celebration should be on similar lines to that of last year. His Majesty1s Pleasure will, of course, have to be ascertained before the detail of the programme is settled.W.J.H.
