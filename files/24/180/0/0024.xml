The Treasury attached great&apos; importance to this question on which they were directly opposed to the view held by the Dominions Office.      provided, however,  that there was no question of these papers being sent to the Dominion Governments, he had no objection at this stage to offer.    It would be necessary for the Cabinet to decide the future extent of co-operation in financial assistance and in the meanwhile if the question was  to be left in abeyance it was essential that there should be no marshalling of pressure from the Dominions in favour of the grant of further apsistance by His Majesty1s Government.SIR P.  CUNEIFEE-LISTER said that with the exception of the papers dealing- with the future of the Imperial Economic Committee and the Memorandum just referred to by the chancellor c the Exchequer,  he believed that no points of controversy arose in the other briefs prepared by the Sub-Committee.THE CHAIRMAN said that in view of the terms of reference of the Committee it would not be in order for them to proceed to a detailed  examination of the briefs prepared by the Sub-0 ommi ttee.

(b)   the future of the Imperial Economic Committewould require to be decided by the Cabinet before the Imperial Conference.(E)  That as regards the other briefs prepared by the Sub-Committee it should be left to the Ministers immediately concerned to arrange with the Secretary of the cabinet    if the y considered that a Cabinet decision was necessary.2 Whitehall Q gardens, 1st  June 19 26.
