in&quot; THIS DOCUMENT IS  THE PROFSRTY Off HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ (ftVEKNMBNT.SECRETL CABINET. ^ ^CP. 275 (26)TRADE   OUTLOOK. Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.I circulate the last monthly review of trade prospects which I have received from my Advisory Council.The remarkable feature, as I have already stated to the Cabinet, is the way in which industry, apart from the heavy coal users, is maintaining its output.    The report given by the different trades is borne out by the unemployment returns. In the ninth week of &quot;the strike of 1921 2,580,000 people, apart from coal miners, were reported as unemployed.    In the corresponding week of the present strike the number was 1,645,000*Although industries are making every effort to maintain their output, increased cost of fuel and reduced production must result In heavy losses.    The industries would, I think, be un-willing to risk these losses unless they felt satisfied that, once the coal strike is settled, an improvement In trade will take place.    This is the mos t hopeful feature.    In 1921 manufacturers felt that they were in for a slump.    They were, therefore, inclined to throw In their hands.    To-day,  they,   are showing a determination to keep their works going and fulfil contracts.    This Indicates more than a hope for better times.The Importation of coal is proceeding satisfactorily, In the week ending 10th July 492,000 tons were imported; and for the week ending 17th July the Importation amounts to upwards of 60C,000 tons .(INTLD.)

lieSTEEL (Contd.)&quot;Export orders have come in pretty steadily during thw whole of the strike period.     Recently home orders have fallen off considerably.&quot;I am quite sure that when the strike is settled, we shall do a better class of business than we have been doing for some years.&quot;The Japanese business is improving.    The Chinese Is wonderfully good considering the conditions there. In regard to Russia,  they are pressing very hard and sending special missions round the country to obtain long terms of credit from two to five years, paying 8% interest and some people are giv?.ng way to this pressure. The French business is entirely stopped by the Exchange, and the Belgian business is fast going the same way. Canada, Australia and New Zealand,  South Africa and india all continue to take a good deal of Sheffield Steel and Too Is.&quot;The serious feature of the situation is that Siemens Martin and Bessemer Steel billets are running short and handicapping the mills and forges, which would otherwise be in a position to run so far as fuel is concerned.&quot;Large quantities of &quot;.7estphalian Coal have come into the district.    While some of the coal has been unsatis-factory, the bulk of the supply has been reasonably good; price has been somewhere around 55/- per ton&quot;.NON-FERROUS METALS.SIR CECIL BUDD wrote&quot;At the last meeting,  I reported my expectation that the Metal Industries could carry on for about a month at their then scale of operations, despite the restrictions imposed on them by the coal strike.    This expectation has been fulfilled, but the difficulties have been increasing;    activities in many directions are consequently being reduced, and this movement will continue. Foreign coal is, of course, being used, but delivery is generally uncertain,  the quality mostly inferior to British, and the price materially higher.&quot;Continental manufacturers are reaping our harvest, and I fear we may have a long haul to regain our loss after the mines have re-started.      The longer the strike lasts, the more permanent will be the damage inflicted on the metal trades, which have to compete with finely equipped Continental Works of large capacity&quot;.
CONFIDENTIAL. SHIP BUILDING AN D EN GIN BERING.SIR JOHN THORNYCROFT observed that the Argentine Naval Commission had sent out enquiries in this country in relation to a ship-building programme, but there was a matter in connection with these Commissions from foreign countries which tended to drive them to other countries  than our own.    They were attached to the Embassy, but did not get the privileges of the officers of the Embassy.   A Commission had been here for a number of years,  and the Naval Attache said he contemplated sending them to the Continent because they had to pay income tax on their salaries here.    On the Continent that would not apply; and as they had to pay Income tax in their own country,  they could not afford, to pay it twice.    Sir J. Thomycroft did not know whether it v/as possible to give some special consideration to the members of these foreign Commissions. On the other hand  the Continental countries actually offered them sugges tions and advice as to their shipbuilding programmes.    Our Admiralty, however, said they would be prepared to do the same thing, but  they felt it was not quite right for them to make suggestions or offer assistance.With regard to motor vehicles,  several oL&quot; the larger manufacturers had said that there was no hold-up yet, but that they were feeling the effects of the coal strike. Customers were meeting manufacturers  to some extent by taking the opportunity of ordering from them various things they could not get abroad.ELECTRICAL INDUSTRIES.SIR PHILIP NASH stated that the effect of the Coal Strike onthe electrical manufacturing business was now being felt more severely.    It had been surprising how well output had been keeping.up till quite recently, but now the effect of the strike was appreciable, partly due to restrictions on power and fuel, but mainly to the difficulty in getting specialised materials on which the electrical industries depended and which they did not produce themselves.   But probably the outcome of the strike would be realised later on even more than it was today, because for the last two months or so there had been a gradual falling off, almost to the point of extinction, of the small orders  that come into a business every day from industry.      The big electrical manufacturers were dependent to a great extent upon small orders, for delivery perhaps six or seven weeks ahead.   Now, since the beginning of the coal strike that class of business had dropped and dropped, until it had almost disappeared.    Of course it would come on again directly the strike was settled.   But there- must be, after the strike,  a certain period, say four or five weeks, during

Now, since the heginning of the coal strike that class of business had dropped and dropped, until it had almost disappeared.    Of course it would come on again directly the strike was settled.    But there- must be, after the strike,  a certain period, say four or five weeks, during
II438ELECTRICAL INDUSTRIES, (Contd.)which the reduced out-turn would continue, until these orders came In again.    The rate at which output was diminishing was not very serious, hut probably it had come down to about 60 per cent, of what it had been when the strike began;    and it would be well to realise that it was going to get worse for the time being.    In the meantime there was plenty of export business offering, and although foreign competitors were taking every possible advantage of the interruption in supply and the difficulty of firm delivery, Sir Philip Nash had not heard of this producing any definite effect in diverting orders from this country.COTTON.SIR W. CLARE LEES thought it was remarkable that industry, so far, had been able to carry on so well.    As concerned the particular sections of the cotton industry in which he was primarily interested, there had been no interruption for want of supplies.    There had been a very serious loss, of course, in making provision to carry on, but so far as the actual carrying on went, this proceeded as before. The volume of work that had been coming forward was.very little less than it had been before the strike.   Of course -it was a very reduced quantity then, but up to a week ago the volume for the bleaching side, which was the largest section, was not reduced by more than ten per cent. There had been some further reduction, perhaps, bringing it to twenty per cent, but they were able to keep their people working and drawing wages.      Further, very few, if any, contracts had been broken.So far as demand went, all new business was subject to a strike clause, and that was having a very deterrent effect.     Speaking of the Indian trade particularly,  the feature at the present moment was the strong tendency for India to go back to finer goods.    indeed, many of the finest qualities, which had gone out for years, were being again ordered in quite considerable volume.    The Indian manufacturers made these classes of goods to only a very small extent, if at all.COLONEL SEDDON BROWN regretted to report that the cotton trade was still in a very bad condition.    The sections spinning American cotton were still on short time.    Many mills had stopped their plant owing to the fact that business was unprofitable to start with, and they could not afford to pay the very high prices for coal or oil. Cloth was very difficult to get on the order books. There was only one bright spot, and that was that enquiry was quite good - from America and India as regards.fine qualities, - and from China.

Cloth was very difficult to get on the order books. There was only one bright spot, and that was that enquiry was quite good - from America and India as regards-fine qualities, - and from China.
COTTON (Contd. )The trade was still suffering from the fall in the price of cotton.    It was still sliding away.   This had been referred to many times at Council meetings.   American futures now stood at about 8-gd., and probably until we got to a price that established confidence in the world we could not hope for large business in the American section of the trade.   As cotton got cheaper it would be bound to help in the long run, but meanwhile there was a very painful process for the mills to go through, as most were carrying stocks.    Indeed many mills had now got almost to the end of their tether.    Cotton was the cheapest form of clothing in the world, and if it got on to a low price basis and the difference between It and wool and artificial silk became greater, it would be more attractive to people to purchase it.   But when prices rose near to those of artificial silk, people would go for the more showy article.At the meeting of the International Federation of Master Cotton Spinners and Manufacturers1 Associations held recently at Brussels, it appeared that the reports from every country on the Continent were bad.   Many of the countries had been doing quite well in the cotton textile trade, but it seemed that without exception every country on the Continent was now reporting very pessimistically. The fall in the price of cotton appeared to be affecting them in exactly the same way as it was affecting us.    They were still running longer hours than we were, but many mills were now pulling up.    They even went so far as to bring a resolution forward for international short time, but that was not carried; It would be an almost impossible thing to work, but It showed the trend of the trade on the Continent.WOOL.MR. ANDREWS recalled that last month the Council were Informed that the trouble in the woollen trade was not so much lack of coal as lack of orders.   That still continued to be the case.   They were getting foreign coal, and had up to the   -present been able to get all that wae really necessary. Sir Thomas Allen mentioned (see Co-operative Societies section) that sales of foodstuffs were down by 17 per cent, and of woollens by 3 0 per cent.   That showed that in a time like the present, the woollen trade, being more or less a luxury trade, was hit harder than perhaps any other.    They found that that was so.    They were badly hit on the cheaper class of goods; the dress trade In the better class of goods was really not very bad.   They had 50 to 60 per cent, of the machinery running; no goods were being made for stock; and once the industrial trouble was over the woollen trade should recover rapidly.    In Leicester and Nottingham trade was very bad.   They were dependent upon the summer trade just now, and a good deal of their selling was done at the seaside, and they were finding it very bad.
WOOL (Oontd.)Advices from Germany shewed that there was just as much worry over the position of the franc there as amongst ourselves.     Goods were going into Germany from Prance owing to the depreciation in the French currency, and that was putting the Germans out as regards prices just in about the same way as it was here.     It was very difficult to compare the conditions in the different processes of manu-facture, but there was always one branch in which definite comparisons could be made, and that was one where the work was done on commission, and practically the whole of the charge was one of wages - namely the Combing branch.   At present in France the cost of combing was only bQ$ of the cost here.In Bradford they were concerned at present about the next spring season,&apos; They had, of course, a winter season and a spring season.   Nearly all the orders in London for next spring season had been placed in France towards the end of last year.   The Bradford trade got the spring season orders this year simply because all the merchants had been afraid that a Safeguarding of Industries duty might be imposed.    Now that fear had been removed.   The placing of orders for next year with France would not be apparent in any Returns for a long time to come; but from Januery to June next year the probabilities were that Bradford would be hit very hardly indeed.COLONEL YULLEY said that in trying to scrutinise the position owing to the coal strike in the wool textile trade we were at a disadvantage because of a lack of statistics to show how it was affecting employment.    In the textile trade it was a case of under-employment rather than unemployment.    There was on the one hand a large amount of machinery standing idle, and on the other there were mills that were running a full week, though they might be running a very small part of their machinery.    It was difficult to gauge what proportion of the machinery was running.    &apos;I&apos;here had been a continuous stream of failures.    There were only eighty firms left in the weaving trade.    The rest had gone out of business , and their machinery was either broken up or derelict, and a large proportion of the looms in the wool textile trade were not running now, had not run for two or three years, and probably would not run again.   There was a tendency throughout the world to buy more from hand to mouth, and there was the serious handicap of the competition from France.The imports of raw wool into France for the period July, 1925 - April, 1926 were &amp;0% higher than they were In the corresponding period of 1924-25.    Further, our imports of wools and worsted tissues from France were nearly 20% higher in the year 1925 than they were in the year 1924.   As to Italy the figures for imports of raw wool into that country in 1925 showed 100% increase over those for 1913. Again, before the war our exports of alpaca and mohair yarns were 17,000,000 lbs.    In 1925 they were 8,000,000 lbs, and for the first five months of this year they had gone down to 2.000,000 lbs.    Our imports of raw mohair amounted to 28,000,000 lbs. in 1913, whereas for 1925 they were 13,Ooo,000 lbs., and during the five months of this year were only li/3rd. mill ion lbs.
WOOL (Contd.)On the question of statistics, Mr. T.W. Phillips remarked that the Ministry of Labour had recently been successful, owing to the cordial co-operation of the wool textile industry, in getting very excellent returns covering something like 60 per cent, of the employees.    The figures related to employment and wages, and were very complete: they were published in the Ministry of Labour Gazette.CHEMICALSMR. PERRY said that the coal situation was of course adominating influence in the chemical Industry, but whilst it had caused a general restriction of development and expansion, it had not yet seriously affected output and prices.    Stocks continued to be good and all orders could be promptly executed.    This, however, had only been achieved by the assistance of Imported coal.    The industry&apos;s overseas trade in May, 1926 was actually greater ia many commodities than in May, 1925j and, considering chemical and allied products as a whole, the balance of exports of home manufacture in excess of retained imports was  340,000 greater than in May, 1925*   lj-&apos;here was one point which it was again necessary to trouble the Council with, and that was the continued fall in the consumption of sulphuric acid. Our consumption w as now considerably below our pre-war figures, at least 20% less, and was not due in any way to the coal strike.    Seeing that our explosives programme was limited in the first 18 months of the war by our power to produce acid; and seeing that other countries such as America Instead of falling off in their consumption had more than doubled it, there seemed to be something in favour of regarding this problem from a national point of view. Mr. Perry had prepared an analysis which he was putting in to the Board of Trade, showing the causes of this disquieting situation.POTTERY.MR. ROLLINS had mentioned at the last meeting of the Council that if the coal crisis continued for another week we should reach a stoppage of workpeople in the pottery trade of about 662/3rds%&apos;.   The figure was approximating to that now.    A small proportion of this percentage would probably be going back to work for one or two days a week.    One could not expect the effect of the coal stoppage on our pottery exports to be shown in the May returns;    as a matter of fact, it was believed that tho exports to America had somewhat increased during that period, but June would be the critical month to show this, and the effects of the stoppage.
POTTERY (Contd.)Of the one-third of the industry which was still running, some of the larger firms which had fairly good stocks of coal, would carry on for a few weeks, probably, but among the others there would be a further closing down.   A little imported coal was coming in, for use in the Pottery industry.CO-OPERATIVE SOCIETIES.SIR THOMAS ALLEN said that the distributive trade hadnaturally been affected by the diminished purchasing power of the people.    The figures of the trade done by the Co-operative Wholesale Society indicated, for* the four weeks in May 1926, as compared with the corresponding period last year, a decrease in foodstuffs of 17;$, in coal 17%, in general drapery 45$. in woollens 30jo, in boots and shoes 36%, and In furnishing 43%&apos;.    One pleasing feature was thut wholesale and retail prices of commodities were generally at a lower level.    Sir Thomas thought that on the average they were&apos; down about to 5/v.    The onearticle in which wholesale and retail prices had advanced was bacon, owing probably to the embargo on the importation of Dutch pigs, due to the prevalence of foot and mouth disease on the Continent.    It was unfortunate that the British producer was not in a position to take- advantage of this situation.    If he would only make up his mind to it, he could improve our position and his own by giving greater attention to pig breeding, to ease the situation arising out of the embargo.MR, GALLACHER desired to indicate, from the figures of theScottish Co-operative wholesale Society for the period ended. June 26th, 192 6, the effect of the coal stoppage on other trades.   Up to the time when the stoppage began the Society was doing fairly well, but there was a considerable falling off immediately the stoppa^  took place.    There was, however, quite a remarkable recovery towards the end of June, and the last week of the half year showed an increase of 8% over the corresponding week of 1925.    That seemed to be very remarkable.   There was a slight increasa In drapery, but the greater part of it was in groceries and foods.    Over the six months there was a total decrease amounting to only 3-g-$, and of that the grocery departments contributed 2-j% and the other departments round about 1^. One rather significant feature indicative of bad trade, was shown in the Increase of the debts to the Society by its affiliated Societies.   The debts a year ago, on June 27th 1925, were  250,480, whereas on June 23th, 1926 they amounted to  497,772,   Even the higher figure only amounted to about eight days&apos; trade of the Wholesale Society and it did not follow that it was a bad debt, because most of it was covered by share and loan capital held by the Wholesale Society against these Societies j but It was an evidence of the scarcity of money in the retail Societies.
C QNFIDE BT IAL.CO-OPERATIVE SOCIETIES (Contd. )The general trade of the Society was certainly rather slow iiow, &quot;out it was a significant feature that they had not experienced the same diff Iculty during this strike as they had in former coal strikes.    They had not been asked, for instance, to lend money.    Retail Societies had been making generous donations, but there had not been the organised lending of money to the miners and the miners1 Unions that took place on some previous occasions.   The economic life of Scotland did not seem to be much disturbed looking at it from the surface.    It was very remarkable that things were going on so well in spite of the stoppage of the chief industry in Scotland, which had now entered on its tenth week.   They were undoubtedly doing trade from hand to mouth, and the retail Societies were placing orders very sparingly, but things were very much better than had been anticipated.    with the finish of the strike they looked for a tremendous Impetus to Co-operative trading, because, the stocks of the retail Societies were so depleted.GENERAL TRADE.SIR MAX MUSPRATT confirmed what had been said (see section on Employment) about employment keeping up, and added that demand 7/as also keeping up.    It was difficult to know exactly whether that would continue or not.    His own impression was that, at any rate for a few weeks still, it would increase, and that there would be more employment and more demand for manufactured goods, because a good many manufacturers, In anticipation of a possible coal stoppage, had been running up manufactured stocks, and during May and June those manufactured stocks had been practically depleted.   During that same period there had been coal control limiting manufacture to about 50;t; hut they could now get foreign fuel without restriction, and everyone understood that there was not the slightest Intention of interfering with the quantities of industrial fuel that might be used, so long as it came from abroad.The President hopod that this was clearly understood by all users.Sir Max Muspratt believed that it was.    Having this foreign fuel, they would be able to manufacture considerably more than the proportion of 50%; he thought that it would be more like 70;? in July.    They were manufacturing because they must keep consumers served If they possibly could; and, apart from certain industries - Iron and steel in particular - Sir Max believed that most trades would bo manufacturing rather more in July than they had done in either May or June,    But the financial problem was quite a serious one.    For instance, a large amount of business was done upon annual contracts.    Of course they had a strike clause, but it was very difficult to decide whether
GENERAL TRADE (Contd. )to put that strike clause into effect or not, and it appeared that, in the main, manufacturers were not availing them-selves of the strike clause but were themselves carrying the losses or reduced profits, as the case might be, for the present.   How long they could go on with that it would be hard to say.On the financial side there was a point that Sir Max Muspratt would like some advice upon from the banking members of the Council.    This was about the period of the year when interim dividends were either declared or not, and the question was whether, assuming that an interim dividend could be paid without any appreciable draw out of accumulated reserves, it was a sound transaction to pay one, or not. From the point of view of the individual industry it might be quite sound, but would the psychological effect of paying dividends at the present time improve our credit; and what would the psychological effect upon the working man be?   It would be all to the good if the -workers of this country realised, as many of them did, that they were the first people hit in the  case of industrial trouble, and It might be a very wise thing if those Industrial Companies that could do so would pay their dividends as if nothing had happened.Mr. Currie thought that it would be wiser policy not to pay in the circumstances, and that the moral effect would be-better if it were recognised that you could not have a strike of this kind, and go on as usual.    And the Companies would certainly be In a stronger position if they conserved their reserves and did not spend the money on dividends.The President considered that most people were Impressed by the general stability of a Company rather than by a particular interim dividend being declared, particularly If such a payment was not justified by the trading returns and reserves.   As to the effect on the community,what was best for the community was a sound financial policy.    We v/anted to go forward when this industrial trouble was over with a bold policy, to recover our position in the markets of the world; and for that we wanted resources.Mr. Gallacher said that the Co-operative Society had acted on a principle largely similar to that alluded to by Sir Max Muspratt.    The Society realised that working people would be concerned if their dividend was not somewhere near the average level.   A retail Co-operative Society might be perfectly sound, but if it considerably diminished the dividend, it might cause something like a panic, and the Wholesale Society&apos;s advice to the retail Societies was to create a dividend reserve fund.    There should always be a certain amount of floating profit as reserve, so as to make the dividends as far as possible uniform over each successive period.    They thought that any big business should try to have some reserve, so as to keep things going when the need arrived.   That fwas the purpose of reserves, and there was no reason why those reserves should not be used to supplement dividends.    The two Co-operative Wholesale Societies endeavoured to have always a uniform dividend.    It could not always be achieved, but when possible it was always well to have it.
GENERAL TRADE (Contd.)MR. VYLE did not support the optimism shewn by some of the other members of the Council.    The reports received by the Chambers of Commerce showed that the general commercial situation was substantially worse than it was when the Council last met.    Many of the firms which were carrying on then had . stocks of coal, but now it was reported from several quarters that important contracts which might have been placed had been delayed, and in one or two cases had been cancelled, through lack of coal.    The stocks of British coal had almost all gone, and while there was a good supply of foreign coal coming in, it did not seem to penetrate to a good many of the firms In the midlands.Southampton, curiously enough, reported that trade was normal and unemployment decreasing.    This might be due to the fact that some of the bigger liners called at Southampton on the homeward voyage from other countries on the way to Germany; the North German Lloyd were doing that.    It was also interesting to note that the glove trade at Worcester was &apos; prosperous.    They said that fruit was likely to have a bad season, but they anticipated a good season for hops.The motor trade generally was being adversely affected. Everyone had looked forward to, and reckoned on, a. very great increase&apos; in their business in M-ay and June, and this had not materialized.    The fact that the trade was still carrying on, however, and still doing a percentage of what they were doing before the industrial trouble, was satisfactory.    Generally, the position was much worse than it had been at the time of the Council meeting last month; but there was the feeling that as soon as this coal business was settled a general recovery would take place rapidly.SIR STANLEY MAC HI N wrote:-&quot;I fear I have no very encouraging report to give. The unfortunate position of the coal industry is naturally holding up enterprise in all directions, and everybody seems inclined to look on.    On the other hand, signs are not wanting that when the present coal crisis is past there will be a revival in industry for which all are so anxiously waiting.    There undoubtedly appears to be trade awaiting so soon as confidence is restored.    The export markets continue steady, and here again I believe we may look for favourable development at an early date.&quot;CONDITIONS IN EUROPE.MR. BRAND had been in Central Europe for a few weeks.    He found that in Austria, Czecho-Slovak!a and Hungary the industrial depression was very great.    They said they had too much plant.    They were also very much affected by the depression of the franc and the lira, and particularly so by the tariffs between the different countries.    They all expressed an opinion in favour of lower duties, and were making commercial agreements, but the tariff tendency was still&apos;upwards,    then Mr. Brand was in Czecho-Slovakia, Parliament was increasing largely their duties on agricultural products.    He saw Dr. Benes and. asked him whether the
CONFIDENTIAL.448CONDITIONS IN EUROPE (Contd. )tendency really wae downwards.   The latter said that it was, and that these particular increased duties were a step in the direction of lower duties all round; he was only forging a weapon to bring lower duties elsewhere.   But as they were all engaged In forging weapons, the result was not very good.    The effect on the banking situation was, of course, that most of the banks were locked up.    The banks were, so to speak, Industrial investment companies as well as simply banks.    In Czecho-Slovakia there were far too many banks.   Every Industry had created its own, and the Czecho-Slovakian Government had recently provided  10,000,000 to keep all the bad banks going, or to prevent the community suffering heavy losses; and the good banks had to subscribe a certain proportion of their profits to pay the interest on these Government bonds that had been handed over to the bad banks.    It was a wrong situation.Money was a good deal easier in all those parts.    In Vienna a depositor got nearly Gf- per cent, for three months deposit,which3vasconsiderably lower than it had been, and was due presumably to the depression.    Owing to the comparative height of the English bank and discount rate compared to rates in Switzerland, Holland and the United States, a great deal of financing that had been done in London during the last few years would probably this year be done elsewhere.    For instance, the Czecho-SlQvaklan sugar crop and other crops would probably be financed more largely elsewhere than In London.In Hungary there had been the big collapse of the Victoria Mills which threatened the loss of a large sum of money for London, but there again the Government had come to the assistance of the concern, and perhaps no one would lose very much,   ^he milling industry, like other industries, was being affected by tariffs.   The Hungarian milling industry used to be one of the best In Europe, but now Hungary could only export wheat and not flour, because there were large duties in other countries against flour.Conditions in Germany were looking better.    It was said that the big Coal Mines had got to a profit-making basis before our strike took place, and were now making very large profits as the result of that strike.    No company was paying dividends and the coal concerns took the opportunity last year not to pay any dividends either, but to build up their reserves.In France It appeared doubtful whether the experts&apos; report would be accepted, and the French hid two main feelings - one was complete unanimity against the Washington agreement, at any rate unless the Americans agreed not to put the French bonds on the market, and the other was a very strong feeling against accepting loans from England or America because of the danger of what thoy regarded as Anglo-Saxon financial domination.BANKING.HR. CURRIS observed that rates for money had been well maintained and the bill rate was lower than one would expect under the circumstances.    He thought that this was due to the expectation that the bank rate would fall, and-IS-
CONFIDENTIAL.        &apos; 44?BANKING (Contd.)and perhaps that would have happended but for the coal strike.   Deposits were slightly lower, as far as could he estimated.SHIPPING.SIR ALAN ANDERSON said that the general level of freights in May was about 6% lower than in May last year, and slightly lower than it was in 1913.   When one took into account also the value of the  , which was something like one-third lower, It showed the present freight level to be very bad indeed.    The particular disturbance of the strike had, of course, brought higher freights incertain trades. The freight homeward from America had been something like 9/- a ton before the strike, and now it had gone up to about 15/-.   There had been a certain rise In the outward freights to America, also.    The tonnage under construction was considerably less than it had been a year ago.Sir Alan had been in Greece recently and found that there were very few Greek trampships laid up.    A certain number of liners were laid up, however.    It was said that the Greek owner was making quite a good living out of the freight market now, whereas the British owner certainly was not.    Sir Alan Anderson also mentioned a number of matters of Imperial and International Interest, for consideration of the Board of Trade,RAILWAY TRAFFIC..MR. fflJRCCMB observed that the effect of the strike wasroflecoed in the large decrease in gross receipts of the railways.    The gross receipts for the 17 weeks ending 2nd May, just before the strike, had shown an Increase of about  1,000,000 sterling, the greater part of which was in freight receipts.    The traffics up to the end of April had shown a substantial increase of nearly 3,500,000 tone, of which 2,750,000 was in coal,  - part of which was no doubt moved in anticipation of a stoppage.    No later figures of tonnage were available.-EMPLOYMENT.MR. PHILLIPS observed that the remarkable thing about the unemployment figures was the smallness of the Increase. Comparing the 24th May and the 28th June, the total increased by only about 41,000, and it was noticeable that very little, of this increase had occurred among persons wholly unemployed, - who were only 3,500 more numerous at the end of the period than at the beginning. Those temporarily stopped increased by 29,600, and unemployed casuals hy 8,000.   The term &quot;temporarily
CONFIDENTIAL* EMPLOYMENT (Contd.).stopped&quot; applied to people who had not been discharged from their employment but had been put off.    That covered a fairly wide range of circumstances, but broadly it meant persons who were on short time, wholly off for particular days, but expecting to go back at some more or less definite date, or who were working perhaps three days a week, and so on.    Figures had been taken out to show how the total increase of about 650,000 unemployed since the end of April,  (comparing the 28th June, the latest date for which we had figures, with the 2?th April, the date just before the stoppage) had been distributed over the country.    In the South of England the increase was 18^; in the rest of England 90^, including about 150^ in the Midlands; in Scotland 30^, and in Wales over 100%. Comparing the 28th June with the 24th May, there was an actual decrease in the South of England and in Scotland, and increases in the rest of the country.Some figures giving a comparison with the stoppage in 1921 might be of interest*    It had to be remembered that in 1921 the stoppage took place when industry was very rapidly getting worsej this year it took place when, as far as one could see, it was getting better. The dispute started in 1921 with a live register of 1,700,000 and this year with a live register of just under 1,000,000.   At the end of the first month in 1921 the increase over and above the 1,700,000 was 550,000j at the end of the first month this year it was 630,000, that is 80,000 more. At -the end of the second month in 1921 the increase was 850,000) this year it was 650,000.    The more rapid increase this year at the beginning was doubtless due to the general stoppage which brought out about 500,000 people within three weeks, but after that it seemed to be pretty clear that the increase, in spite of the fact that we started from a much lower figure, was a good deal less than in 1921.AUSTRALIAN TRADE.MR. SANDERSON remarked that the position in Australia had not altered much in the past month. There had been some rain in the South, but the northern part of Queensland had been suffering severely from drought.    The coming wool clip was estimated at 2*242,000 bales, of which about a million and a quarter were to be offered before Christmas and about a million afterwards.    There was a movement in New South Wales in regard to the manufacture of motor cars. A Company was being formed with a capital of  1,000,000 for the mass production of Australian cars.    They had put forward a request for a bounty, Which would probably be favourably considered.INDIAN TRADE.MR. LINDSAY had just received from India the Terms of Reference to the new Tariff Board regarding the cotton textile&quot; industry inquiry.    That inquiry -had .been Instituted at the request of-the-Bombay millowners in order to examine the oauseB of the present depression in the Bombay and Ahmedabad centres.    The procedure was that, on the industry coming to Government, the Government referred the inquiry to the Tariff
INDIAN TRADE (Contd.).Board, the Tariff Board would report to the Government, and the Government would put the position before the Assembly. Very briefly, the Tariff Board had been Instructed by Government to investigate the condition of the cotton textile industry in India with special reference to the industry in Bombay and Ahmedabad.    (As one might expect, It was chiefly in the coast towns that the industry was seriously affected. The cotton mill industry up country in India was to some extent protected from overseas competition by railway freights from the coast.) &apos; The Tariff Board was also to examine the causes of the depression in the industry and to report whether they were of a temporary or permanent character; in particular, to consider whether, and If so to what extent, the depression was due to the competition of other countries in the home and export trade; and to report whether the industry is in need of protection and if so in what form and for what period protection should be given.As regards the up country mills, these had the protection, as against -jnills in coast towns, of being nearer the cotton producing centres, the up country markets, and so getting their raw material nearer to the sources of supply.    They were closer to the consuming centres and also to the big Indian coalfields;    indeed, almost every factor in the cost of marketing was in their favour as compared with Bombay, and, of course,    the wages up country were lower.    Indian cotton was now within a very short&quot; margin of American middling. Of good cotton, Tinnevellys were on^  about 100 points off middling American.    Before the war they must have been about 150 or more.   And yet India seemed to be able to sell her cotton to Japan without much difficulty.    The exports to Japan so far this   year were actually higher than during the same period of the year before.The position in regard to the jute industry was interesting at the moment.    The jute crop for several years past had been distinctly short, but last year it appeared to have been under-estimated by the local authorities in India. Last year, the area under jute was about 3,000&apos;000 acres, and the output was estimated at just under 8,000,000 bales; but already over 9,000,000 bales had been marketed in Calcutta, so tjbat there, was a distinct under-estimate of 1,000,000 bales. The forecast of the new crop had only just been published. The, area was 3,300,000 acres, showing an advance of 600,000 acres Over last year; and as last year&apos;s weather conditions were distinctly bad, it was probable that there would be a normal, or more than normal crop this year.    It was estimated, so far, at between 10 and loj? million bales, as compared with an estimated 8 and actual 9 million bales last year.The news of the monsoon was not particularly good.    There had been one or two alarming telegrams from India, one to the effect that only three or four inches of rain had been experienced so far in Bombay, as compared with 22 inches which are normally counted upon by the end of the first month; but there had probably been a good deal of exaggeration over that. The monsoon might be starting late;, that did not affect us very much.    The important thing was that it should go on late. At present there was really no ground for: apprehension, and the crop reports so far were quite good all over India except only in the Punjab and In Bombay.
CONFIDENTIAL.450SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE.MR. HOSE wrote:-&quot;The volume of cereal exports from Argentina has shown continued expansion, and the increased shipments havp tended to bring about a slight improvement in the general commercial situation. Conditions in the import market, however, are still far from satisfactory, and this is especially so in the case of the textile trade,  the extreme lassitude of which has given rise to some anxiety.    Recent advices received from Buenos Avres indicate that further failures among the smaller textile houses are anticipated,  and there seems little prospect of improvement until the absorption of the existing heavy stocks ha-3 adjusted the disparity between supply and demand.    In a somewhat lesser degree,  similar conditions prevail in the hardware markets.&quot;In the course of his address to Congress on 21st May, the Chilean President stated that, at the end of 1925, the total general deficit in the national finances amounted to $144,586,752, and that this amount had been increased during the current year to $189,586,752.    It is hoped to reduce this deficit by effecting economies in expenditure, and by a more efficient application of the existing income-tax regulations.    Proposals are also under consideration for raising additional revenue by the imposition of duties on exports of frozen meat, skins and wool from Punta Arenas.&quot;There is little change to report in the nitrate position, and producers are awaiting some indication that the Chilean Government is prepared to co-operate with them, by reducing the export duties and thus placing Chilean nitrate on a more competitive basis with the synthetic product.&quot;The outstanding feature of the political situation has been the breakdown of the negotiations to determine the sovereignty of the Tacna-Arica provinces, following a ruling by the head of the United States Mediation Mission that the proposed plebiscite was impracticable.    It is to be regretted that these protracted negotiations - which have cost both countries large sums which they could very ill afford - should have culminated so indecisively, and. there can be little doubt that the failure of President Coolidge&apos;s mediatory efforts has adversely affected the prestige of the United States in Latin America.&quot;In my last report to the Council, I referred to the proposals for stabilising the Brazilian exchange, and expressed the opinion that although such attempts were not always successful, they would be so in the case of Brazil. Colour is given to this view by the recent sharp appreciation in the exchange value of the milreis, which is now quoted at 7^/Z2cl. -the highest rate touched since 1921.    Recent utterances by the President indicate clearly that stabilisation is a paramount consideration in the mind of the Government, and, as a budget surplus has been established for the first time for many years,  there is some justification for anticipating a stabilised exchange in the near future at around the level aimed at, namely, 8d.    It may be noted that a Brazilian Government loan of U.S. $25,000,000 In 6-ifo Bonds was successfully placed in New York on 24th June at an issue price of 90-f.    This issue represents the balance of an external loan of $60^000,000 recently authorised by the Brazilian Government, of which an amount of $55,000,000 was issued in New York in May last.
SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE (Contd.).&quot;Recent reports from Sao Paulo state that the textile trade In that part of Brazil is depressed, and that the factories have been compelled to make drastic reductions in their outputa.&quot;The commercial situation in Peru has been affected by the weak tendency of the exchange, which has exerted an unfavourable influence upon import markets.    Recently, however, the Peruvian pound has appreciated in value, and, if the improvement Is maintained, a corresponding betterment of buainess conditions generally may be looked for. Apart from this factor, the position is fairly satisfactory.    There are excellent prospects of record crops, and the low prices ruling for cotton and sugar will probably be offset by increased yields from the approaching harvest.FAR EASTERN TRADE.MR. LANDALE said that British Shipping on the China Coast and the Yangtsze was fairly well employed, but the Ports of Swatow and Canton still remained closed and the anti-foreign feeling in Szechwan was    interfering with business in the Upper ^angtsze.    The wharfs and godowns of the British Companies in Canton were lying idle, and there was much congestion in the harbour and at the Customs House.    No progress had been made in the negotiations between Hongkong and Canton for settlement of the so-called Strike and Boycott.imports^ The diminished purchasing power of the Chinese, blue to the civil disturbances, and their inability to export their produce, was now making itsSlf felt and the demand for imports was only a small one. Very heavy losses had been incurred on goods whici^ were held up owing to the recent disturbances and ha-d now to be sold with replacement costs lower by 15$, and a considerably lower exchange.Exports.    There was a small business doing, but trade was still1 very much interfered with by the difficulty In moving merchandise on the railways in China..    There was a demand for crushing seeds from the Continent a few weeks ago which had now died down.    A good business was still being done in raw silk both to America and France.Railways.    The Railways from Shanghai to Hanking and Shanghai to rTingpo and Hangohow were doing well.    The traffic on the lower portion of the Tientsin Pukow Railway ?ras reported to have been reorganised, but no attempt had yet been made to meot foreign obligations.    The Peking Mukden Railway was still in a state of chaos.Engineering.    More business was being transacted and there was a goodoleal more enquiry.Political. The political outlook generally was very uncertain.
