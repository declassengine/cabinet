LOOTHSNT IS THE PROPERTY Og HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; 3 government ^SHT.ret. -&apos; Copy No.218(26). CABINET.jEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER 0^ AGRICULTURE AMD PI SHE RIBS.Introduction of Foot-and-Mouth Disease by ^resh Meat &quot; from the Continent.1.       I have to call the urgent attention of the Cabinet to the faot that definite proof has been obtained within the last few days that the importation of fresh meat  from the Continent has produced Foot-and-Mouth Disease in this country.2.       An outbreak of the disease at Carluke, Lanarkshire, was traced to an adjoining Bacon factory which has been receiving carcases of freshly killed pigs from Belgium.     Three of the carcases at this  factor?/ revealed lesions of Foot-and-Mouth Disease, and diseased carcases from the same consignment have been found at three other premises in Scotland and one in England. The disease has already spread to cattle on seven separate farms at Carluke.3.       Lesions of the disease have also been found in the carcases of Dutch pigs in a ship which has since arrived at Leith. I have prohibited the landing of any part of the cargo of this ship.4.       It is evident therefore that there is a serious danger in allowing the importation of fresh meat from countries where Foot-and-mouth Disease is prevalent, as is the case all over the Continent.     No system of inspection can be effective, since the most dangerous infection comes from the carcases of animals killed in the incubative stages of the disease, which show no visible lesions on the carcases.5. V% know from recent inquiries made by one of our Veterinary Inspectors abroad that in Denmark, 3 1 glum and Holland pigs and pig offals from farms on which Foot-and-Mouth
Disease occurs are constant!?? sent to slaughter-houses for export to this country.     The whole of this trade constitutes a very serious danger, and so lone as it is allowed to continue we cannot hope to be free from constant outbreaks of the disease, which has cost the country over  4,500,000 since the serious recurrence of the disease in 1922.6.       I desire therefore the authority of the Cabinet to make an Order at once prohibiting absolutely the importation of any fresh meat or offals from the Continent of Europe.     No lesser measure will give us any adequate safeguard or will satisfy the agricultural oommunity.7.      Such en Order will principally affect the trade in pork and in bacon pigs from Holland and Belgium, in pig offals from Denmark and in veal from Holland.     The quantity of fresh beef, mutton and lamb imported from the Continent is negligible.8.       The quantity of fresh pork imported may amount to 10 per cent, of the total supply, and Its stoppage would no doubt raise prices for a time.     But prohibition would at once stimulate increased breeding in this country, and the deficiency should be made up In a few months.     At this time of year the consumption of pork decreases, and prohibition would cause less inconvenience than at any other time.     There may also be some temporary rise in the price of veal in the London market, which is largely dependent on Dutch supplies.9.       I feel that I have no alternative but to ask the Cabinet to be prepared to face the outcry which prohibition of importation vi 11 entail for a time.     If action on the lines I recommend is not taken, there will be a far greater outcry from the agricultural community who in spite of compensation are now suffering heavy loss from restrictions on their business and our efforts to keep the country free from   disease will be nullified.W. a..stry of Agriculture and Fisheries, 10, Whitehall Place, S.W.1.1st June, 1926.
