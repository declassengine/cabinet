THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.1.     As the Cabinet are aware, considerable attention has been drawn by the Press and by private observers in recent months to industrial conditions in the United States,    The great public interest in the subject Is Indicated by the large sale of the book written by Messrs. Austin and Lloyd after a visit to important manufacturing centres, and by the fact that three newspapers have sent investigators to the United States and are making a special feature of their reports.     One of these, the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; , sent out a mission of eight workers in the engineering and kindred trades to enquire into the Industrial conditions in the United States and to acquire first-hand Information regarding working conditions, hours, wages and the use of up-to-date machinery in representative American Industrial establishments.     A letter written to the &quot;Times&quot; by Colonel Willey, ex-President of the Federation of British Industries, has also been the subject of much discussion.    In all these cases It has been stated, almost without qualification, that as regards systems of working, industrial relationships and the general conditions of the working classes, the position in the United States is far superior to that in this oountry and that there is much which could be applied here with advantage both to employers and employed.     On the other hand, the report of Mr. Purcell, a member of the Trade Union Congress General Council, on his visit to the United States in the company of Mr. Swales, ex-Chairman of the Council and a member of the Amalgamated Engineering Union, criticised from the workers&apos; point of view the conditions In that oountry.     Although they are on the left wing of the Council,SECRET^ CP.535(26) .CABINET.Memorandum by the Minister of Labour.ENQUIRY INTO INDUSTRIAL RELATIONSHIPS IN AMERICA,
their statement of the facts as they saw them probably carries greater weight among organised workers than those of other observers who are regarded as looking at the matter mainly from the employers&apos; point of view.2.     There may be much in the American system of regulating industrial conditions which could be profitably applied to this country but so far there has been no authoritative investigation by persons who have been closely associated with the problems of industrial relationships in this country and whose statement of the facts would be likely to carry weight among those engaged in Industry,     In my opinion the Government ought to be in possession of the results of an unbiassed and authoritative enquiry into conditions in the United States, with special regard to working conditions and industrial relationships, in order that, as soon as possible, the methods adopted in that country may be brought under serious discussion in the settlement of our own problems,5,     For this purpose I would suggest that a Mission composed of two representative employers, two representatives of Trade Unions, together with an independent Chairman and a small secretariat, should be sent to the United, States in the early autumn.     This number would allow a division of forces which would enable most of the main industrial centres to be Investigated within a period of about fourteen weeks.    I would suggest that their report should be confined to the facts and that, to avoid a division of opinion which might detract from the value of the report, the Mission should not* in their report, attempt to formulate any conclusions.      I estimate that the cost of such e Mission would be about  5,000.4.      The need of an authoritative and more exact statement on American conditions is, in my opinion, a matter of growing importance.     Industry generally in this country will be faced
with many difficulties as a result of the coal stoppage, and we should lose no opportunity that presents itself of directing the attention of employers and workpeople to any matters that may assist in overcoming those difficulties.     Moreover, the circumstances following the collapse of the general strike and the prolongation of the coal stoppage seem likely to create a state of mind favourably disposed towards the kind of ideas which are said to account for so much of the success and prosperity of American industry,     I should be glad, therefore, to have the agreement of my colleagues to the above proposal. An early decision is desirable as it will necessarily take some time to select suitable persons to form the Mission and to prepare the ground for their work.(Intd)    A. S-M.Ministry of Lab our &amp; June 11th,  192b.
