I would also draw attention to the opinion expressed by Sir Philip Nash;, on behalf of the electrical manufacturing industry, that it is vital to pass the Electricity Bill without delay,    I have already communicated this view to the Attorney General and the Minister of Transport.Mr. Lindsayfs appreciation of Indian prospects are again of interest *(IntldK    P.C-L.15th June, 1926.

IRON AND STEEL .MR o DORMAN wrote: -&quot;During the month of April the production of pig iron amounted to 539,100 tons as compared with 568,500 tons in March, and 569.,800 tons in April., 1925.    There were 147 furnaces in blast at the end of April, a nett decrease of 4 since the beginning of that month.&quot;The production of steel ingots and castings amounted in &quot;April to 661,000 tons as compared with 784,100 tons in March and 597,600 tons in April 1925;    the decline in production between March and April was largely due to Easter Holidays&quot;..After referring to the effect of the Coal Stoppage on the Iron and Steel Industries (see tho section of these notes on the Coal Stoppage) Mr, Dorman concluded as follows&quot;It is impossible to give any indication as to what steps will be taken by Iron and Steel Manufacturers to resume normal operations at the end of the present industrial dispute. Any increase in the present cost of coal will, however, materially affect costs of production and will cause many firms to seriously consider the advisability of the resumption of operations&quot;.MR. BAKER wrote :-&quot;Before the coal stoppage came about, our officials were reporting a falling off in orders;    this of course, might have been consequential upon the disturbed atmosphere at the time.&quot;Prices appear to have continued to fall and   there is a further reduction of wages,  apparently 4$, for all those whose wages are governed by the Smelters North of England Sliding Scale;    this brings wages down to 22?$ on, and as there was l3f^ on at July 50th 1914, this means that the net Increase has been 8f$ as against the increased cost of living of 67.00&quot;.SPECIAL  STEEL.SIR ARTHUR BALFOUR stated that the effect of the General Strike in the Sheffield district had proved to be quite good. The employers and employed were having closer relations with one another and talking with one another in quite a different way from that of recent years.    The export orders that had come in both by mail and by cable In the last four weeks were better than they had been for a very long time,  and if it had not been for the coal stoppage one would have expected, so far as Sheffield was concerned, that June and July would have been very good months for export.   However, orders were still coming in. A certain number had been cancelled, but  almost entirely in cases where the capital was American or partly American. In Bolivia and Mexico,  for instance, they had cancelled orders pretty widely, placing them in the United States. But generally the cancellation of orders had not been as serious as might have been expected.
SPECIAL STEEL (Contd).The Canadian trad.e wa3 keeping up,  although the Americans were cutting prices very hard, and that was diminishing the profit. Australia and New Zealand were good;    Japan steadily improving;    and In spite of the condition of China, the Sheffield manufacturers had quite a fair trade there. In Belgium there was serious difficulty on account of the position of the franc. So far, our people had maintained their position in Belgium, but were now being threatened with their customers buying from France at prices they could not possibly compete with. The trade with France was practically closed altogether. That with Germany had fallen off again   very seriously.   With the United States very little was being done since the General Strike, except in a few special cases. On the other hand the South American trade was very good and improving constantly.    or.s trade was being done with Russia, but the terms whleh were being given by many people to Russia were perfectly ridiculous.    They would not give them to anybody   else, not even to manufacturers in this country - they extended up to two years.    SO far, bills had been paid regularly, but the amount of credit outstanding at the present time was very heavy.NON-FERROUS METALS.SIR CECIL BUDD observed that, in the base metals trades, orders had been lost to the Continent during our industrial troubles of late.    The trade was steady and, he thought,  slightly improving when they broke out, and - at any rate as far as home orders were concerned - there appeared to be a prospect of a decided improvement when the Coal Stoppage was settled and things began to get normal again.SHIPBUILDING AND ENGINEERING.SIR JOHN THORNEYCROFT stated that while orders had been placed during the last month for a number of high-class vessels, shipbuilders generally were in an unsatisfactory position. The Argentine Government, which years ago were good customers for warships, had voted money for a small programme. There would no doubt be very keen competition from Continental and American firms who secured the orders for the last vessels which were built for the Argentine Navy before the War.    There seemed to be some anxiety on the part of the Admiralty at the failure of British firms to secure foreign warship orders,   as a letter recently had been sent to firms advising them that there appeared to be an impression that the Admiralty were not willing to give the same facilities as were given in foreign countries,  and that the fact that firms were building for the British Government was not to be regarded as a reason  or preventing them showing foreign Government representatives their Works, provided that proper precautions as regards secrecy were maintained. At the present time the owner of the only shipbuilding plant In South Ameriea   which was capable of building or repairing the smaller type of war vessel was asking Sir J.ThorneycrOft1s firm,  in combination with others,  to supply designs for machinery and material to enable him to build a destroyers
SHIPBUILDING AND ENGINEERING (Gontd.).He said he must he given three years&apos; credit, and that if we could not do it in this country he had offers from Continental firms.German firms were very energetic in their endeavours to secure business In South America,  and were negotiating at the present time to equip a locomotive works in Brazil capable of an output of about 50 locomotives a year and to provide the skilled men necessary to run it,  the only obliga-tion on the part of the Brazilian firm with whom they were arranging the business being that they should obtain their supplies of material and forgings from them,  long terms of payment being accepted for the material; the payment for the plant for the factory was to he made by charging dfe on the sale price of the locomotives which were sold to the Brazilian Government.   For an order for 4 Diesel Motor Ships whioh had been placed in Italy an Exports Credit Scheme had been specially arranged, the only security which the Government got being that of the ships themselves.With regard to the Motor &quot;Vehicle Industry, the Association of British Motor Manufacturers were urging very strongly the advisability of uniformity in the percentage of British or Dominion labour to qualify for Empire preference, and that the percentage should not only be increased but be on the chassis alone.    This would be advantageous from the british manu-facturers&apos; point of view,  as many cars were coming into this country which obtained the preference solely on their body and paint.   As regards foreign orders, the Greek government who had said they proposed to&apos; institute a trial of various makes of vehicles with a view to deciding on a type for their Army requirements, which would amount to about 500 vehicles, had announced that they had placed their order with the lasit Automobilfabrik A,G. Dusseldorf and the Hansa-Lloyd Werke A.G. Bremen for 450 at a total value of about  380,000. Several British firms prepared vehicles in anticipation of the trials, but the British Government representatives in Athens were discouraging,  stating that the Greek Government could not afford the expenditure.    It would seem worth ascertaining if motor vehicles for Army purposes could not correctly be classified as &quot;war material&quot;, and Germany debarred from supplying them.It was too early to express any definite opinion of what the effect of the duty on Commercial Motors would be, as very large numbers had apparently been specially imported, but there was no question that it must help the British manu-facturers,  a number of whom reported that they had been approached by agents who formerly were only interested in foreign makes.    Sir John Thomeycroft reported that American manufacturers apparently were convinced that import duties would be imposed on many more classes of goods than at present, and had been for some time investigating the best parts of the country to put down factories for different industries,  and the
IllSHIPBUILDING a ENGINEERING (Contd.).American Commercial Attaches here had been supplying very valuable information.    So many enquiries had been made that the authorities in America had become anxious and had given instructions to the commercial Attaches here that they were to cease giving information, as they did not want to encourage too many manufacturers to establish branches in Great Britain, which would be detrimental to American industry and employment.    The classes of manufacture which had taken the greatest interest in the matter were special Patent Foods and Dry Cereals,  the Automobile Industry, and Printing.    The fact that these investigations had been made did not imply that tariff modification was anticipated in the immediate future, as it seemed the recognised policy of the more important organisations in America to make plans for new factories up to 10 years ahead.    A British Architect who had been working for a concern with large factories both in America and in this country had recently been making a special comparison of the costs of building in both countries and had arrived at the conclusion that factory buildings in this country were, at the present time, from 15 to 20fo more expensive than they were in America.ELECTRICAL TRADES.SIR PHILIP NASH said that export business in the heavy industries was satisfactoryj an increasing amount of export work was coming to this country, although the prices might not be remunerative.    He had not heard of any cancellation of orders, but it was found that,  owing to the coal stoppage and possibly interruption of deliveries here, foreign competitors were making great play abroad by saying - &quot;if you place your orders in England you will get interruptions&quot;. It was not, however, a very serious matter.COTTON.COLONEL SSDDON BROWN wrote&quot;In addition to the two strikes there have of course been the Whitsuntide holidays which have been very generally extended this year in Lancashire.&quot;As regards the American section of the spinning trade mills are still working short-time and the latest figures shew that even in spite of the short-time the sales of yarn are considerably below the actual production^ and further, the sales of yarn are very little in excess of 50fi of normal production. In the Egyptian spinning section there is still no organised short-time.    The mills are working as near full-time as they can. obtain fuel.    Unfortunately however, margins of profit are certainly going worse in the Eg3rptian section.    In the cloth trade there are now an enormous number of mills idle and this section of the industry can only be described as bad.
COTTON  (Contd.).&quot;I am afraid my report is very pessimistic.    The only optimistic thing I can see is that I think since the Whitsuntide holidays there has been a considerably improved enquiry for both yarn and cloth,  and a feeling appears to be developing that as soon as the Coal Strike is over there may be a prospect of at least some little improvement in the Cotton Trade.    This, however,  is only a matter of conjecture and we shall have to wait to find out whether it materialises or not&quot; .SIR W.  CLARE LEES wrote:-&quot;Trade in Manchester is only of small dimensions. All Contracts necessarily contain a Strike Clause, which introduces an element of doubt,  and this is a great deterrent to frosh business.    i&apos;he recent general strike has not had any very great effect on the execution of contracts due for delivery in May,  as the Cotton Trade as a whole was able to continue production and to make deliveries in sufficient volume to meet most of the current liabilities.&quot;The clearance of stocks in China continues,  and prices when related to replacement values are not bad.    The appearance in the China market generally is that it is improving and that with a little more confidence in cotton values more trade will be done.    In India stocks are not heavy and in spite of the fact that all goods that are arriving are dear in comparison to to-day&apos;s values, there is no general accumulation taking place in any of the markets.    The prospect of the Monsoon is over-shadowing fresh buying,  and until rains are assured in sufficient quantities it would appear that the Indian markets ?/ill pursue a more or less  &apos;hand to mouth&apos; policy. The improvement in the Japanese Exchange should relieve the pressure of Japanese competition to some extent; on the other hand,  the recent fall in the Italian exchange will tend to intensify Italian competition where it exists, particularly in the Near East and Mediterranean Markets&quot;.WOOL.COLONEL WILLEY was afraid that as far as the Wool Textile Trade was concerned, he could not avoid presenting a rather discouraging picture.    There was a complete cessation of new business in the home trade, because up and down the country distributors were finding that money was not spent so freely,  and purchases were being delayed,.  - and past experience had shown that where seasonal purchases were delayed they could generally be made more cheaply later on.    This postponement might even mean that orders were lost for ever.    We were also feeling the loss of the export of semi-manufactured materials to the Continent,  because of the bad trade in Germany and elsewhere.       The competition of French goods was very acute,  and some British traders went so far as to say that,
OOHFlPgHTLAL. WGOL. Coootd,)in the absence of any disposition on the part of the French Government to lay upon their manufacturers a financial burden such as ours&apos; had been bearing, some compensation should be accorded by the British Government to their manufacturers - to put it bluntly, a prohibition of imports from France until her manufacturers bore the burdens whloh this country was imposing on hers1 whilst they were endeavouring to compete with French goods in foreign markets,A point to which Col. V/illey drew attention once before was the manifest shrinkage of the world consumption of wool textiles in relation to total expenditure.     This was best exemplified by the depressed state of the textile industry during the last eighteen months in the United States - the most prosperous country in the world.    This shrinkage of consumption, so far as the British textile trades were concerned, had a distinct bearing on the coal situation he^e, with its possibility of a further subsidy and compulsory re-organisation under the supervision of the Government.     For it might be argued that if a compulsory reconstitution of the coal industry was required in view of the inefficiency with which it had been managed, did not the depressed condition of the textile trades point to a similar inefficiency there, and an equal need of re-organisation at the instance of the Government? That was one phase of the difficulties which confronted the textile industries in particular;   the other related to the search in men&apos;s minds for a method of adopting the American principle of payment by results.     This principle seemed in the first instance to be applicable to trades like the Iron and steel trade, shipbuilding, and engineering.     For the textile trade, the exports of which were equal in value to those of the other industries referred to, put together, was largely dependent upon the progress being made in such trades in regard to a reduction of costs, following payment by results, and could not itself put a reduction of costs into effect in that way until some progress had been made&apos; in these other trades.    They in turn would have to look for a lead to the Coal trade.    That was another reason why the textile trade was suffering more acutely, probably, than other trades from the granting of a subsidy to the coal industry, and emphasized the Importance of a coal settlement not inconsistent with ecohomic prosperity in other departments of the country1 s commerce .MR. ANDREWS desired to emphasize what had been said about the export trade in the Wool Textile Industry.     The cost of production was so very high in this country that it was quite Impossible for British manufacturers to compete- with foreigners1 prices in the world&apos;s markets.
ARTIFICIAL    SILK.MR. ADD IS ON wrote:-&quot;The General Strike has, of course, been the predominant factor during the past month, and this must be borne in mind when reviewing Trade under the period in question.&quot;In the Leek and Macclesfield Area,  Fabric Knitting is on the slow side,   and it Is generally agreed by the Makers there that this Is largely due to Change of Fashion.    It would appear that the chief problem confronting Manufacturers in these districts is whether the Fashion will change again or whether their Machines can produce a type of fabric which happens to be in demand at the present time.&quot;Weaying Trade - The position is similar to that mentioned-in the&apos; last Report, but with a tendency towards improvement.&quot;Export - The Strike caused a general hold-up of dispatches,  and customers abroad havo been compelled to substitute various makes of Yarn in order to keep their machinery running.    The Continental Spinners who are carrying large stocks have not been slow to avail themselves of this opportunity and are willing to accept very low prices in order to  secure business.&quot;CHEMICALS.MR. PERRY said that the main feature of importance in the chemical Industry that he wanted to report was the situation of the industry both during the General Strike and   following it. The chemical industry employed about a quarter of a million men and-it was said that probably less than 5,000 came out on strike.    In the&quot; majority of the sections the manufacturing operations were carried on normally.    In certain works production fell to as low as 50 to 80 per cent.    The tar distillers section suffered most heavily, but on the whole there had teen no serious falling off of the production of chemicals.    The stocks of chemical products were consistently good throughout the country and there would probably not be any shortage of available supplies for several weeks, provided of course that transport was available.POTTERY.MR. HOLLINS said that had it not been for the coal stoppage the . Pottery trade would have been looking forward to rather a good year.    The set-back would probably not be very serious if they could get an early resumption of unimpeded work, but it was very difficult to report anything definite with regard to the whole position.
RUBBER.MR. JOHNSTON wrote:-&quot;The Rubber Industry generally speaking was able to continue running to almost full capacity during the General Strike, but has naturally experienced a quietness in demand since.    Weather conditions have not been favourable and have affected Tyres, Garden Hose, Summer Footwear and other Season-able articles.&quot;Very serious increases in foreign Imports have also affected Tyre Sales, and the-uncertainty of the situation has naturally reacted on Car Sales and Tyre Equipments therefor&quot;.Co-operative Vfholesale Society.SIR THOMAS ALLEN said that the Co-operative Wholesale Society&apos;s figures up to and including the 2nd May for essential food commodities showed a better position than at any time since 1921.   Compared with the preceding quarter they Indicated an increased trade of 22 per cent., and as compared with the corresponding period of last year an increase of 15 per cent. The general wholesale and retail business had, of course,  since been considerably upset.    The power of purchasing food had materially decreased, and trades such as furnishing were practically at a standstill;    further, in the case of drapery and allied trades the trouble arose at what is normally consider-ed. the busy season.Sir Thomas desired to pay a tribute to the Board of Trade for its action in relation to the wholesale and distributive trade during the crisis.    The Government&apos;s request that quota-tions should rule on pre-strike terms had been respected.    The wholesale and retail trade, under what one might call the vigorous but effective restraint of the Board of Trade, had behaved splendidly,  and the action of the Board of Trade through its officers had done much to assist in the good content of the community.    The President expressed appreciation of what Sir Thomas Allen had said.    The Board of Trade, however, could not have done what they did unless they had been met more than half way by the trade.    The arrangement they had had with the principal big wholesale industries on what should be done, was honoured in the letter and the spirit throughout, and this showed a loyalty and responsibility in all those trades, and an appreciation of what the real interest of the country was, that was quite admirable.-a-
CONFIDENTIAL.GENERAL TRADE .SIR MAX MUSPRATT desired to refer to the General Strike and to confirm Sir Arthur Balfour&apos;s statement (see Section on Special Steel).    The strike had produced a new psychology among the workers.    In a great number of the industries the men either refused to come out or came out most reluctantly, and the whole   collapse of the general strike had produced a condition of affairs which, he thought, if wisely handled in the next two months would attain a great many of the results that were desired, - a better realisation of the economics of industry and of the part that the worker could take in making it a success in which he was going to participate, or a loss from which, he would necessarily suffer.MR. VYLE considered that if the Coal Stoppage had been settled at the same time as the General Strike, the effects would by now have passed away, but the Stoppage was still with us and was becoming increasingly serious every day it went on.    There were complaints of difficulties in connection with the restriction of coal.    The restriction was supposed to be on a basis of b0%, but it was not administered with equal load on everybody.    In the same area of control one could find, say, that the Gas Company were insistent upon a reduction of 50%, but that the Electricity Company were not so insistent.As regards our trade abroad, Mr. Vyle endorsed what Mr. Lindsay said with regard to India (see section on Indian Trade), aild especially as to . India buying equipment of a much higher character than she had ever had before;    she was, in fact, eager to scrap existing appliances for better ones. The export trade with Prance, Belgium and Italy was very difficult to carry on.    In Prance and in Belgium It was a question of their currency.   As to Italy, if one was trying to export to that country something they could make there, they used their cheaper labour to produce it at a price with which we could not compete.MR. MACHIN desired to confirm the view of Sir Arthur Balfour that in the long run the General Strike would not have a very prejudicial effect.   Workpeople were returning to work with anxiety to settle down and work in co-operation, and we might :.now  have a settled state in connection with industry such as we nad not known for many years past.As far as general trade was concerned in the home market, it was being maintained, and was likely to be maintained, if not increased.    In connection with export, Mr. Vyle had said that the Continent was very unsatisfactory.   France and Belgium had, in fact, become impossible.    In Germany there was plenty of business to be done if one was prepared to take a risk, but the lack of money there was such that it was hardly worth taking the business offered.    In connection with the Overseas trade, Mr. Machin thought the outlook distinctly promising.    In the food branches, with which he was specially connected, they had had in the last few months orders and enquiries from Colonies which had been dormantfor years.    In Lgypt and elsewhere there were signs of revival such as had not been seen for a long time;    and optimistic reports had been received as regards Canada.    In the West of the Dominion in particular there was a cheerful feeling, and buyers were placing orders in quantities and with confidence, which had not been the case since the war.
GENERAL TRADE (Contd.).SIR JAMES LITHGOW wrote:-&quot;The position in Shipbuilding and in the other heavy trades, quite apart from the  strike, is still very depressed, the hopetfu.1 signs which some people discerned in the winter not having materialised so far as these trades are concerned.&quot;My view is, therefore, merely confirmed that until- this country makes up its mind to cut its costs down to a level more nearly approaching that of its competitors, no progress can possibly be looked for towards expanding our foreign trade.&quot;However unpopular and unpalatable the view may be, I am again driven to say that there is no justification, either historical or otherwise, for a country in the situation of our own to expect to be able to afford to its people a higher standard of remuneration than we did pre-war..  On the contrary, in the enervating atmosphere of &quot;money for nothing&quot; provided by the numerous social services, which are all good in their own way, and while our operatives and producing plant are work-ing shorter hours, it seems to me that a lower rather than a higher standard of living must be the inevitable outcome.    Suoh a tendency can only be counteracted by a complete revolution of the outlook of the ordinary working man in the direction of more intense effort.   My own observations lead me to believe that there is no popular desire for this, the shorter hours and many other costly reforms being the ?/ork of doctrinaires and agitators rather than arising from a spontaneous desire on the part of those who are supposed to benefit.&quot;There seems to be a widespread feeling that confidence will be re-established and trade improved as a result of the fiasco of the general strike.    I submit that this result can come about only if those concerned realise that the general strike was the inevitable outcome of the tendency, manifest now for many years, to regard Trades Union combination as an opportunity for political pressure and propaganda, rather than as a means of improving the lot of the worker along economic lines.    The experience cf the recent past will be lost In the same way as the lessons in adaptability and power of production of our people during the war have been largely lost, unless those in authority take steps not only to prevent the prostitu-tion of industrial organisation to political purposes, but also waken themselves and enlighten the nation as to the damage done by our industrial organisations in sterilising adaptability and expansion in the interests of selfish coteries pursuing economic heresies under the cloak of protecting their members from exploitation.&quot;Appeals to co-operation and goodwill are valueless so long as it Is in the power of any section, whether they may be a majority or a minority, to dictate the conditions of work not only for themselves but for all others taking part in a particular trade or business, and I trust that recent events may move those in authority to take seme steps to reduce the powers of combination in our industrial life.    In my view it is futile to expect that, left to themselves, those In authority In industrial combinations will spontaneously alter their outlooko&quot;
GENERAL TRADE (Contd. ) .MR. BRAND thought that in Germany the position was much the same as In this country, inasmuch as the financial position was gpod and the Industrial position bad.   Money was -very cheap.    The private Discount rate was about 4%, a little higher than In this country.    They had started making German issues inside Germany again.   During the last year about  50,000,000 of internal issues had been placed in Germany, which a year ago would have been considered absolutely impossible. There was a lot of easy money, partly through investments from abroad and partly through the tremendous depression in Industry as a whole.    There were something like 1,800,000 to 2,000,000 unemployed in Germany, and the view there appeared to be that the most important fact in the situation was the franc, because their Industry was upset, just as ours was, by the fluctuations in the franc and the depreciation both in France and Belgium. Mr. Brand gathered that the Germans thought their Industry, while it was very depressed, was prepared now to take advantage of any Improvement in general conditions.    They had carried through great re-organisationsj, it was said, for instance, in connection with the new Steel Trust, that they were scrapping very large parts of the biggest concerns in German Luxembourg, and were going to concentrate in the Thyssen works which were very favourably situated on the Rhine.    They were thus taking very strong measures to put themselves in a position to compete.The internal value of the franc in France, certainly in all country districts, was a long way above the external value, and, therefore, if they stabilised at anything like 150 they would have a very big margin of safetvjj    The position In Belgium was more or less the same as In France,    In the United States &apos;Vall&quot; money was a little higher than it had been.    There were some recent indications that perhaps things were now not quite so prosperous in that country.   The Ford Car Works were said now to be running only three days a week, and a Dutch Banker had told Mr. Brand that there were signs in the Diamond Industry in Amsterdam ,.that the Americans were not buying as many diamonds as they had been.   An American had reported an interesting occurrence In his firm which employed 40,000 workmen.    They had introduced a plan for the workmen to invest in the preference shares of the company, and had oreated preference shares to the value of 15,000,600 dollars, of which they had expected that in the first year perhaps 5,000,000 dollars worth would be subscribed.    In two months, however, 14,000,000 dollars were subscribed by their own workmen, and they had now got 25,000 of their employees as shareholders In their company.    The only iriducement the workmen were getting was a small percentage, -perhaps 1 per cent., - of their wages In the year towards the purchase of the shares.    The shares could, Mr. Brand thought, not be sold, except back to the company in some way.
GENERAL TRADE AND BANKING.MR. TENNANT handed in the Reports from the Branches of the westminster Bank.     There was no particular feature about them except that the coal situation seemed to have practically dominated the position.      In the cotton trade the outlook was said to be somewhat better;    and boots and shoes appeared also to be better.   With regard to the financial position, the great feature had been the extra-oi^dinary steadiness of the markets during ,this period of Strike.    In the short money market, when the General Strike was on, there was a rise in the Bill rate to about 4^8, but that had gradually steadied down to 4-J, which was abGUt what it had been before.     The Bank of England had been accumulat-ing gold during this period, and they now had just under  7,000,000 less than at the introduction of the gold standard.      In the Foreign Exchange market there had been extraordinary fluctuations in the franc.      It had been up as high as 180 and down to about 148.      The Belgian franc was In much the same case and the Italian lira had also had extraordinary fluctuations.   There had only been two Issues of any importance this month, the Dunlop Rubber Cotton Mills 6-g per cent. Preference Shares, which were over-subscribed, and the New Zealand Government 6,000,000 5 pe r cent, stock at 98-g which was very largely over-subs cribed.BANKING,MR. CURRIE remarked that one of the things which had been noticed in the discount market was the decrease in commercial bills, as indicated by the fact that the rate for these bills was now under the Treasury rate.     He thought it was very satisfactory that the Stock Exchange business had kept up during the strike and did not show any particular sign of falling off now.      The position in the banks for the first part of  the year had been that deposits had rather decreased and loans had increased.      That would now probably change.SHIPPING.SIR ALAN ANDERSON sent in the following figures :-INDEX NUMBER OF FREIGHTS.1920 a 100 1913  - 100April 1926   ............      22.62    ...... 96.67March 1926  ............&apos;    21.86    ...... 93.42April 1925........____      25.26    ...... 107.9LAID UP TONNAGE.

SIR H. WALKER stated that the figures available for April showed a very considerable improvement in the general trade of the country;    and undoubtedly, in nearly all diroctions, the general merchandise traffic was extraordinarily,   heavy now. Whether it was partly due to traffic held up as a result of the strike one could not tell, but the general merchandise traffic to-day was very considerable.   All the railwaymen in that section were working on full time.SHIPPING (Co-ntd.). TONNAGE UNDER CONSTRUCTION.&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;    ---     - gross tons.March 31st, 1926 ...

RAILWAY TRAFFIC  (Contd.).MR. HURCOMB gave the following figures as bearing out what bir Herbert Walker had said.   For the first sixteen weeks of the year, that Is, up to the 21st April, the increase in gross receipts was nearly one million, of which about a quarter of a million was passenger traffic and three-quarter million goods traffic.   That of course had now been turned into a heavy deficiency on gross receipts through the cessation of all sorts of traffic during the General Strike,   The tonnage in March showed an increase of 443,000 tons of general merchandise over March of last year, 1,116,000 tons of coal, coke and patent fuel, and 427,000 tons of other minerals.   All were substantial increases over March of last year and that tendency went on through April.    The position was showing very marked signs of improvement before the stoppage.EMPLOYMBNT.MR. PHILLIPS observed that the unemployment total at the end of April was below the million.   The precise figure for 26th April was 981,877.   Immediately after the mining stoppage there was an increase to 1,106,000 on Monday, May 3rd.   This was followed by a much larger increase owing to the General Strike, and the figure for the 24th May was 1,597,700.    This was a reduction of about 15,000 as compared with the previous week, 17th May, owing probably to the cases of resumption of work after the General Strike being slightly more numerous on balance than the additional stoppages consequent on the mining dispute.   On 24th May, there was a large reduction in unemploy-ment in the bouth of England and iri Scotland and a large increase-in the North of England.    The figures given excluded as far as possible miners who stopped work owing to the dispute and strikers in- other industries;The Ministry of Labour were trying to collect figures as to the aggregate numbers who came out In the General Strike. As far as they could tell at present, there were anything between two and three million of these at the height of the stoppage, in addition to   the one and a half million out of work involuntarily.EFFECTS OF COAL STOPPAGE. IRON AND STEEL.MR. DORMAN wrote -&quot;Most blast furnaces have been either damped down or blown out, although some firms have found it possible to operate one or two furnaces on slack blast. ,Steel Plants and Rolling Mills are universally- out of commission.
EFFECTS OF COAL STOPPAGE-IRON AND STEEL  (Oontd.).- &quot;Most Constructional Engineering firms are able to carry on for a short period on part time, but their operations are naturally dependent on the receipt of supplies of plain material.    There are very few definite enquiries for immediate business in this branch of the industry.&quot;The Wire Trade is practically at a standstill, there being no enquiries for home deliveries owing to the stoppage in the ooal mines,  and Continental manufacturers, particularly the Germans,  are obtaining all the export orders, which are being placed at prices much below those which British Manufacturers can quote.    There are a few Wire Mills operating in the country on part time.&quot;Some of the Galvanised and Blaok Sheet Works in the country are working on short time, but this will only be possible for a further period of 2/3 weeks&quot;.ME. BAKER wrote&quot;There Is little to report in connection with the iron and stoel trades that is of much service under the circumstances of the short supply of coal&quot;.STEEL.SIR ARTHUR BALFOUR observed that fortunately a great number of firms in Sheffield had gone in for Electric power and were using from the big power stations which were fairly well supplied with coal.    That had kept up the output of the lighter industries of Sheffield very satisfactorily.    The heavy steel industry, of course, was beginning to close down but an extraordinary amount of steel and steel goods had been produced in Sheffield in the last four weeks in spite of the stoppage and was being shipped.    The closing down was not very serious yet.    Perhaps another fortnight would affect a good many firms but, in Sir A. Balfour&apos;s own case, ho could manage quite well for another three weeks in all his works.NON-FERROUS METALS.SIR CECIL BUDD remarked that, with the exception of tin-plates and galvanised iron,  the base metal works were going considerably in excess of 50C/S.    That, he thought, was largely due to the fact that when the last Coal Strike occurred a great many works put in apparatus for using oil, which was very suitable for many of tho processes.    That had helped them very much, and v/ould enable them to continue, provided transport was available, for some time to come - for more than three weeks.
in Sir PHILIP NASH considered that in about a fortnight^ time the effect of the coal stoppage would be felt, for two reasons: one was that there would be difficulty in getting outside supplies of material,  and secondly, it was almost impossible to get rid of the finished products of big plant.   Buyers could not take delivery,  and there was difficulty about moving those heavy pieces.   So in about a fortnight or three weeks&apos; time the industry would gradually begin to have to turn off men and close down by departments.   He had not heard of anybody closing down at all up to date, neither in the manufacturing plant nor in cables, but it was bound to start In a fortnight or three weeks.COTTON.COLONEL SEDDON BROWN wrote:-nSince the Advisory Council last met trade has been worse than ever.    It is difficult, however,  to be able to estimate how much of the increased depression in trade is duo to ordinary causes and how much must be attributed to the General Strike which took place and tho Coal Stoppage which is at present on. At the moment buyers appear to havo absolutely no confidence at all.    Strike clauses have to be insisted upon in all contracts and it is very difficult for anybody to negotiate business&quot;.WOOL.COLONEL WILLEY said there was no doubt that the proapnt position was one virtually of complete stagnation; new orders had completely ceased and the actual position of employment was bad because it was a case of short time, which had more of an immediate effect than complete unemployment.    Although some factories would be shut down entirely, the majority would be working short time, with the two-fold result of reducing the earnings capable of distribution and raising the operating cost, and consequently making still more difficult the case of competition,    as regards the actual effect of the strike, there was plenty of coal in the Wool Textile Trade as a whole.    There was no fear of a lack of coal; it was lack of orders that was the chief difficulty,MR. ANDREWS observed that tho Wool Textile trade was not so much troubled with the position with regard to coal as they were about cancellation of orders.    The cancellations had been so heavy.    The 50$ allowance of coal was more than sufficient to produce a good supply.EFFECTS OF COAL STOPPAGE* ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING.
tuEFFECTS OF COAL STOPPAGE.ARTIFICIAL SILK.MR.  addison WROTE: -&quot;Generally speaking,  the Home Trade has been remarkably good,  and customers have shown great willingness to accept all deliveries of Yarn.    It is, however,  doubtful whether business can be maintained at this level, as the Authorities are in all districts tightening up restrictions on the consumption of coal, Apart from this,  the future- outlook is distinctly hopeful,  and it is felt that,  if the Coal Stoppage could be terminated there would be a heavy demand for Artificial Silk from the Hosiery section&quot;.CHEMICALS.MR. PERRY remarked that so far he could not say that the shortage of coal had seriously interfered with chemical manufacturers, but every day now the difficulties were increasing, and increasing more and more rapidly. He thought that within three weeks from now, and perhaps even less, the entire industry would be brought to a standstill if fresh supplies of coal were not available.RUBBER.MR. JOHNSTON wrote:-&quot;Until the Coal question is settled and matters resume the normal,  it is unlikely that the distinctly favourable conditions in this industry obtaining a few months ago will return11 .POTTERY.MR. HOLLINS said that from all reports,  the pottery makers were not closing down quite so quickly as in 1921; nevertheless each week large numbers of factories were shutting up on account of the shortage of coal, and which was important raw material for them.Mr, Hollins thought that perhaps one-third of our factories were closed.: A few factories took their work-people back last week, but only for two or three days.    The workers were out again this week in unemployment and each day it was becoming more serious with the trade.    He believed that some factories may carry on for another five or six weeks but perhaps in the next fortnight or so the majority of firms would be closing down.
,CONFIDENTIAL. EFFECTS OF,COAL STOPPAGE.SHIPPING. SIB ALAN ANDERSON wrote:-&quot;The tonnage, laid up on the let April, 1926, was nearly 12% lower than on the 1st January and Qf0 better than twelve months earlier.    There has, however, been an increase in unemployed tonnage as the result of the strike and many ships are held up in this country under the Emergency Regulations.    The tonnage laid up in the South Wales ports on the 3st April, 1926, was 15,214 net tons;  on the 29th May the total was 166,750 net tons.&apos;&apos;GENERAL TRADE-?SIR MAX MUSPPATT stated that the large coal consuming industries had been running at a little over fifty per cent, of their normal capacity ever since the beginning of May,  and most of them could run on, ho thought- for two to three woeks longer at about that figure.    But after that it mount almost complete closing down,  in at any rate industries that consumed large&apos; quantities of coal.As far as the export business was concerned, the fifty per cent, allowance of coal, plus accumulated stocks, had enabled the country as a whole to execute almost every order that was on its books.    Of course,  the exception is the very heavy trades: but on the whole Sir Max Muspratt did not think this country had lost an appreciable amount on day to day or week to week business or gone short upon any of its contracts for ordinary supplies. That had been possible owing to the fact that manufacturers had been preparing for the emergency by laying up fairly-   large stocks; in many cases carrying them in various parts of the worll.    At any rate, in the chemical industry he did not think a si.igle order had been lost;  that was highly gratifying and, needless to say, they wanted to maintain that position if they possibly could.    In regard to the industries in which electricity was used and obtained from the big power stations,  the position up to the present had been extremely good.MR. MACHIN believed that in London many, like himself, could go on for three or possibly four weeks eking out supplies without substantial additions to their costs, but if the coal stoppage lasted say beyond a month longer, unless they were able to get additional supplies of ooal, it would cause considerable trouble and lead to cutting down their work and the discharge of their workpeople.RAILWAYS.SIR HERBERT WALKER stated that there was no reason why railways should not be able to carry on,  so far as coal was concerned, for another eight or ten weeks at least.   Of course they had cut down the services very considerably,  and each week as we progressed towards the holiday season the public would suffer more inconvenience, which unfortunately the railways could not remedy, but they did not anticipate having to cut their services more than they had done up to the present,  either for goods or passengers.
ELECTRICITY SUPPLY BILL.SIR PHILIP NASH stated that the  heavy Electrical Engineer-ing business,  as regards the Home Market,  continued to be very depressed.    This side of the business had been depressed now for about seven or eight months, owing to the uncertainty of power   undertaking in regard to the Electricity Supply Bill, now in Committee stage in the house.    But Sir Philip thought that the discussions that had taken place in the House had cleared the air to a certain extent,  and that those under-takings, both municipal and otherwise, who had Power Stations which would obviously become selected Stations under the terms of the Bill were inclined to go ahead, as they had to think of their position to meet the load in the winter of 1928j  and obviously many of them unless they moved now, would not be in a position to meet that load.    As regards the majority of the Power Undertakings, which were of a smaller size, further business was held up because their position under this Bill was still very uncertain.    The Bill was also most important to the Electrical Industry.    The Heavy Electrical Engineering Industry were large buyers outside their own trade.It was most important that this Bill should become an Act before the end of this Session or by the end of this Session. The interests concerned were beginning to get a little nervous as to whether it would not be deferred, but even when the Bill was through Parliament some time must elapse before the new Authority would be set up.    The new Authority had,  as it were, to settle in and get a staff together before it could function, and its first task was to produce a general scheme for the electricity supply of the country.    It was obvious, therefore, that some months must elapse even after the passing of the Bill before Home Trade could be released.    At the present time the normal growth of electricity undertakings in the country was arrested, and it was therefore of very great importance not merely to the manufacturers,  but to the whole of the country,  that this Bill should not be allowed to stand over.    At the present moment the Electricity Commissioners were unable to release a lot of business.    Their permission must be obtained under the present regulations to any extension of a power house,  and there was much work which they were bound to hold up until this Bill was through.AUSTRALIAN TRADE.MR.  SANDERSON reported that cereals were growing well all over Australia,  with the exception of Northern Queensland.    There had been considerable losses on stocks, but from now onwards the position would probably be favourable,  and wheat had particularly benefited.    It was too early yet to say what the orop was likely to be, but its prospects were very good.    The present- indications were that at the meat works of Queensland the bulk of the slaughtering would cease at the end of June and the season close in the middle of July.    In South-West Queensland there might be a supply of cattle next September to warrant the re-opening of the works then, but the condition of the beef market in the United Kingdom at present was rather against a profitable export.    Another item of interest was that a
AUSTRALIAN TRADE (OOntd.).representative from London was stated in the Press to have arrived in Australia for the establishment of a British-Australian Film Company with a capital of 1-g- millions.    It was understood to be suggested that such a Company should be established in Victoria, where the climate was a suitable one.The President observed that figures had been published, in a recent issue of the Board of Trade Journal, of the respective proportions of our trade with Empire countries and foreign countries.    These particulars had been brought down to the year ended 31st March last, and they were extraordinarily interesting as to the imports into the United Kingdomi    In 1913 we got from Empire Countries 24.87$ of our total imports; whilst in the year ending March, 1925, that percentage had arisen to 27.19, and in the year ended March 1926 it had risen to 30.63.    That was a remarkable figure; and the Journal article should bo attached to the Minutes of the present meeting.    (See print at the end of these Notes).INDIAN TRADE.MS. LINDSAY said that the Cotton Piece Goods Trade in Calcutta was recovering after the disturbances,  and there was every prospect of improving trade to Calcutta.    The Machinery trade to India   had not yet recovered, and that was due chiefly to the reduced demand in India for textile machinery.    There waB a self-denying ordinance in the Calcutta jute mills to the effeot that they would not extend their plant, owing to the short time that was being worked at present.    There was, consequently, no demand for jute machinery, and the depression in the Bombay cotton mills had also reduced the demand for machinery there.Much was being done in the way of agricultural improvements in India, and this was the time to study very carefully the demands for foreign goods in India because without doubt India&apos;s purchasing power was increasing, particularly in the direction of finer goods, the substitution of artificial silk goods for cotton goods, of white for grey, of coloured for white; and there were many other instances of the same sort.    About one million acres of land, formerly   entirely desert, was being brought,  each yoar, under cultivation in India, and that must mean a relief to over-population, the extension of holdings, larger individual holdings, and therefore higher purchasing power.    In regard to the cultivation of cotton, five years ago roughly one million acres were under improved cottons.   Last year the acreage was three millions; so it had multiplied by three in the last five years, and that was only one instance of a number of measures which were being taken in India to improve the crop.    The position I in regard to jute had swung over in the last month or two from a known and serious shortage to an anticipated surplus.   Under present conditions the estimate, if the present weather continued   1 favourable, w%s of a crop in the neighbourhood of ten million bales as against eight million last year and five millions five years ago, - a very great increase, in fact a return to the conditions before the War.
iC 3 trade IN SOUTH AMERICA.MR. HOSE stated that in the Argentine, taking the whole of the cereals together,  the shipments were fully equal to those of last year.    The country had borrowed and was continuing to borrow very largely from the United States, who were very ready lenders to the South American States at present.    The United States had recently made a loan to Uruguay of no less than  10 per head of the population,  in addition to the already existing debt.    That seemed to be loading the debt in a remarkable fashion; - the loan was Sfo, it was placed in New York, and was very much over-subscribed.    The import trade in the Argentine was bad.    They had had a great many failures generally and particularly amongst the textile houses there.In Brazil there was to be an attempt to stabilise the exchange, but attempts to stabilise were not always successful. Mr. Hose thought it would be in the case of Brazil, hut we had the failure in Belgium continually before our eyes.    With regard to the question of stabilisation, representations had been made about the impossibility of our own country competing with manufacturers in countries where they had these greatly depreciated currencies; but no cure had been suggested,  and one failed to see a cure except a national one,   that if your currency depreciated to suoh an extent that it disappeared like that of Germany,  then you came into your own again.In Chile the stabilisation had been effective, and things were proceeding satisfactorily except as to salee of nitrate. There had been talk about the unsatisfactory condition of that trade, but it was doubtful whether there was any need for great anxiety.    Synthetic nitrate was being sold at a price which competed with natural nitrate, but the latter contained elements which constituted it superior to the synthetic.    There had, moreover, been a reduction of an economic character in the price of natural nitrate - of 10/- a tori, - which would enable   it to be sold on equal terms with synthetic; it&quot;could always do so at a price which was somewhat higher than that for synthetic.There was a further point to be noted in regard to the General Strike in this country.    There were very considerable withdrawals of money from here to the United States immediately the General Strike was declared.    All the countries in South America who had funds here withdrew very largely from our Banks. It was to be expected; but money onoe taken out of the country would probably remain out of the country for a long time.FAR EASTERN TRADE.MR. LANBALE reported that British shipping on the China Coast was still much hampered by the position in the South, which closed both Canton and Swatow to British ships;  and steps had recently been taken by the local officials in Swatow to reclaim land in front of British property and demand an exorbitant price for the new land.    This interfered with the wharf accommodation and would make the handling of cargo very difficult when the Port was reopened to British steamers.    In the South, the delivery of goods had improved and it was now possible to contract for delivery in Canton at 25% of the cost of the goods, which included freight, duty and such payments as were necessary to the strikers.    In the North, business was still interfered
CONFIDENTIAL. FAR EASTERN TRADE (Oontd.).with by the state of the Railways.    There was more demand for exports from China, and a fair business in Oil Seeds had been done, which pointed to improved conditions on the Continent. Silk business had not been so good owing to lack of demand from America.For more than two years the Railways of China had been used by militarists as their private property.    Funds were sequestered, so that the Ministry of Communications, which used to be the richest of all Ministries, had degenerated into a shadow organisation without any control over the Railways for which it was responsible.    Some cf the lines in Northern China had been brought to such a pitch of ruination that they were unable to continue efficient operation without complete reorganisation and replacement of rolling stock.    It was not surprising therefore that defaults on the services of Chinese Railway Loans were increasing as each half-yearly period for payment became due.    As soon as a strong Government in Poking was established, which would take in hand the proper protection and reorganisation of the Railways, there should be a considerable field for activity in supplying the necessary funds and material for development in this branch of ChinaTs public works. Mr. Landale thought it unlikely that the Chinese would be able to compose their differences without some Foreign assistance.

The value of the exports of imported goods to the Irish Free State was, however, nearly as great as a year earlier. .For purposes of better comparison with 1913, we have excluded our trade with the Irish Free State from the tables which follow. A further correction should be made in respect of the direct trade of the ports of Southern Ireland with overseas countries, since that is included in the figures for 1913. The export trade was however negligible and the imports only formed about 1 per cent, of the total imports into the United Kingdom.

As regards re-exports the most note-worthy point is the increase in the proportion consigned to North America.The following tables show the distribution of our import, export and re-export trade with the principal countries concerned, trade with the Irish Free State being omitted :  I.

Confident ial,Statement made at the meeting of the Advisory-Committee to the Department of Overseas Trade held on Wednesday,  26th May,  1926, regarding the export trade position.MR. ROWLAND  (Agricultural and General Engineers  Ltd.),  wrote:-&quot;(1) Apart from the restriction on the consumption of coal and power, the general strike had very little effect upon the group of which I am Chairman,  or so far as  I can ascertain upon our chief competitors.    Comparatively few men ceased work,  and the loss in production may be taken as representing an ordinary Bank Holiday stoppage,&quot;(2) The continuance of the coal strike cannot fail to have a very serious effect upon the engineering trade as a whole.    The full position of the trade prior to these stoppages has been so fully set out in the -age negotiations that it is hardly necessary to draw attention to the crippling effect that these stoppages, with their accompanying and additional burdens,  must entail upon an already much harassed trade.The following are extracts from letters received fromother members who v^ere unable to attend tbe meeting:MR, T.B.  JOHNSTON:   (Pottery):&quot;At the last meeting at which I was present   I pointed out that our export trade in pottery had been severely hit by the return to the J^old standard-.    Up to June 1925 we had been going on fafrly well, but  in July there came a sudden change:  our export orders fell off,  and as a consequence we had to reduce our prices for semi-porcelain  (the bulk line ) by 10 per cent.      But even with this reduction orders were not satisfactory.&quot;I have now had a return from our Export Association for the year ending July 31st 1925,  showing the total sales  980,977.    For the five months  ending 31st December 1925 the total sales  amounted to  326,329,  a falling off of approxi-mately 20 p.c.     So that notwithstanding the reduction in pri,re of 10 .per cent.,  which eliminated  all profits, we have not maintained our position.&quot;JjR^STANLEY POD WELL:   (China merchant trade);!!k&apos;ith regard to trade in. China,  I am afraid I cannot paint a rosy picture either in respect of the  present or the future, but it is certainly better than it ?as three months  ago.     In Shanghai and the North the boycott may be said to have collapsed. The Chinese are keen to do business with us again, but trade is sadly hampered by the military operations going on in certain parts of the country, by the uncertainty- 0f the future,  and by the  absolute chaos existing on nearly all the railways.    There is general nervousness that Wu Pei Pu and  Chang-Tso-Lin may fall out when they have succeeded in their joint operations against the Kuominchum armies,   Chang-Tso-Lin having already refused to recognise the  &quot;Shadow&quot; Government nominated by &quot;;u Pel Pu.
confidential.-2-&quot;In Canton and the South the boycott &apos; against Hong Kong continues unabated.    It could be ended by a substantial payment by the Hong Kong Government to the funds of the strike committee,  a course which it would be folly to adopt. In spite of the somewhat optimistic report in the  &quot;Times:! to the effect that the Moderate Party under Chang Kai Shek, as opposed to the Bolshevik element, had now gained the upperhand, I personally fear it may be some time before normal relations are restored.    I sincerely trust I may be wrong, As far as our own trade is concerned the boycott has not meant absolute stagnation.    Our deliveries of piece goods, for instance, have been fairly good, but all the  &quot;chops&quot; are removed,  as no doubt is the case with the goods of other British merchants, and this must have a serious effect if the present situation lasts much longer.&quot;As you are no doubt aware, the China Committee, under the chairmanship of Lord Southborough, of which I am a member, is in close touch with the Government on all matters  affecting China.&quot;MR.  F. HOIRQYD.   (Cotton Spinning):       In the cotton trade there was   very slight demand for cloth or yarn, though there had been a few enquiries from China in the last few weeks.    As regards the strike, the effects had not been very serious so far.    None of the mills had been closed, and on the whole there was enough coal for another month both on the spinning and the weaving side.MR.THOMPSON:   (Manchester shipping merchant):  Mr.  Thompson stated that as regards cotton piece goods there had been no revival.    It was worthy of remark that the reduction in the price of rap- material and consequently of the finished goods had not increased the demand.    Enquiries from China were not very good, for the reasons explained in Mr. PodweII&apos;s letter, which had been read to the meeting.    As regards India, enquiries had been coming forward.    In other countries no great improvement was expected.MR. WOODCOCK:   (Chemical trades):    Mr.  Woolcock said that only two or three per cent, of the employees in the chemical industry actually struck work.    The industry was  in a position that it could export any of its products, but the coal shortage would be felt in about ten days1  time.    The tar group would naturally be the most seriously affected.    The sulphuric acid industry was working at about one-third of normal.    As regards the alkali side four firms were pro-ducing a normal output, one had closed down,; and thirteen were working at from 35 to 80 per cent,  of normal.    The soap group was nearly normal.    Of the tar works, ten had stopped entirely, seven were normal,  and nine were working from 50 to 80 per cent.    In the fine chemical group there had been no great difficulties.    As to the dye-stuffs and intermediate group, three firms had closed down, ten of the larger ones were normal,  and eight were working 25 per cent, to    75 per cent.    Generally speaking, the industry was carrying on satisfactorily,  though difficulties of transport  and coal were naturally increasing.MR.  PARKER,  informed the  Committee that the boot trade which he represented only exported a small proportion of its production.    Before the war one-fifth was exported, mainly^ to the Dominions,  or out of a total of 100,000,000 pairs 20,000,000 pairs approximately went  abroad.    During the war, however, the&apos;Dominions had developed&apos; their own industries/
flnnf ident ial.llNDIA.industries and in some cases were actually exporting themselves.    The present position was that on an increased output some 13,000,000 pairs were exported in 1925. Prospects were, however, promising and the home demand was increasing.As regards the coal situation, many of the works were in the difficulty that they drew their supplies of power from municipal light and gas enterprises, and could only now get 50 per cent,  of their normal requirements.    As regards country works he thought they had enough coal for three or four weeks.MR. K.A-.F.  LINDSAY   said that the monsoon was due to break early in Juno, but there had been premature rain.    Fortunately, however, this had oeased.    This was a critical time; no less than 85 per cent,  of India&apos;s exports were directly dependent on the monsoon, including cotton piece goods made from Indian grown cotton.    He had just received the trade figures for 1925/1926 up to the end of the year - April 1st last. As regards Indian exports there had been a reduction in the British share from 25 per cent, to 21 per cent.    The reduction was mainly in wheat-, tea and barley, which accounted for 18 out of 19 crores of rupees of the diminution,As regards Indian imports the value of United Kingdom was 18 crores of rupees less year, of which 15 crores or five-sixths was cotton textiles.those from the than the previous accounted for by it must be remembered that these figures were of values and the reduction was due to some extent to a fall in price and to the rise of about 5 per cent,  in exchange with consequent lower rupee prices.As regards the there was a talk of of normal.   .jute crop, the prospects were good anda 10,000,000 bale crop, which was in excess[IRON &amp;       SIR WILLIAM LARKE.    As regards the IJEEh.&apos;       sir William Larke stated that this bad but was theiron and steel industry, generally was in a veryway.    Most of the blast furnaces had. now been damped down., one furnace was still producing pig iron,.    The industry entirely dependent upon coal, but  it was hoped to maintain furnaces damped down v^ithout allowing them to go cold.MR. BOND agreed with the last speaker firms engaged in heavy work were now i finishing industry, in South Wales thi extent of 33 1/3% of normal. The tin be able to continue for about three or of the opinion that if the coal strike in tin plate for fruit and vegetable p go to the U.S.A. This would be a seri our production was exported. He added continued for another month it would n new orders until October, owing to the prior commitments-that the bulk of the die.    As regards the s was working to an plate industry should four weeks.    He was was extended the trade acking must of necessity ous matter as 75% ofthat if the strike ot be possible to book necessity for fulfillingMR. PYBUS.   (Electrical Engineering):    As regards the strike -Mr. Pybus stated that engineers in the heavy electrical engineering industry generally were not called out.    At first was practically no diminution of output, but later on, a cutting down of electricity supplies,  some men of work.thereowing to the had. been put outHe/
dential.He said that at the beginning of the strike the export -trade had been adversely affected,  and. anxious enquiries had been received from abroad.    Now, however, more cheerful reports were being received from overseas.Mr.  Pybus also referred to an enquiry which had been received from Russia for 39 turbines and generators, the smallest of which was to be of a capacity of 10,000 kilowatts in connection with certain big power schemes.    Finance had not yet been arranged.MR.  GRAY BUCHANAN:  said   that business    generally with the East was good and&apos; he referred also to the excellent work done on behalf of British trade by Lord Lloyd in Egypt.
