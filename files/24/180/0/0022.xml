mfllMEWT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.In accordance with, the decision of the Standing Committee on Expenditure on 19th November last (8th conclusion) the operations of the Unemployment Grants Committee in respect of relief schemed for the season 1925-6 were greatly restricted.It has been the practice of the Committee to issue to Local Authorities in the early part of each year an invitation to submit relief schemes, for the following season.     This year such an invitation has not been issued, and the Committee had not proposed to issuo one, the Government decision of.last November boing taken to moan a complete stoppage of fresh grants after outstanding cases had been dealt with.Lord St. Davids in the Annexed note, asks whether this interpretation of the decision is correct, and refers to the aggravated position of unemployment caused by the genoral strike and by the coal trade stoppage.In my opinion nothing has as yet occurred to warrant a change of policy by the Government.     Unloss therefore, my colloagues desire to have the question reconsidered I propose to tell Lord St. Davids that for the present no action need be, or should be, taken to extend the grants for reliof schemes.     Outstanding cases, of which there are still some remaining,  should be doalt with on the lines decided upon last November and no new applications should be asked for or entertained.1JNEMPLOYMENT GRANTS 00?MI TTEE -CABINET.general  1(26)&apos;Memorandum by the Minister of Labour.(Intld. ) A *M .Ministry of Labour. 4th June,  19S3.
UMIMPLOYMENT G.RAFTS COMMITTEIL .  fete by tho Chairman.It haa been the practice of the Unemployment Grants Committee to issue in the early Spring of each year a Circular to Local Authorities inviting them to submit, for the approval of the Committee and for financial assistance if approved, proposals for works to relieve unemployment in their districts in the following Autumn and  /inter.The Government1 s decision of November last seemed however to the Committee clearly to indicate that this form of assigtanoe was to be gradually discontinued,  the first stage boing to limit assistance of this nature to areas suffering from very exceptional unemployment, and to impose more stringent conditions on the making of grants.In pursuance of this policy a Circular was issued to Local Authorities on the 15th December last, a copy of which is attached.*The Unemployment Grants Committee were accordingly not proposing to issue the usual Circular for this Spring nor indeed had they contemplated the issue of any further Circular to Local Authorities.They will be glad, however,  to know that this action is approved by the Government, especially in viow of the aggravated position of unemployment caused by the general strike and by the coal trade stoppage.(Sgd.) ST. DAVIDS.1st June,   1936.* Not oiroulateds already contained in C .P .^9 (36 ).
