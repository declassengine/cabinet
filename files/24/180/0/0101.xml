THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY 0? HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S Q0VER2QSBHT.SECRET. Copy No.CP. 300 (26). 0 A 3 I IT 35 I.REVISE. HOUSING.    RECONSIDERATION OP SUBSIDY.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Scotland.With reference to Memorandum CP. 290 (26) circulated by the Minister of Health, I desire to submit for ray oolleagues&apos; consideration the following observations on the minister-e Memorandum in relation to the Scottish housing situation.Paragraphs 1, 2 and 3.Ho comments.Paragraph 4.production.     The number of houses erected in Scotland with State assistance during the last 3i years is as follows:-1923 6,6X8 houses.1924. 4,382       &quot;1925. 8,201       &quot;1928 (6 months)     5,459       *In addition it is estimated that there are being erected without State assistance some 1,000 to 1,500 houses annually - a very small contribution.The largest number per annum built in Scotland since the War is   10,505 houses in 1922.   As something like 10,000 houses are required to meet the normal annual needs in Scotland it will be seen that the shortage has been increasing.   It is hoped this year to get at least 12,000 houses apart from steel houses under the Government&apos;s special scheme.Poet of building.     as in England there has been a slight rise during the past two years.   A 3-apartment flat inclusive of roads, sewers, etc, costs at present about  450.   That figure Is somewhat higher than in England,Financial Burden of Housing Subsidies in Scotland on Exchequer. The Board of Health Estimates&quot; WtJia&quot; year&quot;IMS/M Include  1.672/306 for housing subsidies.   This includes  977,926 for the Addison Scheme which will probably be somewhat Increased next year and thereafter may be expected to be constant for a long time.An output of 10,000 to 12,000 houses per annum would add approximately  100,000 annually to the above subsidies.   A cut of  1 per house would thus save only some  20,000 In all in the next two years. ;r
&apos; JOHN GILM0UR*.Scottish Office, Whitehall, S.W.1.30th July, 1926,Paragraph 5*The-Soottish looal authorities take up practiosuLly tho same position as the Engliah..Authorities and in-addition contend that owing to the speoial efforts recommended to them by the Government in the last 12 months there should not at present be any alteration of polioy.As regards the provision of houses for the poorest inhabitants, the greater proportion of the Soottish State-assisted houses have been houses of 3-apartments (living room and two bedrooms with scullery, bathroom and other conveniences). A considerable number of 2-apartment houses (living room, bedroom, scullery, bathroom and other conveniences) have also been pro-vided by local authorities.Paragraph ,6.While 1 am in complete agreement with the Minister of Health ae to the policy of a gradual abandonment of the subsidies for building, the seriousness of their burden and their crippling effect on other developments, I feel that the conditions in Scotland are such as to warrant special treatment. The special position of Scotland is recognised by the Minister of Health in paragraph 8 of his Memorandum, and I am clearly of opinion that a continuance of the present subsidy until October, 1928, is necessary if the present improved rate of progress in house building in Scotland is to he maintained.
