SECRET. Copy No.    CCP. 267 (28).CABINET.REPORT  OF  THE   SELECT   COMMITTEE  ON  ESTIMATES.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.THE First Report from the Select Committee on Estimates of the present Session (H.C. 59) contains a number of proposals in regard to the form and procedure for dealing with the Civil Service Estimates. These proposals fall into three groups :-I. Rearrangement of the Existing Votes in the Estimates; II. Constitution and procedure of the Estimates Committee; and III. Financial procedure of the House of Commons.I. Rearrangement of the Estimates.(a.) The Committee consider that the Estimates for the Civil Services are in urgent need of reclassification. They propose that all Votes representing activities controlled by or, linked to, a particular Ministry should be placed in groups so as to show the complete functions and expenditure of that Ministry so far as this can be done without splitting up existing Votes. With this in view, they suggest that the Civil Service Estimates should, in future, be divided into the following nine Classes (instead of the present eight classes) : I. Central Government and Finance.II. Imperial and Foreign.III. Law and Justice.IV. Education.V. Health, Labour and Insurance.VI. Trade and Industry.VII. Common Services (Works, Stationery, &amp;c).VIII. Non-effective Charges (Pensions).IX. Miscellaneous (Expiring Services).The Committee admit that it is not possible to group the Votes in any order which would appear completely logical to everyone, and all they claim for their proposal is that it is a rearrangement involving as few changes as possible which will group the Votes so as to present a more readily comprehensible view of the total cost of particular services.The form in which the Civil Service Estimates are presented to Parliament is primarily a question for the Treasury, but the criticism made by the Select Committee as to the need for a reclassification has real substance in it, and provided the new scheme gives general satisfaction and will be maintained in future, I consider that it should be adopted. Unless, therefore, any objection is raised by other Departments, I propose to announce that His Majesty&apos;s Government have decided to give effect to the Committee&apos;s recommendation on this point.If the recommendation is to be accepted at all, it is very desirable to adopt the detailed scheme put forward by the Committee with as little change as possible.So far as the Treasury is concerned, the only modification I propose relates to the classification of the Vote for the Friendly Societies Deficiency. This is a purely financial Vote and should, in my opinion, be put in Class I. The Committee left the point open (see Note 8 to the Appendix to the Committee&apos;s Report).[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government. ] Printed for the Cabinet.   july 1926.
It should be mentioned that the increase in the number of classes might, and normally would, entail one or even two extra divisions at the close of the days allotted for Supply when the remaining Votes and Reports are taken by Classes, but the necessary time can, no doubt, be allowed for this.(b.) The Committee further recommend that the Civil Service Estimates should in future be called the Civil Estimates &quot; in order to dispel a common illusion that the bulk of the money voted in these Estimates goes in the payment of Civil Servants&apos; salaries.&quot;I agree, in principle, with this proposal and I should like to put it into effect also. It may, however, be held to entail a minor amendment of Standing Orders, which refer to the &quot; Civil Service Estimates &quot; (e.g., S.O. 17).(c.) As a matter of detail, the Committee recommend that the Rates Department Vote (Class I, Vote 13) should be amplified so as to show the amounts of rates paid for each Department, distinguishing between rates paid for Headquarter Offices in London and those paid for Offices or buildings elsewhere. I see no objection to adding a statement to the Rates Vote, showing, in detail by Departments, the amounts to be expended (which are, at present, given in the statements of Allied Services appended to each Departmental Vote). The figures could also be given in such a form as to distinguish between Headquarters and Local Offices, but I am not clear that this information would serve any useful purpose, and the separate figures for Headquarters might he used to show that the Government is not paying its fair proportion of the Westminster rates. It is important not to disclose the individual assessments on which the Government pays contributions in lieu of rates, and I think the Committee should be content with a statement of the total rates paid in respect of each Department.II. Constitution and Procedure of the Estimates Committee.The Report recommends that the Estimates Committee, now numbering twenty-eight members, should be increased in size so that all the Estimates, including, of course, those of the Fighting Services, may be examined every year. It is proposed that the examination should be conducted by Sub-Committees, each of which would examine two or three Classes of Votes and report to the main Committee. As the work would be onerous and detailed, the members of the Committee should, they think, he excused from service on all Private Bill Committees and also, if they so desire, on all Standing Committees. The Committee recall the suggestion previously made that they should have the assistance of a skilled Parliamentary Officer (on the assumed analogy of the Comptroller and Auditor-General). They realise, however, that this suggestion cannot be carried out, and they suggest instead that the Com-mittee should have the same power as the National Expenditure Committee of 1920 was given to appoint from outside its own body such additional persons as it may think fit to serve in an advisory capacity on any Sub-Committee which it may appoint.These proposals involve considering the whole question of the functions of the Estimates Committee. At present the Committee, whilst debarred from considering questions of policy, is competent to deal with more or less general questions arising on the Estimates, e.g., the methods Of framing Estimates, the measures to.be taken to [minimise Revotes, ithe allowance to be made for delays on the Works Votes, questions as to the expenditure on Statistics and Card Indices, &amp;c, with a more detailed survey, as a test, of some particular group of Estimates. If this is the function of the Committee, it is quite unnecessary for them to examine all the Estimates in detail every year. They can make a general survey of the Estimates as a whole, or they.can go more closely into a group of Estimates, without reviewing them all ;every year. The most sensible arrangement would be for the Committee to establish their programme in four blocks, so as to cover the whole ground of the Estimates in about four years. This is in essence the arrangement recommended in the Report, for the drafting of which I was responsible, of a Select Committee of the House of Commons in 1902. Such a task the Estimates Committee should be able to perform without any addition to their numbers. The Public Accounts Committee, meeting twice a week, manage to get through the Appropriation Accounts without any Sub-Committee (though it is true that the Report of the Comptroller and Auditor-General enables them to concentrate on the more important questions), and the Estimates Committee already numbers twenty-eight members as compared with fifteen members of the Public Accounts Committee.From the point of view of Departments, the appointment of numerous Sub-
Committees to examine the Estimates would constitute a very serious tax on the time of Heads of Departments. During -the past few years there have been cases in which the Estimates Committee has taken evidence from the Head of a single Department for nine days, and the average is about five days. If this was to be the habitual pro-cedure each year for all Departments, it would seriously interfere with the conduct&apos;oi public business.From the point of view of the -Government, the proposal is equally open; to objection. If the Estimates Committee and Sub-Committees are to go in detail into all the Estimates each year, it is very unlikely that they will avoid questions of policy. A tendency to become involved in questions of policy or to demand that their consideration of estimates should take place before the estimates are fixed by the Government and presented to Parliament will be the next step, and the Committee will inevitably try to secure for themselves a position akin to the continental type of Estimates Committee an institution wholly foreign to British constitutional theory and Parliamentary practice.Still more objectionable is the proposal to appoint outsiders to the Sub-Committees. The precedent of the Select Committee on National Expenditure referred to in the Report is not in point, as the right to co-opt outsiders was conferred on that Committee as a very special arrangement in regard to their deliberations on the form of Public Accounts, &amp;c. For f his purpose it was possibly desirable that the Committee should be assisted by outside experts, but it would be wholly unconstitu-tional for outsiders to serve on Parliamentary Committees charged with the detailed examination of Departmental administration as reflected in the Estimates. Much, of course, would depend on the actual persons who might be appointed, but it is more than probable that the candidates who would put themselves forward for appointment would be disgruntled busybodies or officious wiseacres who would make themselves a nuisance. One cannot conceive any advantage in giving people like Lord Olivier an opportunity of airing their views as members of Parliamentary Sub-Committees. If there is any question of appointing outsiders, it would be essential to prescribe that the appointments should be made not by the Committee but by the House itself on the motion of the Government Whip.On the other hand, the Committee are entitled to expect expert assistance from the Treasury, and I have considered what can be done in this direction. The appointment of a special Examiner of Estimates, with powers similar to those of the Comptroller and Auditor-General, would, as the Committee themselves recognise, be unconstitutional and impracticable. The Estimates, when they come before the Committee, have been approved by the Government, and Departmental officers cannot be called upon to criticise the decisions thus taken. Nor can a Parliamentary Committee have the same access to confidential papers as could be given, e.g., to the Geddes Committee, which was appointed to advise the Chancellor of the Exchequer. These limitations will have to be made clear, but, subject to them, I think it would be useful to arrange that a Treasury witness should attend the meetings of the Committee regularly and give them such assistance as he can, and I believe that such a proposal would be welcomed by the Committee.The recommendations of the Committee on this question, therefore, raise matters of high policy, but, in my view, the decision of His Majesty&apos;s Government should be (1.) That the Estimates Committee must, as hitherto, be precluded from examining into questions of policy;(2.) That their present numbers are amply sufficient to enable them to give effect to their terms of reference with reasonable thoroughness;(3.) That they are entitled to appoint Sub-Committees, but that these Sub-Committees ought to be confined to their own members;(4.) That members of the Estimates Committee cannot be given special privileges as regards exemption from service on other Parliamentary Committees.On the other hand, I recommend (5.) That arrangements should be made for a Treasury witness to attend the meetings of the Committee and assist fhem so far as he can.III. Modification of the Financial Procedure of the House of Commons.The Committee make a number of recommendations affecting Parliamentary procedure which, if pressed, would have to be examined in consultation with the Officers of the House and with the Party Whips.
(a.) The Committee recommend that the existing procedure under which the Speaker is &apos;&apos; moved out of the Chair &apos;&apos; three times on Votes for the Fighting Services and once only on the Civil Estimates, should be reconsidered. They suggest that the four days on which the motion that the Speaker leave the Chair can be debated should, in future, be allotted as follows : 1 day for the Fighting Services;1 day for the Imperial and Foreign Estimates;1 day for Central Government, Finance, Law and Justice, Common Servicesand Pensions; and 1 day for Education, Health, Labour, Trade and Industry, &amp;c.The present procedure is laid down in Standing Order 17. Though, in its present form, it dates only from 1902,* it has its origin in the ancient principle of redress of grievances before Supply, and the House is likely to be jealous of any curtailment of its present rights. The Committee&apos;s proposal, if adopted, would allow only one day for general discussion on the three Fighting Services as opposed to five days for the Civil Departments. For the Committee have apparently overlooked the fact that two additional days are available for Civil Service matters in the Committee and Report stages of the Vote on Account. These latter are really far more valuable than the former, for, by custom, the Opposition select the Votes for discussion on the Vote on Account, whereas the choice of topics for discussion on &quot;moving the Speaker out &quot;is settled by ballot. As there is no Vote on Account for the Fighting Services, the only occasion for a general discussion is on first goino-into Committee of Supply or on Vote A in Committee of Supply.Under the present practice, the necessary Votes for each of the Fighting Services (which must be taken before the 31st March to provide funds to meet expenditure till the Summer Consolidated Fund Act is passed) are usually obtained on the same day as the Speaker is moved out of the Chair : if this is not done for any service a further day has to be given, but this day counts against the allotted Supply days. If the Committee&apos;s object is to be attained, and two of the days at present given to the Fighting Services utilised for general discussion of Civil Estimates, the resolutions for moving the Speaker out of the Chair and the necessary Votes for each of the Fighting Services must all be obtained on the same day. In that event, either each of the Ministers responsible for these Departments would have to make his general statement on the same day, leaving little time for debate, or only one of them would be able to make his general statement, and the Votes for the other Services would have to be obtained without any general statement from the Minister in charge. If this were not done, the Committee&apos;s object would not be achieved; additional days would have to be found for getting the necessary Service Votes before the 31st March, but these days would reduce the number of allotted days available for discussion of Civil Votes after the 31st March. The net effect, there-fore, would be merely to increase the number of Supply days that have to be allotted before the 31st March and to reduce the number remaining to be taken after the 31st March a most undesirable result, having regard to the usual congestion of Parliamentary business at the end of the financial year.But it is far from clear that the proposal made by the Select Committee really represents the views of the House. The shortening of military and naval discussions is not likely to be favoured either by the Members interested in the Fighting Services or by their critics on the Opposition side. The result of the proposal might well be that finally the number of days on which the motion might be debated would have to be increased from four to six, with consequent expenditure of Parliamentary time that could not be justified, even though it would probably be after the 31st March.It appears to me that it would be ill-advised to alter the present Standing Order, and I understand that, as a result of discussion with the Whips Office, the Chairman of the Estimates Committee has agreed to drop this proposal.(6) The Committee have considered the possibility of revising the form of the Estimates so as to include in each Vote not only the expenditure accounted for by the Department concerned but also the expenditure on buildings, rates, stationery, Postal services, &amp;c, incurred by the Common Services on its behalf. They advise, quite rightly, that it would be undesirable to alter the existing system of centralised accounting for such items, which are at present not included in the Estimate of a Department, but shown in a footnote, so that the total expenditure in connection with a Department can readily be ascertained. They draw attention, however, to a Parliamentary  difficulty,  viz., that at present the discussion of the office* Provision for the Air Estimates was, of course, made at a later date.
accommodation of a Department may be ruled out of order in debate on the Vote for that Department, and they recommend that discussion should be permitted on any item (other than those specifically chargeable on the Consolidated Fund) which is included under the Allied Services shown in the footnote to the Vote.The present rule of order, though in general convenient enough, is, no doubt, occasionally an irritating limitation on Parliamentary discussion, and it is desirable to meet the Committee&apos;s object, if possible. But the solution they propose is equally open to serious objection, and goes, I think, beyond what is necessary to meet the occasional difficulty. It would enable the discussion of Works, Stationery, Postal facilities, &amp;c, on every single Vote, and necessitate, e.g., the First Commissioner of Works or his representative, being constantly available for the purpose. I understand that- at present the question whether any such discussion is admissible or not depends very much on the discretion of the Chair. Erskine May (page 538) says : &quot; When the responsibility of two Departments has been involved in a policy, the action of both Departments has been allowed to be discussed on the Vote for one of them, but such a departure from the ordinary method of discussion in Committee of Supply is only permitted with the general consent of the Committee.&quot; If a genuine debate on the policy adopted in regard, e.g., to Employment Exchange buildings were desired, no doubt it could be arranged in this way. Further, there does not seem to be any reason why Members should not be able to discuss the general policy of a Ministry in regard to its buildings when the Ministers&apos; Vote is being taken, but any discussion of questions of detail which would bring in the responsibility of the Office of Works should certainly be ruled out of order. In particular, it is of primary importance to keep the rules of discussion on Supplementary Estimates as tight as possible, as debate on Supplementary Estimates is usually confined to the February batch when time is short.I suggest, therefore, that it would be sufficient to get some agreement with the Chair that, subject to notice being given of the desire for such discussion, the rules of debate should be relaxed so as to permit discussion on any Vote (but not on Supplementaries) of the general policy in regard to Allied Services in connection with that Vote, i.e., that a fairly liberal interpretation should be given to the principle laid down by Erskine May..(c.) The Committee recommend that the Opposition should be entitled to select the Reports of the Estimates Committee as subjects for discussion on allotted Supply days, and, further, that, if they do not exercise this right, the Chairman of Ways and Means, on a request from the Chairman of the Estimates Committee, should be empowered to arrange with the Government for an extra day to be allotted under Standing Order 15 (4) for the discussion of these Reports.I do not see much advantage in this proposal. In so far as the Reports of the Committee deal with individual Votes, they can, of course, be discussed with the Votes referred to. If, on the other hand, they deal with general questions of form and procedure, the Committee of Supply is not the proper place for the discussion. The Speaker ought to be present at all discussions on procedure, and it should rest with the Government of the day to decide whether the subject ought to be discussed. If, then, such discussion is considered desirable, it should be in the House and not in Committee. As, under the Committee&apos;s proposal, the Chairman of Ways and Means would have to obtain an extra allotted day (under Standing 0&apos;rder 15 (4)), discussion in the House on the proposal of the Government will not involve any further time than if the Committee&apos;s proposal were adopted, but either proposal would involve an extra day, as compared with existing arrangements.Further, it is improbable that the House will want to spend a full day on the discussion of these Reports, and the proposal might lead to a loss of valuable Parlia-mentary time. If a discussion were desired, it should be sufficient to put it down as the first order and pass on to other business after a couple of hours&apos; debate.A similar proposal was made in 1903 by the Select Committee on National Expenditure with regard to the Reports of the Public Accounts Committee, but it was not adopted, and I consider that it should be sufficient for the Government to say that, if there is a general wish, intimated through the usual channels, for a discussion on the Committee&apos;s Reports, the Government will do its best to arrange a ^suitable occasion, but that they do not feel it desirable to lay down a formal rule in the matter.On the other hand, I think it will be very desirable that, so far as possible, the Committee should have issued their Report on the particular Estimates which they [14825] c
review each year before these Estimates are debated in the House. It will be, in my view, of immense advantage if the House could discuss the Estimate for a Department with the printed report before them upon the expenditure of that Department, prepared by the Committee after hearing witnesses. The rule should not be absolute, but only what should be aimed at, as the Government could not undertake to hold up discussion until the Estimates Committee have reported. Any hard and fast rule would lead to considerable difficulties in getting on with the business of the House, and it was rejected on this ground, after discussion with the Speaker and with certain members of the Opposition, in 1921. But we can at least suggest to the Estimates Committee that they should aim at producing their reports on particular Estimates, or groups of Estimates, so far as they can, before such Estimates are finally disposed of in Supply; and if the Committee are known to be preparing a report on a particular Vote, the Whips can, no doubt, arrange to defer this Vote pending the issue of the Committee&apos;s report unless the Opposition, for any reason, insists on having it discussed immediately.Summary.1. I propose, therefore, subject to the consent of my colleagues (a.) To accept the recommendations of the Committee in regard to the reclassifi-cation of the Estimates ; (&amp;.) To accept the change of title to &quot; Civil Estimates.&quot;2. I recommend that the Government should decide to reject the proposals relating to the enlargement of the Estimates Committee and the extension of its powers; but I propose, to arrange that a Treasury witness should regularly attend the sittings of the Committee; and3. I suggest that the Chief Whip should arrange with Mr. Speaker to meet, so far as can be done by arrangement without any formal alteration of existing rules, the points raised by the Committee in regard to the scope of discussion on Estimates. I propose, also, to suggest to the Committee that they should endeavour, so far as possible, to complete the review of particular Estimates before they are finally disposed of in Supply, so that the House can discuss these Estimates with the Report of the Committee before them.I attach herewith copy of the question which Colonel Henderson has put down and of the reply which I propose should be given thereto.I should propose, following precedent with Reports of the Public Accounts Committee and with certain instances of previous Reports of the Estimates Committee, to convey the decision to the Committee formally by means of a Treasury Minute on their Report.There is another question, not dealt with in the Committee&apos;s Report, which it would be convenient to refer to here. No part of the Parliamentary Session is consumed to less advantage than the long time spent on the Spring Supplementary Estimates. This year no fewer than twelve days were required to dispose of thein. The discussions are, or ought to be, strictly confined to limited points. They conduce neither to the control of expenditure nor to the ventilation of grievances, but merely afford pegs for aimless discussion of a petty character. The attempts we are making to reach a higher and closer standard of budgeting necessarily involve that there will be fewer surrenders of money by Departments at the end of the year, and more small Supplementaries. If this is so, we must expect each year a very large block of Supplementaries not aggregating any formidable sum. To devote twelve days of Parliamentary time to discussing a block of expenditure which in the aggregate this year was only just over  5 million was surely a very unthrifty use of the limited time available for financial control by &quot;Parliament. It was, in fact, about one-fifth of the number of Parliamentary days available for finance in all its forms, and was devoted to a frittering discussion covering little more than one-two hundredth part of the expenditure. I am sure it would be possible to explain this matter to the House in a manner that would gain their general support, more especially if the ground were prepared beforehand by discussion, say, with Mr. Runciman and Mr. Snowden.   My suggestion would be that the Supply Rule should be remodelled
to cover Supplementary Estimates, not more than five nor less than three days being devoted to these, and the Opposition given the choice of specifying the subjects and arranging the time, after which the Supplementaries would be closured just in the same way as the main supply. The Summer Supplementaries have not caused any serious difficulty or delay, and it is not certain that they require to be brought into the ambit of a revised Supply Rule. The saving of time on the Supplementaries should make it possible for the discussion of the report of the Estimates Committee on the block of estimates of the current year which has yet to be examined, as well as if desired, for a day on the estimates of the three Fighting Services combined.W. S. C.Treaswy Chambers, July 12, 1926.APPENDIX.Lieutenant-Colonel Vivian Henderson, To ask the Prime Minister, whether he has as yet had an opportunity of considering the first Report of the Estimates Committee this Session; and, if so, what action, if any, the Government propose to take in regard to the committee&apos;s recommendations as to the reclassification and regrouping of the Estimates; as to the future size and composition of the committee; as to discussion of the committee&apos;s Reports on Supply days; and as to the present limits of discussion when the main Estimates are under considera-tion, respectively (Thursday, the 15th July).The Government accept the recommendations of the Select Committee in regard to the reclassification and regrouping of Estimates and they will give effect to them, subject to some minor emendations, in next year&apos;s Estimates.The Government do not see their way to adopt the recommendations as to the future size and composition of the Committee. It appears to them that the Committee should aim at reviewing a group of Estimates each year so as to cover the full field every four or five years and should endeavour as far as possible to complete this review before the particular group are finally disposed of in Supply. This they consider the Committee should be able to do without additional members or special facilities. In particular, they do not consider that persons outside the House should be appointed to serve on Sub-Committees, but they are prepared to arrange that a Treasury witness should attend the meetings of the Committee, and assist them so far as he can.As regards the last two questions, which relate to the procedure of the House, the Government consider that the objects in view can be arranged through the usual channels, if generally desired, without any formal modification of Standing Orders, and they consider that this procedure will be preferable.o
