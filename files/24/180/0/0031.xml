fTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTYrS  GOVERNMENT).memorandum prepared in the Treasury in regard to the accommodation in London of the Mng&apos;s sone.      There would appear %o he no reason why the Government should not express to His Mr. jesty their willingness to introduce legislation on the lines suggested at some suitable time.    But it is clearly quite impossible to do so in the present session end it is at the moment very difficult to foresee when legislation will be practicable.     At whatever time we try to carry out this perfectly reasonable arrangement a certain amount of ill-natured comment is to be expected.SBCBET.C. P.221(26).C A B ,,I.

mThe Keeper of the Privy Purse suggests that an exchange should &quot;be effected of certain Grace and Favour residences in Richmond and Bushey Pafks, now in the disposal of Bis Mr.jesty, in return for London residences for His Majesty&apos;s sons.When the Sovereign at his accession places the hereditary revenues at the disposal of Parliament, certain Residences ere excepted end placed at Eis disposal; these are called Grace and Favour Residences.The  four residences in question with their present occupants and the estimated rent which might be obtained on a lease of the houses, the State being responsible for external end structural repair, are as followsResidence.

for the life-time of the grantee.   Most of them are in the charge of the Office of Works hut a few are in the charge of the Crown Lands Office.    Sir P. Ponsonby states that these four houses are quite useless to the King and whenever one of them becomes vacant, it is a matter of great difficulty to find anyone with the remotest claim to accept it.    Only one of them, however, would in the event of the proposed exchange being effected, be available for disposal on lease in the immediate future, viz: White Lodge at Richmond Park, now occupied by Their Royal Highnesses the Duke and Duohess of York.It is understood that owing to their numerous public engagements Their Royal Highnesses have found that the White Lodge is inconveniently situated in view of its distance from London ana They would like to have a permanent residence in London.    A proposql was therefore recently considered under which the white Lodge would, with the King1 s Consent, be handed over to a Public Department to be let on lease and the rent received would be made available for taking a town house for the Duke of York. Counsel, however,  advised that no Public Department would have the power at law to let the White Lodge,  and that though it might bo possible for the King to do so,  the rent received would in that case have to be paid to the Consolidated Fund.   :The present proposal to deal with four residences in exchange for houses for His Majssty&quot;s sons and to introduce legislation into Parliament making this possible is a development of the former proposal.Prom the Exchequer point of view there would be no objeotion to a proposal for an exchange which did not involve additional charge to the tax-payer and there seems no reason to anticipate that in the long run the-a-
proposed exchange would be  disadvantageous to the Exchequer.;    There mieht be difficulty in finding from the existing Crown estste vacant houses in London suitable for the accommodation of the Royal Princes at the time when they are required,- but it would be a comparatively simple matter to rent other houses from the proceeds of the leases of the Grace and Favour residences if the necessary powers were obtained by legislati.on.Apart from the houses and suites allotted to Members of the Household,  there are at present eight houses in London which are occupied by Members of the Royal Family, via:York House Marlborough House 78, Pall MallResidences inKensington PalaceClarence HousePrince of Wales.
