(IHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S  GOVERNMENT ) .S E G RET.COPY NO:CP. 230  (26) .CABINET.LANE PICTURES BEQUEST.Note by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.With reference to CP. 219 (26)  I wrote to Mr. Cosgrave on June 3rd saying that we were anxious to make an announcement on the subject of the Lane Pictures as soon as possible, and asking whether he could therefore let me have an early reply to my letter of May 27th.     At the same time I sent a copy of this letter to the Governor-General saying that if he . could assist in any way to   expedite matters, we should be grateful to him.I have now received the following letter from the Governor-General:-&quot;My dear Dominions Secretary,In compliance with yours of-yesterday I called on President Cosgrave today and to speak frankly he expressed himself in terms of bitter disappointment at the decision of the Cabinet, as to the Lane Pictures conveyed in your letter to him of 27th May.      I am afraid he is not disposed to reply to it, at an early date, as the matter is regarded as  of paramount importance by himself and his colleagues.    He repeated several times that were a parallel case to arise affect/ing any other DominionSaturday,  5.6.26.no such decision would belong one, and the fore going-convey s the &quot;barest summaryof the arguments employed.-1-
I therefore think it my duty to convey his views. I write in haste for post&quot;.Yours faithfully,(Signed)    T .1.1. HEALY .The Rt,I!on. L .S . . Amery , -M .P ,, Dominions Secretary&quot; .In view of the necessity of fixing an early date for the opening of the I.1 ate Gallery extension,  I do not think vie can wait indefinitely for a reply to my letter from Mr .. G osgr ave . -    The final decision in this matter rests solely with us:    that decision was taken, after very full consideration, by the Cabinet at their meeting of June 2ndj and there would not 8ppear to be anything in Dr. H ealy&apos;a letter which should lead us to regard the matter as being still open for further discussion.In the circumstances it seems to me that we shouldafter giving proper notice of our intention to the Free StateGovernment, publish the Report of the Committee and announceprobablyour decision thereon.    If -will/be most convenient that  that announcement should   take        the form of a reply to a Parliamentary Question, and I annex a draft Question and reply for that purpose..I also annex drafts of letters to hr. C osgr ave and to the Governor-General giving them notice of our intention to publish the Report and announce, our decision thereon.L . S .A .Dominions Office. 8 June,  19 2 6,,
DRAffT Pa&apos;HIiIAEbiNTABY aUESTIOH &quot;&quot;&quot;AMD REPLY.Mr ^_.    To ask tho Prime Minis teirwhat action his Majesty&apos;s Government propose to take on the Report of the Committee appointed by the late Government to consider certain questions relating to the 39 pictures bequeathed under the Will of tho late Sir Hugh lane to the national Gallery in London.The Prime Minister.      His Majesty&apos;s Government have given very careful consideration over a prolonged period to the whole matter dealt with in this Report and they have deoidoa that they must accept the conclusion reached by the Committee, that it would be imiJi-oper to modify Sir Hugh Lano&apos;s Will by legislation.They have, however, received an assurance from the ihrusteos of the Rational Gallery that it is their Present intention to lend to Dublin a substantial number of tha pictures in question from time to time and for a substantial period,  as soon as they are empowered to do so under Section 4 of tha National
Gallery (loan) Act. 1883, that is to say at the expiration of 15 years from the date when the pictures came under their possession, whether a special Gallery has then been provided in Lublin or not.I may add that should the Government of the Irish Eree State now or at any future time express any desire for a removal of! the obstacle imposed by the Act of 1883 in the way of an immediate loan, His Majesty&apos;s Government would be very ready to consider the introduction of legislation for that purpose.
Draft Letter to the President of the executive Qounoll.Bear Mr, Cosgrave,As it is necessary to make early arrangements for the opening (which must take place during the present season) of the Duveen Gallery, and. as it will be very desirable that the decision of His Majesty&apos;s Government regarding the Lane Pictures should be known before that Sate, we propose to publish the Report of tho Wilson Committee in about 10 days time, and thereafter to stato in Parliament our decision on that Report.-l t 1 enclose for your information and that of yourm t ion ^Answer.colleagues, a copy of the form in which we propose to state our decision.Yours sincerely,
III.137DRAFT LETTER TO TilE COVERS OR-- GENERAL.JPERSONAL.My dear Governor- General,I am grateful for your letter ofthe 5th instant regarding the lane Pictures.I am afraid that,  in view of the necessityfor making early arrangements for the opening ofthe Duveen Gallery, it will be impossible for us t opostpone for more than a very short period, theannouncement of our decision regarding these pictures:liter (compo draft )n and indeed I do not see that any useful purpose would fo Mr*  Cosgrave.&apos; be served by such a postponement.I have therefore written to Mr.  Cosgrave a letter of which I enclose a copy for your information.I would  only add that Mr.  Cosgrave is altogether mistaken if he thinks that we have con-sidered this  question otherwise than purely on its merits.    Pad any other Dominion in similar circumstances suggested that the legal  effect of the Will should be varied by legislation exactly the same considerations, would have arisen as were before us in the present case, and,  I am confident,  our decision would have been the s ame.Yours sincerely,
