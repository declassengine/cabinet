[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.1Printed for the Committee of Civil Research.   July 1926SECRET.Copy No.7C.R. (O-17.COMMITTEE OF CIVIL RESEARCH.REPORT OF THE SUB-COMMITTEE ON AGRICULTURAL TRAINING.AT their Meeting held on Wednesday, the 21st April, 1926 (Cabinet (18) 26, &apos; Conclusion 3), the Cabinet agreed (a.) That a Committee should be set up, under the Committee of Civil Research, to advise as to schemes and methods of training which could advan-tageously be adopted in Great Britain with a view to fitting (1) adults, and (2) juveniles, from the urban areas, for employment in agriculture either in this country or within the Empire Overseas;(b.) That the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries, in consultation with other Ministers concerned, should advise the Prime Minister as to the compo-sition of the Committee.2.   The Sub-Committee was constituted by the Prime Minister as follows : Right Hon. Lord Bledisloe,K.B.E., Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministryof Agriculture and Fisheries (Chairman). Sir Robert Greig, M.C., Chairman of the Board of Agriculture forScotland.Mr. J. A. N. Barlow, C.B.E., Principal Assistant Secretary, Ministry of Labour.Mr. A. Abbott, C.B.E., Chief Inspector of Technical and ContinuationSchools, Board of Education. Mr. M. F. Headlam, C.B., Assistant Secretary, Treasury. Mr. T. C. Macnaghten, C.M.G., C.B.E., Vice-Chairman, Oversea Settle-ment Committee, Dominions Office. Mr. Walter Smith.Mr. R. R. Robbins, C.B.E., Past President, National Farmers&apos; Union. Mr. Kenneth Lindsay, M.A., Toynbee Hall. Dr. G. C. Cossar,M.C.Mr. Christopher Turnor, Oversea Settlement Committee.3. On the 10th July, 1926, Mr. Macnaghten left England with the Chairman of the Oversea Settlement Committee on a visit to Canada and his place on the Sub-Committee was taken by Mr. E. T. Crutchley, C.B.E.4. We have thought it desirable to examine schemes at present in operation for the training of townspeople for the land with a.view to ascertaining what methods of training experience shows to have been most successful.1. -Composition and Terms of Reference.Mr. A. F. Hemming, C.B.E.. Mr. D. B. Toye, O.B.E.,Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries.II. Existing Training Schemes[14870]b
(a.) Clay don and Brandon.5. In particular we have directed our attention to the centres established by the Ministry of Labour at Claydon and Brandon. These centres are at present only in an experimental stage, but instructive lessons may be drawn from the difficulties that the Ministry of Labour have had to overcome. Each is intended to have a capacity for training annually 300 men for oversea settlement and&quot; 50 &quot; handy-men&quot; f0&quot;i employment in this country. The present view of the Ministry is that it would be a false economy to attempt to run courses for a larger number of trainees at any one centre, as the present numbers are as much as a Manager can efficiently control. The training consists at the longest of a six months&apos; course. These centres have at present an annual capacity for training 510 persons for oversea settlement on the land and 200 for home employment in industry. The average running cost per head at these centres is at present  44.(b.) Catterick.6. The War Office have established at Catterick a vocational training centre for soldiers during the last six months of their colour service. The annual capacity is 200. The cost per head of the six months&apos; course, excluding Army pay and allow-ances, is approximately  28 10s.; but as this sum excludes Army pay and allowances and accommodation the figure is not comparable with that of the Ministry of Labour&apos;s centr.es..(c.) Voluntary Agencies.7. There are a number of voluntary agencies for training juveniles from the towns, but, with the exception of Cornton Vale and the Labour Colony of the Central Unemployed Body at Hollesley Bay, which was intended partly to fulfil the purpose of a training centre, but is now used substantially as a workhouse, there is at present no voluntary organisation for the training of adults for work on the land.8. As regards juveniles there are, however, a number of centres which are doing highly successful work. The course varies from four to twelve weeks at Dr. Cossar&apos;s farm at Craigielinn, Glasgow, to two years at Mr. Fegan&apos;s Canada training farm in Kent. Similarly, the annual capacity varies from 700 at the Salvation Army Farm at Hadleigh, Essex, to 75 at Mr. Fegan&apos;s farm. The maximum cost to the State of these trainees ranges from  8 16s. to  10 per head, but in some cases the whole cost of the training is provided from voluntary sources without any grant from public funds.(d.) Capacity of existing Training Centres.9. So far as we have been able to ascertain, the number of persons that could at present be accommodated at existing training centres in this country, including those of the Ministry of Labour, is approximately 3,385, but of those under training only 1,885 are destined for oversea settlement. Of the latter figure 510 are adults and 1,375 are juveniles.III. General Considerations.10. Before submitting our recommendations to the Committee of Civil Eesearch for the establishment of further facilities for the training of townspeople for employment on the land, we desire to place on record certain considerations of a general character which in our view require careful attention in the framing of a sound scheme for training.(a.) Relation of Schemes for Oversea Settlement to those for work on the land in this Country.11. We have been much impressed by the view which has been strongly put before us that there may be opposition to the increase of facilities for oversea settlement, unless at the same time facilities are also provided (not necessarily on a large scale) for the training and settlement of townspeople on land in this country. There is, we are convinced, a widespread belief in this country and in the Dominions that the main object of the Government schemes for migration within the Empire is to move the unemployed out of this country, where they cannot hope to secure fresh means of obtaining a livelihood. We feel that this psychological factor is of great importance, and that Empire settlement will continue to be prejudiced until adequate
steps have been taken to eradicate this ill-founded opinion. The surest way of securing this end will be to satisfy the leaders of working-class opinion that the Government not only have no such object in view, but that, on the contrary, they are anxious, so far as in them lies, to open up fresh avenues of employment in this country. . We believe that the best way by which the Government can secure whole^ hearted support for their migration schemes will be to start a bond fide, though not necessarily ambitious, scheme for the training and settlement of townspeople on the land in this country. We think, moreover, that special provision should, in addition, be made to meet the exceptional circumstances of the coal industry, where large numbers of miners cannot hope to secure further employment in the industry to which they have been bred. Our recommendations on this head are set out in paragraphs 42 and 43 of our Report.(b.) Differentiation between Training Schemes for Adults and Juveniles.12. In our recommendations for training we have drawn a sharp distinction between adults and juveniles. This distinction is, in our opinion, of cardinal importance. No scheme can hope to be successful unless adequate steps are taken to deal separately with adolescents and adults, during the period of training. This is clearly necessary for educational and moral reasons.(c.) Definition of Juveniles.13. We have carefully considered what age should be selected as the dividing line between adults and juveniles. The Dominions Office have found by experience that 16 years is about the most suitable age from the point of view of oversea settle-ment, and have concentrated their attention on securing boys of from this age to 21. Somewhat different considerations would apply if, as we recommend, boys are to be trained in special centres established for the purpose. The Board of Education regard boys and girls from 14 to 18 as &quot; young persons,&quot; and on the whole we recom-mend that the same limits should be adopted for the training schemes put forward in this Report.(d.) Selection of Candidates.14. We have been much impressed in our enquiry by the importance of ensuring preliminary selection of candidates before they are admitted to courses of training. Voluntary Agencies in many cases select boys living in towns in exceptionally poor surroundings, who often on this account are, for their age, undersized and undeveloped. We have the highest admiration for the fine work done in this field by many of these organisations, but we consider that so far as Government schemes are concerned care should be taken to ensure in the case of both adults and juveniles that persons selected for training at the cost of the State should physically and otherwise be of such a standard as would give a reasonable prospect of their training being of permanent value. No doubt the physical condition of town-bred people is often greatly improved by a few months&apos; life on the land, and on this account we should be prepared to recommend that a percentage of vacancies should be reserved for trainees who fall slightly short of the required standards. Such cases should, however, be regarded as exceptional. In general, candidates for overseas should only be accepted if they possess the physical and other qualifications laid down by the Dominion Governments.(e.) Area of Recruitment.15. So far as Claydon and Brandon are concerned, trainees :*re drawn from persons from the large towns who are carefully selected by the Managers of the Employment Exchanges. Candidates after selection have, moreover, to be approved by the Dominion representative in this country. The Ministry of Labour are satisfied that there is excellent material to be obtained from the large cities, and that in volume it is sufficient to feed any training schemes that the Government may decide to establish. Experience shows that the town-bred man is not necessarily inferior to the country-bred man as a potential agricultural worker.16. If the time and money devoted to training are not to be wasted, we are satisfied that candidates should be carefully selected before being accepted for training by the State. We believe that the present system of the Ministry of Labour is substantially sound in respect of adults, and subject to what we have said in regard to the treatment of exceptional cases, we consider that similar arrangements [14870] B 2
should be made for the selection of candidates for further training schemes, aided or maintained by the State. We realise, however, that the system of selecting juveniles should be more elastic than for adults. &quot;(/.) Definition of Urban Areas.17. Our terms of reference are limited to considering the training of persons from &quot; urban areas.&quot; We consider this expression to mean the great cities rather than the smaller towns in country districts, for we believe that there are many country-bred men living in the large towns to which they have moved only on account of the nature of their emplcyment, who are genuinely anxious that their children should, if possible, return to the country. In London, for example, many of the building operatives and of the Metropolitan Police are country-bred men whose children are admirably suited for employment on the land. We consider that especially in regard to schemes for employment in Great Britain an effort should be made to secure candidates drawn from this class.IV. Training Schemes for Men. (a.) Training for Employment in Great Britain.18. There is no doubt a shortage of skilled farm hands in some parts of Great Britain, but as regards ordinary farm workers, we are informed by the Ministry of Agriculture that in the present state of agriculture in this country the natural increase of population in farming areas is in excess of the number of recruits required. We believe that, taking the country as a whole, this is substantially the case, although in some areas where there are competing industries there may be an occasional shortage of less-skilled labour. The difficulties of placing townsmen on the land would, moreover, be greatly increased by the incidence of the standard agricultural wage and by the present shortage of cottages in rural areas. There would clearly be no justification in training men from the towns if, when their training is completed, they have no reasonable prospect of securing permanent employment. As we believe that this would be the case, we are unable to reccmmend that training schemes should be adopted for training adults with a &quot;view to employment in Great Britain. For the reasons set out in paragraph 11 of our Report, we do, however, attach great importance to an effort being made by the Government to secure wider public support for its Oversea Settlement schemes by taking such steps as are possible for increasing facilities for settlement on the land in this country. We believe that an extension of small holdings would be of great value in this respect, and we refer again to this subject in paragraph 44. There are, we understand, throughout Great Britain many more approved applicants for small holdings from country districts than can at present be provided for. Training should not be necessary in such cases. If the Government were to include men drawn from the towns, who were otherwise qualified, it would be clearly necessary to accompany it with a preliminary training. This training should, in our view, be carried out in training centres established for the purpose, conducted on lines substantially the same as those adopted by the Ministry of Labour at its existing training centres for oversea settlement. We are convinced that this method of training, giving, as it does, a disciplined and regular life to the trainees, would be preferable to a system of placing them for instruction with individual farmers.(b.) Training for Oversea Settlement.19. The Government have already approved as an experimental measure the establishment by the Ministry of Labour of two training centres for single men between 18 and 25, with a view to fitting them for Oversea Settlcmeri&quot;. The results so far achieved both here and at Catterick are most encouraging. In particular, it is a matter for satisfaction that the Dominion representatives who have \isited these centres have so far modified their previous opinion on the subject of training in this country as warmty to acknowledge the value of the instruction that is being given. We are informed by the Oversea Settlement Department that the Dominion Governments are prepared to accept as farm workers, adults taken from the towns who pass satisfactorily through these Centres. Indeed, the Canadian Government, who are at present attracting more settlers from the Continent than from the United Kingdom, are actually pressing for large numbers of men from this country who have undergone a short preliminary training.   The Director of
European Migration for Canada has asked for 5,000 such men next year, and has expressed the opinion that in following years this number might be very largely increased. There is, therefore, in this case a reasonable prospect that after training men may find themselves with assured employment. The experience of the Ministry of Labour shows that a flow of suitable candidates for training can be obtained from the large towns.20. In paragraph 18 we have expressed the view that any training provided by the Government for adults for employment in Great Britain should be given at special centres and not with individual farmers. The same considerations apply with even greater force to the case of men being trained for oversea settlement. In their case the time-table is an important factor. Definite posts have to be found for them overseas; shipping accommodation has to be reserved in advance at fixed dates, and the training has to be arranged to fit in with the dates of sailing, and so as to save the men from any interval of idleness after the end of the training course, especially as many of them have no means of subsistence. A training centre can work to a time-table and adapt its curriculum, if necessary, so that it is covered by a definite date. This is very difficult for a private farmer. Moreover, on a private farm training must necessarily be subordinated to the needs of the farm&apos;s ordinary work; at the training centre training is the first consideration. It is also not a simple task to give efficient training in a short time; it involves careful planning and capable instructors, and there is no reason why the individual farmer, however expert at farming, should be expected also to be expert at training. Any system of placing men out with farmers would entail systematic supervision, which would be expensive to the State and might well be irritating to the farmer, and would probably involve the payment of a fee to the farmer and difficult questions as to the rates of payment to the trainees. It is very doubtful whether farmers would be willing to take trainees in any numbers under these conditions. We consider, there-fore, that the training of adults for overseas must be carried out at training centres.21. As regards the numbers to be trained, we feel that the question is so intimately bound up with that of the provision of funds that we put forward our specific proposals on this head in paragraphs 51 and 52. On the general question of training of adults we submit the following recommendations :- (a.) That there should be largely increased provision for training of adults fromthe towns for oversea settlement. (b.) That the training so provided should be carried out at training centresspecially established for the purpose.V. Training Schemes for Boys.(a.) Training for Employment in Great Britain.22. As in the case of adults, the main difficulty in the way of training juveniles from the towns for employment on the laud in this country is that of securing employ-ment for them after their training has been completed. British agriculture is, in general, able itself to make good the normal wastage, and it is difficult to find vacancies on the land for boys from the towns. We are satisfied, however, that it is possible to do this, but only for a small number. For many years a number of boys have been placed annually with farmers both from the Poor Law Schools and from the Industrial and Reformatory Schools. Many of the former class of boy, and some of the latter, have done well on the land, and, on the whole, the system has justified itself. Work of this kind has, moreover, been carried on with marked success by a number of voluntary agencies, especially in Scotland, but its volume in England and Wales has decreased in recent years. We hesitate to dogmatise on a question of this kind, but there appear to be grounds for thinking that the placing on the land of juveniles from the towns can be as well done, and probably better done, by voluntary agencies than it could be by the State. The period from 14 to 18 is, even for the most fortunate boys, one of physical, and often of moral, difficulty. These difficulties, and indeed dangers, are greatly accentuated m the case of boys drawn from the poorest homes in the great cities, unused as most of them are to any form of parental discipline. The handling of such difficult material can, we believe, be left in the hands of voluntary agencies, and they should be encouraged undertake this work. The State can, and does, give such boys an adequate training, but when the training is completed, the State, we believe, is less well equipped than are efficient voluntary organisations for placing boys in employment.
Voluntary agencies are better able to give boys the individual care and attention which their needs require after they are placed in employment. They claim, more-over, that such success as they have attained is largely due to the moral and religious instruction that they give to the boys that come under their care. &amp;23. The field for training town boys, other than those from the fore^oin^ schools, for employment in this country is not large, but within narrow limits valuable work is being done by voluntary agencies. We believe that, on the whole it would be better for this work to be carried on in the future by the same means&apos; and we think that, where recognised agencies find difficulty for financial reasons in doing so, the State would be well advised in assisting them with small money grants.24.   We therefore recommend-(a.) That, owing to the difficulty of securing suitable employment, the state would not be justified in instituting training centres for town boysintending to remain in this country. (b.) That this class of training could better be afforded through the medium of voluntary agencies, which should be encouraged in this work by thepayment of a small Government grant.(b.) Training for Oversea Settlement.25. The training of juveniles from the towns for oversea settlement has received a large share of the attention of voluntary agencies, and it is in this field that they have achieved their most striking successes. This training has in some instances been given at Centres established for the purpose, and in Scotland also, by the placing of boys for instruction with carefully selected farmers. We are anxious that no recommendation of ours should prejudice the valuable work now being carried on by these voluntary agencies, but we think that the difficulties in placing boys with farmers for training are such as to render it unsuitable for adoption as part of a State system of training of juveniles for overseas. We recommend that grants from public funds should, as in the past, be made in aid of this class of training to voluntary agencies where the Oversea Settlement Department is satisfied with the standard of training given. In general, however, we think that the training of boys from the towns for oversea settlement should be carried out at special centres pro-vided either directly by the Government or through recognised voluntary agencies. The importance of the factor of time and the necessity of completing training courses by a given date to enable adequate arrangements to be made with the shipping companies and with the Dominion Governments are, in our view, such as to render this the only possible conclusion.26.   We therefore recommend (a.) That agricultural training of town boys for oversea settlement should be carried out at special centres provided either directly by the Government or through recognised voluntary agencies.(b.) That owing to the practical difficulties involved the State should not attempt to place out boys with farmers for instruction, but that grants might be made from public funds in exceptional cases to recognised voluntary agencies for this class of training.(c.) Child Migration.27. Canada is the only Dominion in which hitherto child migration has been a practical problem, and tliis question was considered with others by the Oversea Settlement Delegation to Canada in 1924, whose Report has been presented to Parliament (Chid. 2285). The Delegation recommended that juvenile migration should be restricted to children of 14 and over. The reasons on which this reconi-mendation was based include the difficulty of gauging the temperament of young children for migration, and of ascertaining their suitability for life overseas, tne schooling difficulty, and the attitude of important sections of Canadian opinion. Child migration is, in any case, a highly controversial subject. Some organisations in this country do not share the view that children should not proceed overseas until after reaching school-leaving age, while others warmly support the Canadian view. On the whole, we see no ground for dissenting from the conclusions readied in the Report, but many of the objections to child migration would, m our view De obviated if philanthropic institutions, such as Barnardo Homes, were to institute in the Dominions, for children from this country, special training homes with educational facilities.
VI.-Training Centres for Oversea Settlement.(a.) Character and Duration of Training.28. The character of the instruction to be given must necessarily determine to a large extent the organisation to be adopted at the training centres and their cost. There are three types, any one of which could be adopted for adults: (i.) A Complete Course of Agricultural Training.Such a scheme would involve a long and costly period of training, and would, moreover, not be viewed with favour by the Dominion authorities.(ii.) General Training in Elementary Agricultural Work.This is the basis on which the Ministry of Labour have sought to run their existing centres at Clay don and Brandon. No pretension is made at giving a complete education in agriculture, but an attempt is made to teach as much as is practicable of certain skilled processes with which the agricultural worker has to be acquainted; to show those under training something of the conditions of life and work on the land; and to improve their physique and morale and to eliminate the unsuitable.(iii.) A Brief Course of Preliminary Testing.If this policy were adopted, the object of the course would mainly be to eliminate those who physically, or temperamentally, appeared unsuitable, training as such being left to be carried out in the Dominions.29. The length of the present course at the Ministry of Labour centres is six months, and the minimum to which they would be prepared at present to reduce it is four months. In their view, it is not at present possible in a shorter period to get adult trainees from the towns up to the standards required by the Dominions. Experience has shown that the fourth month is of the greatest value, not only in enabling trainees to consolidate the gains of the previous three months, but in effecting a marked superiority of physical condition as compared with that obtained after three months&apos; training. - The latter considerations are of particular importance in the case of men going to Australia, where there is a great danger of loss of health and morale during the long sea passage, when arrangements should be made for organised games and instruction in physical exercises. In view of the success of the present system, we recommend that training schemes should continue to be administered by the Ministry of Labour. We consider it is important that the closest possible touch should be kept between the Ministry and the Oversea Settlement Department of the Dominions Office, and we suggest that to this end the Director of Training at the Ministry of Labour should be added as a member of the Oversea Settlement Committee. As regards the duration of new schemes, we think that courses should, in the first instance, be fixed at not less than four months. We think, however, that the position should be reviewed from time to time, as when greater experience has been gained it may be possible still further to reduce the period of training without detriment to its value. Clearly, this would be desirable, if it is found possible, as this would at the same time reduce the cost per head of training and increase the number of trainees that could pass through each centre in the course of a year. Some individual trainees will naturally develop more rapidly than others, and we think it desirable, therefore, that a considerable measure of discretion should be left to the managers of centres as to the length of the course in particular cases.30. In considering this question, we have assumed that training centres would be administered directly by the responsible Government Department, or in favourable circumstances by approved voluntary agencies under Government supervision.31.   We therefore recommend (i.) That training should be undertaken directly by the Government through the Ministry of Labour, or in favourable circumstances by approved voluntary agencies under Government supervision.(ii.) That, in the first instance, training should consist of a four months&apos; course, but that the position should be reviewed from time to time to see whether it would be possible to reduce the period of training without detriment to its efficiency.)
(iii.) That, in order to secure the closest co-operation between the Ministry of Labour and the Dominions Office, the Director of Training at the Ministry should be appointed a member of the Oversea Settlement Committee.32. In general, these recommendations apply both to adults and juveniles, but in the case of the latter certain modifications in the duration and nature of the training will be necessary. . 0(b.) Curriculum.33. The general arrangement of the main subjects taught at the Ministry of Labour centres is as follows: (i.) Milking and the care of cows, (ii.) Ploughing and the care of horses.(iii.) General farm work, including some familiarity with the types of implementin use in the Dominions, (iv.) The use of tools, (v.) Lectures on life in the Dominions, and elementary general instruction in such subjects as practical arithmetic.This curriculum corresponds closely with that recommended by the Oversea Settle-ment Committee in their Report for 1925 (Cmd. 2640), except that in the latter are specifically included also the erection and repair of fences and hutments; rough carpentry, smithy work and repair of farm implements and motor cars; and the repair of boots, harness and clothes. We consider that these curricula substantially meet general requirements, but we would again emphasise our view that rigid uniformity should not be insisted upon in every case, a certain latitude being allowed to meet the capacity of individual pupils and the facilities available at particular centres.(c.) Training of Staff.34. In view of the modest character of the existing Government training schemes, the Ministry of Labour have not experienced any difficulty in obtaining either suitable Managers or efficient instructors for their centres. In the event of an expansion being approved, the Ministry would in the first instance draw on their existing staff for the chief posts in the new centres. If, however, a considerable number of new centres were to be established, special arrangements for the training of instructors would be necessary. On former occasions the Board of Education have organised courses for training instructors for the Ministry of Labour, but, since the training in this case must be in agricultural practice, it might usefully be undertaken by the Agricultural Colleges with the co-operation of the two Depart-ments of Agriculture.(d.) Situation of Centres.35. In considering the selection of a site for the establishment of a centre, regard must be had not only to the area of suitable land available, but to its.proximity to railways and other transport facilities. If the maximum number of pupils are to pass through in the course of the year, the soil should be capable of being easily worked in the winter and the&quot; neighbourhood should possess an equable climate free in the winter either from excessive rain or heavy snowfalls, which would prevent continuous instruction on the farms. If the Government were to decide to start extensive land settlement or reclamation schemes, it would be a matter for consideration whether some of the centres to be established should be situated on reclaimable land so that the trainees could assist in the work of reclamation during their period of instruction.VIL-After-Care.36. We have been much impressed in the course of our enquiry by the importance of securing adequate arrangements for the after-care and supervision of trainees. We believe that this is as important in the case of persons trained tor employment on the land in Great Britain as it is for those proceeding overseas.
37. As regards juveniles trained for employment in this country, the evidence of the voluntary agencies concerned is unanimous in claiming that-, other things being equal, the proportion of successes to failures among their pupils largely turns on the adequacy of supervision after they have been placed in employment. The value of continued sympathetic supervision is strikingly shown by the experience of the Southwark Boys&apos; Aid Association, in regard to which particulars have been submitted to us. Such supervision can undoubtedly be more effectively organised by voluntary agencies than by the State, and this fact strengthens our view expressed in paragraph 22 that the training of juveniles for employment in this country should continue to be afforded through the medium of voluntary agencies.38. The. Oversea Settlement Department have devoted much care and thought to the question of after-care for all persons proceeding overseas. They consider that while there is room for improvement, the arrangements which have been made for supervision in the Dominions are on the whole as good as local circumstances permit. While we do not wish to trench on the functions of the Oversea Settlement Committee, we would strongly urge that this side of their work should be extended and strengthened as much as possible. We think that closer relations could usefully be developed between the Dominions Office and those actually charged with the duty of supervision. In this connection we welcome the recent appointment in Australia of a direct representative of the Dominions Office. We believe that the establish-ment of personal relations between officers of the Mother Country and the Dominion Governments will do much to strengthen the human side of the work of oversea settlement. As regards Canada, the Dominions Office are on the whole satisfied with the after-care arrangements of the Dominion Government, but we think that substantial improvements would be effected by the appointment in Canada, as in Australia, of a direct representative of the Dominions Office.39. There is one other question to which we desire to draw attention in this connection. The Canadian Passage Agreement at present in force entails the finding by settlers going to Canada of a certain amount of money for railway fares in this country, for the balance of the assisted passage and for food and incidentals on the land journey overseas. Most of the Ministry of Labour trainees do not possess this money, and the Ministry have found it necessary to provide it in order that the money spent on training might not be thrown away. Men going to Australia are not under the same disability, since they can obtain the necessary money on loan. The arrangements with the Canadian Government do not countenance such loans to single men. It is contrary to the spirit of the Empire Settlement Act that the Imperial Government should continue to bear the whole of this charge. At present, the cost of the Ministry of Labour Training Schemes, being regarded still as .in the experimental stage, is charged to the Vote for the Relief of Unemployment and is borne wholly by the British taxpayer. We refer to this matter again in para-graphs 54 to 56, and we think that the expenditure now in question should in the same way be discussed with the Canadian Government at the Imperial Conference, or whenever the Canadian Passage Agreement comes up for revision. Where a loan system is adopted, it is important, if failures are to be avoided, that trainees should not be asked to shoulder too heavy a burden of debt to be repaid out of their subsequent earnings.VIII. Technical Agricultural Trades.40. In connection with the training of adults for employment in Great Britain, we have considered whether it would be possible to train a limited number of agricultural tradesmen, such as wheelwrights and blacksmiths. Training in these trades is being closely watched by the Rural Industries Intelligence Bureau, and their experience has shown that notwithstanding the fact that the demand for skilled men exceeds the supply, the prospect of finding employment in these trades for men brought up in the towns is very slight. The Bureau believes that it is possible to train country-bred men who would naturally return to their own areas, but that it would not be possible to secure any guarantee of employment for a townsman so trained who might subsequently settle in a country district.41.   We therefore recommend That no expenditure would be justified on a scheme for training persons from urban areas for technical agricultural trades. [14870] c
IX. Land Settlement.(a.) Settlement of Displaced Miners.42. Our terms of reference are limited to advising on schemes of training for &quot;employment &quot; in agriculture. For the reasons explained in paragraph 18 of this Report -we cannot recommend as likely to be successful any scheme for the training of adults from urban areas for employment on the land in this country. Such vacancies as occur are readily filled by country persons, and in so far as there may be local shortages, other than seasonal, of agricultural labour in some areas, we are satisfied that the position can be better met by the training cf juveniles from the towns than by the training of adults. It has been suggested that some scheme should be submitted by which a proportion of the miners who will be permanently displaced from their occupation will be enabled to earn a livelihocd on the land. We have no doubt that as a class miners are well suited for agricultural pursuits. It is common knowledge that as small holders they show considerable aptitude. The success of the evening gardening classes in the mining districts of Staffordshire and elsewhere indicates that as a class they appreciate and take full advantage of any special facilities afforded them. Although it is difficult to obtain precise information, we have reason to believe that in agricultural districts adjoining mining areas a certain number of country-bred men do seek employment in the mines. If this is so, there is in existence a nucleus among the mining population fitted by experience for work on the land. That many miners realise that they must seek new employment and are considering the possibility cf work on the land is shown by the comparatively large numbers that are now applying fcr oversea settlement. The restrictions imposed by the Dominion Governments on the migration of classes ether than agricultural labourers have, however, resulted in the great majority of these applications being refused. We do not doubt that many of these applicants would have been approved, if they had undergone a preliminary training in agriculture such as we recommend. In so far as displaced miners decide to seek a career on the land, they will, no doubt, in the main proceed overseas. We desire, however, to emphasise in this connection the significance of the psychological factor to which we have already referred in paragraph 11. We believe that it is peculiarly important in this case, in view of the feeling of disappointment and suspicion inevitably engendered in a great economic crisis. We strongly recommend, therefore, that in addition to the grant of facilities for oversea settlement, special arrangements should be made by the Government to enable miners permanently displaced to become small holders in this country. In our view the exceptional difficulties with which the mining population is faced are fully sufficient to justify the Government in granting to displaced miners facilities in this regard in addition to those offered to other classes of the community. His Majesty&apos;s Government propose, we understand, to earmark the sum of approximately  3,000,000 for assistance to the mining industry, and we suggest that expenditure on a scheme such as we propose would form a proper charge on this fund.43.   Our recommendations on this part of our subject are therefore as fellows: (i.) That training should be provided for miners, permanently displaced from employment on account of the crisis in the coal industry, (a) for oversea settlement, and (6) as small holders in this country, (ii.) That training of miners for (i) (&amp;) above, although in the first instance undertaken on a modest scale, should be regarded as an integral part of any scheme for dealing with the settlement of displaced miners, (iii.) That special financial provision for the settlement of miners in this country, recommended above, should be made in addition to any sums that may be available for existing or contemplated schemes of a general character forland settlement in Great Britain.(b.) Land Settlement.44. In the foregoing paragraph we have suggested that the Government should approve a special programme of land settlement in this country for the assistance of miners permanently displaced from the coal industry. We feel precluded by our terms of reference from considering the wider aspects of land settlement; but we desire to draw attention to the fact that if the Government were to decide to embark on a considerable land-settlement programme in this country, the difficulties that at present make it impossible for us to recommend the training of adults from
the towns for work on the land in Great Britain would disappear. A scheme for providing small holdings for men drawn from the towns to whom a course of training had been given would, in our view, be fruitful of valuable results.X. Training Schemes for Women and Girls. (a.) Single Women.45. The possibility of devising satisfactory schemes for training women and girls for work on the land is not expressly included in our terms of reference; but we have thought that a survey of the problem referred to us would be incomplete if we were to exclude it from our enquiry.46. So far as training for employment in this country is concerned, we are satisfied that the objections are even more cogent in the case of women and girls than in the case of adults (men) from the towns.47. The opportunities of finding suitable employment at home for women and girls after training would be so slight that we feel unable to submit any recommenda-tion for training in this field. As regards training for life overseas, we have received a valuable report from Miss Gladys Pott, the Executive Officer of the Society for Oversea Settlement of British women, which we attach as an Appendix. We are in substantial agreement with Miss Potfs views, but we do not offer at this stage any observations on the financial considerations that would be involved.(b.) Female Dependents of Trainees for Oversea Settlement.48. The Ministry of Labour scheme of training is at present limited to single men. If in the future it is extended to include married men, there would be strong grounds for providing training for their wives and other female dependents. Muck of their chances of making good in the Dominions will depend on the extent to which their wives assist or hinder them in their new life. The importance of this factor was clearly realised by the Canadian Government, who included in the Khaki University for Canadian soldiers awaiting resettlement in civil life provision for the training of wives and other female dependents. This course was carried out through the London County Council and included home organisation, infant care, nursing, laundry, dairying, poultry-farming, gardening, dress-making and health. Such a course, conducted through tihe agency of local authorities, would give women an opportunity of gaining some knowledge of Dominion methods and, in particular, would be helpful in familiarising them with Dominion types of utensils, e.g., of stoves, which often differ essentially from those in use in this country, thus removing one real domestic difficulty with which otherwise they would be faced in their new life. Schemes for training women on these lines have also been developed in Belgium with striking success. It would not, in our view, probably be necessary- to adopt so elaborate a curriculum as that attempted by the Khaki University or by the Belgian schools, but we believe that a valuable course could be devised comprising instruction not only in elementary agricultural work, but also in house-keeping and plain cooking. Such a course held during the period in which the husbands were being trained would, in our view, form a valuable adjunct to existing schemes for oversea settlement.49. We realise that, before such a scheme could be put into operation, consider-able administrative difficulties would have to be overcome. It would be necessary, in the first place, to decide whether training should be carried out at centres. If so, special arrangements would have to be made in the case of married women with children, who would have to be looked after while their mother was under training. Difficulty might also arise where husbands and wives were both under training, and where one or other failed on completion of training to secure the approval of the Dominion authorities. As regards the cost of training women, it requires much closer study than we have been able to give to the subject to estimate the expenditure that would be involved. In spite of these difficulties, we consider that the problem is one that will have to be faced if training schemes for men are to be successful.50.   We therefore recommend That where men with wives and other female dependents are accepted for training for oversea settlement, provision should be made for courses of instruction to be given in (a) housekeeping under Dominion conditions and plain cooking, and (b) simple agricultural work.[14870] * c 2
XI. Financial Recommendations. (a.) Cost of Training Schemes.(i.) Schemes directly Undertaken by the Government.51. The Ministry of Labour estimate that the initial cost of acquiring and equipping a new training centre capable of accommodating 350 unmarried men for oversea settlement may be taken on the average as not less than  50,000. This figure is based on the assumption that it would be possible to buy a sufficient area of suitable land, conveniently situated as to railways, with a large country house equipped with light and water. Tlie cost of taking bare land and providing necessary buildings, even of a temporary character, water, light, sewage and other services, would be substantially greater. On the understanding that training would be reduced from the present period of six to a period of four months, the running costs are estimated at  40 to  44 per head. A centre of this size would be capable of training 1,000 persons per annum, provided that the site was carefully selected in a part of the country where the soil and climate render it possible to carry on training uninterruptedly throughout the year. On this basis, the annual running costs of such a centre would amount to about  42,000.52. The Oversea Settlement Department have strongly urged that arrangements should be made as soon as possible for the training and accommodation by the Government in this country of a minimum of 10,000 persons (adults and juveniles) per annum for oversea settlement, in addition to the numbers at present being trained on an experimental basis at Claydon and Brandon and through voluntary agencies. They urge that this figure should be regarded as a minimum, and they hope that the number will rise rapidly. If this policy is adopted by His Majesty&apos;s Government, it will be necessary to acquire and maintain a minimum of ten additional training centres. On the further assumption that the whole cost is met from public funds, the liability so assumed would roughly be as follows :   Initial capital expenditure for acquiring and equippingten training centres at  50,000 ... ... 500,000Running expenses of ten training centres     ...      (say) 420,000It is apparent that it will not be possible to attain a programme of this size for one or two years, and the cost of the scheme in the meanwhile will be substantially less than the foregoing figures. It would be possible further to reduce the cost of the scheme if it were decided to institute in certain cases short periods of testing rather than training.   We recommend That arrangements should be made as soon as possible for the training and accommodation of a minimum of 10,000 additional persons, adult and juvenile, per annum for oversea settlement, at an estimated capital cost of  500,000 (i.e.,  50,000 per centre), and a recurrent annual expenditure of  420,000 (i.e.,  42,000 per centre).(ii.) Voluntary Organisations.53. In Paragraphs 25 and 26 of our Report, we have recommended that in certain cases the agricultural training of town boys for oversea settlement should be provided bv the Government through recognised voluntary agencies, on the lines of the existing practice of the Oversea Settlement Department. The total cost of training 10,000 persons estimated above might be slightly reduced if, so -far as juveniles are concerned, considerable advantage is taken of voluntary agencies, and &quot;if the grant payable for them were less than the cost of training them at a Govern-ment centre......(b.) Incidence of Cost.54. As regards the incidence of cost, a difficulty arises. We should normally recommend that the cost of training should be defrayed from the provision available under the Empire Settlement Act. But under that Act not more than half the cost of any scheme may be borne by the Government of Great Britain, and training ifa explicitly mentioned in the Act as a matter to be provided for under a statutory
scheme. Hitherto, however, the Dominions have refused to bear any part of the cost of training in this country of settlers for overseas. If the attitude of the . Dominions is maintained the training cannot be financed under the Empire Settle-ment Act. It has been suggested to us that money might be made available in the Dominions Office Estimates beginning in 1927, without employing the Funds \ provided under the Act. But we are informed that the Treasury could not agree to t any such provision in the Dominions Office Estimates, for this would have the effect : of overriding by administrative action the intention of an Act of Parliament.55. We would urge, therefore, that a further attempt be made to persuade the I Dominions to contribute to the cost of training, and thereby set free the money which would then be available under the Empire Settlement Act. And we suggest that J the full circumstances should be discussed, and the appeal made, at the Imperial Conference. If the appeal fails, it will be for the Cabinet to decide whether a case has been made out for imposing the whole cost of the training on the British tax-payer, and whether Parliamentary sanction should be obtained for the purpose. Legislation would, of course, take time, and if the Cabinet accept our considered opinion that the provision for oversea training should be extended, an immediate addition to the present experimental organisation under the Ministry of Labour is required.56. We would add that, against our estimated figure of  420,000 for training 10,000 persons, must be set a large saving both to the Unemployment Fund and +0 the local rates.XII. Summary of Recommendations.57. We submit, for the information of the Committee of Civil Research, the following summary of our principal recommendations : (1.) As regards the training of adults for oversea settlement (a.) That there should be largely increased provision for training ofadults from the towns for oversea settlement. (&amp;.) That the training so provided should be carried out at trainingcentres specially established for the purpose.(2.) As regards the training of juveniles for employment in Great Britain (a.) That, owing to the difficulty of securing suitable employment, the State would not be justified in instituting training centres for town boys intending to remain in this country.(&amp;.) That this class of training could better be afforded through the medium of voluntary agencies which should be encouraged in this work by the payment of a small Government grant.(3.) As regards the training of juveniles for oversea settlement (a.) That agricultural training of town boys for oversea settlement should be carried out at special centres provided either directly by the Government or through recognised voluntary agencies. (&amp;.) That owing to the practical difficulties involved, the State should not attempt to place out boys with farmers for instruction, but that grants might be made from public funds in exceptional cases to recognised voluntary agencies for this class of training.(4.) As regards the character of training centres for oversea settlement (a.) That training should be undertaken directly by the government through the Ministry of Labour, or in favourable circumstances by .approved voluntary agencies under Government supervision. (p.) That in the first instance training should consist of a four months&apos;course, but that the position should be reviewed from time to timeto see whether it would be possible to reduce the period of trainingwithout detriment to its efficiency, (c.) That in order to secure the closest co-operation between the Ministryof Labour and the Dominions Office, the Director of Training atthe Ministry should be appointed a member of the oversea settlement Committee.
(5.) As regards miners permanently displaced from the coal industry (a.) That training should be provided for miners, permanently displaced from employment on account of the crisis in the coal industry (i) for oversea settlement, and (ii) as small holders in this country &apos; (&amp;.) That training of miners for (a) (ii) above, although in the first instance undertaken on a modest scale, should be regarded as an integral part of any scheme for dealing with the settlement of displaced miners.(c.) That special financial provision for the settlement of miners in this country, recommended above, should be made in addition to any sums that may be available for existing or contemplated schemes of a general character for land settlement in Great Britain.(6.) As regards the training of women That where men with wives and other female dependents are accepted for training for oversea settlement, provision should be made for courses of instruction to be given in (a) housekeeping under Dominion conditions - and plain cooking, and (b) simple agricultural work.(7.) As regards the numbers to be trained-That arrangements should be made as soon as possible for the training and accommodation of a minimum of 10,000 additional persons, adult and juvenile, per annum for oversea settlement, at an estimated capital cost of  500,000 (i.e.,  50,000 per centre), and a recurrent annual expenditure of  420,000 (i.e.,  42,000 per centre).Note. This recommendation is subject to the general considerations set out in paragraphs 54 to 56 in regard to Finance.Signed on behalf of the Sub-Committee,BLEDISLOE, Chairman.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1, July 23, 1926.
APPENDIX.Memorandum by Miss Gladys Pott.(a.) Wives and Dependents of Men selected for Overseas.Most competent authorities agree in the view that the ultimate success or failure of a married man who settles upon the land overseas depends as much, or even more, upon the adaptability and competence of his wife than upon the man himself. This point of view has been urged upon the Oversea Settlement Committee from many quarters, and it is noticeable that Dr. Elwood Mead, the authority upon group settlement in California,&apos; insisted that the Selection Committee, before whom applicants for small holdings had to appear, should interview the wife as wTell as the man before deciding that an application should be accepted.In the opinion of Major Stibbard and others connected with the Catterick Training Scheme, the adaptability and resourcefulness of the women were as important as the selection of the suitable men.The wives of approved settlers may sometimes have some experience not only of housework, but of agricultural work before they leave this country, but almost all must lack knowledge of the conditions in which household work is performed in the new country, and the variations in agricultural work, such as. handling of poultry, bees and milking, due to the changes of climate and surroundings, all of which are likely to fall to their lot.Some form of training, therefore, for married women, fiancees and those going to join brothers or other relations overseas should be provided in this country. Practical lessons in the management of the kind of kitchen stove and fuel that is likely to be used and in adaptation of simple and rough utensils and furniture to the needs of household life would appear to be the type of training most desirable.It would appear not impossible to arrange such special course at one of the many existing centres for training, such as experimental farms or farming institutes scattered throughout the country. There would be undoubtedly a good many difficulties to surmount, but if the principle of provision of training were once accepted by Government Authorities, obstacles might then be overcome and an official scheme put into being.(b.) Single Women.It is not possible to treat the subject of training without some mention of the need of the single woman. The Dominions Royal Commission urged upon the notice of the British Government the desirability of the migration of an equal number of males and females from the United Kingdom to the overseas Dominions, and pointed out special advantages in connection with the migration of younger women. The Oversea Settlement Committee since its inception has urged a similar point of view in each of their annual reports.That the migration of girls presents greater difficulties than that of boys and young men is fully realised. But the disproportion of the sexes in this country, and the fact that males are numerically in excess of females in the country districts of the Dominions render the necessity for handling the question, in spite of all difficulties most urgent.The various schemes for drafting from this country into the Dominions boys and young men of all grades of education, and the lack of schemes for finding opportunities for girls overseas increases rather than decreases as time goes on.Associations of women, and more especially of those who are interested in the broad principles of imperial migration, are constantly disappointed at the failure of the authorities to deal more efficiently with the question of women&apos;s migration. And they are more especially disappointed when they hear of public money being spent almost entirely in the direction of providing schemes of training for young men and refusal to provide an equivalent for girls and young women.The only State-aided migration available for single women to-day is for those who undertake and are able to perform efficient domestic work. The young women who go out as domestics are the potential wives of the young men who leave this country, and as such, they would&quot; appear to have some right to expect to be able to obtain the training suitable to enable them to build up as quickly as possible a home which they will own jointly with their respective husbands.
It would appear as important from the British point of view, as well as from that of the individual settler, that the potential wives should be properly trained as that the young women who are actual wives when they cross the sea should be properly equipped.The form of training that the Women&apos;s Branch of the Oversea Settlement Committee believe to be the most desirable would not consist in the establishment of special training centres for the purposes of training girls for life overseas, but the adaptation of existing courses and the provision of grants of money to be used for selected applicants to enable them to take the said courses.Recent correspondence and interviews with some of the well-known head-mistresses of large secondary schools in the north of England and with at least one local County Authority has shown the need is fully realised by the teachers of secondary school girls, and the desire to co-operate, if possible, in the provision of the necessary training is present on the part of local authorities.But some provision of funds from Government sources is essential. Local authorities can only spend local money for the benefit of local dwellers. Any scheme of training for overseas must be&quot; available for girls from all parts of the United Kingdom and for this reason some central fund would appear to be an absolute necessity.Training of the kind mentioned must be in the nature of an experiment and results in the number of women going overseas may not be apparent in the near future. The conditions of the whole case call for unprecedented effort, and unless some such effort be made it is difficult for the public to believe that the central authorities take the question of the migration of women seriously.(Signed)      GLADYS POTT.Oversea Settlement Committee, S.W. 1, July 16, 1926.
