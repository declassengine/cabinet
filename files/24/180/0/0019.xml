27th May,  1926.Dear Mr. Gosgrave,I am sorry for the delay which has occurred in replying to your letter of November 4th last on the  subject of the -Lane Pictures&apos;.     The matter was of course one which it was necessary to refer to the Cabinet, and It required careful and prolonged consideration.The report of the Wilson Committee, together with your observations thereon and other relevant papers,  including a memorandum by Lady Gregory which the High Commissioner sent to me on May 15th, have now been very fully considered by the Cabinet and we have decided that we must accept the conclusion reached by the Wilson Committee,  that it would, be improper to modify Sir Hugh Lane&apos;s will by legislation.We have, however, received, an assurance from the Trustees of the National Gallery that it is  their present intention to lend to Dublin on the expiration of 15 years from the date when the pictures came into their possession (i.e. as soon as they are empowered to do so under Section 4 of the National Gallery (Loan) Act,  1885) a substantial number of the Lane pictures from time to time,  and. for a&apos; aubstantia.1 period, whether a special Gallery has then been provided in Dublin or not.Furthermore,  if the Government of the Irish Free State are prepared to accept the above arrangement as a final settlement of the  question,  the British Government will be prepared to introduce and carry into law a Bill amending Section 4 of the Act of 1885 so as to enable the Trustees of the National Gallery to lend Lane Bequest pictures to Dublin immediately after the passage of the Bill into law,
27th May,  1926 .Dear Mr. Cosgrave,I am sorry for the delay which has occurred in replying to your letter of November 4th last on the  subject of the * Lane Pictures.     The matter was of course one which it was necessary to refer to the Cabinet, and It required, careful and. prolonged consideration.The report of the Wilson Committee,  together with, your observations thereon and other relevant papers,  Including a memorandum by Lady Gregory which the High Commissioner sent to me on May 13th, have now been very fully considered by the Cabinet and %e have decided that we must accept the conclusion reached by the Wilson Committee,   that it would, be improper to modify Sir Hugh. Lane&apos; s will by legislation.We have, however, received, an assurance from, the Trustees of the National Gallery that it is  their present intention to lend to Dublin on the expiration of 15 years from the date when the pictures came into their possession (i,e. as soon as  they are empowered to do so under Section 4 of the National Grllery (Loan) Act,  1885)  a substantial number of the Lane pictures from time to time,  and for a substantial period,  whether a special Gallery has then been provided11in Dublin or not.

We should be glad to receive your reply on this point, at a very early date.     As soon as we receive your reply, we should propose to publish the ?.;ilsoti Report, and at Dae same time to announce our decision with regard to It.In view of the statement in. paragraph 5 of your letter of November 4th that Sir Hugh Lane&apos;s Will does not beq\jeath the pictures to the National Gallery,  I think it right to add that you have perhaps overlooked the provisions of Section 3 of the National Gallery Act,  1856, which enacts that &quot;All pictures and  works of art which have already been or may hereafter be from time to time given or bequeathed to the public or to the nation, or given or bequeathed by words showing an intention that the gift or bequest should enure to or for the benefit of the public or the nation,  shall (unless the donor or testator shall have made other provision for the, care thereof) vest in and be under the care and ordering of the said trustees and director of the National Gallery1&apos;,  and also the fact that an Order of the High Court, dated May 25th,  1917,      &quot;In the matter of the Estate of Hugh Lane deceased5&apos; directed the Executors of the Will to hand over the 39 pictures in question to the Trustees of the National Gallery.      There would not appear, therefore, to be any doubt that the pictures are in fact the property of the National Gallery.
