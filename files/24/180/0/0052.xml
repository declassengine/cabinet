p.   25 2     (26nAi^imLXl^^^^-1&quot;16&quot;1 is the Pr0P rty of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]CONFIDENTIAL.[N 1725/840/38]Guide to the Soviet Government (and Kindred Institutions).Congress of Soviets of the U.S.S.R,IN theory, the supreme body in Soviet Russia is the &apos;&apos; Congress of Soviets of the I TT.S.S.R.&quot; (Union of Socialist Soviet Republics). This congress meets in Moscow for two or.three weeks about once a year (when summoned by the Central Executive Committee of the U.S.S.R.), and consists of more than 3,000 representatives from the local Soviets all over the country. It was originally conceived as a constituent assembly &quot; solemnly voicing the wishes of the workers and peasants of Russia.&quot;Central Executive Committee of the U.S.S.R.2. The Congress of Soviets elects a smaller body to act for it during the lengthy intervals between its sessions. This is called the &quot; Central Executive Committee of the U.S.S.R.&quot; (abbreviation : TS.I.K.). It has less than 400 members, and in theory is directly responsible to the Congress of Soviets of the U.S.S.R. Important State decisions, such as action vis-a-vis foreign Powers, are taken in the name of the Central Executive Committee of the U.S.S.R., and it is the body to which foreign diplomatic representatives are accredited and present their credentials. It has the. power to ratify or cancel not only decrees made by its own Presidium and decisions taken by the Council of Commissars, or by individual Commissars (see below), but also acts of the Congress of Soviets of the U.S.S.R. The Central Executive Committee of the U.S.S.R., like the larger Congress of Soviets of the U.S.S.R., does not sit permanently; it meets (when summoned by its Presidium) about three times a year, or oftener in cases of emergency.Presidium of the Central Executive CommiTtee of the U.S.S.R.3. The Central Executive Committee of the U.S.S.R. elects a smaller body of twenty-one members, the Presidium of the Central Executive Committee of the U.S.S.R., to act for it between its meetings, and this Presidium is at these times &apos;&apos;vested with supreme legislative, executive and administrative authority,&quot; subject, of course, to the concurrence at its next session of the Central Executive Committee of the U.S.S.R., to whom its Presidium is responsible.4. These, then, are the three primary bodies of Government : (1) the Union Congress, theoretically representing the whole proletariat; (ii) the (Union) Central Executive Committee, smaller and meeting more often; (iii) the (Union) Presidium of twenty-one members in permanent session.Council of the Peopled Commissars.5.   From the intermediate of these three bodies, the Central Executive Committeeof the U.S.S.R., the next step must be traced.   This Central Executive Committeeappoints ^ the various Commissars (heads of the nine Government Departments).These,^ sitting as a permanent Cabinet, compose the Council of the People&apos;s -i     Commissars of the U.S.S.R. (Sovnarkom).   In addition to the Commissars, this ;    council includes a president,* who is not himself a Commissar, and also the chairmanof the Supreme Economic Council.   The Council of Commissars of the U.S.S.R. is;responsible to the Central Executive Committee of the U.S.S.R., but with this H    reservation (cf. paragraph 2 above), its decrees have the force of law throughout thewhole country.Council of Labour and Defence.i 6.   Closely connected with the Council of Commissars of the U.S.S.R. is theCouncil of Labour and Defence (S.T.O.).   Its primary function is to &quot;maintain )evolutionary legality,&quot; but its nominal duties are numerous, and it mav best be I    described as a Cabinet Committee with wide powers.  It includes, ex officio, six of the ;    Commissars, the chairman of the Supreme Economic Council and a representative.of* The words &quot;president&quot; and &quot; chairman&quot; are synonymous in this connection.3464a    [1267 t-51   [14711] B
the All-Russian Council of Trade Unions; its president is ex officio the chairman of the Council of Commissars. Decisions and, in part, legislation on economic questions proceed from the Council of Labour and Defence.Supreme Economic Council.7.   The chairman of the Supreme Economic Council is, as has been mentioned a member of the Council of Commissars of the U.S.S.R.- The function of this council (abbreviation : V.S.N.K.) is to supervise the organisation of State, co-operative and private industry, and &quot;the economic life of the Union.&quot;   It is to all intents and purjDoses the Commissariat of Industry.8. The principal organs of the Soviet Government may now be summarised : The Congress of Soviets of the U.S.S.R., which elects the Central Executive Committee of the U.S.S.R., which in turn elects its own Presidium and appoints the Commissars; the Council of People&apos;s Commissars (and alongside it the Council of Labour and Defence).9. The general Soviet system of government is reproduced, in a modified form (as regards purely internal administration), within the boundaries of the various republics constituting the Union of Socialist Soviet Republics.10. The Soviet Government is not a truly representative one. Nominally it expresses the &quot;Dictatorship of the Proletariat,&quot; but in practice the Russian people do not elect their,rulers. The real dictators are the leaders of the Communist party. An oligarchy of the party has usurped the executive functions of Government and enforces its authority by the strictest party discipline.11. The CG^U. (Unified State Political Direction) is the most powerful instrument by which this regime is maintained. It has been evolved out of the Tsarist Secret Police, and is hated by most and feared by all in Soviet Russia. The men who direct it are nominally appointed by the Central Committee of the Communist party, but it is probable that the real control is exercised by the Politburo. It is affiliated to the Council of Commissars; its president can attend the sessions of the latter body in a consultative capacitv, and it is represented at plenary sessions of the Council of Labour and Defence. The O.G.P.U. also has its own military units, composed of picked men, and it can thus to a considerable extent relieve the authorities of reliance on the Red army.Communist Party.12. The Communist party is the only legal political party in Russia, and more than 4,000 of the most important official positions can only be held by members of the party or with the consent of the Central Committee of the party. Its full name is the &quot; All-Union Communist party (Bolshevik),&quot; and its membership has been growing since the revolution. In April 1917 it was about 80,000, and it is reported to have lecently passed the million mark. The party is predominantly proletarian in character, and its membership is regulated in accordance with the needs of the moment, drastic &quot;purges&quot; alternating Avith intensive recruiting campaigns. The towns of Moscow and Leningrad contribute numbers to the party which are disproportionately large in relation to their populations.Congress of the Communist Party.13. About once a year (or rather every fifteen or eighteen months) the party congress meets in Moscow. This congress lasts a week or two, and is a large gathering devoted to the delivery of enthusiastic speeches rather than to the transaction of serious business.Central Committee of the Party.14. During the intervals between the party congresses, control of the party is vested in a smaller body called the &apos;&apos; Central Committee of the (Ail-Union) Communist party &quot; (abbreviation : TS.K.), elected by the congress. This committee started as a body of some two score, but has steadily grown till it has now (in consequence of the additions recently made to it by the voting of the fourteenth party congress) more than sixty members and at least forty &quot; candidates.&quot;** The function of &quot; candidates &quot; is somewhat analogous to that of twelfth-man at cricket; the word has no prospective implication. Full members seem to enjoy a more secure position, but to have little muni power than candidates.
The Politburo of the Party.15. The Central Committee of the party are responsible for the election of the famous Politburo (Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist party), which with a number of other small committees does the work of the Central Committee between its plenary sessions. The Politburo is the most important institu-tion mentioned in this memorandum and deserves detailed description. It contains nine members and five candidates, namely : This small group continues without serious opposition to wield supreme power, not only over the Communist party, but over the Third International and over the Soviet Government. Its control over the Government is not officially acknowledged, but is none the less real, for &apos;&apos; instructions&apos;&apos; are sent by the Politburo to the Council of Commissars and to the Government Departments as freely as to the units of the party and of Comintern. Thus it is the Politburo, for instance, which decides the question of granting or refusing a big concession, although the concessionnaire only comes in contact with Government Departments.Central Control Commission of the Party.16. Although less important than the Politburo, several other organs of the Communist party need mention. The Central Control Commission contains 160 members (as recently re-elected by the fourteenth congress of the party); it has a Presidium of twenty-two, functioning between its plenary sessions, a secretariat of eight which is its executive organ and a partcollegium of seven members. The last named is specially responsible for investigating disloyalty (&quot;infringement of party ethics &quot;) by members of the party, both at home and abroad, and the Central Control Commission as a whole is concerned with personnel, selecting candidates for office find keeping watch on their fitness after appointment.Orgburo of the Party.17. The Orgburo of the party is appointed by a plenary session of the Central Committee of the party, and its function is described as &quot;the general guidance of organisation work.&quot; It arranges conferences, meetings, &amp;c, and prepares agenda for them. It also deals with the appointment of party workers to the more important posts.  The Orgburo contains eleven members (and five &quot; candidates &quot;).18. The secretariat of the Communist party is&quot;a small but relatively important body of five members (and two &quot; candidates&quot;), which carries out the current work of the party, both executive and organising.19. The principal component organs of the Communist party, then, are the Congress of the party, which elects the Central Committee of about 100, which in turn nominally elects the all-powerful Politburo of nine members. The Central Control Commission of 160 members deals with personnel, and the remaining routine is handled by the (much smaller) Orgburo and secretariat.The Third International.20. There remains, besides the Soviet Government and the Communist party, one more institution of primary importance in Russia the 1&apos; Third (Communist) International &quot; (abbreviation : Comintern), founded by Lenin. Unlike the first two, it contains more foreigners than Russians. The extent of its membership is problematical, for it has branches, varying in size, throughout the world. Its concern is world revolution, &apos;&apos; the creation of a World Union of Socialist Soviet Republics and the realisation of Communism.&quot; The supreme authority of Comintern is vested in the World Congress, held periodically in Moscow, and between congresses it is controlled by an Executive Committee of about 100 members (abbreviation : IKK.I.). There is also a Presidium and secretariat containing a score of members each, and various other special committees.  All these bodies contain a proportion of foreigners.Bukharin.Voroshilov.Zinoviev.Kalinin.Molotov.Eikov.Stalin (secretary).Tomski.Trotski.Kamenev (L.B.).Petrovski. Uglahov.Rudzutak. Dzerzhinski.[1267 t-5] [14711]B 2
Profintern.21., There are several other institutions centred at Moscow which do not confine their activity to Russia, and may be regarded as auxiliaries to Comintern. One of these is the Red Trades Unions International (abbreviation : Profintern). The comparative failure of the recent activities of the Third International in Europe by leason of the opposition which its extreme Communism arouses in civilised countries has resulted in the promoters of the world revolution turning to an increasing extent to the international red trades unions, as being organisations of less iconoclastic repute and of equal disruptive value through their influence with extremist minority movements among organised labour abroad. Thus the torch of revolution among industrial populations in the &quot;West may be passed on from Comintern to Profintern.Other Auxiliaries of Comintern.22. Amongst other auxiliaries of Comintern may be mentioned the Peasant International (Krestintern), which has been devoting special attention to India, Egypt and the Balkans; the Communist International of Youth (K.I.M.); the Workers&apos; International Relief (Mezhrabkom); the Sport International; and the International Organisation for Aid to Revolutionaries (M.O.P.R.) the last named doing its work in foreign countries under the guise of philanthropy.23. The inter-relationship of these three institutions the Soviet Government, the Communist party and the Third International can now be shown.24. The Communist party occupies the intermediate position, related on the one hand to the Soviet Government and on the other to the Third International. The most powerful member of the party now is its general secretary, Stalin; he is also secretary of the Politburo, first on the list of members of the Orgburo, a member of the party delegation to the Third International (see below) and also a member of the Presidium of Comintern. Stalin&apos;s influence is felt of course both in the Government and in Comintern, but in neither does he hold a high executive position, and he may therefore be pictured as placed between the two, managing primarily the affairs of the Communist party.25. In the Soviet Government the central figure is Rikov, who corresponds to a Prime Minister in holding the positions of president of the Council of Commissars and chairman of the Council of Labour and Defence. But Rikov, although principally concerned with the Government, and the official spokesman on matters of Government policy, is also a member of the Politburo of the party; more than this, he even has a place in the Third International, being a &quot;candidate&quot; member for the Presidium, and a member of the Executive Committee, of Comintern.26. Another leading figure in the Soviet Government is L. B. Kamenev, the Commissar for Home and Foreign Trade; like Rikov, he too is concerned with the party and with the Third International as well as with the Government, being a &quot;candidate&quot; for the Politburo and a member of the Executive Committee of Comintern.27. The name of Enukidze is often seen at the foot of Government decrees; he is the chief secretary of the Central Executive Committee of the U.S.S.RV and at the same time a member of the Central Control Commission of the Communist party.28. The above examples of individuals simultaneously holding office in the Government and in the party are hardly necessary to show the close contact between the two. The Communist party brought the Soviet Government into being and still absolutely controls it. Important officials of the Government are all members of the party and can scarcely avoid subordinating the interests of the country they profess to govern to their party loyalty.29. Moreover, there is organic connection between the Central Control Commis-sion of the party and a Government Commissariat called the Workers&apos; and Peasants&apos; Inspection, and these are the bodies responsible, in the party and in the Government respectively, for the supervision of personnel.Delegation of the Party to Comintern.30. On the other side, the party keeps in touch with the Third International by means of a body named the &quot;Delegation of the All-Communist Party to the Executive Committee of the Communist international.&quot; It has five members (and six &quot;candidates&quot;), the former being Zinoviev, Bukharin, Stalin, Kamenev, Rikov.31. Zinoviev is president of the Third International. He is also a member ot the Politburo of the party, but holds no position in the Soviet Government.   He is
4*reported recently to have fallen from power in his own town, Leningrad, and to have incurred the disfavour of the party, but there is no ground for assuming that his eclipse is permanent.32. There is therefore no question whatever about the connections between (a) the party and the Government, and (b) the party and Comintern. The relationship between the Government and Comintern, however, merits a further note.Connection between the Government and Comintern.33. It has been in the past, and it may still be, of value to Moscow to be able to deny connection between the Government and Comintern. For instance, the Govern-ment can give an undertaking to refrain from propaganda against a foreign Government, and can then go through the form of disclaiming responsibility for such propaganda carried out by Comintern. It is perhaps for this reason that the party have generally avoided appointing the same individual simultaneously to high executive positions both in the Government and in the Third International. (The cases of Eikov and L. B. Kamenev mentioned above form exceptions to this rule.)34. Nevertheless, it is evident that the closest union exists between the Communist party, the Soviet Government and the Third International. Soviet statesmen, when it suits them, even emphasise it, and the direct control of all three by the Politburo may be regarded as axiomatic in the study of the Soviet Union.Foreign Office, April 19, 1926.
