[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government. 1Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1926.SECRET.^-288 (26) Copy No.   % QMEMORANDUM FOR CABINET.report of royal commission on indian currency and finance.The Royal Commission on Indian Currency and Finance, which began its work in India last autumn and subsequently took evidence in London, has recently submitted its Report. Arrangements are in train with a view to the simultaneous issue of the Report in this country and India early in August. Meanwhile it has been necessary to take certain decisions as regards the immediate action that will be necessary on publication, of which I think it right to inform my colleagues. The nature of these decisions and the tenor of the main recommendations of the Report are shown in the following announcement, which it is proposed to issue concurrently with the Report; proposed announcement.&quot; The. Secretary of. State in Council and the Government of India have considered the important and comprehensive Report of the Royal Commission on Indian Currency and Finance, which is published for general information to-day.&quot; 2. The Report deals with the following main topics :  &quot; (a) The establishment of a gold standard for India ;&quot; (6) The creation of a Central Bank, its organisation and responsibilities ; &quot; (c) The ratio of the rupee to gold ;&quot; (d) The arrangements to be adopted during the period which must elapse before the Central Bank can be brought into being. &quot;3. The Commission recognise that the projects1 comprised in (a) and (6) require certain preparatory work and cannot be given effect to at once. Their recommendations on these heads demand careful study from the Government and the public before the question of legislation can be taken up, but it is necessary to indicate at once the Governments intentions as regards (c) and (d).&quot;4. After full consideration of the Report and Minute of Dissent annexed thereto, the Secretary of State in Council and the Government of India are satisfied that it is in the interests of India to adopt as the ratio of the rupee to gold the rate of Is. (id. gold, which is recommended iu the Report.&quot; .5. The Report indicates the method by which this ratio should be established in the interim period prior to the transfer of responsibility for the control of the currency to a Central Bank. The Commission have recommended a procedure for linking the rupee to gold by placing the currency authority under an obligation to buy gold and to sell gold or gold exchange at its option at appropriate prices with reference to the accepted gold parity of the rupee. The Commission are further of opinion that the obligation to maintain the value of the currency at the parity established should be embodied in statutory form.&quot;6. Recognising the importance of establishing stability of exchange on a statutory basis as soon as possible, the Government of India will lay proposals covering the matters referred to in the two immediately preceding paragraphs before the Legislature at the forthcoming session at Simla. Meanwhile, in order to remove any uncertainty, the Government of India announce, with the approval of the Secretary of State in Council, that they will take such steps as may be necessary to prevent any undue fluctuation in the exchange value of the rupee, in order to confine the movements of the exchange within the approximate upper and lower gold points as calculated on the basis of a Is. 6d. gold rupee, viz. Is. G/&apos;no. and Is. 5JcZ. respectively.&quot;It is only necessary for me to make a few comments on the heads specified in para. 2 of the announcement above.   As regards (a) and (6) and (cZ). the Commission have proposed the eventual transfer of the functions of currency control from the 1332      100   7.26
Government of India, under the authority of the Secretary of State, to a new Central Bank, which will take over from the Imperial Bank of India such central banking f auctions as it now discharges and will carry out, in addition, the other responsibilities normally associated with a Central Bank. The principal of these functions will be the control of the currency, including the note issue, and exchange. Pendino-consideration of the questions connected with the institution of a Central Bauk the rupee exchange will be maintained at the parity of Is. 6d. through the mechanism of a gold exchange standard embodied in statute. The ultimate form of standard contemplated by the Royal Commission is a gold bullion standard, differing in important respects from that now prevailing in the United Kingdom. The proposed Indian standard contemplates the following arrangements for the purchase and sale of gold bullion by the currency authority :- (1) Gold bullion to be purchased in India at parity.(2) Gold bullion to be sold in London at parity plus an addition to cover thecharges on a remittance of bullion from India.&quot;s (3) Gold bullion to be sold in India (a) when exchange is at upper gold point, at parity ;(6) when exchange is below upper gold point, at parity plus an allowance equivalent to twice the charges on a remittance of bullion.The upper and lower gold points of the rupee exchange will be set by provisions (1) and (2) above. Provision (3) is obviously not essential from the point of view of exchange stability and is probably to be regarded as a concession made by the Commission to Indian sentiment, which was strongly in favour not only of a gold standard but of a gold circulation as well. The Commission are firmly against the introduction, at present at any rate, of a gold currency which clearly would not be consistent with the scheme of a gold bullion standard they propose. The sovereign will accordingly be demonetised in India. At present, owing to the statutory ratio being 2s. as against a market rate of Is. 6d. per rupee, the sovereign does not circulate in India, though it is a legal tender. The object of the differentiation between the currency authority^ buying and selling prices for gold in India is to protect it from the risk of a drain on its gold resources through being called upon to supply the demands of the bazaar, which, as is well known, on occasion are very considerable. If a Central Bank is constituted as proposed, it will doubtless endeavour, by its currency and exchange policy, to confine the call on its gold assets to their proper and primary use, viz. that of securing the external stability of the rupee. The expectation is that the bazaar demand for gold will continue to be supplied through the bullion market. As local token currency, viz. rupees and notes, are not to be convertible into gold coin and as gold bullion will only be obtainable from the Currency authority at what will normally be a disadvantageous price, it is not anticipated that the proposals of the Commission will involve any increased demand by the Indian public for gold. The Currency authority will, however, have to maintain gold reserves somewhat greater than would have been necessary had a gold exchange standard been adopted as a permanency. The additional gold will, if the scheme is adopted, be acquired gradually as circumstances prove favourable.As regards (c), the ratio of the rupee to gold, the Commission, with one dissentient, have agreed in recommending Is. 6cL (gold), which has been the de facto rate for some time. The dissenting member recommends Is. A-d. (gold), the pre-war ratio. As will be seen from the proposed announcement, my Council and the Government of India are in agreement in holding that the future permanent rating should be Is. 6d. gold.The Commission contemplate that the whole of the cash balances of the Government of India, including those of the Secretary of State, shoidd be centralised in the hands of the Reserve Bank. This will eventually involve an amendment of the Government of India Act, which requires the Secretary of State in Council to maintain an account at the Bank of England.It is hoped that the Report will be published on or soon after 3rd August, and until that date I would ask my colleagues to treat the information given above as very confidential.BIBKENHEAD.India Office,24th July 1926.;-* In. practice what the Central Bauk will sell will not be gold but sterling, now synonymous with gold.
