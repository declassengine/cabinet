Civil Research under the Chairmanship of the Minister of Labour,      The Committee reported in April substantially in favour of giving effect to all of them, but their report has not yet been considered by the Cabinet  (CP.  141 (26)).      The responsibility for taking action on these recommendations, when approved, restsprimarily with the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (Nose  1 &amp; 2) and with the Committee of Civil Research (No.?).Memorandum by the Secretary for Mines,Note:The recommendations set out below are in the order in which they appear in the ReportsCHAPTER III    -    UTILISATION OF COAL.
CHAPTER IV - RESEARCH 4, THAT TEE) RESEARCH ORGANISATION OF THS COLLIERY OWNERSSHOULD m EXPAND WITH INCREASED FUNDS PROVIDED partly by THE OWNERS AND PARTLY BY TIE  DEPARTMENT OF SCIENTIFICAID INDUSTRIAL RE SEARCH, 5. THAT THE WORK OF THE Fij;eiL RESEARCH DIVISION OF THEDEPARTMENT OF SCIENTIFIC AND INDUSTRIAL RESEARCH SHOULDBE PRESSED FORWARD AND PROVIDED WITH AMPLE FUNDS . 6. THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF SCIENTIFIC AND INDUSTRIAL research should BE MADE RESPONSIBLE FOR CO-ORDINATING THE various branches OF RESEARCH WORK,These recommendations are also dealt with in the Reportof the Committee of Civil Research and here also administrative action rests with the Department of Scientific and industrial research,CHAPTER V.  - STRUCTURE OF THE INDUSTRY 7,a THAT LEGISLATION SHOULD BE PASSED TO FACILITATE DESIRABLE AMALGAMATIONS .This is dealt with in the Mining Industry Bill. 8o THAT LEGISLATION SHOULD BE PASSED GIVING THE MINES DEPARTMENT POWER&quot;AFTER A PERIOD OF THREE YEARS TO IMPOSE COMPULSORY AMALGAMATIONS.The Prime. Minister announced in his speech on the 15th June thatthis would he done,  hut it was subsequently decided to omit this provision from the Bill.   As introduced it merely requires the Mines Department to make a Report to Parliament at the end of three years.CHAPTER VII      ROYALTIES. 9. THAT COAL ROYALTIES SHOULD BE ACQUIRED BY THE STATE.It is not proposed to proceed with this at present (see CabinsS. 41(26) Conclusion (g).
CHAPTER VIII  - DISTRIBUTION10.    THAT LOCAL AUTHORITIES SHOULD BE EMPOWERED TO TRADE IN COAL.The form of legislation to be adopted for this purpose was referred to- a Cabinet Sub-Committee who reported before the end of April (appendix to.C.P.122 (26)) . This Report is to be considered by the Cabinet Coal Committee on Thursday,  June 24th,    The Secretary of State for War has instructed the Parliamentary Draftsman to draft legislation on the lines of the Sub-Committee &apos; s Report with a view to the question being considered whether it should be inserted in the Mining Industry Bill at Committee stage.11,    THAT  &quot;COLLIERIES WOULD BE WELL ADVISED TO ESTABLISH C 0 - OPE R A-1 YE SELLING ASSOCIATIONS&quot;.The Government have undertaken to set up a Committee on this subject.   Proposals as to personnel and terms of reference will be submitted in due course,  but it is desirable that further consultation should take place with representatives of the Industry before this is done.12.    THAT THE QUESTION SHOttL.3 BE EXPLORED OP ESTABLISHING AN OFFICIAL SYSTEM POR THE SAMPLING AND ANALYSIS OP COAL,Before anything can be done in this direction,  long and difficult discussion with our own traders and foreign importers will be necessary and clearly this cannot usefully be initiated at present.CHAPTER IX - CONVEYANCE OP COAL.13.    THAT A JOINT COMMITTEE&apos; OP THE MINISTRY OP transport and THE MINES LEPARTMiiNT SHOULD BE APPOINTED IN ORDER TODO WHAT IS POSSIBLE TO EPPBCT A GREATER MEASURE OPSTANDARDISATION OP WAGONS;    AN INCREASED PROVISION OPWAGONS OP LARGER CAPACITY,  AND AN EXTENSION OP THEPRINCIPLE OP COMMON USER.Thi3 has been discussed between the Ministry of Transport3 v
and the Mines Department, and the Minister of Transport will shortly submit definite proposals.CHAPTER XII:- WAGES 14.    TEAT PROFIT-SHARING SCHEMES SHOULD EE MADE COMPULSORY AT ALL COLLIERIES.It is obviously impossible to give full effect to this recommendation until the owners and men have reached agreement upon it.     But a Clause has been inserted in the Mining Industry Bill to facilitate the establishment of a profit-sharing scheme at any colliery that desires to have one.      The Government have also undertaken to appoint a Committee to examine the profit-sharing proposals of the Commission and also the question of family allowances. But it is hardly practicable to proceed with this until the, stoppage is over.15.    TEAT &quot;THERE MAY BE AN ADVANTAGE IE THE TWO PARTIES AGREE IN HAVING A NATIONAL WAGES BOARD WHICH SHALL BRING IN ALSO IMPARTIAL ELEMENTS OUTSIDE THE COAL INDUSTRY ITSELE.&quot;In view of the strong dissent of the parties, the Government have decided not to proceed with this at present.CHAPTER XIII - HOURS 16.    THAT GREATER ELASTICITY SHOULD BE INTRODUCED INTO THE LAW GOVERNING THE HOURS OF WORK UNDERGROUND.This question has been merged In the larger question -of the length of the working day.CHAPTER XV - RECRUITING AND PERSONNEL 17.    THAT THE MINBOWNSRS AND MINERS SHOULD CONFER TOGETHER WITH A VIEW TO CONSIDERING,   IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE MINISTRY OF LABOUR, PRACTICABLE STEPS FOR SECURING THE
TRANSFER OF UNEMPLOYED MINERS FROM ONE DISTRICT TO ANOTHER AND FOR GIVING SUCH MINERS THE FIRST CHANCE OF OBTAINING SUCH COLLIERY EMPLOYMENT IN PREFERENCE TO THE RECRUITING OF OUTSIDE LABOUR,The Mining Industry Bill gives the Minister of Labour power to make regulations on this subject. 16N THAT THE MIiJES DEPARTMENT SHOULD CONS ID&quot;,R THE REGULATIONS GOVERNING THE QUALIFICATIONS OF MINE MANAGERS.This has already been taken up with the Board for Mining Examinations who are arranging conferences with the educational authorities concerned.CHAPTER XVII - HOUSING. 19,    THAT THE STATE AS ROYAL&apos; &quot;Y OWNER SHOULD ENSURE THAT -ADEQUATE PROVISION WILL BE MADE FOR THE HOUSING OF THE WORKERS.The Government have undertaken to set up a Committee on Housing in colliery districts. Administrative action on this rests primarily with the Ministry of Health.CHAPTER XVIII - WELFAREo BO. THAT ROYALTIES SHOULD CONTRIBUTE TO THE WELFARE FUND AND THAT PITHEAD BATHS FINANCED OUT OF THE WELFARE FUND SHOULD BE MADE GENERALLY COiLPULSORILY.Part III of the Mining Industry Bill gives effectto this recommendation.CHAPTER XIX - ASSOCIATION OF THE WORKERS. 21^ THAT PIT COIIUITTELS SHOULD BE MADE COMPULSORY BY THE REVIVAL OF THE APPROPRIATE PORTIONS OF PART II OF THE MINING INDUSTRY ACT,   1920.The Government have never committed themselves to legislation on this subject.-    All they have undertaken
to do is &quot;to prepare a scheme for the establishment of pit Committees&quot;*      The mineowners have indicated that they are willing to sec  if arrangement8&apos; cannot be made for the general provision of pit committees on a voluntary bssis, and In these circumstances it  is clear that no action can be taken by the. Government until there has beeu an opportunity of discussing the matter with both sides of the Industry.,CHAPTER XXI - THE PRESENT SITUATION. 22. THAT THE G0VHRHL1ENT SHOULD BE HEADY TO TAKE ALL PRACTICABLE MEASURED FOR THE ASSISTANCE OP ANY LABOUR THAT MAY BE DISPLACED OR FOR FACILITATING ITS TRANSFER AND TO xROYIDE SUCH FUNDS AS 1.IIGHT BE REQUIRED FOR THOSE PURPOSES.This is     matter for the-Ministry of Labour.      The situation will presumably have to be met as it arises.,,.Mines Department.June.22nd,  192 6.
