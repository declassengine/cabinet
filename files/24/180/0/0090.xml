The Committee find that the Industry is of substantialra. 21. importance; &quot;that only in the case of cotton stockings andhose and cotton underwear are foreign goods being imported into and retained for consumption in tho United Kingdom in abnormal quantities&quot;  (though figures of output are not obtainable); that in certain lines, particularly cotton ra. 25. hose and half-hose and cotton underwear, the price at which such goods are being imported is below the price at which similar goods can be manufactured in the United Kingdom;  and ra. 30. that at the present moment oraployment in the industry asa whole is not being seriously affected, but that employ-ment in the cotton hose and underwear branch may possibly be seriously affected in the near future.    The Committee ra. 26. point out that the average percentage of unemployment inthe industry during 1925 was 6.4,  and during the three months January to March,  1926, was 4.5.      It should be ra. 29. noted, however,  that the comparatively favourable employmentfiguros are duo to the development of the artificial silk trade and the change over of machines and workers from the manufacture of cotton hosiery to silk, ^a. 35,  he Committee find that the present competition isunfair, owing to the low wages paid in France, Belgium, Czeoho-Slovakia, Germany, Italy and Japan;  and that &quot;tho ra. 31. recent continued depreciation in tho French and Belgian-1-THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.
currencies has undoubtedly afforded an additional advantage to these countries.&quot;The Committee also find that the industry is carried on efficiently and economically, although they emphasise the advantages gained by foreign manufacturers in the production of very cheap articles by the adoption of mass production me thods.There is no industry dependent on or subsidiary to the hosiery industry which might be adversely affected by the imposition of a duty.The Committee do not recommend the imposition of a duty at present,  on the grounds that it has not been fully established that employment in the industry as a whole is being seriously affected by foreign importations j but they say: -&quot;If,  on the other hand,  the importation of cotton hose and. half hose and cotton underwear continues to increase,  as is the tendency at present, accompanied by an increase in unemployment the committee would, suggest that the Applicants should be afforded a further opportunity of putting forward fresh evidence on the question of costs of production,  and more particularly on the effect of mass production and. standardisation on such costs of production, as the information furnished to us was not sufficiently definite to enable us  to come to any conclusion in the matter.&quot;My colleagues will see that the Report is not unlike that of the Committee which considered the V,orsted application (CP.96 (26));    and I propose to take the same course as was approved in respect of that report - that is,  to watch with the assistance of the Customs and the Ministry of Labour,  the progress of imports and of unemployment and, should both increase,  to bring the matter before the Cabinet again.If this be agreed there remains the  question of publication.    If I followed the established rule of delaying publication of the report until we were in a position to take action on it,  should action be necessary,  there would be a delay of seven or eight months.   Uncertainty as to whether
there is to be a duty or not might aotually encourage imports.    I think therefore that it would be better to make an exception to our general rule (as we did in the case of the Superphosphate report) and to publish the report at onoeeP.C-L.Board of Trade,27th July,  1926.
SaSEGUAHDDTG   OF   HOTS TRIESHOSIERY   EHOJJIRYREPORT    GP    COMMITTEE.
The Right Hon. Sir Philip Cmiliffe-Lister. H.B.E., Wo., M.P.,eto. .President of the Board of Trade.Sir.1. We were appointed on the 25th February. 1926.  as a Oommitt.ee to enquire into and report upon an application by the National Joint Industrial Council of the Hosiery Trade for the imposition of a. duty under the Safeguarding of Industries procedure on Hosiery and Knitwear of cotton and wool.2. We have held 23 meetings. 19 of which have been public sittings,.     Evidence was heard from 36 witnesses. 22 being called by the applicants and 14 by the Hosiery Trade Group Committee which opposed the application.3. Both sides were represented by Counsel. Mr, Bernard Paraday instructed by Messrs. &quot;Viaard Oidham Crowder &amp; Cash appearing for the applicants and Mr. A.S. Comyns Carr. E.C., and Mr. CP. Entwistle instructed by Messrs.  Stikeman &amp; Co. on behalf of the Opponents.4. The Applicants indicated that they were applying -for a duty on all classes of Hosiery and Knitted goods if of cotton or wool or containing such proportion of cotton or wool as would entitle them to be classified as &quot;chief value cotton&quot; or &quot;chief value wool&quot;.     Thus a duty was proposed on all such goods as stockings, hose, half-hose, knitted gloves,  jerseys, cardigans, waistcoats, pull-overs, knitted sports coats, costumes,  dresses,  skirts,  etc.. nightdresses and underwear of all descriptions. Including vests, pants,  directoires. petticoats, bodices, combinations, etc.     Articles of silk or artificial silk were specifically excluded from the scope of the Enquiry, though it became evident from the outset that there was no clearly defined line of demarcation between hosiery of different materials.      In differentiating knitted from, woven material the Applicants indicated that in the latter the
material consists of two distinct threads, the &quot;warp&quot; and the &quot;weft&quot;,  running in different directions, whereas in the case of knitted goods, the material is composed of one continuous thread knotted in and out.5. In their statement of case the Applicants asserted that the application had the unanimous approval of the National Industrial Council of the Hosiery Trade on which both employers and workers were represented, and that the National Federation of Hosiery Manufacturers&quot; Associations, which constituted the employers1  side of the Joint Industrial Council comprised about 90 per cent, of the manufacturers of Hosiery in the Midland counties.     The Scottish Manufacturers of Hosiery were also stated to approve the application though they were not actually parties to it.6. The Hosier;/ Trade Group Committee, was a Committee consisting largely of importers, Warehousemen, General Textile Merchants and Retail Drapers which was formed specially to oppose the application. It was made clear to us that the&quot; Group Committee is no way represented the London Chamber of Commerce, in spite of the fact that many of the members of the Group Committee were also members of the Textile Trade Section of the Chamber.7. The main contention of the Applicants was that so far as cotton hosiery was concerned the bulk of the trade in the cneaper lines had already been lost to such foreign countries as Germany* America, Italy, Czecho-Slovakia and Japan, and that it was impossible under present conditions*for British Manufacturers to produce equivalent goods at tne prices at which the foreign materials were being offered..     The Applicants further contended that foreign competition was gradually extending to the more expensive and better class lines of cotton goods and that although as regards wool the British industry had been able in the past to maintain its position fairly well an increasing volume of foreign competition was now
now being felt.    The Applicants feared,. therefore, that if a duty were placed solely on cotton hosiery and knitwear therewould be so serious a displacement of cotton goods by importedwoollen goods as to affeot detrimentally the whole industry.They suggested consequently that any duty imposed should be levied equally on woollen and cotton hosiery,8,    The Opponents suggested that the cotton hosiery importshave been for some time and still are declining and, apart fromspecialities such as lisle hose, were confined to the verycheapest class of goods which British Manufacturers did notconsider it worth their while to produce, whereas in the higher grades of articles British Manufacturers were still able without undue difficulty to maintain their position.    It was alsocontended by the Opponents that the imports of woollen hosierywere insignificant and that having regard to the fact that present fashion was largely in the direction of goods containing a percentage of artificial or real silk, adequate protection was already afforded to the industry by the recent duties on silkand artificial silk.9.    On this latter point the proposition of the Applicantswas that such development as was taking place, partly as aresult of the silk duties, was confined, no far as articles which came within the scope of the present enquiry were concerned, to the so-called &quot;new&quot; Hosiery trade,  he. to thetrade in Fancy outerwear of knitted materials which has grown at a rapid rate during the last few years.     the applicants admitted that there was an appreciable productionof &quot;Fancy&quot; Hosiery even so far back as 1907, when thefigure for Fancy Hosiery in the Census of Production takenin that year was over  900,000, but they contended that the term &quot;Fancy&quot; Hosiery did not then apply to the wide range of goods which it now covers but was limited to hoseand half hose with fancy tops or of fancy design, cardigans,jerseys,
jerseys,  etc.   The suggestion of the Applicants was. therefore, that the Fancy Hosiery trade as it. is known to-day-was in effect of post-war introduction and that as regards this section of the industry the year 1920 should be taken as the standard of comparison.,10.    The Opponents maintained that speaking generally, the goods imported were either of a kind not made in this country or wore specially cheap lines, manufactured by mass production methods.    They further asserted that, as regards the latter, in those cases in which British manufacturers had adopted similar methods of largo-scale production the foreign imports had been replaced to a considerable extent by goods of home manufacture.    The Opponents also contended that as regards unemployment the Hosiery Industry was in a specially favourable position as compared with other industries, and that  such unemployment as existed was due almost  entirely to changes of fashion.    It was also asserted that in certain expensive articles such as Lisle thread hose British manufacturers had up to the present been unable to supply a satisfactory quality.11.    With these preliminary remarks on the main arguments put forward by both sides it is proposed to proceed to a consideration of the specific questions upon which we are asked to report as indicated in Section 11 of the White paper Cd.2327.(1) Whether the applicant industry is by reason of the volume of employment engaged in the production of the .goods,to which the application relates, or by reason of the nature of the goods produced,  an industry of substantial importance.12. The total number of people registered under the Insurance Acts as being employed in the Hosiery Industry in July 1925 was 96,960 of whom 22,000 were males and 74,910 females. Of this number about 75,000 were stated to be employed in theMidlands
Midlands and to be directly represented on the National Joint Industrial Council of the Hosiery Trade,     About 17,000 are employed in Scotland but this number is engaged practically entirely in making woollen goods.     On account of the number of persons employed and the importance of the Industry to the well-being of the nation generally,  it was agreed by both sides that it could claim to be regarded as an industry of substantial importance, as defined by the White Paper,     With this we are in agreement,(2) Whether foreign g;oods of the^class or description to which the application relates are being imported into and retained for consumption in the United Xinfidom, in abnormal quantities.13. Owing to the fact that prior to 1920 there are no separate figures giving the imports of underwear and fancy hosiery and as the form ox the statistics relating to gloves has been changed on more then one occasion In recent years it is impossible,  except in the case of stockings and hose to form any reliable estimate of the extent of the imports during the last few years, as compared with 1913.     The Applicants contend, and. we are in agreement, that with articles so varied in character, size and material as Hosiery nc statement of absolute quantities can give a correct indication of the extent of imports as calculated in units of labour whereas on the other hand the alteration in the value of money vitiates any comparision based on absolute values,3.4Complete statistical tables showing the imports of all classes of hosiery and the countries from which consigned, are given in Appendix A to this Report, but taking the various classes of Hosiery separately the retained imports of cotton stockings and hose during the years 1913 and 1920 to date were as follows:-Table

The Applicants maintained that an appreciable proportion of the imports of knitted outerwear, particularly such articles as sports coats, costumes, jumpers,&amp;c were returned under the heading of Womerfe and Girl&apos;s apparel, even though this latter heading was intended to be restricted to woven goods.      The Committee consider that there is some justification for this assumption and they would accordingley suggest that any possible steps should be taken with a view to securing that in future all imports of knitted outerwear are correctly entered under the heading of Fancy Hosiery.17. In the case of Gloves the statistics have been altered on two   occasions, and it is consequently impossible to make any comparison between the imports during particular years or to draw any reliable conclusion from the figures alone. The Committee propose therefore that whatever course is taken with regard to other knitted goods should also be followed in the case of knitted gloves,18. Detailed statistics of the exports of the various classes of Hosiery during the years 1913 and 1920 to 1925 are given in Appendix B to this Report, but owing to alterations in classification it is not possible to make any direct comparisons with per-war years,  except as regards stockings and hose.In the case of the latter the exports in 1925 were 924,945 dozen pairs of cotton hose and 4,184,110 of woollen hose as compared with
st   a721,967 dozen pairs, and 2,364,406 dozen pairs respectively in 1913. The total value of the exports of hosiery of all descriptions (excluding gloves)  in 1925 was valued at  6,699,267 as compared with  2,637,773 in 1913, but by far the greater proportion of this increase took place in 1&apos;cuollcn Stockings    and hose which rose from  961,151 in 1913 to  4,007,300 in 1925. The Applicants, however, apprehended that consequent on the new Australian Tariff there would be a considerable decline in the exports of British Hosiery to the Commonwealth in future.19*    Bo detailed figures of the production of Hosiery were furnished to the Committee, the Applicants maintaining that owing to the great variety of articles produced and the different materials used in their production it was not possible to furnish reliable figures of output.    By taking the Census of Production of 1907 as the basis the Applicants estimated that the production in 1913 was about  14,400,000 as compared with  8,638,000 in 1907.    The Committee are inclined to the view that the figure given for 1913 is approximately correct.    By a series of calculations based on the numbers employed and wages earned the Applicants estimated that the production in 1925 was about  22,875S0C0 of which  9,375,000 was Fancy Hosiery or so-called &quot;New&quot; Hosiery, i.e. knitted outerwear. This estimate is based on the assumption that the average wage in 1925 throughout the industry was 50s. per week and that wages represent about 33^ of the factory selling price. According to the Ministry of Labour Gazette for June 1925 the average weekly wage in the Hosiery Industry in 1925 was 34s. 9d. per week and from a number of costings submitted by the applicants it would appear that wages only represent on an average about 25fi of the factory selling prices.    By taking these figures as a basis the average production per person employed in 1925 was approximately  350.    Assuming that about
SO,COO people were engaged on the production of hosiery goods of silk and artificial silk which are outside the scope of the present enquiry and after making adequate allowance for unemployment and undor-employment the total production of Hosiery of cotton and wool during 1925 would appear to be about  25,000,000.    This figure, however, can only be taken as a very rough estimate and is probably too low;20. An examination of the figures given in paragraphs 14 and 15 shows that the imports of cotton stockings and hose for the year 1925 were about 2-g- times those of 1913 whilst cotton underwear is being imported at about twice the 1913 rate. The imports of woollen stockings and hose declined in 1925 though there was an apparent slight rise in the first 3 months of 1926, whilst the figures for woollen underwear show a continual decline since 1923,    The imports of fancy hosiery both of cotton and wool are small though there was a considerable increase in the first quarter of the present year, in the case of woollen fancy hosiery.    These particular imports are no doubt special lines the demand for which is largely influenced by fashion.21. In view of all the circumstances the Committee consider, therefore, that only in the case of cotton stockings and hose and cotton underwear, are goods of the class or description to which the application&apos;relates being imported into and retained for &quot;consumption in the United Kingdom in abnormal quantities.    ?/e think it wise to state, however, that in arriving at this conclusion we were guided almost entirely by the relative import figures, as in the absence of reliable figures of output it was impossible to proceed on any other basis.
5711f 3) Whether foreign, goods so imported are being sold oroffered -for sale at jorices &quot;whioh are-below the prices at which&apos;similar goods can be &quot;profitably  anufaotared or produced in the United Ziiigdom.22. At the outset of the Enquiry the Applicants submitted a large range of samples of various kinds of hosiery of foreignmanufacture on which were given the price to the wholesalerand the estimated cost of material and labour which would benecessitated by the manufacture of similar articles in thiscountry.    In practically all cases it was indicated that theprime cost for materials and labour was at least equal to ifnot greater than the selling price of the foreign article.The Committee had no opportunity, however, of investigating the costs of production of the whole of these items asdetailed costings of only a limited number of articles werefurnished to them.    Such costings as were submitted tended toshow that there was a considerable variation In the amount ofthe difference between the British and Foreign costs,      the opponents maintained that the methods of manufacture employedabroad, particularly in the cheaper grades of articles,were directed towards production on mass lines with the consequentelimination of all unnecessary waste and the concentration ofthe whole of the various processes involved under one control.For example it was stated, in the case of cheap cotton hose ofwhich large quantities are imported from America that oneAmerican concern produced 25,000 dosen pairs per day orapproximately 100 million pairs per annum.    This factory, or rather group of factories, was stated to grow its own cottonto carry out all the processes of manufacture, including dyeingand finishing, to recover and re-spin any waste produced in manufacturing operations ana to market its products through a highly efficient and specialised selling organisation.    the applicants
applicants alleged that the surplus production of this and other similar American manufacturers was being disposed of in this country at unr emunerative prices.   A detailed costing,  furnished by these American manufacturers showed, however, that the particular grade of cheap stockings which was imported by them into the United Kingdom at about 4/6d. per dozen cost about 3/ll-ld.to manufacture.    Contrasting this costing with the cost of production of the same article as put in by a British firm the Opponents pointed out that although the actual wages in America are higher than in Great Brits/in the cost of labour per dozen pairs of stockings is considerably less.     This, according to the Opponents, was due to the larger number of machines which are operated per worker in the United States of America as compared with this country.    There was also a very large difference in the cost of dyeing and finishing in America as compared with the United Kingdom and this was stated by the Opponents to be due entirely to the fact that it is the practice in this country to send out hosiery to be dyed and finished whereas in the United. States of America it is done on the premises by the particular manufacturer concerned.    The Applicants,  on the other hand,  contended that dyeing and finishing when performed by a firm specialising solely on that work was more efficiently done and that there was no material extra cost involved, by the sending out of the work.S3, There was also general agreement that the quality Ifof British made hosiery was superior to that of foreignIforigin both as regards actual manufacture and wearingcapacity.    In this the Committee also agree.    In the case ijI; Iof certain very low grade cotton shirts imported from japan and j&apos;   I
and retailed at. about 6-gd. each it was asserted by the   &amp; t &amp; Opponents that no British manufacturer would, apart from any question of cost, undertake to produce so low a quality. Cheap American and C z e cho-S1ovaki an hose were also very severely criticised on the ground of defective workmanship and inferior finish,,24. Owing to this difference in quality between the British and foreign articles and the absence of reliable costings both of the British and foreign products,  together r/lth the change in fashion produced throughout the trade by the introduction and continual development of artificial silk hosiery it is difficult to give a complete answer to the question whether foreign goods are being offered for sale in the United Kingdom at prices below those at which similar goods can be profitably produced in this country.    On such evidence as the Committee have had before them they are satisfied that the Applicants failed to demonstrate the existence of any systematic dumping or unloading of stocks on this market by foreign rnsxuxfacturers or merchants.    On the other hand there are a number of cheap articles of low qualify at present being imported, particularly from Japan, which are being offered at prices at which it is very difficult for British hosiery manufacturers with their present organisation and system of working to compete.   Whether the adoption, as suggested by the Opponents,  of methods of mass production -though it would undoubtedly result in some reduction of costs -would enable British manufacturers to effect such economies as &quot;would place them in a satisfactory competitive position is a matter on which it is difficult for the Committee at this stage to express a, definite opinion.Ct o.
25. The Committee are satisfied that in certain lines,particularly in cotton hose and half hose and cotton underwearforeign goods are heing sold or offered for sale at pricesbelow those at which similar goods oan at present profitablybe produced in the United Kingdom under existing conditions.(4/ Whether, by reason, of the severity and extent of such oojape 111ion, &quot;emp 1 oyment JLil, &quot;the^manuiTacture&apos; ,57&quot; pro duo ti on &quot;of&apos; such &quot;&quot;goo&quot;dsi in the&quot; Ifni te  &quot;kingdom is &quot;being, or is likely jTo&apos;&quot;pe,  seriously a7?ectgjrl.26. As already indicated the total number of personsemployed in the Hosiery Industry, as disclosed by theMinistry of Labour returns,  in July 1925,was 96,960 ofwhich 22,050 were males and 74,910 were females.      Thesefigures do not include young persons of 14 and 15 years ofage but include clerks,  carters, maintenance people,mechanics, etc.     In addition there are stated to be anumber of outworkers still engaged, in the industry, but ithas not bean possible to secure any reliable data as to theextent to which they exist at presemt.     The best estimateavailable puts the figure at about 5,000 so that with theaddition of say 10,000 jiivenileo under 16 years of age and1,000 salaried, persons not insured the total number ofpersons employed in the industry is increased to about113,000.      The estimate of 10,000 juveniles is based on the returns of 7 representative firms which submitted detailsof their employees classified according to age, whichreturns showed that 13 per cent, of their total number ofworkers consisted, of persons under 16 years of age.     TheMinistry of Labour returns show that during the year 1925the average percentage of unemployment In. the industry was,4.      The highest figure given during the year was 10.2 durinAugust and the lowest was 4.7 in December.      The averageunemployment during the three months January to March, 192 6,was 4.5 per cent.
27, The Applicants submitted, however, that the Ministry of labour figures afforded no real criterion of the lacic of employment in the industry, as in addition to those totally unemployed, it was contended that there was a large measure of under-employment, estimated at as high as 25 per cent,  in certain sections of the Industry, which was not reflected in the official returns-, as it was an established custom in the trade to share work among the operatives as far as possible so as to prevent their actual suspension or discharge..   All the trade union witnesses, asserted that the year 1925 was particularly bad form the point of view of emplo^yment,  especially in the cotton hose and underwear sections, but detailed information furnished by one trade union leader showed that the total number of weeks unemployment benefit paid to the members of the Union concerned during 1925 represented a total unemployment throughout the Union of only 2*5 per cent.   After allowing a substantial Increase in this percentage for under-employment it would appear that the Unions figures approximated to those given by the ministry/ of Labour for the year 1925. 8. The Committee also ascertained that during the years 1923 to 1925 the total number of persons employed in the industry increased by over 5,000 whilst the percentage of unemployment in the Hosiery trade as shown by the Ministry of Labour figures was, at any given period, less than the general average for the United Kingdom.29. The Applicants stated, and it is no doubt the case,  that the increase in the numbers employed was entirely due to the development of the artificial silk trade and that at present from 15,000 to 20,000 persons are engaged in this particular branch of the industry. This development, with its consequent change of- fashion jfrom/
from cotton to silk and artificial silk, is &quot;bound, for atime at least, if not permanently, to affect the output and consumption of cotton hosiery, particularly of hoseand half hose.   Fortunately the machines employed areinterchangeable and either cotton, wool, silk or artificial silk or mixture of these various fibres can be knittedon the same machine by the same workers.38.   Having regard to all the circumstances theCommittee are of opinion that at the present momentemployment in the industry taken as a whole is not beingseriously affected but the importation of cotton hosieryand underwear is rapidly reaching such proportions as may possibly seriously affect employment in the cotton hose andunderwear branch of the industry.( 5) -Whether such exceptional competition pomelargely ^rbm^QQy^n^x^^yaere] bh^lTonaitions &amp;re&quot;so &quot;different iVorn those in &quot;this &quot;oplm&apos;tr,y&quot;&apos;as&quot; &quot;t&apos;o render &quot;Ehe competition unfair.Competition for the purpose of such enquiry is not to be deemed To be unfair unless it arises from one or more of&quot; the &apos;f o11 owin g cau s e sm: -   -(a) Depreciation of currency operating so as tocreate-an export&apos;bounty.(b) Subsidies, bounties,, or other artificialad^vaLnTages. &quot;*(c) Inferior conditions of employment of labour, &quot;w&apos;h&apos;e&apos;t&apos;he&quot;r as respects remuneration orHETpursof employment, or&quot; ofnerwiTse^,&apos; -obtaining&apos; amongst &quot;tlie &quot;personsi employed&apos;, in the production Jof the imported&quot; ^goods in question as compared with tSbse obtaining amongst&quot; pe r s ons employe dT ITxiTiie ^ pr oducTiori Ox&quot; similar&quot;&quot;g0i0ds &quot;in &quot;tIie&apos;&quot;Umted Kingdom.&apos;31. In the main the competition to which the Britishhosiery trade is subjected comes from the United States ofAmerica, Germany, Italy, Czeoiio-Slovakia, Japan, Prance andBelgium,/
Belgium, and to a much more limited extent from the lletherlStjip^ and Switzerland.    In the case of the United States, Switzerland and the Netherlands, no advantage on account of currency, could at any time be claimed and, owing to the stabilisation of the exchange, the same now applies to Germany, Czecho-Slovakia and Japan.    The recent continued depreciation in the French and Belgian currencies has undoubtedly afforded an additional advantage to these countries as regards the export of hosiery to the United Kingdom and has acted as an export bounty.32.   Ho evidence was given which tended to show that apart from Exchanges there were any subsidies, bounties or any other artificial advantages obtaining in any of the foreign countries from which competition mainly came.33.    On the question of wages the Applicants contended that in Belgium, Czecho-Slovakia&apos;, Germany, France and Japan, the wages paid in the hosiery industry were considerably less than those obtaining in this country.    It was stated that, including the present bonus on pre-war rates, the average earnings of a skilled male worker in Leicester were about  4 a week and of a skilled female worker  2o10.0 per week.    The Applicants did not, however, produce any evidence, either oral or documentary, in support of these figures.    On the other hand the enquiry made by the Ministry of Labour, to which reference has already been made gives the average earnings of all workpeople in the Industry, both male and female, skilled and unskilled, as 34/9d. per week, and, taking the males and females separately, as 54/8d. per week for men and 28/8d. per week for women. Practically the whole of the workers in the British industry are on piece rates and a 48 hour week is worked&apos;.    In contrast to these figures the Applicants asserted that in Belgium the rate for skilled workers was 3.40 francs per hour and for unskilled workers 2.50 francs per hour, whilst in
Czecho--Slovakia the average wage for the male knitter was   577 about 165 crowns per week and for women about 110 crowns per week.   On these figures the average earnings in Belgium for men and women would be about 30/- per week and 22/- per v/eek respectively, and in Czecho-Slovakia about 14/6d. in the case of a female knitter and 20/- for a male knitter. Similarly, in Germany the average wages for skilled workers for a 48 hour week were stated to be about 27/- per week for men and 19/3d. for women, whilst in Japan the daily rates *were given as about 3/6d. for men and 2/- for women.    In the latter country the hours worked were stated to average 9 per day with 27 full working days per month.;    In the case of America it was agreed that the wages paid were, on the average, higher than those obtaining in this country, though the hours worked were somewhat longer^34.    Wo direct evidence as to the wages paid in competing foreign countries was given by the Applicants.   They in-dicated that they intended to rely on certain official reports supplied through the Department of Overseas Trade at the request of the Committee by various British Consuls and Trade Representatives abroad,,    These reports indicated that with the exception of the United States the actual wages paid were on the whole lower than in the United Kingdom.   Further, in certain countries the hours of labour were shown to be longer than in this country.    In Germany, although normally a 48 hour week is worked overtime does not commence until after 53 hours have been worked, the employees being required to work one hour per day extra from Monday to Friday each week for an addition of 5$ to their wages.    In the United States of America about 9 hours per day is the rule and in Japan the normal hours are from 7 a,m.to 5 p.m. with intervals totalling li hours in all per day.    The Committee were unable to obtain any reliable evidence as to the relativeproductivity
productivity of foreign and British, hosiery workers., but areinclined to the opinion that in the case of America theoutput per head is higher than in this country whilst the reverse applies as regards Czecho-Slovakia and Japan,,35.   Having regard to the evidence put before theCommittee by both sides and to the independent enquiriesreferred to above which were made through the various BritishConsuls and trade representatives abroad, the Committee areof opinion that the actual wages paid in France, Belgium,Czecho-Slovakia, Germany, Italy and Japan are lower thanthose obtaining in the United Kingdom and are of such a nature as to render competition from those countries unfairwithin the meaning of the White Paper.(6) Whether the applicant industry is being carried on in the United Kingdom with reasonable efficiency and economy.36.   During the whole of the enquiry the Committee werecontinually impressed with the high state of efficiency which obtained in the hosiery industry and with the cordial relations which existed between the employers and the workers concerned.    The Committee had the advantage of visiting anumber of hosiery works and they found that everywhere therewas a welcome spirit of enterprise among manufacturers whofully realised that it is essential for them to keep theirmachinery completely up-to-date and to take advantage of any new ideas and improvements which may be introduced,   A mostremarkable ingenuity in the evolution of designs and theanticipation of demands was noticeable in several cases, andthe Committee are of opinion that, ao long as the Britishindustry desires to continue to manufacture on existing lines,the present organisation represents the most efficient and economical that can be devised.   At the same time it was clearly demonstrated during the enquiry that a large measure
of the success which has attended the efforts of foreign manufacturers in the production of very cheap articles has been due to the adoption of mass production methods, and the Committee would especially draw the attention of the National Joint Industrial Council to the evidence that was given to the effect that although the actual wages paid in America are appreciably higher than in this country the labour costs per dozen articles in a number of instances were lower than in the United Kingdom&apos;.   This is primarily due to the fact that in the United States a larger number of machines is controlled per operative than is the case in this country.37.   The Opponents laid considerable stress on the advantages to be derived from mass production methods, and the Committee are inclined to consider that if any really serious attempt is to be made by British manufacturers to re-gain the trade in such articles as cheap cotton stockings and underwear such an attempt is most likely to be successful if the example set by America is closely followed and the pro-duction of a limited number of staple lines in large quantities by factories ffontrolling the whole of the processes under one management is undertaken&apos;.    The Committee would also suggest that the whole question of the cost of dyeing and finishing in the Hosiery Industry.as compared with other countries might with advantage form the subject of an inyestigation by the Hosiery manufacturers themselves&apos;.38&apos;.   Having regard to all the circumstances the Committeeare of opinion that the industry is being carried on with reasonable economy and efficiency&apos;.(7) Whether the imposition of a duty on goods of the class or description in question would exert a- seriously adverse effeot on employment in any other industry, being an industry using goods of that class or desoription in production.39.   As, with the exception of a limited amount of knitted fabric which is sold to the making-up &quot;trade, thewhole12555 - 19.
whole of the products of the hosiery industry are utilised bythe general public,  there are no industries which are dependenton or subsidiary to the hosiery industry.      Some time ago  -there was a considerable export trade in hosiery yarns whichsubsequently returned to this country in the form of knittedgoods, but the tendency during recent years in all foreigncountries has been to manufacture their own yarns.     TheCommittee consider therefore that the imposition of a duty inthe csse of hosiery and knit-wear would not exert any adverse effect on employment in any other industry in this country.(8) Whether, having regard to the above conditions. t.h^^applicant industry has? in the opinion of the Committee, established a claim to a duty:    and, if so. what rate or rates of duty, in the opinion of the Committee, would be reasonably sufficient to countervail the unfair competition.40. The applicants claimed that the advantages in labour costs and in other directions possessed by the principal competing foreign countries were of such a magnitude that any duty of less than 45 per cent, would be inadequate to countervail them.     The Committee, however are unable to accept such a proposition,  and. having regard to the fact that they do not consider that the applicants have fully established their case that employment in the industry as a whole is being seriously affected by foreign importations, the Committee do not recommend that at the present time any duty should be imposed on the class of goods forming, the subject of the present application.41. If. on the &quot;other hand, the importation of cotton hose and half hose and cotton-underwear continues to increase, as is the tendency at present, accompanied by an increase in unemployment the Committee would suggest that the Applicants should be afforded a further opportunity of putting forward fresh evidence on the question of costs of production, and more particularly on the effect of mass production and standardisation on 3uch costs of production, as the information furnished
furnished to us was not sufficiently definite ss to enable us to come to any conclusion in the matter.42. In conclusion we desire to express our appreciation of the services of our Secretary, Mr.        Graham, whose able assistance has so materially contributed to the lightening of our labours and. has enabled us to present our Report with so little delay.JAMES CALDERChairman.JULIA MAGUIRE.ARTHUR HOLLIHS.GRAHAMSecretary.10th July,  19 26.
