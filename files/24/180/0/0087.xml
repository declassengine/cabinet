[&quot;This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty^ Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1926.SECRET. Copy No. 30CP. 286 (26).CABINET.COMPENSATION FOR IRISH LOYALISTS.Circulated by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.I CIRCULATE for the information of my colleagues a letter which I have received from Lord Dunedin, covering the Report of the Committee which was set up under his Chairmanship as a result of the undertaking given by the Lord Privy Seal in reply to Lord Selborne&apos;s Motion in the House of Lords on the 15th July, 1925,I understand that although the Report is signed only by Lord Dunedin himself, all the members of the Committee concur in it. I must admit that I had hardly anticipated that so complete a measure of agreement would be found possible.It will be seen that the Report finds that the pledges given at various times by His Majesty&apos;s Government &quot; cannot be redeemed unless something should be done to alleviate injury, where compensation has either not been given at all or has been less than equitable,&quot; and recommends that a Committee should be set up for the purpose of advising His Majesty&apos;s Government as to the payment of ex gratia compensation in individual cases in fulfilment of the Government&apos;s pledges. The Report then enquires what are the principles on which such a Tribunal should act, and sets out two alternatives : (a.) That the standard of compensation to be applied should be that applied before the Free State Act of 1923 by the Irish Courts under the Criminal and Malicious Injuries Acts and by the Wood-Renton Commission in similar cases, Certain objections to this course are pointed out, the chief one being that it would exclude from consideration many, if not most, of the cases of greatest hardship in which the injury suffered would not have entitled the claimant to compensation, even before the Act of 1923.The Report therefore recommends :--(6.) That the Government and the Committee, while taking into consideration the state of the law prior to the Act of 1923 and the measure of the relief afforded by that Act, should have regard to the degree of hardship suffered by the injured persons, over the whole field of the losses suffered by Irish loyalists.I strongly advise my colleagues to adopt this latter recommendation uncon-ditionally. Not only is it the unanimous recommendation of Lord Dunedin&apos;s Committee, but in addition it seems to me to be the only line along which we can hope to fulfil our pledges and those of our predecessors with a reasonable measure of economy. To admit anything like a right on the part of every loyalist claimant to obtain from the British Government the full compensation, which under the old Acts he would have been entitled to receive from the local rates, would involve us in an incalculable, but certainly very heavy, liability; and while, as the Report points out, the adoption of this principle would exclude many cases of extreme hardship, it would, on the other hand, entitle to substantial sums many sufferers who have already obtained adequate compensation under the Act of 1923, for there can, I think, be no doubt that the compensation awarded under the old Acts, was in many cases, on any reasonable view, excessive in present circumstances. If the alternative principle recommended in the Report is adopted, the new Committee will consider primarily the actual hardship suffered by the complainant, and will be able not only to relate its recommendation in each case to its recommendations in other cases, but also to have regard over the whole field of its recommendations, to the extent of the financial liability which the Government are prepared to assume. [14855]
In recommending that a Committee should be set up to advise the Government as to the further compensation to be paid to post-truce sufferers, the Dunedin Committee is not, of course, recommending any change in the Governments policy. We have always intended to do something more for these claimants than we have hitherto done. At the meeting of the Irish Loyalists Committee of the Cabinet, held on the 14th July, 1925, the Chancellor of the Exchequer stated (see I.L. (25) 1: conclusions, paragraph 3) that &quot; on the distinct understanding that such an arrangement would be accepted in full and final settlement of all outstanding and future demands, he was prepared to offer a sum not exceeding  250,000 to be distributed in accordance with the approved recommendations of the informal Committee (i.e., of the Dunedin Committee).&quot; Since that time, as my colleagues are aware, we have received as a result of the Agreement with the Irish Free State Government of the 3rd December last, a sum of  150,000 for the express purpose of dealing with the claims of the loyalists. If we accept the Eeport at all, we must, of course, contemplate the expenditure of a considerable sum, spread over a jDeriod of about two years; and while I do not now ask my colleagues to commit themselves at this moment to a definite amount, I think that the sum we should have in mind should be something in the neighbourhood of the total of these two amounts that is to say,  400,000. All, I think, that we need tell the Committee, when it is established, is that we will ask Parliament to vote this year a sum of  150,000, that we shall not make any grants (except in cases of great urgency) until their work is so far advanced as to enable us to make some estimate as to what the total of their recommendations is likely to be, and that we will then consider what further sum (if any is necessary) we can ask Parliament to vote, making it clear that if the volume of hardship turns out to be very serious, we may have to consider making a percentage reduction in our grants so as to bring the total within a sum which Parliament can be asked to vote in the existing financial state of the country.As to the composition of the Committee, and particularly as to the Chairman, various names have occurred to me, and others, no doubt, will occur to my colleagues. I anticipate that it will be necessary for the Committee to devote not less than two or three full days a week to their task for more than a year to come, and it will not be easy to find suitable men who are able and willing to do this. I would suggest, for the consideration of my colleagues, that the appointment of the Committee and the drafting of their terms of reference be left, subject to the final approval of the Cabinet, to Lord Eustace Percy and myself.I think it very desirable that an early decision on the ^questions arising out of the Report should be reached, so that, if the Report is accepted, it may be published and the new Committee (or, at any rate, the Chairman) may be appointed and an announcement made before Parliament rises. The Committee can hardly get to work much before October; but I understand that Lord Selborne, the Duke of Northumberland and Lord Danesfort are anxious that questions of procedure should be settled before the Recess, so that the Loyalist Associations may collect the necessary evidence to bring before the new Committee as soon as it meets.-L. S. A.Dominions Office, July 21, 1926.Dominions Office,Downing Street, S.W. 1, Sir, July 1, 1926.THE Committee appointed by you to enquire and report whether, in their opinion, any further action should be taken by His Majesty&apos;s Government other than that already taken by them in the interest of persons who have suffered injury to person or property in Ireland since the 11th July, 1921, and if so, to make recom-mendations as to the action required, have asked me to prepare and submit to you a Report on their behalf.I have the honour to submit my Report accordingly.I am, Sir,Your obedient servant,(Signed) DUNEDIN.The Right Hon. the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.
IRISH FREE STATE.Compensation.Report of a Committee presided over by Lord Dunedin.
IRISH FREE STATE.Compensation.Report of a Committee presided over by Lord Dunedin.The Committee was appointed &quot; to enquire and report whether, in the opinion of the Committee any further action should be taken by His Majesty&apos;s Government other than that already taken by them in the interests of persons who have suffered injury to person or property in Ireland since July 11, 1921, and if so to make recommendations as to the action required.&quot; Three of the members of the Committee were selected to put forward the claims of persons injured, and they will be termed in this Report the &quot; Lay Members.&quot; Two of the members of the Committee were members of the Govern-ment. In these circumstances the Committee have requested the Chairman, who is not a member of the Government and is in no way associated with an)&apos; person or societies who have put forward claims, to draw up the Report.There was submitted to the Committee a series of typical cases presented by the Southern Irish Loyalists&apos; Relief Association and the Irish Claims Compensation Association. The lay members, while in no way guaranteeing the accuracy of the statements contained in the cases, said that they had no reasonable doubt as to the bona fides and general accuracy of the said statement and believed that they would be found on investigation to be correct. This Committee did not think it was in any way advisable that they should themselves discuss the merits of these particular cases, still less that they should attempt a pecuniary evaluation of compensation which they might consider due. Taking the cases as indicative of what facts might be alleged and could probably be easily proved, they looked upon them as typical of the various complaints that would be made. The Irish Claims Compensation Asso-ciation asked leave to address the Committee by Counsel. This request was granted, and Mr. L. R. Lipsett, K.C., was heard as to the claims which those whom the Association represented contended they were justified in making.
It will be convenient as a preliminary tp give with the utmost brevity an account of what has been done in the past with the relevant dates.The rebellion which was in progress subsequent to the passing of the Government of Ireland Act was brought to an official end by the Truce of July 11, 1921. The Articles of Agreement which were subsequently embodied in the Act of the Imperial Parliament setting up the Irish Free State and in the Act of the Free State Dail were of date December 6, 1921. On January 24, 1922, a meeting was held in London between British and Irish Ministers, at which a working agreement was come to as regards the implementing of these Articles. This Agreement will be found at length in Command Paper 1911 presented to Parliament in July, 1923.  &apos;Section 3 of this Agreement is as follows: &quot;That the principle should be admitted that fair compensation is to be paid in respect of injuries which are the subject of compensa-tion under the enactments relating to criminal injuries including losses sustained through the destruction of property by order of the military authorities under martial law.&quot;In pursuance of this Agreement, a Commission was established jointty by the two Governments with power to consider all claims for compensation in respect of damage to property in Ireland, exclusive of Northern Ireland, arising between january^ 21st, 1919, and July 11th, 1921, being damage of such a nature as would have given rise to a claim for com-pensation under the enactments relating to compensation for criminal or malicious injuries in Ireland in which no award had been made by a Court, and to review all decrees made by the Courts in respect of damage during the same period in which the County Council concerned had not opposed the claim and in which the amount awarded had not been fully discharged, and in all such cases to report what compensation ought in reason and fairness to be awarded. The Commission had power to attach to their award in any case in which they were satisfied that the destruction or injury had materially prejudiced the economic welfare of the district a condition that the whole or any part of the sum awarded should be applied in reinstating the building in respect of which the award was given or in constructing other buildings in the same district.This Commission sat at first under the Presidency of Lord Shaw, and subsequently of Sir Alexander Wood-Renton. The total amount of its awards was approximately  7,000,000, of which approximately  1,500,000 was awarded subject to a condition of reinstatement.This brings the date up to the time at which the enquiry prescribed for this Committee began. In May, 1922, a Com-mittee called the Irish Distress Committee was set up in London
and was subsequently reconstituted under the name of the Irish Grants Committee. They were originally appointed only to deal with cases where refugees from Ireland were in pressing need of assistance, which assistance was granted ex gratia, but their scope of action was subsequently extended to the giving of advances or loans to persons having claims against either Government under the Criminal and Malicious Injuries Acts, or other legislation for the time being in force in Ireland. They later were empowered to deal with cases of exceptional hardship, but suspended activity in that matter upon the appointment of the present Committee.The position of matters as at the date of the Agreement of January, 1922, was that the Free State are primarily to com-compensate the sufferers from post-truce criminal injury. But at the same time, the British Government indicated with no ambiguity, as will be presently shown, that they considered it an honourable undertaking on their part that such compensation should be paid. The law as to compensation for criminal injuries existing in Ireland up to the passage of the Free State Act of May, 1923, was as follows :  (1) For personal injury, including murder. Originally confined under the Act of 6 and 7 William IV. Ch.116 Section 106 to cases where the outrage was in consequence of the injured person having as witness or magistrate or peace officer been party to proceedings against or the arrest of persons charged with offences against the public peace, the right to receive com-pensation was by the Acts of 1919 and 1920 9 George V. Ch.14 and 10 and 11 George V. Ch.66 extended to all cases of personal injury inflicted for political or quasi-political motives. In the early Act there is no definition of what compensation should be; but merely a statement that the Grand Jury may present such sum or sums of money as having regard to the rank, degree, situation and circumstances of the murdered or injured person they might think reasonable, such money to be raised off the County at large or the Baron)&apos; where the outrage was perpetrated according as the Grand Jury thought fit. By the Local Government Act of 1898 the County Court was substituted for the Grand Jury and the phraseology as to what sum was to be paid was repeated, but in the Act of 1919, Section 1, sub-section 3, it is enacted that the power of the Judge to make a decree for such sum as he thinks just and reasonable &quot; shall include power to make a decree for full compensation.&quot; In 1921 the Irish Court of Appeal had to consider the mode of assessing&apos; compensation in such cases and stated as follows &quot; No definite rule for the assessment of compensation can be laid down, but the Court must determine in each case considering all the cir-cumstances, in a just, generous and reasonable spirit what is the full compensation to be awarded.&quot;
(2) For injury to property.   The Acts 6 and 7 William IV.Ch.116 Section 135 enabled Grand Juries to award compensation for loss sustained by malicious destruction of property. The compensation to be levied on the County or Barony, as the case might be. By the Local Government (Ireland) Act, 1898, Section 5, this function of the Grand Juries was transferred to the County Court. By the Criminal Injuries Act of 1920 10 and 11 George V. Ch.66 provision was made to enable appli-cants who had obtained a decree against a County Council for compensation to proceed by way of a garnishee order, or by order the Lord Lieutenant could direct payment to be made from sums payable to the County Council out of the Local Taxation (Ireland) Account or any fund administered by a Government Department or Parliamentary grant. Further, by Section 7, sub-section 6 of that Act, sub-section 3 of Section 1 of the Criminal Injuries Act, 1919, was extended so as to apply to the compensation awarded in respect of criminal injuries to property. The effect of this was to allow the Judge to pronounce a decree giving &quot; full compensation.&quot; There had been certain differences of procedure in the case of Dublin and of Belfast, but this need not be adverted to as the eventual result was the same.As to what is meant by full compensation there does not seem any doubt that it is just what the common law gives in name of damages for any unlawful act. It was so held in the case of Noblett v. the Leitrim County Council (1920 2.I.R. Page 143). As to what is meant by what the common law gives, reference may be made to the recent opinion of Lord Sumner in the House of Lords in the case of Weld-Blundell v. Stephens (1920 A.C. 9, 5, 6), which defines the liability for damage as a liability for all that is &quot; the direct &quot; result of the injury.In 1923 the Free State Legislature passed the Free State Damage to Property (Compensation) Act and the Damage to Property (Amendment) Act. The former Act made very drastic changes in the law as to compensation. The Criminal Injuries Acts of 1919 and 1920 were repealed. As regards injuries to property committed after 11th July, 1921, and up to and including 12th May, 1923, any decrees which had been obtained were allowed to be re-opened and re-heard on the application, within four months of the passing of the former Act, of the applicant or the Minister of Finance. The former Act provides that all compensation and costs awarded in such cases shall be paid by the Minister of Finance thus transferring the liability from the Local Authorities to the Free State Government. All such applications for compensation under the Criminal Injuries Acts, that is to say, the whole Acts above cited, so far as they were unrepealed, but excluding the Acts of 1919 and 1920, which were repealed, were to be made within four months of the passing of the former Act.   By Section 6 of
the former Act the right to compensation was &quot; limited to coni-pensation for the actual damage done to the property injured and shall not extend to any compensation for any loss conse-quential on such actual damage, and in particular shall not extend to compensation for the loss of the use of the property injured.&quot; Further, no compensation was to be awarded in respect of certain specified chattels, including money and personal ornaments.As regards buildings destroyed, power was taken to clog any money paid with a reinstatement condition.As regards personal injuries committed after 11th July, 1921, persons who had obtained decrees were prohibited from taking any steps to obtain payment of the amounts of such decrees  all pending proceedings were declared void and discharged, and it was provided that no proceedings should be taken under the Criminal Injuries Acts in respect of such injuries.The Free State set up a Committee called the Personal Injuries (Compensation) Committee, consisting of three persons, who were allowed to make awards on application for compensation for personal injury or by relatives in respect of death, where such applications could have been made under the repealed Acts of 1920 and 1921. The recommendation of the Committee to the Finance Minister to pay compensation was to have regard to (inter alia) &quot; the actual earning capacity of the injured person prior to the injury, and to the impairment of earning capacity attributable to the injury, and to the actual extent of dependency of dependents upon the deceased person prior to the death or injury of the deceased person, and to any effective provision made by the deceased person for his dependents by way of insurance or otherwise.&quot;It is evident that the compensation obtainable under this Act and the instructions to the Committee referred to falls short of the compensation which would have been obtainable, if the law had been allowed to stand as it was.&apos; It is also evident that the parties injured could have no legal claim against the British Government. It therefore becomes necessary to. enquire what was the ambit of the promises made on behalf of the British Government at various times, which promises may be now appealed to as warranting further action bv the British Govern-ment on behalf of those injured.A distinct statement is found in a communication made by the British Government to the Provisional Government of Ireland on July 26th, 1922, which will be found in Command Paper 1736 of 1922. In that letter, after setting forth the appointment of the Commission, which had come to be afterwards known as the Wood-Renton Commission, to deal with compensation for outrages prior to July 11th, 1921, it was stated that the Agree-ment was that after that date claims in respect of malicious
injuries should be dealt with in the usual way by the County Courts and discharged by the Local Authorities. It was then pointed out that that arrangement was made in the hope that a resumption of normal civil life in Ireland would allow such claims to be readily presented, dealt with and paid. In fact, however, such a resumption of normal civil life had been made impossible by a rebellion against the Provisional Government which had been followed by a crop of new outrages. Adverting to the fact that an official notice had been put in the Dublin Gazette inviting persons who had been injured to lodge particu-lars of their claim with the Provisional Government, the letter continues :  &quot; The)&apos; infer from this notice that the Provisional Government had been moved to contemplate the settlement of this large body of claims on a national rather than on a local basis. While, however, the responsibility for meet-ing these claims to compensation must rest upon the Irish Government, His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot divest themselves of a duty to see that such claims are met equitable-ably and as promptly as inevitable difficulties allow. They would, therefore, be glad if the Provisional Government would inform them fully and authoritatively of the measures which they are adopting to meet these exceptional claims in respect of injuries whether to person or property.&quot;This communication was laid on the table in the House of Commons in virtue of a promise to that effect by Mr. Churchill, speaking on behalf of the Government.In the debate in the House of Lords on the Irish Free State Constitution Bill on December 4th, 1922, the Duke of Devon-shire, speaking on behalf of the Government, said :  &quot; We have an equal responsibility, reference to which has been made in the course of these debates in relation to compensation, land purchase, and the position of servants of the Crown. It is for us who have accepted that respon-sibility to see that full and ample justice is rendered in all cases. If you ask me to say at this moment how and when we are going to do that, I must reply that it is impossible for me to return a categorical answer. I can only say that we do realise those responsibilities and that we shall act upon them, even if we have to make considerable demands upon the people of this country. We shall not hesitate to do that if we think it is our duty to do so. I can only leave the matter in that position.&quot;When the Labour Government came into power the subject was again mooted, and on 24th of March, 1924, Lord Lans-downe asked the Government to say what was their attitude. Lord Arnold, speaking on behalf of the Government, said :
&quot; The Noble Marquess who spoke last asked what is the position of the Government. The position of the Govern-ment can be stated in a sentence. The present Government in this whole question have considered and are adhering to the policy followed by their predecessors, and they see no grounds for departing from that policy.&quot;Fie was followed in the same debate by the Duke of Devon-shire, who said :- &quot; I wish to thank the Noble Lord for the assurance he has given the House this afternoon that the Government has undertaken to carryr out the pledge which I on several occasions gave on behalf of the late Government, and which we had inherited from Mr. Churchill.&quot;The subject was resumed on the 16th of July, 1924, when the Duke of Devonshire quoted from the letter of the 26th of July, 1922, and said :--&quot; On more than one occasion, speaking as the represen-tative of the late Government, I accepted that policy without any qualifications. I hope, however, that Lord Arnold will give us a full reassurance this afternoon that the policy which he announced in his first speech is still the policy of Flis Majesty&apos;s Government, and that it has been modified in no sense whatever &quot; ; to which Lord Arnold replied :&quot; I would once more remind Your Lordships I repeat this in view of certain observations made by the Noble Duke  that this Government have in no way departed from the policy laid down by its predecessors as to the British Governments responsibility for compensation, but, on the contrary, have developed that policy as circumstances required.&quot;There can, it is thought, be no room for doubt that all the Governments which have been in power since the Articles of Agreement were signed have accepted responsibility in this way. That responsibility seems to be that they would not be content with the mere suggestion that the Free State should deal with the compensation, but that they considered themselves respon-sible for seeing that equitable compensation was made. Stated in this way, the door is opened for two questions. Who are the injured persons who have a right to rely on the promises so made, and what are the rights which such promises give them ?The persons who have a right to rely on the promises made must be those j)persons only who have suffered the injuries in question in respect of their allegiance to the Government of the United Kingdom. The British Government cannot be held to be guarantors for all violence which occurred in Ireland.Then, what rights do the promises give them? Absolute rights, none. They are therefore not in a position of persons who have a right to make good claims before a legal Tribunal.
Their rights are really to rely on the promises made, and those promises cannot be redeemed unless something should be done to alleviate injury where compensation has either not been given at all or has been less than equitable.It follows, in my view, that the Government should now take definite steps to ascertain the extent of such injury and to alleviate it to the best of their ability. It would appear from Lord Salisbury^ statement in the House of Lords on July 2nd, 1925, as to the extended powers which it was then proposed to give to the Irish Grants Committee, that the Government them-selves are of this opinion; but the issues now involved demand, in my view, the establishment of new machinery. The decision as to what grants should be made to injured persons must rest with the Government themselves, but in arriving at their deci-sion they should have the advice of a Committee specially appointed for the purpose.1 think this Committee should be composed of not more than three members (who should not be in the employment of the Government) and that the Chairman should be a lawyer. It should have the assistance of assessors with practical experience of valuation work, and the Government should attach to it a person or persons charged with the duty of contesting all claims. 1 look upon this as necessary and preferable to throwing the duty of sifting and contesting upon the Committee itself or upon any member of it. Long experience has taught me that there is nothing on which it is so difficult to form a fair opinion as an ex parte case.While it would be impossible to tie the hands of the Govern-ment or the Committee by precise directions to meet all cases, I think it necessary to indicate for their guidance some general considerations in regard to the pledges of His Majesty&apos;s Government.These pledges were given in general terms. In interpreting them two possible courses are open. The first is to relate them specifically to the law as it stood at the time they were given, and thus to provide a more or less definite standard which can be applied to all cases. The letter of July 26th, 1922, which contained the original pledge, dealt with &quot; claims in respect of malicious injuries whether to person or property.&quot; If this pledge is to be related to the law as it stood at that date, it must be related to the Criminal and Malicious Injuries Acts, the effect of which is set forth in the earlier part of this Report. In addi-tion, however, it must be remembered that, at the date of this letter, the Compensation (Ireland) Commission, now commonly known as the Wood-Renton Commission, had already been established to deal with pre-truce cases, and that Commission is actually referred to in the letter itself. The establishment of the Woocl-Renton Commission and its terms of reference have been criticised, and it has been alleged that the compensation
which was awarded to claimants was less favourable in some cases than might have been obtainable in the County Courts under the Acts, but the Government have always defended its establishment and the terms of reference given to it on the ground, inter alia, that the transfer of the liability for compensa-tion from the Local Authorities to the Government justified, and indeed necessitated, the establishment of the Commission. A similar &quot; settlement on a national rather than on a local basis &quot; was expressly contemplated by the letter of July 26th, 1922, in the case of post-truce claims, and the Provisional Government was indeed invited to consider &quot; whether it ma)&apos; not be necessary to devise some special procedure for dealing with them.&quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government can, therefore, hardly be held to have given a pledge on this date to assure to loyalists in respect of post-truce claims a larger measure of compensation than that which the Wood-Renton Commission could, under their Terms of Reference, have granted in respect of pre-truce claims.It may further be noted that the Wood-Renton Commission was a tribunal set up jointly by the Free State and British Governments with powers for the re-hearing of undefended cases, both in England and in Ireland, and with elaborate machinery for valuation and the expert assessment of compensa-tion. Neither His Majesty&apos;s Government nor any Committee established to advise them can properly now assume the same powers or can have at their disposal the same machinery. Having the decisions of the Irish Courts before them they would be able to give an opportunity for the presentation and satis-faction of claims which could have been considered by the Irish Courts under the law as it stood prior to the Act of 1923, and for which, owing to the changes effected by that Act, no com-pensation or no adequate compensation has been given, but there would be no formal review of the decisions of those Courts. They would, for instance, be unable, probably in many cases, to deal with complaints arising out of the attachment of rein-statement conditions.As regards machinery, it is clear that in practice His Majesty&apos;s Government and any Committee established to advise them will have less complete opportunities than those possessed by the Wood-Renton Commission for accurately determining what losses should be regarded as having been incurred as the direct result of injuries sustained in Ireland.On this interpretation of the Governments pledges the standard of compensation which would be applied by the new Committee would be that applied before the Act of 1923 by the Irish Courts under die Criminal and Malicious Injuries Acts and by the Wood-Renton Commission in similar cases.While, however, this would cover the class of cases we have hitherto considered, it would not cover a large category of losses such as those arising out of dispossession of lands, out of theft
and larceny, out of intimidation and boycott, or out of expulsion from the country.* To exclude from the scope of the Govern-ment&apos;s pledges the whole body of claims based on losses of this nature would, in fact, be to exclude many, if not most, of the cases which have already been urged upon them and some of which the Irish Grants Committee has already noted for action under their extended Terms of Reference. As I understand it, this would be a result which neither the Government nor the loyalists desire.1 think, therefore, the better course is to adopt a broader interpretation of the Governments pledges, an interpretation in terms of history rather than of strict law. The pledges were given at a time when His Majesty&apos;s Government, on grounds of high policy, were transferring to a Government of the Irish Free State the responsibility for internal administration in that country which had previously rested upon them. This transfer, like all great constitutional changes, inevitably entailed changes in the political and economic life of the country, which must affect all its citizens. So far as the possibility of violent dis-turbance in the country was concerned, His Majesty&apos;s Government could only seek to ensure by agreement with the Free State Government that the principle of fair compensation for criminal injuries should continue to be recognised, and this the)- sought to do by paragraph 3 of the Agreement of January 24th, 1922, already quoted. But there was one class of persons in the Free State who might be peculiarly affected by the change. During the disturbances which had preceded the change His Majesty&apos;s Government had been loyally supported in the dis-charge of the constitutional responsibilities which then rested upon them by a large number of Irish men and women. After the change it became evident that, as the result of renewed disturbances, many of these persons were sustaining grave injuries and heavy losses deliberately inflicted upon them because of their past loyalty. Flis Majesty&apos;s Government naturally felt a special obligation to ensure, so far as possible, that, beyond and in addition to the inevitable dislocation of ordinary life resulting from a great constitutional change, special hardships should not be suffered by such persons for such a reason. It was to this point that the pledges of the Government were mainly directed, and it is this duty which His Majesty&apos;s Government are bound to discharge to the best of their ability-If the pledges of His Majesty&apos;s Government are regarded from this point of view, the state of the law at the time the pledges were given and the relief afforded by the Act of 1923 will both* complaints arising out of deductions from awards or demands for payment in respect of income tax or other charges stand on a somewhat different footing. i understand that such complaints have in the past formed the subject of communication between the two governments in appropriate cases, and we hope that this practice will be regularly con-tinued.
be factors to be considered in examining claims. On the one hand, the Government will take into account any loss which would have given ground for a claim for compensation under the Criminal and Malicious Injuries Acts, including the Acts of 1919 and 1920, and, on the other hand, claimants must show that they have taken advantage of all opportunities offered to them under the Act of 1923 to get such compensation as is allowed by that Act. It will not do for claimants to say that because they had no confidence in the Irish Tribunal they allowed the oppor-tunity to slip. But, in addition to these factors, the Govern-ment will have regard to the degree of hardship suffered by injured persons, over the whole field of the losses suffered by Irish loyalists.I have set out these considerations at some length, at the request of the Committee, in order to facilitate a study of the whole problem. It is very difficult fairly to present such compli-cated issues, and we naturally have differed somewhat between ourselves in the weight which we individually attach to these various considerations. We feel, however, that there is no wide difference between us as to the spirit in which we desire to approach the problem, and that the Governments task, how-ever difficult to define in theory, will prove comparatively simple in the course of practical administration.DUNEDIN.1st July, 1926.(118)   Wt. 7895   125   7/20  S.E.R.
