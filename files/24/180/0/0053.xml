IRISH LAND PURCHASE.Note by the lord Privy Seal.By direction of the Prime Minister I circulate a letter I have received from Lord Chelmsford, the Chairman of the Select Committee of the House of Lords on Irish Land Purchase  (Pledges by Ministers of the Crown), together   with the passages in the evidence to which reference is made.S.24th,  19E6.
116, Baton Square S.Y/.1. June 19th,  19S6QDear Lord Salisbury,I write as Chairman of the Irish Land Purchase Committee to ask whether His Majesty*s Government desires through any of its members to offer evidence to the Committee.I would draw your attention in particular to passages in the memorandum of Mr. Uillis, which attribute certain statements to certain members of this Government. (p. 7 and 8 paras. 61 to 66).      No member of the Committee examined Mr. Will is on these statements, and I draw your attention to them in case the Government or any member of it desires to offer any observations on them.I forward a copy of the minutes of evidence.,   Sincerely yours,(Sd)    CHBIivlSPOHD.II.EXTRACT FROM MINUTES OF EVIDENCE taken before the Select Committee of the House of Lords on Irish Land Purchase (Pled/res by Ministers of the Crown).(55)    In his reply Lord Peel said (p. 413):-&quot;The noble MarquessTs last point Is: At what stage will compensation for malicious injuries, and completion of Land Purchase in Ireland be dealt with by legislation in the Imperial Parliament? ..... As tn the completion of Laud purchase, that in Northern Ireland will
require an Act of the Imperial Parliament, the completion of the&amp; Purchase in Southern Ire la nd will he e. matter with which the Free State Parliament will have to deal,&quot;(56)    This information naturally raised the question of the British Government pledaes on this question,   nid -Lord Oranmore asked  (p0413)  &quot;Play I ask the noble Viscount whether the Imperial Government repudiate any (p.41.4.) responsibility for the promises which have been made to this Parliament to settle the Irish Land question in Southern Ireland as well as ih northern Ireland,  and which have been stated    by several Ministers to be an obligation of honour and a necessary part of a plan of Irish Settlement&quot;.(57)    &quot;Viscount Peel:    I do not understand that the Imperial parliament denies any of its obligations, or any of its undertakings.&quot;(58) &quot;Lord Oranmore and Browne: I understood the noble Viscount to say that it was to be left to tho Free State to complete land pur eh; se in Southern Ireland.&quot;(59)    &quot;Viscount Peel:      In reply to that, may I say that, if you set up this independent Government in Ireland, you Cannot .of course deal with land or property in Ireland in the same way as you could if it remained under the full control of Imp-rial Government&quot;.(60)    The replies to Lord Oraiirnoro 1 s questions were so explicit and so satisfactory, that no further reference to the Land Purchase question was made in the debate.13th March,  19 2. (61)    On th is date  (four days after Lord Oranmore had received the assurances quoted in paragraphs 56-59 above) the Deputation from the Irish Laud-owners1
Convention (referred to in paragraphs 1 and 5 above) had an interview with Sir Austen Chamberlain, Mr. Churchill, and Lord Peel, with the object of asking the British Government to fulfil their pledges on the Land P ur ch a s e quest idn.(62)    V7e were assured that the Government admitted the pledges that had been given up to the present and intended to fulfil them, but that, owing to the Treaty, they were no longer entitled to legislate on any subject in the Irish Free State.      It was, therefore, intimated to the Deputation that tho proper procedure now would, be that the landlords should place their claim before the Free State Government, and ask them to apply to the British Government to supply the necessary funds for fulfilling them, and that if that were done,  the British Government could not and would not refuse to supply them.(63)    Accordingly,  on 19th April,  1922,  a Deputation from the Landowners1 Convention waited on the Free State Minister for Agriculture.      It included two of those who had been members of the Deputation to the British Government -     Mr. Stewart and Mr. Maunsell. They informed the Minister of the procedure that Mr.  Churchill considered to be,  in present circumstances, the proper one, and they asked him to press forward a Land Purchase Bill, and to ask the British Governmont for the funds necessary to provide for fulfill in..;: their pledges on the subject.(64) The Minister promised to consider the matter, and intimated that, while the Free State Government were quite willing that the funds for this purchase should bo supplied by the British Government, they considered th .t any application for then should be made, not by them, but by the landlords.
-4-(65)    The position, therefore, became prectica13 y this-that the British Government admitted their obligation, but subsequently claimed  (and still claim) that they were released from it by the feet that by a new situation, created by themselves, they had no longer the power to fulfil their pledges directly, and that the Free State Government did not see their way to make any request to them on the subject.      It is confidently submitted that, if such a situation arose between two individuals in private life,  the party who gave such a pledge,  even if under no legal obligation, would in a very real sense be  considered under a moral and honourable obligation to make it good, where  (as in this case) the party to whom the pledge was given claimed its fulfilment.(66)    It  is also to be noted that the pledges, given by Lord Peel on 9th March, and those given by Mr.  Churchill on Toth March, were given more than four months after the Treaty had been signed,  and therefore, with the full knowledge that,  if necessary,  they would have to bo fulfilled at the expense of Great Britain,
