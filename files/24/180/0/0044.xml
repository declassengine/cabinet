his document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.CAB I N ST.BET. . .__ O44(86).RUSSIAN MONEY.Memorandum by the Home Secretary  (in continuance of CP. 236(26))  showing the result of enquiries into a payment on the 4th May,  1926,  to tho Co-operative Wholesale Society of  300,000 and subsequent withdrawal of  302,000 by the Society for Strike Pay.On the 11th May information was given to the Home Office by a representative of the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; that someone employed in the Bankers&apos;  Clearing House had informed the paper that Arcos had paid a cheque for  300,000 to the Co-operative Wholesale Society,  and that,  on the same day, the Society had paid the same amount in strike funds.    Enquiry by Scotland Yard went to confirm the information supplied by the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;  and accordingly letters were written,  on the 4th June,  to the Westminster Bank, the Midland Bank, Barclay&apos;s Bank and the National Provincial Bank,  in pursuance of the powers conferred upon the Secretary of State by No.  ISA of the Emergency Regulations,  asking them to furnish particulars of any monies, securities,  or credits,  paid to them or transferred to accounts in their hands from Russian sources directly or indirectly during the first week in May, together with particulars of any dealings in such monies,  etc.  and such further information as they might be in a position to supply, bearing upon the nature of the transactions.No enquiry was addressed to Lloyds Bank as they had already reported in a letter of the 17th May that they were not aware of any transactions of a suspicious nature,  with the exception of a sum of  100,000 paid out of the account with them of the Bank for Russian Trade Ltd. on the 4th May in favour of tho Co-operative Wholesale Society.    They stated they had no reason for supposing this transaction to be anything but purely commercial, but they drew attention to it
as they knew that the Co-operative Wholesale Society acted as   260banker for the great majority of the Trade Union E&apos;unds.The Westminster Bank replied on the 3th June that on the4t* May three Town Clearing Cheques onLloyds Bank, Lombard Street.  100,000Midland Bank, Princes Street.  100,000National Provincial Bank, H.0.         100,000had been paid in to them and that they were informed that thecheques were drawn by Arcos.    They stated that this credit was apparently drawn against by cheques paid over the counter asfollows:-4.5,26.  100,000 (by notes  98,000(by silver  2,0005.5.26.  202,000 (by notes  190,000(by silver  12,000and that on the 8th May  100,000 in unopen&amp;d Treasury notes was paid back to them with the explanation that the Unions had over-estimated their requirements to this extent.    They believe this  100,000 to be part of the  190,000 taken out on the 5th May. The drawings were made by the London Manager, Pro-Manager and the Senior Cashier of the Co-operative Wholesale Society.    In speaking of this drawing to the Bank the Co-operative Wholesale representatives quite openly alluded to it as strike pay.The Midland Bank reported on the 8th June that a1 cheque for  100,000 drawn by the Bark for Russian Trade Ltd.  in favour of the Co-operative Wholesale Society was paid by them on the 4th May.The National Provincial Bank replied that they had no evidence of any transaction during the first week in May which could be interpreted as otherwise than relating to transactions in the ordinary course of trade.    On further enquiry being made they gave particulars of six payments of  100,000 each to the Westminster Bank on the 4th May, none of which could be identified as coming from Russian sources.It was, I think,  a natural inference from the information supplied by the Westminster Bank, particularly in view of their identification of the credit of  300,000 with sums withdrawn for strike pay, that the transaction represented a definite transference of money from Russia in aid of the General Strike.
However,&apos; enquiry was continued and the Co-operative Wholesale..Society wore asked,  on the 12th June,  in pursuance of Regulation13A, by whom the three cheques in question were drawn in favour ofthe Society,  and what was the source of the money involved,  andfurther by whose instructions and to whom and for what purposes themoney withdrawn from the Bank was paid over by the Society&apos;.They reply,  in a letter dated the 18th June, that the threecheques represent repayments of short loans in the ordinary courseof business, by :-The Bank for Russian Trade  200,000 The Union Discount Co.  100,000This tallies with our information;    the Midland and Lloyd&apos;s chequeswere drawn by the Bank for Russian Trade Ltd.,  and the NationalProvincial Bank traced a cheque on the 4th June drawn by the UnionDiscount Go.The Co-operative Wholesale Society,  assure me that the payments covered by the withdrawal of the  302,000, were to trades unions from trades union funds banked with the Co-operative Society.There is, therefore, no reason to connect the two transactions as the Westminster Bank did in their letter, br to suppose that they related to any subvention from Russia in support of the General Strike..W.J.H.15th June,   1926.NOTE.The Bark for Russian Trade Ltd.  is the former Arcos Banking Corporation.    The name was changed in the Spring of 1925,    The Bank figures in the list of Soviet Organisations in the United Kingdom as on January 1st,  1926 recently supplied by Ohesham House on the demand of the Foreign Office.The &quot;Soviet Union Review&quot; Vol.6 No.16 of the 18th April, 1925,  giving an account of the change of name of the Arcos Banking Corporation to the Bank for Russian Trade stated&quot;The change of name of the Arcos Banking Corporation Ltd., to the Bank for Russian Trade Ltd. is a result of the extended scope of the activities of this Bank.............originally intended for financing the transactions of arcos Ltd. its work has now grown to such an extent as to be representative of Russian foreign trade as a whole ........The general policy of the Bank and the system of its operations in financing the Russian foreign trade remain unaltered and it will continue to;act as the bankers and financial agents of Arcos Ltd&quot;.
