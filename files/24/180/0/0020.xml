[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   June 1926.SECRET. f &amp; y p TiA.No. 1.Sir Austen Chamberlain, to Lord Lloyd (Cairo).0(No. 482.   Secret.)My Lord, Foreign Office, April 29, 1926.MY attention has been called to a recent report, with the substance of which I believe that your Lordship is acquainted, on the subject of Wafd plans in regard to the Egyptian Throne.2. I shall be glad to learn whether you are yet in a position to make any comments on the possibility of Zaghlul Pasha making a serious attempt to dethrone King Fuad.I am, &amp;c.AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN.No. 2.Lord Lloyd to Sir Austen Chamberlain. (Received May 25.) (No. 319.   Secret.)Sir, Cairo, May 15, 1926.IN replying to your despatch No. 482, Secret, of the 29th April, I stated in my telegram No! 208 of yesterday&apos;s date that I regarded it as most unlikely that Saad Zaghlul Pasha would make at this juncture a serious and overt attempt to dethrone King Fuad.2. Undoubtedly the desire to dethrone the King exists in the heart not only of Saad, but of very many Egyptians. There are an increasing number of people in this country who feel that there is little hope for it so long as King Fuad remains on the throne. But a distinction must be drawn between the existence of this desire and the belief in the possibility of its early realisation. Saad and his followers cannot but appreciate that the realisation of their hopes in this respect is scarcely a feasible proposition so long as His Majesty&apos;s Government have not had reason to refuse to give to the King any longer their support and so long as British bayonets are here to give effect to that support.3. It would, therefore, I think, be a mistake to conclude from the account of the plans of the Opposition that any definite and immediate move will be made for the actual dethronement of King Fuad. The efforts of the Coalition will, as I conceive it, rather be directed towards restricting the King&apos;s prerogatives and limiting his influence in political matters as far as possible.4. There are obvious and natural advantages in the adoption of such a course. The alliance between Liberal Constitutionals, Watanists and Zaghlulists is an unnatural one, with hatred and mistrust of King Fuad as their common denominator. Its maintenance has, at any rate momentarily, considerable attractions for Zaghlul. It gives an air of respectability to demagogy and, while providing in the persons of the Liberals a convenient cloak behind which to work, as well as a guarantee against attack on the part of the more intelligent and dangerous section of the nation, it deprives the King and the Residency of almost any form of alternative Government.5. Saad is likely, therefore, to try to keep the alliance intact as long as possible. His best prospect of being able to do this lies in the preservation of the common aim hostility to the King. Moreover, success along these lines would achieve, in addition to maintaining the Coalition, a further double object in that it would not only satisfy personal animosities against the King, but also weaken the position of the Residency, inasmuch as the latter&apos;s influence is, apart from direct use of the British Army of Occupation, based to a considerable extent on its capacity, in3475   [14617]
case of need, to make use of the King&apos;s prerogatives, such as, for instance, the dissolution of Parliament. An excessive diminution of those prerogatives would, in fact, deprive me of my most obvious means of control over the Government and Parliament.6: Only in the background of this course of action would lie concealed a design against the person of the King himself. For Zaghlulism is merely Arabism under another name and under different circumstances. Saad no less than Arabi was, is the prototype of Egyptian Nationalism in its restricted sense. The Arabist movement, which was the outcome of the years of misrule of the Khedive Ismail, was in its initial stage a revolt against Turkish domination in the army, in the administration and on the throne. Only in its development did it become religious and anti-foreign. Its success would have entailed the expulsion of the Turkish ruling House.7. The inherent principles of the Zaghlulist movement do not differ in their essence from those of Arabi, except in so far as, in view of the altered circumstances, the expulsion of the British has hitherto been its first objective. Apart from the magnetism of his personality and his eloquence, the strength of Saad&apos;s position is, as in the case of Arabi, largely derived from the popular belief in his pure Egyptian origin. King Fuad, no less than did the Khedive Tewfik, owes the safety of his throne and of his dynasty to the British occupation.8. Egyptian aspirations for liberty and independence are to-day held in leash by two forces, namely, the British army and the powers of the throne. Had King Fuad been other than he is, he might w^ell have been himself the leader of Egyptian nationalism. He has, however, failed to take his opportunities, and though he possibly still cherishes the illusion that he may yet, on the death of Zaghlul, become the popular leader, his personality, apart from anything else, renders him unfit to fill the role. Moreover, his defects are such that he has, as it would appear, diverted the first attacks of Egyptian nationalism against himself rather than against the British. Certainly, at the present moment, popular resentment is far stronger against the King than against ourselves. He is thoroughly disliked and distrusted, not only by the intelligentsia, but also by those classes, such as the land-owners and so-cailed Turco-Egyptian families, on whose support he should, as against an Egyptian Nationalist movement, have been able naturally and absolutely to count. Moreover, he has, almost without exception, alienated the sympathies of the other members of his dynasty.9. Thus, though in one respect, the influence and control which I am able to exercise over Fuad in his capacity as King is a source of strength to me, in another sense his personal failings and the obligation under which I am to maintain his prestige and prerogatives is a severe handicap. It is unfortunate to reflect that I am obliged to waste much of my moral authority in supporting a ruler, many of whose actions are indefensible, who enjoys no credit among his own people and who is so unpopular that his unpopularity is reflected upon me when I attempt to defend him.10. Whilst, however, this is so, the fact remains that our position would become even more precarious than it is, and possibly untenable, if we were to allow the extremist parties in Egypt to weaken the King&apos;s position to any serious degree; and at a juncture like this I have no doubt that our only course is to defend His Majesty and his prerogatives, employing at the same time all our efforts and influence with a view to prevent his abuse of them.I have, &amp;c.LLOYD, High Commissioner.
