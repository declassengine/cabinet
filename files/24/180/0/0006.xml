SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS      ............... 36[14469]
I. ORIGIN OF THE ENQUIRY.   COMPOSITION AND TERMS OF REFERENCE OF THE COMMITTEE.THE question of the pay of Officers of the Royal Army Medical Corps was referred in July 1925, as a matter of urgency, to Sir John Gilmour&apos;s Committee on Marriage Allowance for Naval Officers and Rates of Pay of New Entrants in the Fighting Services.2. Proposals for improving the pay and retired pay of officers of the Corps had been submitted by the War Office to the Treasury in August 1924. In June 1925, after correspondence with the other Service Departments, who also made proposals for improvement in the conditions of service of Medical Officers, the Treasury had replied stating their opinion that at the present juncture no advantage would be gained by increasing the emoluments or the establishments of the Medical Services of the Navy, Army and Air Force.3. On the 30th June, 1925, the Secretary of State for War met representatives of the British Medical Association in conference. The Association^ representatives expressed strong views as to the necessity for various changes in conditions if the Association were to continue whole-hearted support of an Army career for Doctors. The War Office proposals met with the general approval of the Association.4. On the 27th July, 1925, Sir John Gilmour, on behalf of his Committee, submitted to the Cabinet a memorandum on the pay of Officers of the Royal Army Medical Corps (CP. 367/25). The Committee agreed that it was not possible to examine the question exhaustively and report before the Parliamentary Recess. They were of opinion that the general organisation of the Army Medical Service required complete investigation, and that for this purpose witnesses both in and out of the Service should be heard. Such an investigation would take time. Moreover, they considered that the Medical Services of the Navy and the Air Force should also be examined.5. The Committee recommended that the organisation of the Army Medical Service should be examined exhaustively as a whole before any decision was reached on the question of the pay of Officers of the Royal Army Medical Corps, and that the War Office should, if necessary, make temporary arrangements to tide over their immediate difficulties.6. The Committee understood that the question of the status, pay and pension of Nurses in the Army and Royal Air Force required consideration. They con-sidered that this question should be dealt with concurrently with that of the Medical Services of the Navy, the Army and the Air Force.7. At a meeting held on the 7th August, 1925, following a discussion on the Pay of the Fighting Services, the Cabinet agreed (Cabinet 44 (25), Conclusion 8) that, in view of the importance of an early settlement of the pay of the Royal Army Medical Corps Officers and Nurses, an Inter-Departmental Committee should be set up to examine forthwith the pay of officers and nurses of the Medical Services of the Navy, Army and Air Force, and all matters ancillary thereto, the Committee to have authority to take evidence from outside the Government Service and to receive anj- assistance it might require from medical officers in the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Pensions.   The Committee was constituted as follows :-Sir Warren Fisher, G.C.B., Chairman.Mr. H. E. Fass, O.B.E. 1 TDr. II. G. Turney, O.B.E., M.D. J -LreasuI7&apos;Surgeon Vice-Admiral Sir Joseph Chambers.

(A.) Nature of the Problem.11. In all three Services, the obvious difficulty is to attract the right type of candidate for appointment to the permanent Commissioned Ranks of the Medical Services; but, although this is common to the three Services, it does not follow that the difficulties from which they are suffering are the same, since the conditions in the three Services differ in many respects. We have, therefore, examined, in the first place, the actual conditions at the moment in the three Services.(i.) Royal Navy.12. The Naval Medical Service is normally recruited on a permanent basis by means of competitive examination. Since 1921, however, permanent recruitment has been in abeyance, and a short-service system has been in force, with the object of attracting recruits. Under this system Surgeon-Lieutenants are appointed without examination, on recommendation by the Deans of their Medical Schools, and after interview by the Medical Director General, for a period of three years, with the option to continue for a further period of twelve months if their services are still required. The scheme provides that selected temporary officers may be transferred to the permanent service. Surgeon Lieutenants not transferred to the permanent list are entitled to a gratuity of  100 for each year&apos;s service.13. Although the short-service scheme has enabled the Naval Medical Service to tide over a difficult period, it cannot be said to have been successful in achieving its aim of encouraging recruitment for the permanent service.14. Out of a total number of one hundred and fifteen short-service officers entered since 1921 under the scheme, only thirty have been transferred to the permanent list. It is not anticipated that 1924 and 1925 entries of suitable type will volunteer to transfer to the permanent list in numbers sufficient to fill all the vacancies for permanent officers. There is a considerable waiting list of candidates at the present time, but the greater proportion of them are not up to the standard demanded for the Naval Medical Service.15. The temporary officer who does not enter the Service for more than the term of his short-service engagement cannot have that zeal for the Service which is possessed by the medical officer who proposes to make his career as a doctor in the Navy. The continuation of the short-service system is tending to produce a Service in which there will be very few permanent officers, and very few officers with any substantial experience of the Service.16. The quality and number of entrants have gradually improved during the last two years, but the question of a return to the method of direct entry bysfiSSSL8. With the approval of the Prime Minister, Mr. L. G. Brock, C.B., Ministry of Health (Chairman of the Committee of Imperial Defence Man-Power Medical Sub-Committee), was added to the Committee as originally constituted, and at the meetings at which questions connected with the Nursing Services were discussed the Committee had the advantage of the assistance of the Hon. Maude Lawrence, Director of Women Establishments of the Treasury.9.   We have held twenty-six meetings, and have taken evidence from-(1 ) Representatives of the principal Medical Schools of the country, including some who have had service in the war. (2.) The British Medical Association. (3.) The British Dental Association.(4.) Representatives of the Nursing Services organisations, both in the FightingService and in civil hospitals. (5.) The Board of Inland Revenue, on the question of the earnings of Doctors incivil practice.A list of witnesses is contained in the Appendix. Stenographic reports of their complete evidence are on record.10. We have considered, in addition to the questions specifically referred to us, certain points relating to the conditions of service, of officers of the Royal Army Veterinary Corps, since that Corps is closely connected with the Royal Army Medical Corps.II.-RECRUITMENT OF MEDICAL OFFIGERS.   .
examination to the permanent list must await decision in the light of further experience, especially having regard to the better recruiting results that may accrue from the improvements in the Naval Medical Service recommended in this Report.17. The Admiralty consider that the disadvantages in the Naval Medical Service which make that Service unattractive to the average medical student are (1.) The lack of opportunity in the average career for the practice of medicineand surgery, except to a limited extent. (2.) The lack of sufficient opportunity for post-graduate study. (3.) The scarcity of opportunities for specialising.(4.) The curtailment of service by the institution of the early retirement scheme in 1919.(5.) The limited expectation of promotion above the rank of Surgeon Commander by reason of the present small establishment of Surgeon Captains.(6.) The inherent discomforts of service afloat, after a certain age, as a Ward-room Officer.18. The Admiralty&apos;s proposals for the improvement of the situation may be summarised as follows :  (1.) The institution of a number of courses for professional study, which will comprise : (a) General Courses; (b) Specialist Courses; (c) Senior medical officers&apos; Courses.This proposal would necessitate an addition of about ten officers tothe establishment, and cannot be brought fully into force until theincrease has taken place. (2.) The increase of the number of specialist officers, and in the rate of the allowance from 2s. Qd. to 5s. (3.) The increase of the establishment of Surgeon Captains. (4.) The grant of additional seniority for professional merit. (5.) The allowance of charge pay.19. The Admiralty have not proposed that increases should be made in the pay of the Naval Medical Service, but they are of opinion that if increases are made in the pay of R.A.M.C. Officers, the occasion may possibly arise for similar treatment to be accorded to Naval Medical Officers, in view of the fact that candidates for both Services are drawn from the same market.(ii.) Royal Army Medical Corps.20. Officers are appointed to the Royal Army Medical Corps by competitive examination. The establishment of the Corps, including India, is eight hundred and ninety-four; the present numbers are seven hundred and ninety-four; i.e., there is a deficiency of one hundred. Vacant posts are filled by the appointment of retired-pay officers, temporary officers and civil medical practitioners.21.   The War Office set out the difficulties of the R.A.M.C. as follows :-(1.) So few candidates for entrance have been forthcoming that it has been found necessary to cancel competitive examinations, and select by nomination and after interview from such candidates as have presented themselves.(2.) Senior officers are retiring prematurely in increasing numbers.(3.) The present shortage of officers results in an increasing burden of foreign service, with its attendant expense, being thrown on those who remain. (4.) Civil Medical Practitioners have to be employed in considerable numbersat home.(5.) The British Medical Association have constantly urged that the conditions in the R.A.M.C. are not sufficiently attractive to induce keen young men to enter its ranks, and they have gone so far as to state publicly that they do not recommend medical students to do so.22.   The War Office propose to meet these difficulties as follows: 1(1.) To grant comparatively small increases of pay to senior Captains and higher ranks.(2.) To standardise specialist pay, and increase the emoluments of R.A.M.C.officers holding appointments at the War Office.
(3.) To substitute for the eight and a half years&apos; service at present necessary to qualify for a retiring gratuity of  1.000 a reduced period of seven years&apos; service; and to increase from  1,800 to  2,800 and from  2,500 to  3,500 the corresponding gratuities granted on retirement after three and six years&apos; service respectively as Major.(4.) To substitute for the present consolidated pay of the Lieutenant-General, Director General of Medical Services, the pay and allowances of his rank.23. At the meeting between the Secretary of State for War and representatives of the British Medical Association, held in June 1925, the latter agreed that if the War Office proposals were out into effect the greater part of their grievances would be removed, and they would do their best to encourage recruitment.(iii.) Boyal Air Force.24. The Medical Branch of the Royal Air Force differs from the two other Services in two main features. In the first place, as a permanent arrangement, it recruits its medical officers on a temporary basis; on entry, officers are granted short-service commissions for three years, extensible to five years. During their term of service they may be granted permanent commissions within limits approved by the Treasury, at present fifteen per annum, which, with the present establishment, gives approximately a fifty per cent, chance of obtaining a permanent commission. There is no entrance examination.25.   The Air Ministry favour this system for the following reasons: (1.) By the elasticity of the conditions, students of all types are attracted,including those who have not made up their minds to make the Servicetheir permanent career. (2.) The short-service period serves as a probationary period during whichofficers can be selected for permanent commissions. (3.) The prospect of obtaining a permanent commission serves as an incentive to interest in the Service. (4.) Owing to the fact that approximately fifty per cent, of the officers in thelower ranks leave the Service after a comparatively short period, only asmall number of higher posts is required in order to give a good prospectof promotion to those who remain. (5.) The ratio thus maintained between the numbers of senior and junior officers on the establishment has the effect of keeping the average age throughoutthe service low, which is the principle aimed at in the Royal Air force as a whole.(6.) A large and efficient reserve of medical officers who have had actual experience of service is obtained.26. The Air Ministry regard it as essential that a large proportion of their medical officers should be young men who are interested in flying and who take an active part in the general life of the flying personnel. Such men they consider are most likely to exercise that daily and intimate supervision over the health of flying officers which alone will enable them to detect at an early stage any signs of unfitness, and where necessary to advise the temporary cessation of flying duty. The adoption of the short-service system, it is maintained, enables the Air Ministry to select officers of the type required and for the reasons given above conduces not only to efficiency, but also to economy in both material and personnel.27. The second main point of difference is that in the RA.F. medical service no additional pay is given to officers who undertake specialist work or are placed in charge of hospitals. In this respect the R.A.F. medical service conforms to the general principle on which R.A.F. pay as a whole has been based, viz., that officers should receive the flat rate of pay of their rank and branch without the additions such as staff pay, command pay, &amp;e, which are given in the other services for special duties. Apart, however, from its conformity with the general arrangements of the R.A.F. with regard to pay, the Air Ministry are of opinion that there is in the conditions of the work of the Air Force Medical Branch a special reason for the maintenance of this principle, so far at any rate as specialist pay is concerned. The most important function of the Air Force medical branch is and must always be the study of health in relation to flying and the stresses imposed thereby on the
system. In this respect it may be maintained that every officer of the medical branch is in some degree a specialist seeing that his normal duty is the study of phenomena which are new and special and which are becoming the foundation of a new science. The prosecution of this study moreover, necessitates flying experience and Air Force medical officers are encouraged to fly. In the opinion of the Air Ministry it is upon these officers who perform the normal work of the branch with its attendant risks that from a medical point of view the efficiency of the Air Force and the safety of its personnel must mainly depend; and while they appreciate the importance of specialist work in other branches of medicine and are prepared to provide for its encouragement in other ways, they consider that to remunerate it by a higher rate of pay would cause discontent and could not be justified.28. The present strength of officers of the R.A.F. Medical Branch is one hundred and eighty, showing a deficiency of twenty-six; but of this one hundred and eighty, thirty are temporary yearly contract officers, most of them elderly doctors who cannot be sent overseas and whom it would be obviously advantageous to replace by younger men. There is therefore a real shortage of twenty-five per cent. During 1925, sixteen men were granted commissions out of eighty-four applicants, fifty-two of whom did not proceed further with their applications after being informed of the terms and conditions of service. Further, many of the short-service officers are not of the type which is desirable to retain for permanent service.29. The Air Ministry proposals for the improvement of the Service are as follows : (1.) That officers entering on short service commissions should have so far aspossible a fifty per cent, chance of selection for permanent commissions. (2.) That the gratuity payable to short service officers after a period of fiveyears should be raised from  650 to  700. (3.) That a short course at Halton Hospital should be instituted. (4.) That study leave should be granted to permanent officers at any time duringthe first sixteen years of their service, the amount of leave being limitedto nine months in all. (5.) That increases of pay should be granted to officers of the rank of SquadronLeader after four years in that substantive rank and upwards. (6.) That the rate of pay, allowances and half pay of the Air Vice-Marshal.Director of Medical Services, should be the same as that of an AirVice-Marshal, General Duties Branch, the pay being  5 a day.30. It is noticeable that the difficulties in the R.A.M.C. arise not only from a shortage of recruits, but also from the fact that existing officers are discontented with the Service and are retiring in comparatively large numbers. Discontent in this sense does not at present exist in the other two Services.31. We conclude from this preliminary survey of the conditions in the three Services that there is no universal panacea that will restore them all. In view of the differences in conditions we think that the remedies must differ. At the same time it is most important that no one of the three Services which compete in the same market should be put in such a position that its advantages outweigh those of the other two; a balance must be maintained in order that each Service may attract its due proportion of recruits of the right type. But it is not necessary, nor in fact possible, to have a close similarity in detail. Better chances of promotion in one Service, for example, may be set off against higher emoluments or more attractive work in another.(B.) General Considerations.32. It is commonly held that the difficulties of the Medical Services are in the main due to the War. The idea of Government service is no longer attractive; the soldier&apos;s life has lost its glamour; the normal work of the Medical Services is judged by the experience gained by thousands of civilian doctors in time of war when the Services had been hurriedly expanded to an unprecedented and unforeseen extent, and when regular R.A.M.C. officers were employed on administrative rather than on clinical work. It is further argued that these difficulties must pass by the mere efflux of time; the ex-service student, who had had enough of military service, has already practically disappeared from the Schools; and the impressions left by the war on the minds of those, whether teachers or relations, who are in a position to guide the student&apos;s choice of a career are naturally becoming fainter.
The Fighting Services have in fact themselves adopted this view, inasmuch as they did not consider it necessary to suggest improvements in conditions until the shortage of recruits had become serious. But we are convinced that a determined effort to secure recruits must now be made; the R.A.M.C. and the R.A.F. Medical Service will, within a few years, be in a grave condition unless an improvement occurs. The break in the tradition of entry into the Services in itself necessitates some special measures.33. There is no doubt that the civilian profession is better off now than it was before the war. (The emoluments of the medical officers in the Services have, of course, also been increased by the revision of pay in 1919. Part of this increase is variable according to the cost of living.) There has been a great increase in the number of hospital appointments open to recently qualified men; there are more opportunities for specialists; salaried posts under Government Departments and Local Authorities have been created; the fees in private practice have increased; and perhaps most important of all the development of panel practice affords an opportunity, especially in industrial districts, of earning a substantial income at an early age. Another counter-attraction is the great development of the Colonial Medical Services, which compete for the same type of recruit as the Medical Branches of the Fighting Services.34. It was put to us by some witnesses that even though the output of the Medical Schools since the War has been abnormally large, there is no lack of employment in the profession among the men. By others we were told that there is now some;sign of a tendency for the newly qualified man to find difficulty in obtaining the kind of post he desires. General practice is unattractive to many men on account of its uncertainty and the amount of work which is a necessary concomitant of success. The appointments in the Public Health Service are for the most part filled, and for several years vacancies in this branch of the profession will be much fewer. While it is admitted that the financial attractions of a busy panel practice are far above anything that the Government can offer, it is argued that the type of student who entered the Services in the past would never be attracted by the life of a Panel Doctor; and that therefore even the large financial advantage of this branch of the profession does not rob the Services of candidates who are suited to their needs.35. We have endeavoured to ascertain whether the modern medical student in choosing his career looks rather to the opportunities for the highest class of professional work or to the remuneration which he will receive. The question is not an easy one. We are of the opinion that the student will be attracted by a moderate scale of pay indeed, a low one compared with the earnings of a Panel Doctor in an industrial district provided that he is satisfied with the conditions in the Services,, and that the opportunities for professional work are good.(C.) The Control of Establishments and the Number of Officers Employed.36. In Sir John Gilmour&apos;s memorandum (CP. 367 (25) ) of the 27th July, 1925, which led to our appointment, the opinion was expressed, that the general organisation of the Army Medical Service required complete investigation. His Committee considered that no decision should be reached on the question of the pay of officers of the Royal Army Medical Corps until the whole organisation of the Service had been considered; and that the Medical Services of the Navy and the Air Force should also be examined.37. We gather from evidence given us by representatives of the Hospitals that an impression exists in some quarters that the Services are overstaffed. There is no doubt that in the Services the ratio of medical officers to personnel attended by them is very much greater than the ratio of doctors to patients in civil life. In our opinion such comparisons have little value. They leave out of account the important distinctions between the work of the medical officer in the Services and that of the civilian practitioner.38. In the first place, the role of the R.A.M.C. officer, for example, in peace time is not simply to undertake the medical care of the troops under his charge; he is responsible for the training of the whole of the personnel of the Royal Army Medical Corps. In order to meet requirements on mobilization it is necessary that a very large percentage of the rank and file of the R.A.M.C. should serve on&apos;a short service engagement three years with the colours and nine in the Reserve. This [14469] &apos; c
means that a continuous stream of men passes through his hands for training, who after three years&apos; service, pass to the Reserve and are succeeded by fresh relays.39. The establishment of the R.A.M.C. is fixed strictly on peace requirements-there is no margin provided to meet war needs. This renders it imperative that the peace nucleus should be in a high state of efficiency and ready to take the field at a momenfs notice.40. The examination of recruits, too, makes a heavy demand pn the R.A.M.C. officer &apos;s time. In 1924r-25 some thirty-five thousand recruits were examined and attested; a further eighteen thousand were rejected on medical grounds before attestation. This work is one of the most exacting duties which can fall on a doctor and although a small part of it is done by civilians, it will be clear that it constitutes a considerable part of the work of the R.A.M.C. officer.41. Similar considerations apply to the work of the Naval Surgeon and the Officer of the R.A.F. Medical Branch.42. Secondly, a great part of the work of the medical officer is preventive; he has not only to treat men when they are sick, but also, and chiefly, to prevent them from becoming sick. Every man who is admitted to hospital or who is invalided out of the Service is a direct loss to the State, both in manpower and in money.43. Thirdly, the medical officer has necessarily many administrative duties to perform, and much sanitary work to carry out, which have no counterpart in the Life of the civilian practitioner.44. Finally, the rapid progress of both medical and military science demands that constant research work should be carried out by medical officers in many directions, both to adapt new knowledge to the requirements of the Services and to anticipate the needs of the future.45. The establishments of the Medical Branches of the Services are kept under constant review. During the last two years the War Office has completed an enquiry and reached the conclusion that the establishment of the Royal Army Medical Corps has now been cut down to the bare minimum necessary in peace conditions.46. It is inevitable that when in the course of his career the R.A.M.C. or R.A.F. Medical Officer is posted for a tour of duty at an isolated station, or the Naval Surgeon has similarly to serve in a small ship operating independently, he should in normal times be less fully occupied than of the Medical Brancheswill ordinarily expect to be. The Committee understands that every effort is made to keep at a minimum the number of posts in which such a condition may occur, and, where possible, to fill them by the appointment of retired pay officers or civil medical practitioners, not only with a view to economy, but also to counteract the grave disadvantage which the officer suffers owing to his limited opportunities of professional work. At the same time it must be recognised that the medical functions of an officer in. such a post are mainly preventive, and that he must always be prepared for a sudden emergency in which the sole medical responsibility will lie with him.47. Dr. Turney and other civilian members of the Committee have visited the R.N. Hospital at Chatham; the Royal Army Medical College at Millbank. the R.A.M.C. Hospitals at Aldershot, and the Depot at Crookham; and the R.A.F. Hospital at Halton. The Heads of the Services afforded the members every facility, of which they took full advantage, to examine thoroughly the organisation and administration of these establishments. The Committee are satisfied that much scientific w^ork of a verv high type is being carried out, and that the organisation of the hospitals affords no foundation for the belief that they are over-staffed, nor for the idea that there is an undue amount of administrative work. The scientific work done in these establishments provides professional opportunities for a keen doctor wider than any with which he is likely to meet in civil practice.(D.) Remedies suggested to the Committee.(i.) Common to all Three Services.(1.) Amalgamation of the Services.48. Some witnesses have urged that a joint Medical Service for the three Fighting Services, which might even be extended to include the Colonial Medical Service and the medical posts of the Civil Service, is the only rational system.

In June 1922, the Military Hospital at Chatham was closed, the sick being subsequently treated in the Naval Hospital there, and in October of that year the Military Hospital at Gibraltar took over the Naval sick at that station, and the Naval Hospital was closed.(5.) Except for an Officers&apos; Hospital in London, with thirty beds, the Air Force had no hospital at any station where there was either a Naval or Military Hospital.(6.) Since the Joint Medical Services Committee was appointed in July 1923, as the result of the Weir Committee Report, the feasibility of effecting further co-ordination between the three Services has been constantly before that Committee, and in February last they reviewed the whole question.(7.) The present position is as follows :  (a.) At Chatham the Navy treat all Military sick requiring indoor hospital treatment, except women and children. They also treat Military out-patients requiring such special treatment as radiology, electro-therapy, &amp;e, and provide specialist examination in other cases when necessary.(&amp;.) At Portland the Navy treat all Military cases requiring indoor hospital treatment.(c.) At Gibraltar the. Army treat all Naval cases.(d.) There is no Air Force Hospital at any station where there is either a Naval or Military Hospital. (e.) At all stations where one Service has no hospital its sick are treated in the hospital of one of the other Services. L14469j c 249. The policy of amalgamation was exhaustively examined by Lord Weir&apos;s Committee in 1922/23, and was considered to be undesirable. We have not thought it necessary to reconsider this question in detail; and we are impressed by the extreme difficulty of devising any form of joint Service which would meet the differing needs of the Navy, the Army and the Air Force, and by the doubt whether any such joint Service would not be less, rather than more, economical than the existing arrangements.50. The Joint Medical Services Committee has, in our opinion, proved to be of the greatest value in securing co-ordination between the Services. We are convinced of the importance of securing the completest co-ordination possible, but we think that the existing arrangements are fully adequate to that end, and we do not recommend any alteration. The following statement shows to what an extent co-operation has already been attained :  Co-operation between the Medical Branches of the Navy, the Army, the AirForce and the Ministry of Pensions.(1.) Co-operation in regard to Medical Services between the Navy and the Army has existed for very many years, and between these two Services and the Air Force since the inception of the Air Force. At stations where one Service has no hospital, the sick of that Service are treated in the hospital belonging to one of the other Services.(2.) Prior to the War it was agreed to treat the military sick at Pembroke Dock in the Naval Hospital, and to close the Military Hospital there; but the War broke out before the necessary alterations to the Naval Hospital had been completed.(3.) At the beginning of 1922 both Naval and Military Hospitals existed at the following stations : nuval. military.station. number of beds. number of beds.officers.      eatings.     officers.    other kanks.
(8.) As regards the practicability of further co-operation, the position is as follows : (a.) The Naval Hospital at Haslar and the Military Hospital at Netley are both used in time of peace for the reception of invalids from abroad, and in time of war each will be required for the reception of sick from the Expeditionary Force. Cosham, one of the most modern Military hospitals in England, deals with the sick of the Portsmouth area. The feasibility of treating all the Military sick of the Devonport area in the Naval Hospital at Plymouth is at present engaging the attention of the Joint Medical Services Committee. At a preliminary discussion the Committee considered the proposal feasible and decided to obtain more details with a view to its further consideration. These have been called for and will he considered at the Committee &apos;s next meeting.   &apos;(o.) At Bermuda the treatment of the sick of both Services in one hospital is impracticable for geographical reasons. The Naval Hospital is at Ireland Island on the north-west extremity of the group of islands forming Bermuda, while the Military Hospital and the greater part of the Military Garrison are at Prospect in the centre of the group. Water communication between the two places is often impossible during the winter, and there is no motor transport(c.) At Hong Kong the Navy and Army each have a hospital, and the Army also have one at Kowloon for Asiatics. The Civil Government of Hong Kong are anxious to acquire the site of the Military Hospital on the Island, and in exchange to provide a new hospital on the Mainland. This exchange has been agreed to in principle, but is at present held up owing to recent political events having exhausted the Civil Governments funds. As the Military Hospital at Kowloon has been condemned since 1909, the Joint Medical Services Committee consider that the new hospital which will be built on the mainland in exchange for the Military Hospital at Hong Kong should take the form of a combined Naval and Military Hospital for both European and Asiatic sick, and thus provide one hospital instead of the three which exist at present. Details of this scheme have not yet been worked out.(d.) At Malta the Military Hospital, completed since the War, is at Imtarfa in the western half of the island; the Naval Hospital is at the eastern end of the Grand Harbour. The former is not large enough to accommodate the Naval sick, while the situation of the latter renders it most inconvenient for treating- the sick of the Military Garrison. Moreover, Malta would become an important hospital base in time of war, and for that reason it is considered that both hospitals must be retained.(9.) Ministry of Pensions patients are treated in Naval, Military and Air Force Hospitals where the Ministry&apos;s Hospitals are too distant from the patienfs home. The numbers, however, are not great, as most of the Ministry &apos;s patients reside in populous areas where there are no Service hospitals.(10.) The Ministry undertakes all limb-fitting for the three Services and treats Service patients, principally post-war pensioners, where there is a Ministry of Pensions Hospital but no Service Hospital conveniently available.(11.) During 1924, 3,392 Naval, Air Force and Pensioner Patients (includingpost-war pensioners) were treated in Military Hospitals. (12.) The Joint Medical Services Committee also considered the feasibility of co-ordination in matters other than hospital accommodation.    Among the subjects already dealt with or under consideration are : -(a.) The standardisation and &quot;pooling of Ambulance Trains. This hasbeen agreed to in principle and a sub-committee will be formedshortly to consider the proposal in detail, (b.) The standardisation of Motor A mbulance Cars. An improved typeof motor ambulance is being constructed for trial.
(c.) The services of the Army Hygiene and Pathological Advisory Committees have been placed at the disposal of the Air Ministry.(d.) Co-operation between the Medical Services of the Army and Air Force for the evacuation of sick and wounded by aerial transport in time of war. A scheme was to have been tried during the 1925 Army Manoeuvres, but unfortunately had to be postponed.(e.) The unification of Medical Records and Returns. Although it was not found possible to adopt a unified system, certain forms have been amended with a view to simplifying their completion.(2.) Common Entry.51. It has been suggested that a system of Common Entry to the three Services would prevent many of the present difficulties, especially if it could also be arranged that officers might transfer from one Service to another.52. Lord Weir&apos;s Committee suggested that the policy of introducing a common system of entry and a common entrance examination for candidates for the Medical Departments of the three Services should be examined by the Joint Medical Services Committee with a view to ascertaining if such an arrangement would result in economy, and be more attractive to candidates.53. We do not see any way in which such a system could lead to any appreciable economy. If the three Services were recruited by competitive examination, a common examination might be a slight attraction to candidates; but any divergencies in the conditions of the Services would be made more conspicuous by such a system, and if one Service were for any reason temporarily unpopular it would be even more difficult for that Service to secure its due proportion of recruits of the right type under a Common Entry system than under a system of separate examinations. In any case, the R.A.M.C. is the only one of the three Services which is recruited at present by competitive examination; the Navy temporarily, and the Air Force permanently, obtain their recruits for permanent commissions by selection from short-service officers; and the appointments to short-service commissions in those two Services are made on the results of interview by the Medical Directors General and recommendation by the Medical Schools.54. In these circumstances, we do not consider that any attempt should be made to introduce a system of Common Entry, or a common entrance examination. If the systems of recruitment of any two of the Services should in future be assimilated, we think that the question should be reconsidered by the Joint Medical Services Committee.(3.) Recruitment of Specialists for Particular Work, and Engagement of Laymen for certain A1 on-Professional Duties.55. One witness suggested to us that, if a man who had two or three years&apos; experience in a particular line of medical work could be appointed to a special post in one of the Services in which he could carr)- on that work, it would be a great attraction to the better type of student. Men who are looking forward to the work of a consultant will not go into the Services unless they are guaranteed their specialist work. We do not regard this suggestion as practicable. It is obviously impossible to appoint an officer at the beginning of his career to a particular specialist post and to keep him there throughout his whole service. On the other hand, the systems of specialisation at present in force in the respective Services appear to meet this point to a great extent, and promotion for such specialists is open up to the highest ranks.56. Another suggestion made by representatives of two London hospitals in their evidence was that some of the duties of the medical officer might be delegated either to clerks or to medical orderlies. In this connection comparison was made between the Services and certain civil hospitals where the medical staff are employed on purely professional duties, while the hospital administration is largely vested in laymen. We do not think that so much non-professional work is carried out by medical officers in any station that any saving could be effected by the engagement of laymen for administrative or clerical work, and we are of opinion that such an arrangement would not only be impracticable, but also harmful to efficiency. It must be borne in mind that, unlike civil hospitals, service hospitals are parts of the intricate machinery of military organisation and administration. To be a. successful medical staff officer involves not only knowledge of the regulations and procedure governing all branches of the Services, but also the medical knowledge necessary to secure the best measures for the prevention and treatment of non-effectiveness due to disease and for the efficient disposal of the sick.   The carrying out of these
measures requires the experience of command and the tactical disposition of medical units, personnel and equipment. We are also of opinion that it is not possible to delegate the simpler professional duties to medical orderlies. To avoid the clanger Of a man who is really ill being treated by an orderly as a case of no medical importance, it is necessary that every man who &apos;&apos; goes sick&apos;&apos; should have his case dealt with by a medical officer. The importance of this principle is one which is nowadays increasing, as is evidenced by the frequency with which appeals are forwarded on almost every aspect of the medical care of personnel. It is especially important in its relation to cases which may subsequently result in claims to disability pension.57. Although we cannot make any recommendations on the lines of these suggestions, they are of interest in that they show how widespread is the idea (which we believe to be in the main a misconception) that the medical officer has not sufficient opportunity of professional work. We recur to this point in section II. (D.) (i.) (5.) (paragraph 62).(4.) Appointment by Selection.58. It has been suggested by some witnesses that modern experience goes to show that the best candidates for any post are not always those who are most successful at a competitive examination; the general&apos; trend is shown, for example, by the fact that increasing stress is being laid on personal interview of the candidates in competitions for employment in the Civil Service.59. We think that these witnesses did not appreciate the fact that entry into the Services is not by a simple competitive examination alone. In the first place, considerable importance is given to the recommendation of the candidate by the Dean of his School; secondly, he has, as a rule, to attend an interviewing board before he sits for the examination, if one is held; thirdly, additional marks are given for the possession of Certificate A or Certificate B of an Officers&apos; Training Corps. These facts meet as far as possible the point made by the witnesses in question. It is undesirable to appoint to a permanent service on recommendation alone, in view of the varying standards adopted by the persons who recommend, while the possibility of gaining a high place in a competitive examination mayr, we think, be an attraction to such students as attach a high value to professional work, since it is generally known that distinction in the entrance examination is permanently recorded, and that a man may subsequently benefit from this in the way of promotion and in selection for appointments. The recommendations which we make in section II. (D.) (i.) (6.) (paragraphs 72 to 77) on the question of the recognition of hospital appointments will give a further opportunity of advancement to the man who has given attention to the practical side of his medical course, although he may be defeated in competitive examination by one who derives his knowledge chiefly from book work.60. The preceding remarks apply mainly to the R.A.M.C, since the Navy as a temporary, and the Air Force as a permanent arrangement appoint candidates to a short-service commission in the first place, and dispense altogether with a com-petitive examination. The necessit:y of an entrance examination for officers who are commissioned&quot;, at any rate in the first instance, only for a short term of service, is not so apparent, and in this case the short-service system would appear to provide an opportunity for a continuous test of the officers&apos; abilities which should be of value in making selections for the permanent list;(5.) Propaganda.61. It has become evident in the course of our enquiry that there exists among students and among the medical profession generally considerable lack of knowledge as to conditions in the Services. Some of the Deans of the Medical Schools, to whom it falls to advise students on the choice of a career, are not aware of the opportunities the Services offer. Many who have had experience of the Services during the War believe that a medical officer&apos;s normal life in peace conditions is much the same as his life during a quiet period in war-time.62. A very serious misapprehension exists as to the opportunities for pro-fessional work in the Services. Those witnesses who are well informed about the present-day conditions are unanimous that clinical work of a very high standard is being carried on in Service hospitals. They spoke warmly of the work of specialist officers, especially in the field Of hygiene and preventive medicine. One witness went so far as to say that he knew of ho opportunity for the research worker so good as
that afforded in the Royal Army Medical Corps. But the great majority of Deans and students are unaware that it is possible for a specialist to rise to the highest ranks without ever giving up his particular line of work..63. It is obvious that wider dissemination of the knowledge of present conditions in the Services&apos; is necessary. Efforts have been made to bring the facts to the notice of students by means of pamphlets and notices, and also by lectures by the Heads of the Services, but with little apparent result.64. We consider that much more might be done in this direction. One of the points that should be emphasised is that good opportunities for professional work do exist in the Services; and also that the specialist is encouraged to follow the particular branch of the science in which he is most interested. With regard to lectures, it has been suggested to us that, while a formal lecture by a senior officer is looked upon with suspicion, an officer of, say, ten or fifteen years&apos; service who went to his own Hospital or University and addressed the students in not too formal a way on the actual conditions of life in his Service would be sure to attract candidates. He must, of course, be prepared to be heckled; and most important of all he must himself be convinced of the advantages of the career which he is advocating. It has been brought to our notice again and again that the most effective propaganda is that which is informally and almost unconsciously carried out by officers of a contented Service.65. Another point which has been suggested to us is that the propaganda must be addressed to men who are ready to receive it. If lectures are given to first year medical students they may be interested at the time, but they will have forgotten what they were told, or they will have been attracted by some other branch of the profession which has subsequently been brought to their notice, before the time comes for them to choose their career. It is impossible to organise lectures for men who have obtained their medical qualification; the only opportunity to influence&apos;students is in their final year.66. All the representatives of Medical Schools who have appeared before us have been anxious to assist the Services to state their case; and we are assured that the Schools will do their utmost to give opportunities to lecturers.67. The need of propaganda is particularly urgent at the present time, since in most Schools there&apos; has been a definite break in the Service tradition. When there is a steady stream of men entering the Services from a particular School there is no such necessity.68. We think also that the advantages of the Services might be set out more clearly than has hitherto been the case. It has been suggested, for instance, that on the financial side a table of daily rates of pay, with allowances payable in certain circumstances, conveys little to the intending candidate, and might well be supplemented by a statement of the approximate annual emoluments both in cash and in kind.69. A danger which must be studiously avoided is that one Service, to attract recruits, might conceivably exaggerate its advantages over the others, which are competing in the same market. We recommend that any recruiting literature which is to be sent out by any of the Services should first be submitted to the Joint Medical Services Committee for approval.70. Propaganda among the medical profession at large is also necessary, in order to remove the misconceptions which exist, largely as a result of wartime experience of the Services. This is more difficult to arrange than propaganda in the Schools. The British Medical Association has considerable influence, and we are convinced that if its co-operation is secured as the result of improvements recommended in this Report the Services will derive great advantage from its assistance.71. An attractive suggestion has been made to us, which may be mentioned here. It is that if one of the Services were to take over a Civil Hospital, and run it for the common benefit, its work would be brought to the notice of the public, and at the same time its officers would gain in professional experience. For financial reasons we cannot regard the suggestion as a practicable one; but it is obvious that its originator entertained no doubts as to the capacity of Service officers to carry out work of the highest professional standard which lies altogether outside their normal duties.(6.) Recognition of Hospital Appointments.72. It has been suggested by several witnesses that in view of the keenness of the modern medical student on his professional work, and of the fact that more
Tesident appointments are now available than there used to be, students should be encouraged to hold appointments in their Hospitals before entry into the Services. The holding of such an appointment is considered to be of the greatest value in the studenfs training, and a man who misses the opportunity to hold such a post may consider that he has lost a very valuable part of his education. Further, the man who has held a Hospital appointment will be of greater value to the Service than the man who has not.73. The Services already possess the power to second to Hospital appointments men who have entered; but it has not been possible to make use of this power to any considerable extent. The Medical Schools have to provide appointments for their own students as they qualify and it is difficult for them to reserve appointments for men who have left them and entered the Service. While the Schools are anxious to help the Services in any way they can, it is obviously impossible to expect them to give a preference to Service Officers over their own students in. the matter of these appointments.74. We recommend that service in a recognised hospital appointment held after qualification for a period of not less than one year before the date of entry into the Service should qualify the entrant for an antedate of his commission by not more than one year, provided that the interval between the termination of the hospital appointment and the date of entry into the Service shall not ordinarily exceed six months.75. We recommend further that the term &quot; resident &quot; appointment may include a period of not more than six months spent in a &quot;non-resident&quot; appointment immediately antecedent to, or following on, the holding of a resident appointment. The list of hospitals which are classed as &quot;recognised&quot; should be revised from time to time by the Joint Medical Services Committee.76. In the case of a candidate over the age limit the period of antedate may, if necessary, be deducted from his age at entry to bring him within the age limit.77. We are of the opinion that this antedate should not apply for purposes of gratuity to an officer serving on a temporary or short-service commission, and in no case should it apply unless at least three years&apos; actual service has been completed. We recommend that a temporary or short-service officer transferred to the permanent list should be granted this antedate under similar conditions to those applicable to candidates who may enter the permanent service direct.(7.) Reservation of Posts for Retired Officers.78. It is a serious matter for the Service medical officer that Avhen he is compulsorily retired which may be at the age of forty-eight to fifty-five (dependent on rank) if he holds a permanent commission, or after three, four or five years&apos; service if he holds a short-service commission he frequently finds it difficult to obtain suitable work in the civilian profession. To meet this point we have considered the question whether a certain number of medical posts in Government Departments should not be ear-marked for retired Service officers, whether they had held permanent or short-service commissions.79. The Ministry of Health, the Welsh Board of Health and the Scottish Board of Health employ between them about sixty Medical Officers of various grades at headquarters, and about fifty-five in &quot;outdoor&quot; posts. Candidates for appoint-ment must be practitioners of not less than ten years&apos; standing, with wide experience, for the headquarters posts, of public health work or preventive medicine, and, for the outdoor work, of general practice, especially among the industrial population.80. The requirements of the Health Departments rule out the possibility of the reservation of any large number of their posts for retired service doctors. For certain posts, however, which are principally concerned with preventive medicine the experience gained in the Service should be an excellent qualification.81. The Ministry of Pensions employ an administrative medical staff of about one hundred and fifty, and about two hundred and twenty-five medical officers of various grades (many of them on a part-time basis) in the Ministry&apos;s Institutions. There are also some twenty-two Medical Members of Pensions Appeal Tribunals.82. The retired Service doctor is eminently qualified for the duties of a Ministry of Pensions post, and in fact practically all the present holders have had Service experience, either as regular or as temporary officers. But the work of the Depart -ment is naturally decreasing, and considerable diminution of staff is looked for within the next few years. It is. unlikely that any new appointments will be necessary.
83. The Prisons Medical Service consists of about seventy Medical Officers, of whom about half are employed on a part-time basis. Other Government Depart-ments the Education Departments, the Home Office, the Customs and Excise, the Board of Inland Revenue and the Post Office employ in the aggregate about twenty-eight Medical Officers and Inspectors.84. &quot;We conclude that the intake of doctors to posts in Government Depart-ments for which the retired Service officer would be suitable is so small that reservation of such posts would not lead to any appreciable improvement of the position.85. The suggestion has been made that the Services should give certificates to every Officer who is compulsorily retired through no fault of his own, explaining the circumstances of retirement and setting forth any special qualifications which the Officer possesses in order to facilitate the obtaining of employment. The Committee is informed by the Medical Heads of the Services that such certificates are already freely given by them in response to applications from individual retired Officers who are seeking appointments for some special post. In their opinion this is preferable to the general system suggested above, inasmuch as they are able to speak with greater weight on the Officers qualification for the particular appoint-ment in question. They do not advise any change, and in this we are in agreement with them.(ii.) Applicable particularly to the Royal Navy.(1.) Grant of Marriage Allowance, and of Passage Money to Officers&apos;- Wives and Families.86. Representations have been made to us by several witnesses, particularly the representatives of the British Medical Association, that the married Naval Surgeon is at a serious disadvantage financially in comparison with the married officer of the Royal Army Medical Corps or the Royal Air Force Medical Branch, in that he is not entitled to marriage allowance, nor to married quarters, nor, unless he is posted to a shore appointment abroad for a definite term of years, to any contribution towards the travelling expenses of his wife and family on a change of station.87. The general question of a marriage allowance for Naval Officers was the subject of a Cabinet decision last summer, and we have, therefore, felt precluded from considering this representation.(2.) Institution of Professional Courses.88. It has been impressed on us from all sides that the Naval Surgeon&apos;s chief complaint is that his opportunities for professional work are limited. Further, the extent of the opportunities at present existing is not generally recognised outside the Service.89. We consider that the following alterations in the system of professional courses for Naval Surgeons should be made : (a.) General Courses. Every officer below the rank of Surgeon Captain, except when he has just vacated an appointment at a Home Hospital or is due to take his Promotion Course, should be appointed, if his services can be spared, once in every four years to the R.N. Hospital, Haslar, for a course of instruction of not less than four months&apos; duration in Clinical Medicine and Surgery and allied subjects. At the end of the course the officer should be appointed to one of the three main R.N. Hospitals Haslar, Chatham or Plymouth  to do duty there instead of being placed on Unemployed Time, unless or until he receives an appointment elsewhere.(b.) Specialist Courses. Every officer selected to hold a Specialist Appointment should undergo a course of not less than six months&apos; duration in his special subject, at a Civil Hospital in London or other teaching centre, and should subsequently undergo a course of three months&apos; duration m that subject every four years while he is employed as a Specialist.(c.) Senior Medical Officers&apos; Courses. The existing Senior Medical Officers&apos; Courses will to a large extent be superseded by the General and Specialist courses described above, and their number will, therefore, eventually be capable of reduction without detriment to the professional opportunities in the Service; but we do not recommend that any reduction should be made until the new courses proposed have been in operation for some years.[14469] D
90. The institution of these courses will necessitate an increase in establish-ment of about ten officers, at an estimated cost of  7,000 per annum. There will also be an ultimate addition of  3,500 per annum to the Retired Pay Vote. The Courses cannot be put into full operation until this increase has taken place, but every effort should be made to inaugurate the system as early as possible.(3.) Increase in Specialists&apos; Allowances.91. We recommend that the number of Specialist Officers&apos; appointments should be increased from the existing forty-six to sixty, the new appointments to include Specialist posts in Medicine, Surgery, Radiology and Hygiene; and we consider, further, that the allowance payable to the holders of Specialist Officers&apos; appointments should be increased from 2s. 6d. to 5s. a day. The cost of the increase in the number of Specialists will be  640 per annum, and of the increase in the amount of the allowance  2,735 per annum.(4.) Increase in the Establishment of Surgeon Captains.92. We recommend that four Surgeon Captains&apos; posts should be added, to the establishment of this ran&quot;k, which is at present sixteen. Two of the holders should be employed as Professors of Medicine and Surgery respectively at Haslar, on instructional duties connected with the General Courses described in section II. (D.) (ii.) (2.) (paragraph 89); the third as Director of Medical Studies, Medical School, R.N. College, Greenwich, and the fourth as second in charge of the R.N. Hospital, Malta. This allocation will enable the margin of two Surgeon Captains to be main-tained, both of whom will continue to be on half-pay. We have considered other posts which may be said to have a claim for a Surgeon Captain to be appointed, e.g., Senior Medical Officer, R.N. Hospital, Portland, but we consider that the present disposition of the establishment of sixteen, together with the allocation recommended, will prove to be the most advantageous distribution of the proposed new establishment of twenty.93. The grading of the four posts as Surgeon Captains&apos; appointments is, in our opinion, fully justified by the nature of the duties. In making the recommenda-tion We have also borne in mind the desirability of increasing the opportunities for the promotion of Surgeon Commanders, thereby benefiting the Service by the retention in it of selected officers, and affording a stimulus to zealous service.94. The cost of this addition to the establishment is  3,300 per annum. There will also be an ultimate addition of  4,700 per annum to the Retired Pay Vote.(5.) Grant of Additional Seniority for Professional Merit.95. We recommend that the present arrangements for accelerated promotion to Surgeon Commander be retained. Accelerated promotion is granted on the results of the examination for promotion to that rank on the following scale :- Total marks obtained. Increase of Seniority.85 per cent. ... ... ... ...      18 months.75 per cent. ... ... ... ...      12 months.This provision is a direct encouragement of ability in Naval Medical Officers, and we consider it desirable to retain it.(6.) Grant of Charge Pay.96. Up to 1919, Charge Pay existed in the Naval Medical Service, but it was abolished on the introduction of the new rates of pay. We recommend that Charge Pay should be granted to officers in charge of hospitals and sick quarters on the following scale : Surgeon Rear-Admirals and Surgeon Captains ... 10s. a day. Surgeon Commanders ... ... ...        5s. a day.The cost of this proposal is&apos; 1,500 per annum.(iii.) Applicable particularly to the Royal Army Medical Corps.(1.) Increase of Pay.97. The evidence from the Medical Schools on the subject of the pay of the Royal Army Medical Corps officer has naturally varied.   There has been little
criticism of the commencing rate, which, compares favourably with the current market rate for assistants in private practice. Criticism has been mainly directed to the rates at the age at which a doctor may expect to marry, and at which, in civil life, he would have set up in practice on his own account or have finished paying for a partnership. Some witnesses considered that the present rates at the intermediate ages are good enough, and have advised us against any alteration; others have thought that a few small increases would do a great deal to meet grievances; others again have urged that the market value of the doctor has increased, that the modern student, though not necessarily more mercenary in his outlook, looks further ahead than the student of ten or twenty years ago, and that in consequence a considerable increase is necessary to attract candidates. It is noticeable that some of the Schools which have been profitable recruiting grounds in the past Edinburgh, Glasgow and Dublin are those in which, to judge from the evidence, the question of remuneration is least regarded; the representatives of Leeds, Manchester, Birmingham and Belfast emphasised the modern studenfs insistence on a high rate of remuneration; the representatives of the London Hospitals were divided in their opinions.98. We have no doubt that the opinions of these witnesses were only advanced after consultation with their students; but the very fact that so many different opinions have been expressed leads us to the conclusion that in the evaluation of their evidence there is a personal factor to be reckoned with. A man who gives up his life to teaching is ex hypothesi a scholar, and interested mainly in the progress of medical science, and the fact that he has adopted an unremunerative career in itself indicates that monetary considerations do not appeal to him. Such a man would probably be the first to admit that his personal predilections must tend to colour his estimate of the students outlook. On the other hand, the successful consultant, making a large income, naturally tends to under-estimate the effect of an increase which would represent merely a negligible fraction of his own earnings. The personal factor must so largely affect all evidence on this point that it might be dangerous to attach too much importance to individual expressions of opinion. It is natural, however, that in the case of Schools with a small output readily absorbed locally the students expectation is apt to be higher than in the case of big Schools, like Edinburgh and Glasgow, with a large exportable surplus.99. The representatives of the British Medical Association urge the improve-ment of conditions so as to remove the grievances of officers already in the Service; they do not criticise the initial rates; and they are naturally more interested in the treatment of their existing members than in the fate of merely potential members. At the same time in their opinion the present and prospective pay of the officers of the Royal Army Medical Corps are insufficient either to secure a contented service or to attract recruits, and they regard it as of the first importance that there should be an increase in the rates of pay, especially in the senior ranks, if the former popularity of the Corps is to be restored.100.   We have obtained from the Board of Inland Revenue certain figures illustrating the earnings of Doctors in civil practices, and have heard evidence from the Board&apos;s officers upon them.   The figures cover some eighty of the seven hundred Tax Districts into which the country is divided.   They were collected for a different purpose; and it is doubtful, on the one hand, whether a due proportion of the industrial districts in which the civil practitioner makes a large income is included, and, on the other, whether the poorer country districts where earnings are small are adequately represented.   In any case, the &quot; Harley Street element&quot; is probably over-represented.   They include women as well as men, and, in so far as they do so, the average earnings will have been reduced.   The collection of the returns of even one per cent, of income-tax-paying Doctors, taken at random throughout the country, would necessitate an enormous amount of work; and as it is considered that the resultant picture would not differ to any large extent from that presented by the figures which are available we have not felt justified in adding, at a particularly busy time, to the Board&apos;s labours.   So far as they go the figures serve to indicate that the present emoluments of the Royal Army Medical Corps officer are not out of scale with the average earnings of the civil practitioner; but the conditions in the Service and in civil life are so different that close comparison of their respective financial advantages is impracticable.   For instance, the R.A.M.C. officer must necessarily undergo frequent changes of station, which involve considerable expense: he has to maintain a standard of living which is probably higher than that of the average civilian practitioner; and a great part of his life must be spent on foreign service. fl4469] d 2
101. In any case, so far as the student makes any comparison, it is not a comparison with the mathematical average of taxable income, which he has no means of knowing, but with the assumed income of a man Avhom he regards as typical and as neither exceptionally lucky nor exceptionally able.102. It is common ground that there are limits to the financial inducements which the State can offer, and that it therefore cannot compete with the income which a doctor with a large panel practice can earn in industrial areas. It may be argued that the present unpopularity of the E.A.M.C. as a career is a temporary phase, due in the main to (1) the widespread impression that the Service provides insufficient opportunities for professional work; (2) the still persistent post-war disinclination to enter the Fighting Services; (3) the ease with which medical students have hitherto been able to find other more attractive and more lucrative openings a position which may not continue; (4) the difficulties in the way of propaganda in the Schools; and (5) the definitely hostile attitude of the British Medical Association; and that any comparatively small increases of pay which may be offered will have little or no effect in attracting candidates in present circumstances. By this line of reasoning the conclusion may be reached that there is no justification for calling upon the taxpayer to meet the expense involved in increasing the basic rates in order to remove a difficulty which may be due only in a minor degree, to financial considerations, and may be transitory, without any real assurance that such increases as are practicable will secure results at all commensurate with the permanent burden imposed.103. On the other hand, although the Committee has not called for direct evidence from serving officers of the R.A.M.C., it has been made clear to them that discontent and a sense of grievance prevails in the Corps, which it is most desirable to remove, not only to prevent premature retirements, but also to attract recruits by the informal propaganda which emanates from a contented service. We have been informed that the discontent is most prevalent in the middle ranks of the Corps, those of Major and Lieutenant-Colonel, and a number of married officers of those ranks who have recently retired voluntarily informed the Director General that their sole reason for doing so was that they could no longer live on their pay in the Service and support and educate their families.104. The idea that the pay is inadequate is not, we understand, the sole factor in the production of this sense of grievance; the principal points may be summarised briefly as follows : i(1.) The inadequacy of the present rates of pay and the prospect of being retired on a pension too small to meet the necessities of life at an age when the chances of remunerative employment in civil life are small.(2.) The slow promotion to Lieutenant-Colonel, at present after twenty-three or twenty-four years&apos; service, in contrast to the rate prevailing during the war, especially in the case of those who entered the Corps above the average age, together with the resultant long period of service on the same rate of Major&apos;s pay, which carries no increment after fifteen years&apos; service.(3.) The small number of junior officers now serving, in consequence of the shortage of candidates, throws on senior officers much work Gf a kind usually performed by juniors.(4.) The frequency and expense of moves, which has been accentuated by the degree to which the Corps has fallen below its establishment.(5.) The shortening of the tour of home Service. This, we are informed, is at present from two to three years, which is considerably below the average home tour before the war. The requirements of India and other Commands abroad must be met in fidl by regular officers, who cannot be replaced, even temporarily, as at home, by retired pay officers and Civil medical practitioners.105. It is clear that some of these grievances are directly related to the failure of recruiting and would remedy themselves automatically if the ranks of the Corps could once more be filled and a normal flow of entrants re-established.106. On the question of rates of pay the following remarks may be made. Before 1919 the pay of the R.A.M.C., like that of the R.E. and other technical arms, was considerably in excess of that of the Cavalry, the R.A. and the Infantry. The underlying principles of the 1919 pay code was to level up the pay of the combatant arms towards that of the technical arms and the Staff.   The pay of everyone was
increased, but the increase was much greater in proportion in the Cavalry, the R.A. and the Infantry than in the R.A.M.C. and other technical arms, and the R.A.M.C. no doubt feel the loss of their former relative superiority, although they are not the only technical arm which is in this position. The R.A.M.C., with the Army Dental Corps and the R.A.V.C. as consequentials, are the only branch  or which the Army Council are now proposing an increase.107. We consider that a comparatively small increase of pay may have a large psychological effect,, since it will show that the grievances of the officers of the Corps are a matter of serious concern to the Government. Any increase at the present time, when the pay of other branches of the Services is being reduced, will have an effect altogether disproportionate to the cost. The assistance of the British Medical Association would undoubtedly be of great value to the Services, and the Association^ representatives have given their general approval to the moderate increases proposed by the War Office.108. We therefore recommend* that the rates of pay of officers of the R.A.M.C. should be revised as follows : Standard Daily Rates.Rank.LieutenantPresent.     *.    d. 1    2    0.Proposed.     s.   d.1   2   0.Captain  ...17   0.10.After 6 years&apos; service, After 8 years&apos; service, 1   8   0. 1 10   0.After 10 vears&apos; service, After 10 37ears&apos; service, 1 11   0. 1 12   6.mmMajor1 15   0. 1 17   6.After 15 years&apos; service, After 15 years&apos; service, 2   0   0. 2   2   6.After 18 years&apos; service, 2   5   0.After 20 years&apos; service. 2 10   0.Lieutenant-Colonel2 10   0. 2 17   6.After 20 years&apos; service, After 3 years in that rank, 2 12   6. 3   2   6.After 25 years&apos; service, 2 15   0.Colonel   ...	3   5	0.	3	10	0.Major-General	4 15	0.	4	15	0.tDirector General	...    2,500 per	annum	6	0	0.(consolidated).109.   The cost of these alterations is estimated at  47,500 per annum.(2.) Increase of Specialist Pay.110. It has been urged by several witnesses, including the representatives of the British Medical Association, that the discrimination in the amount of specialist pay which is 5s. a day for some appointments and 2s. 6d. for others which can hardly be regarded as less important is unjustifiable.111. A standardisation of specialist pay at the higher rate of 5s. is, in our opinion, justified on its merits, and must have, we think, a considerable propaganda value, since it is evidence of the importance attached to professional knowledge.112. We recommend that the rate of specialist pay for all specialist appoint-ments should be 5s. a day.  We understand that if this proposal is adopted it will* See footnote on the last pa^e of the Report.f See section II. (D.) (Hi.) (8.), paragraphs 126 to 130.
be possible to discontinue the present practice of granting temporary higher rank to officers holding certain appointments in the hygiene and pathology branches.113. The cost of this proposal is about  2,500 per annum, less  900 repre-senting the saving by the abolition of the grant of temporary rank.(3.) Increase of War Office Allowances.114. Officers of the RA.M.C. who hold appointments at the War Office as Assistant Directors General, Deputy Assistant Directors General or Assistant Directors receive, like officers of other arms who hold War Office appointments, an allowance of 2s. 9d. a day. But unlike other officers they almost invariably give up appointments carrying charge pay or specialist pay of 5s. a day when they are appointed to the War Office. It is of course important that the best qualified officers should be glad to accept War Office appointments. The real distinction between R.A.M.C. officers and officers of other arms employed at the War Office is that the former receive the pay of their rank, while the latter are graded and paid according to their posts.115. We recommend that the allowance granted to the R.A.M.C. officers who hold appointments at the War Office (one Assistant Director General, four Deputy Assistant Directors General and two Assistant Directors) should be increased to 5s. a day.116.   The cost of. this proposal is about  300 per annum.(4.) Increase of Gratuity on Retirement.117. The present rates of gratuity on retirement are those which were in force before 1919. They are  1,000 after eight and a half years&apos; service, of which five years have been in the rank of Captain;  1,800 after three years&apos; service as Major; and  2,500 after six years&apos; service as Major.118. It has been represented that, if an officer is not going to make service in the R.A.M.C. his life-work, eight and a half years is too long a period for him to serve before qualifying for the lowest rate of gratuity. At seven years&apos; service he will normally just have returned from his first tour of foreign service, but he will not have entered upon his Senior Course at the Royal Army Medical College. It is obviously wasteful to refuse an officer a gratuity until he has completed this course at the expense of the State which is, in effect, the existing practice.119. We recommend that the qualifying period for a gratuity of  1,000 on retirement should be reduced to seven years, and that the retiring gratuities for Majors should be increased to  2,800 after three years in that rank and  3,500 after six years in that rank.120.   The cost of this proposal is estimated at  6,300 per annum.(5.) Maintenance of Pension Rights.121. Under the regulations in force in 1914, and for very many years before, a Major, R.A.M.C., was entitled to a pension of  365 a year on retirement after twenty years&apos; service. Under the post-war regulations tlie system of calculating retired pay is altered, and the amount is now fixed by reference to two elements, a rank element and a service element. Service in unhealthy stations, such as the West Coast of Africa, counts double both for the qualifying period for retirement and for the &apos;&apos; service element&apos;&apos; of retired pay; but under the new regulations an officer who has served, say, four years on the West Coast, and who is therefore entitled to retired pay after sixteen years&apos; actual service, which counts as twenty, loses, by reason of the introduction of the rank element. Further, the retired pay fixed in 1919 is subject, as to twenty per cent., to variation in accordance with the cost of living, and a five and a half per cent, cut was made in 1924 on this account.122. The combined effect of those alterations has made it possible for a Major, R.A.M.C., in certain circumstances, even while the cost of living deduction is not more than five and a half per cent., to be entitled to a lower rate of pension than the  365 a year to which he looked forward on his entry into the Service under the 1914 regulations. Under the Pay Warrant, an officer who was serving as a Major on the introduction of the new regulations in 1919 retains the right to retired pay at the rate of  365 a year if he retires as a Major; but an. officer who was serving as a Captain or a Lieutenant in 1919 has no such right.123. The general effect of the 1919 alterations has been greatly to improve the retired pay of R.A.M.C. officers ; it is only in isolated cases that officers can get less under the new regulations than under the old.  But these isolated cases have caused
a very serious sense of injustice; we are informed that they appear to have been one of the principal causes of the opposition of the British Medical Association.124. We recommend, as a special measure, that all officers who were serving in the R.A.M.C. when the 1919 regulations came into effect should be granted a reserved right to pension at the old rate of  365 a year on retirement in the rank of Major after twenty years&apos; service.(6.) Pay of Royal Army Medical Corps Officers in India.125. It has been represented to us, notably in the evidence furnished by the British Medical Association, that considerable discontent has been caused in the Service, and recruitment has been correspondingly prejudiced, by the fact that in India the pay of Royal Army Medical Corps officers (for whom there is a special Indian scale), unlike that of other officers in both the military and civil spheres, has not been revised since 1919, and, in particular, that Royal Army Medical Corps officers do not receive marriage allowances corresponding to those now given in other branches of the Army. The question has been further examined by those of our members who are more directly concerned. Their conclusion, which we accept, is that, while reasons can be shown which justify the course of action so far taken by the Indian authorities, a revision of pay on the lines we have put forward in para-graph 108 must automatically bring the Indian rates again under review, and that one of the first considerations should then be the practicability of introducing new married rates in India. We desire to record this conclusion, while recognising that the final responsibility in this matter rests with the Indian authorities.(7.) Increase of the Emoluments of the Director General.126. The Director General at present receives consolidated pay at the rate of  2,500 per annum (standard rate : the actual rate at present in issue, after the five and a half per cent, deduction on account of the decrease in the cost of living has been made, is  2,362 10s.).127. Lieutenant-Generals in command receive  7 10.?. a day plus allowances  a total of about.  3,255 if married,  3,227 if unmarried; and Lieutenant-Generals not in command receive  6 a day plus allowances a total of about  2,607 if married,  2,543 if unmarried. (These figures of total emoluments are the actual rates at present issuable after the five and a half per cent, deduction on account of the decrease in the cost of living has been made.)128. It is regarded as a reflection on the importance of the R.A.M.C. that the Director General&apos;s emoluments should be less than those of other officers of his rank employed at the War Office.129. We recommend that the Director General should be granted the pay and allowances of his rank a Lieutenant-General not in command.130. The cost of this alteration will be  245 per annum if the Director General is married,  181 if he is unmarried.(iv.) Applicable particularly to the Royal Air Force.(1.) Guarantee of Permanent Commissions to Fifty per Cent, of Entrants on the Short-Service System.131. As has already been explained, the Royal Air Force recruit their Medical Branch by means of a short-service system, under which officers are granted commissions for a period of three years, extensible to five, and from these officers permanent officers are selected. The Air Ministry desire to be in a position to arrange that fifty per cent, of the entrants on the short-service system shall, so far as possible, be appointed to permanent commissions.132. The original arrangement was that not more than fifty per cent, of the establishment of the Medical Branch should hold permanent commissions. In 1925 this arrangement was modified by the concession that permanent commissions might be granted to a number of short-service officers not exceeding fifteen a year during the next five years, any deficiency below fifteen in the number granted in any one year being carried forward, on the condition that the question should be reconsidered m consultation with the Treasury at the end of five years if it had not been definitely decided before that time.133. Under the arrangement described above, the Air Ministry are in fact able at present to give permanent commissions to more than fifty per cent, of the officers serving on short-service commissions, but their desire to be able to give fifty per cent, of entrants the prospect of a permanent commission is not fully met.
134. We recommend that the Air Ministry be empowered so to arrange the proportion of permanent to short-service commissions within the approved establishment of total numbers as to admit of every officer entering on a short-service commission having a fifty per cent, chance, as nearly as practicable, of selection for a permanent commission.(2.) Increase of Pay.135. The considerations which affect the question of the increase of the pay of E.A.M.C. officers (section II. (D.) (iii.) (1.), paragraphs 97 to 109) apply in general to the similar question in regard to officers of the Medical Branch of the RAT. In one respect, however, there is a difference between the two Services to which we think it desirable to call attention, viz., that discontent with the conditions of their Service has not manifested itself among the officers at present serving in the Medical Branch of the R.A.F. This may be attributed to the fact that the Air Force is a young Service and that most of its senior officers obtained exceptionally rapid promotion during the war. This advantage is, however, a transitory one which will disappear when normal conditions are reached.136. On the other hand, the figures which we have quoted in paragraph 28 show that there is a very serious shortage in the number of candidates of the right quality coming forward for commissions in this Service. It is on this shortage rather than upon the existence of discontent among serving officers that the argument for an improvement in the conditions of service is based.137. We are impressed by this argument. We also attach considerable importance to the necessity of propaganda in the case of this young Service. It is apparent from the evidence that there is more ignorance, and at least as great need of propaganda, about the conditions of service in the Air Force as is the case in the other two Services. But propaganda without some concrete inducements which would bear comparison with the advantages proposed for the other Services would be worse than useless. The fact that the R.A.F. offer initially short service commissions only is in itself a handicap in competitive recruiting. We, therefore, recommend* that the scales of pay of officers of the R.A.F.&quot; Medical Branch should be revised as follows : Standard Daily Kates, Rank. Present. Proposed.    s.   d.      s.   d.Flying Officer ... ...       1   4   0. 1   4   0.Flight Lieutenant     ... ...      1   6   0. 1   6   0.After 2 years in that rank, 1   8   0. 1   8   0.After 4 years in that rank, 1 10   0. 1 10   0.Squadron Leader      ... ...      1 14   0. 1 14   0.After 2 years in that rank, 1 16   0. &apos; 1 18   0.After 4 years in that rank, 1 18   0. 2   0   0.After 6 years in that rank, 2   2   0. 2   4   0.After 8 years in that rank,- 2   8   0.After 10 years in that rank,- 2 10   0.Wing Commander     ... ...       2   6   0. 2 15   0.After 2 years in that rank, 2 10   0. 2 17   0.After 4 years in that rank, 2 12   0. 3   3   0.After 6 years in that rank, 2 14   0. -* See footnote on the last page of the Report.

The cost of this revision (omitting the pay of Air Vice-Marshal, with which we deal separately in section II. (D.) (iv.) (4.), paragraphs 142 to 144) is estimated to be approximately  6,000 per annum on the basis of the overhead establishment proposed for 1926-27. With the expansion of the Air Force some increase must be expected in future years.(3.) Increase of Gratuities.139. When a short-service officer is retired after five years&apos; service he isL under present arrangements, granted a gratuity of  650. The Air Ministry propose that this gratuity should be increased to  700, and should be calculated at  100 for each of the first two years of service,  150 for each of the third and fourth years, and  200 for the fifth year, only completed years being reckoned. The intention is not only to increase the attractiveness of the short-service system to possible candidates by the increase of the gratuity, but also to offer an inducement to officers to extend their short-service commissions from three to five years.140. The Air Ministry also desire that the gratuities payable to permanent officers on retirement when ineligible for retired pay should be improved; they propose that the sum of  1,250 payable after ten years&apos; service should be raised to  1,500, and that a gratuity of  2,500 after fifteen years should be substituted for the present gratuity of  2,000 after sixteen years.141. We recommend that these proposals be adopted. The absence of the necessary data makes it difficult to estimate accurately the cost, but we understand that the aggregate cost of the two proposals would probably not exceed  500 per annum.(4.) Increase of the Emoluments of the Director of Medical Services.142. The Director of Medical Services, R.A.F., is at present paid the consolidated salary of a Director at the Air Ministry, viz.,  2,000 per annum (standard rate), which is equivalent to  1,890 per annum (current rate). The appointment is at present held and probably will be held in the future by an Air Vice-Marshal, and it is desired to substitute the emoluments appropriate to that rank for the consolidated salary now m issue-143. No rate of pay has yet been fixed for an Air Vice-Marshal in. the Medical Branch; the Air Ministry propose that it should be the same as that of an Air Vice-Marshal in the General Duties Branch, i.e.,  5 a day. The allowances amount to  1 2s. 2d. a day for a married officer;  1 0s. Id. for a single officer.144. We recommend that the emoluments of the Director of Medical Services be at the rates for an Air Vice-Marshal as stated above when the appointment is held by an officer of that rank. In the event of an officer of lower rank being appointed his emoluments should be those of a Director as at present. The cost of this alteration at present rates, after the five and a half per cent, deduction on account of the decrease in the cost of living has been made, will be approximately  240 per annum if the Director is married, and  210 per annum if he is not married.(5.) Pay of Officers of fhe Medical Branch of the Royal Air Force in India.145. The considerations referred to in section II. (D.) (ii.) (6.), (paragraph 125) in regard to pay of R.A.M.C. officers in India, apply also to R.A.F. medical officers employed there; but the number of such officers is very small. We suggest that their case should be dealt with at the same time and on the same principles as that of R.A.M.C. officers in India.[14469]
(6.) Institution of an Initial Course of Instruction.146. When the Medical Branch of the Royal Air Force was originally formed, it was agreed that the training of officers on entry should be given at the Royal Armv Medical College at Millbank, and at the R.A.M.C. Depot, as in the case of Army entrants. In addition, training in matters specifically concerned with flying was to be given at the Medical Officers&apos; College of Instruction at Hampstead.147. In the event, a brief course of three weeks&apos; duration only has been given at Hampstead, but it has never been practicable to spare officers to take the four months&apos; Army course; and, indeed, a course of this length would not be appropriate for an officer who may serve for three years only. The arrangement with the War Office has, therefore, never been in operation.148. We recommend that an eight weeks&apos; course should be instituted for short-service officers on appointment. This course should cover not only professional subjects, but also the organisation of the Air Force. The institution of this course will not mean any addition to the establishment and will involve no increase of expenditure.(7.) Grant of Study Leave.149. The Air Ministry have authority at present to grant study leave only during the first six years of a Medical Officer&apos;s permanent service,, In the Medical Branch of the Navy, study leave may be granted at any time during the officers service.150. We regard the grant of such leave as of the first importance Both for increasing the efficiency of the Service and for popularising it among the keener medical students. We think it desirable that every officer who is suitable and anxious should take at least one general or specialist course before reaching the rank of Wing Commander.151. We recommend that the Air Ministry should have authority to grant study leave on full pajr to permanent officers at any time during the first sixteen years of their service; the amount of leave should, as heretofore, be limited to nine months in all. To allow for this arrangement four vacancies must be reserved in the Establishment to provide for officers on study leave. The cost of this arrangement, including non-effective charges, is estimated at  4,000 per annum.(E.) Matters of Internal Organisation and Discipline, (i.) Royal Navy.152. Reference has been made by witnesses to the fact that.a Naval Surgeon has no disciplinary authority over naval ratings; and that he cannot be appointed a member of a Court-Martial, even when the accused person is also a surgeon.153. These disabilities are common to all branches of the Naval Service except the Executive Branch, and we understand that any alteration would involve serious changes in the system of Naval Discipline and alterations in the Naval Discipline Act. We have no reason to believe that they are matters which cause irritation to the average medical officer in the Service, who is well acquainted with the traditions of the Navy.(ii.) Royal A rmy Medical Corps.154. We are informed that during the war, when Surgeon Generals were granted the substantive rank of Major-General, they were permitted, in common with General Officers of certain other technical Corps namely, the Royal Army Ordnance Corps, the Royal Army Veterinary Corps, and the Royal Army Pay Corps to wear the same distinctive badges in service dress uniform as other General Officers. Since the war, however, this privilege has been withdrawn, and the scarlet cap-bands and gorget patches have been replaced by those of a different colour. The war-time regulation was regarded as a distinct privilege, and the reversion to the previous system has caused real dissatisfaction among the officers of the Corps.155. The Director General is represented on the Army Council by the Adjutant General. For some reason there has been an impression that the Royal Army Medical Corps is therefore under the command of the Adjutant General, and consequently that the Director or Assistant Director of Medical Services of a formation is under the command of the Staff Officer representing the Adjutant General with that formation, although the latter may be of junior rank.156. A larger point than the relation of the Director General to the Adjutant General is his relation to the Army Council.   It has been suggested to us by the
representatives of the British Medical Association that the importance of the medical side in warfare has now been so amply demonstrated by experience that the Director General should be recognised as the Medical Adviser of the Army Council, and should be in a position to give his advice, unasked, on the medical aspects of strategical questions.157. The points mentioned in the preceding paragraphs are intimately connected with the organisation and disciplinary control of the Navy and the Army. They raise questions which we regard as outside our province. We accordingly make no recommendations on these matters; but we consider that everything possible should be done to remedy grievances and to remove misapprehensions, since we believe that in the aggregate these questions of status have a large effect.III. RECRUITMENT OF DENTAL OFFICERS.158. The importance, from the point of view of military efficiency, of the dental care of sailors, soldiers and airmen became very evident during the War. It is now generally accepted that it is economical to give thorough dental treatment to recruits on enlistment; extensive treatment is necessary in most cases. This recognition of the importance of dental care in military life is only an instance of the general tendency which has followed on the development of dental science.159. The Dental Services of both the Navy and the Army were organised in their present form during the War. The organisation corresponds generally with that of the Naval Medical Service and the R.A.M.C. The Royal Air Force has no separate Dental Service; its personnel are treated by members of the Army Dental Corps seconded for the purpose.160. As in the medical profession, so in the dental, the output of qualified men became very large four or five years after the end of the War. That phase has now passed; and the number of students is considerably reduced. The Services will in future have few candidates, unless conditions are improved so as to attract recruits. A fact which will undoubtedly operate to make the shortage more acute is that during the next few months the opportunities in civilian dental practice will be greatly improved by increased openings in insurance work.(A.) Royal Navy.(1.) Increase of Establishment.161. It has been represented to us that a minimum of one Dental Officer to every sixteen hundred of the total personnel is required, exclusive of provision for post-graduate courses, and a margin for sickness, leave, reliefs, &amp;c. We consider that this is a reasonable figure.162. Opportunities of promotion in the Naval Dental Service are at present practically non-existent. There is only one post of the rank of Surgeon Commander (D) (employed at the Admiralty), and forty-seven Surgeon Lieutenant-Commanders (D) and Surgeon Lieutenants (D). No doubt it would have been impossible to carry on the work with so small a number of higher posts if it were not for the fact that the Service is still young.163. We recommend that the establishment of Naval Dental Officers should be increased to sixty-four, to be comprised of the following ranks : 1 Surgeon Captain (D). 3 Surgeon Commanders (D). qq f Surgeon Lieutenant-Commanders (D). \ Surgeon Lieutenants (D).The cost of this proposal is estimated at  10,500 per annum. There will also be an ultimate addition of  7,000 per annum to the Retired Pay Vote.(2.) Institution of Post-Graduate Courses.164. In view of the continued progress of dental science, opportunities should be given for dental study. We recommend that arrangements should be made for at least four Dental Officers each twelve months to undergo a Post-Graduate Course. The? establishment recommended in paragraph 163 is, we think, sufficient to allow of this proposal being carried out. The cost of this proposal is estimated at  100 per annum.[14469] E 2
(B.) Army Dental Corps.165. The main ground for dissatisfaction among officers of the Army Dental Corps is that prospects of promotion are very small. The establishment of the Corps is one Lieutenant-Colonel (employed at the War Office as Inspector of Dental Services), eight Majors, and one hundred and twenty-three Captains and Lieutenants. Officers are promoted Captain after three and a half years&apos; service; but promotion to Major is by selection, and on account of the small number of the higher posts only one officer in ten ever reaches that rank.(1.) Introduction of Time Promotion to Major.166. We recommend that officers of the Army Dental Corps, who satisfy the necessary qualifying tests and are favourably reported on, should be automatically promoted to the rank of Major after twelve years&apos; service. This alteration will put the officer of the Army Dental Corps on the same footing as the R.A.M.C. Officer. The cost is estimated at  12,500 per annum, at the rates of pay recommended in paragraph 169.(2.) Increase in the Number of the Higher Posts.167. We recommend that the Inspector of Dental Services at the War Office should have the rank of Colonel; and that the establishment of Lieutenant-Colonels should be four, of whom one would be allotted to the R.A.F. We understand that the War Office propose that only three Lieutenant-Colonels should be appointed at once : the fourth when the officer to be promoted has served five years in the rank of Major.  The cost of this increase is estimated at  2,000 per annum.(3.) Increase of Pay.168. Proposals for the increase of the pay of the Army Dental Corps are based on three grounds : (a) the merits of the work; (&amp;) the general level of emoluments in the civilian profession; and (c) the comparison with the revised rates of pay for the R.A.M.C. recommended in paragraph 108 of this Report. The evidence which we have obtained from the Board of Inland Revenue goes to show that the present pay of the Service Dentist is not out of scale with the earnings of the civilian Dentist, and that no drastic alteration to the present rates is necessary. The third reason is the one which appears to us to be conclusive.169. We accordingly recommend* that the rates of pay of officers of the Army Dental Corps should be revised as follows : Standard Daily Rates.Rank.	Present.		Proposed.

(2.), paragraph 167.
(4.) Introduction of Charge Pay.,   -r^70; i1? Iiew of.the specialised and technical character of the work atthe Dental Laboratories, Aldershot, where all the dentures for the Home Establish-ments are made and the training of the other ranks of the Army Dental Corps is earned out, we recommend the grant of Charge Pay to the Officer in Charge, at the rate of 5s a day if he is of the rank of Captain and 2s. 6d. a day if he is of the rank of Major.   The cost of this proposal will be  91 or  45 per annum(5.) Increase of Gratuity on Retirement.171. We recommend that the gratuities payable on retirement after fifteen and eighteen years&apos; service should be increased from  1,800 and  2,500 to  2,000 and  3,000 respectively. The cost of this proposal is estimated at  1,500 per annum.(6.) Introduction of a Short-Service System.172. We have considered the possibility of the introduction of a short-service system of recruitment for officers of the Army Dental Corps.173. This suggestion would appear to have much to recommend it, as there would not seem to be the same need as in other branches of the Army for a large number of senior officers to deal with administrative work, while a short-service system lessens the number of higher posts which must be provided to secure an adequate flow of promotion. Further, we are informed that a dentist has to incur considerable expense in order to set himself up in civilian practice; apart from the purchase of the practice itself, the cost of the equipment may amount to something like  750 to  1,000. It might appear probable, therefore, that a system under which a newly qualified dental surgeon could enter the Service for three or five years, with the prospect of a substantial gratuity at the end of that period, would prove attractive. Moreover, despite doubts which were expressed in the evidence tendered by the British Dental Association, it appears to us that the clinical experience which a man can obtain in the Services does not very greatly differ from that which he would gain in civil life, and that such experience should prove of value to him in civilian practice afterwards. We understand, also, that no difficulty is experienced in obtaining candidates for the School Dental Service, although the prospects of advancement are negligible.174. On the other hand, we are impressed by the fact that it is found by experience of that part of the Army Dental Corps which serves with the Army that an Officer&apos;s capacity for the work required in the Army grows with the experience. Further, increasing value is attached to close co-operation between Medical and Dental Officers in the treatment of cases in Hospital, and the need for effective co-ordination and inspection of the work of the widely scattered dental centres calls for the services of senior and experienced officers.175. After careful consideration we do not recommend the introduction of a short-service system of recruitment for Dental Officers serving with the Army. If in the future, however, it should be considered desirable to create a separate Dental Branch for the Royal Air Force, the Committee feels that, in this case, the arguments for the constitution of such a branch on a short-service basis, comparable to that now obtaining in its Medical Branch, carry much weight and would deserve careful consideration.IY.-RECRUITMENT OF VETERINARY OFFICERS.176. The Army is the only one of the three Services which employs Veterinary Officers.(1.) Increase of Pay.177. We consider that a revision of the scale of pay of officers of the R.A.V.C. should be made in consequence of the increases recommended for officers of the R.A.M.C. in paragraph 108 of this Report. We accordingly recommend* that the pay of officers of the R.A.V.C. should be revised as follows : * See footnote on the last page of the Report.

Increase of Gratuity on Retirement.178. An officer of the R.A.V.C. is at present granted oh retirement after ten years&apos; service a gratuity of  1,000.   This was the rate in force before 1919.179. We recommend that gratuities of  800,  1,800 and  2,500 be granted on retirement after seven, fifteen and eighteen years&apos; service respectively. The cost of this proposal is estimated at  1,000 per annum.Y. RECRUITMENT OF NURSES.180. It is, in our opinion, of the utmost importance that women of what may be called the officer type should be recruited for the Nursing Services. The value of having a permanent nucleus of trained women of this class became abundantly evident during the War, when the Nursing Services were expanded very greatly. Even in peace, the duties of a Service Nurse are comparable with those of an officer; she has, for instance, to undertake the training of medical orderlies. We cannot accept the suggestion that the Services must be content in future with nurses of a lower class than they have had in the past.181. All three Services have for some years experienced the greatest difficulty in obtaining recruits of the right type. An obvious explanation which, we think, accounts for a great part of the difficulty is that since the War there are many more openings for women in professions of all kinds. Before the War many &quot;women adopted the nursing profession as a vocation; they were not remunerated on a business basis, since they did not demand anything more than just enough to live on.182. The Civil Hospitals, as well as the Services, have found great difficulty in obtaining candidates of the old type. They have adopted various methods to increase the attractions of the work, with the result that there are wide distinctions between the conditions of service in different Hospitals, and it is difficult to ascertain the present market value of the trained nurse. The difficulty is increased by the fact that Hospitals of some kinds have been forced to adopt a lower standard of service, while the larger teaching Hospitals are in a special position, since they offer rather a training ground from which better-paid posts can be obtained than a permanent career.
183. The War Office and the Air Ministry have collected information as to the pay of Nurses in a large number of representative Civil Hospitals, from which the following average figures have been compiled : Staff Nurses           ... ... ...  65/ 70Sisters        ....... ... ...  80/ 120Assistant Matrons   ... ... ...  116/ 128Matrons........ ... ...  200/ 400                  ;184. We are assured, and are reasonably satisfied, that the recommendations which we make in the following paragraphs will secure a sufficient supply of candidates of the desired class, and also that the varying proposals for the three Services will not give any one of them an undue advantage over the others.(A.) The Queen Alexandra^ Royal Naval Nursing Service.185. The Naval Nursing Service has not, in fact, suffered from any shortage in establishment; on the contrary, there is at present a considerable waiting list of candidates. But the candidates are not of the best type, and we are satisfied that some improvement in conditions is necessary. The causes of the discontent in the Service, and the reasons for the mediocre standard of the present recruits, are, we think, (a) the lack of prospects of promotion, and (b) the absence of difference in status between senior and junior Sisters.186. In the Queen Alexandra^ Imperial Military Nursing Service the two highest officers the Matron-in-Chief and the Principal Matron are employed in administrative posts in the War Office. Similarly, the Matron-in-Chief of the Princess Mary&apos;s Royal Air Force Nursing Service is employed at the Air Ministry. There is no arrangement of this kind in the Naval Nursing Service ; all the members of the Service are employed in hospital posts.(1.) Increase in Establishment.187. We recommend that the establishment of the Queen Alexandra^ Royal Naval Nursing Service should be increased by the addition of one Head Sister, one Superintending Sister, and four Nursing Sisters. The Head Sister will be employed in the R.N. Hospital, Malta, which has recently become of greater importance, on account of the increase in the strength of the Mediterranean Fleet; the Super-intending Sister in Shotley Sick Quarters; and the four Nursing Sisters will provide a margin for reliefs. The addition of the two higher posts will also improve the prospects of promotion, and the increase in the number of Nursing Sisters will, during periods when no reliefs are being carried out, help to mitigate a grievance felt by Superintending Sisters and the senior Nursing Sisters, in that they have to perform night duty. The cost of this increase in establishment will be  630 per annum on the present rates of pay, or  726 on the new rates recommended in paragraph 188.(2.) Increase of Pay.188. We recommend that the pay of Queen Alexandra^ Royal Nursing Service should be revised as follows : Rank.Nursing Sister Superintending Sister... Head Sister ...Present Scale. 60- 5- 85  95- 5- 135  170- 10- 200Proposed Scale. 65- 5 (biennially)- 110  120- 10- 180 . 225- 12- 275 &apos;The cost of these increases is estimated at  941 per annum for the new establishment proposed in paragraph 187, or  845 for the present establishment.(3.) Grant of Charge Pay.189. We recommend that Charge Pay at the rate of Is. Qd. a day be granted to the Senior Nursing Sister in each establishment where no Head Sister or Superintending Sister is employed. The cost of this proposal is estimated at  27 per annum.
(4.) Institution of Voluntary Retirement on Gratuity.190. We recommend that Sisters should be permitted to retire voluntarily with the following gratuities : .... - ,  After 10 years&apos; service       ... ... ...      250After 15 years&apos; service       ... ... ...      400After 20 years&apos; service       ... ... ...      500The cost of this proposal is estimated at  500 per annum.(5.) Age of Retirement.191. We recommend that the age for retirement on pension should be as follows: Nursing Sister      ...         ...         ... ...        50Superintending Sister         ...          ... ...        52Head Sister          ...         ...         ... ...        55(6.) Revision of Retired Pay.192. We recommend that the service element of retired pay should be  3 for each year of service up to twelve years&apos; service, and  6 for each year of service thereafter; and that a rank element should be added in respect of service as Head Sister or Superintending Sister on the following basis : Addition for each \r   -       * * iRank from which                                         completed year&apos;s maximum totalretired.                                                service in that addition forrank.rank.Head Sister       ... ... ...  12  108Superintending Sister       ... ...  6  60Nursing Sister    ... ... ... Nil Nil193. The overriding maximum rates of retired pay must also be revised in consequence of the alteration recommended in the preceding paragraph. We recommend that they should be as follows : &apos; Head Sister ... ... ... ...      200Superintending Sister ... ... ...      160Nursing Sister       ... ... ... ...      105194. The cost of the reduction of the age for retirement and of the revision of retired pay is estimated at  400 to  500 per annum.(B.) The Queen Alexandra^ Imperial Military Nursing Service, and the Queen Alexandra^ Military Families&apos; Nursing Service.195. There is a considerable shortage of candidates for the Army Nursing Services. This is the more serious at present, since it has been agreed by the Army Council and the Government of India that the Home and Indian Services should be amalgamated. To carry out this policy it is necessary that the strength of the Army Nursing Services should be approximately doubled, and a large number of recruits must be obtained. We are assured that the new prospects opened by the amalgamation will be attractive to the members of the Army Nursing Services.196. Certain proposals were made by the War Office in 1924 for the improve-ment of conditions in the Army Nursing Services. Of these proposals some were approved by the Treasury, others were refused; but the Army Council have been unable to put into effect those which were approved. We have therefore considered the existing conditions, which are the same as those which were in force before 1924; and some of the alterations which we recommend in the following paragraphs have already received Treasury sanction.(1.) Introduction of Time Promotion.197. Under existing arrangements a Staff Nurse when appointed to either of the Army Nursing Services receives  60 per annum and rises by increments of  2 10s. to  65.   It is estimated that normally ten years must elapse before she is promoted.
3198. We recommend that a system of time promotion should be introduced under which a Staff Nurse may be promoted to the rank of Sister (Q.A.I.M.N.S.) or Sister-in-Charge (Q.A.M.F.N.S.) after completing three years&apos; efficient service, provided that she is fully qualified to hold the higher rank.(2.) Increase of Pay.199. We recommend that the pay of the Queen Alexandra^ Imperial!Military Nursing Service and the Queen Alexandra^ Military Families&apos;Nursing Service should be revised as follows : Proposed Scale. 65- 2 10s.- 70Rank.Staff Nurse SisterSister-in-Char Matron Principal Matron Matron-in-ChiefgejPresent Scale. 60- 2 10s.- 65  75- 5- 85 75- 5 (bieimially)- l 10 115- 10- 185  13O- 10- 200 260- 12- 296  275- 12- 323 425- 15- 470  450- 15- 495The cost of the introduction of time&apos; promotion and of these increases in pay is estimated at  3,400 to  3,900 per annum.(3.) Annual Allowance for Uniform Abroad.200. We recommend that members of the Queen Alexandra&apos;s Imperial Military Nursing Service and the Queen. Alexandra^ Military Families&apos; Nursing Service who are entitled to draw an annual allowance for uniform should receive an increase of fifty per cent, in the allowance on being ordered abroad to stations or countries with a tropical or semi-tropical climate, including the Mediterranean stations. The existing allowances, both at home and abroad, are  20 for the first year of service,  5 for the second year of service and  10 for each subsequent year of service. The cost of this increase is estimated at  385 per annum.(4.) Grading for Allowances of the Matron-in-Chief, the Principal Matronand Matrons.201. At present the upper ranks of the Army Nursing Services are graded for allowances under section 1, Allowance Regulations, as follows : Rank. Class. Equivalent Officer rank.Matron-in-Chief ... 9                       MajorPrincipal Matron ... 11                       CaptainMatron          ... ... 13                       LieutenantWe consider that the importance of the duties of these members of the Army Nursing Services justify a higher classification. The improvement is one of status rather than of financial considerations; the grading governs questions of precedence as well as the rate of allowances.202. We accordingly recommend that these ranks of the Army Nursing Services should be classified as follows : 1Rank. Glass. Equivalent Officer grade.Matron-in-Chief ... 5 ColonelPrincipal Matron ... 8 Lieutenant-ColonelMatron ... ... 10 MajorThe cost of this proposal will be small, since only the Matron-in-Chief and the Principal Matron are normally on the lodging list.(5.) Institution of Voluntary Retirement on Gratuity.203. Under the existing regulations a member of the Army Nursing Services retired on account of unfitness for the duties of her appointment may, if not eligible for retired pay (for which she becomes qualified at the age of fifty or after twenty years&apos;&apos; service), be granted a gratuity of one month&apos;s pay for each year of service. There is no provision for voluntary retirement on gratuity. [14469]
204. We recommend that members of the Army Nursing Services should be permitted to retire voluntarily with the following gratuities :  After 10years&apos;service        ... ... ...      250After 15 years&apos; service        ... ... ...      400No estimate of the cost of this proposal can be made. It is anticipated that it will be very small.(6.) Revision of Retired Pay.205. The existing rate of retired pay is based on service and is  3 for each year of service. We recommend that a rank element in respect of service in the grades of Sister (Q.A.I.M.N.S.) or Sister-in-Charge (Q.A.M.F.N.S.) should be added, on the basis of  2 for each year of service over twelve in that grade, with a maximum of  30.206. Service in excess of three years in the grade of Staff Nurse should, in the case of Nurses now serving, count as service in the grade of Sister or Sister-in-Charge, for purposes of the rank element of retired pay.207. The overriding maximum rate of retired pay for Sisters and Sisters-in-Charge should be increased to  105 in consequence of the alteration recommended in paragraph 205.208.   The cost of this proposal is estimated at  500 per annum(G.) The Princess Mary&apos;s Royal Air Force Nursing Service.209. Great difficulty is being experienced in obtaining a sufficient number of suitable candidates for the Princess Mary&apos;s Royal Air Force Nursing Service, as for the Naval and Army Nursing Services; and a considerable number of temporary members of the Service have resigned within the last year or two, giving in most cases as their reasons the uncertain prospects in the Service and the more lucrative positions to be obtained in civil life.210. As in the case of the Army Nursing Services, certain improvements in conditions have recently been approved by the Treasury, but have not yet been put into effect; and the recommendations which we make in the following paragraphs include certain proposals which have already received Treasury sanction.(1.) Introduction of Time Promotion.211. We recommend that, as in the case of the Army Nursing Services, a system of time promotion should be introduced under which a Staff Nurse may be promoted to the rank of Sister after completing three years&apos; efficient service, provided that she is fully qualified to hold the higher rank.(2.) Increase of Pay.212. We recommend that the pay of the Princess Mary&apos;s Royal Air Force Nursing Service should be revised as follows: Bank. Staff Nurse ... SisterSenior Sister MatronMatron-in-ChiefPresent Scale. 60- 2 10s.- 65  75- 5- 85  85- 5- 95- 115- 10- 185  310- 15- 355Proposed Scale. 65- 2 10s.- 70  75- 5 (biennially)- 110  110- 5 (biennially)- 120  130- 10- 200,  330- 15- 375The initial cost of the application of these increases to the present staff is estimated at  430 per annum. The cost of the introduction of time promotion, as recommended in paragraph 211, and of these increases in pay at the mean of the scales is estimated at  1,940 per annum.(3.) Annual Allowance for Uniform Abroad.213. As in the case of the Army Nursing Services, we recommend that members of the Princess Mary&apos;s Royal Air Force Nursing Service should receive an increase
(4.) Allowances of the Matron-in-Chief and Matrons.215. We recommend that the following revised scales of allowances should be introduced for the Matron-in-Chief and Matrons: . Light and Fuel.Bank.

The cost of this proposal is estimated at  40 per annum.(5.) Special  Pay  for  Nurses  in  Charge   of  the  Families  and  MassageDepartments.216. Members of the R.A.F. Nursing Service who are appointed to take charge of the Families Departments of R.A.F. Hospitals must possess the certificate of the Central Midwives Board. We recommend that this special qualification should be recognised by the grant of special, pay at the rate of  20 per annum. The number of nurses affected is two one at Haiton and one at Cranwell.217. Members of the R.A.F. Nursing Service who are appointed for Massage duties in R.A.F. Hospitals must possess the certificates in Massage and Medical Electricity of the Chartered Society of Massage and Medical Gymnastics. We recommend that this special qualification should be recognised by the grant of special pay at the rate of  15 per annum for the first three years of full employment on these duties, then rising by  5 per annum to  30 per annum. The number of nurses affected is four one at each of the three home Hospitals and one at Baghdad.218.   The cost of these proposals is estimated at  140 per annum.(6.) Institution of Voluntary Retirement on Gratuity.219. As in the case of the Army Nursing Services, we recommend that members of the Princess Mary&apos;s Royal Air Force Nursing Service should be permitted to retire voluntarily with the following gratuities :  After 10 years&apos; service    ... ... ... 250After 15 years&apos; service    ... ... ... 400No estimate of the cost of this proposal can be made. It is anticipated that it will be very small.(7.) Revision of Retired Pay.220. As in the case of the Army Nursing Services, the existing rate of retired pay is based on service and is  3 for each year of service. We recommend that a rank element in respect of service in the grades of Sister or Senior Sister should be added, on the basis of  2 for each year of service over twelve in the grade of Sister, with a maximum of  30, and  3 for each year of service in the grade of Senior Sister, with a maximum of  40.221. Service in excess of three years in the grade of Staff Nurse should, in the case of Nurses now serving, count as service in the grade of Sister for purposes of the rank element of retired pay.[14469] &apos; Gof fifty per cent, in the allowance for uniform to which they are entitled on being-ordered abroad to stations or countries with a tropical or semi-tropical climate including the Mediterranean stations.   The existing rates of allowance are the same as those in force in the Army Nursing Services.214.   The cost of this proposal is estimated at  250 per annum.
222. The overriding maximum rates of retired pay should be increased to  105 for Sisters and  115 for Senior Sisters in consequence of the alteration proposed in paragraph 220.223.   The cost of this proposal is estimated at  250 per annum.VI. SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS.224.

229. In concluding our report we desire to emphasise our deep sense of gratitude to our Secretaries, Mr. Longhurst and Mr. Woodburn. They have afforded us invaluable assistance throughout our enquiry into a complicated subject; and our task has been greatly facilitated by their unfailing resourcefulness and industry.N. F. WARREN FISHER (Chairman). H. E. FASS.* H. G. TURKEY. JOSEPH CHAMBERS. CHARLES WALKER.* W. B. LEISPIMAN, D.G., A.M.S. R. PATERSON. D. MUNRO. J. A. WEBSTER. S. F. STEWART.     . S. K. BROWN. L. G. BROCK.C. Longhurst    &quot;1 0     .   .Y Secretaries.D. B. Woodburn j2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1, April 30, 1926.We have reached the conclusion set out in paragraph 102 of the Report. We do not nnd any sufficient justification for the proposed increases in the basic rates of pay of the R.A.M.C. and the R.A.F. Medical Service, and we are not satisfied that they will have any appreciable effect on the attitude of students towards these bervices. We are, therefore, unable to concur in the recommendations made in S^afnnP 1 (increase m the rates of pay of officers of the R.A.M.C.-cost  47,500 per annum) and in paragraph 137 (increase in the rates of pay of officers ot the RA.F. Medical Service-cost  6,000 per annum); or in those made in paragraph 168 (increase in the rates of pay of officers of the Army Dental Corps-cost  2^500 per annum) and in paragraph 177 (increase in the rates of pay of officers of the R.A.V.C. cost  1,000 per annum), which we regard as consequential upon the proposed increases in the rates for the R.A.M.C. and the R.A.F. Medical Service.
