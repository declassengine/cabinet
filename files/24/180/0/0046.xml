What effect our diplomatic support of the Amir will have at Moscow must depend on the state of our general relations with Russia at the moment, and I need not pursue that point. But it brings me to the larger question which lies behind the immediately possible crisis over Urta Tagai, and which is raised in paras. 6 and 7 of the Ministers despatch. If Russian policy in Asia is as the available evidence leads me to believe that of hemming India iu with a circle of Bolshevik States, and, if northern Afghanistan is destined to be the next region to be drawn into the orbit of the U.S.S.R., what is to be the policy of Great Britain ? We have no commitments to the Amirj but can we, in the interests of the safety of India, allow the Russian frontier in effect to be pushed forward to the Hindu Kush? The answer presumably is that the integrity of Afghanistan is still as essential to India as it ever was. If this is so, I think we should consider in good time the means to be adopted to secure it.The difficulties in the way of local military action are those which I have already indicated, and the defence of Afghanistan by Great Britain on the Afghan frontier has never been seriously considered. It is true that in 1905 the Amir Habibullah proposed a military alliance, and that Lord Kitchener supported the idea. But, though Afghan relations formed at that moment the subject of acute controversy between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Government of India, there was perfect unanimity between them as to the impracticability of any such measure. The local conditions have not changed materially since 1905 ; but there can be little doubt that in India itself it Avould be impossible to carry any policy involving largely increased military expenditure through the Legislative Assembly; while in the present tension of Hindu-Moslem feeling a military alliance Avith a Moslem neighbour who is popularly regarded as one of the props of the Indian Moslem community would add to our internal difficulties.Apart from military action, however, it is probable, though not certain, something can be done to help the Amir to consolidate his hold over the country, and so render the execution of the supposed Russian plan more difficult. The Military Attache found that Afghan Turkistan was satisfactorily under the control of the Central Government. There was no obvious anti-Government feeling, and all classes seemed to dislike the Russians, and to care nothing about Bolshevism. &quot; What, however, the disreputable classes do know and do care about is that a change of regime means a revolution, and a revolution means an opportunity to plunder those better off than themselves. It is from this class that danger was feared.&quot; This is probably true of the country generally. Telegraphs, telephones, roads, and eventually railways, will all help to reduce this danger to a minimum (if not pressed forward with undue zeal), and will, moreover, make it easier for us to give the Amir military support in case of need. But they will cost money. The policy of a &quot; subsidy in kind &quot; has already been approved in principle, and it may be that some extension of it may be possible and desirable.But while such measures may consolidate the rest of Afghanistan they will be of little avail in the north, owing to the difficulty of communications over the Hindu Kush the Military Attache regards the possibility of a motor road as remote and to the fact that the region being geographically in the Russian sphere it is certain that no British supported improvements will be possible there, and that such improvements as are carried out will be carried out by Russians and will be used to extend Russian influence. And the question which presents itself is whether in the last resort we really have any more effective means of ensuring . the integrity of Afghanistan against Bolshevik Russia than the diplomatic means which secured it against Imperial Russia, if the Russian Government are given clearly to-understand that a military occupation of Afghan Turkestan or its absorption into the U.S.S.R., in whatever way effected and however disguised, will be regarded as a casus belli, the danger may be reduced to its proper proportions.I have put these propositions broadly and somewhat dogmatically merely for the sake of brevity. What I would suggest is that the whole question should be remitted to the Committee of Imperial Defence for early examination and report, and that if, in the meantime, a crisis arises over the island and the Amir asks for help, Sir F. hlumphrys should be authorised to promise him diplomatic support of His Majesty&apos;s Government provided that he follows his advice and refrains from active hostilities.India Office, 17th June 1920.BIRKENITEA I).
