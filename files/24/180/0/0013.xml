IT&apos;HIS DjC GUMS NT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT) .CONFIDENTIAL. COPY NO.;j\213(26K C A B I  NET.THE  COAL SITUATION.LETTER CONVEYING GOVERNMENT ANSWER TO REPLY OF THE MINERS nFEDERATION TO&quot; PROPOSALS OF THE GOVERNMENT .(See al3Q CP.  202(26)  and CP,210 (26) . )10, Downing Street, S.W. 22nd May,   1926.Dear Sir,I am desired by the Prime Minister to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 20th May, in vhich you inform him that you are unable to agree to the terms which, on behalf of the Government, he had put forward for your consideration BThese terms were based upon the report of the Ro?ral Commission, and contained a statement in detail of the immediate steps that the Government proposed towards the fulfilment of their undertaking to play their part in giving effect to the Report, provided that the  other, parties accepted it.      They also contained an offer to give a further subsidy of  3,000,000 to the Industry, in addition to the  23,000,000 already voted by Parliament.Among the most emphatic conclusions of the Commission was their, conclusion that a disaster was impending over the industry which could only be averted by an Immediate reduction in labour costs of production.      It is clear fromhe Secretary,Afters&apos; Federation of Great Britain, p Russell Square, W.C1.
the resolution of your conference that your Federation, though they largely agree with the Government&apos;s legislative and administrative proposals,  still refuse to consider any alteration of wages or. hours.     So long as this is their attitude, and in the absence of any practical proposals from the Federation designed to meet the circumstances of the industry, the Prime Minister does not see that any useful purpose would be served by his meeting you, but he will hold, himself available to arrange a further disc\;ssion the moment that he is informed that you find yourselves In a position to submit suggestions of the kind required.The Government have never concealed the fact that there are recommendations in the Report that they only accepted with reluctance, and could not have accepted except In the hope of a general settlement.     This hope has been disappointed.      In these circumstances, it must be clearly understood that the Government regain their freedom for all purposes, and no longer hold themselves bound by the terms of an offer which has been rejected. In particular,  in view of the great and growing burden imposed on the national finances by the General Strike, and the present stoppage in the Coal Mining Industry,  it will be Impossible for the Government to hold open beyond the end of the present month the offer of any further subsidy.I have only to add, with reference to the last paragraph of your letter,  that you are mistaken in supposing that there is any discrepancy between that sentence In thePrime Minister&apos;s broadcasted speech,  to which you refer,  andthe proposals put  forward by him on behalf of the Government.No such discrepancy exists,  and in the opinion of the PrimeMinister the terms proposed,  If accepted on both sides with good spirit,  would by their results have fully justifiedt?nose sentences of his speech to which from call attention.I am, Sir,Yours fai thfullv, (S d. ) ROM LD W ATERHOUSE.
