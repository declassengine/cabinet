This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government..0 B S T,CABINET..*&quot;2    : A265(26)TRANSFER OF CHURCHYARDS IN WALES.Memorandum by the Home Secretary.I wish to call the attention of my colleagues to the difficulty which has arisen in carrying out t-he provisions of the Welsh Church Act as to the disposal of Churchyards in Wales.The provisions of Section R of the Act of 1914 are briefly as follows:-The Welsh Church Commissioners are required to hand over to the Representative Body of the Church in Wales(a) (if requested by that Body) burial grounds belongingto the Church which before the date of disestablishment&quot;were formally closed by Act of Parliament or Order in Council.(b) Burial grounds or parts of burial grounds belonging to the Church which were &quot;private benefactions&apos;&apos;  i.e. voluntarily given by any person or persons since the year 1662  (see definition of &quot;private benefactions&quot;  in section 7).All other burial grounds or parts of burial grounds must be handed over to the burial authority of the district in which they are situated  (which in most cases would be the parish council or district council). By the Welsh Church (Temporalities) Act 1919 the date of disestablishment was postponed to 31st March 1920j    and section 4 of the same Act provided that the Welsh Church Commissioners might postpone the transfer of any property (which of course Includes burial grounds) to any person other than the representative Body,  and that such persons should not be bound to accept the transfer of any such property until the Secretary of State so directs..    Undoubtedly the sections of the 1914- Act were drafted and passed in the belief that the effect
-2-tof them would be to hand over the great majority of the church-yards to the looal authorities.    But as soon as the Welsh Church Commissioners began to carry them into effeot serious difficulties became apparent.    A large number of the local authorities concerned exercised their power of refusing to accept transfer under section 4 of the Act of 1919:    and it has been found that in the case of tho majority of churchyards, additions to the old portions have been made in recent years by private benefactions so that the part now used is modern, and the old part is to all intents and purposes closed, although it may not have been formally closed by Order.    The effect of this is that in a very large number of cases the Local Authority is not entitled to receive the part which is now used (see under (b) above), but only that which is practically out of use, this part representing simply a liability to keep in order and repair.    Every effort has been used to induce the looal authorities to accept transfer of the burial grounds.    As soon as it became apparent to the Welsh Church Commission that the local authorities would be likely to refuse to take over the burial grounds,  they prepared a circular to local authorities informing them of the legal position and asking if they would be prepared to accept transfer;.    and after an informal discussion with representatives of the Welsh Parliamentary Party this circular was issued in May 1924. Before its issue however it was submitted also to six representatives of the Council of Evangelical Churches of Wales (representing all the principal Nonconformist denominations) who agreed that it was &quot;a fair and unbiassed statement of the position as defined by the Welsh Churoh Act&quot; .    When the replies came in they showed an immense preponderance of refusals,  and some local authorities, which had agreed to accept transfer, have since expressed a wish to withdraw their acceptance.    As it seemed possible that some of the smaller local authorities had not. clearly understood the somewhat technical language of the Commissioner^ circular after conferring with and at the request of the Welsh Parliamentary Party,  I prepared a second circular,
explaining as simply as possible the situations which had -arisen, and issued it in English and Welsh,    A copy of this circular is attached.The results were however,  disappointing.    Up to the present time 546 local authorities have refused to take over the burial grounds,  123 have agreed to do so,  and about 200 have not replied at all.    No doubt most of these 200 intend to refuse.    The Welsh Commissioners have already issued Orders of Transfer in the case of 98 out of the 128 acceptances and they are proceeding with the utmost despatch to transfer the remainder.The provisions of the Act in question have therefore definitely broken down in practice.    The Commissioners have no power to transfer the burial grounds to anyone but the local authorities:    they cannot retain them themselves, as they are not a burial authority, and have no funds which they can properly apply to the upkeep of the grounds.    Meanwhile the burial grounds are rapidly falling into a state of neglect and dilapidation which will before long create a public scandal. It is true that I have power under section 4 of the 1919 Act to direct the recalcitrant authorities to accept the transfer? but to try to coerce some 600 to 700 Welsh Local Authorities to undertake the duty of maintaining ancient burial grounds which are of no real use to them is impossible in practice and would be very inexpedient even if it were practicable.The only course open appears to me to be legislation to amend the provisions of the Acts above mentioned.    The Commissioners inform me that the Representative Body of the Welsh Church would, be prepared to accept and arrange for the maintenance of these burial grounds if they had power to d.o so, which they have not at present.    I suggest therefore the introduction of a Bill empowering the Welsh Church Commissioners to hand over to the Representative Body such burial grounds as the local authorities decline to accept.    Such a Bill would be short and should not raise any controversy or present any difficulty.8th  mi W.J.H.ath July,   19gg,
HOME OFFICE,WHITEHALL. July, 1925.Sir,I am told by the Commissioners of Church Temporalities in Wales that, under the provisions of the Welsh Church Act, 1914, the burial ground or a portion of the burial ground surrounding the parish church ofis transferable to your Council, but that your Council declines to accept the transfer.    The Commissioners have no power to hand over this burial ground to any person or body of persons other than your Council, and at the same time they are not in a position to hold and manage it themselves.    They have, therefore, reported the matter to me, as Secretary of State, because Section 4 (l) of the Welsh Church (Temporalities) Act, 1919, empowers me to direct any local authority which has refused transfer, to take over their burial ground.   I should be sorry, however, to exercise this power of compulsion if it can be avoided;    and as it seems possible that your Council may not have clearly understood the position from the circular letter sent to you by the Welsh Church Commission in 1924, I desire to take this opportunity of explaining the matter to you further.The Act of 1914 required the local authorities concerned to take over and manage the burial grounds, and as the law stands no other body or person has power to hold and manage, or funds which can properly be applied to keep up, these grounds.    Unless therefore your Council takes over and administers the burial ground above mentioned it will certainly fall into a state of neglect and decay;    and it will sooner or later become necessary either for the Secretary of State to exercise his power of directing the Council to take over the ground, or for legislation to be passed to make some other arrangement for the maintenance of the burial grounds.I do not wish to have to adopt either of these alternatives, if I can avoid it, and for this reason I am asking your Council to reconsider their former decision and I hope that they will consent to accept the obligation placed upon them by the Welsh Church Act.1 shall be glad if you will let me have your Council&apos;s reply as scon as possible.I am,Sir,Your obedient Servant,(Signed) W. J0TNS0N-HICKS.The Clerk
