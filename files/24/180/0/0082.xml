Government House, OTTAWA. 7th July,  1926.Sir,With reference to my Secret Telegram of the 30th June and to the correspondence between Mr. King and myself which was telegraphed later, I have the honour to enclose a copy of a further letter from Mr. King and of my reply thereto. These are being added to the official record.I have, etc.(Sd.) BYNG OP VIMY.U.Col.The Rt.Hon.L.S. Amery,M.P.,Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.
HOUSE OF COMMONS Leader of the Opposition.Ottawa,  July 3rd, 1926.&apos;His Excellency, GeneralThe Right Hon.  The Lord Byng of VImy,G.C.B. ,G.CM.G,. ,etcGovernor General of the Dominion of Canada OTTAWA.My dear Lord Byng,,I duly received Your Excellency&apos;s letter of June 29th, for which I desire to thank Your Excellency.Paragraph three of Your Excellency&apos;s letter reads as follows :&quot;You advise me &quot;that as,  in your opinion, Mr. Melghen is unable to govern the country, there should be another Election with the present machinery to enable the people to decide.&quot;Also,&quot;My contention Is that MrB Meighen has not been given a chance of trying to govern,  or saying that he cannot do so,  and that all reasonable expedients should bo tried before resorting to another Election.&quot;To the accuracy of the statement of Your Excellency&apos;s contention as set forth in this paragraph, I have no exception to take.      Inasmuch, however,  as what purports to have been my advice to Your Excellency appears in Your Excellency&apos;s letter within quotation marks, and might therefore be assumed to be words of mine as expressed In conversation with Your Excellency in tendering advice, may I respectfully say that the  words &quot;with the present machinery&quot; - apart from the context in which they are to be found being set forth as a quotation - are quite misleading, as no such words were used or referred to by me in any advice tendered.      Fortunately, the text of the quotation clearly indicates that the words taken as a whole could not have come from me as quoted.I advised Your Excellency that, - in my opinion,, the existing situation in the House of Commons demanded a dissolution of parliament, and that there should be another- 1-        /
election, to enable the people to decide upon a new House of Commons.In reply to Your Excellency&apos;s contention that Mr. Meighen had not been given a chance of trying to govern,  or saying that he could not do so,  I said that I could not advise Your Excellency to send for Mr, Meighen to form an administration,  as I did not believe Mr. Meighen could form an administration which would command the confidence of the Hou.se.     As to Mr. Meighen not having been given a chance of trying to govern, I pointed out that at the commencement of the Session It had been left to the people1s representatives in parliament to decide as to who was to advise Your Excellency, and that Mr. Meighen&apos;s chances to obtain the support of the Commons had been quite as g&apos;od as my own;   that the House of Commons having declined to express any confidence in Mr. Meighen throughout the entire session,  I could not see wherein there was any probability of the House giving him the support which would enable him to carry on the government and. that therefore I could not assume the responsibility of advising Your Excellency to send for him..    As there was still less probability of any other Hon. Member of the House being able to command its confidence, dissolution, to be followed by a general election,  in which the people would be given an opportunity to decide,, appeared to me the only course which I could advise, and I advised accordingly.As no formal record of the conversations between us was kept, I have felt,  in view of the representation of -paragraph three of Your Excellenc^r1 s letter, which will become a matter of official record, I should also record on paper my own statement of the advice tendered Your Excellency, both as Regards dissolution and Your Excellency&apos;s contention In reference thereto.
With respect to the concluding paragraph of Your Excellency&apos;s letter, may I say that I arn sure that the regret felt by Your Excellency at the severance of our official companionship was not any greater than my own, and that I acknowledge with not less gratitude the help of Your Excellency&apos;s counsel and co-operation throughout the period during which I had the privilege of enjoying Your Excellency&apos;s confidence,,I am,  etc,,(Sd. ) W. L e Mackenzle King.
July 5th,   1926.Dear Mr. King,Many thanks for your letter of July 3rd. The letter in question was. written entirely from the wish on my part to express my sincere gratitude for the help and co-operation you have given me during your tenure of the Premiership..      The quotations in it are by no means intended to recall words used at our meetings,  and in that connection I would ask jovl to read the preceding paragraph.I was stating my impression as to the one point at Issue, and endeavouring to pj.t It in a condensed form,Of course I readily add your letter to the documentary record of the situation.Yours sincerely,(Sd.)  BYTTY OF VIMY.
