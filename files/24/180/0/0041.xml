7 gel IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT) .CONFIDENTIAL. O.P.  41(26).---- c a e t jj e ttRUSSIA!?    MONEYcCopy of letter from the Trades Union Congress General Oounol 1 to the Prime Minister.(Ciroulated by direction of the Prime Minister).32, Bccleston Square,London,    S.&apos;W:.l. 12th June, 19 26.The RtoHono S. Baldwin, M.P. , Prime Minister,10, Downing Street. 3    . 1.Dear Sir,Relations with the U*S.S.R. I am directed to write you in connection with the serious position which appears to bo developing in the relationship between His Majesty:s Government and tho Union of Socialist Soviet Republics.    It is announced that a note has been sent to the Government of the UoSoS.Ro  and while the precise contents of the note are not publicly known,  it is stated that very grave exception is taken to the alleged action of the Soviet Government in sending to the General Council of the Trades Union Congress funds to assist the Council in prosecution of the General Strike.I have to state quite explicitly that no monies of any kind have been received by the General Council,  either during the General Strike or at any other time from the Government of the U.S.S.R.      During tho General Strike the General Council publicly announced the receipt of advices from the All-Russian Council of Trade Unions stating that money was being sent to assist the British Workers in the General Strike.COPY NO.
It was at tho same time stateu that the General Council, whilst .fully appreciating that the only desire of the Russian Trade Unions was to assist financially British Trade Unionists in their struggle to secure economic justice for the Miners,  felt that the  offer would he wilfully misrepresented and acceptance would he misunderstood. The  General Council accordingly gave instruct ions that the money was to be returned.      Those instructions were duly carried out.The- General Council is not aware of there being the slightest vestige of evidence to support the allegation that this money was sent either directly or indirectly from the resources of the Government of the Uo 8..S .R.      In view of tho statement made in tho House of Commons by the Home Secretary on the 10th instant that ho had not been able to establish that the money had been directly or definitely sent by the Soviet Government,  it is particularly regrettable that the action of His Majesty&apos;s Government should have given credence to unwarranted allegations that money has boon so received.I am directed to protest most strongly against the attempts that are being made to misrepresent the efforts of the Russian Trade-Unionists to help the British workers in the pursuit of legitimate Trade Union activities.,  and tc use thorn in such a way as seriously to endanger the relationship between Eis Majesty1s Government and the Union of Socialist Soviet Republics.Yours faithfully,(Signed)    WALTER M. CITRINE.Acting Secretary.
