1 moCopy of letter from the President of the Executive Council, Irish Free State,  to the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.DublinSth June, 1926.The Rt.Hon.L.S. Amery,M.P.Secretary of State for the Dominions, Downing Street,London.Dear Mr. Amery,I have discussed with my colleagues your letter of the 27th ultimo on the subject of the Lone Pictures  -nd I am bound to say that we are disappointed it the deoision arrived at by the Cabinet that it would be improper to modify Sir Hugh Lane&apos;s Willjby legislation.     We had hoped that the consideration of Sir Hugh laners undoubted intent on, as expressed in the Codicil of the 3rd February, 1915, to bequeath these &quot;pictures to the City of Dublin would be regarded as of sufficient weight to justify the introduction of legislation to give effect to that intention.Whatever may be the leg; 1 position, the Irish art-loving public have always regarded these pictures as belonging of right to their country, and there oan be no doubt of the deep interest which they take in the question of the return of the collection to Ireland.      The;v cannot fail to feel dissatisfaction   at the insistence upon a legal technicality in order to retain possession to the National Gallery in London of a collection, the v?lue of which to Dublin would, by reason of the limited opportunity which exists here for the acquisition of works of art, be incomparably greater than the relative loss to London, which possesses in its many Art Galleries numerous examples of the works of Modern Masters.My colleagues and I would not feel justified in agreeing that the loan for a substantial period to the Dublin
Gallery of a portion of the Lane Collection could be accepted as a final settlement of the matter.     We feel that justice and equity    like dictate that the pictures should be disposed of in accordance with the donor&apos;s lrst expressed desire.     We feel too that in a matter of this kind there should be no appearance of haggling as between two sister nations of the Commonwealth, and we venture therefore to express an earnest hope that the Cabinet may see their way to authorise the introduction of the necessary legislation to enable the collection to be permanently transferred to this country.Yours sincerely,(Sd) WoT. Gosgr;.ve.II.Copy of letter from the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs to the President of the Executive Council,    Irish Pree State.Downing Street,S.W.1.12th June, 1926,Dei r Mr.  Cosgrave,I have brought your letter of the 8th instant regarding the Lane Pictures before the Cabinet, and it has been carefully considered.We ere very sorry that you end your colleagues are disappointed at the decision reached but we do not feel   that the considerations which you mention would justify us in varying that decision, which was only reached after prolonged enquiry and full discussion.
In the circumstances   we think that the only course open to us is to publish the Report of the Wilson Committee very shortly,  and thereafter to state in Parliament our decision on that Report.I enclose for your information and that of your colleagues the draft    of a Parliamentary question and answer which indicate the form in which we propose to announce the decision.I would only add that we should be sorry if theidea gained ground that our decision was due, as you suggest, to insistence upon a legal technicality.    I think, However,that publication of the considerations involved, which are set out in seme detail in the Report of the Wilson Committee,should make it clear that this is not the case.Yours sincerely,(Sd)    LoS. Anery.ENCLOSURE    TO    II . DRAFT OP QUESTION.To ask the Prime Minister what l.ction His Majesty^ Government propose to take on the Report of the Committee appointed by the late Government to consider certain questions relating to the 39 pictures bequeathed under the Will of the late Sir Hugh Lane to the National Gallery in London,DRAFT OF reply His Majesty&apos;s Government have given very careful consideration over e prolonged period to the whole matter dealt with in this Report and they have decided that they must accept the conclusion reached by the Committee, that it would
be improper to modify Sir Hugh Lane1 s Will by legislation,,They have, however, received an assurance from the Trustees of the National Gallery that it is their present intention to lend to Dublin a substantial number of the pictures in question from time to time end for a substantial period, as soon as they are empowered to do so under Section 4 of the National Gallery (Loan) Act,  1803, that is to say at the expiration of 15 years from the date when the pictures came under their possession, whether a special Gallery has then been provided in Dublin or notDCopy of letter from the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs to the Governor General of the Irish Pree State.Personal Downing Street,S .W. 1.12th June,1926.I am grateful for your letter of the 5th instant regarding the Lane Pictures.      I now enclose for your information a copy of a letter on the subject which I hive received from Mr.  Cosgrave.I have brought this letter before my colleagues,  and I enclose a copy of the reply which, at their request,  I am sending to it.I would only add that Mr.  Cosgrave is altogether mistaken if he thinks that we hi-ve considered this question otherwise than purely on its merits.      Had any other Dominion in similar circumstances suggested thtt the legal effect of the Will should be varied by legislation,  exactly the same considerations would have arisen as were before us in the present case, and I am confident that our decision would have been the same.Yours sincerely,fSd)    L.S. Amery.
