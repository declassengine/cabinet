DOCUMENT JEJCH^property  OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT) .CABINET. THE ROYAL ASSENT. Memorandum by the Lord Chancellor.I wish to call the attention of my colleagues to the inconvenience caused to both Houses of Parliament by the practice followed at present by many Departments as regards the preliminary steps taken before the Royal Assent Is obtained.The ceremony of pronouncing the Royal Assent frequently involves a prolongation of the sittings of the House of Lords, and always involves an inconvenient break in the proceedings of the House of Commons. When the ceremony has to be performed at short notice, the Inconvenience is Increased,  as it is most difficult to fix a time within the period which is reasonably convenient to either House.Furthermore, the formal steps which have to be taken In the preparation of the Commission for giving the Assent and obtaining His Majesty&apos;s approval to it take time, and additional Inconvenience is caused when they have to be hurried.      It is,  therefore, most desirable that the ceremony of giving the Roval Assent should be in-frequent, and that a reasonable length of notice should he given when it is required.C RET.COPY261(26) ,
During the .;ar,  it was often necessary to pass legislation to meet particular emergencies almost at a moment1s notice, and, for this purpose, Assents &quot;became frequent. But since the War, many Departments of State have retained the iVar time habit of pressing for Royal Assents at short notice, and often when no urgency exists.At the close of last week,  I was suddenly informed that it was imperatively necessary that the Unemployment Insurance Bill should receive the Royal Assent not later than the 30th June.    Accordingly, at very short notice,  the iioyal Assent was arranged for that day.    I am now advised by the Parliamentary Counsel that it would have been sufficient if the Royal Assent had been given to the Bill on Wednesday of next week,  or even on Thursday. Thus the time of both Houses has been occupied unnecessarily since,  in any event, a Royal Assent will be required next week for the Coal Mines 3j.il, end this fact might have been ascertained by reasonable diligence on the part of the Department concerned,  or,  if due notice had been given, by myself.
It is not possible for the Whips, tho officials of tha House or the officials of my Department by examining tho Bills to ascertain from their contents whether it is impexativo that they should receive the Royal assent by a particular date. It is for tho Departmant by whom a Bill is promoted itsolf formally to ascertain this fact and bring it to tho attention of those responsible.The proper course is that the Department concerned should, some considerable time before the date on which it is desired that a Bill should become law, communicate with the Chief Government Whip in the House of Lords, who could then, after consulting the Leader of the House, make suitable arrangements in consultation with the Chief -/hip in the House of Commons.      Whan the conmiunication is mode to the Chief Whip,  a simultaneous communication should be made to me through by Permanent Secretary, as, by the practice of Parliament, the presence of the -Lord Chancellor is required at the pronouncement of the Royal Assent, and if the time is fixed without reference to me, great dislocation of public business may ensuo.I should bo greatly obliged if my colleagues would instruct their Departmental Officers to follow this practice.0      V B.HOUSE OP LORDS.2nd July,  19 26 .
