RECONSIDERATION OP SUBSIDY0 Memorandum by the Minister of Health.1. Under section 5 of the Housing (Financial Provisions)Act, 1924, the Minister of Health and the Scottish Board ofHealth are required after the 1st October cf the present yeartoao consider the question of the revision of the various subsidies for housing purposes other than the subsidies in connection with slum clearance *The Exchequer subsidies falling to be reviewed are -(I) Under the Housing (Financial Provisions) Act, 1924(which applies to houses which are subject to oertainrent conditions) -(a) In Agricultural parishes    12.10 per annum perhouse for 40 years *(b) In other places  9 per annum per house for 40 years *(11) Under the Housing eto. Act, 1923 (houses not subject to any rent condition) -  6 per house per annum for 20 years *If as a resxilt of this review an alteration in the rate of Exchequer subsidy is made, a consequential alteration has to be made in the obligatory contribution which local authorities are required to make under the 1924 Act where the rents charged for houses provided under that Act exceed a certain level.     This obligatory contribution is at the rate of  4.10. per house per annum for 40 years. 2&quot; The section requires that in connection with the review of the subsidy the Minister and the Scottish Board of Health are to take into consideration expenses likely to be Incurred in the 2 years from 1st October,, 1926.! regard being had
(i) To the expenses Incurred in the previous 2 years (ii) To the expenses likely to be incurred in the following 2 years.Following this consideration and consultation with local authorities the Minister and the Secretary of State may make an Order varying the subsidy:    the subsidy may not, however, be increased except with, the authority of Parliament.If the subsidy is varied, the Order providing for the variation may specify a date, and houses completed by that date are to be eligible for grant on the basis in force before the variation of the subsidy.It is to be noted that the Act makes special provision for the control of Parliament over any order which nay be made.     Under section 6 of the Act of 1924 it is provided that a draft of any proposed Order must be laid before Parliament and the Order may not be finally made unless and until a resolution is passed by the House of Commons approving the draft.It has been strongly represented to me by the various Associations of Local Authorities, by individual local authorities and by organisations representative of builders that the deferment of the review of the subsidy until after 1st October next produces a state of uncertainty which prevents local authorities and builders from proceeding uninterruptedly with their building programmes, and involves serious risk of a drop in the rate of production of working class houses.     They have urged especially that whatever may be done hereafter about the subsidy, a definite announcement should be made as soon as possible of the date up to which the existing subsidy will be available.     I recognise the danger of a break in the continuity of house production which I am most anxious to avoid and I have, therefore had a number of consultations with local authorities&apos;
representatives In order to see whether 8ny arrangement could be agreed at the present stage. 4. The broad facts of the housing situation may besummarised as follows:-a* fP?1?.?-0^ During the last three financial years the total number of houses completed In England and Wales rcere -1923 - 24 - 86,0001924 - 25 - 137,0001925 - 26 - 173,000 .The number built in 1925 - 26 far exceeds the largest number ever built in one year either before or since the War and It Is quite clear that substantial pro-gress is being made In making good the arrears.     It Is, however, too early to state that the end of the shortage Is yet in sight,     Birmingham reports that they have approximately satisfied the demand of those who can pay the rent to be expected from the good class artizan, but that they have still to make very considerable provision to meet the needs of the very poor.     The industrial districts generally maintain however that the pressure on them to provide further houses, as evidenced by waiting lists of applicants, reports of overcrowding etc. is still Intense.Of the 173,000 houses built in 1925/26 local authorities built 44,000 while 129,000 were erected by private builders-     Of the latter 66,000 were built without the aid of sx*bsidy.       It will be seen that   private enterprise in house building has
been put on its feet again.     One important result is a considerable increase in the number of men in the various crafts concerned in house building.     The boom in house building has also operated to stimulate the production of materials and, apart from the special effects of the present coal strike, it may be taken that this former source of serious difficulty hag been overcome.b.  The cost of cottage building as evidenced by tenders accepted by local authorities during the past year has been fairly steady.    It is, however, at a higher level than that which obtained when &apos; the subsidy under the 192 4 Act was fixed and still higher than the cost on which the 1923 subsidy was based.The average prices of non-parlour houses in December 1922, 1924 and 1925 were  340,  414 and  448 respectively.     It seems probable that the subsidies granted have to some extent gone to increase the price of building.If pre-war conditions are taken as standard and represented by 100 -The present index of wholesale price is - 145 The cost of living figure is -   170The cost of house building is -   200c. Financial Burden of Housing Subsidiss on Exchequer.The Ministry of Health estimates for the year 1926/27 include  8,487,000 for housing subsidies. This includes  7,170,000 for the Add is on, Scheme which may be
ftj 9 S3expected to be fairly constant for a long time to come. If it is assumed that the present rate of building is maintained housing subsidies will increase at the rate of approximately  900,000 a year.     Housing grants are, therefore, estimated for the next 4 years as follows1926 - 27 - 8,487,0001927 - 28 - 9,340,0001928 - 29 - 10,240,0001929 - 30 - 11,140,0005, The bearing of these considerations has been fully discussed with representatives of the London County Council and the Associations of Municipal Corporations, Urban District Councils and Rural District Councils.   These bodies have held independent conferences on the subject.All these authorities are unanimous that no case has yet been made out for the reduction of subsidy.   They point out that the expenses incurred in the provision of houses during the last two years have not been less, but if anything more than was expected.     They do not admit that the eKpenses to be incurred in the next two years are likely to be any less.     They profess to attach no importance to the increased availability of labour and materials or the possibility of diminishing, demand tending to reduce prices-5-
and therefore rendering lower subsidies practicable. They are inclined to regard the proposition that subsidies tend to keep up the price as academic At best they regard the recognition of these factors as a gamble which might result in burdens being transferred from the Exchequer to the local authorities.Their general demand was for an assurance that the existing rates of subsidy should be continued till 1st October, 1928, and they suggested that if this demand were met further discussions might be initiated in October, 1927 as to the basis of subsidy after October,1928.The possibility was also discussed of limiting by administrative measures the ecope of the subsidies, and the local authorities were asked to consider the desirability of concentrating in their own building programmes on the erection of the smaller types of house and,in dealing with applications from private builders, to limit the grant of subsidies to houses of lower value than has hitherto been the practice *   As to the first suggestion there is clearly a stronger case for the provision by the local authority of houses within the means of the poorest inhabitants than any other type of houses. It is to be anticipated that private enterprise will do little in this direction for a long time to come.     The representatives of the house builders have in fact strongly urged that local authorities should be strictly limited to this type of house and they contend that In building the larger house the local authorities are engaging in unfair competition with them.The second suggestion really tends in the same direction.    It is suggested with some measure of truth that
a considerable number of houses which have been erected by private enterprise with the aid of the subsidy would have been erected whether any subsidy were available or not:    and there appears to be a reasonable case for a gradual reduction of the field of assistance for private enterprise.The response of the local authorities was not very encouraging to either of these proposals.     On the first they said that this was a matter for the individual judgment of particular local authorities and that although some authorities might be favourable to a programme of small houses, the Associations wore generally against any reduction in size of houses and they pointed out that small houses were a worse financial proposition for local authorities than larger houses. As regards the second suggestion the Associations did not express any general view.   The opinions of individual local authorities were divided, but on the whole it may be said that this proposal provoked leas opposition than other suggestions.It will be seen that the local authorities were extremely unaccommodating and it is to be anticipated that if any steps in the direction of reducing subsidies are proposed strong efforts will be made to organise Parliamentary oppositionNevertheless I have come to the conclusion that the right policy is to work towards a gradual abandonment of the subsidies for building and that some positive action in this direction should be taken in the near future.    It is unnecessary to emphasise the seriousness of the growing burden of these subsidies and their crippling effect on other developments of our health service.     I am convinced that the price of houses is too high, that curtailment of subsidy should tend to reduce prices and that the present position of greatly improved labour and material conditions is a favourable one for
beginning the prooess of getting rid of subsidy.     At the same time I am clearly of opinion that the process mist be gradual end that If too big a step is   taken m run the risk of being rightly charged with having stopped house bnildincI have considered whether it might be possible to announce that houses completed by the 1st October, 1927, shall be eligible for present subsidies and that discussions of what should happen after that date shall be deferred until the early part of next year.     I am advised however that under the Housing Act, 1924, the decision as to the rate of subsidy for the second period contemplated by the Act must be taken this year and that otherwise a revision under the Act is not possible until October, 1928.     If it were proposed therefore to make a reduction next year further legislation would be necessary and this I think it is desirable to avoid.1 propose therefore, with the concurrence of the Secretary of State for Scotland, to make an order after the 1st October next, reducing the subsidy on houses completed after the 1st October, 1927, by a small amount, assuming that the Act of 1924 gives ua power to do this, as to which I am consulting the Attorney General, . 7* The sanction of the Cabinet is sought for thefollowing course(a) The Government to announce before the rising of Parliament that it is its intention to get rid of subsidies altogether, but that it is proposed that this should be done gradually and with as long notice as possible, so that the industry may have time to aocommodate itself to the position and discontinuity in house building may be avoided.(b) At the same time to announce that houses completed 1st October, 1927, will be eligible for the present rate of subsidy, but that for the second period contemplated by the Act- 3 *.
of 1924 subsidies will be slightly reduced.(o)   Subject to the opinion of the Attorney General an Order to be issued as soon as possible after the 1st October of this year reducing the subsidies under the Act of 1924 by  1, i.e. from  12.10.0. to  11,10.0, in agricultural parishes and from  9 to  8 elsewhere for 40 years, and under the Act of 1923 by  2,  i.e. from  6 to  4 for 20 years.   This Order would also stabilise the present subsidy for houses finished by 1st October, 1927,(d) Administrative pressure to be exercised on local authorities to secure their concentration on the smaller type * Of house   and free use to be made of the discretion of the Minister to permit the building of houses of less than the ordinary minimum size laid down by the Act of 1923,(e) Local authorities to be required gradually to restrict their grant of subsidies to private builders by adopting a lower standard of value as a critcricn of eligibility for subsidy.     A first step in this direction should be taken in the near future.The proposals above have been framed primarily in the light of experience in England and Wales.    I am aware that the position in Scotland looked at from the point of view &quot;of extent of building, cost of building and unsatisfied need is not so favourable, and if the Secretary of State considers that some differentiation is necessary I should not wish to oppose it.N.C.27th JulvT 1926.H    9     M
