(This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government).0 A B I N E TOPAL. .355 ( 86) .Memorandum by the Home Secretary.We have arrived at a position in the ooal stoppage when I desire to submit to my colleagues that the remainder of the country is entitled to some consideration.The mine owners&apos; and miners are fighting, I will assume for the purpose of this memorandum,  justifiably so, but the result is most detrimental to the rest of the community.The President of the Board of Trade at our last Cabinet gave us a very bleak outlook on the position in the manufac-turing world at the expiration of about ten days.      In addition to this the whole community is being inconvenienced to say the. least, by the lessening of railwajr facilities and tne use of electric light has been, by order, largely diminished in regard to theatres and so-forth.&quot;To come,  perhaps, from the sublime to the ridiculous,  I may mention that I have  just received a question asking whether I will forbid music and dancing in Clubs and compel them all to close earlier to save light.I submit that the Government should take every means to prevent these inconveniences and hardships upon the community and of course.still more so upon trade.I understand that the normal consumption of ooal in this country for all purposes is about four million tons per week. Ten days ago the Government ordered two-hundred-thousand tons from America . and it is known that some of the larger railway companies and other consumers are ordering considerable amounts.I believe, however,  it would be a very popular move amongst those members of the community who are not concerned in
June,  1926-2-the fight if the Government were    to import say five-hundred-thousand tons per week.      This is only one-eighth of the normal consumption but it would ease matters and especially it might  just be the means of keeping many manufacturing concerns going and prevent thousands more men being thrown upon unemployment benefit.It may be  said that it would cost a certain amount of monejr.      That is true, but so would half-a-million extra men on the dole.      Further it seems to me clear that the miners are very definitely relying upon the exhaustion of the community to achieve their end.      Equally 1 think the mine owners are to some extent relying upon the exhaustion of the individual miner and his wife to achieve their end and the fact that the Government had taken the matter in hand and did not intend the community to be throttled by laok of coal would go a long way to bringing the strike to an end by convincing the combatants that there was a third party to take a hand in the matter.I have never interfered in the negotiations, nor indeed have I given, as a Member of the Cabinet, any particular views upon it but I do think the time has come for someone to consider the rights and claims of the non-combatants.W.J.H.
