In the main they relate to persons -who had claims to benefit current and were not at work on the dates given. . .(2.) The figures above for the four weeks in June are exclusive of persons m the Coal-mining Industry who ceased work on account of the dispute which commenced on the 1st May.(3.) The latest figures available, viz., for the weeks ended the 19th and 26th July, 1926, are given.in Part (D) of this Report.The percentage of unemployment (Great Britain) in the insured industries at the end of June 1924       .... .... .... 9&quot;21925       .... .... .... -.   H*61926       .... .... .... .... 14&quot;5 (men only 151)The figures given in Table (A) above cover the four weeks ended the 28th June, 1926. During this period the numbers on the registers rose to the extent of 25,564; the increase since the 26th April, 1926, the latest date for which pre-dispute statistics are available, amounted to 657,899. Amongst men, unemployment increased progressively during the first three weeks, but improved considerably during the last week of the month, whilst unemployment amongst women, after fluctuating considerably, showed a marked increase towards the end of the month.[14874]
(B.) Analysis of the Number of Persons on the Registers of Employment Exchanges in Great Britain at the 28th June, 1926.	Wholly Unemployed.	Temporary Stoppages.	Casuals.	Total.Men Boys Women Girls	714,547 24,195 104,417 24,857	429,719 18,665 221,978 20,979	79,349 172 882 16	1,223,615 43,032 327,277 45,852Total..	868,016	691,341	80,419	1,639,776A comparison of the above table with the corresponding figures for the end of May shows that, while there has actually been a slight decrease in the wholly unemployed figure, this was much more than counter-balanced by a considerable increase in the number of temporary stoppages.(C.) Unemployment in Insured Industries.The latest date for which unemployment figures by industries are available is the 21st June, 1926, at which date the percentage unemployed in Great Britain and Northern Ireland was 14&apos;7, as compared with 14&apos;5 at the 24th May, 1926, with 11*9 at the 22nd June, 1925, and with 9&apos;3 at the 23rd June, 1924. The figures at the 21st June in respect of industries showing appreciable variations in unemployment during the month, together with the increase or decrease as compared with the previous month, with the 26th April, 1926, and with a year ago are given in the table below : Industry.

While some considerable progress has been made towards a recovery from the disorganisation of industry caused by the general- strike, employment in the principal industries continued to be adversely affected by the uncertainty in the industrial situation. Unemployment in the Shipbuilding, Iron and Steel and other coal-consuming industries remained acute, although the position in certain districts showed a tendency to improve as alternative sources of fuel became available. In most of the textile industries it would appear that the unemploy-ment figures scarcely serve to afford sufficient indication of the extent to which production has been curtailed. In the American Cotton Spinning Section during the greater part of the month less than half-time on the average was worked as a result of a further application of the organised short-time policy. The increased amount of short-time working in the Egyptian Spinning Section was largely attributable to a shortage of fuel supplies. While this depression in the textile trades has only been accentuated by the recent industrial dislocation, reports from the various centimes tend to show that a satisfactory settlement in the coal-mining dispute would effect a very considerable improvement in the textile position. For the moment, however, increasing unemployment, as in the case of railway services, is all the more unsatisfactory in view of the fact that June is normally a month of increased seasonal activity.(D.) Latest Figures.The latest figures of unemployment published are those for the 19th July, giving the total number on the registers as 1,631,268. This is a decrease over the position on the 28th June amounting to 8,508, but an increase over a year ago of 409,356. The preliminary figure for the 26th July is 1,606,100, showing a decrease in one week of 25,168.ARTHUR STEEL-MAITLAND.Ministry of Labour,July 31, 1926.
