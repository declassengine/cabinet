itdocument is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.IR &apos;3 T. *3l(23) .CABINET.CRIMINAL JUSTICE  (AMENDMENT) BILL,   1926,Memorandum by the Home Secretary./m1 regret that 1 have to trouble my colleagues for approval to introduce immediately a short Bill to amend Section 7 of the Criminal Justice Act,   1925.    This Section (which comes into operation on the 1st July) will effect certain minor amendments of the Probation of Offenders Act,  1907,  but it has been found that owing to an unfortunate mistake the Section is defective in certain important respects.As my colleagues are aware,  Courts of Summary Jurisdiction are empowered under Section 1 of the Probation of Offenders Act, 1907,  when satisfied that a charge is proved,   either to dismiss the charge or to discharge the offender conditionally on his entering into a recognisance.    In either event it is in the Courts discretion to order the offender to pay costs and/or compensation. Section 7(8)  of the Criminal Justice Act,   1925, as it stands at present, would deprive the Courts of the power to order the payment of costs and/or compensation in cases where the charge is dismissed without the offender being required to enter into a recognisance.    This was not intended and it has been represented to me - and I agree - that the discontinuance of the power will cause serious embarrassment to the Courts in the administration of the criminal law,  and will present an obstacle to offenders being dealt with under the Probation of Offenders Act..    In 1924, 4700C cases were dismissed under the Act of 1907 without the offender entering into a recognisance and it may be presumed that the majority of such &quot;offenders were ordered to pay costs.The   subsection   is also defective in that it makes payment of costs or compensation a condition of the recognisance.    This would lead in practice to many difficulties:    and it is proposed
in the Bill to continue the present law whereby the order for costs or compensation is kept distinct from the recognisance.-The Bill also substitutes &quot;recognisance&quot;  for &quot;probation - order&quot;  in Section 7(4).    This is a mere drafting point but is necessary in order that the subsection may carry out its intention,  namely,  that a person who breaks any condition of a recognisance even though the recognisance does not include a condition as to supervision, shall have the benefit of the alternative provided by the subsection.    A similar amendment is made in Section 7(6).The opportunity has also been taken to extend the right of appeal under Section 7(1)  of the 1925 Act to all cases where a person  (who did not plead guilty or admit the truth of the information)  is found by the Court to be guilty,  and is dealt with under the Probation of Offenders Act.    This will be an improvement and a benefit to an innocent defendant.Finally the Bill provides that the certificate given by a Court under Section 7(5) may be admissible in evidence if it purports to be signed by a Justice.    Under the subsection as it now stands it will  be admissible in evidence,  but formal proof of the signature will be necessary,  and this requirement will seriously hinder the operation of the provision.I do not anticipate that the Bill will raise any controversy.    It  is mainly technical and should secure universal assent.    Ho question of principle can be regarded as involved, and it merely carries out the intention of Parliament last year.It  is most important that the Bill should receive the Royal Assent before the end of the month, in order that Section 7 of the  1925 Act should not come into operation in its present form on the 1st July next.If the proposal is agreed,  I propose to consult the Lord Chancellor as to the place in which the Bill should be introduced.A copy of a draft Bill is attached.   -June,   1926.
