RESTORATION OF THE DEFECTIVE STONEWORK AT THE&apos;    louses&apos; &quot;o^TKm^mw: !--Memorandum by the First CommissionerI append for the information of my colleagues a Memorandum on the defective condition of the stonework at the .   Houses of Parliament, and proposals for its restoration^ whioh ^is based on a much more detailed report by Sir Frank Baines, the Director of Works.The chief problem is to select a stone, the colour and texture of whioh will be in keeping with the existing magnesian. limestone, and which is able to resist the.-attacks of the sulphuric acid in the London atmosphere.      It is also essential that the atone should be readily obtainable in sufficient quantities of the required sise, and that it should be durable, but at the same time lend itself to the carving of the Gothic detail without undue coat.     A stone has been found which meet a all these requirements, but, before actually making a choice, 1 propose to seek the advice of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research.      I propose also to consult the Fine Art Commission as to the extent to whioh it is necessary to reproduce the elaborate detail in all parts of the building.The provisional estimate of the coat of the repairs is  1,062,350, but it is anticipated that a saving of approximately  60,000 can be effected by the omission of unnecessary details in the carving of the stone.

It is proposed in the first year to ask for a sum of not more than  40,000, the annual provision thereafter to be increased gradually as experience is gained in the work of repair.      The repairs will probably be spread over a period of from 12 to 15 years.P.

PORl^V/ORD. - -The object of the following memorandum is to describe the defective condition of the stonework of the House of Parliament and to suggest means by which It can be repaired.      It has also been thought desirable to add a brief account of the circumstances leading up to the present position in order that matters which would not appear to have had full consideration in the past may receive attention in any scheme of future repair.An endeavour has been made to keep the memorandum within reasonable limits, and at the same time to give sufficient inform-ation to enable a decision to be reached as to the. line of action to be taken.      Pull particulars are available of the tests referred to in the memorandum and of the evidence given before the various Select Committees, and also much fuller details regarding the qualities of the different Glasses of stone and the causes of decay.      It is thought, however, that sufficient evidence has been brought forward to show that the condition of the stonework is such as to justify a comprehensive scheme of repair and that a carefully selected sandstone is the best material to use to replace the stone which has to be removed.The memorandum is based on a much fuller report,prepared by Sir Prank Baines,. the Director of Works of His Majesty&apos;s Office of Works,  after exhaustive enquiries into the whole question, and although it is not considered necessary to publish the full report, Sir Prank Baines will be available to simplify any points arising in the memorandum,  particularly in regard to the material and methods to be adopted in the restoration.Lord Peel,  the Pirst Commissioner of Works, desires to place on record his high appreciation of the service rendered by Sir Prank 3aines in the preparation of the full report, which has been compiled with remarkable thoroughness and skill.      It has involved very considerable research,  extending over a number of years,  and much of the data will be of inestimable value to those who have finally to decide the nature and extent of the restoration.
1.  CONSTRUCTION OF BUILDING AND CHOICE OP AwSTUST STONE . &quot;n - The old Royal Palace of Westminster and itg parliament is Buildings were destroyed &quot;by the Great Fire of October, 1834,with the exception of a few sections of the buildings,  of which Westminster Hall was the most important i    In March 1835, a Select Committee of the House of Commons was appointed &quot;to consider and report upon such plan as may be most; fitting and convenient for the permanent accommodation of the Houses of parliament the Committee decided that the style of the new building should be either GCthic or Elizabethan, the design to be chosen by open competition.     The accepted design was that of i-Sr. (afterwards Sir) Charles Barry, who adopted the Gothic style of the Tudor period as being most in harmony with the old buildings which were to be preserved, namely, the Crypt of St. Stephen&apos;s dhapel  and the Cloisters and Chapels attached to the late Speaker&quot;s residence.    The Architect intended that &quot;the lower or ground stor-&apos;y and Terrace should be as simple  and solid as possible, in order to accord with the plainness of the Bridge and form a bold base to the building; and that the super-structure only should be of a decorative character,  so that the building might present a lofty,  imposing and ornate appearance when viewed from Westminster Bridge.&quot;     He also considered that &quot;the details of the River front should be large,  and those of the other fronts small, as the former could only be viewec from a distance, whereas the latter would be  subject to a much closer inspection.&quot;       These ijrinciples, however, were not closely followed, as practically the whole of the building is of a more or less uniformly decorative characterSir Charles Barry intended to retain St. Stephen&apos;s Chapel in the new building, but in view of the conflicting opinions expressed to the. Committee by various architects,  it was decided that the upper part of the building was too serioiisly injured by the great fire to allow of its retention,  and that It should be removed and only the Crypt preserved.    No part of the external  stone facings of St. Stephen&apos;s Chapel which are subject to failure to-day belongs to the original structure.   The Cloisters, however,  were retained in the new building and now form the Members Cloakroom,  and the Votes and Public Bill Offices.In deciding the styles in which designs for the New Buildings might be submitted, no consideration would appear to have been given by the Committee of 1835 to the question of their suitability to the atmospheric conditions of modern London; but during the  sittings of the Committee of 1836, appointed to examine and consider the approved plans -pointed questions were raised as to the  durability of structures erected in London in the Gothic style, particularly as regards the highly elaborated type selected by lor .Barry. Comparison was made with the architecture of Henry VII&apos;s Chapel,  and reference to the rapid decay of Its ornament is recorded.    Sir Robert Peel, who was a Member of this Committee, took a prominent part in the discussion, and gave what has since proved to have been wise counsel on the necessity for an expert enquiry into the causes of decay in the stone of other great buildings in the Metropolis.    He also advocated the selection of a stone for the erection of the new Palace of Westminster with a view to its ultimate durability and permanence .
The Committee, however,  adopted Mr. Barry&apos;s design in Kay, 1836,  subject only to certain  alterations in plan.of Two years later,  In 1838, four Commissioners were appointed by the Treasury to select the stone for the new building.    These Commissioners,   after inspecting various stone quarries, and visiting numerous public buildings reported in March 1839 in favour of the magnesian limestone from Bolsover Moor.,  chiefly on account of its uniformity of colour,  its crystalline structure, and its supposed durability.    Bolsover Moor stone was accordingly used at the commencement but it  was found impossible to obtain blocks of  sufficient size, and, the same difficulty having been experienced in connection with stone from a quarry at Mansfield V/oodhouse,  vhich was used for a time, the Commissioners finally chose a stone from Anston in Yorkshire,   although Us quarry defects were well known.The  stones of Bolsover door, Mansfield Woodhouse and Anston, all of which are usually referred to as 11 Anston&quot;, are magnesian limestones, a name applied to any stone which contains an appreciable amount of dolomite, i e . - a distinct mineral composed of 54.35$ calcium carbonate  and 45.65$ magnesium carbonate.      Magnesium limestone may also contain calcite, but its durability depends on the closeness with which it approaches to the composition of dolomite, and It -.vill be seen from the following approximate percentages of calcium carbonate and magnesium carbonate in the three stones vised at the Houses of Parliament, that all three are almost completely dolomitic in composition.Calcium MagnesiumCarbonate .       Carbonat e .Bolsover Moor, 52 40Mansfield Woodhouse 53 44Anston 55 42The first stone of the building was laid in 1840 and the greater part of the  work was finished in from 10 to 12 years, the House of Lords occupying their Chamber in 1847 and the House of Commons in 1852.   This comparatively rapid rate of building (St.Paul1s took 35 years to build) may partly explain the failure to give proper attention to the selection of the stone.
2.    FIRST EVIPSflCES OF DECAY *ItD ANALYSIS OP CAUSES.tioent Evidences of decay in the structure were discovered even before the building was completed; and in 1861, an expert Committee was appointed by the First Commissioner of Her Majesty&apos;s Works and Public Buildings to enquire into the matter, and to suggest the best means of preserving the stone from further decay.One of the chief witnesses before the Committee was the Chief Clerk of Works of the building, who stated that he first observed symptoms of decay in 1849.     The stone was said to become more yellow in tint, efflorescence occurred, and the stone threw off a White powder.     The Contractor1s Manager stated that the  Marrefioi d   Woo&amp;house stone showed no signs whatever of decay, whereas the Anston stone was &quot;very venty&quot;.     This was the first.-reference to what has since been discovered to be the chief fault, and it is difficult to understand why the Committee made no mention of this evidence in their Report.fof The Committee visited several buildings in the Metropoliswhich were built of Anston stone, and found that in most cases Itn        they were exhibiting material signs of decay, such decay being more pronounced in cases where the stone was not speoially Bgs.     selected. isions The Committee concluded: -(a) that the decay was chiefly due to atmospheric tee. impurities:(b) that the lower portions of the building were more subject to decay and that decay was due more to the position of the stone in the building than to the use Of particular beds of stone:(c) that the stone was more likely to decay In damp and sheltered situations than when fully exposed,:-(d) that decay could not be attributed to face bedding, i.e. placing the horizontal bed of the stone in a vertical position;(e) that the decay was probably more extensive than was apparent on the surface; and(f) that the decay did not affect the stability of the structure, and was more pronounced on the plain surface than in the elaborately wrought portions.of the building.later experience however has shown that face bedding and the variable quality of the stone, were largely responsible for the decay,  and also that the more exposed parts of the building are on the whole showing the greatest signs of decay.When the stone was taken from the quarry, no attempt^was made to mark it in order to ensure that it was pl^iced on its natural bed in the building,  and consequently stones such as mullions for windows,  etc., were face bedded.      The unfortunate results are shown clearly in photographs Wos.During the course of recent enquiries an exhaustive examination has been made into all the known causes of stone decay; which may be either subterranean or atmospheric.
^9 StSubterranean causes are such as affect the stone in the ry,    quarry and give rise to certain inherent natural defects which render the stone more liable to surface decay.      The chief of these are constant variations in the quality&apos; and physical structure of the stone,  irregular concretions, marly layers, clay pockets or seams of foreign matter, and fine, obscure veins that represent old sealed fractures and cleavage planes through the beds of the stone.      The last Is the characteristic inherent defect of Anston and other magnesian limestones, and is the chief cause of the extensive failure of the stonework at the Houses of Parliament.     These old, re-sealed cleavage planes and fractures were probably caused by earth movement as a result of shrinkage and folding of strata.      The cleavages and fractures, however, appear to have been so closely sealed up at a later age by intrusion of calcitic matter as to be hardly discernible during the quarrying and working of the stone. The removal of the enormous earth pressures that bound the beds of stone together, combined with prolonged exposure of the worked stone to conditions unknown in the quarry, causes these sealed cleavage planes to re-open, with the risk of masses of stone becoming detached and falling.     These open cracks and cleavages in the stonework of the building, are referred,to as &quot;vents&quot; or &quot;ventages&quot;,Thorough and extensive examination of the stone in the ct- quarry is therefore of primary importance.      It is almost equally aarry. important that the true bed of the stone should be ascertained in the quarry,  and marked on every block,  so th.-.\t it may be identified and placed horizontally on its natural bed in the building.1 Atmospheric causes of decay may be divided into mechanicalcal and chemical causes.      The mechanical agencies are wind, rain, dust,  sudden variations of temperature., frost, crystallising force, and alternating barometric pressure.      The chief of the chemical agents which attack stone are carbon dioxide and sulphuric acid,  the former partly and the latter wholly, resulting from the combustion of coal,  the annual consumption of which ih London to-day is estimated at from 17-20 million tons,  the annual output of soot being approximately -g- million tons.ct On the combustion of raw coal, the greater portion of thesulphur passes into the atmosphere in the form of sulphur dioxide gas, which, upon taking up moisture, becomes sulphurous acid and is changed by oxidisation into sulphuric acid.      When brought into contact with stonework by the agencies of rain, mist,  snow,  frost,  etc.,  the sulphurous and sulphuric acids attack the calcium carbonate or the magnesium carbonate in limestone,  the calcareous cements and free lime in sandstones, and the lime mortar used in buildings, causing a chemical change into sulphite or sulphate of calcium or magnesia respectively. The calcium sulphite or sulphate is more soluble than the natural calcium or magnesium carbonate in the stone; and the streaky whitish effect, often to be noted upon London buildings, results from the decay arising through water charged with these soluble salts running down and depositing them on surfaces of the stonework,  otherwise not seriously affected.     When the flow of water charged with these soluble salts is checked by any projecting feature, the soluble sulphate will generally be precipitated; and with the tarry sooty matter which also tends to collect and adhere in such sheltered positions, there gradually arises the formation of the black incrustations which are so common a cause of obliteration of detail and decay on limestone buildings in London.
0f An example of the effect of atmospheric impurity uponH in modern buildings has been observed in the Portland stonellublic pilasters on the towers of the Hew Public Offices in Whitehall, 1Ls which were erected in 1912, i-e. only 14 years ago.    The rateillJof decay is so rapid that the softer portions of the surface have been worn away to a depth of at least one-eighth of an inch.Its.lination jstone by Jrnment list.Ifage of     ^        As regards the magnesian limestone used at the Houses of jie due to   Parliament, although it may be considered satisfactory as logical       regards composition and crystalline structure, it has failed on, account of its geological faults, and variability of structure.     Photographs ITos. show thecleavage both in the more 30lid structural portions of the building, such as walls,  buttresses, piers, mullions,  etc., in which the stone is held down by soviet weight;    and also in the slender flying buttresses, pinnacles, turrets, etc., which have no superimposed load of stonework upon them. In cases where the line of separation between two sections of stone is on a steeply sloping plane  (technically known as a &quot;sliding vent&quot;)  the upper portion is liable to slide off the lower.    Such a tendency is evident on several of the large pinnacles above the parapets of the Terrace front, and involves the risk of heavy falls of stone  (see photographs Ho s. ) .In order to obtain supporting information as to the cause of the vast quantities of cleft stone in the Houses of Parliamenty examples with the fractured surfaces undisturbed were forwarded for examination to Sir Robert Robertson, the Chief Government Chemist, who found that the white crystal-line incrustation which was observed to exist along the planes of fracture contained a high proportion of calcium and magnesium sulphates, together with stone dust, etc.      The expansive force developed in the crystallisation of these sulphates, along the planes of cleavage and fracture, materially affects the opening of old sealed vents.illation &apos; In many stones - clearly obtained from inferior beds -II0 the atmospheric and general eroding influences have broughtKpherjio     out the pronounced tendency to lamination which existed in Eehcea.      the bed.s of the stone;    and in certain exposed positions there is    actual cleavage along the lines&apos; of lamination almost as pronounced as those due to geological faults. Along the Terrace or River front of the building can be seen a great number of instances of this tendency to lamination in the mullions and tracery of the windows, and in such instances, the lamination is more or less vertical, as the stones are face bedded.    ,(See photographs Hos. ).P&amp;&amp; due Another fruitful cause of damage is the expansioncaused by oxidisation of the iron spindles and cross-bars Josion        which are embedded in the stone-work of the pinnacles;    and l^tal. apart from this, the necking of the finials in many cases is too slender to contain a metal rod without risk of fracture by expansion, due to temperature only.In some cases,  solid masses of masonry weighing many tons, have been lifted to the extent of over an inch as a result of the corrosion and expansion of the iron due to moisture finding its way into the joints, and there are many instances in which the thickness of stonework between the iron dowels or standards and the outer air is so small that moisture gains access to the iron by direct percolation through the stonework itself.
The inevitable result is rust and oxidisation of the iron, with, consequent expansion and bursting of the stonework. Photographs Nos. show the effects of this class of failure^particularly where iron cross-bars are laid in the bed-joints of the masonry and are crossed in the joints below the cupolas and turrets which they lift bodily, displacing the whole of the stonework above.

3.      EFFORTS TO ARREST DECAY: CONSIDERATION OF VARIOUS STONE PRESERVATIVES.ods Trie Committee of 1861 referred the question ofidered     stone preservation to the professional chemists among their ommittee number, who reported that it was neither necessary nor 861. desirable to proceed with the general coating, -painting,oiling or washing of the whole structure, and that it would be sufficient to deal with the surfaces of stones already-showing symptoms of decay.      They recommended that where decay was due to the action of the weather on.exposed surfaces of cornices,  string courses,  etc., zinc or lead coverings should be fixed, and that in extreme cases the decayed stone should be cut out and replaced by new stone. The full Committee finally expressed the opinion that decay had in no case been arrested by any method of treating the stone,  and were unable to recommend any of the processes submitted to them, though they believed a solution could be found.      They considered the following methods of treatment deserved further investigation:-- For permanent protection:-(I) in application of silicates in various stages of concentration.(2) Applications of silicates in conjunctionwith various saline compounds intended to produce double decomposition.(3) Applications of hydrofluoric or hydrofluo-silicic acid or of saline compounds.(4) Applications of phosphoric acid and acid phosphates.(5) Applications of solutions of the alkalineearths or their bi-carbonates in water.For temporary protection:-Beeswax, paraffin, fossil gums,  resins, etc-, applied in the form of solutions in volatile solvents.A large number of stone preservative processes and suggestions were brought to the notice of the Committee, some of which were clearly attempts to solve the problem with little or no knowledge of the nature of stone or the problems involved in its preservation.      Others were put forward by chemists, based upon some scientific theory.      A number of the more likely of these were discussed at some length by the. Committee, and a further selection was made and submitted tc the Sub-Committee of Chemists for experimental examination and test.      Trials were made with them, lasting over a number of years,  but eventually not one of them was found of any real utility.The Committee also recommended that a further series of experiments should be undertaken under expert chemical supervision, but although it appears that these experiments were carried out, no record of the results can be traced.
v trials For some years previous to the Committee of 1861ir Charles Sir Charles Barry had carried out a series of trials with . - various compositions on portions of the new building showingsigns of decay.     His attention became fixed on three proprietary processes, and by comparative tests these three were f irtalDy reduced to one , an ingenious secret process which, after an experience of 18 months, Sir Charles Barry pronounced to be satisfactory0     At the time of his death in 1860, the adoption of this process for treatment on the new building was under consideration.     l.Ir* 3cM, Barry, who succeeded his father as architect for the building, was not, however, so confident as to the success of this process. After further trial without any satisfactory results the process was dropped, pending the appointment of the Committee of 1861.      Careful inspections have been made in recent years of the portions of the stonework known to have been treated, but no difference is noticeable in comparison with the surround-ing untreated stoneworks     The period of 18 months, upon which Sir Charles Barry would appear to have based his hopeful estimate of the results of the secret process referred to, is now known to be much too short for the formation of a reason-able judgment as to the effectiveness and permanence of any process of stone preservation^&apos;     His Majesty&quot;s Office of Works, since the establishment of its Historic Buildings and Ancient Monuments Section;, has tested a great number of so-called preservative processes.     Certain of these were proposed by chemists and included, among others, such processes as Professor ChurchTs Baryta Water treatment, the five classes of solutions of chemical salts for permanent treatments, and the solutions of organic substances for temporary treatments, which the 1861 Committee considered deserving of further investigations     The latter class at least had been consider-ably extended since the sitting of the committee     Those processes examined by the Office of Works include also a considerable, still-increasing list of proprietary compositions - a few more or less scientific in conception:    others quite empirical, and some unconscious repetitions, under new names, of formulas already tested and proved to be unsatisfactory*3ation In 1913, information was sought through H.M.^tiier       Ministers at Washington, Athens, Berlin and Borne, as to how iesc       the problem of stone preservation was being dealt,with in the countries they represented, but the replies add little to the knowledge which we already possess and only show that other countries are faced with the same problem, without having found a remedy,,tment To sum up, no practicable method of preventing theaiittee    decay of stone has yet been discovered.     An expert Committee re has, however, now been appointed by the Department of&apos;nation.   Scientific and Industrial Research to consider the whole-question.

OBVIATE OTGETPRECAUTIONARY MEASURESDuring the period from 1861 to 1913, nothing material was done either to investigate the causes of the decay or to find means of preventing it.      Systematic, hut partial, repairs were carried out as they became necessary, but it has since been found that the decay was proceeding immediately around the repaired stoneo    &quot;Since 1913, the building has been under closer observation, and in 1920., when large fragments of stone fell from the main entrance to the Victoria Tower, it was decided to undertake a systematic examination of the whole external surfaces of the building and to remove, by hand, any fragments of stone which were in danger of falling0The whole of the wall, surface has been examined at least once with the exception of the plain ashlar in the inner courts, which does not appear to involve serious danger, and this lit of       survey has shewn the enormous Extent and serious nature of the decay and cleavage in every portion of the building.     An example of the progressive character of the decay is shown on the Victoria Tower where certain of the decorative heraldic figures were carefully examined and passed as apparently sound in 1923, and yet on re-examination in 1924 were found to have developed fractures involving their entire removal (see photo-graphsPrior to 1920, at least 70 tons of loos^ fragments were repaired or re-fixed, and since that date a further 103 tons have been removed by hand as dangerous to Members and the Public *     Another 25 tons are ready for removal, making a total of 198 tons, or nearly 3,000 cubic feet of stone which have become detached, while a much greater quantity shews bad fractures and cleavages and will eventually have to be removed,.The effect of hand-picking, in denuding the building of its decorative features, is already noticeable in the case of the Central Tower, the pinnacle s on the Terrace, etc., and the time has arrived when a decision should be reached as to the character and extent of the repairs which must be undertaken,, The hand-picking of loose and dangerous fragments must proceed Jdins.     concurrently with any scheme of repair, but when carried outalone, it is uneconomical, as the cost of scaffolding is heavy and no permanent results are achievedo&quot;The total cost of &quot;hand-picking&quot; to date, including the provision of scaffolds, cradles, etc., is  34y000, to which -a       must be added  6,300 for general maintenance and minor -repairs to the stonework since 1914, making a total of  40,300, of which approximately  9,000 was for scaffoldinga
5&apos; PROPOSALS FOR THE RESTORATION OF THE STONEWORK. (a)   Area to be dealt with arid conditions governing repair.In considering a scheme for repair it is necessary to bear in mind the immense area covered by the building,  and also the height of the different sections which varies from 80 ft. - the general average height - to 330 ft-a- the height of the Victoria Tower.    The total superficial area of the masonry including external surfaces of all facades, towers, courtyards,  etc.,  is 900,000 square feet, and. the approximate cubic contents of stone is 7 75,000 cubic feet,  exclusive of the Cloister of St. Stephen&apos;s Chanel and Westminster Hall which will be dealt with separately.ions The following conditions should apply to any scheme ofing     repair:-1.-    The stone used for the repairs should harmonise as far as possible in texture and colour, with the existing stone, but should be free from its defects.2,    The general architectural design of the building should not be changed, and the Gothic detail should be preserved,, subject only to such modifications in execution as are proved to be necessary.3.    The faulty methods of construction in the originalbuilding,such as the use of iron tie-rods, standards and wedges, should be avoided.It is essential that non-corrosive metal should be used at all points where it is in direct contact with the masonry. Where vanes are held by heraldic lions,  such as at the foot of the lower slope of the angle tower in New palace Yard,  and the lions at the foot of the lower slope of the Central Tower,  the standards if renewed,  should be in bronze throughout,  as they pass through the bodies of the heraldic beasts.(o)    Extent to which details should be reproduced.n As the -Houses of Parliament is a period building,  it isessential in any scheme of repair to preserve the details so ary   far as is necessary to retain the architectural character of the building; but some modification may well prove necessary in view of the difficulty of carving In a hard stone, and also of the necessity for keeping the cost within reasonable limits.It should be possible,  for instance, where repair of detail    has to be undertaken,  to omit what may perhaps be regarded as unessential features,  such as the extreme elaboration of carving in parts of the building not visible from the ground... In some instances this appears to have been done by Sir Charles Barry himself,  unless the carving was omitted by inadvertence during the progress of the contracts.    Further, in order to make the repair of irretrievably ruined architectural features and details more permanent than they could ever be in their original form,  it may well be advisable to consider modifications in the execution of free-standing and over-elaborately carved ornament.
5 e.1 elMuch of the detail, such as the crowns standing on the small free shafts or pillars rising above the parapets on many of the facades of the building,  is so attenuated by cutting away as to be quite unfit and dangerous when executed in stone, particularly in the acid-polluted atmosphere of a modern city. Out of hundreds of these crowns in the original stone all except two have perished and have been reproduced in cast iron. Another example of unjustifiable freedom in carving is the open-work royal semi-crowns of various sizes in all parts of the building.    Some of these semi-crowns high up on the Victoria Tower are 3 feet in diameter and project 18 inches in free cut work.    Many have been removed in the process of &quot;hand-picking&quot;, and those which remain are a constant source of danger.    In the work of repair the external form of the semi-crowns can be preserved but,  instead of cutting away freely the whole of the interior,  they can be carved with an infilling to represent velvet, giving them a solid bedding into the faeework, and losing little,  if any,  of the architectural effect, while meeting the requisite conditions of strength, permanence and economy.Another typical form of excessive workmanship in stone, is the multiplicity of delicately carved stone ornament, so minute in scale that its effect   cannot be appreciated except from scaffolds.s &amp; The great numbers of niches for statuary, with theirpies     elaborately carved canopies, afford an excellent illustration of over-elaboration of detail.    The extreme is reached In the 3s*     canopies of the buttress niches round New Palace Yard,    Here, below the projecting canopy, with its minute tabernacle work, and interior vaults, carved with fine ribs and bosses,  is inserted an ogival cusped arch, with foliated crockets and finials,  in line with the face of the pier, while the space between the arch and the central line of the vault is enriched with a thin fretwork slab of stone, pierced with small splayed openings to portray perpendicular tracery.    Ail this elaboration and minute detail is in a space of about 24&quot; x 9&quot;, tho result being that the back portion of the delicate vault can only be seen from scaffolds or ladders, and by peering through the small tracery openings.Such extreme elaboration of detail, however true it may be to historic precedent,  is largely lost in the vast area of this great building.    Its inclusion must add greatly to the difficulties of permanent repair, and incidentally it has been held almost to detract from the aesthetic importance of the statues    themselves.    It is suggested therefore, that the visible parts of the canopy should remain unaltered, but that in all works of repair the inner half of the small vault of the canopy might be brought down to follow the line at the back of the lower arch,  the piercings in the thin slab above it being replaced by sinkings in the solid stone.    Some such modification of the detail should simplify and cheapen execution, and render the work more permanent, without any appreciable loss of effect.numerous examples of excessive elaboration even in the bolder features of the building,  could be given,  such as the jjgsit heraldic emblems over the first floor windows on the East front;  also the many beasts,gargoyles,  crockets, finials, etc, and the details of panelling throughout all fronts.
With the exception of certain minor and subsidiary features mentioned, no proposal is made that any portion of the detail should be omitted or essentially altered, but the skilful carvers could produce the same effect, as seen from below, with the expenditure of much less labour.    In this connection it is interesting to note that the amount of labour on the detail in the Houses of Parliament must have been approxi-mately double that expended on the beautiful Gothic detail of Liverpool Cathedral.fctition Hided [dards.Among the repetitive features are the gilded bannerets or standards, used as weather-vanes, placed on every available turret, or supported by stone lions and heraldic beasts.     In many positions these are out of sight, and useless as weather-vanes, being sheltered from the wind. . Many of these standards might be omitted in the   ultimate scheme of repair.sion It is doubtful whether the numerous slender detachede- shafts should be reproduced in a scheme of repair.   Fored example, between the buttressed turrets on the parapets therets. are small pillars 5 to 6 inches in diameter, bearing opencrowns 15 to 18 inches in diameter.   Flanking these on some fronts are still smaller standards, less than 3 inches in diameter in parts, bearing as terminal the orb.   Many of these have been removed and photographs have been taken to shew that the omission of the shafts on certain fronts would not be very noticeable from the street level.    If these shafts are to be reproduced each one must be cut from a single block of stone of sufficient size to contain the whole of the orb or crown.In some of the more inaccessible portions of the building the backs of the turrets and pinnacles have not been worked in such elaborate detail,as the fronts, and some economy might be effected by the adoption of some such method in the work of repair.It is proposed that the question of the general character and completeness of the repair of the structure should be re-ferred to the Fine Art Commission for their recommendation.(c) REPAIR OF STATUES.On all fronts the statues which are the work of various artists, have suffered severely from decay, lamination, orIred -      cleavage in the stone, but it is suggested that no attempt e- shou3.d be made to replace them by carved replicas.    They shouldced.       be regarded as monuments worthy of preservation and should be repaired by the methods usually employed by His Majesty&apos;s Office of Works, all the original work being preserved.    There are approximately 214 independent statues on the main facades of the building, representing the Sovereigns of England and the Saints and Patron Saints from the Norman Conquest to the time of Queen Victoria, the greater number being lifesize and stand-ing within canopied niches.    The series of statues upon the Colonnade in New Palace Yard are of Portland Stone and wereArmsteadexecuted in 1866 by Mr. E.M. Barry;  the remainder are of J. Thomas and his assistants.tinder the direction of in Anston Stone, andthe work it is proposed that, as each section of the building is scaffolded for&quot;the general repair, all the statues in that section should be subjected to minute scrutiny.    Any portions

Such stones can be dealt with in the future in the ordinary course of maintenance, advantage being taken of any remedy for the decay of stone which may be discovered by the expert committee appointed by the Department of Scientif-ic and Industrial Research.    Every stone, however, which has failed through cleavage or lamination or in which such incip-ient faults can be seen and which are likely to cause failure will be removed and reinstated.    But where it is unlikely that the opening of undeveloped vents and lines of cleavage would cause falls or structural Instability, renewal may not be necessaryo    Such stone, it is thought, can be dealt with, by re-bedding, dowelling with non-corrosive metal, groxxting up, etc.Courts, The plain ashlar surfaces of the inner Courts may not require much repair, but each stone should be sounded with a wooden mallet in order to ascertain whether cleavage has occurred behind the face.    Such failure has been discovered in seme instances, and it is estimated that approximately 10fi of the plain ashlar surfaces may require treatment.inater The stonework of Westminster Hall is not dealt with inthis report.    The original Reigate stone has been entirely refaced with a magnesian limestone, slightly softer and less difficult to work than Anston.    This stone is subject to a certain amount of decay and lamination, but has been repaired from time to time and no major repairs are now necessary.nsl The failure of the internal stonework is so slight com-ffork.       pared with the serious condition of the external stonework that it is not proposed to deal with it in this report.which are detached, or in danger of becoming detached, should be secured with hidden non-corrosive metal dowels, pins.or cramps - a method which has been successfully adopted in the case of a statue of King Edward I. at Carnarvon Castle, which presented a very similar problem.   Detached pieces should not be affixed by shellac, or by any of the special cements in general use, and any portions broken beyond the possibility of refixing or repair should not be reinstated in new stone unless their absence involves structural ?/eakness of the statue or greater liability to weakening or decay.Most of the statues are firmly fixed in position in the niche by a metal cramp let into the figure behind the should-er, and also into the main stonework.   Many of these cramps would appear to be of iron, and should be renewed in non-corrosive metal such as bronze or copper.The statue of Queen Victoria on the East front has a small space between the back of it and the face of the niche, which is filled with dirt and other debris, saturated with acid-bearing water, with the result that the surface of the stone is disintegrating at a rapid rate through the action of sulphuric acid and frost.    The space between the statue and the stonework of niche, in nearly all cases is very slight; and steps should be taken to prevent this cause of failure by seeing that such spaces are properly filled in.(d)    OMISSION  OF- PORTIONS  OF THE BUILDING FROMTHE GENERAL SCHEME.
6.    CHOICE OF STOKE FOR THE RESTORATION.In connection with the selection of a suitable material for the repairs, the following groups of materials have been considered:-(a) Natural stones.(b) Artificial stones.&apos;(c) Modern Terra Cotta,and in&apos; the course of the investigation into their relative merits, expert advice has been obtained from Mr, J. Allen Howe, the Assistant Director of the. Geological Liuseum, and Sir Robert Robertson, the Chief Government Chemist.(a)  NATURAL STONES.sian It is not possible to recommend the use of thestones.      original stone for the repairs to the building,particularly as no guarantee can be given that any Anston or other magriesian limestone will be free from the dangerous inherent defects previously described.      The Geological Museum in Jermyn Street was contemporary in building with the Houses of Parliament, and shows surprisingly little surface erosion.&apos;     Its facades are comparatively sheltered, but the selection of the stone for this building by experts, under the supervision of a distinguished geologist, has unquestionably procured a more evenly good quality of stone than might normally have been anticipated.      Such careful selection, however, has not prevented stone being used in which vents and cleavage lines can be detected.     Even on the scarcely touched Piccadilly front, below the cornice, and to a greater extent on the Jerrnyn Street front, the presence of vents can be detected from the street.     On the blind parapet of the former, and the plinth of the latter, erosion is more marked, and vent lines are well in evidence; while on the most exposed portion above the roof, the stone is found to be badly corroded and full of vents and cleavages.      77ere the whole building equally exposed, there is little reason to think that it would show greater immunity from this serious defect than the outer facades of the Houses of Parliament;    but its style protects it from the worst results of this defect.     All other buildings erected of magnesian limestone which have been examined show the same defects.&apos;&apos;te* There is no English stone reasonably suitableand readily adaptable to such highly elaborated masonry as that at the Houses of Parliament, and which can also be regarded as of adequate permanence and durability under existing atmospheric conditions.      Granite, which unquestionably is of sufficient durability, could not be, used, because of the extreme difficulty of carving Gothic detail such as exists to a great extent in the Houses of Parliament buildings     Further, granite, used in conjunction with    the existing magnesian limestone, would be completely out of keeping,  and would ruin the general effect of the building.
LIMESTONES.tland fee.The most durable and suitable of the available limestones is Portland stone.     Even this stone would be unsatisfactory for use in certain portions of the work at the Houses of Parliament,  on account of its variability and its inability to resist the attach of the sulphur acids in the atmosphere.      The fact that, under the influence of such acids, it quickly weathers to a dead white colour, as has already happened at the New County Hall, which was completed only in 1921, would render it unsuitable, even if it were proposed to reface the whole of the building. Apart from the question of its durability, however, the unsatisfactory effect of contrast in colour between dead-white weathered Portland stone and the warm yellow of Anston stone, could hardly be faced at the Houses of Parliament.SANDSTONES:.uleitline.Probably the most durable sandstone produced in Great Britain is Craigleith, which is extensively used in Edinburgh and has also worn satisfactorily at the Bank of England and the British Museum.      It has few,  if any, defects and is eminently suitable for the highest class of work in which the mouldings and enrichments are comparatively simple, and the carving in low relief only. It is, however, unsuitable for the Houses of Parliament on account of its extreme hardness and consequent great cost cf working.       The cost of quarrying would also be heavy owing to the position in which the best stone is situated in the quarry.     Moreover, the stone is too pale and cold in tone to be used in conjunction with Anston stone.6cl iff ei?The next sandstone for consideration is Stancliffe stone,  a close-grained micaceous grit, which is at present being worked at Darley Dale in Derbyshire, where it can be obtained in blocks of great size and fine quality.     It is extremely hard and durable, and these qualities, combined with its pleasing light yellowish drab colour, its crisp, clean texture and freedom from vents, faults, blotches or streakiness,  render it eminently suitable for use at the Houses cf Parliament.-     It is practically immune from atmospheric acid attack and has even been used for storage troughs for synthetic sulphuric acid.      Tests for cracking and crushing strength were extremely satisfactory, and an inspection of several buildings in London, Liverpool and Handiester has shown that where care has been exercised in its selection the stone is wearing remarkably well and satisfactorily withstands exposure to a polluted acid-laden atmosphere.   A notable example is that of St. George&apos;s Hall, Liverpool, where no measurable decay of any kind can be seen after 80 years exposure.In order to test the suitability of Stancliffe stone for use at the Houses of Parliament, one of the pinnacles of the New Palace Yard front has been reproduced in this material and cannot be distinguished at ground level from the Anston stone immediately adjacent.     The chief disadvantage of Stancliffe stone is its extreme
hardness, involving high costs for carving elaborate Gothic detail.       It is not, however, so hard as Craigleith stone, nor so difficult to work as granite.It is interesting and important to record that Staneliffe stone was favourably mentioned in the Report of the Commissioners who chose the stone for the Houses of Parliament and was actually specified by Sir Charles Barry as an alternative to Portland stone or magnesian limestone for the external facings of the building.        It was stated at that time that no defects had been noticed in the buildings for which it had been used, but Anston stone was selected as it lent itself mere readily to the elaborate carving.       The physical tests and chemical analysis made at that time,  showed that Stand if fe stone was practically non-absorbent, and less liable to disintegration than any other stone which was examined.ciington Doddington stone, another stone of similarone. character which was suggested for consideration, is less satisfactory than Stancliffe both on account of its wearing qualities and pinkish colour.        A sample of Doddington stone -worked into one of the pinnacles in New Palace Yard shows evidence of vents and faults which are likely in the future to develop into cleavages.(b)    ARTIFICIAL STONES.Much consideration has been directed to the possibility of using artificial stones.        The great majority are modern productions and their use has hitherto been confined to details of facades or to buildings of minor importance.        No building of great architectural merit has been constructed with artificial stone in London, much less a building with anything like the monumental and profusely enriched character of the Houses of Parliament.Artificial stones have not been used long enough, nor sufficiently extensively, for any assured judgment to be given as to their durability.    They are divisible into several groups, and are generally mixtures of sand or crushed or granulated stone, marble, granite, flints, etc, in a matrix or cementing material which may be either natural or manufactured.        Often they are found to be very hard and brittle, and some are more difficult to carve than natural stones.        If used to replace the tool-worked mouldings, carvings and enrichments of the Houses of Parliament,  it would be replacing a natural material by a plastic one.       Further, there are few exact repetitions in the enriched work in the Houses of Parliament and it is extremely doubtful whether, with the large number of moulds, casts, etc., which would be required, artificial stone would be more economical in the end than a natural stone.      Quite apart from this, the serious point arises as to the aesthetic incongruity of using for repair on an Anston stone building of the architectural character and^ quality of the Houses of Parliament, an artificial plastic material, produced and wrought by entirely different processes.        In any case, it is certain that tests carried out over long periods would have to be undertaken before any satisfactory assurance could be given that the functioning of two such dissimilar materials would prove permanent and satisfactory in the end.
(c)DERRA COTTA.Good terra cotta lias been proved to have a durability probably greater than that of any natural stone that could be used.        It has also a wide range of possible colour, within which it would probably not be difficult to match the tints of the existing Anstoh stone retained in the work.     Again, however, the question of the aesthetic incongruity, raised with regard to artificial stone, arises in considering terra cotta, for by the very excess of its resistance to atmospheric influences and impurities, and by its dull, unaltering texture, it would distinguish itself increasingly in time from the normally ageing and weathering stonework of the rest of the building, with which it would be in close juxtaposition. Practical difficulties as to its perfectmanufacture exist.      The question of the large number of moulds and templates, etc., required, enhanced as they would be by the risk in firing, would again probably make the total cost,  if terra cotta was used, as great as, if not greater than that of any sandstone. For thisreason the use of terra cotta cannot be recommended.lancliffe On the whole, therefore, Stancliffe stone isStone. recommended for the repairs, and in this recommendationfegested.    both Mr.Howe and Sir Robert Robertson concur.      The quarry from which it. is taken is in no danger of exhaustion, and steps would be taken to ensure adequate and regular supplies.       Arrangements would be made at the quarry for careful selection of blocks, and in order to minimise the risk of flaws and faults, and to economise in carriage, the blocks would be rough-shaped at the quarry, the finished work being carried out in the immediate vicinity of the Houses of Parliament.The question also arises as to what stone should be used for the portion of the stonework in the Cloister Court which is in need of immediate repair. Caen issuitable for the detail, but is liable to decay from atmospheric pollution.        Stancliffe stone would show too great a contrast in texture and colour in comparison with the existing Caen stone, and this contrast would bejoice of Jilmark lone forrjoist eiremphasised by time.is also doubtful if it would lend choice is, the same fine The Path stonesitself to the fine carving required.      The therefore, narrowed down to a limestone of grain as Caen, but of greater durability, do not weather satisfactorily in the London atmosphere. Portland and other good stones are unsuitable owing to their unsatisfactory colour or texture.       Of the best limestones those that approximate most nearly to Caen stone in eolour and texture are Ketton and Chilmark stones, the latter being the better of the two in these respects.       Ketton stone was used in the restoration of the nVest side of 7/westminster Hall and remains in good condition.      Chilmark is a siliceous oolite,  i.e. an oolite with an abnormal proportion of silica, and Salisbury one of our best preserved Cathedrals - was entirely built of it.        It has also been used in the Transept Fronts and the Chapter House at V/westminster Abbey, and has weathered reasonably well:    satisfactory strength can be obtained by careful selection at the quarry, and as the colour and general texture are very similar to that of Caen stone, it is recommended that Chilmark stone should be used for the repair of the Cloister Court.

Commencement should be made on the Terrace Front, and in the early years attention should be confined to those parts of the building in which the condition of the stone constitutes the greatest risk.
8 -    ESTIMATE Off- COST.imate The difficulty of preparing an accurate estimateproximate,    will be fully appreciated.      It is impossible to foreseehow much additional stone will show defects while the work is in progress or what changes may take place in working conditions, and the cost of labour and material.      There is. also the difficulty of deciding how much of the work must be regarded as masons&apos;  and how much as carvers&apos; work, the hourly rate for the former being 1/9-g-d.   (with additions forarcationtween working specific stones) , while for the latter it is fromsons5 anduwers&apos; 2/6d. to 3/Sd.      Ho definite trade regulations exist, but,in framing the estimate, it has been assumed that qualified carvers would only be required for the enriched or foliated work which cannot be executed from profiles or templates. It is also assumed that direct labour will be employed, and that the work can proceed continuously.The estimated cost of carrying out the restorationis  1,062,350, made up as follows:-Scaffolding tackle, unloading machinery,plant, electric hoists to towers and theestablishment of the necessary workshops  23,000Repair of the facades and parapets on the assumption that 25&apos;jc of the decorative work will require renewal and that the parapets will have to be entirely dismantled.

It will be seen,therefore,, that the estimated cost of the repairs represents roughly 8fb of the present day cost of erection., or %p per annum spread over 15 years, the time estimated as necessary for the completion of the work.
9.       SUMMARY.1.      The Houses of Parliament were erected during the years 1840 to lb52 in the Gothic style to the design of Sir Charles Barry, Anston stone being used for the building.2.      In 1861,  signs of decay having already been evident for some years, a Committee was appointed to consider the question.      The Committee were impressed with the seriousness of the decay, but did not refer to what has since proved to be the primary cause., namely geological faults and cleavages in the stone.      They were unable to discover any satisfactory preservative.3.      Recent investigations have confirmed the view that the decay is due to:-(a) Geological faults and cleavages in the stone;(b) the effect of atmospheric impurities resultingfrom the combustion of raw coal;(c) the corrosion of iron tie rods, dowels, &amp;c.,used in the construction, and(d) Pace bedding,  i.e. stone not placed on itsnatural bed.4.      No satisfactory stone preservative has yet been discovered, and the question is now being considered by an Expert Committee under the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research,5.      In 1920, the decay having been progressive during the intervening years, the condition of the stonework became so serious that it was necessary to carry out a systematic examination of the whole building and to remove by hand portions of the stonework which were in danger of fallings      This continual hand-picking has denuded the building of many of its ornamental features, and the time has now arrived to consider a comprehensive scheme of repair.6.      It is now proposed to replace all the defective stone, and after careful consideration of all possible materials, including artificial stone and terra cotta, it is recommended that Stancliffe stone, a micaceous sandstone, should be used for the repair of the main portion of the building and that the Cloister Court should be repaired with Chilmark stone, which is more in keeping with the existing Caen stone.7.      The question whether all the minute detail of the building should be reproduced in the repairs  (there being of course no alteration in its general appearance) is a matter for special consideration.      It is proposed to seek the advice of the Pine Arts Commission as to the general character of the scheme of repair from the architectural point of view.8.      The cost of the proposed repairs is estimated at  1,0 62,350, to be spread over a period of from 12 to 15 years.      It is proposed to ask for  40,000 for the first year, and to Increase the annual provision when experience has been gained in carrying out the work-
