ent is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.] 278IBPrinted for the Cabinet    June 1926.CONFIDENTIAL.[N 2811/1687/38]MEMORANDUM RESPECTING ANGLO-SOVIET RELATIONS.I THE situation which confronts us has been created by the action of the SovietGovernment in giving the special permission which is necessary under its regulations for the transfer to this country of funds in aid of the general strike.The general strike was, of course, an illegal and unconstitutional act repre-senting a serious &quot;threat to established order and our system of government, and, whether the money came from the Soviet Treasury or from other sources, the granting of permission for its remittance amounts to a breach of the undertaking on winch the Trade Agreement is based; to refrain from any hostile actions or under-takings against Great Britain. We have protested against it briefly but firmly, and the question is whether any further action would be useful or beneficial to this country.It is necessary, first, to say something about the position of the so-called Soviet Government and its connection with other bodies in Russia. It differs from all other Governments in not being in reality the supreme authority; it is more in the position of a special committee of administrators appointed to perform certain specified tasks and to represent Russia officially abroad. There is an elaborate hierarchy of Soviets from which the Soviet Government constitutionally issues, but in reality the effective rulers of Russia are the controlling authorities in the Communist party, the only political party which is allowed to exist. The leaders of the party rule it with a rod of iron, and the policy pursued by the party is the policy decided upon by its leaders. The most important organ of the party is the Politbureau, which is the real Cabinet of Russia.The Communist party is, of course, the life blood of the Communist Inter-national; it is unnecessary to say much on that point, which everybody will admit. What is its actual connection with the Soviet Government so-called, that Council of Administrators or Commissars already mentioned ? The President of the Council, the most important person in the Government, is Rikov, who is a member of the all-important Politbureau. Here is the connection established at the most central point of all. Kamenev and Trotsky, other members of the Government, are also members of . the Politbureau. The most important questions of policy are referred to the Politbureau, wdiich controls, in fact, the actions of the Soviet Government. Even such a matter a.s the granting of an important concession to foreign industrial enterprise is submitted to the Politbureau. On the other side it controls the Third international. Zinoviev, the notorious president of the Third International, is a member of the Politbureau, and the Politbureau controls the International by means of a delegation of five of its own members, including Stalin, who is general secretary of the Communist party and perhaps the most important of the rulers of Russia. Clearest of all signs, of the intimate connection between the Soviet Government, the Communist party and the Third International is the fact that Rikov, the Prime Minister, as it were, in the Government, is a member of this delegation from the party to the Third International. He, in fact, and Kamenev also, has actually an official position in the Government, the Politbureau and the Third International.It is unnecessary to labour the point further. As Mr. Ramsay MacDonald said in his note to the Soviet Government on the famous Zinoviev letter : &quot; No one who understands the Constitution and relationships of the Communist International will doubt its intimate connection and contact with the Soviet Government.&quot;But it may be well to add that the trades unions in Russia, from whom the money is supposed to have come, are, Tn effect, Government institutions or party institutions the two being in essence the same thing and not the product of independent enterprise. They actually have important Government functions. Direct connection between them and the Politbureau is established by the fact that 3503   [14708]
Tomski, chairman of the Trades Unions Central Council, is a member of the Politbureau. The Red International of Labour Unions is simply a different form of the Third International working through different machinery.The subordinate local Soviets are responsible, not merely for local interests, but for the execution within their districts of the orders of the Central Government; they form the highest authority in those districts and though the Soviet Government may argue that they have no responsibility for what they do, their actions can hardly be regarded as anything but Government actions. The Moscow Soviet, in issuing a fervent appeal in favour of the general strike, was, therefore, guilty of an act to which His Majesty&apos;s Government have every right to take strong exception.Now we come to the source of the money and the responsibility of the Soviet authorities in connection with its remittance here. We have seen categorical denials that any of the money sent to this country was provided from Soviet State funds; it is alleged, so far as support for the general strike is concerned, to have come from the Red Trades Unions funds and collections from workers, and as regards support for the miners, from the same source, and especially from the wages of the Russian miners. There are one or two elementary calculations which throw some light on the matter. There are some 2 million industrial workers in Russia, and their average monthly wage is just over 40 roubles, or  4 in other words, the monthly industrial wage bill is nominally  8 million; but according to the same authority (the &quot; Trud,&quot;&apos; the organ of the Central Council of the Red Trade Unions) the purchasing power of that wage bill is only  4,600,000, or 47s. a head per month. Further, the latest official Avholesale index for all goods is 200, taking the 1913 level as 100 in other words, the industrial worker in the Soviet Union gets 23s. Qd. pre-war value per month the equivalent of say 37s. a month or 9s. 3d. a week in Great Britain at the present moment. It says much for the spirit of self-sacrifice among the Russian workers if they are surrendering, as we are told they are voluntarily doing, a part of this trifling wage for the benefit of their British fellow trade unionists. It is as a matter of fact.known that the contributions are levied under compulsion, often without the consent of the men, and at times directly against their wishes. This is not surprising, if only because the non-payment of wages in Russia is becoming-acute. The poverty of the State trusts for which they mostly work is such that wages are falling into arrears.When we turn to the funds for the miners the Soviet assertions are even more surprising. Miners in the Soviet Union are the worst paid of all industrial workers (except possibly the textile workers), and their wages are officially reckoned at 36 roubles a month.* Now no less than 4 million roubles have been transferred to this country, alleged to have been subscribed by the Russian miners for their fellow workers in this country, that is to say, the entire wages for one month of 111,000 miners and it is believed that there are less than 100,000 miners in the whole union.*It is therefore scarcely credible that the amount of money raised, now amounting to some  380,070, can have been raised by contributions from the workers&apos; wages, certainly so far as concerns the supposed contributions by the miners. The funds at the disposal of the trades unions themselves have, it is acknowledged, been drawn upon in anticipation of subscriptions by individuals. We cannot say whether their available funds are or are not sufficient for the purpose. If not, the responsibility of the Soviet authorities is engaged in yet another form, for the banks are State institutions, and advances by them therefore represent official loans.If any part of the money remitted here came from Government funds, it might be thought that a corresponding item would have to appear in the budget but the Soviet budget, though copious in statistics, is not lucid. The last budget includes the following items : Million roubles.Reserve funds    ... ... .. ...       125-3Subsidies funds  ... ... ... ...        75-6State Treasury operations ... ;. ...      212 - 8Deductions for local budgets ... ...      245 - 6(This last, by the way, is a new item this year.) Now all these items may be genuine or they may not; it is impossible to tell, since only the vaguest explanations are given and no details of actual expenditure but there are 658-3 million roubles (nearly 66 million sterling) which can be practically allocated at will for any purpose the Soviet Government may choose.* Information just received shows that these figures are not correct. There were 388,000 workers in the mining industry on the 1st January, 1926, and wages have risen to 48 roubles a month
One thing only can be definitely brought home to the Soviet Government. By a law dated the 14th April of this year (No. 170 of 1926), for sums over 100 roubles a month &quot; the remittance or. transfer of currency values abroad shall only be allowed on permission being given by the Special Currency Commission of the Peopled Commissariat of Finance,&quot; and then only on proof of the necessity of payment for imports, covering current commercial expenses, and &quot; for fulfilment of official orders, &amp;c.&quot;   It is on the ground of this law that our protest has been based.What this all amounts to is that technically the so-c,alled Soviet Government, as such, can produce a case, apart from the permission given for the transfer of the money, which, while it cannot be accepted at its face value, is difficult to refute.No other Government in the world would have received or expected the patience we have shown to the Soviet Government, but we have found it best not to take them or their offences against international comity too seriously. Unquestionably they have no sort of claim on our consideration, and our attitude towards them must be determined purely on motives of expediency. They are, as will be realised from what has already been said, a misnamed body; they are not themselves as a body responsible for the policy of Russia, but they are the representative body with which the outer world has to deal, and, as responsible to a large degree for the administra-tion of Russia and the satisfaction of her practical needs, their interest is sometimes divergent from the interest of the pure revolutionary and disturber of the order and welfare of other countries, who finds his expression in the Third International. The International has expended great efforts and spent vast sums of money, which must of course have been raised by taxation, currency inflation, the profits of the State foreign trade monopoly and other Government means, but its success has been poor compared with its efforts, and there has always been the hope that the practical considerations of Russian welfare would tend gradually to assume greater import-ance with the authorities than the rather unprofitable ambition of seeing revolution, misery and disease spring up in every foreign country. Since one cannot but believe in the ultimate power of sanity there is still hope of this kind, and the value of contact between Russia and the outer world lies to a great extent in its effect in increasing the importance of practical considerations, bringing the rulers of Russia into touch with outside opinion and bringing home to them the obstacles which the revolutionary side of their work puts in the way of their practical efforts to improve the welfare of their country.This is all to the good of the world in general as well as of Russia. From the point of view of the more immediate interest of this country, there is this to be said in favour of not breaking off such-relations as Russian policy allows us to maintain. A certain amount of trade is already in existence between this country and Russia. Its value to us in our present state of need cannot be dismissed as negligible and it may be hoped that it will gradually increase. British firms have accepted orders on credits covering a considerable period, and these orders, or the payment for them, will no doubt be lost in the event of a complete breach. What, on the other hand, is to be gained by a breach ? Our main ground of complaint is the propaganda of the Third International. How will that be stopped if relations are broken off? It is no doubt facilitated by the presence of a diplomatic mission and of trade agencies in this country. But sufficient organisation to maintain it will always be maintained or created anew and money can always be sent in by one channel or another. Our war experience is enough to show that nothing short of a complete censorship and a financial and economic control scrutinising and allowing or forbidding every business transaction, will suffice to prevent it. In some ways it is even probable that a breach will lead to an increase of antagonism and an intensification of propaganda. The rulers of Russia will feel that nothing else is to be gained from us but the delightful spectacle of revolution and ruin, and the counter-attractions of practical economic advantage to Russia will disappear.It must, furthermore, not be forgotten that Russia is almost invulnerable economically just as she is invulnerable militarily. She is not to be feared in either aspect and neither is she to be attacked with success. She may cry aloud for foreign credits or loans with which to build up her economy, but she can exist without them, and a rupture of trade relations cannot deal her a blow which she cannot support, and support with ease. She would not even be incapacitated if other countries sucn as Germany and the United States were to follow us. And it must be remembered that the Russian, and especially the Bolshevik mind, does not attach the same degree of importance to material considerations as we should do ourselves.Foreign Office, June 16, 1926.
