f THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PP.OPERTY OP HIS BRITAHNIO MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT S3CREJVCP .254 (26). CABINET. ^ &amp;Hoather Burning; (Scotland) Bill,. Memorandum by tho Secrotary for Scotland.This Bill, introduced by a private Member, has now passed through tho Houbo of Commons and awaits second reading, in the Houso of Lords.A Departmental Committee reported in 1921 in favour of legislation of this character.     Tho Bill extends the period both in the spring and in the autumn within which heather burning may take place, and also empowers the Board of Agrioulture for Scotland by order to regulate tho burning of heather in oases where a tenant is precluded by the terms of his lease or otherwise from burning the heather adequately,Tho Bill goos far to meet the desires of farming interests in Scotland, and I am anxious that it should be passed into law before the Recess.I think that it would be of advantage that tho Bill should be taken in tho House of Lords as a Government Bill and I should be glad to receive the approval of my colloagues to this proposal.&apos;JOHN GILMOUR&apos; .26th Juno, 1926.
