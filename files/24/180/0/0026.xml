(THIS DOCUMENT IS  THit PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVJfAllii?!?)-SECRES-g.P. 225 ( 86 ) .CABINET.COMPOSITION 03* THE COUNCIX OF THE IMGUE 03? NATIONS memorandum BY THE CHANCELLOR OP THE DUCHY Off LANCASTER.I venture to circulate to my colleagues a memorandum on tho recent prooeedings at Geneva in case it may be of Interest.R tCo4tli June, 1926.Memorandum on the Composition, of tho Council of the League.The Committee on the Composition of the Council provisionallyaocepted a draft proposed by ae on the following linesthe non-permanent members are to be enlarged from six to nins;    thay are to hold office for threo years;    threa to be sleotad each year;not more than three out of the nine non-permanent members are to be re-eligible, and that only if the Assembly so decide by a two-thirds ma-ferity. &quot; Tlae remainder are not to be re-eligible for &amp; poriod of three years after the expiration of their teirmjthe non-parmanent members are to take office immadiate-ly on election and not as at present on the 1st January following,  and at any time the Assembly mey, by a two-thirds majority,  decide to proceed to a new election of all the non-permanant members of the Council on such terms as it shall then lay down.My colleagues will observe that in principle this is much tho same as the scheme which they approved before the Geneva meeting, though it differs from that plan in some of its details.      The effect will be ^hat each year three non-permanent members will be elected, one of them being re-eligible.      Some protest was made against the increase in number of the non-permanent members, and Particularly by so much as three additional members.      But the number was adhered to because it was felt that if there were to beCopy Wo.0St)(i) (Hi(iii)-1-
en affective representation on the Council of the general tody of members of the League, not less than two fresh members ought to be sleeted each year, otherwise the chance for the average member of the League to serve on the Council would be too remote.      If then the term   of office is to be throe years there must be at least six   non   ra-eligible members of the Council.      If the term were to be less then the number might be reduced.     But this turned out to be impracticable in view (i) of the strong feeling that a lass term than throe years would be ineffective, and (ii) of the fact that the Assembly had more than once decided in favour of a three years term for the non-permanent members.      It was, therefore, generally accepted that there must be six non re-eligible members of the Council, and it did not seem practicable to have less than three re-eligible.      fho object of having re-eligible members was to give some chance of satisfaction to aspirants for permanent membership.      These included Spain and Poland.     But to have created only two re-eligible seats, both for European Powers, would have caused serious discontent to the Asiatic and American members of the League.     At least one re-eligible seat ought to be available for them.      In spite,  therefore, of the criticisms of the Italian and Swiss delegations,  it was decided to have three re-eligible members.      The result is a Council of fourteen now, and whan Russia and the United States come in, a Council of sixteen.      That is undoubtedly too large,  though perhaps not unworkably so.     In any case,  for the reasons given,  I do not see how it is possible to have lass than the nine members on which tho Committee decided.Nothing has yet bean said formally about permanent membership, but it was evident from the debates that the only two c oral tries who were really in favour of extending the number of permanent members beyond the Great Powers were Spain and Brazil.    Poland would certainly press her claim if any extension was agreed to, but she was satisfied not to press it so long as only Great Powers
ware to &quot;be permanent members.      The same was avowedly true of China, and. the only other applicant, tarsia, may be disregarded. If, therefore, the question comes to be decided at the end of June, I should anticipate that the worst that can happen will be a minority of two against, and. an/abstention of two or three others.      If between this and than Spain and Brazil can be induced to accept the inevitable there will be a unanimous decision against extension of permanent membership.So far, no member of the Committee has voted against any of the proposals which wa have provisionally agreed to.    They are to be officially reviewed at our next meeting fixed for June 28th.and in the meantime Brazil and Spain have, of course, reserved thoirvsorights and,/in a half-hearted way, have China and Poland.      Swedenreserved its right to object to any extension of the non-permanentrepresent at iveor permanent members,  but her/ privately informed me that    she will not persevere in their position unless there is an extension of permanent membership.The German representative aocepted all these proposals, and there seems good ground for thinking that whatever happens Brazil will not press her olaim so far as to veto the German candidature. If she does, under tha provisions agreed to,  she can and will be excluded from the Council.      I regret that the Committee declined to consider the proposal for proportional representation on the ground that it added needless complication.,Finally it should be mentioned that we promised three non-permanent 3eats to South America and oxpresSed approval of adequ.ate representation for Asia - whatever that may mean.
I believe that this is on the whole the most satisfactory sattlament that could be hoped for,  and if we can get it definitely laid down by the Council and Assembly that there is to be no extension of the permanent members beyond Germany, Russia and the United States, it is to ba hoped that this controversy will not be renewed in future years.      It is certainly a very deleterious one for the working and prosperity of the League.     As it is the present difficulty may and probably will lead to the withdrawal of Spain and Brazil if not from the Loagua itself, at least from all active Participation in its work*R.
