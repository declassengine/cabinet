Note by the President of the Board of Trade.I circulate the attached extracts from Minutes of the last meeting of the Board of Trade Advisory Council, giving the reports of representatives of different Industries on the effects of the coal stoppage, and on the probable period for which those industries will be able to carry on. I think my colleagues will be Interested to see these extracts in advance of the usual full report of the proceedings.(Intldc) P.C-L.Board of Trade, 7th June,1926,
[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet,   June 1926,SECRET.CP. 246 (26).Previous paper : CP. 234 (26).CIRCULATED BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA.AFGHANISTAN.I wish to draw the particular attention of my colleagues to the despatch from Sir Francis Humphrys, His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Kabul, which I circulated the other day (CP. 234 ^26)). They will remember that earlier hi the year an acute Russo-Afghau crisis arose over the forcible occupation by the Russians of an island in the River Oxus which had for many years been in the de facto possession of the Afghans. Afghan amour propre was inflamed, and it. was with the utmost difficulty that Sir F. Humphrys succeeded in dissuading the Amir from the suicidal course of declaring war, and in persuading him to accept the Russian offer of a Commission of enquiry, Afghan possession of the island being resumed in the meantime.- The immediate question with which the present despatch deals is, what is to happen if the enquiry results in a deadlock which&apos;the Russians solve by again ejecting the Afghan occupying force ? Both parties are represented in equal numbers on the Commission, aud there is no impartial Chairman. It is unlikely that either party will relinquish its claims, and a deadlock may occur at any moment. There is, of course, no certainty that, if and when it does, the Russians Mall resort to force ; but if they do, it is tolerably certain that the Afghan war fever will recur, aud we ought to be ready with a policy.It will be agreed th-it our interests imperatively require that the Amir should be dissuaded from a war in which (although we have no commitments to him) there would be grave risk that we should eventually become involved. Sir F. Humphrys&apos; view of the immediate result of such a war is indicated in para. 4 of his despatch. I may supplement his criticism of the Afghan army by some remarks of our Military Attache at Kabul (who last summer made a more extensive tour in Northern Afghanistan than any British officer has made for many years, if ever) : &quot; The regular army lacks the discipline and organisation necessary to take the field efficiently. At the same time it has none of the good qualities of a tribal organisation. In the future, therefore, as in the past, the Afghan regular troops will fail whenever put to the test.&quot;The knowledge that a similar state of affairs existed then made Our commitments to Afghanistan throughout the 10 years for which they lasted a constant embarrassment to the Government of India. Successive Amirs declared that they required no assistance from British troops, and indeed it was (and still is) more than doubtful whether British troops could enter Afghanistan even to assist the Afghans. What they asked for, and what they will, no doubt, go on asking for, was arms and munitions. But the possession of these would merely encourage them in their overweening self-confidenpe and increase the risk of defeat ; and it is obvious that arms given to them would be arms given to the enemy.For these reasons, therefore, which are commonplaces in the history of Anglo-Afghan relations, it cannot be our policy to allow the Amir to go to war, if we can prevent, still less to encourage him to do so by arming him. And, in fact, the real defence of the Afghan frontier, when it has seemed to be threatened, has been conducted by diplomacy at St. Petersburg. This is the defence which Sir P. Humphrys advocates now. Will it succeed (.1) in restraining the Amir, (2) in moving.the Russian Government to surrender ? It may be gathered from para. 7 of Sir F. liumphrys&apos; despatch that he is not pessimistic as regards the former. He has acquired great influence with the Amir, and his remarkable combination of frankness and tact have undoubtedly inspired the Afghans with a growing belief in British good faith; and it may well be that his influence will again turn the scale in favour of good sense.1251     100  cs.2g
BOARD   OP    TRADE   ADVISORY   COUNCIL.Meeting on 5rd June, 1926.Extracts from Minutes dealing with the effect of the coal stoppage on Industry.Board of Trade,3rd June, 1926.
CONFIDENTIAL.IRON AND STEEL - MR. DORMAN (President of the National Federation of Iron and Steel Manufacturers).The Production of steel ingots and castings amounted to 661,000 tons compared with 784,100 tons in March and 597,600 tons in April 1925; the decline in production between March and April was largely due to Easter holidays.As a result of the general strike called by the TradeUnion Congress there has been a general cessation of opera-tions in the heavy Iron and Steel Trade.   Most blast furnaceshave been either damped down or blown out, although some firms have found it possible to operate one or two furnaces on slack blast.    Steel Plants and Rolling Mills are universallyout of commission.Most Constructional Engineering firms are able to carry on for a short period on part time, but their operations are naturally dependent on the receipt of supplies of plain material.    There are very few definite enquiries for immediate business in this branch of the industry.The Wire trade is practically at a standstill, there being J no enquiries for home deliveries owing to the stoppage in the coal mines, ^nd Continental manufacturers, particularly the Germans, are obtaining all the export&apos;  orders, which are being placed at prices much below those which British manufacturers can quote.   There are: a few Wire Mills operating in the Country on part time.Some of the Galvanised and Black Sheet Works in the country are working on short time, but this wiAl *nly be possible for a further period of P^S weeks.-1-
CONFIDENTIAL. IRON AND STEEL - MR. JOHN BftKfiR.  (of the iron and -Steel Trades Confederation).There is little to report in connection with the iron and steel trades that is of much service under the circumstances of the short supply of coal,STEEL     -   SIR ARTHUR BALFOUR.  (Chairman and Managing Director of     A. Balfour and Company, Limited, Sheffield,  Che.chairman of High Speed Alloys, Limited, etc.Y-lth regard to the Coal Strike, fortunately a great number of firms in Sheffield have gone in for Electric power and they are using from the big power stations who are fairly well supplied with coal.    That has kept up the output of the lighter Industries of Sheffield very satisfactorily.    The heavy steel industry,  of course, is beginning to close down but an extraordinary amount of steel and steel goods has been produced in Sheffield in the last four -weeks in spite of the strike and is being shipped.   The closing down is not very serious yet. I daresay another fortnight would affect a good many firms but, in my own case, I can manage quite well for another three weeks in all my works ,NON-FERROUS METALS - SIR C^CIL BULL.  (Chairman, L ondon Me ta I Ex cha.nge) .I&apos;i th the exception of tinplates and galvanised iron, the base metal works are going considerably in excess of b0%,    That I think is largely due to the fact that when the last Goal Strike occurred a great many works put in apparatus for using oil, which is very suitable for many of the processes, and I think that that has helped them very much, end will enable them to continue, provided transport, is available,  for some time to come -for more than three weeks.
ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING - sir phlLiP NASH. (Chairman of Metropolitan-Vickers Electrical Company,Limited).In about a fortnight1s time the effect of the coal stoppage is hound to be felt for two reasons:    one is that there will be difficulty In getting outside supplies of material, and, secondly, it is almost Impossible to get rid of the finished products of big plant.    Buyers cannot take delivery and there is difficulty about moving these heavy pieces and so in about a fortnight    or three weeks&apos; time the industry will gradually begin to have to turn off men and close down by departments.    I have not heard of anybody closing at all up to date, neither in the manufacturing plant nor in cables, but it is bound to start In a fortnight or three weeks.COTTON - COLONEL SEDDON BROWN.(Managing Director of the Amalgamated Cotton Mills Trust limited and of Horrookses, Crewdson and company, Limited).Since the Advisory Council last met trade has been worse than ever.    It is difficult however, to be able to estimate how much of the increased depression in trade is due to ordinary causes and how much must be attributed to the General Strike which took place   and the Coal Strike which is at present on.    At the moment buyers appear to have absolutely no confidence at all.    Strike clauses have to be insisted upon in all   contracts and It is very difficult for anybody to negotiate business.
CONFIDENTIAL. .-&quot; 121TEXTILES: WOOL - COLONEL WILLEY.   (Ex-President of the Federation of British Industries).There is no doubt that the present position is one virtually of complete stagnation, that is to say, new orders have completely ceased and the actual position of employment is bad because it is short time, which has more an immediate effect than complete unemployment.   Although some factories will be shut down entirely,  the majority will be working short time and that has the two-fold effect of reducing the earnings capable of distribution and raising the operating cost, and, therefore, it is making still more difficult the case of competition......   As regards the actual effect of the strike,there is plenty of coal in the Wool Textile Trade as a whole. There is no fear of a lack of coal, it is lack or orders.TEXTILES: WOOL. - MR. ANDREWS.  (Ex-President of The British Wool Federation) .We are not so much troubled with the position with regard to the coal situation as we are about cancellations.   The cancellations have been so heavy.   The 50% allowance of coal, of which we appear to have sufficient, is more than sufficient to produce a good supply.ARTIFICIAL SILK - MR. ADDIS ON.  (Director ofGourtaulds.. Limited) ,Generally speaking,  the Home Trade has been remarkablygood, and customers have shewn great willingness to acceptall deliveries of Yarn.    It is, however,  doubtful whetherbusiness can be maintained at this level,  as the Authoritiesare in all districts tightening up restrictions on theconsumption of coal.   Apart from this,  the future outlook isdistinctly hopeful, and it is felt that,  if the Coal Strikecould be.settled, there would be a heavy demand for artificial silk from the Hosiery section.-4-
CHEMICALS   -    MR.  PERRY.(Ex-Chairman of the Association of British Chemical Manuf ac tur er s).Se far I cannot say that the shortage Of coal has seriously interfered with manufacturers, hut every day now the difficulties are Increasing, and increasing more and more rapidly.    I think that within three weeks from now, and perhaps even less, the entire industry will be brought to a standstill if fresh supplies of coal are not available.RUBBER    -   MR. JOHNSTON. (Managing Director of North British Rubber Company).Until the Coal question is settled and matters resume the normal, It is unlikely that the distinctly favourable conditions in this Industry obtaining a few months ago will return,POTTERY   -    MR. HOLLINS. (Financial Secretary of the National Society of Pottery Workers).As to the position of things so far as the coal stoppage is concerned, from all reports we are not closing down quite so quickly as in 1921, but at the same time each week large numbers of factories are closing down on account of the uoal, which you know is an imported raw material for us.I should think perhaps one-third of our factories are closed down.    A few factories did take their workpeople back last week but only for two or three days.    They are back again this week in unemployment and each day it becomes more serious with us,    I believe some factories may carry on for another five or six weeks but I suppose that in the next fortnight or so the majority of firms will be closing down.
SHIPPING - SIR ALLA]j AJDJRSON.   (Ex-President of the Chamber of Shipping, and a Director of the Bank of England) .The tonnage laid up on the 1st April, 1926, was nearly 12% lower than on the 1st January and Qfc better than twelve months earlier.   There has, however, been an increase in unemployed tonnage as the result of the strike and many ships are held up in this country under the Emergency Regulations. The tonnage laid up in the South Vales ports on the 1st April, 1926, was 13,214 net tons.  on the 29th May,  the total&quot; was 166,750 net tons.F.B.I. - SIR MAX MUSPRATT.  (President of the Federation of British Industries, Director of United Alkali Company, Limited).As far as coal position is concerned,  the large coal consuming industries have been running at a little over fifty per cent, of their normal capacity ever since the beginning of May, and they can run on, I think most of them,  for two to three weeks longer at about that figure, but after that it means almost complete closing down in at any rate the industries that consume large quantities of co8l.As far as the export business was concerned, the fifty per cent, allowance of coal, plus accumulated stocks, had enabled the country as a whole to execute almost every order that was on its books.    Of course,  the exception is the very heavy tradesj but on the whole Sir Max Musptratt did not think this country had lost an appreciable amount on day to day or week to week business or gone short upon any of its contracts for ordinary supplies.    That had been possible owing to the fact that manufacturers had been preparing for the emergency by laying up fairly large stocksj in many cases carrying them in various parts of the world.   At any rate,  in the  chemical
industry he did not think a single order had been lost; that was highly gratifying and, needless to say, they wanted to maintain that position if they possibly could.    In regard to the Industries in which electricity was used and obtained from the big power stations, the position up to the present had been extremely good*.GENERAL TRADE    -    MR. MACHIN.(President of the Association of British Chambers of Commerce;   Director of Crosse and Blackwell, Limited).In London, I believe that many, like myself, can go on for three or possibly four weeks eking out supplies as we are doing without substantial additions to our cost, but if the coal stoppage lasts say beyond a month, unless we are able to get additional supplies of coal, it will cause considerable trouble and lead to cutting down our work and the discharge of our workpeople.RAILWAYS - SIR H. 7/ALKER.(General Manager of the Southern Railway).There Is no reason why railways should not be able tocarry on, so far as coal is concerned, for another eight or ten weeks at least.    Of course we have cut down the services very considerably and each week as we progress towards the holidayseason the public will suffer more Inconvenience, which unfortunately we cannot remedy, but we do not anticpate thatwe shall have to cut our services more than we have done upto the present either for goods or passengers.
