C A B I H ii ILEGISLuiTTOA7 C OlvlidI TgJJIS..1.      At their Meeting on May 19th 1926 (Cabinet 33(26)Conclusion 7) the Cabinet agreed to refer the question oflegislation as to Trade Unions raised in the lord chancellor&apos;s Memorandum (CP. 204(26)) to a CabinetCommittee composed as follows:-The Lord Chancellor      (in the Chair) The Chancellor of the -Ebcchequor The Secretary of State for Homo Affairs The Secretary of State for War The Secretary of State for India The First Lord of tho Admiralty The President of the Board of Trade The Minister of Laboxir The Attorney General,2.      The Committee are satisfied that a Bill should beintroduced into Parliament as soon as practicable.    without legislation it is impossible for the Governmont to keepits promise of protection to those members of Trade Unionswho continued at work during the General Strike; and thereare other matters with which it is desirable to deal whilethe memory of the strike is fresh in tho public mind.    if legislation is postponed until after the holding of an enquiry, it may never be passed.3,      At the same time tho Committee think it essential that any legislation which may bo introduced in the near future should be such as will command  the support .
of the groat mass of public opinion,  including that of the moo crate trade unionist,, and  that it shall not be capable of being represented as having a party character. They have accordingly confined their proposals within narrow limits.ILLEGAL 4.    Legislation on the lines of the Illegal StrikesSTRIKES.Bill, already approved in principle by the Cabinet (Cabinet S3 (26) Conclusion l) is the most tirgent matter. The effect will be to declare a strike which Is not directed solely to the maintenance or improvement of the conditions of the industry in which the strikers are engaged, but is intended to intimidate or coerce the Government or the community, to be illegal, ,and to provid that such a strike shall not have the protection of the Trado Disputes Act 1906 and  that the applioation of trade union funds in support of it may bo rostrained by the Court at the instance of the Attorney General, or,in Scotland, of the Lord advocate.SECRET 5.     Recent events have produced a strong public demandBALLOTS.for legislation providing that the protection of the Trade Disputes Act shall not apply to a strike not sanctioned by a seoret ballot of the union affected. Such a provision is contained in the rules of many of the registered unions; but it is often violated (s.g, by the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen and the Miners1 Unions in the recent strike), and even when a ballot is taken, secrecy is not always sedured.-,   Moreover registration is optional and about one half of the trade unions are  still unregistered.
6c      2he main argument against the prinoiple of a com-pulsory secret ballot is based on the view that the surest way of diminishing the nitmber of strikes is to strengthen the Executives of the Unions by giving them responsibility for decisions.    The supporters of this view allege that the Executives rarely call stoppages arbitrarily;    that the removal of the Executives&apos; present veto would not only increase the number of strikes but would facilitate the official recognition of strikes which now have to remain unofficial,    and that the effect in many.cases of taking the ballot would be to tie the hands of tho Executive and so increase the difficulty of reaching a settlem&amp;nt.70     In view of these and other considerations, the Committee thought it desirable to confer on the question of tho secret ballot with some representative employers, and Lord Weir and Sir Andrew Duncan were good enough to attend and discuss the matter.    Speaking for themselves only, these gentlemen ooncnrxed in the opinion that a secret ballot would be ineffective in remedying any of the essential ovils of the present situation,,    In their view the disadvantages of such machinery outweighed the advantages, and while not ruling out the advisability of secret ballot maohinery as part of a reorganised trade union system,  they deprecated the institution of a compulsory ballot until after exhaustive enquiry.
8.      After careful review,  the Committee by a majority reached the conclusion that the consi-derations indicated abovo are outweighed by the urgent need for a statutory secret ballot and for enacting that stril es which take place without such a ballot shall be unauthorised strikes and shall be deprived of the protection of the Trade Disputes Act.9.      It has been suggested to the Committee that the ballot p-apers should be issued and the votes received by a Public authority,  e.g. by the Chief Registrar of Friendly Societies.    While it may be questionable whether that secrecy which is essential can be obtained in any other way than by means of a - ballot system conducted by the State,the expense and complications inherent in any such a system render its adoption undesirable if this can possibly be avoided *    A State ballot would, for example,  render necessary the creation and rna intainance of a register of the membership of all Trade Unions  (whioh is constantly changing). The State would have to assume responsibility not merely for the conduct of the ballot but for the form of the ballot paper, and would probably be forced sooner or later to bear the greater part, if not the whole, cost of the service,  - an annual charge, which having regard to the number of ballots and the complexity of the administration, could not fail to be very substantial,.
jo,      Having regard to these, anong other, considerations 175 the Committee feel unable to recommend the Cabinet to&quot; adopt a State ballot system; -&quot; nd they suggest the follovring plan, rihoh leaves the ballot arrangements under the management of the Trade Unions subject to the general supervision and control of the Chief Registrar and prescribes certain safeguards viliich, in the opinion of the Committee will go far to secure the secrecy and proper conduct of future Trade Union strike ballots..     It is accordingly proposed that tie Bill should provide:-(a.) That all Trade Unions be registered - a provision which would have the additional advantage of securing that every Union shall in future make an annual financial return to the Chief Registrar.(b) That tie&apos; Chief Registrar shall make regulations prohibiting the Executive or other Authority from declaring a. strike except with the previous approval of a secret ballot of the Union or Branch, affected, in which at least 50 per cent of the Members of the Union or Branch entitled to vote actually vote:    the decision to strike only being carried when the votes recorded in favour of a strike exceed by 20 per cent or more the votes against a strike-.(c) That the rules shall, among other things,  provide that every qualified member of the Union directly affected by the proposed strike shall be entitled to vote aud shall have an equal right, and if reasonably practicable, a fair opportunity, of voting]    that the form of every ballot paper shall be such as to show plainly whether the voter is or is not in favour of striking; that the ballot paper together with an envelope addressed
to the Chief Registrar shall he sent by post to every voter entitled to vote addressed to the voter at his last known place of abode.      That ballot papers shall be completed by the voters arid sent by them by post direct tc the Chief Registrar.      That a return shall be made to the Chief Registrar by the Secretary or other official of the Truuo Union or Branch showing tho number of voters entitled to vote and the number of ballot papers issued to voters.      That the votes shall be counted and the result ascertained and declared by the Chief Registrar or some person nominated by him.(d) That every ballot paper sent by post to or by a voter shall be exempt from postage.(e) That tJbe provisions of the Ballot Act 1872 for securing secrecy and freedom from interference in voting shall apply to ballots under the Act.(f) That persons contravening the regulations shall be guilty of an offence.(g) That any strike which shall not have been approved by a ballot taken in accordance with the rules shall be deemed to be an unaiithorised strike and the Trade Pisputes Act shall not apply to it.JROTICTIOP   11. The Bill should also provide that no person refusingIL&apos;70RKERS -to take part in an illegal or unauthorised strike shall by reason of such refusal be expelled from his union or be subjected to any fine, penalty or disability, and empowering a person aggrieved by a breach of this provision to take proceedings for enforcing his rights.      As workmen who are illegally dee It with, may be reluctant or unable to incur the
risk and expense of litigation, the Committee are of Opinion that power&apos;,should he given to an aggrieved member of a trade union, in lieu of taking legal proceedings, to make a complaint to the Chief Registrar, who shall have power fas under Section 3, Sub-section 2 of the Trade Union Act 1913) to make an order remedying the breach.      Further,  as a trade unionist who has been wrongfully expelled may feel that if he is restored by the Chief Registrar to membership he will be in danger of suffering further injustice from his fellow-members, the Committee think that the Registrar should be authorised, in lieu of making an order for restoration, to order that he be paid but of tho fends of thy Union a sum based on his contributions to the Union funds.
jjfvll 12. The Cbmmittee have been furnished, among othergcrrpnts;nd^pecal documents, with a Memorandum by the Treasury on Trade Unionises Authorityemployees.    in the Civil Service, and also with a Memorandum by thein.Minister of Health on the-&apos; action of certain Local Authorities/ requiring their employees to be members of Trade Unions. Copies    of these memoranda ere annexed to this report (Appendices I and II).      Tho Committee are impressed with the serious danger to tho public interest arising out of the entanglement of Civil Service Associations with outside industrial and political bodies, and with the urgent need Rf prohibiting such connections by legislation which cannot readily be altered on the change of Government.      It is in effect suggested that  (subject to certain specified exceptions) Civil Servants should be forbidden by law from joining Associations other than those the membership of which is confined to tho Civil Service and which have no oonneotion, direct or-indirect, with outside political or other bodies. With regard to Jjpoal Authority employees, the Committee favour the adoption of the third suggestion .in the Minister of Health1 s Memorandum forbidding a Local Authority from making the employment or the continuance of the employment of anyiof its servants conditional upon membership of a Trade Union. The Committee also consider that .* ny person employed by a Local Authority who wilfully breaks his contract of service with thr^tAuthority should be guilty of an offence punishable by a fine or imprisonment.13. While the Committee are agreed that statutory provis-ions of the kind indicated in the previous paragraph are urgently necessary,  they feel some doubt whether these provisions should be in go rpo rated in the pjresent Bill.      There is much to be said for embodying them in separate legislation. This question might be further considered before the intro-       I duct ion of the Bill.      In the meantime the Committee have attached to the Bill draft clauses for giving effect to these recommendations. g
?^KffgLNG. 14.     Ine Committee have given consideration to thequestion of picketing during strikes, upon which the Home Secretary recently submitted a Memorandum (S*T. (24) 15) to the Cabonet;    and the Committee are upon tho whole in agreomont with tho conclusions of that Memorandum.      They do not doubt that the right of 1 peaceful persuasion&apos; reserved to Trade Unions by Section 2 of the Trade Disputes Act,     1906, and to some extent (as the memorandum shows) by previous legislation and judicial decision, is not infreqnontly abused - and especially in the oase of &apos;home picketing&apos; which may easily take the form of intimidation of the wives of dependants of workmen.     hut in fact these abuses are already prohibited by law and receive the attentions of the polioo;    and the Committee doubt whether a proposal that the practico of peaceful persuasion, which is abundantly followed by all tho political parties, shall be rendered criminal in any industrial dispute, would receive the approval of Parliament.      This, however, appears to some meatbsrs of the Committee to deserve     further and more detailed consideration.&apos;i&apos;EB TRADB        15*     It was proposed to the Committee that Section 4 IP^JTESAOQJ. of the Trade iiisputos Act, 1906, which prohibits allactions of tort against Trade Unions, should now be repealed.      The Committee are unanimous in holding that this enactment, which gives to Trade Unions alone an Immunity against the civil consequences
of wrong-doing, cannot in principle &quot;bo defended&quot;; but the opinion has prevailed in the Committee that a proposal now to repeal the section would be construed as an attack upon Trade Unions generally and might only result in the return at the naxt election of a G-ovcrn-mant pledged to, restore it.     The Committee, have therefore not included this proposal in their reoommend-ations;    nor have   thought this a convonlont time in which to doal with the question of the political levy.16*       The Committoe are aware that proposals havo been made for applying to industrial disputes the principle of compulsory arbitration, or for the universal establishment of wages boards;    but they aro of opinion that tho consideration of those far-reaching reforms must be postponed until a later date.17.       The Committee submit to the Cabinet a draft Bill for giving of fact to thair recommendations (Appendix III).     is&apos;or obvious reasons this Bill should be passed into law as quickly as possible, aftsr introduction.     If it is impracticable to introduce the Bill forthwith, and secure its passago into law before the Summer fiacass, tho Committee, while regretting the necessity for the delay, feel that there is no alter-native but to defer its introduction until aft^r tho iioooss.18. The Committee submit tho following recommendations to the Cabinet;-(1)    That general approval should be given to the Conclusions of the Committee oon-tained in this heport.(2)    That approval should be given to the attached draft Trade Union 19 6 Bill.(3)    That in the event of the Cabinet deciding to postpone the introduction of the Bill it should bo considered whether the
provisions relating to tha Civil Service and Local Authority employees should he incorporated in the Bill or should be transferred to a separate Bill.Signed on behalf of the CommitteeCAVE.CHAIRMAN.(Signed)    B- Be HO^ORTH, Secretary-23 Whitufcuall Gardens,  S-vv. 1. 28th June, 1926*
APPENDIX    I,MOST SECRET.TRADE UNIONISE IN THE CIVTL SERVICE.The two outstanding facts In the development oftrade unionism In the Civil Service during the last thirty years have been -(i) the employment by the larger Associations of whole time officials, who are not Civil Servants and the recognition of such officials by the Government:(2) a growing    tendency on the part ofAssociations of Civil Servants towards affiliation with the Trade Union Congress and the Labour Party.Under modern conditions the business of looking afterthe Interests of the larger Civil Service Associations isno doubt a whole time job, and It would be extremelydifficult,  if not impossible, to devise any workable orsatisfactory alternative to the well-established practiceof recognising Association officials who are not themselvesCivil Servants.      In any event, the real danger in thepresent situation is not the employment of otitsiderepresentatives but the entanglement of Civil ServiceAssociations with outside industrial and political bodies.This involves,  inevitably,  a divided allegiance:    and theattitude adopted by certain Civil Service associations duringthe general strike has shewn beyond all question that theallegiance of Civil Servants to an:/ authority but thatof the Government however lightly It may have been permitted in days gone by,  can no longer be tolerated.$ (rr-TTTHDOCUIvfeM1 IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANi-IIC :*JAJ*STYf 5 GOVERNMENT) ,
It is proposed accordingly,    in any legislation that may be introduced f^r the purpose of amending the Trades Disputes Act,  to incorporate clauses to provide(a) that the membership of any (trade union) Association which a Civil Servant is at liberty to join must be confined to Civil Servants:(b) that such Associations must be entirely dissociated from and Independent of outside trade unions and political paroles and associations:(c) that such Associations cf Civil Servants must not apply their funds in furtherance of the candidature of anyone for Parliament:(d) that such Associations of Civil Servants must not employ any officer who is connected in any way with outside trade unions etc.(e) that any Civil Servant    contravening these previsions shall become disqualified for continuing to be a member of the Civil Service,It should be noted that these provisions will not apply to workmen employed In Government industrial establishments.      These men belong to the big industrial and craft unions:    and if only for the reason thatecession from, these Unions would Imperil their chances of securing any employment outside the Government service,   &apos;lt would be impracticable to alter existing practice so far as workmen are concerned.
(l)    It shall not be lawful for a Civil Servant to whom this section applies to become or after the expiration of three months from the passing of this Act to he a member of any organisation having for its object or one ef its objects to influence or affeot the remuneration or conditions of employment of its members except an organisation which fulfils the following conditions:-(a) its membership must be confined te members of the Civil Servioe;(b) it must be independent pf and not associated directly or indirectly with any suoh organisation as aforesaid outside the Civil service       with any political party or association;(c) its members must by its constitution be prohibited from being officers of er otherwise asao elated direotly or Indireetly with any such organisation as aforesaid outside the Civil Service;fd )    it must by its constitution be prohibited from applying any of its funds In furtherance cf the objects sf any such organisation as aforesaid outside the civil  Service or the candidature of any candidate for election to Parliament;(o)    it must by its constitution be prohibitedand its members must be similarly prohibited from accepting financial assistance from any such organisation as aforesaid outside the Civil Service;if)    it must not employ any officer who is amember of,  or receives any remuneration or
other financial assistance from, or is   ; otherwise connected with, any such organisation as aforesaid outside the Civil Service. Provided that nothing in this section(i)    shall prevent a Civil Servant from being amember of a society or corporation whose primary ob^9ct is the maintenance of a standard ef professional efficionoy by means of the grant of diplomas or certificates or otherwise, or- rf any organisation by reason only that it employs an officer who is a member of such a society cr corporation;    and any question as to whether any society or corporation is such a society or corporation as aforesaid shall be determined by the Treasury whose deoision shall be finali(ii)    shall prevent a person who in addition to being a Civil Servant is also engaged in some other employment or occupation from being a member of a trade union or organisation having for its object or one of its objects to influence or affect the remuneration or conditions of employment of persons engaged in that employment or occupation.(2)    Any federation or association of or representativeof trade unions or other organisations each or any of whichhas for its object or one of its objects to influence; oraffect the remuneration or conditions of employment of its members shall for the purposes of this section be deemed.to be an organisation having for one of its objects to influence or affect the remuneration or conditions ofemployment of its members.-4-
If any Civil Servant to whom this section applies knowingly Contravenes any of the provisions of this section he shall be disqualified for continuing to be a member of the Civil Service.(4)    The Civil Servants  to whom this section applies include all persons employed in any civil capacity in the public service of the Crown whose remuneration is payable directly or indirectly out of the Consolidated Fund or moneys provided by Parliament, except -fi)    the holders of political offices, tnat is to say, offices usually held by members of one or other of tho Houses of Parliament: (ii)    workpeople employed in an industrial capacity in any Grown establishment for the consideration of whose remuneration and other conditions of service an industrial joint council for State employees is for the time being established.

TRADE UIIIOUISM IE THE CIVIL SERVICE.Note by the Sec ret a ry trL t h e Treas ur y.Lord Chancellor^.I understand that the Legislation Committee at its last meeting had again under consideration the proposal to provide in the draft Trade Union Bill for the severance of Civil Service association.io.ns from outside political and industrial organisations, and that at the end of the meeting the question was raised whether the recommend at iors under this head which had been submitted to the Committee had been discussed with the Permanent Heads of the principal Departments of State.     The answer to that question was that the three or four Meads of Departments who have been taken into consultation were all in favour of the measure and that no doubt the remainder would be of the same view.      To make sure however, and acting on the suggestion which I understand you yourself made,  I have held a conference of the Permanent Heads of the principal departments.      I put before them the broad details of the scheme that had be-en submitted to the Legislation Committee, and am now authorised by them to lay before you the following statement of their views on the subject (1)    It is the essential duty of every servant of the State that he should at all times without reservation place his services at the disposal of the State. . (2)    The affiliation of Associations of CivilServants to outaide political and industrial organisations involves members of the Civil Service in a divided allegiance incompatible with this essential duty.
(3)    This incompatibility was clearly demonstrated during the general strike.(4)    The opportunity should immediately be taken, whilst the lessons of the general strike are still fresh in the mind, to set the Civil Service free from all such entanglements.(5)    legislation is the best, and indeed,  the only permanently effective instrument for effecting this purpose.(6)    Legislation for this purpose would be welcomed by the best part of the Civil Service.22.6.26.Treasury Chambers.

MEMESRSHIP OP TRAD&apos;3 UNIONS BY WPIiDYKSOP LOCAL AUTHORITIES.Memorandum by the Minister of Health.As long ago as 1920 a question arose, and was the subject of consideration by the Government as to the limits within which a local authority was Justified in expecting its servants to Join a trade union.     The question then took the form of a proposal by certain borough councils and boards of guardians, particularly the Poplar Borough Council and Board of Guardians.(i) that all applications for Increases of salary were to be made through the trade union or association representing the officer oar workman concerned;(ii) that increases of salary by way of war bonus or the merging of war bonus in salary should be conditional upon the officer or workman being a member of a trade union or association, or becoming a member within a specified time.The view then taken was that the first of these proposals was one thut could not be opposed since the Government had endorsed the principle of collective bargaining and the settlement of employment conditions by bodies in the nature of Whitley Councils.     As regards the second point, the Home Affairs Committee (H.A.C.54th Minutes) were agreed that the proposal of the local authority was wrong and ought to be resisted.   At the
same time the Law Officers were consulted on the question whether the Minister of Health could take any effective action, either by- withhold ing -grants in aid or otherwise to prevent wages being paid ay aiff-grential rates to members and non-members of trade unions and also to prevent membership of a union being made a condition of employment.     Their answer was to the effect that there was nothing illegal in the action complained of and that except by giving the Minister full control over the appointment and dismissal and salaries of all employees of local authorities the difficulty could not be satisfactorily dealt with by legislation.     They added that it would be possible to evade any statutory provisions of a less drastic character.The only remedy departmentally suggested at the time was the possibility of withholding grants in aid from local authorities In certain cases on the ground of extravagant expenditure.     Considerable doubt, however, was expressed by the Committee as to the extent of the present powers of the Minister of Health in this direction and the Committee further took the view that it would not be possible to prevent a council from dismissing men who had refused to Join a trade union.The policy initiated by the Poplar Board of Guardians has tended to spread and the attitude taken by the Minister of Health has been, while deprecating that policy, to say that the matter was not one in which he could interfere with the discretion of the employers.
Various compromise arrangements have been made betweeii different local authorities and their employees, particularly In the direction of recognising associations of local government and poor law officers or such a body as the British Medical Association as being bodies so analogous to trade unions that membershop of them satisfies the intention of the employers, and there is probably a substantial number of boards of guardians and councils in which all employees now belong either to trade unions or associations of this kind.   It is not known in how many cases resolutions have now been passed directing the immediate dismissal of employees who do not belong to trade unions, but the Department are not aware of more than half a dozen and it is not known whether in these cases the modification of policy Involved in recognising an officers&apos; association as a trade union has been adopted.Certain proposals have recently, according to Press reports and questions in the House of Commons, been made by local authorities that their employees should in all cases become members of the appropriate Trade Union and should be dismissed if they do not do so.It is possible that the dismissal of an employee by a local authority, merely on the ground that he is not a member of a trade union, might be held to be invalid, though recent legal decisions on the subject of married women teachers indicate that it would be exceedingly difficult to establish a case for interference by the Court.Even, however, if proceedings could be successfully taken, this would prove a very imperfect safeguard in the present difficulty, for past experience of boards of guardians shows them to be quite capable of waiting their time and effecting dismissals or other punishment on some other ground on which their discretion is not open to question, and it
is clearly impossible, as the law stands, to prevent local the strike which will have to be considered when fullauthorities from selecting, when making appointments, persons&apos; &apos; ilwho are already members of a suitable trade union. -;: &apos;. !jOn the other hand, recent events have demonstrated the 1danger of permitting public servants to own a divided loyalty,    ifIThere are indications that the associations of local government or poor law officers may no longer be accepted by certain local authorities as the equivalent of trade unions and il in other ways some authorities seem to be determined that the services they administer shall be subject to paralysis at the1will of a trade union executive.   The courses open, if it -should be decided to take aotion to prevent any spread of the practice under discussion, appear to be -1.     Legislation prohibiting the servant of a local authority from undertaking any liability by membership of a trade union or otherwise to leave his employment except on due determination of his contract, and attaching special penalties enforceable by the Public Prosecutor or some other independent authority to any such leaving of his employment.2.     The mobilization of local authority opinion against the practice by a submission of the matter to the Joint Industrial Councils for municipal services.3.     Legislation prohibiting a local authority from having any regard to membership or non-membership of a trade union on the part of their servants or of candidates for employment (such a servant at all events would then be able to resort to the     I Courts in the event of dismissal).The effectiveness of the first expedient depends onjthe extent to which the authority empowered to enforce the penalties uses its powers.    It would seem further that aibill dealing only with such a solution of the difficulty might be exposed to severe criticism in the House and that it should preferably form part of a wider remedial scheme baBed on experience of the action of local authorities during
information ia available.    It would seem alBO necessary to apply the proposal to the Civil Service as a whole, as well as to the local service.The second proposal is understood to be favoured by the Minister of Labour.    In itself it is open to criticism on the ground that it might result in a variety of conclusions arrived at by different Industrial Councils and thus provide no stable foundation for legislation or even for public opinion.The third expedient may well tend to prevent a spread of the problem and even to eliminate it in districts in which the opinion of the local authority is not unanimous.    It is a question how far it would be effective in the districts where the problem is at present most urgent, and action really taken on the ground of non-membership of a trade union can readily be covered by various administrative pretexts.    At the same time the fact that the practice was laid down as illegal in a statute would help to focus resistance to proposals for Its adoption and to build up a sound public opinion.The practicability of penalizing strikers in the service of local authorities by loss of accrued superannuation rights has been considered, but it seems unlikely that a penalty of this kind would in fact be enforced or would be seriously regarded.N.C.11th June, 1926.
