to the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs,Dated 30th June 1926. (Heceived Dominions Office 12,15 a,m, 1st July 1926)Priority,   Secret,As I have already informed you Mr, Mackenzie King asked me grant him &amp; dissolution and I refused.   Thereupon he resigned and I asked Mr, Meighen to form a Government which he has done.   This constitutional or unconstitutional act of mine seem a to resolve itself into these salient features,   A Governor General has the absolute right of granting or of refusing a dissolution,   A decision to refuse is a very dangerous one as it embodies the rejection of the advice of accredited Minister which is the bedrock of constitutional government.     Therefore,  in nine cases out of ten a Governor General should take the -advi-ce of the Prime Minister on this as on other matters.   But if the Governor General considers the advice offered to be wrong and unfair and not for the welfare of the people it behoves him to act in what he considers the best interests of the country.This ie naturally the point of view I have taken and which I expressed in my reply to Mr, King,   Text of reply is being telogr&amp;phed separately.It will be observed that the letter in question is an acknowledgment of a letter from Mr, King (the text of which is also being telegraphed) appealing to me to consult the Imperial Government.   &quot;While recognising to the full the help that this course might afford me, I flatly refused telling Mr. King that to ask advice from London, where Canadian conditions were not as well known as they were to rae, was to put the British Government in the unfortunate
position of having to offer a solution which might give the Canadian people that feeling of participation in their politics which is to &quot;be strongly deprecated,,It seems to me that there was one person and one alone who was responsible for decision and that person was myself.   If the Imperial Government were involved I should feel that the relationship of the Dominion to the old country would be liable to be seriously&apos; jeopardized whereas any incompetent and unwise action of a Governor General can only involve &quot;imself.I am glad to say that I was able to maintain a friendly feeling with my late Prime- Minister to the end0    I should have offered my resignation at once had it been otherwise,,&apos;   This point of view has been uppermost in my mind ever since Mr. King determined (against my private advice) on retaining office last November.    It has not been always easy but it was imperative; a Governor General and a Prime Minister could not allow a difference of point of view to wreck their relationship without the greatest detriment to the country.   Mr. King whose bitterness was veiy marked (? on Monday) will probably take a very vitriolic line against myself,  that seems only natural. I have to await the verdict of history to prove that the course I adopted was a wrong one and this I do with an easy conscience convinced that whether right or wrong I have acted in the interests of Canada and have implicated no one else in my decision.There is only one thing I have to add and that is that at our last three interviews I appealed to Mr. King not to put the Governor General in the position of having to make a controversial decision.   Mr. King refused and I did not see what else I could do.
Secret.      My telegram of 30th June following is text of my reply of June 29th to Mr., Mackenzie King begins.      My dear Mr. King,  I must acknowledge on paper with many thanks the receipt of your letter handed to rne at our meeting yesterday.In trying to condense all that has passed between us during the last week it seems to my mind that there is only one point at issue.You advise me &quot;that as,  in your opinion^ Mr. Meighen is unable to govern the country there should be another election with the present machinery to enable the people to decide&apos;M.      My contention is that Mr, Meighen has not been given a chance of trying to govern or saying he cannot do so and that all reasonable expedients should be tried before resorting to another election.Permit me to say once more that before deciding on my constitutional course on this matter 1 gave the subject the most fair minded and painstaking consideration which it was in my power to apply.I can only add how sincerely I regret the severance of our official companionship and how gratefully I acknowledge the help of your counsel and co-operation.Wi th warme st wishe s,Yours etc.,Letter ends.Paraphrase telegram from the Governor General of Canada to the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.(Dates 30th June,  1926) (Received Dominions Office 6,20 a.nu  1st July,  1926).
Secret.     My telegram of 30th June following is text of Mr. Mackenzie King&apos;s letter to me of 28th June Begins.. My dear Governor General Your Excellency having declined to accept my advice to place your signature to the Order in Council with reference to the dissolution of Parliament which I have placed before you today I hereby tender to Your Excellency my resignation as Prime Minister of Canada.Your Excellency will recall that in our recent conversations relative to dissolution I have on each occasion suggested to Your Excellency as I have again urged this morning that having regard to the possible very serious consequences of a refusal of the advice of your first Minis ter to dissolve Parliament you should, before definitely deciding on this step,  cable the Secretary of State for the Dominions asking the British Government,  from whom you have come to Canada under instructions,  what in the opinion of the Secretary of State for the Dominions your course should be in the event of the Prime Minister presenting you with an Order in Council having reference to a dissolution,,As a refusal by a Governor General to accept advice of a Prime Minister is a serious step at any time and mostserious under existing conditions in all parts of the British?      ?Empire to-day there will be raised I fear by the refusal on Your Excellency&apos;s part to accept advice tendered a grave constitutional question without precedent in the history of Creat Britain for a century and in the history of Canada since in.PARAPHRASE TB LEG HAH.From the Governor General of Canada to the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.Dated 30th June, 1926.

1st July.      Personal  and Secret-      Your Secret telegram of 30th June.    I have read with the  greatest interest your telegram and your correspondence with Mr. Mackenzie JLIng.      I am exceedingly sorry that it should have fallen to your lot to have to deal with so delicate and difficult a situation.      I cannot of course express any opinion on your action hut I can state that I unreservedly concur in the view which you took of the suggestion that you should  refer, to me before deciding on the request for a dissolution.      Clearly the matter is one concerning Canadian internal affairs in which Ministers here could not take it. upon themselves to intervene.    I may say that had you referred to me I could only have replied on similar lines to the statements with  regard to the political situation in Hew South Wales which I made in tho House of Commons on 25th March -viz, that in my view it would not be proper for the Secretary of State to issue Instructions with regard to the exercise of his  constitutional duties to a Governor-AMERY.PARAPHRASE TELEGRAM Prom the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs to tho Governor General of Canada.

CANADA.Cove rnment House , OTTAWA, 18th  January,  192 6.Sir,,I heve the honour to enclose, herewith, a Memorandum by my Secretary, setting forth what took place between myself and my Prime Minister immediately after the General Election which was held on the 29th of October last.I have the honour to be, Sir,Your most obedient,humb1e s e rv ant,&apos; BYEG 01 VIMY.jutenant ColonelThe Right Ron our able MC-.M.S.

She General election took place1 on the 29th October and the result was as followsConservatives li7Liberals 100Progressives 28Labour 2Independent 1Doubtful 184 6The Prime Minister had several interviews with the Governor General between the 30th Ootober and the 4th November.At these interviews the situation was thoroughly discuasad In all its bearings.     The result of the first interview was that the Prime Minister went away saying he would resign - though he had not oome up to Government House to hand in his resignation - but had accepted the private and confidential view expressed by the Governor General that that was his proper course.The next day he came up again to see His Excellency and announced that he had changed his mind and now thought It was his duty and his right to stay on as Prime Minister and meet the house of Commons.Ms  xcelloncy again tried to persuade him&apos; to take the dignified course of resigning - as ,. as his Excellency pointed out, the Prime Minister had lost IV seats, while the Loader of the Opposition had gained 67, but told him that there was no constitutional reason against his continuing in Office.Several more interviews took place but tho Prime Minister did not again change his mind.- The only course then open to tho Governor General was
(l)    To insist on tha Prime Minister calling the houso of commons to meet at the earliest possible moment.(2)    To make the Prime Minister understand that no politioal appointments (Senators, Judges, etc.,) could be made in the interim - and that no contracts should be made for any navy public works.His Excellency also gave the -trims Minister to underatand that he would not grant him another dissolution.Tha point of view that His i&amp;icollency endeavoured to keep uppermost   -in his mind was to maintain a feeling of friendship and confidence botwean Prime Minister and Governor General, although they were absolutely opposed in opinions. There were moments when this was a matter of difficulty. The maintenance of this confidence seemed   absolutely essential at a tima when feeling throughout the Dominion was runninghigh. . ,. &apos;It only remains to be said that when first the: announcement was made that the- Prime Minister would not resign but would meet the Hbuse of Commons, there was a tendency on the part of the Conservatives in general (it must be remembered that political feelings ware red-hot at the time) to criticise the Governor General&apos;s docision.      This quickly disappeared, and it Is. now universally admittod that the Governor General did tha right thing.On tho evening of the 4th November tho Prime Ministerissued the following statement to the press      -.,&quot;The latest official returns having made it apparent that as a result of tho general election held on October 29th no one of the participating political parties would of itsolf havo a clear majority in the House of Commons when Parliament assembled,  it became my duty as Prime Minister to acquaint His iitecollency the Governor-General with the situation and to advise His Excellency as to the course which should be pursued.     -after several interviews with . His i/Xcelloncy at which tho position brought out by tho recent general election was fully discussed and all alternatives presented, I have taken the responsibility of advising Mia Excelloncy to summon Parliament for the
earliest practicable date in order to ascertain the attitude of the Parliamentary representatives towards the very important question raised by the numerical position of the respective political parties *   His Excellency has been pleased to accept this advice.&quot;After careful consideration of the constitutional precedents and their bearing upon the situation which has arisen ss a result of the general election,  the Cabinet decided unanimously this afternoon that it was their constitutional duty to meet Parliament at the earliest possible moment, regard being had for the legal require-ments with respect to the time necessary for tha return of the writs and the official gazetting of the members who have been elected.&quot;In the interval until Parliament assembles it is the intention of the Government to refrain from making appoint-ments beyond such as are essential for the proper carrying on of the public business.&quot;In the present situation, there are three possible courses of procedure,  each of which has been carefully considered by the Cabinet:fl)    That His Excellency be asked to grant an immediate dissolution of Parliament;(2) That His Excellency be asked to call upon the Leader of the largest political group to form a Government;(3)    That His Excellency be asked to summonParliament at the earliest practicable date for the purpose afore-mentioned.&quot;With respect to an immediate dissolution, it was felt that it was not in the interests of the country to occasion the turmoil and expense of another general election until at least Parliament had been summoned and the people1s representatives in. Parliament had been afforded an oppor-tunity of giving expression to their views.&quot;With respect to the leader of the political party having the largest definite following in the House of Commons being called upon to form an admihistration, the Cabinet holds the view that responsible self-government in Canada rests upon the prinoiple that the majority are entitled to govern,  the majority so understood meaning not the political party or group having the largest number of members, but the majority as determined by the duly elected representatives of the people in Parliament.    Ear from indicating that Mr. Meighen is in a position to command a majority in the newly elected House of Commons the results of the elections appear clearly to indicate that he is not in such a position.    I am not aware of any precedent in Great Britain or in Canada for recommending&apos;, before
Parliament meets, that the leader.of a party not commanding a clear majority in the House of Commons should he called upon to form a Government.&quot;To summon Parliament and to allow the House of Commons to disclose its attitude upon division is the procedure warranted by constitutional precedent and by the present circumstances-    To tafce any other oourse would be to fail to recognize the supreme right of the people to govern themselves in the manner which the constitution has provided, namely,  expressing their will through their d\ily olocted representatives in Parliament and in accordance with recognized parliamentary practice.&quot;AJ1.
