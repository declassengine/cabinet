The District Coalownors&apos;  Associations in the different coalfields have considered the proposals submitted by the Government on the termination of the General Strike for dealing with the stecdlock in which its negotiations with the Miners1 Federation,  and with the Trades Union Council, ended on the 2nd May.Before giving their views on the proposals the owners feel it       necessary to review briefly the circumstances which have    led up to the present impasse.The stoppage of work in the mines on the 1st May was not the result of an ordinary industrial dispute but was the direct consequence of an economic situation brought about to a very large extent by political interference with the industry.The mest important of the burdens which this political interference has placed on the industry in recent years are:-(1) The reduction of the legal hours of workunderground by one hour under the Seven Hours Act of 1919,(2) The raising of the minimum level of wages whichthe owners were compelled under political pressure to concede in April 1924 and which was superlm-posed on a levels fixed in 1921 which itself had become uneconomic by reason of the general fall in prices sinoe that time. The Royal Commission on the Coal Industry themselves draw attention to the error which was made in 1924.    The
combined effect of the shortening of hours and of the uneconomic minimum wage level is that - to use the words in which the Royal Commission describe the condition of things - &quot;disaster is impending over the industry&quot;.Faced with this position, the owners were obliged at the end of June 1925 to give notice of the termination of the 1924 Mages Agreement,  and at the end of July the Government,  in order to avoid a stoppage,  decided to&apos; maintain the wages position under that agreement for nine months by moans of a subsidy, ponding the investigation of the economic position of the industry by a Royal Commission.The Commission reported on the    11th March last.    Th found that an immediate reduction of wages was necessary *     They also remarked that the situation might bo such that the worlcmon would prefer to agree to an extension of working hours so as to lessen the amount of the reduction in wages, though the; Commission themselves did not favour this course.       They reported favourably on the efficiency of the individual coal mining undertakings generally,  though they made certain suggestions relating to the organisation of the industry which,  in their view, would improve its economic position.      The principal of these were the formation of coal selling combines and the amalgamation of the  smaller     undertakings into larger imits.The Commission further suggested that before either party should be required to make any sacrifices there
should he an undertaking on both sides that  ill practicable measures for improving the organisation of the industry and for increasing its efficiency should be adopted as quickly as the circumstances in ea-.di case permitted.The Government intimated that though they were opposed in principle to certain of the recommendations of the Commission they would accept the whole Report and take the necessary legislative or administrative action if both of the other parties,  i.e. the owners and workmen, did the same and a peaceful settlement could thereby be arrived at.The owners also,  while of opinion that certain of the conclusions of the Commission were based on false premises and would be detrimental rather than beneficial to the industry,  indicated the action which they would be prepared to take with a view to giving effect so far as possible to the objects aimed at in the recommendations calling for action on their part if a settlement could thereby be reached without a stoppage of work.They further urged that the Miners&apos; federation should consider the question of an extension of hours of work in order to lessen the amount of the necessary reduction in wage s.The negotiations broke down because the Miners&apos; Federation made it quite clear that notwithstanding the recommendations of the Royal Commission they would in no circumstances be prepared to consider any reduction of
wages at all,      They refused also to consider any exten-sion of hours or even the suggestions of the Royal Commission with a view to securing   greater flexibility, $[either the intervention of the Government nor the pressure of the Trades Union Congress was successful in moving the Miners&apos; Federation from this position.As the miners&apos; organisations declined to discuss the terms which the owners could afford to offer as from the 1st May when the wages subvention ceased,  the owners had no alternative but to prepare and publish their own offers. In framing these offers,  as was pointed out at the time, all the districts in which material    reductions of wages were necessary gave the whole of the net proceeds from the sale of coal to wages and reserved no profit.2ven this sacrifice of profits did not represent the full lengths to which the owners ultimately went. In making a final effort to secure a peaceful settlement, they subsequently at the instance of the Government formu-lated an offer of a uniform national minimum on the basis of an eight hours working day which necessitated still further sacrifices on the part of certain of the districts which as previously stated had already applied the whole of the net proceeds to wages. The terms of this offerwere adjusted with the Government on the 30th April and communicated by the Government to the Miners&apos;    Federation. The Miners&quot; Federation refused to modify their attitude in the slightest degree and the stoppage of work at the mines took place on the 1st May.
THE GOVERNMENT PROPOSALS OF THE I4TH MAY.It will be seen from the foregoing that the deadlock did not arise from any defect in the machinery of negotiation-   in the coal industry.        The owners may also fairly claim that it was not due to any unreasonable attitude of mind on their part, since, as has been said, neither the Government nor the Trades Union Congress succeeded where they themselves had failed.Neither can it be said that the  situation was brought about through questions arising on the recommendations of the Royal Commission, having regard to the declarations which the Government and the owners had made as to the action which they were then prepared to take if a settle-men t without a stoppage of work might thereby be secured.It is necessary to bear these points in mind, when considering the bearing of the Government&apos; s proposals on the present situation.      The proposals will be found on examination to fall into two categories, viz:-(1) Alterations of the machinery for the regulation ox wages and allied questions.(2) k re-statement of the Government&apos;s intentions in.regard to the recommendations of the Royal Commission.Before proceeding therefore to deal with the proposals themselves the owners would point out that the matters to which they relate are not those which are responsible for the deadlock.The plain fact which must be frankly faced is that
i :: - 6 -  :the true reason for the deadlock: is the insistence of the Miners&apos; Federation on the view that the level of wages    in operation up to the 30th April last must be maintained and that the nation must continue to subsidise wages in the coal mining industry^It is now proposed to leal with the proposals themselves and a word is necessary in the first place with regard to the form in which they are framed,While the prominence which is given to the  so-called &quot;re-organisation&quot; proposals is doubtless due to the anxiety of the Government to make  clear their intentions in regard to the recommendations of the Royal Commission calling for legislative or administrative action on their part,  the affect must inevitably be to tend to give support to  the utterly erroneous impression that the coal industry in general is badly organised and that there is room throughout the industry for improvements in organisation which would result in large savings.Let it be said at once that the coal owners do not suggest that the coal industry has attained a state of perfection beyond which no progress is possible.      It must on the other hand be said with equal emphasis that the British coal industry taken as a whole compares favourably in point of efficiency with that of any othor country; that the immediate savings which can be effected by improvements in organisation or in practice apply only to a small fraction of the  industry,  affect items of cost which form only a minute proportion of the total cost of production,  and are insignificant in relation to the whole problem;      Given freedom from political interference,
the goal.industry will continue to progress in the future as in the past and to provide an ever improving standard of life for those employed in it,  but this can only spring from the spirit of progress which is innate in the industry itselfcNothing is clearer than that to interfere with the organisation of the industry ny means of legislation would simply defeat the end in view;  for political interference creates that feeling of uncertainty which tends to sterilise the process of development through voluntary ef f o rtIt is indeed time to state plainly that a rmmber of the conclusions in the Report of the Commission, founded as they are on tho false theory that prosperity can be attained through restriction of the output of coal and enhancement of prices, would spell ruin to British industry. Re-organisation proposa3.s which Involve selling coal at high prices to home industries and disposing of it at low prices to their competitors abroad,  or alternatively relinquishing a large portion of our vital coal export trade, carry their own condemnation.The owners must accordingly urge that a truer sense of perspective be observed in these matters,  and in particular that it be realised that the theory that industry can be coerced into prosperity by restrictive action from outside is unsound and is foreign to all the traditions of free and open competition on which the success of British Industry has been built up under private enterprise in the past.
So far as those parts of the proposals which deal with the machinery of negotiation in the coal industry are con-cerned the owners desire to repeat that these are not germane to the real problem and that no tinkering with this machinery could provide a remedy.Similar criticisms to those directed, against the pro-rosals for legislative interference with the organisation of the industry apply to the element of coercion which it is sought to import into the machinery of negotiation.lilxporienee confirms the view of the owners that the result would, be to increase instead of allaying friction, and to ho.mper&apos;th3 process of negotiation.To sum up,  the position of the owners may be stated as follows:-(l)   The coal industry like other industries subject to world conditions is governed by economic necessities from which there is no escape.      To attempt to ignore them can only result in still further increasing unemployment, not only in the coal industry but throughout the country generally, and adding to the burden of losses which the coal industry is bearing.(2)  There is only one way in which the drastic reduction in the cost of production of coal which the situation demands can be secured without involving hardships for certain of the workmen, particularly in the large exporting districts, and that is by the restoration of the eight hour day.        The reductions in wage rates which would then suffice to bridge the remaining gap
would not exceed about 10 per cent, when wages are at the minimum in the worst placed die tri ct, and even this sacrifice would be more apparent than real,  since it would result in fuller employment and higher actual earnings.(3)  The industry requires freedom and stability in its operations as conditions essential to its prosperity, and the initiating of policies, either legislative or administrative such as are contemplated in certain of the recommendations of the Royal Commission, must inevitably have the effect of restricting its opera-tions and increasing the difficulty of a restoration to sound economic conditions based upon the interests of the community.(4)  The coalowners are convinced that the proposals submitted to them on the 14th May calculated as they are to limit freedom of administration will not be helpful in securing the ultimate result that is aimed at, namely the increased efficiency of the industry. Indeed it must be stated emphatically that it will be impossible to continue the conduct of the industry under private enterprise unless it is accorded the same freedom from political interference as is enjoyed by other industries.In conclusion the owners desire to make it clear that they are fully alive to the importance both to the industry and to the country of pressing forward every development both in organisation and in technique that will assist in securing the maximum degree of efficiency.
Before the war the coal industry could show a record of rapid and continuous development and it provided for those employed in it a high and ever improving standard of life.       As and when the necessity for modifications in the structure of the industry or in the technique of pro-duction and preparation of coal appeared the industry always rose to the occasion.       The whole of the improve-ments that have been effected in mining practice are indeed due to the spontaneous efforts of those responsible for the conduct of the industry.What is necessary in order that progress may continue unhampered is a period of freedom from industrial unrest and political interference which will restore confidence and provide more opportunity for giving serious consideration to the real problems of the industry.Given such conditions the owners can guarantee that throughout the industry there will be a conscious and systematic effort directed to its development and they are confident that in t.iis way the progressive improvement in the standard of living of those employed in the coal industry which was effected right up to the outbreak of the war will be continued in the future.Mining Association of Great Britain.  1st May,  1926.
