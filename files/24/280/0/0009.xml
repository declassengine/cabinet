Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.    THE present constitution of Ceylon established by the Orders-in-Councilof 1931, is based on the recommendations of  the Special Commission of 1928.  Itwas modelled, so far as  some of its main provisions are concerned, on  that ofthe London County Council.  The provisions of the Constitution are summarizedin Appendix I.    2.  Experience of the working of the constitution has shown that, although in some respects it has been a success, in  others it has not realised the expecta-tions  of the Special  Commission.  The constitution in fact suffers from certainserious defects which do  not appear in the London County Council, whe&apos;re theparty system which scarcely exists in  Ceylon-enables the machine to work effectively. This has been particularly noticeable in connection with the  methodof selection of Ministers, the system of Executive Committees and the relationsbetween Ministers, Officers  of State, the  Executive Committees, and  the state council.    3.  The main criticisms of  the existing constitution can be summarized as a follows :     (a)  The method of appointment of Ministers. At present the State  Council          divides itself  by secret ballot into seven Executive Committees, each          of  which  elects its own. Chairman, who is styled Minister.  Ministers          together compose a Board of Ministers and elect one of their  number          to  be Leader  of  the  State Council.    There is ho assurance that          Ministers will be in agreement on major questions of policy;  in fact          it is of frequent occurrence for Ministers to speak and vote on opposite          sides of a  question.   The Leader has no particular authority over          his colleagues.    (b)  The Executive Committees. Each Committee has administrative control          OVER specified  departments of government.  There is no co-ordination          between Committees.  In each Committee proposals involving expendi-          ture  are  advanced without  consideratipri of the general financial          position.  This leads to extravagance and inefficiency.  Questions of          minor importance,&apos; which might  well be settled by the Minister, are          debated at  length. Decisions are taken by majority of votes, and a          4 Minister &quot;may  be required to  defend in the State Council proposals          of  which he does not approve.  Members of  the numerical minority          in  a Committee frequently oppose in the State&apos;Cpuncil the proposals          of  the  Committee. &quot; Neither the Board of INImisters&apos; nor the State          Council has any  power to compel &quot;a  Committee tocarry  out a policy          tp which  the majority of its members are opppsed.  While the Com-          mittees were intended to give opportunity tp members of the minority          religipus or sectarian communities to influence  policy,  they have failed          in that purpose.      [18190]                                                      BSECRET.CP. 254 (38).
     (c) The Officers of State. These three officials (Chief Secretary, Financial           Secretary and Legal  Secretary),  who are members of our Colonial           Service, have administrative control over certain of the most important           departments.   They sit  in  the Board of Ministers  and the State           Council and can speak, but have no votes  in  either  body.   Their           presence is a constant source of irritation to-the State Council,  and           this situation is  aggravated by  the fact that the Officers of State can           and sometimes do oppose in State Council proposals defended by one           or  other of their Ministerial colleagues.     (d) The Control of the Public Service. The appointment,  promotion,  and           disciplinary control of public officers is, under the  Order-in-Council,           vested in the Governor, who acts in such matters on the advice of the           Public Service Commission, a body composed at present of the three           Officers of State.  Nevertheless, under a practice based on the recom-           mendations of the Special Commission, questions of appointment are           discussed at much length in the  Executive Committees, much of whose           time is given up to such  matters.   This gives rise to canvassing in           favour of individual candidates, and to allegations of favouritism  and           injustice.     4.  The major defect, therefore,  has been in the executive sphere, owing tothe lack of corporate responsibility in the  Board of Ministers.  The Board has hadno power either to compose for itself  or to  enforce on the individual Committeesand the State  Council a consistent, co-ordinated  policy.  This has necessarily ledto extravagance and inefficiency, whilst the procedure of the Committees has often been marked by delay and indecision.     5.  During the first session of the State Council, in April 1933, the Board ofMinisters submitted to the Governor  a memorandum suggesting, inter alia,  the strengthening  of the position  of  the  Board of Ministers (excluding the Officersof State) and an alteration in the  method of selection of Ministers.  In the second session of the Council, in April 1937, Ministers submitted a second memorandum,on similar lines. In both cases Ministers&apos; suggestions included a demand for some relaxation  of  the Governors powers. Under these powers  the  Governor may,notwithstanding the opposition of the State Council, enact any legislation whichhe considers necessary &quot; in  the interests of public order, public faith, or otheressentials of good Government.&quot;   The Governor has also the usual powers of veto.It has been made clear by successive Secretaries of State that this demand  cannotat present be entertained.     6.  Successive Secretaries of State have been impressed by the arguments infavour of some improvement in the position of Ministers in relation to the state council.  At the same time they have  recognised  that there was no general agree-ment in Ceylon as to the nature of the  amendments to be made in the Constitution.While the Sinhalese majority favoured the abolition of the Executive Committeesand the election by the full Council of a Chief Minister who should nominate hiscolleagues for  appointment by the Governor, the minority communities were  not willing to abandon the existing system of election by Executive Committees, at  anyrate in the absence.of some further  provision for the representation and safe-guarding of the minorities.     7.  It was clear that changes in the Constitution  which  did  not secure some general  measure of acceptance would not be likely  to  be more success-ful than the existing system.  Sir Andrew Caldecott was, therefore, on appoint-ment as Governor charged with the definite mission of acquainting himself withthe views of all sections  of opinion  in  Ceylon,  with a view to submitting his recommendations for the amendment of the  Constitution.   It was made clear to him that the Secretary of State did not consider the time ripe for any relaxation of the special powers given to the Governor by the existing Orders-in-Council, butin other respects he was given no lead.     8.  He has now submitted an outline of his recommendations in a despatch,a copy of which is attached to  this  memorandum (Appendix II).  In general it may be said that they follow the lines on which we had already been working
in the Colonial  Office.  I am greatly indebted to Sir -Andrew Caldecott for the care,  the patience  and the ability with which  he has devoted  himself  to thetask of reconciling many divergent interests. ..    9.  The Governoi^s^proposals can be summarised as follows :    &apos;    (a) No reduction of the Governors powers.    (b) No material variation in the franchise,  which  is  already in  effect           universal. (Any change would necessarily be regarded as reactionary.)    (c) No deliberate return to a system of communal  representation.    (d) An increase in the number of seats in the State Council,  and redistribution-           tion after enquiry by a local  Commission, with a view to giving greater           opportunity   for  the  return  of representatives  of  the minority           communities.    (e) The imposition of a disability  on members whose  allowances are under           seizure by a Court.    (/) Abolition of the Executive Committees.    (g) Withdrawal of the Officers of  State from  the Board of Ministers and           the State Council.    (h) Selection by the  Governor of  the Leader of the Council, who  should then           choose his Ministers in consultation with the Governor.    (i) The Governor not deliberately   to insist on the inclusion of Ministers           representing  minority  communities; but  the inclusion in the Royal           Instructions of a provision similar to  that in the Indian Instructions,           which suggests the inclusion,  &quot;so far as  practicable,&quot; of members           of important minority communities.    (k) Reduction  of members&apos; allowances, in view of their  relief from service           on Executive Committees.    (I) Appointment of Deputies to Ministers.    (m) The allocation to Ministers of the administrative  duties of  the  Officers           of State, except  in  regard to certain  special subjects over which the           Governor would retain personal control. The addition of two Ministers           to the Board is contemplated; one to relieve the Leader of administrative           work and one, as  Finance Minister,  to  take over the duties of the           Financial Secretary.    (n) The Financial  Secretary  to be  given  a  special  position  with  dual           functions as an Executive Officer under the  Finance Minister, and as           Financial Adviser to the Cabinet and the Governor.    (o) Selection of the Chief Secretary from outside the Island; his  duties to be           to preside over the Public Service Commission, to be Principal           Secretary to the Governor, and to administer the government in the           Governors absence.    (p) A re-constituted Public Service Commission, to remain as at present the           Governors adviser  on service questions.    (q) Variation  of  the special  pension  regulations to limit  the right of           premature retirement given  by the Order-in-Council  of 193&apos;1.   (This           will remove a  minor grievance  of the Council.)    (r) The financial control  of the  Council over salaries  to remain unaltered;           subject to the existing powers  of the Governor  and the Secretary of           State.    10.  The opportunities which I  have had of  learning the views of repre-sentatives  of many sections  of opinion in Ceylon  lead me to believe that  the governors proposals will be widely  supported;  although I recognise that  theymay be attacked, not only by those who press for the immediate grant of full self -government, but also by some members  of the  minority communities who wishto be  placed in a position to prevent the Sinhalese majority from carrying intoeffect any measure to which the minorities are opposed.  While I sympathise withthe desire  of the minorities to secure  additional representation and increasedopportunities for obtaining Ministerial  office, I should not feel justified in goingfurther than the Governor proposes, namely, that there should be a  re-delimitationof electoral areas  with  a  view  to  securing that members of  the minority communities should have  greater opportunities for  securing election to the state council.       [18190]                                                     B  2
    11.  I find myself,  therefore, in general agreement with  the  Governor&apos;sproposals; and although I do not necessarily, at this stage, endorse all the detailsof his scheme for the amendment of the constitution, I consider his proposals well-adapted to form $ie basis for further discussion.               *                                CONCLUSION.  - 12.  Subject to the concurrence of my colleagues, I propose now to authorisethe Governor to publish his proposals, and to arrange that they shall be debated in the State Council.   On the result of that debate will depend the nature of ourfurther action.  If it should show, as I hope it will, a general opinion in favourof the principles of  the Governors recommendations, I  should proceed withoutfurther delay to the drafting of the necessary amending Order-in-Council; and inthis task I should hope to avail myself of the experience of the India Office in theworking  of the Indian constitution.   If,  on  the  other hand;  the  Governor&apos;sproposals should be inadequately supported, or should be received with irreconcilable-cilable hostility by any important sections  of the population, I should have toconsider  whether any  amendment of the constitution could be effected withouta further full  enquiry by  a Parliamentary Commission. ,.    13.  I would add that I  have discussed  this  suggested  procedure withMr. Attlee and Sir Archibald Sinclair, both  of whom agree that this is preferable to the appointment now of another Parliamentary Commission.                                                                 &apos;   M.

APPENDIX I.                         T&amp;e Constitution of Ceylon.                   *     THE present Constitution of Ceylon was brought into operation in July 1931.It  followed upon  an  inquiry by&quot; a  Special  Commission  presided  over  byLord Donoughmore, which visited the Island in 1927 and reported in 1928.  Therecommendations of this Commission were accepted in substance by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment and  by the then existing  Ceylon  Legislative Council.  Under theprevious Constitution established in 1920  and amended in 1923, the Governmenthad been of the pattern existing in most Colonies, i.e.,  a  Governor, ExecutiveCouncil  and Legislative Council, with, however,  an unofficial majority,  and alarge proportion of elected members in the Legislative Council.     2.  Under the present Constitution the Island  is administered through thefollowing organs :      (1) The Governor appointed by His Majesty.     (2) The State Council consisting of 50 elected members, 8 members nominated           by the Governor  (subject  to  His Majesty&apos;s  instructions),  and the           Officers of  State  referred to  below;  the Council is  divided into           7 Executive Committees, whose functions are described later.     (3) The Board  of Ministers, consisting of the 7 chairmen of the Executive           Committees, each elected by his Committee, and the Officers of State.     (4) The Officers of State, i.e., the Chief Secretary, Financial Secretary, and           Legal&apos;Secretary, who are permanent officials appointed by the Governor          - with the approval  of the Secretary of State, and are ex officio members           of the  State Council and Board of Ministers, with the right  to speak           but not to vote.     3.  The elected  members of  the  State  Council are elected on a very widefranchise,  including practically all permanent residents, male and female, overthe age of 21. In  the appointment of the nominated members it was the intention,and has been the  practice,  to have regard to the desirability of  securing repre-sentation of sections of the community which appear to be  inadequately repre-sented among the  elected members.     4.  The ordinary power of legislation is vested in the State Council subjectto the power of the  Governor to refuse assent to any Bill or to reserve it for the signification of His Majesty&apos;s pleasure.   Any  Ordinance,  after assent by theGovernor, may be disallowed by His Majesty.  The Governor  has also power togive effect to any measure, notwithstanding the refusal of the State Council topass  it, on his  declaring that  it is necessary in  the  interests of  public order,public faith, or other essentials of good government, or is essential to give effectto the provisions of the Ceylon  (State Council) Order in Council.  This power isgiven by Article 22 of the Order in Council, as amended by  an Order in Councilof 1937.    5.  The executive administration  of  the Island is, with certain exceptions,carried out under  the control of the State  Council, which has executive as well aslegislative functions.  Its  executive powers are  exercised  mainly  through its7  Executive Committees for  Home  Affairs; Agriculture  and  Lands; local administration; Health; Labour, Industry and Commerce; Education; and Com-munications  and &quot;Works.  The various Government departments are divided into10 groups; 3 of these are in the charge of the Officers of State, and the remaining7 are under the control of the  appropriate  Executive Committees.  The Chairmenelected by the Executive Committees are Ministers for  their respective subjects.The Ministers and Executive Committees are concerned with the control of policyand important details of administration in the departments under them, subjectto the overriding  authority of the State Council as a whole and to the consentof the Governor.   The  latter normally acts on  the advice  of the  appropriate minister or Executive Committee, but  his powers  of independent action already mentioned extend to executive  as  well as  legislative actions, and additional provision is made for his assuming control of the administration in the  event ofan emergency requiring such action.CEYLON (state council) ORDERIN COUNCIL,ARTICLE 7.DITTO,ARTICLE 50.DITTO,ARTICLE 6.CEYLON (state council) (ELEC-TIONS) ORDERIN COUNCIL,1931.CEYLON (state council) ORDERIN COUNCIL,1931,ARTICLE 72,et seq.DITTO,ARTICLE 32,et seq.DITTO,ARTICLE 34,et seq.ROYALINSTRUCTIONS,ARTICLE 1.CEYLON (state council) ORDERIN COUNCIL,ARTICLE 22.DITTO,ARTICLE 49.

The matters reserved  to the executive control  cf the Officers  of  Stateinclude External  Affairs, Defence  and  the  Public Services,  under the  chief secretary; the administration of justice and the legal departments, and elections to the State Council,  under the Legal Secretary;  and the Treasury,  Customs,Stores and other financial departments, together  with establishments generally,under the Financial Secretary.  All other matters, including internal police, fallunder one or other of the Executive Committees. The Chief Secretary has a rightto attend the meetings of any Executive Committee; like the other Officers  OfState, he is a non-voting member of the Council and the Board of Ministers, andhe is chairman of the latter body.  Generally he acts as a liaison officer on behalfof the Governor!   The Financial Secretary is required to be consulted  in the formulation of all financial proposals.    7.  The Board of  Ministers, while not possessing full co-ordinative authority in matters of policy falling within the sphere of the Executive Committees,&apos;is charged corporately with  the important function of  preparing and submitting to the State Council the Annual Estimates of Revenue and Expenditure and anySupplementary Estimates.   Its Vice-Chairman,  elected by the Ministers from among their own number, is the Leader  of the State Council.  In the event  ofthe Budget being rejected by the Council or any vote  of the Council being made which appears to the  Governor to show that  the Board  no  longer enjoys theconfidence of the Council, the Governor is to dissolve the Council.    .    8.  Special provision is made for the  public service.  All  appointments,promotions, &amp;c, are under the control of the Governor; and no measure affectingthe salaries or conditions of service of officers may  be  introduced without his consent.  No measure prejudicing an officer who was already in the service whenthe new Constitution came into force, or an officer appointed  subsequently withthe approval of the Secretary of State  for the Colonies, may take effect withoutthe approval of the Secretary of State.   A Public Services Commission  has been set up to advise on the administration of the public service.   As  a matter  of practice,  a system of co-operative consultation with  the  various ExecutiveCommittees has  been  established  to deal with  individual  appointments andpromotions.  In addition to the above  provisions for the  protection of serving officers, pensions previously granted  are specially protected and  provision is madefor the voluntary  retirement  at any  time,  with  special pensions, of officersappointed with the  approval of the Secretary of  State prior to July 1928 (date&apos;of the publication of the Donoughmore Report).  Action necessary to carry out any of the provisions for the protection of the public service may be taken by theGovernor  in the exercise of his reserve powers (see paragraph 4).
proof:THE GOVERNORtoTHE SECRETARY OF STATE.(Received 21ST June/1938.)(Confidential.)SIR,Ceylon, 13TH June, 1938.       I. have the honour to address you with reference to paragraph 5 of Mr. Ormsby- Gore (now Lord Harlech&apos;s) despatch No. 763 dated the 25th November, 1937*, by which he instructed me carefully to examine the constitutional position, and when  I had had time to form conclusions and to acquaint myself with the views of all sections of opinion in the Island, to  submit any recommendations that  I might desire  to  make  for his consideration.     2. The enclosure to this despatch contains a list of the deputations to which I have granted interviews on this subject and of the memorials which I have received thereanent from associations and representative bodies.  I have  also received a large number of letters from private persons which I have placed on record but have not listed;  I have read them all through but, as they represent individual views only, no specific reference will be found to any  of them in this despatch.   Similarly I have had the advantage of a number of private conversations with members of most communities on constitutional questions.   In short  I  have done my  best in the  space of  six months &quot; to acquaint myself with the views of all sections of opinion in the Island &apos;&apos; and the remainder of this despatch will set forth the conclusions that I have ventured to form over the same period.     3. There are certain proposals of which I must recommend the rejection,  and I will deal with these first.   Foremost  is the proposal to restrict  the franchise; this will be found in the suggestions of the European Association and the Ceylon Moors&apos; Association and also in the account of my reception of a deputation from the All-Ceylon Protest Meeting, forwarded with  my  despatch No.  211 of the 2nd April, 1938F.   On page 84 of their  Report the  Donoughmore  Commissioners wrote of a proposal to raise  the minimum age for voters to 25 that &quot; In Great Britain it has been found  impracticable in this as  in  other matters to withdraw privileges already  conferred,  and this is no less true of Ceylon &quot;.  I concur; the  passage  is indeed still  more  applicable to  any proposal for the re-imposition of literary and property qualifications.  The suggestion seems to me outside the pale of practical politics.  The same  applies to any proposal to alter the regulations governing the Indian franchise.  It has  however been represented to me that these regulations have not been properly implemented.  That is a question not of constitutional reform but of tightening up  procedure, and as such it will receive my careful attention.     4. I have not entertained any of the various suggestions for the  curtailment of the Governors  powers.   In paragraph 4 of his  despatch  No. 763 of the 25th November, 1937J, Mr. Ormsby-Gore had already made known his decision that the time is not ripe for any relaxation of the special powers of the Governor.  Those powers in my opinion render any present proposal for  bicameral government unnecessary, and I&apos;have not therefore followed up  any of the suggestions which I have heard for the formation of a&apos; Second Chamber.   It is quite possible  however  that  the creation  of such a Chamber might form an item in the future constitutional development of the Island.     5. I have made  known  my opposition to what  is called here the &quot; Fifty-fifty demand &quot;.  This is that seats in  the State Council should be apportioned half to &quot; the majority community &quot;,  i.e.,  the Sinhalese, and half to the &quot; minority communities &quot;. I am similarly opposed to a &quot; sixty-forty demand &quot;  and to any other form of fractional representation on a race basis.  The elected seats must in my opinion continue to be filled on  a ^territorial  franchise though  (as will emerge  later in this despatch) I  would gladly see  the  electoral areas so  constituted as to  afford a  chance  of more seats for members  of minority  communities.  It  is  commonly  said that  the Donoughmore Constitution has resulted  in  an  enhancement of communalism, but in justice to theCommissioners it must  be remembered that (Report, page 102)  they recommended 65  elected  seats (which would have given  greater minority representation)  and had nothing to do with their subsequent reduction to 50.   My reason for opposition to thefifty-fifty demand or to  any modification of it is that any concession to the principle OF
communal representation would perpetuate sectionalism (which I believe to be anathemato thinking people in Ceylon of all races) and preclude the emergence of true political parties  on true political issues.  To  ease the present position by affording a  chanceof  more  seats for minority candidates is  one thing; to  introduce the principle  of representation of communities on any mathematical formula is quite another.    6. I  now  proceed  to  my constructive proposals and will  work from the  baseupwards.   I have already said that I recommend no alteration  of the franchise, but thatI am in favour of re-shaping, and adding to the number of, electoral areas in order to afford more chances for minority candidates.   Redelimitation is  also necessary in theKandyan  area in order that the Kandyan interest,  which is that of an agriculturalpeasantry, may not be swamped by the Indian interest,  which is that of plantationlabour.  I have had a number of specific proposals put before me, but I am not preparedto sponsor any of them without very careful prior examination by a Committee; andI shall not be in a position to appoint such a Committee until I know whether the schememeets with your approval.  The terms of reference to such a Committee would be:             &quot; To consider the present  electoral areas of the  Island and to advise what      changes or additions could be reasonably  made with a view to affording more      chances  for the return of candidates belonging to  the  minority  communities      and to securing adequate representation of the Kandyan rural interest &apos;&apos;.I anticipate that the Committee would, with the limitation of purpose inherent in these terms, find itself in a position to&apos; recommend not more  than ten additional seats.  I amonly too well aware that such a result, including as it would seats for the Kandyans,would be1  far  from meeting the aspirations  of the fifty-frftyite school; but, as I havealready made clear, I cannot endorse the demands of  that school in spite of  the force,persistence and clarity  with which they have  been  placed  before  me.  For a fullexposition of those demands I would refer you to  the memorial signed &quot; for and behalfof the minority communities of the Island &quot; by nine members of the State Council, whichI have sent to you with my Confidential despatch of the 19th May, 1938*.    7. European and Burgher interests  cannot of course be  represented in  the state council by members elected on a territorial basis;  I consider therefore that the presentmethod  of nomination should continue, but  would increase the Burgher representationfrom one  to two.  The Burgher Political Association in a written memorandum askedfor four, but  a deputation which I received from it acquiesced in  my proposal for two.I do  not  anticipate opposition against an  increase to two from  any quarter.   Thenumber of European nominees would remain at four.    8. In view of my proposal in paragraph 6, for additional  seats which may be wonby members of minority communities,  I do not anticipate the  necessity for any furthernominations in future beyond those dealt with  in the preceding paragraph.  It mighthowever be prudent to retain in reserve two nominable seats (thus bringing the maximumto the present figure of  eight) in  case some  interest might through unforeseen circum-stances go unrepresented.    9. I do not contemplate any change in  the qualifications  for membership of state council except the imposition of a new disability.  At a recent-date the allowances  ofho  fewer  than  fourteen out  of fifty elected members were under seizure by  Court.There is no doubt that such a state of affairs detracts from  the prestige of the Counciland from public confidence in its personnel.  It should be laid down that no member shalloccupy his seat while his allowance is under seizure, and that if it be under seizure  atany date posterior by three months or more to its first seizure the seat shall be heldvacated and a successor elected.  This provision should enable the retention of his seatby  a member who is able to effect a prompt and final composition with his  creditors,but ensure the vacation of his  seat by a member whose  indebtedness  is chronic  orrecurrent.    10.  At this point I embark on the large question of the machinery of the Constitution.My recommendations will be found to include the abolition of the Executive Committees;but I wish to record at the  outset an opinion which is shared by  every deputation and every individual  with whom I have  discussed constitutional  reform.  This is that  inthe event of a  continuance of the  system of Executive  Committees Public  Service&apos;Regulation 13 which requires reference to them on matters of appointment and  personnelmust be cancelled.  The idea of influence in high quarters dies hard  in England; less:than a year ago I was assured by a compatriot that I must have &quot; enjoyed influence &quot; *
or I should never have risen to my present position.  In the East the idea has. not yetbegun to die;  men in.a position  to  do so are expected by relatives and friends topromote their advancement as a matter of course.  There is indeed nothing intrinsicallyimmoral about nepotism;  but it is directly contrary to our accepted principles  ofequalisation of opportunity and appointment by worth.  It was  in my opinion unfair to the Executive Committees ever to have placed their members in a position in whichconflicts of loyalties were&apos;bound to arise.  If the Committees continue they must have nothing  whatever to do with the personnel of the public service.     11.  Some  of the  Minority representations press for the  retention  of ExecutiveCommittees on the ground that they form a safeguard to Minority interests.  It  is quitetrue that the presence  on each of them  of one or more Minority members means thatno  item of business or  deliberation can be  undertaken without the knowledge  of amember of  one or other of the Minority Communities.  If  the  Minorities  constituted a political party, if they possessed an identity of interest, or if they exhibited a constancyof cohesion and liaison I  might be  impressed by this consideration. &apos; But none of these things obtain as  far as my observation and  information go.   The presence of MinorityMembers on each Executive Committee not only failed to prevent the election of a pan-Sinhalese Ministry  but, if my information is correct, actually provoked it;  its  electionwas the Majority Community&apos;s answer  to the insistence by certain Minorities  on aretention of the Executive Committee System.  Only thus could  ministerial unanimityon  a plea for its abolition be achieved.     12.  If the Executive Committee system should be retained against the prayer of theMajority Community I therefore foresee  a succession of Pan-Sinhalese Ministries.  Onlya communal distribution of seats, on a fifty-fifty basis or some approximation to it,could prevent it; and as I have already stated  I  am  opposed to such a distribution.Moreover if Minority Ministers were elected as the result of a communal distribution of seats the Board of Ministers could  never be  a consentaneous body; for they would be divided on fundamentals  of the Constitution. Of the Pan-Sinhalese Ministry it can at,least be  said that, so far  as the present  Constitution admits,  it  provides an element ofcongruence.  But it will be convenient to state here that not a single Sinhalese leaderwith whom I have  spoken has expressed himself in favour of a Pan-Sinhalese Ministry:;on  the contrary they deplore what they regard as its present necessity.     13.  The principal  defects of the Executive Committee System may be summarizedas follows:         (a) Administration has become cumbrous and dilatory, the Committee agenda,             which  I  regularly see, are inordinately overloaded, with  a  resultant loss             of perspective.  At the meetings much ado is often made about small things,             while  big questions receive too  summary a treatment.       (6) Administration has become centrifugal; each Committee  goes its own  way             without any common direction or control.  Where  overlapping is recog-             nised  and a  matter dealt  with  by more  than  one Committee procedure             becomes  still more cumbrous and dilatory.       (c) The  fact that the Ministers owe ministerial office to their having been elected             by the Committees as their Chairmen  means that they have no common             allegiance.   Their authority is  not original but derivative, and therefore             intrinsically weak.       (d) Even though collective responsibility  for financial measures has been vested             in the Board of Ministers by Article 57  of the Order in Council the initial             preparation of the estimates has been entrusted  to&apos; the responsibility of the             Executive Committees by  Clause  1  of the Statement  of Administrative             Procedure Gazette Notification  No.  7858/1931.  The  Board wields  the             blue pencil but it does not mould the budget.       (e) To   summarize  this  summary  there  is  no  determining,  co-ordinating,             eliminating,  controlling  or designing  force behind  the  administrative         v    machine; everything  depends upon  bargaining and compromise.  As&quot; a             result there  can be no  fixation  and concentration either of  policy or of             responsibility.     14. In fairness to the Executive Committees I wish to state that a great deal of hard and useful work has been done on them. Their defects are inherent in the system andnot in the manner of its operation.  I considered for some time the idea of retaining theCommittees in a consultative instead of an executive capacity. I reached the conclusionhowever that the memory of their executive past would make them discontented withand impatient of a consultative future.  Such retention would moreover involve manyof the delays, and much of the dispersion of responsibility, that mar the present system.
  -  .  15. I  therefore counsel the abolition  of  the Executive  Committees  and,  if this recommendation were approved, there would necessarily vanish with them the present Board of Ministers who are elected by them.  The functions of both, i.e. the Executive Committees and the  Board of Ministers, could then be entrusted to a Cabinet of the normal type.   In such a Cabinet, however,  the  Officers  of State could find no place. Their present position  on  the  present  State Council and  Board &quot;pf Ministers is  one  of great and acknowledged difficulty; it is only rendered possible by the fact that under the present constitution the fall of a Ministry involves the dissolution of  Council.   The Members&apos; fear of a dissolution, because of the election risks and costs that would follow, has  in fact given to themselves and to the Ministers a security of tenure which approx- imates to that of the Officers of State.   If however the position were that a Ministry could fall  and be replaced without a dissolution, but that  the  Officers of  State  remained a constant factor  in successive  Ministries, their position  would  be so invidious as  to become impossible.      16. I have  reached the opinion that the fall of a first or second Ministry after a general election should  not necessarily involve a dissolution, but that the Governor should at those  stages dissolve  the Council only if in his judgment there is an issue that can  and should  be put to determination by a general election.  The fall of a subsequent ministry should incur  dissolution  unless the  Governor  sees  reason to the  contrary. I am not alone  in this opinion; it has been pressed on me from several quarters.  We have at present  no major political parties in the true and  full  sense of the term.  Their evolution is  indeed improbable, if  not  impossible,  under the present system which affords  no  opportunity for the fall and  rise of Ministries, for the  moulding  and crystallization of policies,  and thereby  for  orientated  Government  and orientated Opposition.  Until this evolution takes place and there are before the electorate political programmes on  which a vote can be intelligently given for this side or for that electioneer- ing  must tend  to  consist in a parade  of personalities,  irresponsible  promises,  and objectionable  appeals to race,  caste or creed.   It is said on all sides that  Sectionalism has  increased under  the present Constitution;  but my  observation is that its increase is limited to the political field  and has  not extended to the every day walks of life where there is a large  measure of fellowship and understanding.   Nor is  it surprising that in the absence of any other criterion electors  should vote on communal lines;  it is indeed  the most intelligent course at  present  open  to  them.   I  consider  it therefore imperative to remove the obstructions to  the emergence and growth of a! party system; it is equally important that the Officers of State should  not become embroiled  in party politics, and their removal from the Ministry and from the State Council would therefore follow as a corollary of the introduction of the Cabinet system.   I will return  to their case later.      17. If the  introduction of  a Cabinet system  commends itself to you  the  question arises as  to how the Cabinet should be  formed.   I have  had three suggestions under consideration, all of which postulate that  the  Chief  Minister in consultation with the  Governor should pick his men for the remaining portfolios.  With this postulate I agree; it is the only method of assuring a harmonious and disciplined team.  The suggestions are:          (a)  that  the State Council should elect  a  leader, and the  person so elected be              appointed Chief Minister by the Governor;        (b)  that  the members of the State Council should each nominate three  persons              in secret  ballot,  to be opened  by  the  Governor  in  the  presence of the              Chief Justice; and that the person  receiving most nominations should be              asked by the Governor to form a Ministry:  in the case of a tie the Governor              would decide  between the two nominees;        (c) that  the Governor should of his own  initiative and discretion  send for the              man most likely  in his opinion  to  command public confidence  as Chief              Minister.4 Against (a) it is contended that a lot of canvassing and manoeuvring for portfolios would  result;  and against (&amp;), which was designed to obviate this contingency, that it would  merely multiply the manoeuvres.  The objection to (c) is that it might impose too great  a responsibility  on the Governor; his first nomination would however be dictated by past  political history, and future politics would provide the pointer for subsequent selections.  I believe the objections to (a) and (&amp;) to be sound and therefore recommend (c).      18.  I have already written, at the close of paragraph  12,  that  &quot;not  a single  Sinhalese leader with whom I have  spoken has expressed himself in favour of a Pan-  Sinhalese  Ministry:  on the contrary they deplore what they  regard as its  present  necessity &quot;.   I  have found a similar attitude on  the part of Sinhalese deputations, and-
if there should be constitutional reform along the lines now suggested I have little doubtthat we  shall have seen  the  first and last pan-Sinhalese Ministry.  The right of the-Governor to decline to appoint  a  person as Minister  (Article 35  (2) of the Order inCouncil) should of course  be retained, but it has been suggested to me that the governor should exercise this right in such a manner as to secure a percentage of portfolios for the minorities.  With this suggestion  I profoundly disagree; nor do I consider that it shouldbe definitely laid down irMhe Order in Council that the Ministry  must be representativeof all communities.  Such a provision would give rise to varieties of  interpretation andthus lead to heartburnings and disgruntlement.  On the other hand I consider that theRoyal Instructions to the  Governor should contain a clause similar to  that in the IndianInstructions which  reads  as follows:             &quot; VIII.   In making appointments to his Council of Ministers Our Governor       shall use his  best endeavours to select his Ministers in the following manner, that       is to say, in consultation with the person who in his judgment is likely to command       a  stable majority in the Legislature to appoint those persons [including so far as       practicable members of important minority communities)  who will be best in a       position  to command the  confidence of the Legislature.   But, in  so acting, he       shall bear constantly in mind the need for fostering a sense of joint responsibility       among his Ministers.&quot;     19. With the  formation  of  a  Cabinet all  the powers  and responsibilities  of an executive Committee and all the executive functions  of the State  Council would pass to the appropriate Minister; but Cabinet approval would be necessary for any ministerialmeasure,  decision,  programme, or order involving increased expenditure, creation oralteration of general or departmental policy,  or departure from established pactice on major matters.  -Measures,  legislative  or executive, at present requiring gubernatorialapproval  or ratification  would  still  require  such approval  and  ratification.   It isconvenient however at this point to state that many formal acts  of approval which thelaw  at present requires to be performed by the Governor should, with the advent of responsible  Ministers, be  placed  within  the legal  compass of the appropriate Ministereither by delegation or statute.     20. The State Councillors, if relieved  of their  work on the  Executive Committees,should not  receive  their present  rate of allowance; which is Rs.500 per mensem.  Ithas been suggested to me that Rs.200 or Rs.250 would be a suitable and adequate figure,but this is not a matter which should  be fixed by the Constitution.  I  mention it herebecause, whatever reasonable reduction were decided upon, the resultant savings should cover remuneration of the extra seats recommended in paragraph 6  of this despatch andalso appropriate allowances  to  Ministers&apos;  Deputies,  corresponding  to  parliamentary under Secretaries.  The necessity for such Deputies under the proposed scheme needs&quot;little argument; public exigency or other force of circumstances  might  at  any timepreclude a Ministers presence in Council, and there must be somebody there qualified and,authorized to speak and answer on his behalf.   The appointment  of such Deputies&apos;would be made by the Chief Minister  in  consultation  with  the  other members of theCabinet,  and each nomination would require the Governors approval.  A figure ofRs.750 a month has been mentioned  to me as suitable  remuneration for a Minister&apos;^Deputy,  but this  again  should  not be fixed by  the  Constitution.  Members of the minority Communities would doubtless find themselves numbered among these Deputies.     21. Any Minister  or any Minister&apos;s  Deputy  would of course have  to resign ifrequested to do so by the Chief Minister with the  consent of a majority in his Cabinet.The whole Ministry would have to resign on the passing by the State Council of a vote of non-confidence.   Resignation  after defeat on  any  ministerial  measure  should  bevoluntary  and not compulsory;  such  defeat could always be pressed  home  by a subsequent  vote of  non-confidence, but on the other hand it might be followed  byreasonable compromise or accommodation.    22. I now come back to the Officers  of State. If,  as I earnestly hope, a partysystem should emerge from the  proposals that I  have  adumbrated in the preceding paragraphs  the presence  of non-elected and permanent  Officers of State  in  the  state council would become an impossible anomaly.  They would be set upon from all sides.Moreover their tenure of Ministerial portfolios, which is  the present position, would beimpossible without their presence  in  State Council.  A  radical change in the theory and;practice of  their functions  would therefore be necessitated by the adoption  of my,previous  recommendations.   Their  constitutional  position   should  be   definitely:;unministerial.  I will now deal with the three offices individually.
-    23. The.&quot; Subjectsv.and- Functionsallocated to the Chief Secretary are:   -    , j (i): External Affairs.-  As  the  foreign relations  of the  Island are in the hands;   : -    \- ;    of the  Imperial  Government,  and  as all  important  communications  to             other Governments  are  over the signature of the  Governor,  there is no-             need to retain this category.  When correspondence with  another Govern-             menfbecomes necessary the Ministry concerned could prepare  the required;-.            despatches.   -       (ii) Emigration, Immigration  and Repatriation. -  So  fair  as  the  emigration,             immigration and repatriation  of labourers  is concerned, these subjects             could be transferred to the Ministry of Labour, Industry and Commerce;             as regards other classes of the population  to the Home Ministry.      (iii) Extradition and Fugitive Offenders. This is  a subject for the Home Ministry.      (iy) Maldive Islands. All correspondence is between the Governor and the Sultan;             sub-paragraph (i) above applies.       (v) Aliens.  Could be transferred to the  Home Ministry.      (vi) Consuls and Passports.  This head covers routine work only; the work can             continue to  be done where it now is on behalf of  the Governor.     (vii) Commercial Treaties could be transferred to Ministry of Labour, Industry and             Commerce; see also sub-paragraph  (i) supra.    (viii) Merchant Shipping could be transferred to the Ministry of Labour, Industry             and Commerce.      (ix) Wrecks and Salvage to the Home Ministry.       (x) Lighthouses and Beacons to the Ministry of  Communications and Works.      (xi) Administration of the Public Services and Grant of Leave would be  by the             Governor on the advice of the  Public Services Commission.     (xii) Government Quarters and Office Accommodation could be transferred to the             Ministry of  Communications and Works;    (xiii) Custody of Archives should be the work of  the Museums Department under             the Ministry of Education;    (xiv) Naval, Military and Defence matters should be dealt with by the Governor             in close liaison with the Cabinet;     (xv) Civil Aviation has already been  transferred  to the Ministry of Communica-             tions and Works.I will revert  to the question of the Chief Secretary&apos;s future title, status  and functionslater in this despatch.    24. Doubts have been expressed to me as  to whether the appointment of legal secretary (or Legal  Adviser,  as  he would  become) should be permanently retainedunder a reformed Constitution.  I am however satisfied that in the first stages of  reform and for some years  to come he will  be greatly needed to give  independent  advice on constitutional questions.   He  would  continue to  advise  the  Governor  regarding  hisexercise of the Royal clemency and his assent to legislation, and continue to serve bothon the Public Services Commission and as President of the Judicial Appointments  Board.I  deem it advisable  moreover that he should remain the authority responsible  for the organisation  and management of elections to the  State Council.  He would also beavailable to preside over Commissions of Inquiry  and Disciplinary Proceedings:  in factI  anticipate that he would be a  very busy  officer and not in  the event found to bedispensable.   His present ministerial  &quot; subjects  and  functions &quot; under the headingsAdministration of Justice, Criminal Prosecutions and Civil Proceedings on behalf of the.Crown, Drafting of Legislation and Functions of the Public Service should be transferredto one of the Ministries and in a later paragraph I shall suggest that it should be to theMinistry for  Home Affairs.    25. The  &quot; Subjects and Functions &quot; of the Financial Secretary as set out on  page 8OF &quot; The Ceylon Government Manual of Procedure &quot; contain fourteen items  under the heading &quot; Establishments &quot; which include much debatable ground between him and theChief Secretary.  I consider that these items together  with the whole office and  staffOF the Controller of Establishments should be put under  the Public Services Commission;this would at once remove the debatable ground and  relieve the Financial SecretaryOF a large  volume of routine work that affords him too little time for consideration  of;major financial questions.  I  will come to  the  future composition and scope  of thePublic Services Commission in a later paragraph.  ,                                  &apos;
    26. The remainder of the Financial Secretary&apos;s functions would be transferred to ahew Minister for Finance, subject to the following arrangements.  I had at first thought of recommending that the Financial Secretary should be re-named Financial Counsellorand (with the exception that he should retain his Presidency of all important FinancialBoards and Commissions, on the ground that Governmental direction and supervision of currency, banks and?similar matters must be as expert, authoritative and permanentas possible) be placed  in a purely advisory relationship  to the  Finance Minister, theCabinet and the Governor.  The Ministers have however impressed upon me their viewthat the Financial  Secretary  should  in  addition to his functions as an  independentadviser exercise an executive and responsible  control over the Treasury under theFinance Minister.  This would of course place him in a  dual relationship to the finance minister;  as an executive Officer he  would be subject  to Ministerial direction, but as financial Adviser he would be outside the administrative machine with rights of addressand of access not only to the  Finance  Minister but also  to the  Cabinet and to theGovernor.  The  Ministers,  while  appreciating  the objection that  dualisms of  this character can lead to misunderstanding  and possible friction, contend that &quot; a strongTreasury &quot;  is a paramount  necessity, and that unless the  Financial Secretary (whowould be the Government&apos;s financial expert) were identified with its control the  Treasurycould not command the authority nor exercise the restraint that is essential. These arevery practical and prescient considerations, and I have  less hesitation in associatingmyself with them  when I reflect that the projected dualism has its counterpart to  aconsiderable extent in the new status  of a Financial Secretary under the ordinary typeof Colonial Administration.  To emphasize the duality of his status and functions I would suggest that the title &quot; Financial Secretary &quot; should be  altered to  &quot; Financial secretary and Adviser &apos;&apos;, though the title of the officer in operative charge of the Treasury should remain, as at present, &quot; Deputy Financial Secretary &quot;.  I desire to add that in view ofthe importance of sound finance to  the Cabinet as a whole the Financial Secretary andAdviser should have the  right  of  address  and  access  to it not  only in his  advisory capacity,  but  also in his executive  capacity in the  event of his disagreement with any direction of the Finance Minister.    27. The Financial  Secretary and Adviser and the Legal Adviser would  thus  beadvisers to  the Governor and to the  Cabinet.  They  would not  however be  advisers to the  State Council, and the observations  of the Financial Secretary provided for by article  57  (2) of the present Order in Council would  be discontinued.  The cabinet would have to shoulder complete responsibility for all  measures introduced by them;all  that the Constitution  should provide is that no measure with financial  or  legalimplications could be introduced without  full and  prior consultation by the Cabinet withthe appropriate Adviser.  The Governors powers to refuse assent or decline ratificationshould remain essentially as  they  now  are, and reports  by the  Legal  and FinancialAdvisers continue to be forwarded to the Secretary of State with all new legislation.The Constitution should also lay it  down that no vote of  non-Confidence in a Ministrycould  be  moved on  an issue in which  a  measure passed by the Council had  beendisallowed by His Majesty or refused assent or ratification by the  Governor, or on anyissue arising out of an Order  by His  Majesty in Council or a Governors Ordinance.    28. At this point it will be convenient to deal with the question of the Public Services -Commission.  It is common ground in all representations that have been made to methat the Commission should be independent (i.e., that it should be beyond the reach of politics on the one hand and beyond any suspicion of  Service influence on the other)and that it should be either wholly or partly unofficial.   I am not prepared for a moment to admit that  the present Commission has been anything but fully independent, but Inevertheless realize that the absence  of any unofficial element and die fact that theChief Secretary is  a member of the  local service renders its composition open to criticalcomment.   My proposals regarding the Chief Secretaryship will be found to remove thesecond ground for criticism,  and my recommendation is that the present composition beretained with the addition of not more than three Unofficials nominated by the Governorior a period of three years  with extensions  at  his discretion.   I would  choose  such members  from among  ex-judges of  the  Supreme  Court and  other  gentlemen whosestanding and reputation commands  absolute confidence  and  respect.  They would haveto be paid an allowance, which should  be fixed with due regard to pension already drawn,if any.  I would appoint only two in the first instance so  that,  if the appointment of legal Adviser were eventually to vanish, the Board, would not be left with an unofficialmajority.    29. The status of. the Commission is essentially advisory (Article 89 of the Orderin Council)  but the Governor would  delegate to its chairman, he., the Chief secretary by whatever name he is called, all  the routine concerning postings, etc., of other than
 the most senior officers.  The only appointments and transfers that should be referred for the views of the Cabinet are those, of the Head, or Deputy. Head, of a Department or of a Government  Agency.  All advice concerning appointment,  promotion, transfer * dismissal and disciplinary control (Article 86) would  come direct from the Commission to. the Governor; but advice regarding salaries, cadre and all the other subjects listed under the heading&quot; Establishments &quot;  in the present Subjects  and Functions of  the Financial Secretary  (Manual of  Procedure,  page 8) would come to  the  Goyernor through the Finance Minister,  who would of course make reference to  the Cabinet  whenever he considered it necessary.  As I  have stated in paragraph 25 the transference of the Establishments office from Treasury control to that of  the Public Service Commission will prevent overlapping  and overburdening of the Treasury.     30. It will be  well at this juncture to face the fact that  references to  the Governor through the Finance Minister under the last paragraph would furnish the majority of points  on  which differences between him and the Cabinet would be likely to  arise or develop, and on which he might have to resort to action under Article 22.  The source of this likelihood  lies  in paragraph (4) on page  131  of  the Donoughmore  Report, reproduced in paragraphs  28 and 31 on page 153, and reflected in Articles 86-90 of the Order  in Council.   It might  be that a careful redefinition of the powers reserved to the Secretary  of State  and the  Governor might  reduce the  opportunities for  friction, but it would certainly  not  remove the  chances of disagreement.   The Ministers desire complete control over the pay, privileges, prospects  and  pensions of all public servants, which is contrary to the Donoughmore Scheme.  Your predecessor was not prepared to consider, nor am  I to  recommend, any recession from  the  Donoughmore standpoint; and a  field  for disagreement must consequently  remain.  It  can only be hoped  that good sense and understanding  on both sides  will  minimize  the  danger of occasional disagreement developing into chronic friction.     31. The Ministers,  and others, have suggested  that the  time  has come to amend Article 88  of the Order in Council by setting a time limit within which persons  holding office at the commencement of the Order can exercise their option to retire.  I am unable to  endorse this suggestion because it was  definitely  the  intention  of the Donoughmore Commission  that (Report  page 128) &quot; it should be a  continuous option not  for a specific period  but  throughout  the period of  each  officer&apos;s  service  under  the  Ceylon Government&quot;. The Ministers have however made  a  further representation that, if no time limit  can  be set to the  option, Article 88 should be  so amended as to allow of the Special Pension Regulations being  altered to provide that the compensatory  addition should  be  granted  only if the Governor is satisfied  that an officers retirement  does in fact represent loss of career.  With this representation I find myself in accord: it is  true that  the   Donoughmore  Commission  recommended   that  &quot; the  right  should  be unqualified &quot;,  but  the Commissioner can hardly have anticipated  the abuses to which it is being  put.  Two illustrative cases have much perturbed me recently.   The first is that of a Ceylonese Civil Servant who is about to retire in order to take up an important Municipal  appointment for  which he applied;  so far indeed from entailing a  loss of career his retirement is motivated by an opportunity  to improve his  career.   The second case is  that of an Assistant Matron who, having last year been granted  an extension of her service beyond the normal age for compulsory retirement,  applied this year to retire under Article 88 with a compensatory pension.   The premise of the Donoughmore Commission^ recommendation was:             &apos;,&apos; The further  reforms which we have  recommended  will deprive public       officers of the opportunity of rising to the  control of their Departments and by      placing them under Ministers will constitute so fundamental an alteration in their      conditions of service  that  there will, in our view, be no alternative but  to give      them the right to retire on proportionate pension  with compensation for loss of      career.&quot;Article  88  and the Special  Pension Regulations do not appear to me to apply  thispremise, with  the result  that compensation is beng awarded where there  is  no  losswhatever to compensate for.    32. I now  revert to the  question of the future status of the Chief Secretaryship.   Inparagraph  23 I have indicated that the subjects and functions which at present  requirehis presence in Council can be distributed between other Ministries and the Governor.Measures affecting the Public Services could be introduced in Council either  by the chief minister, the Finance Minister or the Minister in control of the Department  concernedafter  consultation  between  Governor and  Cabinet.  The Chief  Minister could also.
introduce any measure dealing with Naval, Military and  Defence Matters  after similarConsultation.   The other distributed subjects present no difficulty.  The Chief Secretary&apos;sordinary functions would therefore consist of:         (a) Chairmanship  of the Public Services Commission;  and       (6) Principal Secretaryship  to  the Governor.I also consider it most important  that he  should  act for the Governor, whenever thelatter is ill or on leave.  I am aware that the Leader of the State Council is averse fromthis arrangement and would prefer that the Chief  Justice  should hold the dormantCommission.   I consider  however that in  principle  the  Judicature should be kept as distinct as possible from  the Administration and that periods of gubernatorial absenceshould involve as little dislocation of work and  personnel  as possible.  If by somemischance both Governor and Chief Secretary were incapacitated or absent at the sametime then, I agree, the Chief Justice might have to be called upon; but not otherwise.If you agree  with this view  the recent crisis in Orissa makes it desirable to appoint tothe Chief Secretaryship in future an officer who has never occupied a position subordinateto a Ceylon Minister.  This consideration  has  indeed already been given publicity ina leading article of a local  newspaper.  I contemplate  therefore that your selectionswould henceforward be from outside, and  this would meet also one of the points  putforward  in paragraph 28  of this despatch.    33.  The  authority of the  officer so appointed would derive from the Governorin all matters; he would in no sense occupy a ministerial position under the  constitution as the Chief  Secretary now  does.  To mark this change  of constitutional  status some alteration of title might appear advisable, and I would suggest &quot; Principal  Secretary tothe Governor &quot;. .    34.  I have duly considered paragraph  12 of Mr. Ormsby-Gore&apos;s despatch No.  763of the  18th December,  1937*, but I do not wish to recommend that provision for essentialpublic services should be made  non-votable.   The  reason  for my  disinclination istwofold; first that differentiations within a public service might be bad for  the Service,leading to complexes of superiority and inferiority and to the loss of a common espritde  corps:  second, that  it would run counter  to  the  intention  of  the  DonoughmoreCommission,  vide the  underlined portions of the following quotation from  page 131 oftheir Report:             &quot; The provision in the new Order in Council of an Article providing that the       final decision in all matters affecting  the pay and allowances, pensions, prospects       and conditions  of  service of public  officers  shall be vested in the Secretary of       State, leaving it to be understood that the Council would be free to offer comment       and criticism, as hitherto.&quot;In his despatch No.  763  Mr. Ormsby-Gore wrote that selected changes could not beexpected to produce good results unless they were  adopted with the general consent ofall  important interests in  Ceylon.   I have therefore refrained from including in this despatch  proposals certain to evoke a  general storm  of protest among  which  any suggestion for the creation of non-votable Services would  certainly be numbered.    35. I have throughout my deliberations on  constitutional  reform been governed bya desire to interfere with the  Donoughmore  Scheme as little as possible.   Where I havenot counselled change I contemplate a continuance of the present order.   I am howeverconvinced that the Executive Committee  system, as it has developed, is cumbrous and unsatisfactory and that a trial  should be made of the Cabinet system.  Most of  therecommendations that  I have made are dictated by the necessities of a Cabinet system.The success of  democracy in Ceylon  depends in my view on the discipline and drivewhich  party loyalties  can alone infuse into democracy.  The present State Council isa political debating society rather  than a Government.  Nobody is to blame  for this because the present constitution in solving the difficulty of an absence of parties appearsto me  to have  done  so at the  cost of precluding  their future emergence.   I  am  not however so sanguine  or  so blind as to anticipate  that  the introduction of a Cabinet-system and the rise and fall of Ministries would have the immediate effect of  dividing thecountry into two major political parties.   For  years to come parties might be manyand some of them wear a communal complexion, so that  Cabinets would probably becoalition Cabinets.  Nevertheless  there must be a political  basis for coalition,  andcleavages would ensue on other than purely intercommunal lines.
     36. The alterations which I have adumbrated would involve the creation of two; hew Ministries, a Chief Ministry and a Ministry of Finance.  The.portfolio of the former should be kept as light as possible, so that the chief Minister might have sufficient time, for the coordinative work and thought essential to efficient leadership.  Most of the depart- mental responsibilities at present vested in the Legal Secretary should in my view be allocated  to  the Ministry for Home Affairs;  and  this would probably necessitate an all-round  rearrangement  of  ministerial  functions.  The portfolios  as  at  present constituted do not indeed strike me either as equally balanced or as perfectly categorized^ I do not however propose at this stage to subscribe to any definite plan of reallocation; it would  be a matter for careful and detailed consultation with the Ministers.  I  have heard the  criticism that nine Ministers would be too many and one (Sinhalese) deputation represented  that some of the existing Ministries do not provide a day&apos;s work, and for that reason  opposed  the proposal for Ministers&apos; Deputies.  I do not however agree; for it must  always be remembered of Ceylon that administration is made much  more difficult by  the myriads of petitions that have  to  be  considered and replied to.  No regulation is ever  passed,  no  scheme  proposed, no order  given, no  salary  fixed, no pension computed, no sentence of Court pronounced, no land alienated, no appointment or promotion made, in short no action  of any kind taken or mooted, without a spate of memorials, protests or petitions.  The large majority  of them lie outside all law and reason, but  the interests of goodwill and  contentment in the  Island demand  a patient examination of them and a  carefully considered reply.     37. I  have essayed to keep this despatch within reasonable bounds by representing my recommendations in the  form of a framework within  which much detail would  need to  be arranged and fitted together  before  it  could be  properly  called a scheme for constitutional reform; I have attempted only a prospectus.  It would indeed  be waste of time to elaborate details until judgment has been passed on essentials.  I am under no  illusion  that  the  adoption of  my  proposals would  spell  the  end  of present difficulties or the avoidance of new ones; on the contrary I foresee mountains of difficulty ahead for Ministers, Advisers and Governor alike.  The mainspring of my recommenda- tions lies in the first of my instructions under the Royal Sign Manual, that I shall  have regard to His Majesty&apos;s desire to promote by the Ceylon (State Council) Order in Council, 1931, the devolution upon the inhabitants of Ceylon of responsibility for the management of the internal affairs of  the Island.  It is because I cannot perceive in the Executive Committee System  as  I find it developed the germs of true responsibility that I counsel its  replacement by a Cabinet system.  It may be true that the Executive Committees have developed wrongly, that they have usurped the functions of the Ministers and the Ministers  those of the Heads  of  Departments.  The fact nevertheless remains  that as things are responsibility is, to use the Ministers&apos; expression, fugacious; which is but a euphemism for non-existent.     38. My  proposals will not  meet the demands of the Ministers nor of the various Sinhalese  associations because they envisage no curtailment of the Governor&apos;s powers; nor will they meet the demands of most of the Minority associations in that they refuse assent to  the doctrine of communal representation.  The European Association  and Ceylon Moors&apos; Association will disapprove  my refusal to recommend a restriction of the franchise,  and probably also the advocated withdrawal  of  the  Officers of State from State Council.  The only body in fact with whose representations my recommendations almost  entirely tally is the  newly  formed  Burgher Political Association  of Ceylon. Whether in these circumstances my selection of  changes could be adopted &quot;  with the general consent of  all important interests in Ceylon &quot;  is  doubtful; and I could  not of course resolve the doubt by reference to representative bodies without prior submission to you  and receipt of your instructions.  I  have shown this  despatch in draft to the Officers of State and Ministers, impressing on them that it represents solely  my  own recommendations (put forward for your consideration in accordance with the instruction contained  in  Mr. Ormsby-Gore (now  Lord Harlech&apos;s)  despatch No.  763/1937  and without any  prognostication whatever  of your approval or disapproval) and that its contents must be  kept entirely confidential unless and until  you authorize to  the contrary.   39. The appointment of a Commission is urged by some and deprecated by others. If one were  appointed I would suggest that it  should not  invite  or accept further representations, but work and find on those already received.   Every opportunity hasbeen given for the  putting forward  of  every sort of view from every  quarter,  and itwould be to no advantage to provide the opportunity  for vain repetition;  it  would indeed merely add  to the time and cost of a Commission.
     40. The suggestions which I have made in  this despatch would involve, if effectwere given to any  large proportion  of them,  so many  amendments of the Ceylon(State Council) Order in Council as to render advisable the substitution of an entirely new Order.  In such  new Order a  great deal of improvement could be  made on thepresent one in regard to phraseology, arrangement and definition.  I do not, for instance,wish my  refusal  to consider any curtailment of  the Governors present poavers  to beconstrued as meaning that those powers could not be better and more exactly defined.On the contrary, the India and Burma Acts and their ancillary documents  exhibit amuch finer precision of definition and clarity of intention than do Ceylon&apos;s constitutionalinstruments and  literature.   Unfortunately  however  (and this is very important) thelatter command the fondness that comes of familiarity and the respect that is  ever andeverywhere paid  to  foundational documents.  I do not therefore anticipate  that  anywholesale borrowing  from the  Indian or Burman models would meet with a  readyacceptance; though in a number of contexts they might provide the satisfactory solution.     41. In conclusion I would  like to set down my impressions of three main difficultieswhich beset administration and hinder political  development in this Island.     (a) The Public Service looms far too prominently in the thoughts and attentions ofthe  Islanders.   Employment  under  Government  provides  a  social  cachet whichapproaches almost to that of a ruling caste.  The result is threefold; first, comes the  desire of every parent to see a son get a Government job, and  intense jealously if that jobfalls to somebody of a different  family, caste, or race.  The extent to which this  obsessionobtains may be illustrated by  a proposal which was made to me, though  not in  any official representations, that appointments to  Clerkships should be by rotation betweenthe races.  I have no  doubt whatever that a great deal of the communalism that is sounfortunately rampant derives directly, from competition and jealousy about Governmentappointments.-  The second result is  a temptation for public servants even of  low rankto acquire and manifest  something of the psychology of a ruling caste;  and  the  thirda consequent  resentment against their position,  privileges  and pay and a prejudicedcriticism of their doings by State Councillors and others engaged or interested in politics.Such resentment and criticism does not however militate against an unsalutary interest ontheir part in appointments to the public service.     (6) The relation between Minister and Head  of Department has sometimes becomestrained through  a lack,  so it seems to me, of any definition  of what that relationship.should be.  The Minister is  responsible to the State Council and so to the Country forthe policy and programme  of each  department under  his charge; the  Head of theDepartment is responsible to  the Minister  for the  carrying  out of  both policy  andprogramme and  also for furnishing him with the  necessary  professional or  technicaladvice when policy is being shaped or a programme drawn up.  Such advice shouldbe fully recorded, and if  the Minister should disregard it he does so on his  own responsibility-responsibility.  The Head of Department must unreservedly carry out-the Minister&apos;s directionson programme and policy even if he considers them wrong; the Minister, not he, isanswerable  to the Country.  On the  other hand  the Minister should not interfere inmatters of departmental personnel or internal working: the departmental engine can beefficiently driven  only if  there  is a single hand on the regulator.  Conversely  the linesalong which it shall run are determined by the  Minister; the engine-driver  must not attempt to be his own pointsman.     (c) Lastly there is a tendency here in most  public utterance  to speak or write insuperlatives and with the loud pedal perpetually down.   Claims are over-stated,  factsover-emphasized,  situations overpainted and differences exaggerated; with a consequentjettison of ballast and perspective.   This is  hardly  surprising when every  politicianis his own leader and there are no party programmes, policies or loyalties.  It is because i believe that  the Cabinet System is  necessary in order to fix and develop Governmentresponsibility, to render possible the emergence and evolution of political parties, and soto infuse discipline into democracy that I have made the recommendations containedin this despatch.  I have written it under stress of much work and many engagements,and  if it contains  repetitions and faults of arrangement I trust that they may be for that reason excused.                                                     I have, &amp;c,                                                            A. CALDECOTT,                                                                      Governor.
