BE KEPT UMDER LOCK AMD KEY.It Is requested that special care may be taken to   ensure the secrecy of this document(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJ:E STY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.)S E C RET.CP. 268 (58) .COPY NO.          CABINET.      ASSISTANCE TO CHINA.Note &quot;by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.1.     The memorandum &quot;by the Secretary of  State  forForeign Affairs (CP.266(38)) adduces arguments  i-nfavour of the proposal to guarantee  a loan of  3millions for the support of the Chinese  currency.   the considerations urged &quot;by Sir- A. Clark Kerr following upon his conversation with General Chiang  Kai-Shek-raise issues of great importance and of  coursedeserve the most close examination.some of which are not fully developed in the Secretaryof State&apos;s memorandum, which I think my colleagues ought frto weigh before arriving at a decision.that in July last the Cabinet decided  against  proposalsfor financial support, provided &quot;by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, for China.  In view of the great importance which the Secretary of State attaches  to his proposalI have searched anxiously for any new  circumstances which could be held to justify a reversal  of thedecision taken by the Cabinet on that  occasion.3.     It appears indeed that the demands  from theChinese Government for help have become more pressing,but I notice that the Secretary of State himself doesnot suggest that developments in the meantime  haveNevertheless, there are other considerations,2.The Secretary of State&apos;s memorandum recalls
justified a departure from the decision taken by the Cabinet onthe 13th July so far as a loan for purely political purposes isconcerned.  That point &quot;being conceded it would seem that we havenot got to consider again the question of general assistance to china, &quot;but that our examination may he confined to the merits ofthe particular proposal now put forward and to consideration ofthe point how far it escapes from being a loan for purely politicalpurposes.4.     The proposal is one for a Bank credit to support theexchange value of the Chinese, national currency.   The ChineseGovernment are said to contemplate the establishment of astabilisation fund for  stabilising the Chinese dollar at itspresent rate.  The Chinese banks are said to be ready tocontribute a total of  3 million provided that British Bankswill jointly advance a similar amount towards the fund.5.     Assistance to the Chinese currency is a worthy object in itself and throughout the period of close examination whichhas been given to these suggestions by authorities in the City,I have been most careful not in any way to influence their judgment against the scheme, but on the other hand to encourage them to see what could be done.  Their response has convincedme there is no hope at all of the scheme being adopted as acommercial proposition.  The Hong Kong and Shanghai Bankoffered to put up  500,000 if the Bank of China put up 3 million, but attached impossible conditions to the offer,viz.  that the Bank of England should guarantee any loss on afurther amount of  2-?? million and that the Hong Kong Bankitself should have full discretionary power to operate thefund.  The Bank of England are not prepared to assume an obligation of this character.  They are not, as I understand it,convinced that a grave, collapse of the Chinese currency is
 inevitable,  nor that if such a collapse  should occur  the  losses caused to British Banks in China would be  of a really grave order.    The proposal is in their view fundamentally  the  same as that of last July-   The loan now  suggested would  not  however be a direct  loan but an indirect loan, free  of interest to China and with no security beyond the purchasing power of the Chinese dollar when  accounts are finally settled, for it  seems likely that  in the end the fund will  be  left with Chinese dollars instead of sterling.    There  is  very considerable risk involved in  trying to support the Chinese  currency at this time, and moreover in occupied territory where Japan exercises  a very large measure of control.    This risk the  Bank of England feel they cannot  reasonably be  asked to take* 6.&apos;     The scheme therefore,  if it is to proceed, must take the new form suggested in  the Foreign Office memorandum, namely,  that the Government should ask Parliament to  authorise a  guarantee  of  3 millions to the Kong Kong  and Shanghai Bank in order that that Bank may enter into the scheme. 7.      The proposition would be presented  as an effort to support our  financial and  commercial  interests  in China and the Japanese could not,  it is  argued,  justifiably protest against such action.    It appears  to  me however  that this suggested defence for  the operation  is  little more than&apos; a facade.    In the course of discussions  in  the House of  Comuions, must not speeches be  expected stating  that this is  helping China against Japan?    I cannot believe  that  Japan  would be  for a moment deceived by  any suggestion we might make that the loan was not^intended to  be of use to China  in the present  hostilities. As  I  indicated in my note  of  1st July I  am quite unconvinced that  it  is possible  to devise an arrangement which would effectively  prevent  the  Chinese Government making use of any
new credits they receive for general military purposes.   Ifthey are not directly so used then it will he done indirectly&quot;by the release of reserves now kept for hacking of currency.8.     To sum up, before the Cabinet decides to adopt the new proposal, we should squarely face the question whether suchaction is calculated to expose us to risks in the Par east which we are not in a position to deal with.   My own sympathiesare entirely with China in the struggle in which she is engaged,hut it seems to me very important to determine whether thisdeparture from the policy of non-intervention may haveconsequences which we do not intend.   There is the further questions whether so limited an assistance is really going toproduce material results in China&apos;s favour.   As was pointedout last July (when the actual amount of the proposedassistance was considerably larger) there is the practicaldanger that having embarked on this course we may find that what we have done is not effective and that we are pressed to repeat the dose.    Certainly the worst of all policies would beto produce a serious reaction against ourselves withoutachieving any really effective help for China.                           (Intld.) J.S.Treasury Chambers,  S.W.1.,  25th November, 1938.
