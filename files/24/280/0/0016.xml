SECRET.                 CABINET.         Copy No,CP.  261  (38)          SECTION 6  OF THE OFFICIAL                         SECRETS ACT. 1920.Note by the Home Secretary covering Report   of Committee of Heads of Departments.          I circulate the Report of a Committee of Headsof Departments, which was set up with the approval ofthe Prime Minister, to consider whether any amendment ofSection 6 of the Official Secrets Act,  1920, should be recommended.                               S.H.18th November, 1938.(THIS  DOCUMENT IS  THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)
SECRET                       REPORT  OP  COMMITTEE  APPOINTED  TO                    ENQUIRE  INTO  THE  QUESTION  OP  AMENDING                    SECTION  6  OP  THE  OFFICIAL  SECRETS  ACT,                                      1920.3U   Section 6 of the Official Secrets Act, 1920, provides as follows:-          &quot;It shall be the duty of every person to give        on- demand to a chief officer of police, or to a        superintendent or other officer of police not        below the rank of inspector appointed by a chief        officer for the purpose, or to any member of His        Majesty!s forces engaged on guard, sentry, patrol,        or other similar duty, any information in his power        relating to an offence or suspected offence under        the principal Act or this Act, and, if - s.o required,        and upon tender of his reasonable expensesy to attend        at such reasonable time and place as may be specified        for the purpose of furnishing such information, and,        if any person fails to give any such information or        to attend as aforesaid, he.shall be guilty of a        misdemeanour&quot;c2.   The general object of the Official Secrets Acts is to preventunauthorised persons from obtaining, whether as a result of thecorruption or neglect eff public servants or otherwise, confidential information relating to official matters.  The scope of the Acts iswide, and covers not only disclosures which are prejudicial to the safety of the State but any unauthorised disclosure by a person&quot;holding office under His Majesty&quot; (and this phrase includes thepolice) of information which is obtained owing to his officialposition, or unauthorised disclosure by a contractor or his employees of information obtained as a result of a Government contract.  The Actsalso make it an offence for any person knowingly and willingly toreceive prohibited information.3.   In the debates on the Bills for the Official Secrets Acts -see Appendix A - emphasis has been laid on the necessity of safeguarding information of which the disclosure,  would be prejudicial to the safety of the State, but it is, of course, also essential toprevent the disclosure  of official information which neither affectthe safety of the State nor involves state secrets of first-class importance.   It is, for example, essential to safeguard confidential information given in Income-tax returns, and in every GovernmentOffice there are numerous items of information of which the disclosurewould be prejudicial to the interests of private citizens and to theproper conduct of administration.   There have been several prosecutionsof officials or ex-officials for disclosing information obtained in thecourse of their official duties, although the disclosure did not affect the safety of the State nor relate to matters of first-class importance.   For example, an ex Prison Governor was convicted underthe Official Secrets Act for publishing an article of reminiscences in
which he disclosed statements made to him by a condemned man before his execution?  and  a War Office official was convicted for disclosing information to  a business  firm which was useful to them for the purpose of putting in tenders for Government contracts.   While,  however, it is essential to apply the general provisions of the Acts to the disclosure of confidential official information of all kinds, it has for long been recognised that the powers given by Section 6 should be used sparingly and only in special cases.4.   During the  war there was a Defence of the Realm Regulation in force which empowered  a competent authority by Order to require any person tofurnish such information as might be specified in the Order.    Section 6appears to have  &quot;been inserted in the Act of 1920 as a result of the experienceacquired of the  value of this Regulation.     In relation to ordinary criminal offences there is no provision in Englishlav/ subjecting to a penalty persons who refuse to give information.    Thereis  in Scotland, however, power to summon a person before a Sheriff  for examination in regard to any offence which can competently be tried in the sheriff Court.   If a person so summoned fails to appear or refuses to give any information in his power,  he is liable  to a fine of  5 or to imprisonmentnot exceeding 20 days. - See Summary Jurisdiction (Scotland)  Act, 1908,sections 21, 36.     Any person who is believed to have information about an offence or asuspected offence can, of course,  be questioned by the police,  but  he isnot liable to prosecution if he refuses to  give information.     The grounds for the exceptional provision in section 6 are (a) thatthere is often special difficulty in tracing the source of the leakage of official information and discovering the persons through whom that  information has been transmitted;  and (b) that offences against the Official secrets act stand on a special footing and may have so direct and so damaging an effect on the safety of the State or the immediate interests of the Statethat special powers are required for their detention and prevention.5.   Since the section was placed on the Statute Book it appears only tohave been used some half dozen times in England,  and not at all in  Scotland;a note about the cases in which it has been used is given in Appendix B.The cases in which the section has been used do not, however, provide in themselves a measure of its value.   It is  possible to argue from itshistory that the value of the section is not great, and to suggest  that thesection will often be ineffective because if the person interrogated is willing either from public spirit or timidity to help the authority,  hewill give the information without any threat of prosecution under section 6,and if he is a resolute opponent,  he will probably avoid giving any usefulinformation even if the threat of section 6 is used.   The Committee,however, do not take the view that little importance attaches to section 6.The deterrent effect of the section must be borne in mind.    One effect ofthe section is to make it difficult for a person who is trying to get from an official prohibited information to  promise that he will neverdisclose the source of his information, or  at any rate to make it  less likely that an offical will feel confidence in such a
promise.   The existence of the section may also he valuable in caseswhere some person of standing is willing to help the authorities hut feelshimself prevented from doing so because he is in a position of trust and confidence;  for example, a banker, who would usually feel precluded from giving information about the affairs of a client, or an editor, whowould feel that by the ordinary rules of his profession he was prevented from disclosing the source of some piece of information, will be relieved of his scruples if there is a provision on the Statute Book showing that parliament has recognised that in the matter of official secrets theinterests of the State must over-ride other considerations.    Moreover,in espionage cases, the use of drastic powers may be desirable either, forexample, for the purpose of tracking down and recovering some document which is on its way to a foreign power but is still in this country, or  forthe purpose of discovering who are the persons implicated in some act oftreachery.6.   Hitherto the opposition to Section 6 has come mainly fromrepresentatives of the Press.    With a view to meeting their oppositionan undertaking has been given that the Section will only be used with theconsent of the Attorney-General, or, in Scotland, the Lord Advocate, orthe Secretary of State, and such consent will only be given in cases wherethe information disclosed is of serious public importance, - see theMemorandum circulated by the Home Secretary to the Cabinet in April last(CP. 105 (38)).    This undertaking has not satisfied the Press critics,and an agitation is still being conducted for some amending legislation   -which would limit either the general provisions of the Official secrets acts, or, at any rate, the provisions of Section 6, to such official secrets as affect the safety of the State.7.   It appears probable that the agitation against Section 6 based onapprehensions felt by the Press may now be strengthened by apprehensionsfelt by Members of Parliament.    The grounds for keeping certain information secret may, be either that its disclosure would be prejudicial to the interests of the State,  or that its disclosure would be prejudicial.to the interests of a particular Government or a particular Minister.Parliamentary critics of the Section will probably say that it is possiblefor the Executive to use the powers of Section 6 for the second purpose,and that some amendment of the Section is desirable to prevent thepossibility of its misuse by an unscrupulous Executive.8.   The members of the Committee themselves feel that it is right  thatthere should he a discretion vested in the Executive to use the special powers of Section 6 in such cases as the Executive judges proper and would prefer that the general principles of the Section should be retained.   Atthe same time they recognise that it may be necessary or expedient  to make some concession.     They have considered whether any amendment of the Section can  be recommended which would confine- Section 6 to certain classes or types of official secrets.    Clearly a limitation of the Section to cases where the safety of the State is affected would be too narrow - such a limitationv/ould exclude many important Cabinet or Foreign Office secrets - and theCommittee are unable to recommend any amendment limiting the Section to a specific class of offence.   Any form of words devised for the purpose would be unsatisfactory and would be liable to exclude cases in which theuse of such powers of interrogation might be important.    Moreover,  ifSection 6 were limited to certain specially important types  of official secrets, it would probably lead to a demand that the general provisionsof the Official Secrets Act should be similarly limited.9-   In these circumstances it seems to us  that if Ministers decide  it isnecessary to make a concession,  the best practicable  plan would be  to
S   amend the Section so as to require the prior consent  of  sore  judicialS   authority to the exercise of the powers of interrogation under Section 6.   There are objections to this course,  partly because the  considerations   which should guide a decision on this question are executive  rather than   judicial considerations, and partly because an application to a  judicial   authority necessarily involves some delay.    This question of delay was   viewed with some concern by the Services representatives and  the Director   of Public Prosecutions in connection  with espionage cases  in  which urgent   action by way of interrogation might  be required.   It was, however,   recognised that the difficulties mentioned in the preceding paragraph might   be considered to be applicable to excepting from the  necessity cf some   prior consent particular cases c.  urgency.    We have  therefore ccme to the   conclusion that despite the objections above-mentioned - if a concession   must be made to Parliamentary criticism - an amendment requiring a judicial   authorisation is the least objectionable course.        On the question which is an appropriate judicial authority for this   purpose we should say the Chief Magistrate at Bow Street was  the most   appropriate authority, if all the cases could be dealt with in London.   This, however, is not practicable, and we do not feel that in the provinces   it would be suitable to place this responsibility on  a Stipendiary Magistrate j  or on two or more lay Justices.   On  the whole, therefore, we think the bestI  plan would be, if there must be judicial authorisation,  to require theI   consent in Chambers of a Judge of the High Court.   There  is  a precedentI   for such an arrangement in the provisions of Section  2(2)  of  the Incitement   to Disaffection Act, 1934,relating to search warrants.   10.  It would be desirable to give some guidance to the  Judge as to the   circumstances in which consent should be given or refused  and though, for   the reasons given in paragraph 8, we  do not think Section  6 could be limited   to classes or types of official secrets,  we think it  would be practicable   to provide that the Judge, before granting consent, roust be satisfied that   the offence or suspected offence relates to matters of serious importance,   their seriousness being measured by their relation to the  safety of the   State or the general public interest.    We recognise  that, in the event of a   Bill being introduced by the Government,  amendments might &quot;be  moved to   restrict Section 6 still further, but we should assume that any such   amendments would be resisted.I   11.  We have prepared and attach as Appendix C to the Report, a draft Bill&apos;   to give effect to the foregoing plan.        In addition to introducing the major amendment requiring a Judge to he   satisfied that there is a case for the exercise of the powers of   interrogation, the draft Bill effects certain minor amendments of the   existing Sections        (l)   The reference in the existing Section to &quot;any member of His   Majesty&apos;a Forces engaged on sentry, patrol  or other similar duty&quot; has been   omitted.        (2)   The Section at present provides that the powers  of  interrogation   shall be exerciseable &quot;by &quot;a Chief Officer of Police or a Superintendent or   other officer of police not below the rank of Inspector  appointed by the   Chief Officer of Police for the purpose&quot;.    Section 12 of the Official   Secrets Act, 1911, also provides that the expression  ^Superintendent of   Police&quot; ,  includes &quot;any person upon whom the powers of a Superintendent of   Police are for the purpose of this Act conferred by a Secretary of State&quot;.   These words were inserted in order to cover cases where interrogations are   conducted by officers of M.I.5.    In  the  amending draft Bill we have   contemplated the responsibility for c.:?tion  under the  section as lying upon   the Director of Public Prosecutions or upon a Chief Officer of police, by
18th November, 1938.enabling one or other of these authorities to make an application to  the judge.   The person named in the warrant as authorised to conduct theinterrogation would in many cases he a police officer but might well* inan appropriate case, be an officer of M.I.5.     (3)  The existing provisions of Section 6 are not clear as to theposition of a person who under interrogation wilfully gives  falseinformation.   The amending Bill clarifies this point.12.  We have considered whether, if Section 6 were amended as proposed inthe draft Bill, it would be desirable to make any amendment  of theprovision which requires the consent of the Attorney-General to a prosecution under the Official Secrets Acts.    On the whole, however, wethink it is undesirable to make any such alteration,  partly  becausecircumstances might well arise where, after an interrogation had  been authorised by a judicial authority, it might  be found desirable not t^take proceedings for failure to give information,  and partly because  froma Parliamentary point of view it appears to be desirable  that any amending legislation should be confined to Section 6 of the Act of 1920, so as to exclude proposals for general amendments of the Official  Secrets  Acts.13.  We attach in Appendix D a note on a Private Member&apos;s Bill which was introduced last session for the purpose of amending Section  6.                              (Signed)    A. MAXWELL.                                           Chairman,                &apos;            on behalf of the Committee.
APPENDIX   A.          Clause 2 of the Bill for the Official Secrets Act, 1889,originally read as follows:-          &quot;Where a person by means of his holding or having        held an office under Her Majesty has lawfully or        unlawfully................ acquired any information and        at any time wilfully communicates..............that        information to any person to whom the same ought not,        according to the rules of the office or in the interests        of the State to he communicated at that time, he shall        he guilty&quot; of a misdemeanour.          The Second Reading of the Bill was moved by the attorney general (sir Richard Webster) in a speech of three sentences sayingthat the Bill had been prepared under the direction of the Secretaryof State for War and the First Lord of the Admiralty &quot;in order topunish the offence of obtaining information and communicating itagainst the interests of the State&quot;.          On the Third Reading Dr0 Cameron moved the re-committalof the Bill, pointing out that &quot;if any official should give information on certain&apos;&apos;subjects to members of this House, he would bring himselfunder the Act because the very giving of the information would be against the rules of the office&quot;.   He said he understood the attorney-General was prepared to&apos; modify the Bill to meet this point.          The Bill was re-committed and the Clause amended so as to relate only to the communication of  information &quot;to persons to whomthe same ought not in the interests of the State or of any Departmentof the Government or otherwise in the public interest to becommunicated&quot;.          On the Third Reading the words &quot;or of any Department of theGovernment&quot; were challenged, Mr0  Haribury pointing out that &quot;a good manyDepartments will not be kept in that good order they ought to be inif we do not obtain more information about them in the future than wehave been able to obtain in the past and are not able at once to putour finger on the blot&quot;.          The Attorney-General said the words were inserted &quot;to meetspecific cases, and one of the cases is known to me.   When it wasdecided to adopt a new system of guns the fact was made known verymuch to the detriment of the War Department who had to pay largerprices for the new pattern than they would otherwise have had to pay&quot;.He agreed, however, that such cases would be covered by the words &quot;inthe interests of the State&quot; and consented to the omission of the words&quot;or of any Department of the Government&quot;.
          It is interesting to note that one speaker (S.ir G. Campbell),the member, far Kirkcaldy, said &quot;I venture to say the Bill will be of no practical use until the Government have the courage to go further  andpunish not only those who steal information, but the receivers of thestolen goods - the newspapers.  Until the Government deal with thepress nothing in connection with this matter will be satisfactory.Instead of attacking the poor clerk, the Government should go further and attack the real offenders, the people who obtain secrets andpublish them for profit&quot;.          By the Bill of 1911 the provision making it an offence tocommunicate information to any person to whom such information ought not  &quot;in the interests of the State&quot; to be communicated, was enlargedso as to make it an offence to communicate information &quot;to any person other than the person to whom he is authorised to communicate it, or aperson to whom it is in the interests of the State his duty tocommunicate it&quot;.   The Bill of 19ll was introduced by Lord Haldane as secretary of State for War.  He said the Bill had been underconsideration for a long time by the Defence Committee and that it is&quot;their work arrived at after consultation with the naval and militaryauthorities and&apos;with the legal advisers of the Crown&quot;.  His speechrelated entirely to the need of strengthening the law for the purposeof the protection of naval and military secrets.  In the House ofCommons the Bill passed through all its stages in the last week ofthe session with very little discussion;   there was no discussion at all on the Clause making it an offence for an official tocommunicate information to any person &quot;other than a person to whom he is authorised to communicate it&quot;.          In the same way the case for the Bill of 1920 was basedmainly on the need for strengthening the law for the purpose ofsecuring the safety of the State.   The Attorney-General of the day,Sir Gordon Hewart,  emphasised the point that the main object of theBill was to deal with espionage.
A P F E N D I X_B.          So far as can be ascertained there have been only six cases  inwhich use is known to have been made of the provisions of section 6.     (l)  In 1936 plans of a submarine were improperly removed fromofficial custody, and a man named Goode who had taken these prints to  aphotographer for the purpose of obtaining copies was interrogated undersection 6.   He declined to make any statement and was prosecuted.   Theproceedings failed because the Judge held that the Superintendent had  notbeen specially appointed by the Chief Officer of Police for the specificpurpose of interrogating Goode.     (2)  Associated with Goode was a man called Pounds.    He  also wasinterrogated under section 6;  he professed ignorance.   It was not considered possible to prove that he had failed to give information and noproceedings were taken against him.     (3)  In 1927 some information was published in various newspapersabout the formation of a &quot;flying squad&quot; at Scotland Yard.    The editors ofvarious newspapers were interrogated and it was found that there had been no leakage.   Some journalist had accidentally guessed what developmentswere in progress and had written a paragraph about it and the  other papershad based their articles on this original guess.     (4-)  In 1930 a Lobby Correspondent published a statement  that theGovernment had decided to arrest Ghandi.    It was thought that there hadbeen a leakage.   The powers of section 6 were used and it was found thatthere had been no leakage:  the Lobby Correspondent had made an intelligentguess.     (5)  In 1937 a German arrived at Harwich and documents in his possession indicated that he was a spy and had agents in this  country.Some of the agents whose names appeared in the German&apos;s notes  were subjected to interrogation under section 6.   The interrogations did not provide sufficient evidence to enable the German to be prosecuted but  he was deported.
      (6)  In 1937 the &quot;Daily Dispatch&quot; published a reproduction of a confidential police circular by the Chief Constable of Southport for thepurpose of securing the arrest of a man wanted for fraud.    The ManagingEditor of the &quot;Daily Dispatch&quot; was interrogated under section 6 andsupplied the name of the writer under protest.   The writer of the articlewas interrogated and refused to give information.    He was prosecuted andfined  5.

Official  Secrets.           DRAFT              OF A        BILLTo amend section six of the Official        Secrets Act, 1920.CCCLXXXVIII B.  (2.)22nd October 1938;30-1
APPENDIX    D.             Notes  on  the Bill introduced by Mr. Foot.          Mr. Poofs Bill limits the use of Section 6 to oases where &quot;there  are  reasonable  grounds for believing that such information relates to matters  affecting the safety of  the  State&quot;.   Such a limitation would exclude many Cabinet secrets and Foreign Office secrets and could not be accepted.          As Sub-section (3) of Clause  1  of Mr. Foofs Bill is drawn  it would require the Prosecution to prove  in Court to a jury that &quot;there are reasonable  grounds  for believing that such information relates to matters affecting the  safety of the State&quot;.   This means that it would be necessary to disclose  to the jury not only the particular item of information which has  been betrayed, but also much other secret information to prove what is the effect of disclosure on &quot;the safety of the State&quot;.    Clearly these are not matters which ought to be argued before  a jury.          Clause 1(3)  contains a provision that no person shall he bound to answer any question if the answer would have a tendency to expose him to a  criminal charge.   Such a provision would make Section 6 useless, since it is an offence to receive prohibited information, and, therefore, under Clause 1(3), no  questions could be addressed to the recipient of prohibited  information.   This provision is no doubt based on a mistaken idea  that Section 6 can be used in  such a way as to force a person interrogated to give information which could be used against him if he himself were placed in the dock.   No information, however, given by a  person interrogated under the provisions of Section 6 could be used as evidence against him in a prosecution because, under the ordinary rules of , evidence, an  incriminating statement made by a defendant ean onlybe used against him if it is entirely voluntary.          No doubt there might be cases in which as the result of an interrogation under Section 6 the person so interrogated might subsequentlybecome the subject of a criminal charge.  For example,  if the person interrogated says a  certain official gave him the information and the official so named then admits that he gave the information and adds that he had received a bribe from the recipient of the information,  the recipient of the information might be prosecuted for bribing the official if there were evidence available against him independently of any statement which he himself had made when interrogated under Section 6, Generally speaking,  however, a person interrogated under Section 6 wouldbe unlikely himself to be the subject of a criminal charge.   The main object of the Section is to obtain information to assist the authorities to take action against some other person.
