THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  November 1938.SECRET.Copy No.CP. 267 (38).TO BE  KEPT  UNDER LOCK AND  KEY.It  is  requested  that  special care  may  be taken  to      ensure  the  secrecy of  this  document.CABINET.ABYSSINIAN  FRONTIERS.      [With Three Maps.]Joint Memorandum by  the  Secretaries of State for Foreign Affairs  and the                                  Colonies.     THE coming into force of the Anglo-Italian Agreement will necessitate theopening of negotiations with  the  Italian Government  for the delimitation ofthe frontiers between Italian East Africa on the one hand, and the Sudan, kenya and British Somaliland on the other hand.  The  purpose of this memorandum isto seek authority  to ask the Italian Government to grant us  certain territorialconcessions on the  frontiers of  Italian  East  Africa,  and  to indicate  whatcompensation might be offered to  the Italians in  return for  these  concessions.For the purposes  of the Abyssinia-Sudan frontier, it will be necessary for theEgyptian Government to be associated with these negotiations, and steps are beingtaken to obtain the concurrence of the Egyptian Government to our proposals.     2.  The frontiers between the  Sudan,  Kenya and British Somaliland on theone  hand and Italian East Africa on the other hand  are very unsatisfactory.In some areas they cut across tribal boundaries, and in others they are necessarilycrossed, at certain seasons of the year, by  large numbers of tribesmen who haveto migrate in order to  obtain  grazing and water for their herds.   In each ofthese cases effective administration of the tribes by the authorities on either sideof the frontier is very  difficult.  On the one hand, the tribes  are unwilling torecognise what they regard as artificial barriers erected across their lands, andon the other hand they  are in some cases very ready to  take advantage. of  their freedom from the control of the authxarjjtigs during the periods when they arebeyond  the  frontier7&apos; &quot;Moreover,&apos; these seasonal migrations have always been a constant source of disputes between hostile tribes which have frequently led tofeuds and bloodshed.  This state of affairs was a fruitful cause of friction withthe Abyssinian authorities in the past.  In the interests, therefore, not only of theeffective4 administration of these frontier regions, but also of the preservation ofgood neighbourly relations with the Italian authorities,  it is very desirable thatthese artificial boundaries  should be rectified on  more  logical and  scientificprinciples.     3.   More detailed particulars of the situation on these frontiers and of our proposals for rectifying them  are  given in Appendices I, II  and III  and areillustrated on the maps A, B and C annexed thereto.  A summary of our proposal is given in paragraphs 4, 5, 6 and 7 below.10139   [18254]B
                   The Sudan-Abyssinia Frontier (Map A).    4.  It is proposed to ask the Italian Government to surrender the BaroSalient, between Gambeila and the present frontier traversed by the River Baro,in exchange for the Ilembi Triangle, where  the present  frontiers of Kenya,Ethiopia and the Sudan meet (less the Turkana grazing grounds, which  are nowto be  attributed to Kenya -these grounds form the area on the annexed Map Aimmediately to the north of the previous straight line Kenya-Sudan frontier, andhave  recently been surveyed  by a joint Sudan-Kenya Commission).   The BaroSalient and Ilembi Triangle  are roughly equal in area -about 6,000 square mileseach.   However, it is possible that the Italian Government will maintain  that theBaro  Salient is a  more important cession of territory than  the Ilembi Triangle,and will, in addition, ask for transit facilities through the  Sudan.        The Abyssinia-Kenya Frontier, East of Lake Rudolf (Map B).    5. &apos;(a) In consideration  for the rectification of the frontier desired by Kenyain the Moyale-Gaddaduma. sector, it is proposed to cede to the Italians the areasmarked A  and B,  and if necessary the area marked C, on Map B.  The cession of these areas would not involve the  transfer of any British subjects.    (b) As part  of the  price for  a  satisfactory settlement on  the  british somali land frontiers, it is also proposed  to grant the Italians transit facilitiesalong the Kenya section of the Kismayu-Moyale road.  If, however, the  Italianswish  this  road to be  constructed to an  all-weather  standard, it is proposed,according to circumstances,  either to offer to make a 50 per cent, contribution from  the  British  Treasury  towards  the  cost  of  building  this road (the totalcost is  estimated  tentatively at  65,000).  or to agree  to build the road if  theItalians are prepared  to bear the capital cost.  In any event, it is proposed tostipulate that  the road should not  be used for  military traffic, and  that  theItalians should make a substantial contribution towards the maintenance of theroad.    (c) While, for the reasons explained  in paragraph 11 of Appendix  II, itis hoped that it will not be  necessary to cede the area marked f) on Map B, itmay be necessary to reconsider this question when  we receive the Italian counter-proposals.                  The British Somaliland Frontiers (Map C).A- Southern Frontier.    6.  It is proposed to ask  the Italians to agree to a rectification of the Southernfrontier of British  Somaliland so as to take  into the  Protectorate the  grazingareas  of the British tribes up to the limits agreed upon by the Anglo-AbyssinianBoundary  Commission  of 1935, subject to two modifications: -    (a) At the Eastern end  of the frontier, as it is unlikely that the  Italians           would  agree to  the   transfer of  Walwal and Wardair  and  the/r :        immediately surrounding area, it  will be necessary tp  aim at  a           boundary coinciding with the limits  of  grazing  recognised in  the        .   Rome Agreement  of January 1937 (Cmd. 5775);  and . .  (6) At the Western end of the frontier, as the grazing areas recognised byo;i!        the Boundary  Commission of  1.935 and in the  Pome Agreement of  ; ;        1937 extend to the  west of the Jibuti  Railway,,  and as it is  assumed           that the Italians  would not countenance the transfer of any territory   r      - to the west of, or abutting on, this Railway, it is not proposed to ask           that this part of the grazing area  should be included in British           Somaliland. It is suggested therefore that in this area the  frontier           should  follow the existing frontier from the tri-junction point with;iErench Somaliland to  Samadu at the south-western corner of British!.:-:.:.       Somaliland, extending from that place to Gialdessa and then  running ;f::.        eastwards along the limit of the grazing areas as already indicated.    The area which we. hope to obtain is coloured blue on  Map  C,  and the line from  Samadu to Gialdessa is shown  in red.
B. Eastern Frontier,    It is proposed to ask the Italians to agree that the Boundary demarcated bythe Anglo-Italian Boundary  Commission of 1929-30 should be confirmed by theBritish and Italian Governments, and that it should be agreed that British andItalian tribes should be free to cross the boundary on a basis of reciprocity up tothe limits of the grazing areas  recognised by the  Boundary Commission.  the grazing areas of the  British tribes are hatched in green on Map  &quot; C.&quot;  Thearrangements to be.made for British and Italian tribesmen to cross the frontiershould be the subject of negotiation; and provided that a satisfactory agreement isreached, the Italians would be informed that His Majesty&apos;s Government would beprepared to accept the boundary line proposed by the Italian Commissioner in theneighbourhood of Banda Ziada, with regard to which the  Boundary Commissionfound  it impossible to reach agreement.    7.  It may be assumed that  the Italians  will not  readily accede  to ourdemands in respect of the Southern Frontier of  British Somaliland.   As an inducement towards acceptance of these demands or as concessions towards Italiancounter-demands, it is suggested that we should     (1) In addition to making our  offer of the Italian line  at Banda Ziada, agree           to confirmation of the Eastern Frontier Boundary as a closed frontier,           i.e.,  without provision for grazing facilities in Italian territory for           our  tribes.    (2) Offer the Italians a permanent Transit Traffic Agreement in place of the           two years&apos; Agreement which is  due to expire at the end of February           1939&quot;and meet such Italian desiderata for the improvement of  transit           facilities as may appear acceptable.    (3) Offer to withdraw, in favour of the Italians, from  an area on the Eastern           Frontier.  The limits of this area are under discussion, but  it would           not be less than the area bounded by a straight line from the frontier           to  Buran  (excluding  Buran), thence by a straight line to  Taleh           (including Taleh), thence due east to the  frontier.  This area, coloured           red  on Map C,  is about 2,088 square miles in  extent.  It consists of           seasonal grazing grounds and no  British-Protected  Persons are           permanently domiciled in it.    (4) If the three previous concessions should prove insufficient, offer to share           the  cost of the transit traffic roads  from Berbera and Zeila to the           frontier up to a maximum of 50 per cent, of  the capital and maih-           tenance.  This concession  might involve the Somaliland Government           in  expenditure  of  between   50,000  or    100,000;   and,  as  the           Protectorate is  a grant-aided territory,  the burden would have to be           borne by the United  Kingdom Exchequer.    (5) If necessary, also offer the  Italians a transit agreement for the use of the           Kismayu-Moyale road  in  Kenya and for a financial contribution in           connection  therewith (see  preceding  paragraph 5).    (6) In the last resort, offer  the Italians  the area marked D on Map B and           referred to in the preceding paragraph 5.    Should the Italians, despite all these concessions, refuse to cede the territory which we want on the  Southern Frontier, it will be necessary to fall back on the much less satisfactory expedient of converting the existing  Grazing Rights Agree-ment into a permanent arrangement, and to this end it would be essential to makethe present Transit Traffic Agreement more attractive to  the Italians.  Both the grazing Rights and Transit Traffic  Agreements lapse at the  end  of February1939,  and the Italian authorities have intimated that, unless the Transit TrafficAgreement can be made to operate more satisfactorily, they will be disposed to terminate *both Agreements,    The termination  of  the Grazing Rights Agreement  without  any provisionfor the future  for  safeguarding the  grazing and watering rights (acquired by treaty with Ethiopia) of our tribesmen would be a  calamity for Somaliland, andin order to avert it, it might prove advisable to put forward the offers outlined in sections (2) and (4) of this paragraph, even though there  should be no possi-bility of securing a cession of territory  in exchange.

    8.  Although we have summarised our proposals separately in  relation tothe various British territories concerned, it is to be anticipated that, from thepoint of view of satisfying Italian public opinion, it will be necessary for theItalian Government  to strike  a balance between what they  cede,  and  theadvantages which they receive in return, over the whole field of these negotiations,and we have kept this point in mind in formulating our proposals.    An attempt has been made to anticipate the requests that are likely to be putforward by the Italians in the course of these negotiations, and  our  conclusions on this aspect of the matter are set out in paragraphs 7 and 9-13 of Appendix II,and paragraphs 10-15 of Appendix III.                               /&apos;                                                                  - M*. M.    November 25, 1938.
5255APPENDIX I.                        SUDAN-ETHIOPIAN FRONTIER.    THE southern part of the frontier between the Sudan and  Italian EastAfrica (or previously Ethiopia) has never been demarcated south of Jokau, andit has long been recognised that the undemarcated part of the frontier south ofJokau as provisionally administered hitherto, as well as the  southernmost partof the demarcated frontier  from Jebel Gemi (latitude 9D North) to Jokau, is most unsatisfactory in many ways.   It ignores all physical and ethnographical features.It parts company from the  escarpment of the Ethiopian  table-land and,  byfollowing the Baro, Pibor and Akobo rivers, constitutes a salient projecting intothe Sudan.  In  this way it runs through country which is low-lying and, to agreat extent, swamped during the rainy season.   Its chief disadvantage, however,is that it divides the areas inhabited by the Nilotic continuer and Anuak tribes, whichin colour, race and  customs, are entirely distinct from the tribes inhabiting  the ethiopian table-land  further  east. These two  Nilotic tribes are really  Sudannatives and have their centres of  Government in the Sudan  and in the portionof Nilotic swamped lands now shown on the map as being in Italian East Africa.The continuer tribe,  moreover, live for  the greater part of the year in the  Sudan andare protected by the Sudan Government.  As long, however, as the present frontieris maintained, the effect is that one small section of this tribe live in Italian EastAfrica and other sections cross over into  that territory for grazing and wateringduring the dry season, which lasts  roughly from  November to  April of each year.    2.  A further problem is presented by the Anuak tribe, which occupies a beltof territory immediately to the south and east of that occupied by  the continuer.About half the Anuak (the Ohirru and the Adonga section) live,-as the frontieris now observed, permanently  in the Sudan on the west bank of the river  Akoboand Pibor and south of Akobo post; but many of their relatives live on the riversBaro and Gila.  This state of  things has in the past caused much administrativeinconvenience and even bloodshed.    3.  So far as the continuer are concerned, the effective control of the whole tribeby the  Sudan Government is essential to any orderly administration of  the  regionin question and  is in the best interests of the tribesmen themselves.  Such controlcan only be secured by means of a modification of the frontier, which would bringthe whole continuer tribal grazing  grounds within Sudan territory.  At the same timethe cession of the whole of the Anuak  to the Sudan should be effected.  Anyfrontier  drawn  through the Baro  salient itself would have the effect of cuttingthrough a tribal area and would hence be open to the same objection as the presentfrontier.  The  only really  logical and practical boundary would  be  one  which followed the western base of the Abyssinian escarpment and hence gave the wholeof the  Baro salient  to the Sudan.    4.   The Italian Government may be willing to agree to this cession providedthat they are adequately compensated  elsewhere, and that regard is  had  to  theposition which  they have already built up at Gambeila, where they have erectedbuildings and other structures of a permanent or semi-permanent character.   Itwould be preferable that the new frontier should run to the east of Gambeila,  butif, as is  probable, this cannot be obtained, it is proposed that the  new frontiershould run  through  Gambeila itself,  leaving  on the Italian side the formerAbyssinian customs station, which  is now in the hands of the Italians,  and on theSudan side  the  Sudan trading station, which is at present administered as  anenclave by the Sudan  authorities.    5.  As regards compensation for the cession of the Baro salient, it is proposedthat the  Italian Government shall be offered in return for this a block of  Sudanterritory lying immediately to the south of this salient and roughly equal to it inarea (6,000 square miles).  This could be effected if the new frontier, crossing theold frontier at Ilembi, continued,  generally speaking,. to follow the base  of  theescarpment,  leaving on the Italian side the Boma plateau and,  generally speaking,
all the area inhabited by the &apos;&apos; hills &apos;&apos; Murle (Beir) tribe.  The proposal can bemore  clearly understood  by reference to  the  attached  map where the proposed changes have been marked.    6.  The territory which it is proposed to offer to Italy in exchange for theBaro salient is largely unadministered by the Sudan authorities, and is used as the seasonal grazing grounds by tribes coming from the Italian side of the presentfrontier.  The whole  proposal is designed to facilitate the  administration of italian East Africa and the Sudan respectively by including in the territoriesbf each State areas used for seasonal grazing by tribes normally resident in andsubject to that State./
APPENDIX  II.            KENYA-ABYSSINIAN FRONTIER (EAST OF LAKE RUDOLF).    THE only description of this  frontier which  has been embodied ip any formal international agreement is that contained in the Anglo-Ethiopian Agree-ment  of  the 6th December, 1907 (Cd. 4318).   This  description of the  frontier,which is marked on the annexed map (B), was drawn up as a result of  a surveyrnade by Captain  F.  Maud, R.E., who was a member of an expedition under mr. A. Butter, which visited  the frontier region in  1902.  This expedition wasalso accompanied by Count Colli of the Italian Legation at Addis Ababa.  Thirboundary was not regarded as definitive since it was provided in the agreement that Commissioners should be appointed by both of  the Governments concerned to delimit the exact line of the  frontier, and in particular to settle the frontier of the Borana and the  Gurre in concert with the heads of those tribes and inaccordance with their customs.    2.  In spite, however,  of repeated representations by His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment, it was never found possible to induce the Emperor of Abyssinia to appointCommissioners for this purpose  and the frontier has consequently never been thesubject of an  agreed  delimitation.    3.  When the administration of the northern  frontier region of Kenyawas begun it was fqund that the line drawn by Captain Maud was most unsuitablein several respects.   It lies tangentially along the southern extremities of thespurs of the Borana escarpment, and thus excludes from British territory almost all the permanent water,  which lies at the heads of  the valleys.  At certainseasons of  the year,  the wells and grazing grounds south of  this line dry up and  it is then necessary for  the tribes to move into the valleys  north of the&quot;Treaty&quot;  line, in order to obtain water  and grazing for their  stock. Whileit is  true that provision for  these seasonal trans-frontier movements had beenmade in the Agreement of 1907, their occurrence has always rendered the adminis-tration  of  this area  extremely  difficult.  They have been a constant  source of disputes and bloodshed between  the turbulent tribes in that area, and of disputeswith  the Ethiopian authorities.V   4.  In 1908 a  Commission under Major C.  W.  Gwynn,  R.E., was sent toAddis Ababa  with a  view  to undertaking, jointly with members to be appointedby the Emperor, the agreed  delimitation of  the frontier as provided in theAgreement in 1907.  After waiting in vain for some  months for the  appoint -ment  of the Abyssinian  members of the Commission, Major Gwynn and his party were  authorised to proceed to the frontier  alone.  He  found that  there was no permanent water on  the British side of the Treaty  line for some 100 miles tothe East and  some 130 miles to the West of Moyale,  and he formed the&apos;definiteopinion that  the principles on which Captain Maud  had proceeded, in drawingthe line  proposed  by him  in  1902, were incorrect, probably as a  result of hisignorance of  the necessity for  the northwards migration of the  Kenya tribesduring the dry seasons.  Major Gwynn  therefore  proceeded to survey a newline (hereinafter referred to as the &apos;&apos; Gywnn line &quot;) which is also marked on the annexed map, which  by leaving some permanent water on the British  side was intended to avoid  the administrative difficulties of the Treaty line, in the  area east  and West of Moyale.  He also proposed various other modifications of theTreaty line^which it  is unnecessary to mention here.    5.  In the light of  subsequent  experience in  the administration of  thisterritory it became apparent that, although the Gwynn line, in the Moyale area,would be a great improvement  over the Treaty line, it would  itself be unsatis-factqry since  it would leave, on the British side, barely sufficient water to  make possible the administration of the area, and it would still leave the greater  partof the customary dry season wells and grazing grounds of the Kenya tribes onthe Abyssinian side of  the frontier.  Further investigation has shown that theessential requirements of the Kenya tribes would be met,  and the necessity for
 seasonal trans-frontier migrations would be avoided  by a modification  of  the Gwynn line, as shown by the red line on the annexed map.  The Government of Kenya is  satisfied that this adjustment of the  frontier would leave  sufficient permanent water for the use of the tribes residing  to  the North of this line. Moreover, by  this rectification,  the  Italian administration,  equally with  the British administration, would be relieved of the difficulties which are inherent in the existing situation arising from the interposition of the  frontier line between the wet  and dry season grazing grounds of the tribes which inhabit this area. &apos;;  &apos;  6.  The effect of the adjustment of this section of the frontier,  as suggested, would be to transfer to Kenya a small area of territory,  together with a certain number of tribesmen who reside there.  It is proposed, in exchange, if necessary to cede to Italy the areas marked A,  B,  and C on  Map B, in that  order of preference.  The cession of the areas  A and B would confer on the Italian administration advantages  similar  to  those that  we hope  to  acquire by  the rectification of the boundary in the Moyale area.   Area A includes the southern portion of the wet season  grazing of the  Gurre Huruffi from the Gullgullo district of Abyssinia,  and, moreover, this section of the  Gwynn line  would  provide  an easily recognisable frontier a matter of difficulty in a featureless  area.  The acquisition of area B would provide the Italian administration with a permanent lateral line of  communication by means of the track through Bahal, Malka Ade and Dakka Dima to El Der.  Moreover, the best well in this area, namely,  Eil Roba, would also then be  in Italian territory.                        ,     7.  The cession of area C would to some extent serve the same purpose, as the  shores of Lake Rudolf  are  visited periodically by tribesmen living  to  the north of the Treaty line.  It is, however, understood that the Italians are very anxious to acquire this area for  quite another reason, viz.,  in order to give them access to deep  water on Lake Rudolf, thus enabling them to establish a seaplane base there. For this reason, and also because of  the value of  Lake Rudolf as a source of water supply in military operations, the Service Departments consider that this area  should not be ceded to Italy unless  it is  otherwise impossible to secure the rectification  of   the  frontier  desired  by Kenya  in the  Moyale- Gaddaduma section.   It  is,  however,  our considered opinion that the cession of the  areas  A and B would  be insufficient  for this purpose,  and  that it will accordingly be necessary to contemplate the cession of area  C.     8. The cession of areas A and C would not involve the  transfer of any British subjects, as there is no permanent British population in  these areas.  They are  used  solely by tribesmen living  to  the north of the frontier as wet season grazing grounds.  In the area B, however, there are a  few permanent but incon- siderable wells, and a small  British population, of whom, however,  the majority normally move to the Gaddaduma area  in the dry season.  In a bad dry season practically all  the population have to leave this area.   The transfer of this area to Italy would therefore only affect a very small number of tribesmen, who could;easily be accommodated in the Gaddaduma area which, ex hypothesi, we  should get if  we surrender this area. The transfer would, in fact, be to the advantage ofthese natives.,.,j;   9. In addition to the desire of the Italians to acquire the area on the Eastern shore  of Lake  Rudolf (v. paragraph  7 above), there have been clear indications that the Italians are also likely to ask for the cession of that part of Jubaland, in.&apos; the North-eastern region  of Kenya, which they wished to acquire, and which we;declined to cede to them,  as part of the  bargain in respect of the distribution of colonial territories at the end of the  last war.  It appears that  the Italians  are anxious  to develop a  further line of communication  with Southern Abyssiniathrough the port of Kismayu, and thence along the road which enters Kenya on its,Fmstern frontier at Dif, and then proceeds North-westwards through Moyale; andit is therefore probable that  they will ask for the cession  of an area which would include this road.  There are, however,  many objections  (strategic and adminis- trative, apart from the more general objections) to the cession of such a large area, put after consultation with the Government of Kenya, it would  appear that  the-area marked D on Map  B might be ceded to Italy without giving rise to any/serious strategic or administrative objections.  In fact, from the administrative point  of view the cession of this area would have some advantage in creating a
frontier which is  readily recognisable, and  across which there  are  no seasonalmigrations.   Moreover, the  population of this area belong to the same tribes asthe population north of the Daua River, so that the whole of these tribes wouldbe brought under one administration.     10.  We did  not think it necessary to consider  the cession of this-area inconnection with the rectification of the Northern frontier of Kenya, as the cession of the areas A, B and C ought to be  sufficient compensation to  the Italians forthat rectification.   In the case  of the Somaliland frontiers, on  the  other hand,(vide Appendix III) we shall be asking for a very large accretion of territory, andwe have very little to offer the Italians in return.  We  therefore considered thepossible cession of area D&apos;in Kenya as part of the bargain in respect of what we want for Somaliland.     11.  On reflection, however, the Secretary of State  for the Colonies wouldbe very unwilling to have to agree to  the cession of this area, for the  following reasons : 1     (a) The objections (Parliamentary and other) to  agreeing to the cession of a           part of a British  Colony which would probably  involve the transfer           with it of some  five  thousand British subjects.     (b) The  fact  that it would not be possible to consult these tribesmen until           after an  agreement had been reached with the Italians for the cession           of their land.     (c) The element of doubt (though admittedly slight)  whether they would elect           to become  Italian subjects and  remain in the transferred area, or           whether they would wish to move into another area of Kenya where it           would  be very difficult, if  not impossible, to find accommodation for           them.     (d) The fact  that it might  be decided not to defend Somaliland in war.     (e) The doubt whether  even the cession of this area  of Kenya would, in fact,           be a sufficient  inducement to  the Italians  to agree to  the desired           rectification of the Somaliland frontier.  If this were found not to be           the case, we should then be in a worse position than we are at present,           in that we should have disclosed to the Italians the fact that we have           no absolutely insuperable objection to the cession of the north-eastern           corner of Kenya, which  the Italians had coveted at the time of the           cession of Jubaland.     It may,  however, be necessary  to reconsider the question of the  cession ofthis area when we have received the  counter-proposals of the Italian Government.     12.  Having  regard to the indications  that the Italians have in mind thedevelopment of the  Kismayu-Mpyale  route, we  have also considered whether itwould be worth while offering to improve that route so as to make it suitable formoderately heavy  traffic throughout  the year.  The section from Wajir  to Moyaleis in fairly good condition, though it  is not  an all-weather route, but the sectionfrom Wajir  to Dif  is practically non-existent, and it is estimated that it would cost at least  65,000 to construct the Kenya section of this road to an all-Weatherstandard.  This estimate  is  based  on the assumption  that the work could becarried out for  200 per mile, with provision for contingencies of  5,000.  Thestandard of construction contemplated would not be high, and if the traffic were at all  heavy, the annual maintenance  charges would be  considerable.   As Kenyawould not wish to undertake this work for its own purposes, and as the construc-tion of this road would be part of the bargain in respect of Somaliland, it wouldnot be reasonable to expect Kenya to bear any part of the cost of construction.  If,however, it should appear, in the course of the negotiations, that the  constructionof this road  would materially assist us in obtaining  a satisfactory settlement on-the Somaliland frontier, it is suggested that it would  be reasonable  (as in thecase of the roads in  Somaliland v.  Appendix III, paragraph 14) to offer to.contribute half the  cost from the British Treasury, if the  Italians would bear the other half.  This offer would, of course, not be made unless  it were likely toproduce commensurate advantages.   If, nevertheless, the Italians should desiretransit facilities along this route, and if they wanted something better than theexisting road, we, might offer to construct it to an all-weather standard if theywere prepared to; pay for  it.  In  either case it is thought that it  should be       [18254]  *  . .  &apos;                                   ^           -  c  &apos;
stipulated that  the Italians should  contribute  substantially to  the cost ofmaintenance, which would be very heavy if the road were used to any considerable extent.              ^     13.   The construction of this road would assist  an Italian advance  intoKenya to a certain extent, though this consideration is of insufficient importanceto rule out the project if it was found that the construction of the road (with or without  a contribution  from  British funds)  would  materially assist  us inobtaining a satisfactory settlement of our frontier problems.  It would, however,be necessary to stipulate that this road should not be used for the transit of troopsor munitions.
APPENDIX  III.                          JTHE SOMALILAND FRONTIERS.                 ,      THE frontier line between British Somaliland and Abyssinia as defined in.  the  Anglo-Abyssinian Treaty of  1897 had the disastrous effect of bisecting the  traditional grazing areas of British  Somali  tribes.  Moreover,  it left  within  British territory  areas of poor grazing,  while  at  the  frontier there begins an.&apos;  area of superior grazing.      One  of the provisions of the 1897 Treaty was that tribes on either  side of  the  frontier were  to be free  to make use of their traditional grazing grounds on  the  other side.  The  position  was becoming  more  difficult as the Abyssinians.  developed a more efficient administration  in the frontier areas, and the Somali-I land  Government found  an  embarrassing  problem   in   the  administrationI of tribes  which  were accustomed  to spend part of  each year  in  territory I to which  a  British  officer  had  no right of access.   In  the early days  this Jdid  not matter as British officers were accustomed to  cross the undemarcated &quot;frontier  and,  in  effect,  to  administer tribes in what was really  Abyssinian  territory.  The demarcation of the frontier in 1933-34 put an end to that state  of affairs.      2.  The position in the Somaliland  frontier  areas can be summarised as  follows :       (a) At least three-fifths of the inhabitants of Somaliland, i.e., up to 200,000            people, have for  years crossed and  recrossed the frontier  freely in            search of water  and grazing.   To close the frontier to them would            cause bitter resentment and would  result in severe hardship, since the            grazing and water available in British Somaliland are inadequate to            maintain the population and stock.  Successive Governors of Somali-            land have stated  that a very difficult position indeed, threatening the            internal security  of the Protectorate, would  arise if British-protected            tribes  were  debarred  from the use of the trans-frontier  grazing-            grounds. Any attempt to divide the tribes so as  to leave a proportion            in British territory and the balance  in  Italian  territory would affect            our prestige and  would be difficult  to carry out in practice.      (b) The difficulty of administering the nomadic tribes of the  Protectorate            can  only  be effectively eased  if   these   are  all  brought  within the            exclusive jurisdiction of the Government of  British Somaliland.      3.  The desirability  of  adding the trans-frontier grazing areas to the Pro-  tectorate  has long been recognised,  and  negotiations were  about to begin with  the  Emperor of Abyssinia  with a  view  to  an exchange  of territory whereby  Abyssinia would be given the port of Zeila and a corridor linking it to Abyssinian  territory  in return for the acquisition of the grazing areas by British Somaliland.  These negotiations had, however, to be suspended following  the Walwal incident.  It will be recalled, however, that the offer to Abyssinia of  the port of Zeila and  the  corridor was  revived both immediately before  the  Italian-Abyssinian  war  (the &quot;Zeila offer&quot;)  and also  in  the  later proposals following the discussions  between Sir Samuel  Hoare  and M.  Laval.  It  was not contemplated, however,  under either of these latter arrangements that British Somaliland should acquire  the  grazing areas.      4.  With  the Italian  occupation of Abyssinia  it  became  necessary to  negotiate a modus vivendi whereby British-protected tribes would be free,  despite  the  Italian occupation, to cross the  frontier to  the  grazing areas as heretofore..  Accordingly, an agreement, effective for two years, was signed in Rome in January  1937 (Cmd.  5775).   The agreement provides generally that British-protected  tribes will be free  during  that period (i.e:, until the end of February 1939) to cross  and water up  to the traditional limits of their grazing areas  across the whole  length of the British  Somaliland-Abyssinian  frontier A.e:,  the limits indicated -  by the Anglo-Abyssinian Boundary  Commisson of 1935 subject to the with-  drawal of those limits some miles northwards  in the immediate neighbourhood of  Wardair  and Walwal.  The right of the tribes to  cross the frontier is  subject-        [18254]                                                       D
to the observance of certain conditions which have  not so far proved onerous inpractice.   Generally speaking, the agreement has worked satisfactorily and therehas been  no serious interference  with  British tribes during their periodicmigrations.     Reports  received from the  Governor indicate, however,  that  neither  the somali land Government nor the Italian authorities regard the existing arrange-,ment as an ideal one or  one that  should be made permanent.  These reports, confirm the opinion expressed by the British representatives who signed the RomeAgreement of 1937 :          &quot; It is not possible to be confident as to what may happen after two years.     The Italians readily agreed that the southern frontier of British Somaliland     was an artificial one drawn through the territory of British-protected nomadic     tribes, and that it was at present essential for these tribes to be able to graze     and water across the frontier.  But it is clear that the Italians have no real     liking for a state of affairs in which large numbers of British tribesmen cross     annually into territory under Italian control  They realize that,  for  the     moment,  no other arrangement  is feasible and  that it is to their advantage     to  have our co-operation in controlling trans-frontier movements.  But it     appears very doubtful whether they will be prepared to contemplate any such     arrangement as permanent, and this doubt is confirmed by their attitude over     the eastern frontier of the Protectorate as described in the following para-     graph.  It must be admitted that there is  much to be said for the Italian   :  point  of  view;  the  bi-annual crossing of the  frontier by large numbers of     alien nomadic tribesmen will be felt as  still more of an  inconvenience and     anomaly  as Italian administration  of  the frontier areas  becomes  more     .complete.   The only effective permanent solution of  this question remains,     therefore, in our view,  a rectification of the frontier so as to  include  the     grazing areas in British Somaliland, and if general negotiations take place     with Italy  in regard  to the Abyssinian frontier,  we would urge this as a     desideratum of the first importance.   We would hazard a guess that (always     provided that some territorial  quid  pro quo  could be found) the Italians     will be prepared to agree to such a rectification,  at any rate so far as concerns     the territory across the frontier in which the Ishaak and Dolbahanta graze.&quot;     5.  Our prestige in Somaliland has not unnaturally  suffered  on  account ofthe  Italian conquest of  Abyssinia and  their lavish expenditure in areas acrossthe frontier.  If Britain fails to obtain the grazing areas for the Protectorate, our-prestige with the Somali tribes will be  seriously  affected.  A renewal of  theexisting agreement  provides no effective solution : the Italians dislike it;  the tribes resent having to go into what they regard as their country on  sufferanceinstead of by right; and the  Somaliland  Administration would still be faced withthe  difficulty  of administering tribes who spend large parts of the year outsideBritish control.i.     It  is proposed, therefore, to ask the Italians to  agree to a rectification of theSouthern frontier of British Somaliland so as to bring into the Protectorate the grazing areas of the British tribes  up to the limits agreed upon  by the Anglo-Abyssinian Boundary Commission of 1935, subject to two modifications :-     (a) At the Eastern end of the frontier, as it  is most unlikely that the Italianswould  agree  to the  transfer of Walwal and  Wardair and the immediatelysurrounding area, it will be necessary to aim at a boundary coinciding with thelimits of grazing recognised in the Rome Agreement of January 1937; and     (b) At the  Western end of  the  frontier the grazing areas  recognised by the boundary Commission of 1935 and in the Rome  Agreement of 1937 extend to thewest of the  Jibuti  Railway.  As  it is  assumed  that the Italians  would  not(Countenance the transfer  of any territory to the west of, or abutting  on this railway, it is not proposed to ask that  this part of the grazing area should beincluded, in British Somaliland.   It is suggested, therefore, that in this area thefrontier should  follow the  existing frontier from the tri-junction point with french Somaliland to Samadu at the south-western  corner of British Somaliland,extending from that place to Gialdessa and then  running eastwards along thelimit of the grazing areas as already indicated.     The area which we hope to obtain  is coloured blue on Map  &quot; C,&quot;  and thedine from Samadu to Gialdessa is shown in red thereon.                    .  -&apos;
                          Eastern frontier situation.    8.  The Governor of Somaliland has expressed the hope that in the coarse of negotiations with Italy about the Abyssinian frontiers, it will be possible to secure a settlement of outstanding questions on the eastern frontier of the Protectorate,.i.e., that between British Somaliland and Italian Somaliland proper.    7.  Two questions arise here :  .       .    (a) The location  of the frontier  at its northern end.   The  Anglo-Italian           Boundary  Commission  of  1931, which demarcated this boundary,.           failed to agree on the location of the boundary near Banda Ziada, a           tiny port on the Gulf of Aden.   No vital interest is at stake here, and       I    the Government of British Somaliland has always been prepared to use           this as  a bargaining factor, i.e., to accept the  Italian line if an           advantage elsewhere might be facilitated by this course.    (b) The Italians have for some years closed the  eastern frontier  and have           refused  to  allow British-protected tribes  to cross  to  their grazing           grounds on the other side.   The Boundary Commission  demarcated           the frontier line and surveyed  the  tribal areas on either  side,  but           no formal  negotiations with Italy  concerning this agreement have           ever been undertaken.  Many attempts have been made (the last being           at  Borne in January 1937) to persuade the Italians to raise the ban           on trans-frontier migration without  prejudice to the  question of           future&quot;  permanent  arrangements.    The  Italians have,  however,           consistently declined to entertain any such proposal.  In  the circum-           stances,  the question has been considered whether it would be possible           to  negotiate a territorial adjustment of this boundary so  as to obtain           a more suitable line which would bring under  British protection the           grazing areas in Italian territory normally occupied by British tribes           and vice versa. The present Governor of British Somaliland  has,           however, opposed any such arrangement;  in his view the absence of           clear-cut tribal limits  in this area  would render  such a territorial           adjustment difficult. Thus, the  ideal solution remains that which we           have consistently advocated for many years, viz., the retention of the           present  frontier line with free  migration across  it for  British and           Italian  tribes  alike.   It  is doubtful whether it is worth while           attempting to secure such an arrangement in  the course  of the  new           negotiations.   Although  British tribes in  this  area have  suffered on           account  of the closing of the frontier, the position here is by no means           as  difficult as it is on the southern frontier, since the number of tribes-           men concerned  is much smaller,  while, with the exclusion of Italian           tribes from British Somaliland, there is  more grazing  for  British           tribes on our side of the frontier.  Nevertheless,  there may be some           advantage  in making an effort to secure freedom  of migration, on a           basis of  reciprocity, up to the limit of the grazing areas of our tribes           as  recognised by the Boundary  Commission, and coloured green on           Map &quot; C.&quot;  But, if the Italians  resist this claim, it is suggested  that.           the retention of the present eastern frontier as a closed frontier should           be  the first concession to be offered them in exchange for the trans-           frontier grazing areas  to the south of the Protectorate.                        Transit Traffic A rrangements.    8.  Simultaneously with the Grazing Rights Agreement negotiated at Rome-last year, another Agreement was  concluded to provide for Italian traffic acrossSomaliland to Abyssinia (Cmd. 5775).  Like the Grazing  Rights Agreement, it came into force on the  1st March, 1937, and  is valid for two years from that date,,at the end of  which period it may be renewed by mutual consent.  The Italians,had been anxious to obtain facilities  for the  transport of goods from  british somali land to the  Harar  district,  and  the Agreement  granted these  facilitiessubject to certain conditions; e.g., the Italian Government undertook to reimbursethe Government of  British Somaliland for the cost of the roads required for the.       [18254]                                                    D 2
 traffic; they also agreed that transit dues should be charged on traffic* passing through the Protectorate, to enable the Somaliland Government to recover  its administrative expenditure in connection with it.     9.   As a reswlt of this arrangement considerable work has,been carried out on the  construction of roads in Somaliland, but the traffic has not reached the tonnage originally contemplated, partly owing to the restriction of purchases by the Italians in Abyssinia, and partly because the British authorities insisted on being reimbursed for any  expenditure incurred under  the Agreement.   There have also been difficulties over the interpretation of the Agreement, and in  its operation, and a number of these were amicably and  satisfactorily settled at a Conference at Harar between the British and Italian authorities this summer. Certain proposals, however,  which  the  Counsellor of the Italian Embassy  in London had made earlier this year about the construction and financing of port works at Zeila,  and  the imposition of wharfage dues there, have not yet been accepted.  His representations made it clear  that the Italians were disappointed with the results  obtained from the Transit Traffic Agreement, and he intimated that, unless the  Agreement could be  made  to operate more satisfactorily, the Italian Government might be obliged  to terminate not only the Transit Traffic Agreement, but also the Grazing Rights  Agreement next Spring.   The termina- tion of  the Grazing Rights Agreements, without any provision for safeguarding the grazing and watering rights (acquired by Treaty  with  Ethiopia)  of our tribesmen, would be  a calamity for Somaliland, and  in order to avert it the Somaliland Government and the Departments in this country concerned have been considering to what  extent the  Italian  Governments representations  could  be met.  -Certain proposals to this end were about to be communicated to the Italian Embassy when His Majesty&apos;s Governments  recent decision to bring into force the Anglo-Italian Agreement of April  1938 opened up the prospect  of early negotiations with Italy on the subject of the Abyssinian frontiers.  In the altered circumstances it  is suggested that the concessions which it was intended to make to the Italians should be held in  reserve for the present and included in the offer for the  improvement of the Transit Traffic Agreement which would be set out  as one of the compensations to Italy for the proposed cession by her of the Grazing Areas lying to the south of the present Somaliland frontier.     10.  With  the object of  making  the  Transit  Traffic  Agreement more attractive to the Italians, the grant of free  zones at Berbera and at Zeila has recently been under consideration.     Provided that the Italians agree to a satisfactory  frontier rectification, the Governor has advocated that  they should be  granted a free zone  at Berbera  Of Zeila.   The zone would abut on the port, and  all road-works, water supplies, buildings, wharfs, &amp;c, would be constructed by the Italians at their own expense, and the zone would carry with it freedom from Customs duties and transit dues. The War Office and the Air Ministry,  however,  regard this proposal as open  to the most serious objections, as they assume that the Somaliland Government wouldnot be permitted  to exercise surveillance over the free zone, or to enter it without the permission of the Italian authorities.   Even if-some form of supervision were permitted, the institution of  such a zone might be a  threat to the security  of Berbera and impose on the military authorities a liability for which the presentforces are inadequate.  They are, therefore, definitely opposed to the institution of  a free zone at Berbera.  As regards  Zeila,  the Governor believes  that theFrench  might not like the idea of the Italians having  a  free zone in that town,which is in close  proximity to Jibuti in French Somaliland, and this proposal isalso open to objections from the defence point of view.  The Air Ministry pointout that, in addition to the objections mentioned above, Zeila is within 160 miles of* Aden and has  a prepared landing ground which is sometimes used as-an inter-intermediary stop between Aden and other places  in Somaliland.  From the air pointof  view therefore there  are  obvious objections  to permitting the Italians  to establish themselves in this area.  The question of granting free zones at either Berbera or Zeila or at both  will, however,  be  further  investigated,  as it  is considered that there  might be  some advantage in securing  something for the Italians of this nature if they should be anxious for it.    * The Italians were given to understand in the course of the negotiations at Rome that the transit of troops or munitions through British Somaliland would not be permitted, and, in fact, nosuch transit has taken place.                          
      11.   If, as.is highly probable, the Italians will not regard (1) the confirmation of the Eastern boundary as a closed frontier, and (2) the conclusion of a permanent Transit  Traffic Agreement, as sufficient recompense for the surrender of the Southern grazing areas to Somaliland, it will very likely be necessary to  offer Italy some territorial &quot;compensation.                               &apos;  -      12.   The transfer  to the Italians  of Zeila, with a  corridor linking it  with former Abyssinian territory, has been considered again in recent years, but there are serious objections to this proposal both on political  and strategical grounds, and it has been thought undesirable to pursue it.  The Governor of Somaliland was asked,  however, whether,  if the  Italians were disposed  to consider  the rectification of the Southern frontier in our favour, and demanded the rectification of the Eastern frontier in theirs, he would be prepared to recommend some other territorial concession.  Sir Arthur Lawrance&apos;s attitude was that, as a last resort and if everything else  failed, he would be prepared to  recommend the transfer to the Italians of an area of about 2,088 square miles  on the Eastern frontier of the Protectorate  (coloured red on Map  C), bounded  by a straight  line from the frontier to  Buran, thence by a straight line to Taleh (including Taleh), thence due East to the frontier; but that the area so transferred must not include Buran itself, without  which a  large area in that neighbourhood would be uninhabitable by our tribesmen.  It was pointed out  to the Governor  that  the transfer of the area suggested would create an awkward salient in the  Italian line, and  that there would  probably be a  better chance of Italian  acceptance  of the proposal if we could offer them  the limit of the Mijertein grazing area  (the area South of Taleh), i.e:, the Buran-Taleh-Garowe line (excluding Buran); and possibly also a line from Buran to  the sea fifteen miles West of the existing frontier. But Sir Arthur Lawrance is definitely opposed to the transfer,  even in the last resort, of either of these areas.  They are shown marked  with red hatchings on Map  C.      IS.   The tribal  position in respect of the Buran-Taleh area seems to be as follows :  It lies partly in the country of  the Warsangeli and partly in the country of the Dolbahanta Mahmood Gerad.  With the former tribe there is a treaty of the 27th January, 1886, but we have no treaty with the Dolbahanta.  It may be taken for granted that  these tribes would object most strongly to the transfer to Italy of rights over any part of the territory; they hold very firmly to the views that neither the 1894  Protocol nor the 1897 Treaty should ever have been made, as both agreements, made without their consent, cut through  their recognised tribal areas, and any satisfaction of  British claims  in respect of the grazing areas on the Southern frontier would be regarded by these tribes as merely a rectification of past wrongs.  Consultation with the tribes concerned would be necessary before any withdrawal from  territory  in favour of Italy  could take place, and the Governor considers that no  difficulty could arise in arranging for such consulta- tion.  He has also expressed the view  that; if the tribes  refuse to agree to the transfer  of  the Buran-Taleh area to the Italians, the great benefits which the Protectorate would gain on the Southern frontier would be the justification for setting aside the protests and transferring the area contrary to their wishes. It, should be explained  that no British-protected  tribes  or  sections  of tribes would pass into the jurisdiction of the Italians by the transfer of the Buran-Taleh area. There are no known minerals in the Buran-Taleh area.     14.  It  is likely  that the Italians will propose that the Somaliland Govern- ment should  share in the capital cost of any further road-work  required on the transit routes  through  the Protectorate, and also in the additional  recurrent expenditure on maintenance that would be involved; but it is not proposed to entertain any such suggestion unless it is found that the concessions previously mentioned in  this Appendix  prove  insufficiently  attractive  to  the  Italians. Estimates supplied by the Government show that the  capital cost of bringing the Berbera-Hargeisa frontier  road (170  miles),  the only one at present used for transit traffic, up to a standard capable of carrying 4-ton lorries, would be  66,000, and the annual expenditure on maintenance would be  12,000.  The capital cost of building a road from Zeila to the frontier (48 miles) would be  28,000, and the annual cost of maintenance  4,000.   The  conditions for road  construction in Somaliland are.very  bad, and really good permanent roads can be built only at -considerable expense.  (Indeed, the cost of constructing  all-weather  roads in the Protectorate  is estimated to be   5,000 a mile.)  The cost of maintenance is likely
to increase from year to year, and even in the first year it is higher than it would,be in the case of an  all-weather road, but  it  is obvious that even the  most favourable estimate  of the amount of traffic likely to pass over the roads could.not justify thg expenditure involved in constructing all-weather roads, except:&apos;in the unlikely event of the Italians  agreeing to  defray the entire cost.  It  mustbe realized, however, that the life of the new  roads with the normal rate ofmaintenance will be  limited, and the local Public Works Department estimate itat five years, after which more construction would be required.  The possibilityof offering the Italians some financial assistance is now under consideration, andit is understood that the Treasury agree that it would be reasonable to offer tobear a proportion, not exceeding  half, of  the capital cost as well as a similarproportion of the cost of maintenance of the roads from Berbera and Zeila to thefrontier.  On the basis of the most recent estimates this expenditure would amountto  47,000 capital,  and   8,000 recurrent,  assuming that  the Somaliland sharewas  50  per cent, of  the whole.     15.  There is also the possibility of our offering a transit agreement on the-Kismayu-Moyale road in Kenya,  if  necessary with  a financial &quot;contribution toconstruction and maintenance (vide paragraph 12 of Appendix II).     In the last resort, it may be necessary to reconsider the question of the cession.of the area marked D on Map B (vide paragraphs 9-11 of  Appendix II).
