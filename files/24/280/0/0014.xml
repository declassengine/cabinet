CP.  259 (38)            CABINET                        DEFENCES OF EIRE.              Joint  Memorandum by the Secretary  of  State              for Dominion Affairs and the  Minister for              Co-ordination of Defence.       We  think  that  our  colleagues should be aware of a questionwhich  has  Deen raised with  us  on Mr.  de Valera&apos;s behalf regardingthe  arrangements for  reorganising the  defence services in Eire.         On the 12th October Mr. Dulanty and Mr.  Walshe ( of the eire Department  of External Affairs)  came to see the Secretary ofState  for  Dominion Affairs  to  report  that Mr. de Valera had himself  taken charge  of the Defence Department for the time being(owing to  the illness of  the Minister  of Defence) and v/asanxious  to take  immediate action to get the defences of Eire, thecondition  of which v/as causing him anxious concern, into asatisfactory state.   From  this point  of view he was desirous ofobtaining  a really good military man with experience of war toadvise him on defence matters.   Mr. de Valera had been anxiousto invite  an officer from the  British Army for the purpose but after  reflection he had come to the conclusion that for internal political  reasons this plan was really impossible and. that toattempt  to adopt it would defeat his ooject.   It would heobjectionable to many even  of  his political supporters and itwou*ld he hurrying matters too  quickly  in the direction of openco-operation between Eire and  the United Kingdom on defence.His  idea therefore was that he should  find some French general tebecome his principal military  adviser, and he wished to know what
our view on this would &quot;be.   He appreciated, the difficulties ofthe position regarding the communication to such an officer ofour secret defence papers, hut expressed the hope that we should feel able to show goodwill to the plan and that we should heable to recommend, by name, some French officer of standingwith whom our General Staff was acquainted and in whom  we shouldhave confidence.   At any rate, in his view, it would make itclear to Germany and others that Sire was on the side of theWestern democracies.       The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that hewould have to discuss the question with the Minister forCo-ordination of Defence;  in the meantime, he asked whetherit was contemplated that, apart from this arrangement, thereshould still be discussions between the Eire military advisers and the United Kingdom military authorities on a joint defenceplan for co-operation in case Sire and the United Kingdom were involved together;  Mr.  Walshe said that this proposal stillstood.         The Minister for Co-Ordination of Defence arranged for the proposal to be considered by the Chiefs of Staff.Their view was briefly that while, if Mr. de Valera v/ere to insist on the  appointment of a French adviser, the UnitedKingdom Government could not actively object, we should be bound to take the line that any such appointment would createreal difficulty as regards co-operation in defence matters asbetween Eire and the United Kingdom.   The Chiefs of Staff   t,                                                   -thought that it would be impossible to supply any Frenchadviser with, particulars of secret defence apparatus used here.On the other hand, without such information, any French advisercalled upon to deal with the question of the defended ports                                                      would                             -2-
would; find himself  at a. great disadvantage.   Although it wasappreciated  that  the Sire  authorities themselves were prepared      M       -                      -        - Mi %    .to give proper assurances  regarding secrecy and we should therefore he  able to confide secret information to thatGovernment,  this  information would he useless to them if theywere precluded from handing it on to their chief defenceadviser.   The Chiefs of Staff suggested that it might be possible to  discover an officer in one of the Dominion forceswild was -suitably  qualified for the work which Mr.  de valera had In mind.         It was arranged that the Minister for Co-ordinationof Defence should see the  High Commissioner for Sire andcommunicate  to him  this opinion expressed by the Chiefs ofStaff,   He made it plain  to Mr.  Dulauty that there was noquestion at all about our  willingness to give theGovernment of Sire  any information on defence matters whichthey desired  to have, or which we could think of,  but thatthere were insuperable objections to passing on some of itto a foreigner.   He added that the Chiefs of Staff had,moreover, called attention to the fact that French military experts were almost entirely concerned with the defence ofland frontiers and  would not be very suitable advisers  on thematters in question.   Mr. Dulanty said that, as -regardsthe possibility of  obtaining a Dominion adviser., he had ascertained that Mr. de Valera was not in fact prepared totake anyone from the Dominions.        Mr.  Dulanty said that he had been thinking thatpernaps there might be,  say, 75% of the advice and information which we could give which  would be invaluable to Eire, andwhich we could agree could be communicated to be used by a french adviser, while the  other 25% was too secret for such                                               communication;
 communication; he,asked the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence  if  thi^s proposal could he examined,      &apos; , .       At  the request of the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence,  this proposal was considered by the Chiefs of Staff, who  reported that such an arrangement was impracticable. Both in  the field of documents and material the highly secret was  so closely related to the less secret, and in fact so  often constituted the essential feature of the whole, that it would not he possible to discriminate between them.    This view was communicated by the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence to Mr.  Dulanty, who then put forward  another proposal.    This was made orally, and was to the  effect  that, if the French General was not appointed as a permanent adviser, &quot;but was only consulted at intervals when advice as to some particular aspect of defence was required, it might &quot;be possible for the secret information which would &quot;be imparted by the United Kingdom Government to he withheld from the French adviser.   *         The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence discussed this  new proposal with the Chiefs of Staff, who felt that they could not usefully add anything to.the views that they had already  expressed as to the uhdesirability, from the military point of view,  of the whole idea of a French adviser to the Government  of Eire.    After further consideration with some of his colleagues, the Minister for Co-ordination of Defencewrote to Mr. Dulanty putting the suggestion that theGovernment of Sire should ask for,  and obtain from us, all the  information as to port defences  which is not secret and therefore could he communicated to a foreigner.   Trie SireGovernment would then be  in a position to make full use of the                                                  information
information in obtaining the advice of their foreign, adviseras to the proper defences to &quot;be installed,   Afte-r the adviserhad given his assistance in connection with the matters upon whichthe Government of Eire desired his advice, he would drop out andwe should &quot;be able to communicate to that Government any information of a secret nature which might &quot;be desired, entirelyupon the understanding that this information was to &quot;be keptstrictly secret and not communicated to any foreigner.       Mr. Dulanty has now intimated that this suggestion is acceptable to his Government and has asked the Minister forCo-ordination of Defence for the names of two or three Frenchsoldiers &quot;from amongst whom they could select an adviser.Mr.  Dulanty added that it was obviously essential that nocommunication should be made to any of the soldiers in question.        The Minister for Go-ordination of Defence has instructed-his Staff to consult the War Office as to the French military officers whose names might be given to Mr. Dulanty.                                      -  M.M.                                      .
