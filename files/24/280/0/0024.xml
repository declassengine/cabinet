                      FIRST MEETING,  AT 10 A.M.    M. DALADIER opened the proceedings by welcoming the British represen-tatives.   He was Convinced that on the last occasion when they had met, namely,at Munich, he had correctly interpreted French feeling, while Mr. Chamberlain,for his part, could not have failed to notice  from the marked enthusiasm of hisreception in Paris on the previous day his own popularity in France.  This was,not an official conference, but rather an exchange of  views  between friendswho had  confidence in  each other, and who believed that  a continuation of theircollaboration was essential for the maintenance of peace in Europe.    ME.  CHAMBERLAIN expressed his thanks to M. Daladier for the invita-tion to renew relations so happily begun in London.   His visit to Paris hadalready given him an opportunity of observing the spontaneous enthusiasm of thepeople, which  constituted an expression of the approval of the policy which hadbeen followed  in common.  Lie agreed that it was not an official conference,  but rather a means  for renewing and  strengthening  mutual confidence,  and an occasion for the representatives of the two countries to  know each other&apos;s minds.Franco-German A greement.    M. BONNET stated that M. Daladier wished him first of all to speak of therecent agreement between the French and German Governments.  On the morrowof the Munich Conference, and in the course of an interview between Herr hitler and M. Francois-Poncet, the bases had been laid for a Franco-German  declara-tion on the lines of the Anglo-German declaration brought back from Munich byMr. Chamberlain., The French Ambassador in Berlin saw Herr Hitler on various occasions in this connexion, and M. Bonnet spoke to the German Ambassador inParis; and His Majesty&apos;s Government were kept informed of the progress of thenegotiations.  On the  7th  November M. Bonnet thought  that the terms of  thedeclaration had been definitely fixed,  and the British Ambassador in Paris hadbeen so informed.  The assassination of Herr vom Rath, however, had come assomewhat of a set-back.  None the less, only  two days later Count Welczeck had informed M. Bonnet that the  German Government were in agreement with theFrench Government as to the text of the declaration, and it was arranged thatthe declaration should be signed subsequently on behalf of the  German Govern-mentby Herr von Ribbentrop.  The text of  the declaration, however, would notbe  published  before signature, nor  before  prior consultation  with the repre-sentatives  of  His  Majesty&apos;s  Government.  At some later  hour in  the  day,M. Bonnet said,  a  communique would be issued to the effect  that the FrenchGovernment and the German Government were in agreement with regard to theconclusion  of  a Franco-German Agreement,  the signature of which would takeplace the following week.  M. Bonnet then read the text of the declaration, whichwas as follows :     (1) The German Government and the French Government are convinced, in           full agreement, that peaceful and good-neighbourly relations between           Germany and France are one of the most  essential elements of the           consolidation of the European situation  and of  the maintenance of           general  peace.. For this reason, the two  Governments will  do every-           thing in their power to ensure that relations  between their countries           should develop in this sense.     (2) The two Governments affirm that no further territorial question remains           in suspense between their countries, and they recognise solemnly as           final the frontier as it is actually drawn between their countries.     (3) The two Governments are  resolved, with reserve as to their particular   v -       relations with third Powers, to keep in touch  as regards all questions           which interest their  two countries,  and to consult together if the           evolution of these questions should,, in the  future, give rise to inter-           national difficulties.  (A copy of  the French and German texts of the           declaration was handed to the British Delegation.  The French  text           will be found as Annex A to this record.)     MR.   CHAMBERLAIN   thanked  M.   Bonnet  for  giving  the British Delegation the text of the declaration, and said that he wished to say at once that  the terms appeared entirely in accord with the  general  policy agreed on
between the French Government and His Majesty&apos;s Government.  His Majesty&apos;sGovernment had never doubted that if  agreement could be  reached  betweenthe French  Government and the German Government it would be such as  todeserve  their whole-hearted support.  He gave his sincere  congratulations  toM. Bonnet on the conclusion of the agreement, which constituted  another step towards appeasement in Europe.    M.  BONNET, in reply to an  enquiry  by Lord  Halifax  with regard  tothe communique mentioned above, stated that the French Government had raised the question of the publication of such a communique with the German Govern-ment, but that they had  as yet received no reply.Anglo-French Defence Measures.    M.  DALADIER suggested that the first question  to be  discussed shouldbe the problem of the organisation of defence.  It might seem to be unnecessarilysceptical to talk about such things so soon after an agreement, but, in presentcircumstances,  if  one  wished  the  Franco-German declaration to  have a real value it was essential that France  should not slacken her efforts in the matterof defence.  In this matter co-operation with Great Britain was necessary in allpossible ways.  The position was clear enough, and there were two  points whichhe wished to emphasise: first, on  France&apos;s  North-Eastern frontier  Germanfortifications were being unceasingly increased and improved; moreover, Belgium&apos;snew  position vis-a-vis of the League of Nations, particularly with regard  to article  16 of the  Covenant,  made  action by  France against Germany, or byGermany  against  France, extremely  difficult.   In  fact,  in the  event of war, acertain  immobility would become  apparent,  except  in the air,  where  strongfortifications act as a temptation  to air bombardment.  M.  Daladier&apos;s second point was that  the weak point of the Rome-Berlin axis seemed  to him to  beItaly, contrary to what Signor Mussolini so frequently said; and it was alwayspossible to launch an attack against Italy by land.  The French army might  be moved up towards Italy.   M. Daladier wished  to  emphasise the importance  of north Africa, Egypt, Algeria and  other  Mediterranean territories in the eventof a future conflict in  that area.    MR. CHAMBERLAIN said that he did not quite  understand M. Daladier&apos;s.point about  the  French army moving up to the  Italian frontier.  Lie askedwhether that did not rest on the assumption that Italy would go in at once in theevent of a quarrel between France and Germany, whereas it seemed more probablethat  Italy, conscious  of her  own weakness, would  wait  and  watch  beforecommitting herself.    M. DALADIER admitted the possibility envisaged by Mr.  Chamberlain, but said that it seemed to him difficult  for Italy to remain  in her present  position.She had lost much as a result of recent events, and she might one day seek com-pensation.  In any case, however, it was  essential  to consider the  possibility  of very close collaboration  between the military,  air and naval forces of France andGreat Britain.  This would not be easy, but conversations on  the lines of thepresent ones were necessary if France and Great Britain were not one day to  betaken by surprise.  France&apos;s geographical position was  such that  she would  bethe first to be struck.  It was a position which military technicians called a cover-position.  It made intensive collaboration necessary between France and GreatBritain with regard to  defensive measures, in such a way as to make it possibleto foresee what action might be taken from the very beginning of a conflict, andeven before a declaration of war, since it was quite possible that  an air attackmight precede a declaration of war.  In conclusion, M. Daladier suggested that,without adopting any rigid system, it might be advisable for Great Britain andFrance to consider the possibility of meetings between military and civil repre-sentatives from the two countries  to examine the question  from  the practical point of view.    MR. CHAMBERLAIN said that he understood  M. Daladier  to say that,owing to her geographical position, France would be  the first to be struck.   it seemed to him, however, that one should consider all possible contingencies.  Thepresent attitude of Germany had brought before His Majesty&apos;s Government thepossibility of a quarrel between Great Britain and Germany rather  than between france and Germany, and the first  blow might well, therefore, be struck against      [18261]                            &quot;                         B 2
Great Britain rather than France.  Mr. Chamberlain recalled that on more thanone occasion in the past M. Delbos had said that, in such an eventuality, france would  consider herself bound to go  to the assistance  of  Great Britain.   HisMajesty&apos;s Government had always understood that this view had continued to bethat of the Government of M. Chautemps;  and Mr. Chamberlain asked whetherM. Daladier could confirm that the French Government still  held this view.     M. DALADIER replied that to ask such a question was to be provided withthe  answer :   the  present French Government felt  still more strongly that, if great  Britain were attacked by Germany, France would be bound to go to her assistance.  If Mr.  Chamberlain wished to say so publicly, or  if  he wishedM. Daladier to do so, he considered that the first possible occasion should be taken for a categorical  declaration to be made in this sense.     ME. CHAMBERAIN said  that  he was much obliged for this  response tohis enquiry.  He  thought that such a  declaration might be  a good  thing, thoughit need not necessarily  be made at once but rather whenever M. Daladier thought fit.   This question had a direct bearing  on the desirability  of a close under-standing between French and British experts.  For example, Great Britain mightbe attacked  alone and France would have to  consider  how to come to her assistance; and this  aspect  of the question  might be made the subject of staff conversations  between  the two countries.     M. DALADIER agreed.  Staff conversations  hitherto had given  excellent results. . Even if certain  technical questions  needed to be reconsidered,  therewere certain  points on which definite and considerable progress had been made.The  Staff conversations which had  taken place in London  had led to important decisions, e.g., with regard to petrol, air fuel and naval collaboration.   It mightbe as well to consider  some means  for further collaboration between the Staffs,There were still various deficiencies on both sides. / France must make a greatereffort with regard to aviation, whereas Great Britain, it seemed to him, shouldmake a more rapid effort with regard to land armaments. In a war in which great Britain was attacked by  Germany, French assistance would be given &apos;toGreat  Britain in proportion as the French Air Force  was capable of keeping in check the first  German attack.  Aviation in France had been through a periodof crisis. French industrial methods had  not  been very  fortunate.   Aircraftconstruction  had  been far  too long  considered as simply work for  artisans.M.  Daladier,  however, had  seen that this must be changed.  He  had spent800  million francs on  machine tools and there had already been a considerablerevival  of activity in  the  French  aircraft  industry.  It  was well known  that between  the  installation of equipment and the  serial  production of machinessome seven or eight months must elapse.  This had  been so  in the United States,and  about the same time  would be  required by the  French industry.  until recently no really satisfactory  results had  been obtained.   M.  Daladier had appointed M. Caquot, who was President  of  the Societe  des  Ingenieurs deFrance, to be head of all nationalised aircraft  factories.   Unity of commandwas  most important,  and as  a result of M. Caquofs nomination, series of modernplanes were beginning  to come out of  the factory.  M. Daladier said that Francenow had 2,600 aeroplanes and was hoping by the end of next spring to have a production of 400 a month with 4,000 planes by  the end of the year.  these would be modern machines.  It had been a mistake that the previous Air Minister,General Denain, had paid more attention to quantity than quality.  As a resultFrance had a great many aeroplanes  but they were old. Already, however, theresults of serial production were to be seen in the monthly increase&apos;of output.At  present France was capable of an output of 80 modern  aeroplanes of  thebest kind a  month.   With the introduction of  serial  production the problembecame simply a question of obtaining the necessary financial  credits.     MR. CHAMBERLAIN said that he wished  to ask a question.  He had beenvery impressed by the figure of 400 modern machines a month in six months&apos; time.But  it  appeared that France was only  producing  80 machines a month at present.Was M.  Daladier quite certain that in six months&apos; time her output would be fivetimes as much \  If this should be so it was astonishing in view of His Majesty&apos;governments own experience.   The  British industry had not yet reached  thefigure of 400  a month.                                                  .
    M. DALADIER said that he understood that the figure of British production was 300 machines a month.  As regards French production he confirmed what hehad already said.    MR. CHAMBERLAIN said that during the last month the British aircraft industry had produced&quot; 350 machines and production was  increasing month bymonth.  By the end of next summer it was hoped to produce 700 or 800 machinesa.month.   At the same time it was only now that His Majesty&apos;s Government were beginning to reap the reward of their efforts during the last  two years.    M. DALADIER said that the increase in French production was the  resultof only one year&apos;s efforts.  Previously  French air industry had been important,and in 1935 the French Air Force had been unsurpassed in Europe in number and quality, but, subsequently,  any further development of  prototypes  had been abandoned.  He well understood Mr. Chamberlaiifs scepticism with regard  to thefigures which he had given.  In the aeronautical industry, however,  questions ofmethod were all-important.  The production of land  armaments  had continuedwithout interruption, largely because in that  industry there  was generally oneresponsible director who gave the orders.  In the aeronautical  industry there hadbeen no unity of command until recently.  Now,  however, there was cohesionbetween the various industries involved.  M.  Caquot, to whom he  had  already referred, had produced thousands of aeroplanes per month in 1915 : such pro-duction was easier then than now, but M. Daladier said that he noped that  thefigures which he had given would be reached by next spring.   It was, of course,impossible to foresee what might happen between now and then, but he hoped tohave an important number of aeroplanes by the spring.  Close contact was  being maintained with  the United States  aircraft industry, and a very  considerablenumber of aeroplanes  could be delivered  to  France from the  United States,provided,  of course, that  the French Government could find the financial means.France hoped to be able to buy a thousand aeroplanes from  the United States bynext spring; and the necessary financial effort would be made.   M. Daladier saidthat he had already obtained credits for 8^ milliard francs for this year.  A credit.of 11 milliards had been obtained for 1940, that is to say, almost 20 milliards overa period of two years.    MR.   CHAMBERLAIN thanked  M. Daladier  for  this information and expressed  the hope that his expectations would be fulfilled.  He still felt, however,a little doubt as to the accuracy of the French figures, a doubt which was  based,on experience in Great Britain, where such calculations had often turned out tobe incorrect.  It had been the experience of His Majesty&apos;s Government that  in thematter of  aircraft production work must be spread, that is to  say, that all orders should not be given to the same firm.  A central firm drew the  necessary partsfrom other firms  and by this  method  output  was  satisfactorily increased.  he hoped that efforts to increase production in France would be more effective thanthey had been in Great Britain.  This question, however, would be for discussion by the Secretary of State for Air when he came to Paris.   All he wished to  say at this juncture was that  if His Majesty&apos;s Government could help- technicallythey were only too anxious to do so.    M. DALADIER said  that the Secretary  of State for  Air would be put intouch with M. Caquot.  He admitted that he himself was always inclined to besceptical when presented  with figures purporting to show the increase of aircraft production.  In any event France was determined  to obtain as many aeroplanesas possible from the United States and possibly also from Holland, where excellentaeroplanes were being made.  As regards land  armaments, M.  Daladier said that recent events in Europe  had strengthened the power of Germany and Italy on land.   As a result of  a  diminution of the importance of the Czechoslovakianforces Germany now had means of making an attack through Holland, Belgiumor Switzerland.  The French Army was good, but the population  was  limited.A number of new colonial divisions were being formed  and, as His Majesty&apos;sGovernment were aware, a period of two years&apos; military service  was in force inFrance. With a population of about 40 million France was in  a difficult position.None the less, she was capable of mobilising 100 divisions in all.  Fifteen of these divisions would be sent to fortifications, while the  rest, which were  very mobile,would be placed where  they might be needed.  France had at present 2,000 tanks and in 1940 he hoped that she would have 4,000. In the tank industry the progress
of production was steady and there seemed to be no reason to doubt the figuregiven for 1940.  M.  Daladier expressed his growing preference for heavy tanks.Recent experience had shown that German, Italian and Russian tanks had beenpenetrated with comparative ease,  and in this respect France was in  advance.As regards the general question of land armaments, however, M.  Daladier saidthat he wished to emphasise  the need for greater support from Great Britain inthe event of German attack on Great Britain or France.  It was  not enough tosend two divisions after three weeks.  More  divisions were needed and  as  faras possible they should be motorised.     ME.  CHAMBERLAIN  said that he had given  thought to this point andthat he had tried to prevent an undue proportion of the resources of Great Britainbeing  spent on naval armaments.   If His Majesty&apos;s Government had  disposedof unlimited resources, they would have liked to be able to send a formidable force to the Far East, but in view  of other demands they had had to limit the amountdevoted  to the Navy.   The  development of aviation had seriously altered  theposition in Europe, to  the disadvantage of Great Britain.   So long as GreatBritain  could only be attacked by sea, her defence was easy.  But London was now the most vulnerable capital in the world.  Within 24 hours of warfare Londonmight be in ruins, and most of the important industrial centres in  Great britain as well.   The principal armament centres were within range of enemy  aircraft.His Majesty&apos;s Government was bound to take account of  the fact  that the nervecentres of Great Britain might be  paralysed  at the outset of war.  This was a vital point, and it was their first duty to make Great  Britain as safe as possible.His Majesty&apos;s Government were devoting themselves first  to the  equipment of anti-aircraft defence, including guns, and to the production of bombing  planes(which would destroy aerodromes and factories), and fighting planes (to encounterenemy bombing squadrons).  The result of their consideration of the problem hadbeen that they had decided  to give priority  to  anti-aircraft defences  over  thedemands of the land forces,  whenever they competed.  They did compete in  theproduction of artillery.  Equipment for the production of heavy artillery was of adifferent kind, but the very factory where anti-aircraft guns were being producedwould otherwise have been chosen  to produce field guns for the army.  Anti-aircraft gun production was a very highly skilled process, especially the mountingsof guns and the making  of  instruments of precision.  The French knew moreabout  this than anyone else; and as His Majesty&apos;s Government now believed it possible to have sufficient anti-aircraft guns and to organise  air defence in such away as to make it difficult for an attacking force to make sure  of  hitting itsobjective, they were paying  particular attention to anti-aircraft  gun factories.As a result,  the strength  of any force which would come  to the  assistance ofFrance must be limited by the fact that its equipment, both of medium and heavy artillery, was not complete.  A great deal of the present equipment for  use withthe force was obsolescent, if not obsolete.  The anti-aircraft  guns were not of  thelatest type, and it would take some time to remedy these defects.   Great britain was also deficient in tanks; for it had taken a long time to decide on the right typeof tank.  The situation would improve, but it seemed to be of no use to increasethe number of troops which  would be ready  to  be sent abroad, if it were  notpossible  to equip them properly.  Mr. Chamberlain said he had nothing to addon this point to what had already been said in the Staff Conversations.  He wishedto repeat, however, that  His  Majesty&apos;s Government were impressed by  thenecessity for perfecting their air defence.  Their aim was to increase output and capacity. Since the Munich Agreement, His Majesty&apos;s Government had  begun to lay down new factories and to extend and re-equip old factories for the productionof anti-aircraft  guns.   When sufficient anti-aircraft guns  had been made,  the factories would be free to produce guns for the artillery.   That was the  position,and there was no need to attempt to conceal it.    M. DALADIER said he  had listened with interest to the information which mr. Chamberlain had given him.  He well knew the great effort which was beingmade by Great Britain, particularly since Mr. Chamberlain became head  of  theGovernment.   But he wondered if the problem were being faced from the rightangle.   He feared that it  was not.  The  aeroplane  was a weapon which hadradically altered the situation.  A strong aviation capable of striking horror in .the hearts of the  enemy&apos;s civilian population  was  a  decisive  weapon.    He;wondered, however, whether it was a good idea to put anti-aircraft  defence above
everything else.   He  thought not.   Obviously,  anti-aircraft  defence  was important, but, in his view, it was better to defend London by having bomberswhich might go and bomb German towns rather than by concentrating principallyon anti-aircraft guns.  He did not believe that fighting aircraft were a sufficientdefence  against bombers, which nowadays were so rapid and mobild that he wassceptical as to the possibility of stopping  them easily.  Moreover, the difference of speed between bombing and  fighting  aircraft  was now only a few kilometresan hour, and  bombers were  just as easy to handle as fighters.  M. Daladiersaid that he was convinced that if Germany and Italy thought  that France hadan impressive  bombing force  capable of  destroying their towns, that would con7stitute a better defence  than  any anti-aircraft scheme.  Types  of aircraft werecontinually being  improved and he wondered whether it  was possible  to hitbombers nowadays with anti-aircraft guns.  French anti-aircraft guns were good;the Paris defences could fire  2,500 shells a minute, but he was  still sceptical oftheir real value.   In  the circumstances, he hoped  Great Britain would accentuateher efforts in producing bombing nmchines.  Finally,  and quite apart from theeffect on Germany of the bombardment of the Ruhr, for example, or the effect on italy of the bombardment of Genoa, Naples or Rome, M. Daladier was  convincedthat French opinion would be calmer if France was in a position to inflict heavybombardment on enemy  territory .     MR. CHAMBERLAIN  said that he  was very  glad that  M.  daladier had  developed this point.  He wished, however,  to reassure him with  regard tothe attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government.  He thought it would  be  unwise tounderrate thewalue of fighters and anti-aircraft guns, which could  at least forcebombing aircraft to rise higher and higher, thereby making it more difficult forthem to hit their mark.  It  was true that you could terrify  people by indis-criminate bombing, but  you could  not win a war.   Moreover,  in the particular case of  Great  Britain, the prevalence of mist  and bad visibility, together withthe existence of a force of efficient fighting machines, could  make it very difficult for enemy bombers to work effectively.  Mr. Chamberlain said that he wished toexplain that the  programme  of His Majesty&apos;s Government with regard  to theproportion of  bombing and fighting aeroplanes had not undergone any change.After the Anglo-German declaration at Munich there were indications that if he spoke of the need to fill up deficiencies in British defence, Herr Hitler might argue that that implied lack of confidence, to which he could only reply by doubling the armaments of  Germany.  Mr. Chamberlain did not wish him to be  able to do so.When, at this juncture, the Secretary of State for Air had had to make a state-ment about air defence  (he did  not do so at the wish of Mr.  Chamberlain, but because such a declaration was  necessary), Mr.  Chamberlain had  asked him tomake a statement stressing the defensive aspect of the programme.  He had  done so in order not to give Herr Hitler an opportunity of going back on his word; buthe feared that he had given  the impression that British policy had changed inthis respect.   The French Government,  however,  need  not  fear;  though  HisMajesty&apos;s Government had not said so, they were  in fact increasing their bombingforce in the same measure as their fighting force.  Indeed, it was possible thatthey might presently  increase the emphasis  on the  bombing side  of their programme.     M.  DALADIER admitted that in fact the French Government and Frenchtechnicians had been deceived, and at one moment they were genuinely anxious;for, as  stated above, the French view was that, in order to be able to parry  aGerman attack, it was essential to have a strong bombing  force. Germany hadnot  slowed down  her re-armament since  the Munich agreement.   Factories inGermany were continuing to increase their output  in  the proportion of threebombers to one fighter.   Germany had had to improvise her Army after 1918, andthose irf command were accordingly less inclined than their opposite numbers inFrance  and Great Britain to have regard for tradition; and their re-armamenthad been based ou the  view that,  to destroy  the morale^-of  the enemy,  it  was essential to have  a  strong force of bombers.  About a week before, a Frenchaviator, one of the best specialists in the French Air Force, had returned  fromGermany, where the  German  Air Force, with whom he was on the best of terms,had allowed him  to pilot some of their most modern aeroplanes, no doubt partly to impress him. This airman had returned with the conviction that in the Germanview bombing aircraft was the most important weapon.  M. Daladier said that
 it seemed to him that the result of their  present exchange of views was that technical discussions between British and French experts should be pressed  on. There Was no need to give the appearance of aggressive intentions, but it was essential that there should be regular contacts.     MR, CHAMBERLAIN said that  His Majesty&apos;s Government would gladly agree to the eontinuation of the valuable contacts which had already taken place. They need not give rise to any display, but it would  be possible to get what was wanted without that.    * M.  DALADIER agreed that there was no need for anything spectacular. It. was siriiply a question of an exchange  of  views  between a few  well-chosen experts.  As regards land  armaments, he  said  that he understood  perfectly Mr.  Chamberlain&apos;s argument  that it  was not yet  possible  for  His Majesty&apos;s Government to make any very great effort  in  this direction; but he  hoped, that it might be possible to arrange, without any  unnecessary publicity, for expert discussions to be continued, by which it might be found possible for Great Britain to despatch two divisions to France at least as early  as the eighth day after the outbreak of hostilities.     MR. CHAMBERLAIN agreed  that further talks should take place. Jewish Question.  -     M. BONNET said that the French  Government were much preoccupied with the question of Jewish  immigration into  France, particularly since  the latest German measures against Jews.   The French Government had not prohibited the entry of a certain number of Jews, although there were  already  40,000 Jewish refugees in France.   The French practice was to  give visas  for France to those Jews who were in danger of death  if they remained in Germany. But France could not stand a new  Jewish immigration on a  large scale.  She was already saturated with foreigners, of whom there were about 3 million in the country. As undertaken at the Conference of Evian, the French Government were seeking a solution of this problem, but they had not yet found any means&apos; whereby any further considerable number of refugees might be settled in  French territory. As everyone knew, there had been a distinct movement on the part of United States opinion and particularly the United States, press, but this had not been followed by any precise acts, and recently Mr. Sumner Welles had, on the part  of the United  States, only been able to. suggest that certain  immigrants already  in the United  States might be allowed to  have visas to  enable  them to  stay there. The French Government were willing to consider  the possibility of establishing a number of Jewish refugees in a French colony, and they  might allow a few more to  enter  France from Germany;  but  such action on their  part  must  be accompanied by similar efforts on the part of Great Britain and the United States.     MR. CHAMBERLAIN said that  His  Majesty&apos;s Government were  most anxious to help; and that they had already taken this matter up with the colonies and dominions.  One of the chief difficulties, however, was the serious danger  of arousing anti-Semitic feeling in Great Britain. Indeed, a number of Jews had begged His Majesty&apos;s Government not  to  advertise too prominently what  was being done.  For the information of the French Government,  he wished to say that at present 500 Jewish immigrants a week were being admitted  into the United  Kingdom.    As  regards  the dominions, Australia was taking quite a considerable number, one by one, and without any publicity, for the reasons given above.  In addition, though they recognised that the  introduction of  individual refugees into settled territory was easier than their introduction into territory whi^h had not yet been settled, His Majesty&apos;s Government had communicated with the Governors of certain British colonies in this matter, and they had been able to give a; not unhelpful  account of their efforts to  Parliament.  It seemed likely, that&apos;, the: proposed settlement would be particularly successful  in  Tanganyika,which was willing to admit a certain number of Jews.   The action: taken by HisMajesty&apos;s Government in this connexion; had been welcomed in that  colony; he: must say that it had not been welcomed in Berlin.  There was a possibility of : settlement elsewhere in Africa, but the most hopeful territory seemed to be British Guiana, where there was: a  large tract  suitable for settlement by white people;unlike many other British and French colonies. J The territory in British Guiana
consisted largely of open land with grass and some  forest, though not so muchforest as to make it necessary to undertake extensive works of clearing.  It was some way from the sea, and the fact that it was lacking in means of com muni ca-tion had resulted in its not being settled before.  It would be suitable for agricul-tural  settlement only, and  consisted of some 10.000 square miles  or more.   IfJewish  organisations wished to send  representatives to inspect the land, HisMajesty&apos;s Government would be willing to give them every help of  a technicalkind,  and if they  approved of the territory, His  Majesty&apos;s Government, while retaining nominal freehold, would offer it to them on terms which would cost themalmost  nothing.   The  Jewish organisations,  however, must  find  the  moneynecessary for the development of the territory.  Mr. Chamberlain said that hewas not hopeful of assistance from the  United States  Government,  but  it waspossible that the Jews in America might help.  The important point, however,was that the Jews needed immediate help and colonial settlement could  hardlygive this.  In the circumstances, it was necessary to demonstrate the possibilityof a big scheme, and meanwhile to give temporary refuge  to Jewish emigrantswhere they could live and be maintained by fellow Jews until it was  possible tosettle them  in the territory chosen.   There was  another  point.  The  FrenchGovernment knew  that  the German Government made it as difficult as possiblefor the  Jews to emigrate normally.  If  the German Government were to allow them  to take out even a portion of their property,  it  would  greatly facilitatematters. Hitherto the German Government had been  deaf to all  such suggestions,but he  wondered whether it would be possible for  the French Government toexercise some beneficial influence over Herr von Ribbentrop when he came to paris, with a view to a relaxation of these restrictions.   If the  German govern -ment  were adamant, they might at least allow such  property as was  left to theJews in Germany,  after the collective fine, to be earmarked for the establishmentof refugees outside Germany.    M.  BONNET said that he noted  Mr. ChamberlahVs suggestions, and thatthe French Government would be only too  pleased  if tlhey could  exercise suchinfluence as he described upon Herr von Ribbentrop. As a result of a conversation which Herr von Ribbentrop had had with the French, British and United StatesAmbassadors in Berlin, it was  clear  that the German aim was to  get rid ofthe Jews and that in their view the question of emigration must be settled  as soonas  possible.   There  was  also  the  possibility of  meeting in Holland  withMr. Rublee and a representative of the  German Government to study the questionof  the  establishment of Jewish  refugees abroad.   Perhaps then,  or on  somesubsequent occasion,  it might be possible to persuade the German Government to relax  their restrictions  in the manner suggested, or to facilitate in some other way the establisment of the German Jews outside Germany.  M. Bonnet addedthat it was also possible to appeal to South American Republics  to help, in which case it might be advisable to obtain President Roosevelt&apos;s support.                   (The meeting  adjourned at 12-30 P.M.)                    SECOND MEETING, AT 2-45 P.M.Franco-Italian Relations.                                       -    M. BONNET said that after the Munich Agreement, the French Governmenthad attempted to normalise their relations with Italy by sending an ambassador to Rome, accredited to the King of Italy and Emperor of Ethiopia.  They had asked for nothing in return, and they had had hopes of an improvement of the irrelations.  The Italian press, however, had not been very friendly.  Count Cianohad told M. Frangois-Poncet that  there was no fundamental difference between france and Italy, but there was a question separating  them, and that was Spain.M. Bonnet asked what were the views of His Majesty&apos;s Government with regardto the situation in Spain.
lb   V&apos; MR. CHAMBERLAIN  said  that he had noted with concern the attitudeof the Italian press.  It was interesting that, while the German press had becomepro-French and anti-British, the Italian press was pro-British and anti-French.The principal difficulty was no doubt Spain.  Developments in that country werepuzzling, and information received from Mr. Hemming was not at all encouraging.General Franco was asking for belligerent  rights before he  would agree to thewithdrawal of foreign volunteers, whereas, according to the Non-interventionCommittees  decision, the withdrawal Of volunteers should precede the granting of  belligerent  rights.   His  Majesty&apos;s  Government  were, not prepared  tocountenance this, and it was difficult to see how progress could be made.  In spiteof much thought, they had not been able to produce any plan. Mr. Chamberlainsaid that the Spanish conflict would probably drag on for some time yet before anydecisive result was achieved.  It was also conceivable that Signor Mussolini might say that, as General Franco&apos;s victory was delayed, he considered himself released from his obligations.  If His Majesty&apos;s Government  could influence Italy in anyway, it  would be in order to prevent such an eventuality; but they had no definiteplan at present and they had to await events.     M.  BONNET agreed  that it would  not  be possible to accede to general franco&apos;s demand.   He asked  whether  an effort might not be made to persuadeGeneral Franco to send away his foreign volunteers.   He was frequently givinginterviews in  which he declared that he had no need for the volunteers and thathe was  ready to withdraw them.   In  view of the acquiescence of the SpanishGovernment  in the  proposal  of the non-Intervention Committee, there reallyshould be no difficulty for General Franco to withdraw his volunteers now.     MR. CHAMBERLAIN said that that was precisely what Mr. Hemming hadhope to persuade General Franco  to do, but he  had  not met  with much success,and  His Majesty&apos;s Government could  not see  that  there was anything else tobe done at present.   They  considered  that  relations between  them  and theNationalist authorities had improved since  the  appointment  of  a British agent-at Burgos.   Mr. Chamberlain enquired whether  the French Government had thought of taking similar action.  His Majesty&apos;s Government had appointed an agent on commercial grounds, particularly in view of the fact that without suchan agent it was not possible for them to protest against harm frequently done to British commercial  interests in  Nationalist Spain.  In  view of criticismsfrom the Left Wing in Great Britain, they had based their action On commercialrather than on political grounds.                                          1:o   &apos;.  M.  BONNET said that  the French Government had thought of this at thetime of the  plan of the London Committee. It was not easy for them to do so,however, in view of the  fact that  the  plan  had been accepted by  the BarcelonaGovernment and rejected by General Franco.  The position was, therefore difficult and  for the moment they could only await events.     MR. CHAMBERLAIN  said  that the  possibility of making any  progressdepended on the attitude of Italy.   He asked  whether there  was any possibilityof an agreement being reached between Italy, France and Great Britain containing a plan for the further withdrawal of volunteers. Signor Mussolini had informed him  at Munich that he was tired of supporting General Franco; and there seemedto be some hopes, if  a plan could be drawn up, whereby the three Powers should agree on a  new method of evacuating the foreign  volunteers.     M.   BONNET  said that- if  such  a . plan  really  made  the  withdrawal of volunteers possible, the French Government would have no difficulties with publicopinion in France.   It had always been considered in France that the SpanishHvar  was an affair for Spaniards,  and  he did&apos; not contemplate any difficulties ifthe volunteers were really withdrawn.  Herr Hitler  had spoken to M. Francois-Pohcet  quite reasonably on this subject before the latter left Germany!  Indeed,Herr Hitler had been more reasonable than the Italian Government.  His view had  been, that the Spanish war should be settled by the  Spaniards themselves, andthat the volunteers should be withdrawn.         ;                     &apos;     MR, CHAMBERLAIN said that Herr Hifler had told him that there werefewr  Germans in Spain and  that  if other  countries, withdrew their volunteers,he would withdraw his.   &apos;
    M.  DALADIER asked whether it would not be a good idea to invite thetwo sides in Spain  to conclude an armistice.    LORD  HALIFAX asked whether General Franco  would agree to such aproposal.                       &apos;                       .,    \    MR. CHAMBERLAIN said  that His Majesty&apos;s Government  were very anxious that  the  wiaiv should  be  brought  to  an  end but that  their present,information was that General Franco was confident and would not entertain theidea of an  armistice.  General Franco  considered  that  if  he were  grantedbelligerent rights  he would be able  to starve the  other side  out.  It  wasconceivable,  however, that  he might later on be willing  to accept an armistice.    M.  DALADIER said that, according to French  information, the  SpanishGovernment were  experiencing difficulties with regard to supplies for  the civilpopulation and part of the army.   It seemed,  however,  that Sr.  Negrin, byexploiting xenophobe feeling and representing General Franco as fighting with german help against his own country, bad succeeded in improving the morale ofthe inhabitants of Government  Spain.   His information was that  on  general franco&apos;s side  the situation was better, but not universally so.   Many supporters of General Franco cordially disliked the Italians, and there were reported to bedifferences in the Nationalist camp.  M.  Daladier believed that  if it were possibleto stop the war for a week  there would  be no more fighting, and he thought that,in that event, there was  a possibility of  arbitration by Spaniards who  had remained neutral  or had  played no  very  prominent part,  and he wondered whether it would not be a very good idea to suggest an armistice.  It might wellbe asked whether, the two sides would agree, but  the French Government  hadreceived information that  neither side  liked fighting  against  fellow-Spaniards,and that enthusiasm was decreasing.  To suggest an armistice might be a greatcontribution to the cause of peace.  French public opinion was very sensitive toevents in Spain, and reliable local opinion near the Franco-Spanish frontier wasto the effect that,  once an armistice were reached, there  would be no more war.There might be a  monarchist restoration of some kind, or there might be  a pro-visional Government of neutral  persons; but anything was more  likely  than the victory of one side, which could only result in more trouble in Spain.   If the warcontinued through  the winter, then  it  would  certainly continue until next summer.  As regards Signor Mussolini, M. Daladier confessed  that he could not understand  his attitude. If he wanted nothing from Spain, M. Daladier  asked,why did he continue to send war  material  to General  Franco?  He-wondered whether Signor Mussolini had not some arriere-pensee for example, a free portin the Balearic Islands.  He asked what His Majesty&apos;s  Government thought ofthe possibility of suggesting an  armistice to the two sides in Spain.    MR. CHAMBERLAIN thought that it would be difficult for General Francoto accept an armistice if proposed by Great Britain or France, or by both countriestogether.   He asked whether  it would not be  possible for  the four Powersrepresented  at Munich to make the approach.   Signor Mussolini had  told  him that he  would consider the matter; but  no progress  seemed to have been made sofar.  He suggested that M. Bonnet might speak about it to Herr von  Ribbentrop.    M.  DALADIER said that much  virtue seemed to be attributed  to Herr von ribbentrop.   As  regards  Signor Mussolini, the truth  was that he said thathe only  had one difference with France, and that was that he desired, the victory of General  Franco.   At the same time  he had said that he disapproved ofsoldiers who made  insurrections.   M.  Daladier  wondered  what would  be the reaction of Signor Mussolini if  the French  Government  were  to insist upon thenecessity for the victory of Sr. Negrin.  The French Government wished to  leave the spaniards to settle their own differences. They had done something&quot;difficult whenthey had^ closed the Franco-Spanish frontier.  They had not been obliged to do&quot; so and their action had not helped  the Spanish Government. Yet Signor mussolini had only taken advantage of their  action.    MR. CHAMBERLAIN  said that he had suggested  an armistice to  signor mussolini at  Munich, but  that his suggestion had  evoked  no  response.  HisMajesty&apos;s Government might approach Italy  on the subject  again.   In their view, it was no use  proposing an armistice without prior  understanding with
Italy.  It would certainly be no good doing so if the Italian Government opposedit.  If, however, they agreed to raise  no objection, His Majesty&apos;s  Governmentwould  gladly join the French Government in suggesting an armistice in Spain.  ,  M. BONNET emphasised the necessity of putting the question of withdrawalof volunteers to^General Franco.  He repeated that General Franco was  always;saying he did not need the  volunteers; once  he had withdrawn them he mightbe granted belligerent rights.   : MR. CHAMBERLAIN  said that His Majesty&apos;s Government would be glad to discuss this  question with the Italian Government.Czechoslovakia and Central  Europe.  &apos;  M. BONNET said the  first question with regard to Czechoslovakia waswhen the guarantee of the new  Czechoslovak frontiers  was to  come into effect.This question was the more urgent in that events in Ruthenia seemed to indicatethat the Vienna Agreement was not  necessarily  a lasting  one.  The FrenchGovernment had received  information  that Hungary, with the  implicit consentof Poland, was massing troops on the  Ruthenian frontier, and  it seemed likely that very soon  the world would  be  faced with  new events in that area.  KingCarol had  told him that he believed that these events would take place in thenear future and that  he believed that  one means of avoiding them would be togive some assurance as regard the Czechoslovak frontier.    LORD HALIFAX said  that King  Carol had made the same  point in London,and- had emphasised  the  unsettled conditions  in  South-East Europe and theimportance of exerting a  steadying  influence.  King Carol had also discussed with His Majesty&apos;s Government  the form of  the guarantee of the Czechoslovakfrontiers, and the Powers by  whom the guarantee was to be assumed.  King Carolhad been strongly of opinion that Germany would not participate in a guaranteeif Russia were in any way  involved, by separate  instrument or not;  and that so far as he was concerned, if he had to choose, he would choose  Germany ratherthan Russia as a guarantor.  His  Majesty&apos;s Government had agreed,  though they had reminded His Majesty that the Anglo-French Plan of the 19th Septemberhad postulated the inclusion of Russia among the guarantors.   It was necessaryto. discover whether Russia  would be  willing to  give  a guarantee,  and, if so,whether  Czechoslovakia would accept it.  King Carol had thought that theguarantee should be given by the four Munich Powers (this  was  also  signor mussolini&apos;s opinion).  His Majesty&apos;s Government felt, however,  that if Germanyrefused to  give  a guarantee because Russia was a guarantor, then  it would benecessary to choose Germany rather  than  Russia.     M. DALADIER  agreed that it would be necessary to discover what  werethe views of the Czechoslovak Government,  but it was  important not to forgetthat there had been a  reorientation of Czechoslovak policy.     LORD HALIFAX said that His  Majesty&apos;s Governments  information wasthat Czechoslovakia might prefer not to have the Russian guarantee.     M. DALADIER said that, however that might be, it must  not be France orGreat Britain  who were held responsible.   If Czechoslovakia  did  not want a russian guarantee, all well and good,  but His Majesty&apos;s Government, andparticularly France, could not take the responsibility of  excluding Russia.  Itmust not be forgotten that there was a Russo-Czechoslovak treaty of guaranteewhich was subordinated to the Franco-Czechoslovak treaty.  On the other hand,France would  not  impose a Russian  guarantee on  Czechoslovakia,  But theFrench Government could  not take the  responsibility of telling Russia that  theirguarantee  was not  wanted.   He had so  informed King Carol.   It  was  for the czechoslovak Government to say by whom they wished to be guaranteed; and ifthey wished to be guaranteed by Russia,  the French Government would not stopthem.   It  seemed &quot;necessary to  ask the Czechoslovak  Government what they wanted:  -      &apos;-      -    &quot;- &apos;          &apos;:&apos;-^:r  -                      .-.   :  i     LORD HALIFAX said that His  Majesty&apos;s.Government wondered whetherthe French Government could ascertain the Soviet Governments feelings in this;matter;  while&quot; His  Majesty&apos;s Government  would  ascertain the feeling of the czechoslovak Government.          /                       &apos;             ;&quot;
    M. BONNET asked whether it would riot be. simpler for the four Powers togive the guarantee.  That would not hinder the French Government from asking&apos;Russia for her views.                                                 &apos;--   &quot;    M. DALADIER repeated that it was for the Czechoslovak Government todecide.    MR.  CHAMBERLAIN said that it seemed to him that if the czechoslovak government were approached and they said that they did not desire a Russianguarantee, there would be no necessity to ask for Russia&apos;s opinion; that would bemuch easier for everyone.                                             &apos;  &quot;    M. DALADIER agreed.    MR.  CHAMBERLAIN said that it seemed that Czechoslovakia now desiredto be on  good terms with Germany.  If the Czechoslovak Government thoughtthat a Russian guarantee would offend Germany, they would not want it.    M. DALADIER agreed.    LORD  HALIFAX said  that  if the Czechoslovak Government were to beasked by which Great  Powers  they wished  to  be guaranteed, what would theFrench Government think  of the proposal that the Czechoslovak  Governmentshould be asked  if they  also  wished  for guarantees from their  neighbours.King  Carol  had suggested  that Czechoslovakia&apos;s neighbours might guarantee a portion of the Czechoslovak frontiers.    M.  DALADIER  agreed.   King  Carol,  he  said,   wished  for  a doubleguarantee.  His Majesty had suggested that the four Western Powers shouldguarantee the new frontiers of Czechoslovakia, including the Hungarian frontier,and that Roumania should guarantee the Czechoslovak-Hungarian frontier  only.    M. BONNET said that the French Government would be perfectly willing&apos;to approach the Czechoslovak  Government; but he wondered whether they wouldnot have difficulties with  Germany and Italy,  who might not  wish to give aguarantee until they knew whether the Vienna Agreement was final.    MR.  CHAMBERLAIN agreed that this was very possible.    M. BONNET suggested that the Czechoslovak Government should now beasked for their views and that they might be told that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentand the French Government were willing to give guarantees.    LORD  HALIFAX  said  that the  Czechoslovak  Government  should  beinformed that France and  Great Britain were willing to give guarantees,  withGermany and Italy.    M. BONNET assented, but asked whether Germany and Italy were preparedto give guarantees.  He suggested that the Czechoslovak Government might beasked without awaiting the views of the German and Italian Governments.  the czechoslovak Government might first be asked for their views with regard toguarantees from the four Munich Powers, and then for their views with regard toguarantees by Russia and their neighbours.    MR.  CHAMBERLAIN said that  His Majesty&apos;s Government had receivedsuggestions  from the Czechoslovak Government that they would like to receivethe guarantee as soon as possible.  It might be advisable to ask them what sort of guarantee they desired; though they should not be pressed to ask for a Russianguarantee.    M. DALADIER agreed.    MR. CHAMBERLAIN said that it would be preferable if the CzechoslovakGo prnment acted in this matter on their &apos;wn initiative.    M. DALADIER agreed. .                     .                       ,    M. BONNET said, that the French Government would approach the Czeeho-slovak Government at  the same time.   They had also been pressed by the czechoslovak Government for a guarantee.&apos;                      ^   ..    LORD  HALIFAX  said there was one. further point.: if  and  when  theguarantee were to be given by the four Munich Powers, His Majesty&apos;s.Government.considered  that their obligations  should  be drawn so  as to make it a  joint guarantee.  The obligations should come into force in the  case of unprovoked
aggression with regard to which each signatory would judge for himself, and theguarantee would only come into force as a result of a decision by three  of thefour Powers.    M. BONNET complained that that reduced the value of the guarantee.    MR. CHAMBERLAIN said that it was too dangerous so to arrange theguarantee that it might happen  that France and Great Britain would have to gpto war because of action on the part of the other two guarantors.  The stipulationthat the guarantee would only come into force as a result of a decision by three off the four Powers would protect France and Great Britain from such a risk:The value of the guarantee was to serve as a deterrent; and as a deterrent a three-Power guarantee was more effective than a guarantee of two Powers.    M. DALADIER objected  that in  actual  fact there would  never be  three powers against one, but always four against none, or two against two.    MR. CHAMBERLAIN said that he could not agree.  The interests of Italyand Germany in Central Europe were  not necessarily always the same,  and a situation was possible in which  Italy  might warn Germany that in tJie event ofGerman aggression against Czechoslovakia, Italy, by siding with France andGreat Britain, might bring the guarantee into force.    M. BONNET asked whether it was permissible to introduce a new conditionof this sort.    MR,  CHAMBERLAIN  said  that  it had  never  been suggested that theguarantee should be unconditional, and  that hitherto  the manner in which theguarantee would be brought into operation had been unspecified.  His Majesty&apos;sGovernment had always informed Parliament that the French Government mustbe consulted in this matter.    M. BONNET said  that a typical international guarantee was the locarno treaty, a joint and several guarantee.   Under such a Treaty if one guarantorrefused to fulfil his obligations  that did not liberate the other guarantors fromfulfilling theirs.    MR. CHAMBERLAIN said that His Majesty&apos;s Government could not accept such a guarantee in the case of Czechoslovakia.    M. DALADIER said that in that  case it would have been better not to under-take a guarantee like that undertaken  at Munich.    MR. CHAMBERLAIN said that it did not seem to him that a guaranteeby His Majesty&apos;s Government alone was worth very much.    M. DALADIER agreed.  He recalled that when it had been decided thatthe Sudeten minority should be separated from Czechoslovakia and that the newCzechoslovakia should  principally consist  of the Czech and Slovak majorities,Great Britain and France had  at once offered to guarantee the new  frontiers.Germany, and Italy had only undertaken to do so in the event of  the  wholequestion of frontiers being finally settled.  M. Daladier asked whether there hadnot been a speech by Sir Thomas Inskip  to the effect that the  guarantee hadalready been given.    MR. CHAMBERLAIN said that the guarantee was not technically givenuntil  a Treaty to that effect was signed between the United Kingdom and Czecho-slovakia.  Till then His Majesty&apos;s Government were under a moral obligation.This was very unsatisfactory, and a precise text would  be preferable.*   M. DALADIER said that, according to  the  reasoning of  His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, if the guarantee were only to come into operation if at least ,three off the guarantors decided to honour their obligations, it would be to the interestof Czechoslovakia to ask for a Russian  guarantee as well, thus making five possibleguarantors.    MR. CHAMBERLAIN said that that did not follow.  The choice might wellnot. lie  between  five or  four  guarantors.  . Germany might  refuse to guaranteeCzechoslovakia if Russia were asked.to do so.
   -  M.  DALADIER complained  that FrancewasI in&apos;  a very r difficult moral position. At Munich the French Government had accepted the separation of the Sudeten populations from Czechoslovakia, their view being that President Benes had not been capable of  forming a federal State.   To do so had not been easy fOr the French G-overnsaent.  Since  that time events had moved more rapidly than had been foreseen, and the actual map of Czechoslovakia was a much more serious thing than the Godesberg  map.   Although  the Czechs had  not raised  much Objection, they had, in fact, ceded very much more than had been agreed upon at Munich.  If France were now to refuse to guarantee what remained of Czecho- slovakia, her position would be still worse.     LORD  HALIFAX said that  he  appreciated  the  emphasis  laid  by- M. Daladier on the moral position  but he did not think himself that the question was well posed in those terms.  According to the wording of the Anglo-French plan submitted to the Czechoslovak  Government the guarantee of the new Czeeho- slovak frontiers was to be a general guarantee.   There Was no precise definition of the nature of the guarantee.  It  seemed to him open to His Majesty&apos;s  Govern- ment and the French Government to maintain that  the guarantee was strictly a joint one, and that it should not operate unless all but one of the guarantors were prepared to act.   This did not seem to be out of conformity with the letter of the Anglo-French declaration.     M.  BONNET  said that that might be so, but it was hardly in  conformity with the spirit.     MR. CHAMBERLAIN asked  what precisely was M. Bonnet&apos;s idea of the nature of the guarantee  to be given.     M.  BONNET  said that it was his impression that what was expected was a guarantee by each State individually, as in the Treaty of Locarno. At the time of the Anglo-French  plan the Czechoslovak Government had been led to believe that, while, up till then,  they had  only had French and Russian guarantees, in future they would have the  British  guarantee  as well.     MR. CHAMBERLAIN said that that was true, but that they were  then thinking of general  guarantees,  more effective than the  limited  guarantees which they had replaced. His Majesty&apos;s Government  had had no intention of taking on a liability in Central Europe which might fall on them alone.     M.  DALADIER asked whether it was realised that  the French guarantee would be merged  into  a  general guarantee, and that  therefore its  importance would be diminished; or whether,  it was considered that  the French guarantee would continue to have the same value.     MR. CHAMBERLAIN said that the general value would be more while the individual value would be less.     M. LEGER suggested that, if the new guarantee was only:to come into force if three of the four guarantors were prepared to act, the French guarantee would, in fact, be worth less:                   ...     MR. CHAMBERLAIN said that His Majesty&apos;s Government had had  in mind the fact that the  liability would be less.  Czechoslovakia would be in less danger, as the cause of danger had largely been removed.     M. DALADIER once again explained the considerations which had led the French Government to accept the dismemberment of Czechoslovakia and to offer to guarantee the new Czechoslovak frontier.  Lie recalled again that&apos;Germany and Italy had subordinated  their offer of a guarantee to certain &quot;conditions which had now been  fulfilled:  It  seemed  to him  that,  if  France were to accept His Majesty&apos;s Government^ proposal, she would be going, back on the position which she had  taken up at Munich.  France  had offered to guarantee the new frontier in order to  make it easier for the  Czechoslovak  Government to accept the  new frontier, which would be. a really national one. He repeated that His Majesty&apos;s Government  and  the French Government had not  imposed  any   conditions.Moreover, Italy and Germany had accepted to give individual guarantees.
     MR.  CHAMBERLAIN said that he did not understand that the guarantees to be given by Germany and Italy should be individual and.separate, but merelyi that, when the Polish and Hungarian questions were, settled, Germany and Italy would give some sort of guarantee.  He had contemplated that after the negotia- tions the  situation of Czechoslovakia would  be one of almost complete  safety. The guarantee had only been in the nature of an extra assurance to the somewhat suspicious Czechs, and if Germany and Italy were brought into the guarantee that might make it difficult for them to absorb what remained of Czechoslovakia. He repeated that he had never conceived of a situation in  which Great Britain might have to carry out her obligations alone.     M.  DALADIER  again complained  that  France was in a very  difficult position.   She had guaranteed Czechoslovakia individually against unprovoked aggression.  That was why  France had mobilised,  fearing a  coup  de force by Germany  against Czechoslovakia.  He feared that it would have a very adverse effect upon France&apos;s position if she were now  to say that her new guarantee was subordinated to certain conditions.  In any case, he did not see how in practice/ the situation could arise in which the guarantee would be brought into operation. Czechoslovakia was already in the wake of Germany and governing circles in Prague were Germanophil.  But he was also looking at the  question from the moral point of view.     LORD HALIFAX said that it was also  a practical question.  He fully realised the j ustice of the French arguments, but there was  perhaps some danger in establishing a position where a future  Czechoslovak Government might look to France and Great  Britain  for support in pursuing a policy not entirely in conformity with German  wishes.  That would constitute  a certain element of provocation to Germany; and  France and Great Britain would be powerless to: intervene.  In September the French Government and His Majesty&apos;s  Government had been faced with a position  of great difficulty because nothing which they could do  would really help Czechoslovakia.   It was essential  that a  repetition of this should be avoided for, in the future, France and Great Britain would be in a far worse position.  The Czechoslovak army had diminished in importance and there was to be  an important German road  across Czechoslovak territory. It was difficult to see how, in the circumstances, France and Great Britain could implement their guarantee, and it would be humiliating for them not to be able to do so.  The question must be regarded  from the practical point of view.  Lord Halifax asked whether the French Government had any suggestion which would meet the practical difficulty.     M. DALADIER  agreed that  practical considerations should be borne in mind.   The new  Czechoslovakia could  do nothing  without  the  agreement of Germany and, practically speaking, the guarantee of her frontiers would never have to come into force. Recently, when Czechoslovakia had wished her difficulties with Poland and  Hungary to be solved Germany and Italy had been asked to arbitrate.   Great  Britain and France had not been asked.  A guarantee would be of no practical importance, but its moral importance would be considerable in the United Kingdom as well as in France.     MR.  CHAMBERLAIN asked whether the result of the  discussion  so far had not been to indicate  that the  working of the  guarantee in the event of unprovoked aggression by Germany or her satellites against  Czechoslovakia could not, in fact, help the latter country.  In the circumstances the best way to handle the problem would be through Prague. If the Czechoslovak Government accepted the arrangement which His Majesty&apos;s  Government had proposed,  it  seemed to him that that would satisfy all parties.  From the Czechoslovak point of view it would certainly be better to  have a guarantee which would  bring in Germany and Italy willingly rather than a  sham guarantee which could not work if it were really wanted.     M. DALADIER  agreed  that  the  Czechoslovak Government  should be approached in the sense suggested. Roumania.    .M. BONNET said that he wished to speak about the question of the raising of the status of the French Legation at Bucharest, about which he had already spoken to  Lord  Halifax.  From tfhe French point of view,  the establishment of
an  Embassy  at Bucharest  could be most useful.   In any case it was necessaryfor the French Government  to act rapidly in this  matter  since they bad  just received news that the German Government intended to create an Embassy atBucharest very shortly.  M. Bonnet wished to come to some agreement with HisMajesty&apos;s Government. on  this point.                      :    LORD HALIFAX said that he was very grateful to M. Bonnet for consultingHis Majesty&apos;s Government in this matter.  It was a not  unfamiliar.: question and it was  one which  raised great  difficulties for His  Majesty&apos;s  Government.While tihe possibility of raising the status of His Majesty&apos;s Legation at Bucharestto that of an Embassy had a certain attraction, he felt bound to say  there; were strong objections to such a course.  If His Majesty&apos;s Government were to yieldto the charms of  Bucharest, they would have to take similar action at Belgradeand Athens.  They had, however, already declined to raise the status of  HisMajesty&apos;s Missions at The Hague, Tehran and Lima on the grounds That  theycould not create any more Embassies.  It was therefore difficult for them to raisethe status of His Majesty&apos;s  Mission at&apos;Bucharest.    M. DALADIER said  that whatever France  and Great Britain did in  thismatter, there was no doubt that Germany, and  also Italy, would shortly raisethe status of their missions at Bucharest.   That being so, it would be regrettableif France,  by delaying now, were once again  to act too late.  In reply to an enquiry from Lord Halifax as to whether  the  French Government had actuallydecided what they intended to do, M. Daladier said that they had almost decidedbut they did not wish to take any definite action until they had spoken to  HisMajesty&apos;s Government.  M. Daladier himself had decided,  a  month previously,.that the status of the French Legation  at  Bucharest should be raised and,  that being so, he  was averse to letting Germany and Italy act first, since, in  that case, the effect of the French decision would  be entirely spoiled, and it would evokeno gratitude on the part of Roumania.  He had not spoken to King Carol about this during His Majesty&apos;s visit to Paris;  but  while he  recognised the validity of Lord Halifax&apos;s arguments, the raising  of the status of the French Legationat Bucharest was inevitable.    LORD HALIFAX asked whether the  French Government could delay their final decision for two or three weeks in  order to give His Majesty&apos;s Governmenttime to decide finally themselves.  If finally the two Governments were not&apos; inagreement, it would be open to each of them to come to a  decision independently;but it seemed desirable to him that France and Great Britain should move together in this matter.    M. DALADIER said that he  feared  that a delay  of  two or three weekswould be too long. As he had already explained, France did not  wish tp  loseany advantages  which  might  accrue  from  her  decision.   There  was  alsoRoumania&apos;s behaviour during the recent crisis to be considered.  She had beenvery loyal.   It was in any case for France to take the. initiative in this matterand not Germany.    LORD HALIFAX said that in the circumstances His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwould not wish to stand in the way of the French Government.  He asked whetherthe French Government were considering  the  possibility of raising  the  status of their mission at Athens.    M. DALADIER said that they were not and that for  the moment theyonly intended to raise the status of their Legation at Bucharest.Franco-Russian Relations.    MR. CHAMBERLAIN said that he would like  to ask one or two questions about  Franco-Polish and Franco-Russian relations.  There had been indications that there might be in the  minds of  the German  Government an idea that theycould  begin the disruption of Russia by the encouragement of agitation for anindependent Ukraine.  There was no question of the German Government takingmilitary action.  It was more subtle  than that.  But if there were any  truth inthese  rumours it  would  be unfortunate if France should one  day find herselfentangled as a consequence of her relations with Russia.   He asked whether theFrench Government had.given consideration to this point,  , ::
    M. BONNET said that the.information of the French Government was thatthere was a certain effervescence  in Ukraine as a result of the recent numerousexecutions in Russia..  There was also, it  seemed, a  possibility of a separatistmovement in Ukraine.  If one read the verbatim reports of the last mass trial at moscow, it was clear  hat one of the principal accusations against the defendantswas that they had attempted to foment separatist movements.  It was, therefore,probable that  such movements existed.   If Russia were unable to repress suchmovements herself, the situation  might become dangerous, but this would be an internal Russian question.    MR. CHAMBERLAIN asked what the position would be if Russia were toask France for assistance on the grounds that a separatist movement in Ukrainewas provoked by Germany.    M. BONNET explained that French obligations  towards Russia only came into force if there were a direct attack by  Germany on Russian territory.    MR. CHAMBERLAIN said that he considered M. Bonnet&apos;s reply entirely satisfactory.Economic A ction in Central Europe.    M. BONNET enquired whether His Majesty&apos;s Government and the FrenchGovernment could record  that they were in  agreement  with regard to theimportance of developing their commercial exchanges with Central Europe andof keeping each other informed of the nature and progress  of  such exchanges,which should not be to the exclusion of either Germany or Italy.    MR. CHAMBERLAIN said  that His  Majesty&apos;s Government would have noobjection.Syria and Palestine.    M. BONNET said that circumstances had compelled the  French Govern-ment  to modify the Franco-Syrian Treaty of  1936 in  such  a way that it was now entirely satisfactory  from the French point of view, and they  intended shortly to submit the  treaty to Parliament for its approval.   The new treaty  modifiedthe statute to some extent,  since France considered that certain  guarantees were necessary in view of the  increasing influence of Germany and Italy in the near east.  They feared that  if the emancipation of Syria was allowed to take placetoo suddenly that country might  fall under German influence.   They must also take into account Turkish  ambitions, which  had been revealed at the end ofSeptember when Turkey no doubt considered  that France  was in  a difficult position.    LORD  HALIFAX  thanked M.  Bonnet  for this  information.   So far asHis Majesty&apos;s  Government were concerned they were delighted, particularly as they hoped  that the approval of the new treaty by the  French parliament might have a sedative effect on Arab opinion.  At the same time he wished toexplain that it was sometimes suggested to His Majesty&apos;s  Government by theirrepresentatives in that part of the world that there was a tendency on the partof French Representatives  there not to collaborate as  closely  as the two Govern-ments were collaborating.  No doubt  the French Representatives sometimes feltsimilarly  about their British colleagues.   Lord Halifax said  that  if  ever theFrench  Government had  cause to complain of the action of  the British Repre-sentaltiyes in those parts, he hoped that they would  let His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment  know. His Majesty&apos;s  Government also hoped that the French Governmentwould help His Majesty&apos;s Government in controlling the Mufti.    M. BOX NET said that as regards relations between the representatives ofFrande  and Great Britain in the Near  East,  the necessary  instructions wouldbe sent to the French Representatives.   As for the Mufti, the. French Governmentunderstood that he was now under very close supervision and that he was seeingno one of any importance.                              ...Far East:&quot;: : . ;        ;??-&apos;   ^u;iji&quot; p;\-&quot;: V                  :         &apos;egypt  ,  M. BONNET said that it was clear:that the situation in the Far East had deteriorated. VThe French Government had  tried to  obtain  the support of theUnited,,States Government, but the only common action wb ich  had been taken
was in connexion with representations about navigation on the Yangtze.&quot; Theyhad attempted to obtain  the  support of  the United States  Government afterPrince Konoye&apos;s  declaration,  but nothing had yet transpired.  If the FrenchGovernment and  the United States  Government could take up a  firm attitude in the Far East, it might be possible to achieve some results.&apos;  As  it was events in the Far East  could &quot;mot fail to affect all  European Countries.   Count Cianohad recently admitted that even Germany and Italy were losing all their influence in that area.     MR. CHAMBERLAIN said that he regretted that he could not  add anythingencouraging to what M. Bonnet had said.  If the United States had been preparedto take common  action something  might have been done; but His  Majesty&apos;sGovernment had  also been unsuccessful in eliciting  the support of the UnitedStates Government, who had so far  done  little beyond discouraging the sale ofarms to Japan and lending a certain amount of money to China for the purchaseof wheat.  It  was true  that they had asked His Majesty&apos;s Government if theyhad any  views on the possibility of retaliation in the event of a negative replybeing received to the three-Power demarche  about navigation on  the Yangtze,but they  had made no proposals of their own.  The very fact that they had askedfor the suggestions of  His Majesty&apos;s Government did not indicate  that theyhad any proposals of their own  to  make. In the event of the United  StatesGovernment being prepared to take action, however,  His  Majesty&apos;s Governmentwould consider whether they should  not join them.   His  Majesty&apos;s Governmenthad recently been approached semi-officially by the Chinese Government, who had asked for assistance in  supporting  the Chinese currency.  The only way to do this would be  by guaranteed advances or credits by banks in China, and no verylarge sum would  be required  to keep the currency steady for some time.  HisMajesty&apos;s Government had not yet come to a final decision, but if their decision were favourable  they would enquire whether the United States Government wereprepared to take similar action, which would, of course, increase the value of theirintervention.  No doubt the Japanese Government would regard such action asassistance to their enemies, but they did admit that it was in their own interests that the  Chinese  currency should be maintained.    M. BONNET said that he could see no objection to Flis Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment taking such action if they so desired.    MR.  CHAMBERLAIN repeated that His  Majesty&apos;s Government  had as yet come to no decision on this question.    M.  BONNET  asked whether  there  was any  other measure which  HisMajesty&apos;s Government were contemplating in the Far East.    MR.  CHAMBERLAIN said that there  was not.  To give support  to  theChinese currency  was probably the most effective action that could be taken.  Itwould help China to carry on, and the Chinese Government maintained that, ifthey could continue to hold out,  the Japanese would  eventually be exhausted.Mr. Chamberlain  said that China attached great importance to this measure.Suez  Canal.    M. BONNET said  that he wished to convey a  warning to His Majesty&apos;sGovernment with regard to the Suez  Canal.  The French  Government  hadreceived information that Signor Mussolini had complained that the Suez canal company was administered in such a manner as  to make it a purely Anglo-French concern, and that he was aiming at the appointment of an Italian to  theBoard of the Suez Canal Company.  It would be most inconvenient to the FrenchGovernment if an Italian member were appointed to  the Board, and they hopedthat they might rely on the co-operation  of His Majesty&apos;s Government in  thisquestion.                                                          ;    MR.  CHAMBERLAIN said that for  eighteen years  no official request hadbeen received for  the appointment of an Italian to the Board of the Suez.canal company.  He had, however, heard of Signor Mussolini&apos;s intentions.  On paperItaly had some claim to the appointment of an Italian member.  Italian tonnagepassing through the Canal had greatly increased, and Italy could show quite asgood claims to a directorship as the Netherlands, who were already represented
on the Board and whose tonnage through the Canal was, Mr. Chamberlain under-stood,  less than that of Italy.   He had also heard that the German ambassador in Paris had asked the Marquis de Vogue that a German should be elected to theBoard.  His Majesty&apos;s Government were not anxious for the appointment  of aGerman or  an Italian director,  and they would certainly consult the FrenchGovernment if the question actually arose. It was also possible that Italy mightraise the question of canal dues, though His Majesty&apos;s Government had received no official information on this subject.     M. BONNET said that the  French Government had no  knowledge of anydemarche by  the  German Ambassador  in  Paris in this connexion, but  theypresumed it was an unofficial demarche.Colonies.                                                                  ,     MR. CHAMBERLAIN asked  whether the French Representatives wishedto discuss the question of colonies, regarding which the  British Government hadno proposal  to make.     M. DALADIER said that the French Government similarly &apos;did not wishto make any proposal.  French opinion was unanimously hostile to the cession of colonies to Germany;  moreover, no official demand for colonies had been made tothe French Government by the German  Government.     M.  BONNET  said that  the  French  attitude  was  completely negative.Recently Herr Hitler had informed M. Francois-Poncet, and Herr von Ribbentrophad informed M. Coulondre, that the German Government did not intend to raisethe question.  They had gone so far as to say that it would not be raised for five or six years.     It  was  then agreed to issue a communique, for  the terms  of which see annex B to  this record.               (The proceedings were then closed at 6-15 P.M.)                                ANNEX A.               (Provisional translation from  German original.)                                Declaration.    LE Ministre des Affaires Etrangeres du Reich Allemand et le Ministre des affaires Etrangeres de France,    ont convenu a 1&apos;occasion de leur entrevue a           en date duau nom et d&apos;ordre de leurs Gouvernements de ce qui suit:    10  Le Gouvernement allemand et le Gouvernement francais sont convaincusen pleine  communaute de vues que des relations pacifiques et de bon  voisinageentre 1&apos;Allemagne et  la France  sont l&apos;un des elements  les plus essentiels de  laconsolidation de  la  situation en Europe et du maintien  de la  paix generale.Pour cette raison, les deux Gouvernements s&apos;emploieront de toutes leurs forces a assurer  que les relations entre leurs pays se developpent dans ce sens,    2C  Les  deux Gouvernements constatent  que plus  aucune question  territory-riale ne reste en suspens entre leurs pays et ils reconnaissent solennellement commedefinitive  la f rontiere telle qu&apos;elle se trouve tracee actuellement entre leurs pays.    30  Les  deux Gouvernements soht resolus. sous reserve  de  leurs relationsparticulieres  avec des  tierces Puissances a rester&apos; en  contact  dans  toutes les questions qui interessent leurs deux pays, et a entref en consultations si revolutionde ces questions  devait, a 1&apos;avenir, donner  lieu a des difficultes internationales.

  ,                             : ANNEX B.                               Communique.                                                       November 24, 1938.    THE visit to Par?s of  the British Prime Minister and Secretary of Statefor Foreign  Affairs  has accorded  the  French  Ministers  an  opportunity ofexchanging views with their  British  colleagues  on the principal questions inwhich the two countries have a common concern, including matters of nationaldefence as well as of diplomatic action.    From the discussions which have taken place to-day there has emerged once again complete identity of ideas on the general orientation of the policy of thetwo countries inspired by the same care for the preservation and consolidation ofpeace.
