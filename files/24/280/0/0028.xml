THE BARLEY SITUATION           MEMORANDUM BY T.iE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES           1.         My colleagues will probably be aware that  the           serious fall which has occurred in barley prices during           recent months,  in conjunction with the continued depression           in sheep and lamb prices, has created a situation which           has resulted in mass meetings in Norfolk and a number of           deputations to  me from Members of Parliament and farmers.        -   2.         The position is reviewed in the attached memoranda           which have been prepared in my Department.    There are  two           problems               (i) the case for immediate assistance (see part  III),                     which could only be afforded by some additional                     payment to the industry from the  Exchequer;              (ii) what action, if any,  can be taken with or without                     statutory backing and with or without additional                     Exchequer assistance,  to prevent  the recurrence                     of a  crisis such as has occurred  this year.           3.         As regards the long term problem  I have summoned           a conference of the interests concerned in  the barley trade           to  consider whether agreement can be reached on steps which           could be taken  by the, industry itself (with statutory           backing if necessary) to prevent a recurrence  of these           crisis conditions.    The first meeting of the  conference is       *    taking place on December 8th but the consideration of the           various proposals which will be before them, will           necessarily take time,  and in auy case nothing that  the           conference could recommend can deal with the present situation.-           4.         In these  circumstances I feel that I must  ask my           colleagues as a matter of urgency,  to consider the case  for                                      1.
immediate assistance as examined in part III.   I fully recognise the force of the arguments set out in that document against ad hoc Exchequer assistance.   Nevertheless,I am satisfied that the situation; in Yorkshire and EastAnglla in particular, is such that action should &quot;be taken,and I therefore seek approval in principle to a &quot;distress&quot;grant, as an interim measure to hold the position pendingthe working out and putting into effect of proposalsdesigned to prevent a recurrence of these conditions..5.        If, as I hope, my colleagues feel with me that inthe exceptional circumstances some additional Exchequerassistance should be given, the method which I should recommend is that proposed at the end of Paragraph 24 ofPart III, namely the payment of an arbitrary sum per acrein respect of the acreage of barley that has qualified thisyear for subsidy under the Agriculture Act, 1937.   Thiswill confine the additional subsidy to the cases where it-is most needed, namely to those farmers who are mainly dependenton barley and not on wheat.   There will undoubtedly be .pressure for an extension of the subsidy to all barleygrowers  (and of course an intensification of the demand forfurther assistance to oat growers) but I feel that thisshould be resisted.   It would be necessary, in my view, togive to barley growers who have elected to ,receive the wheatsubsidy instead of oats and barley subsidy an opportunityto reconsider their decision, as indicated in Paragraph 26of Part III.6.        Whether an additional 10s. per acre, making a totalof  1 per acre (as suggested in Part III) would be adequateit is extremely difficult to say having regard to thepolitical, as well as economic, considerations involved.As a rough guide, however, it can be assumed, that thegrower might reasonably have expected to receive about 10s. pecwt. for a crop of ordinary malting barley..   With an average
          yield of 16 cwts* per acre this would bring him a return of           8 pea, acre.   In fact the present average price is 7s. 5d.          per cwt., which with a yield of 17 cwt. per acre brings his          return  to  6, 6s. Od. per acre, a deficiency of  1. 14s. Od.          per acre.   It should he &quot;borne in mind, moreover, that          prices  are still falling.   The subsidy suggested above of           1 per  acre on a restricted acreage would involve          expenditure which would not be likely to exceed  400,000,          which sum would include present commitments of about  100,000.          The proposals of the Conservative Agricultural Committee,          which are for a flat rate subsidy of  1 per acre on all barley          plus a bonus of 5s. per acre to the existing applicants under          the Agriculture Act would involve a total expenditure of           1,038,000 (again including the existing commitments of           100,000).   Sums ranging up to  4 per acre have been  .          suggested by the various deputations which I have received.          On the whole I feel that we should not be justified in          asking parliament for a greater sum than that proposed at  the                                                    -          beginning of this paragraph.          7.        Legislation would, of course, be required, and an          early announcement of the Government1s decision is expected          and desirable.

TEE BARLEY QUESTIONPart I -  Supplies and Price:     1.   Home Production,   Barley is grown to a large extent onthe lighter lands of&quot; the country in association with sheep and                                  iroots.   Norfolk alone has nearly &quot;75th of the acreage in GreatBritain and somewhere about 60 per cent, is located in theEastern Counties, namely, East Anglia, Lincolnshire and the Eastand North Ridings of YorkshireP    About  /^th of the Great Britainacreage is-in Scotland.   Generally speaking, the acreage underbarley in Great Britain has steadily declined since the War, butthere has been some increase from the low point of 811,000 acres in 1933, the acreage varying usually according to the price inthe previous season.   Thus, there were noticeable increases inthe acreage in 1934 and In the present year, following goodprices for malting barley from the 1933 and 1937 crops.     2.   Acreage, production and yields of barley in GreatBritain in recent years have been as follows:-Year	Acres	/ Yield per Acre	Total Production1928-32 Average:	(thousands of acres. ) 1,158	(cwts. per acre) 16.3	(thousand tons) 9471933	811	17.0	6881934	957	17.1	8171935	868	&apos; 16.9	7321936	891	16.4	7291937	904	14. 5	6551933-37 Average:	886	16.4	7241938	985	17.2	846          It will be seen from these figures that larger acreageand higher yield have resulted this year in a total production which is some 200,000 tons greater than last year and higher thanin any of the previous five years.                                                    3.  imports.
     3.   Imports.    It  is difficult to  estimate  with  any  greataccuracy the effect  of imports  of barley upon  the home productin view of two  distinct  purposes for which barley is used, namely,             ***                                   &apos;for malting and feeding  and  the difficulty of  determining  what proportion of imports is of  malting quality.    It is known.,however, that the bulk of the barley imported  from certain countries is of the  type used for malting or feeding respectivelyand a further indication can. be gained from the average declaredvalues.   The following  table gives particulars of  the quantitiesimported in recent years divided according to  countries-&apos;1 whichsend barley mainly used  for  brewing, and &quot;other&quot;  countries.                                00C. cwt.                                                           1938                   1955   1934    1935     1956     1937    (Jan,v-                                  .- :: &apos;                      Get, only)From, brewing- barley           1,224   5,338   4,064    5,688    3,482-t  4,477-f countries from &quot;other&quot; countries       11,761  10 ,158__15,053   12,606_3.4,710   12,159    Total        15,935  15,476  17,097   18,294   18,192   16,616          +  These figures are partial only because information                in respect of certain countries  is not  available,,The quantities  imported  during the current year are undoubtedlyat a higher level than in recent years, but the increase is atleast as much in barleys of  feeding type, and  it  would appear thatfollowing the short  crop of  1937, rather more barley of maltingtype was imported in the early part of the year.   Galifornianbarley is understood to  constitute about 70 per cent,  of importsused for brewing and in  the  four months July to October, 1935,the quantity of U.8. barley  (mainly Californian)  was less  than inthe corresponding period of  1937.    Russia has been responsible i,for an appreciable part  of the increased imports  this year,especially in recent months,  and barley from this source is all of feeding quality.                                                       4e  F^ic^es-;   *  Irish Free  State, India, Australia,  Poland, Germany,      Czechoslovakia, Tunis,  Syria,  Turkey,  U.S.A. and Chile.
      4.    Prices.    T..&apos;- following table gives  the average prices per cwt.  of barley and oats in England  and Wales  for the first  three  months  of the season (September  to November) in recent  years  -           1933           s.  d. Barley .    10.1. Oats       5.4.            +  Note.     Prices  1st September to  19th November. The present price  of barley  is  as low as  7s. 5d.  and compares with 12.lOd. per cwt. at the  corresponding date  last year. For oats the latest price is  5s.lid.  compared  with 8s.5d. last year.           Prices in 1937 were high,  partly because of  the small  crop and partly because of  the  generally higher  level of  world cereal  prices  in that  year.    The marked fall below the  five years&apos;  average  this  season from  last  year&apos;s high level  has  accentuated farmers&apos;  sense  of grievance.           The following table shows  the index  numbers  of barley and of oats  compared with  the  general index of agricultural produce.    It illustrates  the steepness of the fall in prices of barley during the present year:-                                                   Annual1954   1955   1936s. d.  s. d.  s. d.9. 7.  9. 4.  10.1.6. 7.  6 o 1.   6.9.19,37   Average    1938+      of 5 yrs.s. d.    s. cl,    s. d.12.7.    10.4.    9. 1. 8.6.     6.8.    6. 4.

                       TEE BARLEY QUESTION                Part  II - aspects of jthe Prgjolem      5.    The  problem of home-grown, malting barley  is  essentially one  of a  fluctuating supply and a  restricted  demand.   Even  if  it were possible  to  impose a virtually prohibitive  duty on  imports of malting barley, this problem would remain.    The position  is complicated by the fact that there are two distinct markets  for barley, namely, for  &quot;malting and feeding purposes respectively, and  there  is an appreciable gap in normal circumstances between the  price  payable for an average sample of malting barley  and that payable for barley suitable only for feeding  to  livestock. Moreover,  whereas there are probably not more than  50-60 thousand growers of barley in the country,  there are&apos; at least 200,000 farmers who keep pigs and other livestock and need cheap barley for  feeding purposes.   Seeing that the demand for barley  for malting purposes is  comparatively  limited, it follows  that when yields  of  barley of  malting quality are good, as &quot;is the case this year,  the  quantity suitable for malting may be more than the brewers are able to  take.    This excess production of barley of malting quality over brewers1 normal requirements naturally brings down prices of all malting  harley, while some grades which are admittedly of malting quality have to find a market in the lower priced feedingstuffs  trade.     6.   For many years past attempts have been made  to find a means  of maintaining the price of malting barley without raising the price  of all barley.    An import duty on malting barley alone has hitherto been found to  be impracticahle, and the Import duties advisory Committee,  in  1935, after considering applications from  he Scottish National Farmers&apos;  Union for an increased  duty on all harley, and from the English 1T.F.U. for an increased duty onmalting barley only,  decided to allow the applications to remain in suspense, pending the operation of a Gentlemen&apos;s Agreement                                                      which
 which they negotiated with  the Brewers&apos; cU :,J.ety, under which the brewers  as a  whole  have undertaken  to iv.&apos;:  not less than 7  million cwts.  of home  grown &quot;barley, with a proportionate rise as the barrelage  of beer  increases  over the 1935 level.   A somewhat similar  arrangement was ma.de with distillers.   In the year  ended June,  1938, the brewers  actually used just over 8  million cwts.   In a year of good crop?  like the present, when much  of  the barley  is of malting quality,  these arrangements still leave a  considerable quantity of barley of malting quality not consumed by brewers and distillers  for malting purposes.      7.    Apart from -or rather, in addition to - the special difficulties  of ensuring a remunerative market for malting barley, there  is  the  general problem e*f the barley grower who (with the grower of - oats) maintains that the assistance at present afforded is  inadequate.      8.   All foreign barley pays the general 10 per cent. ad valorem  duty, but  in view of the firm demand of brewers  for certain types of foreign malting barley and the amount of duty - free Empire barley  this duty probably has   little protective effect.     9.   Under Part  II of the Agriculture Act, 1937, a limited measure of  assistance of a price in curt nee character is given to growers of  eats and barley who do not grow &quot;wheat or who do  not- elect to  take wheat  deficiency payments.    The subsidy is paid at so much per acre, representing six times  the difference between the standard price for oats of 8s.Od.  per  cwt. and the UnitedKingdom average price covering the seven monbhs September to march.   To limit the Treasury liability  the maximum payment per acre is fixed at  1 and there is a standard acreage representing / 0ths of  the actual qualifying acreage  in 1937,    Barley  grower-3received about 2/6d. per acre under this measure in respect of the1937 crop, and are expected to receive about 10/- per acre  inrespect of the 1938 crop.                                                       - 10.   The
    10.   The case which has &quot;been put before the Minister onbehalf of the barley grower is that his position, in so far ashe is dependent on the returns from his barley crop, is desperateand that unless something is done &apos;there will be a serious fallin the barley acreage, some land going out of cultivationaltogether.   Twe questions therefore fall fox-- consideration -     (l) the case for immediate assistance, which could            only be afforded by some additional payment to            the industry from the Exchequer;     (2) what action, if any, can be taken with or without            statutory backing and with er without additional            Exchequer assistance, to prevent the recurrence            of a ci^isis such as has occurred this year.          The first question  is  examined in Part.  Ill   &quot;of this memorandum.    The second is a long term problem   which will need a little longer time for examination.
                  THE BARLEY QUESTION     Part III - The case for immediate assistance   11,   There seems to be no room for doubt that the slump inbarley prices is causing serious distress, especially in some districts,    A case for special Exchequer assistance to allbarley growers based only on those grounds would however not onlybe difficult to justify, but would be open to grave objections ofprinciple,   12.   It would, in particular, involve removing the restrictionimposed for very good reasons in the Agriculture Act, under whicha grower can elect to receive oats and barley subsidies, or wheat deficiency payments, but not both.     The position of the producer whose main cereal crop is wheat and who will receive onthe. average 45/- per quarter on the heavy yields of this year can hardly be desperate.   13.   To comply with the request for a sort of ex gratiapayment to all barley growers on account of low prices formalting barley would lead to very serious difficulties.     the exceptionally low prices for malting barley this season aredemonstrably due, to a considerable extent., to an exceptionally heavy home crop.    Both the acreage and the yield of the barleycrop in 1938 were higher than in any of the previous five years&quot;indeed, the yield per acre was only exceeded twice in the previous17 years, and the total production was greater than in any of theprevious eight years with the exception of 1931 a high proportionof this barley is of malting quality.     On the other hand, the yield per acre in 1937 fell to an abnormally low levelj   it has only been lower during two of the last twenty years.i,   14.   The average yield per acre of any particular crop of barley for the country as a whole is determined entirely by thenature of the season.  Seasonal fluctuation of yield is a normal^feature of crop production, and the Government cannot be expectedto come to the assistance of producers who are in difficulties                                                       that
                                                                %3 ij  .? that  are  due  to  this  cause;   it  is  an  essential feature of crop production  that  one season has to he taken with another,   One has  only  to think of  fruit and potatoes  to realise what a dangerous precedent would he  created if  the Government were to take  action on this account alone,    15.   The  acreage  under the crop is?  of course., under the control of  growers themselves.   Past  experience shows that the acreage in  any year is  influenced by the price of barley in the previous  year;   when  growers  think  that prices will be good they increase  their acreages, and  vice versa.   Herein lies the danger of any action which will lead growers  to assume that the Government  will be ready to step in with State money to counteract the effects of over-production;  over-production will be encouraged;   the  difficulties of the situation will be accentuated; and the need  for  some form of assistance to growers will be increased.    This slippery slope was foreseen and guarded against in the Oats and Barley Scheme under the Agriculture Act, 1937, by the establishment of the principle  of  a standard acreage which would limit the liability of  the Exchequer and discourage any- increase  in acreage,   Any increased Exchequer assistance in respect of  this  season other  than that provided for under the agriculture Act would involve the abandonment of this principle, and would certainly create increased difficulties for the Government  in the future.   Unfortunately, the only real remedy in these circumstances is painful to growers;  on the other hand;, there is no justification for encouraging over-production of any commodity.    16.   If  the barley crop were to be considered in isolation this argument would appear to be decisive, but the difficulties of the situation have been considerably accentuated by the recentfall in the price of sheep.    The sheep and barley lands have, forsome years,  constituted the black spots of British agriculture,even when sheep and barley prices have not been abnormally low.                                                       The
The difficulties here have &quot;been due mainly to the high labour costs of  this particular form of farming.   Reserves of capital in these  areas have steadily been depleted and there is noreason  to  doubt that this double blow of low prices for sheep and -low prices  for barley this year has made the position desperate.    17.    The only assistance contemplated for the sheep industryis a stricter control of imports, a measure which (even if it canbe brought  into force in the near future) is likely to be more of psychological than of practical value for seme time to come.    18.    If, therefore, it is decided that on political grounds and in  order te reduce the danger of a number of these farmersgoing bankrupt and their land becoming derelict, some cashassistance  should be given to them forthwith, the only practicablebasis for a payment is the barley crop.    19.    It must be recognised, however, that the justification for special assistance can only be exceptionally low prices formal tingbarley, or  exceptional distress due to a combination of circumstances.   The objections to the first basis are set out above;  the dangers of the second, as affording a precedent, notonly for agriculture but for other industries, are obyious.The N.P.U.  have in fact also applied for &quot;distressed area&quot; grants for certain fruit-growers whose crops were ruined by exceptionallysevere hail-storms.   These objections could be met to someextent  if the assistance were given in the form of an advanceagainst some fund to be created in connection with a long-termscheme;  e.g. the proceeds of an increased duty on imports of barley.    20.   It must also be recognised that any suggestion that aspecial payment should be made to barley growers will intensifythe demand  from Scottish oat growers that they should be givenassistance  on a basis more comparable with that given to wheatgrowers, which will amount this year to over  4 per acre.    It may prove impossible politically to resist this pressure.   It is truethat the Conservative Agricultural Committee consider that a case
&quot;for different treatment  could be  made  out  on  the  grounds  that oats are  not  a cash crop (this, however,- would he contested by Scotsmen);   it^ is  true also  that  oats  prices  have not fallen, to the same  extent as barley prices;   and that since one-ninth of the barley  acreage is in Scotland,  that  country would get her . &quot;Goschen  proportion&quot; of  any  barley  payments.   But the possibility is  one  to be  seriously taken into account.     21.   If,  notwithstanding  the considerations set out above, it  is felt that  some further Government  assistance should be given to  barley growers,  or some barley growers, in respect of this year&apos;s crop there  are two alternative methods that are worthy of consideration, namely:-                (a) A special flat rate acreage subsidy to all          growers  of barley  in the United Kingdom, either in          addition  to or  in  substitution for the assistance          under  the Agriculture Act, 1957;  or                (b) An increase in the rate of assistance under          the Agriculture Act.     22.   A flat rate subsidy would have the merit of a dm in i-a trativ simplicity.     It would, however, obviously he very much more costly unless  the rate of assistance were low, which would defeat its  special purpose, than a  scheme that did something to confine the  assistance to those harley growers who need it most.   Therewere 988,000 acres under barley in the United Kingdom for the harvest of 1938;  a flat rate subsidy of  1 an aero Would, thereforcost about  1,000,000.    But although malting harley prices forthis year&apos;s crop have now fallen to a low level, a number ofgrowers, of the best quality, malting barley,  particularly inNorfolk, were able to sell their crop in the  early part  of the season at reasonably remunerative prices.  Moreover, many of theseproducers also grow wheat and sugar beet and  produce fat cattle;they are not in the desperate plight that would warrant  exceptionalassistance,  as are the  farmers on the light sheep  and barleylands;  assistance to them would be difficult  to justify.    Thesame objection would apply to the alternative  proposal made by the                                               Conservative
 Conservative Parliamentary Agricultural Committee.  .Their proposal is that the provisions of the Agriculture Act should he suspended for the current season so far as barley is concerned, that all barley growers should receive a flat rate subsidy of  1 per acre, and that a bonus of 5s,  per acre should be paid to those barley growers whose applications for subsidy have been accepted this year.    The 5s.  bonus would cost  50,000 in addition to the  938,000 for the flat rate subsidy.     23.   An amendment of the  rate of assistance under the Agriculture Act would be open  to fewer objections.    In view of the special nature of the subsidy it  seems desirable that any amendment of the Act should be as simple  as  possible,  and that it should not create any embarrassing precedent.    It  would,  for example,  appear to be undesirable to  amend the standard price in the Act,    The  simplest  amendment would be to  permit Barley Subsidy  to be paid on the  existing basis, but  on  a larger proportion  of  the crop.   At the  present  time  subsidy  is  paid at the  acreage  rate  of  six  times  the  difference between the  standard price  of  8s. per  cwt.  and  the  average market price (of  oats); In other  words,  subsidy  is  assumed to be paid  on  6 cwt.  of barley per  acre, whereas the  ten years&apos; average yield is 16.5  cwt.,  and the  average  yield this year  is 17;. 2 cwt. per acre.     24.   It seems probable that during the present  selling season the average United Kingdom price of oats under the agriculture Act will be 5s.l0d. per cwt.   The difference between this market price and the standard price of 8s. would be 2s.2d. per  cwt., which would involve a subsidy payment of six times this amount, namely, 13s.  per acre for barley if the standard acreagehad not been exceeded.   Owing, however, to. the fact that this year the qualifying acreage exceeds the standard acreage, therate of assistance will be reduced from about 13s. per acre to about 10s. per acre.    The present acreage rate for barley hasno logical basis;  it is merely the same &quot;rate as the acreage                                                         rate
 rate  for  oats,  subject  to  any adjustment that may have to be made  if  the  standard  acreage is exceeded.   The acreage rate of subsidy for  oats  is based  on the proportion of the total oat crop that  is  sold on farms,  which is less than 40 per cent.   But the total quantity  of barley sold off farms is about 80 per cent.; on this basis the rate  of  subsidy would be 28s. per acre if no reduction were  made on  account of the fact that the qualifying acreage exceeds the standard acreage;  if the rate is to be increased it  would, of  course, be inconsistent to make any such reduction.    The  chief  objection to such an increase in the rate of barley subsidy is  that  it might create a demand that in future the rate of Barley  Subsidy should be based each year on the 80 per cent,  of the crop that is sold off farms instead of less  than 40  per  cent,  as  at present.   In order to avoid this difficulty it seems  deferable not to associate a special subsidy with  the  amount sold  off farms, and instead to give a round sum of  1 per acre  in  respect  of  the acreage of barley that has qualified for subsidy  this  year.   A rate of subsidy of  1 per acre is double the estimated  rate  that barley growers would receive under the Agriculture Act in the erdinary way.   The doubling of the rate  would be justified as a special measure of assistance fer this  season only, owing to the exceptional circumstances.    25.   The qualifying acreage for barley this year is 200,000 acres.   A subsidy of  1 an acre would, therefore,, cost  200,000 in all, or  100,000&apos;more than would be payable under the existing provisions of the Agriculture Act.    26.   It  is practically certain, however, that if this increased rate  of assistance were announced, there would at once be a,demand that all barley growers who&apos;have elected to receive the wheat subsidy instead  of oats and barley subsidy should be given an opportunity  to reconsider their decision.    There will, of course, be a number of barley growers with a comparatively small acreage of wheat who have elected to receive wheat subsidy                                                      because                           15.
because the acreage rate of that subsidy is so much greaterthan that for oats and barley;  the acreage rate for wheatthis season will be over  4 per acre, which is eight times theestimated rate for barley under the existing scheme.   If the acreage rate of subsidy for barley is doubled it would pay someof these growers to transfer their election to barley.   Itwould probably be very difficult to resist this demand;  ifit is acceded to the total cost of the barley subsidy wouldbe increased.to that extent.   What the increase in the qualifying acreage would be it is impossible to say;  the totalcost of the subsidy would, of course, be increased by  1 forevery additional acre brought Into the barley subsidy scheme onthis account.   At the present time the qualifying acreage of barley is about one-fifth of the total barley acreage.   It is unlikely that the granting of this concession would more thandouble this acreage;  it is probable that the Increase would bemuch less.   If the qualifying acreage were doubled, the extra cost of the  1 per acre scheme would be  300,000, and the totalcost would be  400,000.          To sum up:-     (l) Additional financial assistance to barley growers, or           some barley growers, would have to be justified on           the grounds -           (a) that barley prices are exceptionally low, or           (b) that barley growers, or some barley growers,                 are in a state of special financial distress,                 owing to a combins.tion of circumstances.     (2) Whichever justification is put forward a dangerous           precedent would be created;  but the second is open           to fewer objections than the first.     (3) If any special financial assistance is given to barley           growers, a strong demand from oat growers for           similar assistance, which it may be very difficult t           resist, must be anticipated.                                14.
(4) If, notwithstanding these difficulties,  it ,is  considered      that some special assistance  should he given to  barley-      growers, the method open to the fewest objections  would      be to make an ad hoc increase in the rate  of assistance      under the Agriculture Act. (5)  A payment of  1 an acre,  l.e.  double the rate which      would be payable under the existing provisions of  the      Agriculture Act, would cost an additional   100,000      on existing qualifying acreage.    To this  would      probably have to be added a further sum, not likely      &quot;to exceed  200,000, in respect of payments to  growers      who would wish under the  new  conditions to &quot;opt&quot; for      barley and oats subsidy instead of wheat subsidy.      The total cost would be  about  400,000, including      present commitments of about   100,000.
