(THIS DOCUMENT IS  THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)..SECRET.CP.  270 (58).CAB I NET.WESTMINSTER HOUSE SITE.Memorandum &quot;by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.,1.   On the Order Paper of the House of Commons appears a motion in the following terms, in the names of Sir SidneyHerbert and SOI other Members:-          That this House is of opinion that it          would be a national calamity if a          commercial &quot;building were to &quot;be erected          on the Westminster House site and the          opportunity lost of adding this area to          the open space of Parliament Square;          and urges His Majesty&apos;s Government to          play their part, in conjunction with the          London County Council *  the Middlesex          County Council, and the Westminster City          Council, in preserving for all time.a          dignified approach, in the heart of the          Empire, to the Abbey of Westminster, the          Houses of Parliament, and Whitehall,2.   The site concerned adjoins the Canning Enclosure,,   upon it are the buildings formerly known as Nos* 14, 15 and 16Great George Street.   A small part of the site has already&quot;been cleared &quot;but most of the original buildings remain.   the site was purchased &quot;by the Middlesex County Council in 1935 forthe sum of  374,000 - a price which I am advised is far inexcess of the real value owing to the intervention of aspeculator.   The purchase was originally made ostensibly inconnection with the need for extending the Council&apos;s offices,the main block of which lies behind the site.   Ever since theirpurchase the Council have been endeavouring to relieve them-selves of the burden of this expenditure.COPY NO.  ^
3,   The Council proposed, in particular, that the siteshould he made an  open space in perpetuity at the jointexpense of  the London, Middlesex and Westminster CountyCouncils- and the Exchequer.   In 1935 the Prime Minister,when Chancellor of the Exchequer, refused any contributionon  the ground that the Treasury would not feel justified,in  view of  the heavy financial commitments present and prospective, in allocating public funds to a scheme ofthis nature.,  . The matter was subsequently referred to theCabinet (CP. 178 (35)) who agreed that the proposedimprovement of the amenities of Parliament Square was not one of sufficient importance from a national point of -view to justify a departure from the ordinary practicethat the cost of improvement to Cities should be paid forby Local Authorities;  consequently the devotion of thetaxpayers&apos; money to this purpose could not be approved(Cabinet 44 (35) Conclusion 5) 04.   Since then the matter has been raised on a number of occasions, notably by the All Parties Amenities Group ofthe Houses of Parliament.   On the last occasion (May ofthis year), after a deputation from the Amenities group had come to see me, the application of the Middlesex council was again considered.   It appeared that the London CountyCouncil and the Westminster County Council would,.in all probability, be willing to contribute  100,000 and  50,000respectively to the cost while the Middlesex County council were prepared only to make an offer of  50,000 despite their responsibility in acquiring the site and the greatlyincreased value which would attach to their existingoffices by reason of the clearance of the site.    The totalcost&apos;(including io?d-making expenses) being  390,000, thiswould have meant a contribution of  190,000 from the
Government, including some  40,000 from the Road Fund.5.   I came to the conclusion that the amount of the offers made left far too great a gap for the exchequer to fill;  and the Amenities Group were informed thatthis decision was inevitable owing to the exceedingly-heavy demands on the Exchequer.6.   The immediate reason for the present Motion is astatement by the Middlesex County Council that they havereceived an offer to erect an office building on the site which would recoup the Council for the expenditure which they have incurred.    It is, of course, regrettable.that such a site, when cleared,  should be built upon.It should be emphasized, however, that this is not a case where a building is to be erected on what has hitherto been an open space,   It is a case of substituting onebuilding for another and it is easy to exaggerate theresults of the change,   We should, I feel, be prematurein assuming that the building would necessarily be ofan unsuitable character in view of the powers of theLondon County Council who would also, no doubt, in acase of this nature, call the ^ioyal Fine Art Commissioninto consultation.V.   So far as finance is concerned, although&apos; I bring .the matter before my colleagues in order that they maybe aware of the position generally, I must record my view that, having regard to the events of the last months and their effect on national expenditure, it seemshardly possible to agree now to a contribution whichwas refused six months ago owing to the exigencies ofour financial position, and I feel that there is now no
option &quot;but to make an announcement of a final characterremoving any hope of financial assistance from theExchequer over and above any grant which would be payable in^the ordinary way from the Road Fund in theevent of the scheme going through.
