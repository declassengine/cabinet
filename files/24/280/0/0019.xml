THE COMMITTEE had &quot;before them a Memorandum on NationalNational Service Service Registration by the Lord Privy Seal  (paper No*Registration.                 F.p. (36) 67) to which were attached (i)  a proof  of                 the National Service Handbook and (ii) a  copy of  the                 Final Report of the Sub-Committee on the  Control of               &quot;  Man Power of the Man Power Sub--Commit tee  of  the Committee                 of Imperial Defence (Paper NoD N. S  (CM.) 29) 0                      THE PRIME MINISTER reminded the Committee that                 at their previous meeting when the question  of national                 service registration was considered he had suggested                 that it might be helpful to the Committee to hear the                 views which the Lord Privy Seal had formulated on the                 sub jectaA Scheme for          THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that at  the outset lie hadvoluntarynational         reached the conclusion that a settlement  of  theserviceregistration.    Government&apos;s policy in regard to national service was                 a matter of great urgency.  As he had  at  that time no                 staff he had conferred with Sir Ernest Growerss the                 Chairman of the Sub-Committee on the Control of Man Power                 and his Memorandum (paper No.  F.P. (36) 67)  was prepared                 after consultation with Sir Ernest and with officials                 of the Ministry of Labour.                      Perhaps the most pressing aspect of the matter                 was the need for providing help and guidance to the very                 large number of persons who wished to serve  their country                 in an emergency but were in doubt as to -what they ought                 to do or how to set about  doing it.   There was no                 proper  machinery for co-ordinating this vast flood of
                                                m   233 .offers  of voluntary service     It was  true  that  theMinistry of Labour had &quot;for BOWS time been preparing ahandbook, a copy of which it wos proposed to supply to every household and from which it was hoped thateveryone would be able to ascertain the ways in whichhe or she could register for national service,,   Thishandbook needed to be supplemented by the &quot;schedule of Reserved Occupations&quot; which had been prepared withthe greatest care by the Ministry of Labour, in consul-tat ion with the Departments concerned,,    This schedule,which was now complete, covered some 8-9 million persons and was designed to be used on the outbreak of war toprevent the enlistment of men engaged in the occupationscomprised in it*   It would&apos; however also have very valuable uses in connection with volt^tary nationalservice registration^   Up to the present the schedulehad been treated as a secret document and all knowledgeof it had been withheld from employers  and labour *The Ministry of Labour had represented that before theschedule could be published it would&apos;be necessary toexplain to organised enrployers &apos;and labour the purposes for which It had been preparedj  indeed the Ministry had gone further and had urged that the, lines on which.the.organisation of national service would be undertaken shouldbe definitely settled before the necessary consultationswere entered upona       The handbook which had been hastily printed mustnot be regarded as in its final forra0    Some changes of form and substance would In any event be required and the text before the Committee must be looked upon as a first proof0   It should be noted that the handbookwould not by itself answer all questions and solve all
 difficulties.    It must be read in conjunction with the Schedule of Reserved Occupations and the two documents would have to  he in the hands  of all recruiting offices, employment exchanges and similar organisations. Moreover,  some local organisation should he  available to give guidance to persons in doubt as  to what they should do  and  this should be made clear  in the handbook,, The organisation should be on  the lines  of the employment exchange system,,  The, local offices might be  termed national service  offices,,  They should be separate from the labour exchanges,  as  from  the point  of view of national service,  a  Ministry of Labour label would not be attractive,!    The  expenditure  on the  provision of the facilities  need not  be  substantial^       THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER asked who would be  responsible for  creating the  new  organisation.       THE  LORD PRIVY SEAL  said  that  as  the Ministry of Labour would be the  parent  of  the Ministry of  National Service  it would presumably be for the Ministry of Labour to  create the new organisation0       THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER said that this might be a matter for discussion.   It might perhaps be preferable if the Lord Privy Seal took over responsibilityfor the new organisation^       THE LORD PRIVY SEAL (continuing) said that when the scheme as a whole was launched it would be desirable to set up quite simple machinery for co-ordinating the recruiting for the various services etce
               It was  not contemplated that  there  would &quot;be any               displacement   of the existing recruiting machinery and               services but  merely that they should be properly and             &apos; .effectively co-ordinatede                      His proposals had throughout been prepared on a               voluntary basis*   The registers to be kept by the               various recruiting services would provide the man-power               for the first, second and third lines for a considerable               period  after  the outbreak of  war,    If we started on               the  voluntary basis and then,  when war broke out,               changed,  as no doubt we should have to do,  to a               compulsory system it was of great importance that the             - /transfer from the one system  to the other should be               smooth  and as frictionless as possible.,    He himself               believed that the offers of voluntary service Virould be               greatly in excess of requirements and he  accordingly &apos;               proposed to keep a  central reserve  or pool  in each               Division9   Drafts  from this  would  be made  to meet  the               needs of  the  various services and would be  dependent.               on factors such as  the  age and  qualifications of  the               individuals,proposal to            So far he had dealt with his  proposals for  the,xpedi te941 Census     immediate organisation  of  national  voluntary  service.achinery*               His next  suggestion was  that  arrangements  should be               made now  to expedite the compilation of a  complete               national  register if and when a  decision to  that  effect               was take no    He did not  believe  that such  a  register               would fulfil  any immediate requirement but  it  would               -undoubtedly be  most  useful and valuable on  the outbreak
 of war in connection with matters such as food rationing, the  tracing of shirkers etc.  It would also afford invaluable statistical informa- tion from which could be ascertained with precision the available man-power of the country.  We were at the moment in the worst possible position for ascertaining this, as the last census had been taken as long ago as 1931.  What was proposed was to anticipate now the steps which would in any case have to be taken in 1939 to build up the organisation which will eventually be used in the 1941 census.  The Registrar-General could start now to engage and train his enumerators, to revise finally the enumeration districts and to print the forms and schedules*    This would involve no additional expense  apart  rom the cost of t-Jio preparation and printing of the national registration forms - whichwould be different from the census formsj- thiowould amount to some  6,000 - , 7,000.  He (the Lord Privy  Seal) suggested that any difficulties that might arise could satisfactorilybe overcome.   It would be very prudent for theGovernment to take this step to expedite the compilation of a complete national register.
       The remaining proposition was  a more tentati^^ 7one,,   It seemed certain that the viridespread. eagerness  toserve  so mBoii. in evidence  since the crisis would not toofully  satisfied unless  the Government could providegeneralised  training for the unallocated  reserve on a muchmore ambitious scale than  was contemplated at present..Unless something of this kind was done there was danger that public  opinion might  get out of  hand.       In reply to enquiries THS LORD PRIVY S 11:11 observed. that this generalised training would  include physical training and attention  to  physical fitness, as well as other  forms  of training.   The Services, which would requirewomen  were set out in the  handbook and included Air RaidPrecautions, Medical and Nursing and  Red  Cross, Land Armyetc.       The handbook was criticised as heavy and unattractiveand it was suggested that  it would make a much  greaterappeal to the public if it was revised in a more popularform on the  lines of the leaflets issued  by.the Ministryof Health on Contributory  Pensions.       The Lord Privy Seal observed that  the handbook,revisedas he  contemplated, might-  be regarded as a book ofreference fov use by local and other  public authorities,recruiting offices, employers and others, and that it mightbe  supplemented by leaflets in much  simpler and more attractive form for distribution to individual  households.Incidentally this would mean a&apos; substantial saving ofexpense.       THE CI-IANCELLCR OP THE EXCHEQUER pointed  out thatin any case  the handbook was not self-contained, since it did not contain the Schedule of Reserved  Occupations.As it  stood  it was neither one thing nor  the other.       THE HOME SECRETARY said that Air Raid Precautions ,had been started with elaborate booklets, but experience
had shown that what was best suited to the ordinarycitizen was something on the lines of an election leaflet.       THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL thought the hand-booh to6* heavy and indigestible for the ordinary citizen,large numbers of whom would in any case do what their leaders advised while others would require coaxing.       THE LORD PRIVY SEAL suggested that he should have discretion to decide the form in which the Government&apos;policy would be communicated.   There was very little time available as enthusiasm was rapidly cooling - the pot wasgetting off the boil - and was being replaced by a sense of irritation at the apparent inaction of the Government.           -It was very important that some move should be made in thenear future but that in the meantime nothing should beallowed to leak out as to the Government&apos;s intentions.There should be a clear statement of the Government&apos;policy and a cheerful message of hope and confidence for -Christmas and the New Year.       THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF DEFENCE doubted whether this should be stressed.  He had recently discussed the question with some Left Wingers who were very unhappyat the Government&apos;s apparent failure to give a definitelead.   They had indicated their willingness to pledge them-selves through their association to accept compulsory national service.   He hoped a very early announcement of theGovernment&apos;s policy would be made so as to enable the whole matter, including the distribution of. leaflets etc. , to befloated before Christmas.   It might then be possible forthe King to refer to the subject if he decided to givea Christmas broadcast.
                                                M *J eS       THE CHAI C/JLLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER asked whetherthe proposals, including the suggested accelerationor&quot; the census arrangements, would involve  legislation..An.-essential feature of any kind of national serviceregistration WPS that it should be  rept up to date.From this point of view the Census had little or no value.       THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that he would verifyhis impression that his proposals would not involve legislation.  If no steps were taken now to expedite the preparation of a National Register in case- of need and if an emergency occurred it would he months.after the outbreak of war &quot;before a National Registercould be compiled.  Matters such as the settlement ofthe forms and their printing, the enrolment andinstruction of enumerators all took much time.  Itwas only proposed to collect the  machinery andtune it up so as to ensure that a National Register -would be in existence a few weeks after war broke out.  He strongly advised an early announcement on the subject.  This would serve to reassure those people who were demanding immediate compulsory national registration.  Under his plan we shall havea National Register of volunteers,.       THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that theLord Privy Seal had stated that compulsory registrationwould almost certainly be necessary when war broke out.  Would not it be argued that it would be better to set up such registration now?                    -8-
7 ill       THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that the answer was;hat it would not he Letter and for the following,among other, reasons - ta institute compulsion now would detract from, hinder and prohahly stopvoluntary effort;  a compulsory National Registercould not he completed for many months and would very soon ho aut**of-date;  the ideal would he a registerprepared after the initial disturbances (removal of population etc.) incidental to the outhreak of war.For all practical purposes his plan was a much betterone.  It would give all the statistical information required and the arrangements must of course be keptconstantly up-to-date.  His scheme would give the required man power for months after war broke out.It would also enable the enumerators in an emergencyto deliver identity cards which would constitute thebasis for recruiting, food rationing, etc.       THE SECRETARY OF STATE FtR FOREIGN affairs asked what was the difference between the plan of theLord Privy Seal and that of a compulsory registerkept up-to-date.       THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that as a matter ofmere administrative mechanics it would be impossibleto keep any compulsory National Register up-to-date.Such a register very soon got hopelessly stale fromleakage, dead names, removals, etc.  Revision wouldbe useless and the only cure would be to prepare anentirely fresh register.     THE HOME SECRETARY asked whether the samecriticism ^ould not be applied to a voluntary register.
        THE LORD PRIVY  SEAL pointed out  that  in a voluntary register  the first  category would  Toe persons^bound for service to some authority, e.go  special constables:  by the  nature of their service,  the information  as to such persons would be kept alive and up-to-date,  The same thing  applied to the second category namely the  reserves  for services covered by the first category,,  It would be for the respective recruiting organisations to see  that the registers were  alive and up-to-date as  regards their reserves. It would only be in  the case  of  the unallocated general reserves that  the voluntary registers would get out of date.       &apos; In reply to the  Prime  Minister, THE LORD PRIVY SEAL  explained that  the Schedule of Reserved  Occupations dealt with individuals  by reference to  their occupation.:  Clerical workers  were  not included;, in it-. A large proportion of  the clerical  workers occupying key positions in industry would&quot;&apos;be  outside military age.   It would be for  arrangement with  the recruiting services that persons  in the  Schedule&apos;5who were also Territorials or Reservists would not /be - taken away for military service until they  could be spared,,
                                                -   242&quot; .     THE HOME SECRETARY emphasised two considerations.   Inthe first place  a very early.announcement should he made ofthe GovernmentVs intention to establish a national registeron a voluntary basis.   In the second place all the necessary preparations should oe made in advance for an organisedrecruiting campaign to start immediately after the announce-ment of policy was made..      THE LORD PRIVY SEAL warned the Committee that theeffect of intensive propaganda on the subject might be thatthe Government would find themselves embarrassed by a verylarge number of applications in excess, of possible require-ments.  Moreover, if large numbers of recruits were obtained before proper facilities for training,  etco  were provided,trouble was bound to ensue.   Subject to these qualificationshe was in agreement with the Home Secretary,      THE LORD PRESIDENT OP THE COUNCIL thought that from thepoint of view of the effect to be produced abroad it was essential that it should be made clear that  having adopted thepolicy the Government would go through with  it to the bitterend.          &quot;      THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that his idea had been that a detailed statement of the Government^  proposals should bemade in Parliament within the next fortnight,  but that theMinister of Labour had felt that it was desirable that theviews of organised labour should be ascertained in advanceof any announcement in Parliament.      THS MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF DEFENCE hoped that theannouncement would not be held up pending the ascertainmentof the views of organised labour.    In a matter of this kindlabour moved slowly as the Trade Union leaders would feel bound to consult their constituents.
          THE PRIME MINISTER thought that  the  Parliamentary statement should he a comprehensive one covering &quot;both  the voluntary and compulsory aspects  of the problem.          THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that he had in mind  that the statement should cover his  scheme for voluntary national service registration,  and in addition his proposal for expediting the preparation of a national  register in case of need.    He was more doubtful about Including  the training proposals.          THE LORD PRESIDENT  OP  THE COUNCIL asked whether it would not be possible  to publish  the announcement earlier than a fortnight hence.          THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS hoped that the announcement  would be made  some time  in the  following week          THE PRIME MINISTER  thought  that  the  question  must be brought before the Cabinet for  consideration  and decision. He suggested that the  Lord Privy  Seal should  prepare and circulate to the  Cabinet for consideration at  the Meeting on Wednesday,  November 30th. , the  draft of the statement  *jf policy  to be announced In Parliament.   The statement  to be comprehensive and businesslike  and  to show  that  the demand for compulsory  national  service  can,  in effect, be more satisfactorily made in the manner suggested by the Lord Privy Seal.          He  (the Prime Minister) felt some anxiety about the point which  had been stressed by the Minister of Labour, Perhaps,  however,  it would be found possible to consult organised employers and labour in regard to the Schedule of reserved  Occupations after the Parliamentary announcement hadbeen made.   If so, that announcement could be made  very  soon;In fact on Thursday, December 1st. ,  if the Cabinet  approved the statement of policy on November 30th,
     THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OP DEFENCE ref-rredg^p^the special  census of men employed, in a number of important industries,  namely. Engineering., Construction and Repair  of vehicles, Metal Manufacture,-. Other Metal  industries, Scient-ific and Photographic Instrument and Apparatus Manufacture,Shipbuilding and Ship repairing, which had been used in the revision of  the Schedule of Reserved Occupations (seeparagraph 21 of No 3c (CM.) 29),     THE HOME SECRETARY thought that this and other relevant information  should be made public  But public opinion was anxious to know that the Government had decided to open anentirely new chapter on this subjectc     It was  most important that the announcement should bemade that we were setting up a register in the most effectivemanner and that it had the two-fold merit of being a voluntary-and a compulsory register combinedo     THE PRIME MINISTER suggested that after the Cabinet  had approved the statement of policy but before r-he Parliamentaryannouncement was made, the Lord Privy Seal should meet thelobby correspondents and expound his proposals and thereasons for  them in detail.     The Committee agreed i     (l) That the proposals of the Lord Privy Seal for         national service registration-contained in Paper         P.P.(36) 67 should be reserved for the considera-         tion and decision of the Cabinet at the Meeting         to  be held on Wednesday;, November 30th j  l938o     (2) That the Lord Privy Seal should  prepare for con-         sideration at the Meeting of the Cabinet on         November 30tho, a statement of the policy of the         Government in regard to national registration,         on  the lines of his proposals in Paper Fop.(3G)67         with a view to that statement, in the form         approved by the Cabinet,, being made in Parliament         on  Thursday, December 1st a     (3) That the Lord Privy Seal should  arrange to meet         the lobby correspondents for the purpose, of         expounding his proposals., in the interval between         the Meeting of the&apos; Cab:;.;./-.: or. N&apos;  -&quot;ember 30th.,         and the announcement in Parliament on December Isto     (4) To  take note of the Prime Minister&quot;s suggestion         that it might be found possible  to meet the point         raised by the Minister of Labour by consulting         organised employers  and labour  on the Schedule         of  Reserved Occupations, after the Parliamentary         announcement, of the Government&apos; s i^olicyc,
