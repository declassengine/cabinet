THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY 0? HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S COvERNIffiNT.SECRET.107CP.256(58).COPY NO;CABINET.PROPOSED BILL TO AMEND THE WIEMPL0YM3NT INSURiO\TCE AdTS.Memorandum by the Minister of Labour.1.  A Bill to amend the Unemployment Insurance Acts has been promised in theKing&apos;s Speech.   I now submit for the approval of my colleagues an outline ofthe provisions which I propose to include in the Bill.2.  Holidays and Unemployment Insurance.     The Amulree Committee on Holidays with Pay drew attention to the desirabilityof examining the existing law of Unemployment Insurance in relation to thepayment of contributions and benefit during periods of &quot;holiday&quot; and as theresult I asked the Unemployment Insx.vra.nce Statutory Committee to consider thematter and to advise.   A copy of their report is attached.3.. The conclusions reached by the Statxxtory Committee follow from the principle which they recommend (i 23) - and which I think we should accept - that&quot;Holidays should be treated as an incident of employment.   UnemploymentInsurance should be confined to unemployment&quot;.   Holidays are not dealt with assuch in the existing legislation.   The many questions which arise in relation, tothe payment of benefit for &quot;holidays&quot; have been dealt with by the Umpire as ,questions whether on particular days the claimant is unemployed and availablefor work.   The position produced by the Umpire&apos;s decisions is in many waysunsatisfactory.   Thus, benefit is not payable for a holiday taken by expressagreement between employers and workpeople.   But there are -many examples ofsuch agreements in which the duration of the true holiday period is intentionallyunderstated in order that the workpeople may draw benefit for that portion ofthe holiday v/hich is not covered by the agreement.   Again, a claimant isregarded as unemployed and entitled to benefit during a  holiday period whichhas npt by recurrence during at least five and often a longer number of years been established as a period of recognised or customary Holiday.   Another, andmost troublesome, anomaly is that days  of unpaid but recognised holiday may,although benefit is not payable for such days, be  counted as days of unemploymentfor the purpose of the &quot;waiting time&quot; at the beginning of a period of continous unemployment or as days  of unemplo3prjant to maintain continuity of                                 1.
unemployment.    The inconvenience and anomalies resulting from this interpretation of the law are described in 8S 15 and 16 of the Report  of theStatutory Committee.    The Committee say in relation to the general position (8 2l);and I concur,  &quot;The extent to which under the present law holiday leisure can be converted into unemployment for the purpose of insurance is already producingmany anomalies and is bringing the insurance scheme into disrepute. &quot;4.  In order to deal with this situation I propose a clause in the Bill to theeffect of that suggested by the Statutory Committee (S 33) &quot;Except as  may beprovided by regulations made under this section an insured person shall not bedeemed to be unemployed on any of his days of holiday, and any such da3r ofholiday shall be .treated as non-existent for the purpose of reckoning  continuity of unemployment&quot;.5.  I propose as recommended by the Statutory Committee to take power  to make regulations to determine in what circumstances days shall be treated as days ofholiday and to provide that unemployed persons may obtain benefit in respect of  aperiod which is one of holiday for employed persons.6.  The saving to the Unemployment Fund by the adoption of the Statutory Committee &amp;proposals regarding the payment of benefit at times of holiday is estimated to beof the order of  400,000 a year (S 35 of the Committee&apos;s Report).   The committee report (S 56) that in view of the proposed restrictions upon the payment ofbenefit at holiday periods it would be reasonable to relax the rules in anotherdirection.   At present a &quot;waiting time&quot; of three days of unemployment in respectof which benefit is not paid, is required if the claimant has not been umemployed for three days out of six within the past ten weeks.   The Committee suggest thatthis period of ten weeks might now be increased to twenty weeks - at an estimated cost to the Unemployment Fund of  600,000 a year.   The  opinion is widely held that the rules in regard to the waiting time tend to operate harshlyand I propose to accept the Committee&apos;s suggestion.   On balance therefore theUnemployment Fund will bear an additional charge of some  200,000  a year.7.  Contributions and Paid Holidays.       V                          1     Under the existing legislation contributions are payable under theUnemployment, Health and Pensions schemes when remuneration is paid in respect ofa holiday.   It is represented on behalf of the National Confederation ofEmployers&apos; Organisations that such contributions ought not to be payable.Accepting, however, the principle that holidays should be treated  as an incident                                   2.
 of employment, and in view of the facts that employers who have given their workpeople paid holidays for a number of years have paid the contributions as a matter of course, and that the loss of contributions in respect of paid holidays would involve a serious loss of income for the Insurance schemes, I propose to accept the recommendation of the majority of the Statutory Committee (S 42) that insurance contributions should continue to be paid in respect of paid holidays. But many recent schemes of holiday payments are drafted so as to avoid the making of a payment &quot;in respect of&quot; the holiday.   The payments are described as deferred wages or as gratuitous with the result that contributions under the insurance schemes are not payable in respect of them.   It is clearly necessary to prevent such evasions and I propose to adopt the Statutory Committee&apos;s recommendation (i 42) that contributions should be paid if the workman receives payment with a view to expenditure during any holiday period either from the employer or from any fund to which the employer contributes and whether the payment is made in respect of that period or not.   The legislation in respect of the payment of contributions under the Unemployment, Health and Pensions schemes is in similar terms.   The Minister of Health has informed me that he desires to make similar- amendments in the lav/ relating to Health and Pensions contributions.   He proposes, and I concur, that these amendments should if possible be made in the Bill for which I should be responsible. 8.  Benefit and Payments by Employers to their workpeople.     Section 72 of the Unemployment Insurance Act 1935 permits organised bodies of employers and workpeople to submit for approval by the Minister of Labour schemes for paying to insured contributors in any industry, while they are in receipt of benefit, an additional sum in respect of unemployment.   In the absence of such an approved scheme payments ma.de by an individual employer to a suspended or discharged employee disqualify the employee from receiving benefit in respect.of the periods for which the payments are made.   The Statutory Committee, after considering evidence as to the practice of certain large employers, have recommended (sS 47 and 50) &quot;that the existing provision for supplementary benefit under industrial schemes be widened, so that payments during suspension made inaccordance with regulations of the Minister of Labour, shall not of themselvesinvolve either liability for insurance contributions or cessation of unemploymentbenefit during the period of suspension&quot;.   I propose to adopt this recommendation.
110    9.   Supplementary, Schemes of Unemployment Insurance.   (1 72 of the         Unemployment  Insurance Act, 1955).         I expect  shortly  to receive from  the Joint Committee for the Building Industry    in  England  and  Wales  a scheme to provide for  &quot;Wet Time&quot;.   It is proposed that    contributions shall be collected compulsorily from employers and workpeople in the    Building industry to  provide a fund out of which payments may be made to workpeople    whbse employment  is interrupted by inclement  weather but in such a way that the    &quot;Wet Time&quot;  payments will not be made  for days for which unemployment benefit is    payable.    I  am advised that Section  72 of the Unemployment Insurance Act - under    which such  schemes may upon approval  be given the force of law - is not drawn in    terms wide  enough to  enable the proposed &quot;scheme to be  approved.   I propose to    amend the Section in  order to remove  doubt whether an  approved scheme may be    confined to certain classes of -workpeople and also to  extend the definition of the    industry to which a scheme may be applied by  permitting the inclusion therein of    the appropriate branches or departments of any undertaking whatever their general    character.-    This will enable me to accept the Building Industry&apos;s scheme for    examination and public enquiry;  it will not  imply approval of the proposals.    10.   Training of  Serving Soldiers.          Curing the last  year the vocational training of serving soldiers has been    transferred from  the  Yar Office to the Ministry of Labour.   At present this    training is being carried out on an agency ba.sis for the War Office which has    sufficient  covering powers.   The Ministry&apos;s  statutory power to give training is    at  present  limited to the unemployed, and it  is considered necessary that express    statutory authority should be obtained for the arrangements actually in operation.    This will entail  that the financial charge for this training will be transferred    from the Vote of  the  Yar Office to the Vote of the Ministry, although the    Yar Office  will continue to be financially responsible for the pay and other    allowances  of the soldiers diiring training.   The proposed provision will cover the    training of serving members of any of the Forces.    11.    I  propose also  to amend the Unemployment Insurance Acts upon several matters           i,    of  detail with  which  I need not trouble my colleagues  at this stage.    12.   I desire the consent of my colleagues to the introduction of a Bill upon the    lines which I have indicated.                                          (Initd.)

  UNEMPLOYMENT  INSURANCE ACTS,  1935 to  1938.Report of the Unemployment  Insurance  Statutory Committee    as to Holidays and Suspensions in relation to Unemployment    Insurance.To the Rt.  Hon. Ernest Brown, M.C., M.P.,      Minister of Labour.Sir,  i.  In April last you referred to the Unemployment insurance statutory Committee for consideration and advice in accordancewith section 57  (1)  of the  Unemployment Insurance  Act of1935, the question whether any change should be made in theUnemployment Insurance Acts  in  relation to holidays andperiods of suspension from work.  In doing so,  you called our attention to a passage in a report  recently presented to you by  Ithe Committee on Holidays with Pay, which runs&quot; as follows:        &apos;&apos; With the development of holidays with pay in industry    it seems  to  us  that the  provisions in the Insurance Acts    respecting unemployment  benefit and payment of contri-    butions during  the period of a paid holiday  should be  . reconsidered  with  a view to amendment,  as well as the    question of benefit during an unpaid holiday.&quot;  2.  On 3rd May, 1938, you gave notice in the  Press, and other-wise, of the reference to us  and of  the matters into which wewould enquire,  stating that representations on these matters should be made to us by 31st May.  We have  received repre-sentations in writing or orally from the bodies and organisationsset out below, as well as from  a number of individuals:     National Confederation of Employers&apos; Organisations.    Trades Union Congress  General Council.    The Parliamentary Committee of the Co-operative Congress.     National Joint Industrial Council for the Flour  Milling       Industry.     National Chamber of Trade.     National Federation  of  Grocers&apos;   and  Provision  Dealers&apos;?       Associations.     Glass Manufacturers&apos; Federation.     Messrs. Lever Bros, and Unilever Limited.     Messrs. Geo. Davidson and Company Limited, Gateshead;     Messrs. John Horn  (Stockport) Limited, Stockport,     Messrs. Rowntree  and Company Limited, York.     Messrs. J. and P. Coats, Limited, Glasgow.     Messrs. Zan, Limited, Sandbach.     Mr. George Buchanan,  M.P.     National Society of Pottery Workers.

Ministry of Labour, Northern Ireland.   We have had laid before us also memoranda giving the experi- ence of  officers of the Ministry of Labour in dealing with theI various  questions included in  our reference and we have inter- viewed  representatives of  the Ministry  of Labour  and the Ministry of Health.  We have considered  the questions referred to us at six meetings from gth June to 28th July and now submiti our report and advice upon them.i   3. It  will  be seen  that the reference to us covers  not only&quot;holidays but suspensions from work of other kinds, and we deal&apos;jat  a later stage  with certain  problems put to  us in regard  to^suspension.   The  main issue, however,  is the treatment  ofI holidays, whether with pay or without pay.I   4. In  regard to holidays, questions of two distinct types arise.I First, we have to consider whether and under what circum-jstances,  during a period&quot; which appears to be  one of holiday,1 contributions are now paid or  should be paid.  Second, we have i to  consider  whether  and under  what  circumstances  during  aI period which appears to be one of holiday, benefit is now paidior should be paid. We take  the last of these questions first  asIjthat which at the present time causes most difficulty.i         Unemployment and  Benefit During Holidays.I  5. The  term &quot; holiday &quot; is not used in the  UnemploymentiInsurance Acts,  but  in order to  establish a claim  to  benefit a^workman must show, among other things, (a) that he has madeHa claim  to benefit in the prescribed manner and since that timeIhas been  continuously unemployed, (&amp;)  that he is capable  ofj work and available  for  work.  In  the  administration of the^Unemployment Insurance Acts,  accordingly, questions of holi-lidays arise in the form of the  questions as to whether a person[who is not working during a particular period which appears  toIbe one  of holiday is to be regarded as  &quot; unemployed &quot;  and1&quot; available for work &quot;.I  6. The practice in regard to both these points is now regulatediby a number of decisions of the Umpire.  In general terms, the j-effect of these decisions is that a  claimant, though not working, Is  not &quot;unemployed&quot;  so  as to be entitled to benefit either %a) on  days recognised by custom  or agreement  as holidays
(whether or not any payment is made to him by the employer),or (&amp;)*on days for which, in accordance with the customary orexpressly agreed terms of his employment,  he receives wages,whether in whole or in part.  7. This general statement of cases in which a claimant is held to be not &apos;&apos; unemployed &apos;&apos; and excluded from benefit at holidayperiods is subject to two exceptions.  First, a workman whoseemployment has terminated before an unpaid holiday period istreated as unemployed and may  receive benefit during thatperiod, in spite of the fact that it is a recognised or  customaryholiday.  Second,  an unpaid recognised holiday for which  no benefit is payable is nevertheless treated as  a period of  unemploy-ment for the purpose of preserving continuity of unemployment.It may count as part of the waiting time  before benefit begins,or if it occurs after a waiting time has been served already maymake another waiting time unnecessary and cause benefit to bepaid for  other days on which otherwise it could not  have been paid.  8. In  order to obtain benefit  a  workman must not only beunemployed but must prove that he is unemployed and that heis available for work.   As regards proof of unemployment, thegeneral  test is  that of signing a register at  the employment exchange (or a Trade Union Office) in working hours. WhenUnemployment Insurance was introduced in 1911, and when itwas made general in 1920, it was contemplated that, except wherethe Exchange was at a distance from the workman&apos;s home, dailyproof of  unemployment would be required.  By the  regulations made under the Unemployment Insurance Act of 1920,  aninsured  contributor desiring to obtain  benefit was required toattend at the appropriate local office of the Ministry of labour to sign the unemployed register  on every working day, unless he  lived more than two miles from the office.  If living  morethan two but less than four miles from the office  he had toattend on alternate days;  if living more  than four  miles fromthe office he might attend less often.  In the depression of  1921,the number of claimants became  so great  as to make  it adminis-tratively impossible to enforce  this regulation.  It  was neces-sarily relaxed  and the relaxation has been continued to  thepresent  day;   the regulation now  in force contains  wordsempowering the Minister &quot; for good cause &quot; to direct that less frequent attendance and signature than  those specified in  the regulation shall suffice.  Very general use has been made of this power and  continues to be made. A return  obtained by  theMinistry in  1935 showed that 79-0 per cent, of the  men givingproof of unemployment were required  to attend on  two days aweek, and 11-9 per cent, were required  to attend on three days aweek.  Among women more frequent attendance was enforced;50-1 per cent,  were  required  to attend twice  a  week, 31,.. 7
per cent,  thrice,  and 8-1  per cent, four days  a week.  Formen and  women alike the daily signature originally requiredfor everyone  living within two miles  of  an Exchange, and still  formally  provided  for  in the  regulations, has  to  allintents  and  purposes disappeared.  For the  overwhelming majority of men,  signature twice  a week, including one dayon which they attend to draw benefit, has become the rule.  Onthe days on which he attends, the workman is required to declare that he has been unemployed also on the days when he doesnot attend.  It should be added that in country districts proof of unemployment is given largely by letter signed  by theclaimant and countersigned by two householders.  There is alsoa regular procedure for excusal of  signature on particular days in cases where otherwise it would be required; this as  statedbelow is used largely at holiday periods.  9. As regards availability for work, this has been the subjectof a good many Umpire&apos;s decisions.  The decisions relevant tothe present enquiry are those defining the  conditions  underwhich a man may be held to be available for work even though he is living for a time away from the  locality where he lives and  works.  The substantial  result is that a workman  away from home may still be held to be  available for work, providedthat, by leaving his name and  address at the Exchange or otheragency through which he normally  obtains employment, he putshimself in  a position to be summoned for work, does nothing to make it impossible or difficult for him to return and indicates that he is willing to return  if summoned for work.  10. To  complete  this brief  outline of the present treatmentof holidays under unemployment  insurance,  it is  necessary toexplain more fully the working of  the two exceptions named inparagraph 7 above.  11. As is said above, a workman who has definitely lost his employer before a recognized holiday period is treated duringthe recognized period  as unemployed.  The question whetheremployment has terminated, or should be treated as terminated,is not  always easy to determine,  particularly  in  cases  wherecasual employment is the rule.  Where, for instance (as withdock labourers and ship repairers), employment is by the job,so that employment in a sense may terminate with every jobof a few days&apos;, or a few hours&apos;, duration, the problem of whethera workman whose last job has finished just before a  recognisedholiday should or should not be treated as discharged, so thathe can get benefit during the holiday, is not an easy one.  Todeal with this, the Umpire has  adopted a rule that if a workmanreturns  to the same employer  within 12 days (exclusive  of the days of holiday), he should in general be treated as not havingbeen discharged, whereas, if he does not so return, he is treatedas discharged; for  this purpose a group  of similar  employers   i323i                                              A 2
in a casual industry is sometimes regarded as a single employer.This rule is not itself unreasonable, and is applied in the treat-ment of several other questions arising in unemployment in-surance, such as the trade dispute disqualification. In its nature,however,  the rule implies that the question whether or  not a workman affected by it can get benefit in respect of a recognisedholiday period  (say Good Friday to Easter Monday) can onlybe answered some days after the holiday.  Moreover the answerthen may  depend upon whether  on or before the 12th day the workman takes work with a particular employer  or one of aparticular group of employers, or  contrives to avoid doing so,or goes to  a different employer.   If he  goes back to the sameemployer within the 12 days period he loses benefit for the holi-day days  even  though he himself was anxiously seeking workon  them.   If he goes to a different employer or continues to evade  any offer of work for 12 days, he gets benefit for the holiday days, though he may in fact have been away at the sea-side.   As it was put to us in evidence, in such cases the work-man sometimes  says:  &quot; I am not going back to my formeremployer yet because I shall lose my holiday pay.&quot; Cases ofthis kind are probably not common but they are possible and do occur sometimes.  12. The other exception, that days of recognised holiday maycount for continuity of unemployment, though not for benefit,was admitted by an Umpire &apos;s decision in 1921 with a view to preventing hardship under provisions both as to continuity andas to length of  waiting time different from those now in force,and became an established rule  of practice.   In reviewing theposition in 1927, the Umpire observed that &quot; this rule of prac-tice may be somewhat illogical but it is  convenient  and  avoidshardship and has long been followed.&quot;  He  upheld the ruleaccordingly both then and in a later decision of 1928, in  spiteof an intervening change in the wording of the conditions forunemployment  benefit.    The point was considered again atsome length by the Royal Commission  on Unemployment In-surance, who took the view that holidays should not count asunemployment  either for benefit or for  continuity.  A clauseto give effect to this view, and  negative the Umpire&apos;s rule of practice, was included accordingly  in the Unemployment Insur-ance Bill of 1934,  but  was withdrawn as the result  of criticismin the  House of Commons, directed to showing that the changeof law proposed, under the  provisions then in force as to con-discontinuity and length of waiting time,  might cause hardship in par-ticular cases by restricting unduly the drawing of benefit,;  13. These, in broad outline,  are the legal provisions nowaffecting the treatment of holiday periods in relation to the re-ceipt of unemployment benefit.  The evidence presented to usleaves it beyond question that under these provisions consider-able numbers of persons are recorded as unemployed in respect
of periods during which they are on holiday, that is to say arerecruiting their health and seeking enjoyment rather than seek-ing work.  Some of these are persons  falling under the firstexception named above in paragraph 7;  that is to say they arepeople whose employment had terminated before the holidaybegan.   But  there is also the formal admission of recognisedholidays as days of unemployment for the purpose of continuity of unemployment though  not of benefit, and there are severalways in  which it is possible now for days of holiday to countas days of unemployment and attract payment of benefit, eventhough  employment has  not terminated before the holidaybegins.-  14. At the  time of the Umpire&apos;s original decision in 1921 ad-mi putting recognised holidays as days of unemployment for con-discontinuity, and  when the question  was debated in the  House ofCommons in  1934, the waiting time to be  served at the beginningof each period of continuous unemployment was six days. Underthe present law, with the waiting time reduced to three  days,the decision leads both to great inconvenience of administration and to anomalies.&apos;  15. The inconvenience is that when there have been two days of recognised holidays, say Christmas Day and Boxing Day,counting automatically for continuity of  unemployment,  on theday following thousands of people in a  particular district may still be not working  (in effect on holiday) but  may proceed to register  at the Exchange in order to complete  their  waitingperiod.   If there have  been three days of recognised holiday-say Good Friday, Easter  Saturday and  Easter Monday theremay be  thousands of people still really on holiday on Tuesdaywho will sign as for that day  to get benefit for it.  In each casethe Exchange machinery is threatened with dislocation.  This isone of the unexpected  but direct consequences  of the reduction-since April,  1937, of the  waiting time from six days to three days.  16. As regards anomalies, these are sufficiently illustrated by-a case, which was given to us in evidence, of two sisters who were both in the same employment, one of whom lost her employmentthree days before&apos; Good Friday and remained unemployed untilthe following Thursday, or nine days in all,  while her sisterremained in  work until the Thursday before Good Friday andwas then out of work until the following  Monday week, also fornine days in all.  The first of these served her waiting period before Good  Friday but could not get benefit for Friday, Satur-day and Monday being recognised holidays, and was able, there-fore,  to  get only three days  on benefit  out of the nine  of notworking: . Her sister was able to serve her waiting period on the recognised holidays  of Friday, Saturday and  Monday, began-drawing benefit  on Easter Tuesday, and  in her  nine days of    13231                                              A 3
not working,  obtained benefit for  six days.  The mother  ofthe two daughters, perhaps  not  unreasonably,  declined  toBelieve that one of  the daughters had received benefit only forthree  days, thought that the daughter must have deceived herand wrote to the Employment Exchange to find out if the  factscould be as her daughter stated.  Anomalies of this ldnd  arisedirectly and inevitably from the inconsistent treatment of  holi-days  as being  days of unemployment for some purposes butnot for  others.  17.  Of the ways  in which it is possible for persons actuallyon holiday to draw benefit it will be sufficient here to mentionthree.  18.  First, in  the absence of  statutory regulation or publishedagreement between the employer and the workmen, it takessome  time for  a period to  become  recognised as a customaryholiday.  We had brought to  our attention a number of cases in which employers had  regularly shut their works for several days at the same time every year, announcing it as a holiday,but not until this had been going on for five, or in some casesmany more years,  had the Umpire held that the holiday had become established  by custom.  The effect of this is that,  afterworkmen have  got into the habit of receiving benefit for a  par-ticular period  of suspension year after year for  several years,they then find  themselves deprived of benefit under  preciselysimilar  conditions,  on the ground that the period has  now become one of customary holiday.   In reality it may have  beenaccepted and treated as  a  holiday  throughout.  19.  Second, in so far  as the incidence of holiday  depends,not upon statute, but upon express agreement between employersand workmen,  the evidence given to us makes it clear that theterms of agreement in many cases have either been  drawnoriginally, or revised later,  so  as to  reduce the period of formalholiday to  a minimum with  a view to making  it possible forworkpeople to obtain benefit for as many days as possible which,in practice, were days  of  holiday.  One  of  the most strikingillustrations of  this  was the decision of a local Miners&apos; Associa-tion in Lancashire by ballot vote to forego all holidays exceptChristmas Day and Good Friday.  All the pits concerned  con-tinued, after this ballot, as before it, to stop work for the whole ofa local holiday week; the effect and obvious intention of the votewas to secure benefit for these days of stoppage.  In another case in Lancashire a similar change of form withoutchange of practice followed on the passing of a colliery into newownership.  The colliery  had  always observed  as holidaysChristmas Day, Boxing Day,  three days at Easter, seven  daysannual holiday at Whitsuntide and August Bank Holiday.  Thenew  owner declared that  the only recognised  Holidays  wereChristmas Day and Good Friday, but the former holiday periods
  continue to be periods of non-working, and benefit is paid for  them in spite of the fact that preparation is made for the Whit-  sun tide stoppage by a &quot; holiday- fund &quot; at the Colliery.    In a Scottish town, a  seven days&apos; summer holiday has been  customary for more than 20 years, but in 1934 it was agreed at  a conference that &apos;&apos; statutory holidays should be for three days  only, namely Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and that any other  days on which a factory was closed should not be treated as  statutory holidays &quot;.   The period of holiday actually observed  continues to be seven days, but  under a Court of Referees&apos;  decision benefit is paid for all except the &quot;statutory &quot; days.    In another Scottish town there is a similar agreement with the  object in view plainly stated: &quot; for the purpose of unemploy-  ment  insurance  the customary holidays will be eight  days  throughout the year, namely four days at the  Fair period and  four days at the New Year period &quot;.  The actual stoppage in  the town during the Fair period is, and always has been, seven  days.                &apos;               ?    The cases named above are in no sense unusual.  Substantially  similar cases are found in all parts of the country. Everywhere  is seen a tendency for  employers  and workmen to agree  to  shorten holidays, openly or implicitly, &quot; for the purpose  of unemployment insurance &quot;.    20. Third, the fact that people who are really on holiday can  and do endeavour  to treat this as  a period of unemployment either for the serving, or for the avoidance of, a waiting time, or for the obtaining  of benefit, has itself brought about a relaxation- tion of administrative regulations at holiday seasons.  The pro- visions as to proof of unemployment by signature of the unem- ployed register at an Exchange, having been  reduced in most cases to a  normal requirement of two signatures a week, are reduced still further, because the  attempt to enforce them and require or permit mass attendance of all the workers in a factory or a town at the Exchange on days  of holiday, would cause an administrative break-down.I   In the recognised holidays which, though they do not countI for benefit,  do  (as stated above) count for continuity of unem-Iploymenf,&apos; there is a common practice for Exchanges to excuseI signature wholesale; that is to say, to announce that Easteri Monday or Christmas Day or Boxing  Day will be  treated asla day  of unemployment  for everybody without  his signing. Persons wanting to leave a district for holiday purposes, withoutIfailing to prove unemployment during their absence, are able toImake and  do  make applications in advance  for excusal of; signature during their absence.  This  is the alternative  to an[earlier  procedure by  which  motor charabancs  used to run[regularly from seaside resorts like Blackpool to industrial centres
taking holiday makers twice weekly to sign their registers. the requirement of availability for work is met by leaving an addressbehind before going to the sea-side.  21.  The position revealed by our enquiries is in many waysunsatisfactory.   It is not, we are sure, in accord either with thepurposes for which Unemployment Insurance was established,or with responsible public opinion, that unemployment benefit,directly or indirectiy, should become a form of holiday pay.Though holiday leisure is not by name excluded from unemploy-ment in the Unemployment Insurance Acts,  it is excluded by implication: by  the  formal requirement of daily signature  asproof of unemployment still standing in the Regulations  as thenormal procedure, and by the requirement of availability forwork.  The various decisions of the Umpire excluding holidaysin a number of cases from the computation of unemployment area reasonable recognition  of this  fact.  But  they  cannot beregarded as a satisfactory settlement of the issue. The extent towhich, under the present law, holiday leisure can be converted into unemployment for the purpose of insurance is already pro-ducing many anomalies and is bringing the insurance scheme into disrepute.  22. Both the disrepute and the anomalies will be accentuatedin time to  come  by the  contemplated  and highly desirabledevelopment of holidays with pay.  The report of the Committeeon Holidays with Pay has rightly called attention to the necessityof re-defining the position in regard to unemployment insurance,as an accompaniment to the recognition of paid holidays as  a normal incident  of  employment.   Obviously  a workman  inreceipt of pay for a holiday ought not to be able to draw unem-ployment benefit as well.   But to  allow decision for or againstunemployment benefit in  a holiday period to turn directly on whether or  not  the  workman is receiving any pay from the employer for that period  would set up undesirable re-actions.First, it would act to some extent as a deterrent to the grantof paid holidays, or  at least as an excuse for  evading such  agrant. Employers unwilling to meet the expense of holiday pay would leave their workmen  to draw  benefit; other  employers of more public spirit would be at a disadvantage. Second,  itmight lead to arrangements designed to give pay for holidaysin substance without doing so in form, with the object either ofsecuring benefit for the workman  or of avoiding contributions.There are indications already of movements in this direction, of presenting holiday pay in the light of  &quot; deferred pay &quot; for pre-vious periods in place of for the holiday itself.  Though, on suchcases as have come before him up to the present, the Umpirehas been able to deal with such arrangements according to thesubstance and not according to the form, the  position should beput by legislation beyond dispute.  Unless  the position is defined
IT;there is likely to be continuous pressure upon employers grantingpay for holidays to grant it in a foKtn making possible the draw-.ing of unemployment benefit as well.  And there will be a sense of injustice  if  employers giving  holiday  pay from their  ownfunds find other  employers giving holidays  without pay, inreliance on the benefit which their workmen  may contrive todraw.  In order to clear the ground for the  development of holidays with pay from the  employer as an incident of employ-ment, and to forestall the undesirable developments  suggested above, it is essential to secure that holidays, whether or not theyare paid for by the employer, cannot be taken with pay from theUnemployment Fund, on the plea of being unemployment.  23.  In saying this we do not question  either the desirability-of every workman having a  definite period of rest and recreationevery year or  the necessity that  he should have an income to spend in that period,  if he  is to  gain advantage from it.   nor have we failed to consider the suggestion  that formal  provisionof such an income might be made, in part  at least, for every-body from the Unemployment Fund, that is to say that Unem-ployment  Insurance might become Unemployment and HolidayInsurance. This suggestion in our view is wrong in  principle.The workman on his week or fortnight  of recreative holidayshould be  regarded as being as much  in continuing employment as in  his  daily hours of rest and  recreation.   But apart fromprinciple,  and even if the Fund  were financially in a positionto bear  the  additional liability,  the suggestion would be opento a fatal administrative objection;  that  it would compel theExchanges to make a payment at least once a year and aboutthe same period of the year to the  whole  industrial population.Such a proposal is impracticable. Employers  are making pay-ments of wages weekly to the whole industrial population and itis through the  employers alone, and directly, that payments forholidays  can  be  made.  Holidays should  be  treated  as  anincident of employment.  Unemployment Insurance should be confined to unemployment.  24.  Whether paid or not  paid for by the employer, a day ofholiday should not be treated as a day of  unemployment unless it can be presumed, of any particular workman, that  he wouldhave been unemployed on that day and without any  pay fromthe employer,  even if it had not  been a holiday. That is ageneral principle which  in  our opinion would commend itselfto the serious opinion of employers and employees alike. Howcan the principle be applied, and what problems arise  in apply-ing it?  Substantially the problems are those  of  defining whatis meant by &quot; holiday &quot;, and of defining the  grounds for thepresumption that the  workman  would have been unemployedeven apart from any holiday.
   25. To the question  what we mean by  a &quot; holiday,&quot; the answer is best given in stages.       (a) There are general holidays,  extending with local ex-     exceptions either to England as a whole (Good Friday and the     Bank Holidays of Easter Monday, Whit Monday, August     Monday, Christmas Day and Boxing Day) or to Scotland     as a whole (New Year&apos;s Day).   These are usually isolated     days or at most two days together.       (&amp;) There are local holidays established by  custom in     certain  districts or industries typified by the annual Wakes     or  summer  holidays of most northern  towns, and lasting     often a week or more, though there are also  occasional     isolated days  of district holiday.  According to  the  Com-     mittee on Holidays  with Pay  &quot; in most industrial centres     throughout the United Kingdom (excluding the Metropolis)     some week during the summer months  is generally recog-     nised as a holiday week.&quot;       (c) There are  holidays clearly resting on agreement, ex-     press or implied, between employers and employees in  a     particular industry or a particular firm.       (d) There are other times when a particular  workman     may  personally be  on  holiday, irrespective of what his     fellows  are doing.  26. So far is  fairly  easy  going.   The  general holidays are&quot;known.  The local holidays actually observed as times of notworking by  the great bulk of employers and employees in a dis-trict or industry can be established though it may be necessaryto provide that these shall be  treated  as holidays irrespective of any agreement  of employers and employees, so as to  avoidagreements  such as those illustrated in  paragraph 19 above, to forego holidays in  name while preserving  them in reality.  the holidays for which agreement between employers and  employeescan be established  will presumably grow in numbers,  as pay forholidays becomes commoner.   It is necessary however to draft the  definition of holidays so  as to avoid the  terms &quot; recog-nised &quot; and &quot; customary &quot;, with the implication that a  cessation-tion of work must be  observed for a  number of years before it can become a holiday.  The present procedure, whereby  it takes 7 or 10 years to establish a holiday as a custom, so thatbenefit is paid for  the six or nine years  and is stopped suddenlyin the 7th or 10th years, produces the maximum of friction. the growing up  of vested interests in benefit as provision for holidaysshould be prevented.  The other times  when a workman is per-sonally on holiday can be ascertained  by enquiry and can be tested by strict application of the requirements for proof ofunemployment and of availability  for work.   27. The difficulties of defining a  &quot; holiday &quot; centre largely,though not wholly,  round  the question  of  its  length.  Some-times while the  Wakes  or other holiday week of a district  is
well-established and general, it becomes common for an addi-tional  day usually the Saturday before to be added to the stoppage by some firms though not by  all.  Again  at the gen-eral holiday periods of Easter, Whit-week and Christmas manyfirms adopt a practice of stopping for  additional days some-times in all or most years,  sometimes only in years of bad trade.Even when a firm regularly declares a  &quot; holiday &quot; each year,e.g., by stopping for all days from Christmas to New Year, orfor a week or more in summer,  this may be essentially a con-venience to the firm (for stock-taking  or repairs) and  a timeof distasteful idleness and loss of wages to the employees.  Toaccept a unilateral declaration of a &quot; holiday &apos;&apos; by the employer is to incur the risk of letting genuine unemployment go withoutbenefit.  On the other hand, to insist that a time of  stoppageshall not be treated as a &quot;  holiday &apos;&apos; unless it is formally agreed as such by both parties, opens the door to agreements to disagreeand turn what are really holidays into recorded and remuneratedunemployment.   To this dilemma there  is no complete solution.But the difficulties are  likely to  become less in scope  and inseverity in proportion as holidays with  pay become general.  28. To  the question of the grounds  on which presumptionshould be made that a workman would  have been unemployedeven if there had been no holiday, the answer is also given bestin stages.      (1)  If the workman has been in receipt of unemployment    benefit or assistance for any substantial period before the    beginning of a holiday, it is reasonable, lacking  evidence    to the contrary, to assume that the  state of unemployment    would have continued.      (2)  If he falls out of work so shortly before the holiday    that the prospect of the holiday may be regarded as already    affecting the situation, the contrary presumption may be    made again lacking  evidence to the contrary.  If he re-    sumes work very soon after  the holiday, the presumption    that he would not have been unemployed but for the holi-    day is strengthened.   If he fails for  a substantial time after    the holiday to  obtain  work, the presumption is weakened    and may be held to be rebutted.  29. The foregoing considerations obviously lead up to some-thing like  the &quot; 12  days&apos; rule &quot;, and it  is not clear that some-thing on the lines of that rule can be avoided altogether, in spiteof the criticisms which may be made against it.  The 12 days&apos;rule, however, in its present form is used as a guide to answer,not the question whether the workman would have been unem-ployed even apart from the holiday,  but the different questionwhether a v/orkman has  been &quot; finally discharged &quot;  by  hisformer employer or has only been suspended;- a distinction ismade accordingly in the treatment of holidays,  between men
returning to the same employer or employing group in 12 days.,*nd those obtaining work elsewhere.   This  distinction  leads toanomalies in trades like ship-repairing, with frequent change ofemployers, and is not relevant to the real issue: whether the pre-sumption is that the workman  would have been unemployed in the holiday if it had not been a holiday.   If anything corre-sponding to the 12  days&apos; rule is retained, no distinction shouldbe  drawn between  cases where  a workman returns to the oldemployer and those where he goes to a different employer withinthe specified limit of time.  30. It will be seen that in laying down in paragraph 24 theprinciple on which treatment of holidays should proceed, we haveexpressed the view  that holidays, as  defined and subject  to ex-ception on presumption, should not count  as  unemployment.We have not limited ourselves to saying that they should not count for benefit.  It is, perhaps, not irrelevant to observe that,in interpreting the same statutory words, the Umpire in NorthernIreland has taken a  different view from the Umpire in  GreatBritain.  Recognised holidays in Northern Ireland do not counteither for benefit or for continuity of unemployment. We thinkthat the opposite view taken by the Umpire in Great  Britain,and the resulting distinction whereby  holidays may count forcontinuity of unemployment though not for benefit, should nowbe  negatived by statute.    Whatever  the justification for the rule adopted by the Umpire in the past,  the position in regardto possible hardship has been changed radically by the reductionof  the waiting  time from six days to three days.   With thatreduction the rule, as explained above,  produces indefensibleanomalies and inconveniences.   If there is to be a waiting time at all, that is to say,  days at the beginning  of a period of con-tinuous unemployment for which benefit is not payable, theyshould be days of genuine unemployment in all cases, and  not of genuine  unemployment for  some people  while they are  days of holiday for others.  If the rules defining a continuous periodof unemployment are felt either to be needlessly strict in general or  to  work hardship  in particular  cases, they  should be amended openly, in place  of being negatived covertly by use of holidays to  maintain continuity; we make  a specific proposalbelow on this point.  Finally, in so far as  holidays with lossof wages are for poorly paid workpeople a hardship rather thana means of recreation,  the  cases of hardship will be  reduced in proportion as paid holidays become general.  31. Holidays in our view should not count as unemploymenteither for benefit or to maintain continuity.   On the other  hand,they should not be allowed to  break continuity of unemploy-ment.   They should not count as days at all  for the&apos;purposes ofunemployment  insurance;  that is to say, they should be treatedas Sundays.    .
  32. The way to a satisfactory solution of the problems sur-veyed above lies in drawing a sharp distinction between holidays and unemployment.  The principle is clear  and should now be embodied in  the  statutory conditions  defining unemployment.But the application of the  principle to the infinitely  varyingconditions of industrial life involves questions of detail  forwhich some flexibility  of procedure is required. Legislation onthe subject referred to us and some legislation  is obviouslyneeded should take the form of laying down the general prin-ciple that holidays are not unemployment, while leaving detains to be worked out in  regulations,  to be made  by the  ordinaryprocedure, involving report by ourselves after  receipt  of repre-sentations from employers and workpeople.  33. We suggest accordingly that an early opportunity shouldbe taken of inserting in the Unemployment Insurance  Acts an appropriate section dealing with holidays, on the following lines:  Except as  may be  provided by regulations made under thissection an insured person shall not be deemed to be unemployed on  any of his days of holiday, and any such day of holidayshall be treated  as non-existent for the purpose of reckoningcontinuity  of unemployment.  The  Minister of Labour shall make  regulations to determinein what circumstances days  shall be treated  as  days of holiday,and to provide that persons who have lost  employment beforethe holiday may, subject to prescribed conditions,  obtain bene-fit during a holiday period.  Such regulations may among other things  provide that the following shall be  held to be  days  ofholiday         .   \    -   (i) any day which has commonly been observed or which     there is  reasonable cause to  believe is being observed  in     respect of an insured person &apos;s grade or class at his place     of employment as a time of cessation of work primarily for     the purpose  of rest or recreation;       :. -:.x....       (ii) - any day on which the insured person is personally     devoting himself to rest or recreation.  34. We are confident that legislation, followed by the making of regulations on the lines indicated above, would make  theposition in regard to holidays and unemployment insurance far more satisfactory than at present.  But many questions as toapplication of the new provisions to the innumerable complexities of industrial life will  still call  for  decision by the Courts  of referees  and  the  Umpire.  It  would  materially assist  thestatutory authorities in this difficult task if the administrativeprocedure of the Exchanges, in place of being relaxed at holidayseasons, could be tightened up.   It is unfortunate from many points of view that just at these times of year, when the tempta-tion to take what  are really holidays at  the expense of  theUnemployment Fund  becomes  strongest, the  defences  against
                             i6 such procedure  are  now allowed to become  weakest.  The natural flexible means of preventing holidays from masquerading as unemployment is to be rigid in requiring proof of unemploy- ment.  The more carefully the test is applied to the individual case the less need will there be to extend the formal  definition of holidays, with possible hardship to those who do not want and cannot afford holidays.                      ?:   35. If the proposals made above are adopted, workmen will fail  to obtain benefit in some cases in which they do obtain it under present conditions.  Days of holiday will be excluded from benefit;  their exclusion also from counting for  continuity will deprive workmen of benefit for some days of genuine unemploy- ment, as being waiting time.  It is impossible to make any exact estimate of  the expenditure  upon benefit which  would thus  be saved,  but  we are advised that it would  be of the  order  of  400,000 a  year.  Almost the whole of this  sum represents pay- ments of benefit for one, two, or three days, to workpeople who are suspended from work  at holiday periods and  return to work immediately thereafter, together with a proportion of work- people who finish a  substantial period of  employment at the holiday. In addition, an appreciable  sum would  be  saved  in the  cost of administration,  which  is  high in relation to the payment of small amounts of benefit.   36. Insistence on a waiting time at the beginning of each spell of continuous unemployment is a well established principle  of most schemes  of  unemployment insurance, whether  adminis- tered by the  State or by associations of  workmen.  But the practical effect of such a provision depends largely on the rules defining continuity of unemployment. In view of the restrictions proposed by us in one direction of  excluding  holidays from counting as  unemployment for continuity it  would be reason- able to  relax the rules in another direction, by  increasing the interval, after an unemployment period of not less than three days,  within  which  a  fresh  waiting  time  should  not berequired.  This interval is now ten weeks.  We estimate thatthe cost to the Unemployment Fund of extending  the interval  to 15 weeks would be about   400,000 a year, that is to say,  sub-stantially equal to the saving on benefit expenditure that would follow from  our proposals in regard to holidays.  To make the interval 20 weeks  in place of 10 would cost about  600,000 ayear, and to make it 26 weeks would cost about  750,000 a year.Having regard to the saving on administration,  and the orderof magnitude of the sums involved, we have little  doubt that theUnemployment Fund could  reasonably be asked to bear thecost of an extension at least to 20 weeks, at the same time as thechange was  made-in  respect of holidays.  37. Though we have discussed the question of  holidays inrelation mainly to workers under&quot; the general  scheme of unem-ployment insurance, our proposals in respect both of  holidays and of the continuity rule apply also to  the agricultural scheme.
                   Contributions in Holidays.    38. We turn to the second of the two questions named above.  How should holiday periods be  reared  in respect of payment  of insurance  contributions?  Liability to pay contributions is  defined by section 8 (4) of the Unemployment Insurance Act,  1935, as follows:        &quot; A weekly contribution  shall  be  payable  for  each      calendar  week during the whole or any  part of which an      employed person has been employed ....        &quot; Provided that:-        &quot; (&amp;) Where no services have been rendered by an em-      ployed person during any week  and no remuneration is      paid in respect of that week, the  employer  shall not be      liable to  pay any contribution either on his  own behalf,      or on  behalf of the employed person in respect  of that      week.&quot;    The position, therefore,  is that  a contribution is payable  for  a period of holiday or suspension if the employer makes  the  worker a  payment, in  respect of the  period, which  can  be  regarded as &quot; remuneration &quot;.    A payment is regarded as  &quot; remuneration &quot; if either         (a) it  is expressly provided for  in the terms of  the      employment, or        (6) it can be regarded as  an  understood  term of  the      employment, e.g., because it is made in consequence of an      established practice, custom or usage, whether of the trade,      of the district, or  of the particular employer concerned.  The payment is not regarded as &quot; remuneration &quot; if it is of a  purely gratuitous nature.    It  is also to be  observed  that  the remuneration, if it is to  attract contributions, must be paid in respect  of the period.  If  it can be shown that in a  particular week  no services  were  rendered and no remuneration was paid  in respect of that week  (e.g., that the payment made  to the workers was simply in  the nature of deferred  pay in respect  of previous weeks of  service),  no contribution is payable.    39. These provisions apply in the same terms to the payment  of unemployment insurance  contributions and of contributions  for health and widows and pensions insurance.  Their effect is  to make contributions unnecessary in holidays  or suspensions of  work without pay, but to require contributions if  pay is given  definitely for the holiday by  agreement express  or  implied.  Employers who have granted paid holidays hitherto have con-  tinued to pay contributions, both for health  and widows andI  pensions insurance and for unemployment insurance, in respect&apos;  of the holiday periods.
                            i8  40. It was urged on us, however, by the National confederation-tion  of Employers&apos;  Organisations, as the unanimous  view oftheir constituent members, that the  requirement of insurance contributions during paid holidays was unjust and impolitic. Itadded  to  the  burden of providing holidays with  pay, whileexempting the employer who  refused such  holidays.   It  was bound to lead to arrangements for masking the reality and forgiving  holiday pay in various disguises &quot; deferred  wages&quot; additions to wages &quot;  &quot; Ex gratia payments &quot;  and the like.There  is weight in  these arguments, and to some of us they appear to be good ground for recommending a change of law,exempting all periods of holiday, paid as well as unpaid, fromliability for insurance contributions.  41. But there  are  strong arguments also on the other side.First, as has  been shown by the Committee on Holidays withFay, a substantial proportion  of all  persons subject to unem-ployment insurance are already enjoying holidays with pay fromtheir employers and have been doing so for many years.  Remis-sion of contributions in respect of those holidays would mean an appreciable loss of present income to  the schemes of health and windows and pensions insurance and  unemployment insurance.Second, it is of the essence of the view taken here that the line between  holidays  and  unemployment should be  marked as strongly as possible.  The  days or.weeks of each year duringwhich  the workman is seeking physical recruitment and recreational-tion in a paid holiday should not break his employment or affectthe incidence of his employment, any more  than do the hoursof each day during which he is equally away from work, in restor recreation. Though the National Confederation of Employers&apos;Organisations  pressed for a change  of the present law, someindividual employers who  had been giving paid holidays formany years took a contrary view; they felt it reasonable to addtheir insurance contributions to the wages paid in holidays, asthey did to the wages paid during working weeks.:  ; 42. In the light of the arguments set out in  the last paragraph,it appears to a majority of us that insurance contributions shouldbe paid in respect of any holiday period if the workman receivespayment, with a view to expenditure during that period, either from the  employer or from any fund to which the employercontributes  for  the  provision  of pay  during holidays,  andWhether the payment is made in respect of that period or not.                      Suspension Pay.-  43.  There remains for consideration one problem arising not from holidays but from payments made by employers duringsuspension from work.  So far as we know, up to the present,the problem has arisen only in three  cases, in the Flour Milling
 Industry  and in the  important  single  firms of Messrs. Lever Brothers  and Unilever  Limited and  Messrs.  Rowntree  and Company, though there may be  other cases also.   44. In the Flour Milling Industry the  Joint Industrial Council have adopted, by formal agreement, the principle of securing to workpeople during stoppages  or short time a continuance of their income, by adding to the unemployment benefit whatever sum is necessary to make it up to the full weekly wages.   The addition is paid  by the individual employer.  It does not apply where the flour mill has been closed for an indefinite period for large scale alterations, or to  absence of employees through illness or their own act, but it applies in all other cases. It has been held by the Umpire that the  supplementary payment by the  employers,  being made under  agreement in respect of service, disqualifies the workman from receipt of benefit.   45. In one of  the other cases, that of Messrs. Lever Brothers and Unilever Limited, the firm has adopted a similar principle of making up the income of employees, during temporary suspension- sion up to a maximum of  13 weeks, to their normal wages.   It is expressly  stated by the firm that the privilege thus  accorded forms no part of the. conditions of employment and may be with- drawn at  any time.   But it has been held by the Ministry of Labour  that&apos;payments so made &quot; in consequence of an estab- lished practice, custom or usage &quot; become part of the employee&apos;s remuneration, so that  contributions  are payable. The employee is held also to be excluded from benefit under section 35 (6) of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1935.  46. In the case of Messrs. Rowntree  and Company  the firm has been in the habit for some time past of making small pay- ments to some of its workers &quot; for periods during which they are not  on holiday but are suspended from work.&quot;  The pay- ment, described  as &quot; short time benefit &quot;, ranges from 2s.  per week for single men to 9s. per week to married men with three or more dependent children; it is confined to  employees who have been with the firm for some time.   The payments in  this case are much smaller than those falling to be made under the Flour Milling scheme  or that of Messrs.  Lever Brothers and Unilever Limited, but appear to raise the same question of prin- ciple as to payments  supplementary to benefit during unem-Iployment.  47. The question thus raised  is one of considerable difficulty. On the one hand it may be argued that it is against sound policy to arrange that men when out of work shall get exactly the same is when in work, since this will  discourage men from seeking work elsewhere  and  increase  unemployment.   On the other tiand unemployment benefit has never been regarded as neces- afily a  sufficient income  during unemployment.  It is  contem- dated that workmen  shall  be  free  to subscribe for additional
benefit through trade unions, and special arrangements are madewith trade unions to encourage the provision of such benefit.Moreover section 72 of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1935,provides expressly for giving of supplementary benefit underschemes adopted for  separate industries.  If the Flour MillingJoint Industrial Council were  to  devise a scheme under thissection, they could make up benefit to wages just as they are doing.  And in so far as  the cost was pooled, in place of falling on the individual employer, it would be more liable than theiractual procedure to lead to the creation of unnecessary unem-ployment.  For various reasons the making of a scheme undersection 72 presents difficulties in the Flour Milling Industry andit would not be open to a single firm like Messrs Lever Brothersand Unilever Limited. On the whole, we believe that there is acase for amendment of the law in the direction of providing thatsupplementary payments during  suspension, made in accord-ance with regulations of the Minister of Labour, should not  betreated as wages so as to destroy a claim to benefit or establishliability to contribute.              Conclusion and Recommendations.  48.  On the main issue before us our recommendation is that parliament should be invited by legislation on  the lines indicatedin paragraph 33 above, to secure that insured persons on holidayshould not be treated  as unemployed, and that power should  begiven to the Minister of Labour, by regulations, to define holidays and to make the necessary exception for persons to whom the holiday comes not as a break in employment but in the courseof unemployment.  As an  accompaniment of this proposal werecommend an extension of the interval within which a freshwaiting period should not be required.  49.  In regard to contributions we recommend, by a majority,that where a paid holiday is granted, insurance contributionsshall continue  to be paid  in respect of the holiday period.  50.  In regard to suspensions of work, we recommend that theexisting provision  for supplementary benefit under industrialschemes be widened, so that payments  during suspension madein accordance  with regulations of the Minister of Labour, shallnot of themselves involve either liability for insurance contribu-tions or cessation of unemployment benefit during the period of suspension.  51.  The various problems under consideration in this report,as we have indicated, are complex and difficult.  Whatever thelaw, there will be some apparent anomalies and hardships.  Thegeneral principle, whose adoption will in our view reduce bothanomalies and hardships to  a minimum, is that of distinguishingclearly between unemployment and holidays,  and securing that
some period each year set aside for rest and recreation, without loss of wages from the employer, shall be regarded as a normalincident of every form of employment.  If this principle is right,it is not irrelevant for us to observe that the problems and diffi-culties which  we have been called  on to consider here willbecome less serious in proportion as  there is general and earlyacceptance  of the  recommendations  of the  Committee  onHolidays with Pay.
