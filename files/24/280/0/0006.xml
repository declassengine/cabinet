CABINET;                    CROPS (PREVENTION OlJ&apos; DAMAGE) BILL.  - ::            Memorandum &quot;by the Minister of Agriculture  and Fisheries, ;&apos;     1.     At its meeting on the 26th January, 1938,  the Cabinet had   before it a joint memorandum by the Secretary of State for Scotland   and myself (C.P.2(38)) regarding the preparation of  a  Rabbits Bill   for introduction into Parliament as soon as ,an opportunity could be   found. I     2.     In a further memorandum, dated 16th February, 1938,   (C.P,36(38)) I suggested,  following on a consultation  with the  Chief   Whip, that no further action should be taken at that time  with   regard to the proposed Bill.      3.     At the meeting of the Cabinet held on 2nd  November,  1938,  it   was decided (Cabinet 52(38), Conclusion 5) to adopt  the recommendation   of the Home  Affairs Committee at its meeting held on  the  26th  October   1938, that a Bill dealing with damage by rabbits would be  suitable  for   introduction by a Private Member.  As the ballot for Private  Members&apos;   Bills takes place this week, the matter is of some urgency, and I have   therefore ventured to assume that my colleagues will agree to&quot;the   preparation of this very desirable Bill and to its being entrusted  to   a Private Member for introduction.\      4.     I should add that the Bill carries out the main   recommendations of the Select Committee of the House of Lords,  which   was appointed in 1936 to consider the question of damage tohillI   agriculture by raboits.  Details of the recommendations embodied in   the Bill will be found under headings (a), (b), (d),&apos; (e) and  (f) of   paragraph 2 of the memorandum CP,2(38) referred to  above.      5\.     I have consulted the  Secretary of State for -Scotland, who   desires the question of the application of the Bill  to Scotland to   be left open for the present.  The Bill has therefore  been so drawn   as not to apply to Scotland, and it is proposed that this  matter   shall be dealt with, if necessary, by an amendment at  a later stage.                                       );M                 W.S.M.3th November, 1938.
