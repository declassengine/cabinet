Pig iron production in October, 1933, amounted to439,400 tons as compared with 429,800 tons in September, 1938,and 769,600 tons in October, 1937.     Iron and steel markets did not show as great an increasein business as the production figures would suggest.   in nearly all branches of the industry it is reported that asubstantial tonnage of orders is withheld from the marketpending the announcement of the future level of prices.     ENGINEERING.  The outlook for the engineering industryis indefinite and the volume of new business has slightlydeclined.   Exports of machinery in October were valued at 4.8 million as compared with  4.6 million in October, 1937,and  4.5 million in September, 1938.     ELECTRICAL INDUSTRY.   Business in October in the largerclasses of plant was about normal.   Orders were placed, however,mostly in the first half of the month and may have representedan accumulation from schemes deferred during the internationalcrisis.     Exports of electrical goods rose in value from  1,650,114in September to  1,844,512 in October.  For the-first  10 monthsof 1938 exports were valued at  17,522,260 as compared with 14,780,185 in the corresponding period of 1937.     MOTOR INDUSTRY.

        HOST-FERROUS METALS.   Prices of  metals  rose  sharply   during the  first half  of  October owing to purchases for   rearmament  and to purchases by consumers and  speculators   encouraged  by the indications  of improving  business in the   United States.    Later in the  month  the rise  in  prices was   checked.        OOTTOJj^    The moderate improvement in  output,  employment   and  exports which began in September,  was maintained during   October.  The  expansion of demand at the end  of  September,   however; was  due largely  to temporary factors and new buying   fell off slightly in October.    Exports of  yarns were  11,5   million lbs.  compared  with 10.7  million lbs.  in  September   1938 and 13.0  million  lbs.  in  October^  1937.

Thex^e   was  a slight  rise in prices of raw wool.        GOAL.   There was little  change  in October  in  the  coal   trade.   In both the inland and  export  markets conditions   compared unfavourably  with those which  prevailed a  year   ago.        CjiEIireALjj..   The  international  crisis in September   had  no apparent detrimental effect on the trade.  Business*   during October  Was better than in recent months  though   some of the activity may  have  been due  to orders which   accumulated during the  crisis.   There  is a  more  confident   feeling as  to  the  future.        POTTERY.^    In almost all  branches  of the industry   there v/as less  activity than a year  ago.
