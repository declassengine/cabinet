STATEMENT BY HIS MAJESTY1S     GOVERNMENT IN THE UNITED KINGDOM..LO      The Royal Commission^ pi^esided over by thelate Earl Peela published its report in July4 1957.and proposed a solution of the Palestine problem by means of a scheme -of partition under whichindependent Arab and Jewish States would be establishedwhile other areas would be retained under mandatoryadministration..  In their statement of policy following upon the publication of the report. His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the United Kingdom announced their general agreement with the arguments and conclusionsof the Royal Commission, and expressed the viewthat a scheme of partition on the general lines recommended by the Commission represented the best and most hopeful solution of the deadlocks2c      The proposal of the Commission was framedin the light of the Information available at thetime, and it was generally recognised that further detailed examination T/ould be necessary before itcould be decided whether such a solution would prove practicable.   This proposal was subsequentlydiscussed in Parliament and at meetings of thePermanent Mandates Commission and the Counciland Assembly of the League of Nationss when His
Majesty&apos;s Government received authority to explore thepractical application of the principle of partition.A despatch of S5rd December, 1957, from the Secretaryof State for the Colonies to the high Commissioner forPalestine, ,announced the intention of His majesty&apos;s government to undertake the further investigationsrequired for the drawing up of a more precise and detailed scheme.   It was pointed out that the finaldecision could not be taken in merely general terms and that the further enquiry would provide thenecessary material on which to judge, when the best possible partition scheme had been formulated, itsequity and practicability.    The despatch also definedthe functions and terms of reference of the technicalCommission who were appointed to visit Palestine forthe purpose of submitting in due course to HisMajesty&apos;s Government proposals for such a detailed scheme.5,   His Majesty&apos;s Government have now received thereport of the Palestine Partition Commission who have carried out their investigations with greatthoroughness and efficiency, and have ^collectedmaterial which will be very valuable in the furtherconsideration of policy.   Their report is nowpublished, together with a summary of their conclusions.It will be noted that the four members of the Commissionadvise unanimously against the adoption of the scheme/  Command 5654,
of partition outlined by the Royal Commission.In addition to the Royal Commissions scheme, two other schemes described as plans B and C are examined in the report.   One member prefers plan B.    two other members, including the Chairman, consider thatplan C is the best scheme of partition which, underthe terms of reference, can be devised.   A fourthmember, while agreeing that plan C is the best that can be devised under the terms of reference, regardsboth plans as impracticable.   The report points outthat under either plan, while the budget of theJewish State is likely to show a substantial surplus,the budgets of the Arab State (including Trans-Jordan)and of the Mandated Territories are likely to showsubstantial deficits.   The Commission rejects asimpracticable the Rcyal Commission1s recommendation for a direct subvention from the Jewish State to theArab State,   They think that on economic grounds a customs union between the States and the mandated territories is essential and they examine thepossibility of finding the solution for the financialand economic problems of partition by means of ascheme based upon such a union..   They consider thatany such scheme wou.ld be inconsistent with the grantof fiscal independence to the Arab and Jewish States..Their conclusion is that on a strict interpretation.of their terms of reference, they have no alternative but to report that they are unable to                   -3-
(5 2 recommend boundaries  for  the proposed areas which will afford a reasonable  prospect of the eventual establishment of self-supporting Arab and Jewish States o 4.     His Majesty&apos;s Government, after careful study of the Partition Commission&apos;s report, have reached the conclusion that this  further examination has shown that the political, administrative and financial difficulties involved in the proposal to create independent Arab and Jewish States insidePalestine are so great that this solution of thep rob 1 em i s imp rac t i c ab 1 e. 5.     His Majesty&apos;s Government will therefore- continue their responsibility for the government of the whole, of Palestine.   They are now faced with the problem of finding alternative means of meeting the needs of the difficult situation described by the Royal Commission which will be consistent with their obligations to the Arabs and the Jews.   HisMajesty&apos;s Government believe that it is possible to find these alternative means.    They have already given much thought to the problem in the light of the reports of the Royal Commission and of the partition Commission.   It is clear that the surest foundation for peace and progress inPalestine woula be an understanding between theArabs and the Jews,  and His Majesty&apos;s Government are prepared in the first instance to make a
determined effort to promote such an understanding.With this end in view, they propose immediately to invite representatives of the Palestinian Arabs andof neighbouring States on the one hand and of theJewish Agency on the other, to confer with them as soon as possible in London regarding future policy, including the question of immigration into palestine.  As regards the representation of the palestinian Arabs His Majesty&apos;s Government must reserve the right to refuse to receive thoseleaders whom they regard as responsible for the campaign of assassination and violence.6.     His Majesty&apos;s Government hope that these discussions in London may help to promote agreement as to future policy regarding Palestine.   they attach great importance, however, to a decisionbeing reached at an early date.  Therefore, if theLondon discussions should not produce agreementwithin a reasonable period of time, they will take their own decision in the light of their examinationof the problem and of the discussions in London,and announce the policy which they propose to pursue.7,     In considering and settling their policyHis Majesty&apos;s Government will keep constantly in mind the international  character of the Mandate withwhich they b.ave been entrusted and their obligations in that respect.
