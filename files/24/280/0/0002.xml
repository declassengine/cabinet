At their meeting on the 26th October,  1938,  the cabinet agreed (Reference Cabinet 50 (38) Conclusion 4):          (l) That a Cabinet Committee should be  appointed              comprising -               The Minister for Co-ordination of  Defence                                             (Chairman),               The Chancellor of the Exchequer,               The Home Secretary,               The First Lord of the Admiralty,               The Secretary of State for War,               The Secretary of State for Air,               The Minister of Labour,              to consider proposals for extending the scope              of the Defence Programmes and measures designed              to accelerate production:          (2) That the Committee should have power to invite              the attendance of Officials as required:          (3) That the Paper prepared by the Secretary of              State for Air (CP. 218 (38)) on the improve-              ment of this country&apos;s position in  the air,              should be referred to this Committee. 2,     The  proposals  which have  been  put forward by the Service  Departments  and by the Home  Office,  together with our  recommendations  thereon, are  set  out  as briefly as possible in this  Report.if  % 011 4x 1 m I J   $%  COPY :N0, a
SscortVessels.ADMIRALTY.2.   The recent crisis disclosed the fact that the number-of destroyers and escort vessels available is inadequate for all the duties, including  trade protection, escortof transports and convoys etc,, for which such vesselswould be required in war.   The Admiralty therefore propose to build a new type of escort vessel to meet this deficiency, which would cost about  390,000 each, i.e.,little more than half as much as a modern destroyer.They ask for immediate authority to lay down 10 of these vessels to be completed within 12 to IS months.Thereaftermthey would propose to lay down a further batch of 10.     Provision for the first batch of 10 escort vesselscan be found within the Admiralty financial &quot;ration&quot;, sothat the proposal for which immediate authority is askedis in effect merely a measure of acceleration.we recommend that the Admiralty should have authority forthe immediate laying down of the first batch of thevessels in question, subject to the usual arrangements for obtaining Treasury Sanction,Accordingly^Minesweepers  3.and Anti-SubmarineVessels.     There is at present a shortage of minesweepers and anti-submarine vessels, especially the former.   Trawlersrequisitioned on mobilisation would take time to fit out,and none could be expected to be ready in less than threeweeks.   It would take several months before many wouldbe working.     The Admiralty therefore ask for authority (a) to spend about  150,000 on the immediate purchase of 8-10commercial35 trawlers which are at present laid up;  and(b) to construct 12 small shallow draught minesweepers.     We were informed that this proposal also can be met out of the existing Admiralty financial &quot;ration&quot;, and we regard it as a desirable measure of acceleration.   Wetherefore recommend that the Admiralty should have      s . The precise number depends upon th.e actual         cost- of these vessels.a
NewMinelayer.Defenceof Ports.Dover andRosythHarbours.                                                       0                                                       *-&apos; authority to  obtain Treasury approval  in the ordinary-way                                                              I for the  immediate  purchase  of 8-10  commercial trawlers and for the  construction of 12  small  shallow draught minesweepers. I 4.   The-J. 93 8 New  Construction Programme:,  as originally                                                              I submitted by  the Admiralty,  included provision for four fast  H minelayers but the  number  was reduced to  three in the Programme as  finally authorised.     The Admiralty now propose that the  fourth minelayer      g should be restored to the Programme, and state that the cost can be met within the Admiralty ration.     The  course &quot;proposed appears to us to be a desirablemeasure  of acceleration, and we are further  informed that more favourable contract prices would be obtained if the    -course proposed is adopted.    We therefore recommend itsapproval, subject  to  the usual reference to the TreasuryInter-Services Committee.5.   The Admiralty are seriously concerned regarding thestate of  the defence  at certain Fleet bases and other portsboth at home and abroad.     We recommend that they should lay their proposals     -    &quot;before the Joint Oversea and Home Defence Committee,  witha view to the matter being brought before the Committee ofImperial Defence.6.   The Admiralty propose that the work of dredging Doverand Rosyth Harbours should be put in hand forthwith,  on thegrounds that these harbours, which are essential for the useof the Fleet in war,  are now silting up.    The cost,  which &apos;is estimated at  400,000,  would be spread over 2 to 3 years,and the Admiralty  state that the cost cannot be met from within the Admiralty  &quot;ration&quot;.     This work is of  great importance and we recommendthat the Admiralty should  he^e authority to put it in handforthwith.
Defensive-Arming, ofLarge  Linersand merchant ships.PassiveDefence.Oil FuelStorageandAmmunitionStorage,Cordite. 7.      The Admiralty regard it as important  that  approval should he given to the whole scheme for stiffening merchant ships, and that the execution of the  scheme should he so  accelerated that it can be completed by  the end of 1940.    This will involve additional  expenditure both in 1938  and the next two years, but the total cost of  the scheme will be substantially unaltered..        We think that this is a desirable measure  of acceleration,  and we recommend that approval should be obtained in the ordinary way from the  Treasury Inter- Services Committee. 8.      The Admiralty ask for the expenditure of an additional sum of approximately   1-g- million, over and above  provision  which can be met from the Admiralty &quot;ration&quot;,  on  the  completion  of the  passive defence of naval  establishments.    We consider that this  is a question involving considerable detail which should be  taken up direct with the Treasury.    In the  event of  a  difference of  opinion between the two Departments  the matter shouldbe  referred to  the Committee  of  Imperial  Defence. 9,      The Admiralty also  submitted extensive proposals foraccelerating the programmes  of construction  of under-ground storage  for oil  fuel  and  ammunition.   We felt thatit was  impossible  for  us  in  the  short&apos; time available toexamine  these proposals,  and  we  have therefore  suggestedthat they  should be  considered as early  as possible by theAdmiralty  and Treasury  in  consultation.10.-    The Admiralty are  entirely dependent at the presenttime on  the Royal  Naval Cordite  Factory  at Holton Heath.It is  important in their view  that an additional source ofsupply should be made available, further removed from thedanger area.   The Minister for  Co-ordination of defence is shortly laying proposals on this subject before theCommittee of Imperial Defence.
fleet air Arm.11.    The Admiralty inform us that there was an extremely serious deficiency during the emergency in aircraft for the Fleet Air Arm.   We have invited theAdmiralty and the Air Ministry to examine the matter inconsult ation.Fleet Air Arm  IS.Aerodrome atScana Flow.New SignalSchool.ArmourPlate.       The Admiralty inform us that it is essential foran aerodrome to be provided at Scapa Flow for the use ofthe Fleet Air Arm in war time,, and that the eost5 which isestimated at  1003000S could not be found out of theAdmiralty&apos;s &quot;ration&quot;.   As a small offset to subsequentexpenditure on maintenances we were advised that ScottishAirways might be prepared to make use of these facilities and pay for them.       We recommend that the provision of this aerodromeshould be approved in principle.  The details should betaken up in consultation between the Treasury and theAdmiralty in the ordinary way.13.    In view of the serious shortage of signal ratings.the Admiralty ask&apos;for the provision of a new signalschool.   The land on which the school is to be builthas already been purchased.   The cost of the signalschool  and experimental establishment is estimated at 6S5.000.       We recommend that the proposal should be approved in principle.   The details should be taken up inconsultation between the Treasury and the Admiralty inthe ordinary way.14,    The Admiralty ask for authority to place an orderin Czechoslovakia for 29200 tons of armour plate.Admiralty orders for armour plate have already beenplaced in that country to the amount of some 15?000tons.
1 2.4. i-J      We recommend the placing of the additionalorder, subject to approval being obtained in theordinary way from the Treasury Inter-services committee..15.   The Admiralty inform us that they are suffer-ing from a serious shortage of skilled ratings, whichmay be expected to continue until 1942, when it isexpected that the Admiralty would obtain thebenefit of the largely increased entries of apprenticeswhich were made as soon as the Naval expansionbegan.      This is a problem common to all three defence services, and we have suggested to them that theyshould consider the matter conjointly in consultationwith the Ministry of Labour.WAR OFFICE.16.   The War Office have asked us for authorityto increase the provision of anti-aircraft guns(3,7&quot; and 4.5&quot;) to the number specified in the&quot;Ideal Scheme&quot; for the Air Defence of Great Britain,namely up to a total of 1,264 guns.      We recommend:-        (i)  That the number of anti-aircraft               equipments at present authorised               should be  increased to the number               specified  in the &quot;Ideal Scheme&quot; for               the Air Defence of Great Britain, and               those required for ports abroad.        (ii) That the War Office should be authorised               to create  the capacity required for               carrying out the increased programme,               and to place immediate orders for               additional equipments in so far as such               orders were essential to the development               of new capacity to reach the stage of
Light Anti-AircraftEquipments.Searchlights.Predictors ,Heightf inders ,Fuze. Setterssnd Mechanical?uzes.          production and delivery.  Treasury          approval for the proposals should he          obtained in the ordinary way.  It is  *       understood that the War Office consider          that it will be necessary to place orders          for approximately 300 new A.A. equipments          (3.7-inch and 4.5-inch) in order to bring          into being the additional capacity required.17.    The War Office ask that a further 1,000 lightanti-aircraft equipments should be authorised over anaabove the figure of 1,200 specified in the &quot;IdealScheme&quot;.       At our request the War Office have investigatedthe possibility of obtaining from any source, british or foreign, deliveries of 1,000 light anti-aircraftequipments of any type.  Their inquiries up to thepresent time indicate that it will probably bepossible to purchase about 100 additional guns from foreign sources.  The matter is still under examination.18.    The far Office have asked for authority toplace an order to bring the number of searchlights upto that contemplated under the &quot;Ideal Scheme&quot;, namely,4,704 lights.       The Admiralty have also asked that provision should be made for additional searchlights at portsabroad.       We recommend that the War Office should beauthorised to place orders for such additional search-lights as are required up to a. total of 600 (includingapproximately 50 required at ports abroad) on theunderstanding that before such orders are placed de-tailed arrangements are made with the,Treasury.19.    The War Office have informed us of the position regarding the placing of orders for Predictors,Heightfinders, Fuze Setters and Mechanical Fuzes.       As regards predictors-we understand that theWar Office will get into touch with the Treasury if theneed arises for increased financial provision for the
KeepingFirms in production.Payment of)orapensationlin Connectionnth Priori-ties. purpose of placing orders abroad.        As regards heightfinders,  fuze setters and mechanical fuzes,  we recommend that orders should,  if necessary, be placed abroad,  subject to Treasury approval being obtained in the ordinary way. SO.     We have been informed by the War Office that the  orders placed with a number of firms which have been converted into munition firms and have trained men specially for munition work,  will be completed within the  nest few months.   We considered a proposal made by the  War Office that steps should be taken to maintain these firms in production.   The firms concerned are mainly engaged in the production of shell.   The cost of this measure is estimated at   3;?- millions.        We recommend that authority should be given  for the  placing of the additional orders necessary to keep these firms in production until  31st March,  1940, subject to approval being obtained in the ordinary way from the Treasury Inter-Services committee.21.     It was represented to  us  that it was  often impossible for the Service Departments to secure priority for munitions production over private orders;   and it was suggsted that,  in the  absence of any  compulsory powers,  a method of securing  the necessary priority might in certain cases be the payment of compensation to firms who would otherwise  have to meet penalties  if they were to accord priority  to  munitions production. It is,  of course,  Imperative  that stich compensation should be restricted to the amount of loss which a  firm would Incur,  and that  a door  should not be opened to
                 profiteering,,   Each case would have to he considered                 otx its merits, with reference to the measure of the                 urgency and to the extent of the compensation                 involved under the -penalty clause.   Subject to these                 general observations, we recommend that the Treasury                 should give favourable consideration to any proposals                 for compensation to firms which the Service Departments                 may think it right to put forward to them.Role of          22.    In addition to the above proposals, thethe Army.                 Secretary of State for War put forward a Me.morand.um                 entitled &quot; The Role of the Army in the light of                 the Csechoslovakian Crisis&quot;.   This paper raised                 very wide Issues, which in our opinion were                 appropriate for consideration by the Committee of                 Imperial Defence rather than by our Committee.   They                 did not appear to fall within our terms of                 reference, which were &quot;to consider proposals for                 extending the scope of the Defence Programmes and                 measures designed to accelerate production&quot;.   We                 have therefore suggested to:, the Secretary of State for                 War that he should submit the proposals contained.                 in his Paper to the Committee of Imperial Defence.-9-
AIR MINISTRY.2So    In accordance with (2) of the Cabinet Conclusionset out in paragraph 1 above, we have examined theMemorandum by the Secretary, of State for Air entitled&quot;Relative Air Strengths and Proposals for the Improvementof this Country&apos;s Position&quot; (CP. 218 (38)).       Our discussion of the proposals contained in thisMemorandum was adjourned pending conversations betweenthe Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary of                      -State for Air.  We are not therefore in a position tosubmit recommendations-on this matter.       The views of the Chancellor of the Exchequer onthe proposals of the Secretary of State for Air are set out in the Memorandum which is attached as theAppendix to this Report              HOME OFFICE.ir Raid       24.    We have had under consideration certain Air Raidrecautions.

               APPENDIX.      AIR MINISTRY. PROGRAMME. CP. 818(38).    Minute by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.1.       It has not been possible in the time at mydisposal to do more than frame a very general estimateof the finance involved in the Air Ministry programme,but I gather that if that scheme is approved withoutreservation the Air Ministry will need to expend in thefive years to April 1942 a sum which exceeds by nearly 350 millions the amount which could be allotted to it out of the total five years&apos; expenditure of  1,650millions for all Defence Services (including Civil Defence)which was put forward as recently as 8th February lastby the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence in his report to the Cabinet on Defence Expenditure in future years (CP. 24 (38)),2.       The essential requirements of other servicesalso, including A.R.P., have involved and are continuing to involve material additions to that aggregate figure.Moreover the great additions to our burden now being asked for will have to be met, not over a period of fiveyears, but rather within the three years 1939/40,1940/41, and 1941/42.3..       Meanwhile the yield  of revenue is sagging withthe declining activity of the country as a whole.4..-      The Air Ministry&apos;s programme is therefore socostly as to raise serious  doubt whether it can be financed beyond 1939/40 without the gravest danger to thecountry&apos;s stability.   The damage which I apprehend is
not  of  the  sort  which can he got over by calling for&quot;sacrifices&quot;;   it  would consist in such a weakening ofour  economic and financial strength as no increase oftaxation could remedy.5.        Excessive borrowing entails the risks of higher  costs,  higher wages and most certainly higherinterest rates so  that  the burden on the country even iftolerable at first becomes progressively worse.Moreover, it means substantially increased imports andsubstantially  reduced exports.   Our balance of payments -already  a serious  problem - will become more and more serious.  .In the end our monetary reserves (which havealready  been heavily depleted since the crisis by thewithdrawal  of  foreign capital from this country) mightbe still more  rapidly exhausted and we should have lost the  means of carrying on a long struggle altogether.6.        I  do  not  for a moment  claim that purely financial considerations  can  have  priority over urgent and definite needs for material  defence.   The two things have to be considered together.   The worst of all results would be to reach aposition hereafter in  which defence plans should be openly seen tohave  been frustrated by the financial and economic situation.7.        I  think,  therefore,  that a sharp distinction should be drawn  between the total figures of theSecretary of State&apos;s fighter programme and the totalfigures  of  the Secretary of State.&apos;s bomber programme.The  Cabinet  should be invited as a decision of policy toauthorise an intensive  concentration  on the production of fighters up  to the  full  figures proposed with particular regard
to getting the maximum production possible within 1959.Orders for 1,850 fighters as proposed in paragraph 32of the Secretary of State&apos;s paper should be approved.8.     So far as the bombers are concerned I suggestthat the Cabinet should give general approval to the placing of orders sufficient to avoid substantialdismissals in the factories concerned and to providea normal complement of work in any national factorydesigned for this work but at the moment under-employed.9.     As I understand the matter it is often foundnecessary, in order to effect this object, to place orders long in advance of the time for payment and delivery.   Accordingly a point may be reached - andpossibly fairly quickly - at which the placing of orders on this basis may be found to be leading to financial commitments maturing, it may be, as long as eighteen&apos;months or two years ahead, which are prima facie beyondthe country&apos;s resources to meet.   I suggest, therefore,that suitable arrangements should be made for associatingthe Treasury with the question of the flow of orders sothat they may be apprised of the position as it develops.Y/hen the difficulty which I have just mentioned arises ina concrete form it would be necessary for the Cabinet to review the position again.10.    Could not the question of the 2,400 miscellaneousaircraft be looked at in more detail in the light of thefinancial considerations set out above?   For instance,it is not clear to me why proportional increases arerequired in Army co-operation machines &quot;and in the fleet air Arm for this would seem to depend on whether theArmy or the Fleet are being extensively enlarged in viewof the German air menace.
11*     All these are difficult  and perplexing matters,.I propose to continue my discussions upon  them with  theSecretary of State in the  interval &quot;before  they com6ibefore the Cabinet0                         (Intd.) J.S.
