(Signed)      H. L. ISMAY.    Richmond Terrace, S. W. 1,        November 5,  1938.                              ENCLOSURE.            Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.    THE Committee of Imperial Defence at its 330th Meeting* on the 21st July,1938, recorded the following  conclusion :    &quot;(c) To invite the Board of Trade to re-examine and report on the question           of the extension to arms export of the Export Credits plan to which           reference was made in the letter dated the 27th April, 1938,t from           the  Secretary  of  State for  Foreign Affairs  to the  Minister for           Co-ordination of Defence.&quot;    Apart from the short period between 1920 and 1921, the powers of the export credits Guarantee Department of the Board of Trade have always been limitedto furnishing guarantees for exports of goods other than munitions of war.  Thepossibility of removing this restriction has been considered from time to time, butthe conclusion hitherto has always been  that this should  not be done.    2.  The principal  arguments for  extending the system of export creditguarantees to  exports  of  armaments are military and  political the necessitythat we should do all that we can to maintain and even expand our connectionsabroad, *both in order to provide a standby for our armament firms when our owndemands are less, and to preserve that  political influence with the Governmentsconcerned which tends to attach to the country which supplies their main defence requirements.  When we cannot supply arms to countries which are willing to buy them here, our prestige and  influence suffer, and if, as often happens, theorders go in consequence to Germany, Germany&apos;s prestige and political influence        :.V.&apos;A: * Minute 1 (c).&apos;          f See Enclosure 2 to CP. 117 (38).        P^iM.       [18171]
  are correspondingly increased.   This not merely damages us in the present, but  is likely to reduce the opportunities of United Kingdom firms for obtaining orders  in the future when they may be in urgent need of them.      3.  That  the  importance of these considerations is now widely recognised  was shown by the favourable reception accorded by Parliament to the Anglo-  Turkish (Armament Guarantees) Act, 1938, and I am satisfied that, if the export  credits scheme is to be extended to armaments, the present is as good a time as  is likely to occur for securing the necessary legislation.      4.  On commercial grounds, a  step which would result in increasing our  export trade is, prima facie, desirable; and it is somewhat illogical that at present  we  should in the national interest permit the export of arms, but refuse to them  the facilities which we extend  to all other exports.   It may be said that, at the  present time, our own  requirements would  prevent  United  Kingdom  manu-  facturers of munitions from taking advantage of export guarantees if they  were  available,  and for certain  types of munitions this is certainly true.  But there  are undoubtedly important classes of munitions, such  as  ships, marine engines,  ammunition motor lorries, tents, &amp;c, for which capacity is available and foreign  orders could readily be executed.  The term &quot; munitions of war &quot; in the existing  Export Guarantees Act,  1937,  covers a wide field,  and precludes the giving of  guarantees in respect of almost any goods, however harmless they may appear  to be,  if they are known to be intended for the armed forces of a foreign country.      5.  The main objection to providing export credit facilities for armaments  in the past has  been the inconsistency of any such action with our policy of  disarmament.  Obviously, this objection has now disappeared.  There are  still,  however,  other political objections.  If the scheme is to be  effective it will be  necessary that the Government should be able, in the interests of foreign policy,  both to secure the acceptance of particular transactions which on business grounds  alone  might be turned down, and to veto others which on business grounds might  be acceptable.  The exercise of  discrimination of this sort on political grounds  might well create  difficulties with the foreign  Governments,  whose applications  were  refused,  and even where guarantees were given our  action  might cause  offence to third countries.      6.  Credits  or credit guarantees for armaments to be useful from the point  of view of foreign policy would need to be  of substantial size  and to be offered  without too strict a regard for financial prudence.  The countries which it would  be desired to help  would often be of  doubtful standing, and the risks to be taken  of quite a different character from those accepted by the Export Credits Guarantee  Department in its ordinary business.  There would be involved not so much an  extension  of  the present export credit guarantees scheme,  which  is run on a  business basis and is self-supporting, as the  provision of credits  for  foreign  countries on security which would often be very doubtful;  the Government would  therefore have to be prepared to face considerable losses.  In these circumstances,  it is  not, in my opinion,  feasible to graft on to the existing export credits  guarantee system a large-scale arrangement for providing credits for munitions.  To  do so  would destroy the commercial basis on which  that  Department  now  operates,  and would place  its Advisory Committee of business  men in  an  impossible position by throwing upon them the consideration of political questions  which would be inseparable from applications for credits for munitions on a large  scale. It would  be necessary to create a separate department or branch, working&apos;  on  different lines from the existing  Export Credits Guarantee Department.      7.  The economic objections to risking our own money and encouraging other  countries  to waste theirs on armaments which they cannot afford are as strong  now as they have  ever been.  If a  country, would buy armaments anyhow,  it ist. ho  doubt  better  that they should be bought here than elsewhere. &apos;  But if the  provision of credit facilities by us encourages a country to buy armaments which  it would not otherwise import,  the result from the economic point of view can  only be harmful to that country and, in the long run,  to our own trade with it.  For, even if it be true that whatever sacrifices a country has  to make in other  directions, it will  always find money to pay for armaments,  nevertheless it will  be able to do so in the long run only by cutting down its purchases of other goods  from  us, and the armament credit will be repaid to some extent at the expense of  our ordinary export trade.
     8.   There appear to be two alternative courses open, if it is decided that somedeparture from our previous policy is necessary.   One would be to authorise theBoard of Trade, with the consent of the Treasury (as in the Export GuaranteesAct,  1937), to give credits or guarantees solely in respect of munitions of warup to a maximum of &amp;w millions, and to set up  the necessary administrative machinery for this purpose.  The other would be to proceed- as we have donein the past in regard te ordinary export credit guarantees, but to announce  our readiness in appropriate cases  to consider ad hoc legislation  for the purposeof giving arms credits to particular countries, as was done in the case of Turkey.On the economic side, the disadvantages of the first course seem to me to outweighits advantages.  The  political and military advantages which might follow fromits adoption are hard to assess, and their value seems somewhat dubious when set against  the virtual&apos; certainty that the scheme would make considerable losses.I  have accordingly reached  the conclusion that we should not be justified in creating a general scheme for granting credit or credit guarantees for armamentson the scale which would be necessary if they were to be useful as an instrument offoreign policy, and that the most economical way of using any money which wecan spare for  this purpose would be by means of ad hoc legislation on the lines ofthe Anglo-Turkish (Armaments  Credit) Act.     9.   If this  conclusion  is accepted, there remains one other step which couldbe  taken at once.  As  mentioned above, the  interpretation which I have been advised  must be put on the words &apos;&apos; munitions of war &apos;&apos;  in the existing lawprohibits the Export  Credits Guarantee Department from assisting transactions in a wide range of goods which, though technically munitions  of war, are  not generally considered  to be armaments.  This interpretation often results  indecisions which are unintelligible to  exporters and  to the  foreign Governmentsconcerned, who  are  naturally   irritated  by  rulings which appear to  theminexplicable&apos;.  It  has  also produced a number  of  strange  anomalies.   Thepossibility of  substituting some  more  limited expression was examined when  theExport Guarantees Act, 1937, was in preparation,  and agreement was reachedamong the departments concerned that the  goods  to be excluded from the export guarantees scheme should be defined as &quot;weapons of war or other goods which,.in the opinion of the Board of Trade, are constructed or intended for destructiveuse in war.&quot;  At that time, however,  the Cabinet decided against any alteration in order to avoid introducing a point which might have given rise to controversyinto a Bill which had  to be passed urgently.  I think  the time has now come when this change should be  made and  that no difficulty need be expected in Parliamentif the announcement is  made at the same time that  we are prepared in suitable cases to introduce legislation for giving credits to particular countries for  arms.A more  restricted definition of the  prohibited classes of goods, which  wouldenable the Department to extend its ordinary business  to cover exports,  forexample, of engines for warships, tents, motor lorries and uniforms, could beadopted  without giving rise to the difficulties which would  be involved&apos; by a fullsystem of guarantees for armaments.  The suggested change would tend to assistour foreign trade  and the political effect in the countries which buy from us, ifnot great, would be, at any rate,  favourable.    10.  It will be necessary to introduce a Bill early in the new  session to raisethe limit on the  volume  of business which the Export Credits Guarantee Depart-ment  can undertake.  This will  afford an opportunity of making any announce-ment which seems desirable on the larger question of  guarantees for munitions ingeneral and of  securing the amendment of the Export Guarantees Act,  1937,suggested in the last paragraph.    11.  My recommendations may, therefore, be  summarised as follows :     (1)  ^hat the Government should not at present set up any general scheme for          providing credits or guarantees  in respect of exports of munitions to          foreign countries;    (2)  that on the second reading of the forthcoming Export  Guarantees  Bill a          statement should be made in Parliament indicating that the Govern-          ment are fully alive  to the importance of facilitating the supply of          armaments by United Kingdom manufacturers to friendly countries,          and that they will be ready to consider in appropriate cases the passing
      of special measures to enable assistance to be given by means of credits      or otherwise to particular countries, as was done in the case of Turkey;(3) that the Export Guarantees Act, 1937, should be amended by the new Bill      so as to enable the Board of Trade to give guarantees in connection      with the export of goods which are not &quot; weapons of  war or other      goods which, in the opinion of the  Board of Trade, are constructed or      interiaed for destructive use in war.&quot;                                                         O.

(C.I.D. Paper No. 1480-B.)     (Previous reference :  C.I.D. Minutes of the 330th Meeting, Minute 1.)    THE COMMITTEE had under consideration a Memorandum by the Presi-dent of the Board of  Trade on the question of extending the system of  exportcredit guarantees to cover  the export of armaments (C.I.D. Paper No.  1480-B).    MR. STANLEY  said that  the  Board  of Trade  had  been asked by  theCommittee of  Imperial Defence  to examine and report on  this question.  his memorandum  summarized  arguments on  this  question and indicated the  con-clusions he had reached.   It would be remembered that this question had beendiscussed on many occasions and in 1937,  when the Export Guarantees Act hadbeen introduced,  the  Cabinet had been  averse  to  any extension  of credits to  include  armaments.    We  should,  however,  not be  deterred  by  thatdecision, as he believed  that all the arguments which had  then  influencedthe  Cabinet  no  longer   applied.    The   political   implications  of  suchan  extension  were  now   different  and,   having regard  to  the  favourable reception  accorded by Parliament to  the  Anglo-Turkish (Armaments)  CreditsAct, 1938, he was satisfied that,  if it was  decided to extend the Export credits scheme to armaments, the present was a favourable time from the Parliamentarypoint of view.    Certain other considerations were, however,  involved.  The existing export credits Guarantee Scheme was  self-supporting  and was run on a commercial basis, with an Advisory Committee of business men who were jealous of their commercial reputations.  In his view it would be impossible to extend the scopeof the  Scheme by the inclusion of provision for credits for munitions, which, inmost cases, would not be economic propositions.  Nor did he think that an exten-sion of the existing scheme, to cover armaments, if confined to transactions whichcould be justified commercially, would result in an increased export of armaments..He understood that the cases the Foreign Office had in mind were countries whichcould not afford to pay for armaments and,  in effect, the Foreign Office desiredto have facilities  for supplying them with presents of  arms for the purposes offoreign policy. He did not consider that  any  extension of the  existing Act forthis purpose^was practicable.    From paragraph 8 of  his Memorandum it would be seen that there were two-alternative courses.   The first  would be to authorise the Board of Trade, withthe consent of the Treasury, to  give credits or guarantees  solely in respect ofmunitions of war up to a  maximum of  X millions and to set up the necessary administrative machinery for this purpose.  This would leave the existing export credits Guarantee  Scheme on a  commercial  basis,  and  would  put  the riskybusiness of supplying armaments to countries who could probably not pay forthem on a different footing.  In his view there would be international difficulties       [18227-6]                                                   B
in presenting such  a Scheme and  political  difficulties  if  the  setting .up of administrative machinery  on the lines  proposed were  to  be  announced.  Hethought it would be very difficult to differentiate between foreign countries, someof whom would  get a dip in the  bag and others who were not considered fit to share.    The second alternative would be to use any money which could be spared forthis purpose by means of ad hoc legislation on the  lines of the Anglo-Turkish(Armaments) Credits Act.  He could not imagine that any foreign countries couldbe attracted by a policy which only involved small measures of assistance, and heimagined that the Foreign  Secretary would wish to do something for the foreigncountries concerned on the scale of the assistance which had been given to Turkey.    By ad hoc legislation we should be able to get over any political difficulties,as the House of Commons would be in a position to judge whether any particularproject was  worthy  or  not.  Whereas,  if  it was proposed to legislate for all foreign countries at  the same time  irrespective of what  was  involved, suchapproval might not be forthcoming.  Further, ad hoc legislation would relieve theGovernment  of the necessity of discriminating between foreign  countries.  Inaddition, there would be many cases where a mere extension of arms credits would  not be a  sufficient help, and particular foreign  countries  would requireassistance on a much wider scale.    His conclusion was that ad hoc legislation covering  the whole agreement withany particular foreign country was preferable  to setting up general machinery,which might not give adequate help and itself might require ad  hoc legislation to deal with particular cases.    His recommendations were summarized in paragraph 11.    It would be seen that if his proposal was approved, it would be necessary toamend the Export Guarantees Act, 1937,  by a new Bill, so as to enable the  Boardof. Trade to give guarantees in connection with the export of goods which are not&quot; weapons of war or other goods, which, in the opinion of the  Board of Trade,are constructed or intended for destructive use in war.&quot;  Further, during thepassage of the Bill in the House of Commons, it would be necessary to make astatement in  Parliament  that the  Government were fully alive to the importanceof facilitating the supply of armaments by United  Kingdom manufacturers tofriendly countries, and that they would be ready to consider, in appropriate cases,the passing of special measures to enable assistance to  be given by means of creditsor otherwise  to particular countries as was done in the case of Turkey.    LORD HALIFAX said that the question of extending to arms export theExport Credits Plan had been raised on the initiative of the Foreign Office, andhe was grateful to the  President of  the Board of Trade for his very helpfuldocument.    MR. STANLEY  interjected  that the Memorandum had been  prepared bythe Department of Overseas Trade.    Continuing, LORD  HALIFAX said that whilst there were certain  points in the Memorandum  from which he must dissent, he  agreed that in the  changed circumstances of to-day, there  would be no political objection to an extension to armaments of the  Export Credits Guarantee Scheme.  The question was howshould this be done.   Apart from the demands for armaments from the Dominionswe were faced with large demands for armaments from many countries which wewere anxious to help, and. to meet  this  situation the Board of Trade  had putforward their proposals.  He was, however, not in favour of proceeding by themethod of  ad hoc legislation on the lines of  the Anglo-Turkish (Armaments)Credits Act.   Whilst he could  not appreciate, as Mr. Stanley could, the feelingint. the House of Commons on the question of a general power or an  ad hoc method,in the Foreign Office view, the method of ad  hoc legislation which dotted the.  i&apos;s &quot; and crossed the &quot;  t:s &quot; would involve us in great difficulties, since  it would necessitate more public discussion of discrimination between foreign countriesthan was considered desirable.  The Foreign Office would therefore prefer  thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government should have  a general power, to be exercised  in thelight  of  their  own  judgment  in  particular cases.   Frankly, the  ForeignOffice would wish to remove the ban on munitions  under  the Export credits guarantee Scheme, whether the transactions involved  were economically soundor not.   The President  had said that such action would cut  right across the
functions of the Export Credits Guarantee Department and place its Advisory-Committee of business men in an impossible position.  In that respect he himselfcould not see any insuperable difficulty in setting up a machinery which wouldcomprise an Advisory Committee to advise on the business aspect of a proposal,and a deciding authority  to receive political advice, which  would have  to be weighed against the  advice given  on the business side.   Therefore, whilst he agreed with the President that a mere extension of power to the Export credits guarantee Department  to cover armaments would be  useless, he did not feel theplan he had put forward was so evidently impossible.    MR. STANLEY asked what would happen if, in  order to  influence a certaincountry,  it was considered more suitable  to give that country  an uneconomiccredit for commercial articles and not for  arms.  What would the business menbe expected to do.  Would they be expected to  override such a  proposal \  Ifsuch a function was instituted the commercial basis  of the present department would break down and it would be better to abandon  it, or it might be necessaryto set up a Government Department to give presents  to certain Powers withoutreceiving any advice as to the commercial aspect of the  transaction.    LORD HALIFAX said he had hardly hoped that the President would be inagreement with his first suggestion.  He  now put forward a second  suggestion which was  that, as  the President suggested,  the  Export  Credits  guarantee department should continue  to confine  its operations to transactions whichwere sound  commercially, its scope being,  however, extended  to cover activitiesover all fields of trade, including armaments.   There should also be set up aparallel organization with financial backing  to deal with transactions whichwere  politically desirable but  were unsound  commercially,  whether   suchtransactions concerned  munitions  or other goods.  The  Foreign Office were ofopinion, that if the Treasury were prepared to consider such a scheme,  it wouldbe suitable.    SIR SAMUEL HOARE said that the questions at  issue appeared  to bematters for Cabinet  decision.   He thought,  however, that  the  Committee ofImperial Defence  should agree as to the necessity for  widening the  scope ofthe Export  Credits Guarantee Scheme, so as to remove the  ban on  munitions..    LORD HALIFAX  said that it was vital to have powers to deal with proposals,,which were not commercially  sound, to  supply munitions  to certain  foreigncountries.  On that assumption, and if it was also vital to maintain the principleof  commercial soundness  of the  existing Export Credits Guarantee Scheme,.then we should be driven  to set up the two organizations.     In discussion Lord Halifax said the  technical aspects of the problems ofeconomic assistance to foreign countries were difficult to handle.   The proposals.he had suggested to-day were on all fours with those he had made in a Papersubmitted to the Cabinet*  on Central  and South-Eastern Europe  for setting up an  organization parallel to the  Export  Credits  Guarantee Department fordealing with credits on  a non-commercial basis with political objects in view. Itwas necessary  to  make a clear  distinction  between  proposals which  werecommercially sound and commercially  unsound, and to set  up special machinery to deal with the latter,  otherwise many countries would not be influenced.    MR. STANLEY  agreed  that, if unsound commercial  proposals  were dealtwith, they must be separated from sound commercial proposals and dealt with as.they arose.  We must,  however, concentrate on the big proposals.  It would bevery difficult to explain to the House of Commons that we  were setting up amachinery on the lines of the Export Credits Guarantee Department to deal withunsound commercial propositions.   The international aspect of the problem wastherefore not the only one.  It would be difficult for a Department to function,when all the world knew that requests could not be turned  down on economic:grounds.  We should be overwhelmed with proposals.  It would also be invidiousto say we could supply  one country but not another, as we  disliked their foreignpolicy.    LORD HALIFAX said that we were not in a position to confine assistanceto countries who were commercially sound.  As soon  as we had given assistance[18227-6]CP. 257 (38).
  to Turkey, we had been faced with demands for assistance from many other  countries.  He thought that the difficulties of explaining his proposal to the  House of Commons were exaggerated.      MR.  STANLEY pointed out that any grants given would be bound to be  shown in th&amp; estimates, and could therefore be debated in&apos; Parliament.      SIR SAMUEL HOARE said that the difficulty arose from the steps taken  by Germany to build up a large armament trade all over the world.  He did not  take the view  that  small orders from particular countries did not matter.   For  example, if a country was  given one  of  a new  type  of  aircraft, it would be  dependent on  the source  of supply for all spare parts, &amp;o, and by this method  Germany was digging herself  in  in many countries.   If it was necessary to  introduce ad hoc legislation for every proposal, we should only touch the fringe  of the problem.  Unless we were prepared to accept  the position  of general  domination, it would be necessary to get power  to extend credits to all small  orders.      MR.  HORE-BELISHA shared Sir Samuel Hoare&apos;s view.   He  considered  that every effort should be made to press our strategic influence in  the world and  to strengthen  the armament industry of this country.   The latter could not be  done  unless the armament industry was  given  the same advantages  as other  industries of the country.      MR.  STANLEY said that  the  Committee should be under no doubt as to  what would happen to the existing machinery which was run on a business basis  and was self-supporting, if it were extended as suggested by the Foreign Secretary.  The whole thing would become commercially unsound.      MR.  HUDSON said that  the extension of the  present Export  Credits  Guarantee Scheme to include munitions involved matters of high principle.  The  existing Scheme was responsible for a large proportion of our export  trade on  credit terms and it would not be worth while running  the risk of undermining  the commercial basis  and reputation of that organisation in order to  obtain  small orders for munitions.  It would not be possible  to ask business men to  assess the risk of accepting armament orders,  and there would always be a  tendency, for  political reasons, to tip the balance in  favour of an order  for  munitions which might be commercially unsound.      SIR  THOMAS INSKIP said the Foreign Secretary&apos;s proposal was  that  there  should be a  general power to grant credits in respect of munitions rather  than that such proposals  should be dealt with by ad hoc legislation as suggested  by the President of the Board of Trade.      LORD HALIFAX agreed and pointed out that he had proposed two separate  organisations to which, however, Mr. Stanley had objected.  He did  not  under-  stand why commercial  men should find difficulty in deciding whether a country  was sound or not, irrespective of whether the order  was for armaments or other  goods.      SIR JOHN SIMON pointed out that the sales in question were not to foreign  Governments,  and  it was a  matter of the soundness of the purchaser.      MR.  STANLEY thought that the  Secretary of State for War&apos;s  proposal  complicated the issue.   He did not believe that the  extension  of credits  for  armaments alone would do much good, and thought that it would be necessary  to give a subsidy to countries which we desired to influence.      MR. BRUCE, in reply to Sir Thomas Inskip, said that whilst the Dominions  had a big interest  in  the question of the  supply of armaments, he had some4  diffidence in intruding  in the discussion.  The matter was a domestic one for the  United Kingdom, but indirectly the Dominions were deeply concerned.   He felt  strongly that  the extension of  Germany&apos;s  armament drive would affect Great  Britain detrimentally and, in consequence, the Dominions.  It was necessary to  think deep in terms of what we were going to do.  It was not merely an extension  of the Export Credit Guarantees Act to munitions; the question went  deeper  than that, and turned on the possibility of giving countries extended opportunities  of trading with the United Kingdom.  He referred to the economic system of  Germany, based on  barter agreements with numerous countries, a  system which,
in his opinion, would eventually break down.  Meanwhile, until that happened,we had to retain the goodwill of the countries concerned.  He felt that ad hoclegislation in each  particular case would  increase the  difficulties.  He  askedwhether  there  was anything  in  the suggestion that the  Export  credits guarantee Department (an  admirable Department  to  which tribute  shouldbe paid) should extend its scope without its  task being  defined too &quot;specifically.&quot;Would it be possible  to make  a grant  to  that Department  and to  avoidtoo  much discussion in  Parliament  on every  item  for which the grant isnsed ?  It might be possible for the Department to continue its normal commercialtransactions  and put other transactions through by means of  the grant whichhe had proposed.   Whilst,  of  course, this was not  strictly a matter  for theDominions, they were closely affected  by the whole issue.     SIR  THOMAS INSKIP. suggested that, as the scheme  put forward by theForeign Secretary differed from that set out in paragraph 8 of  the Memorandumby the President of the Board of Trade, the Foreign Secretary and the president should  formulate and  submit to the   Cabinet their  proposals as to any new organisation  required.  It was  impossible to reach a  decision  until the natureof the proposal had  been more precisely defined.     ME. STANLEY said that sooner  or later a decision would be  required onthe principles involved, not  only on the detailed organisation.  He  would liketo hear the views of the Chancellor of the Exchequer on the  question.   In his view, ad hoc  legislation would be a check on what might  otherwise be unlimitedgraft.     SIR  JOHN SIMON agreed  with Sir Thomas  Inskip&apos;s  suggestion  that -details should be worked  out in more  detail for submission  to  the Cabinet and suggested that the Treasury should co-operate in the  discussions.  In his view there were two difficulties which were  not matters for discussion with the Com-mittee of  Imperial Defence.  -   In the first place, it was difficult to envisage legislation in regard to a generalguarantee. Under our system of Government, it was not possible to give guaran-tees  or to make grants  except by way of specific legislation or of some  generalformula, which  the  House of Commons would accept.  These  difficulties would show themselves when we started to work out the present suggestion.  Incident-ally  he remarked that the Export Credits Guarantee Department was acceptable to Parliament because  it paid  for itself  and  showed  profits.  The  foreign secretary appeared to want something  which would not be a commercial propo-sition, which would  mean that, if the  country concerned  could  not pay the bill,we should, within certain limits,  pay.  He would  like to see  this proposal setout in writing.  Another point that had emerged during the  discussion was thatan executive  department should be empowered to supply  foreign countries witharms at a certain cost. The difficulties of selling even old  armaments at less thanthe current rate were well known.     SIR  SAMUEL HOARE said the chief arguments  in  this question werepolitical.   He would, however, like to  see a view recorded by the Committee ofImperial Defence that we should make every effort to keep  all the markets wecould.  The majority of  the points which had emerged in to-day&apos;s discussion were really matters for the Cabinet.     LORD STANHOPE  emphasized the value of attaching foreign countries to ourselves by the  sale of armaments.     After further discussion LORD HALIFAX said he agreed with Sir ThomasInskip&apos;s suggestion that the Departments concerned (including Treasury) should draft a scheme, as far as possible in an agreed form.   He hoped that this wouldbe submitted to the  Cabinet with a statement that the Committee of ImperialDefence had  agreed that  it was necessary that our trade with certain  foreigncountries, whether  in  munitions  or  in other  matters, should  be extendedeven although this  might  involve transactions  which were not commerciallyjustifiable. He suggested that the matter should be further dealt with by an Inter-departmental  Committee,  the Chairman of  which might  be Sir Warren Fisher.It must, however, be made clear that we were living  in  a new world and must-consider new conditions.
    MR.  STANLEY agreed.  He pointed  out,&quot; however, that in bringing this.matter to the Committee of Imperial Defence we  were not facing the major problem.    The extension of the Export Credits Guarantee Scheme to munitions did nottouch the fringe of the problem.  There were many cases inwhieh the need was greater than the extension of credits, and he suggested that the Interdepart-mental Committee should consider the matter on  the wider basis and report  tothe Cabinet.    SIR THOMAS INSKIP summarized the discussion, and said that the viewof the Committee appeared to be that Lord Halifax&apos;s proposals should be further examined interdepartmentally, and that the report from this interdepartmentalbody to the Cabinet should be prefaced with  a statement that the Committee  ofImperial Defence  considered that, in the interests of Imperial defence,  it was important to increase the export of armaments to foreign countries.  He asked the Ministers concerned to decide between themselves whether the report shouldbe prepared by Ministers or by Officials.                               CONCLUSIONS.    THE  COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE  agreed :     (a) That, in the interests of Imperial Defence, it was important to increase          the export of armaments to foreign countries.    (b) That the Treasury,  the  Foreign Office and the Board of Trade, should          examine and report  on the proposals of the Secretary of  Slate for          Foreign Affairs,  for facilitating  the extension of credits  (whether          for armaments or for other goods)  with certain  foreign  countries,          even  though such transactions may not  be justifiable commercially.    (c) That their Report, together with the Memorandum by the President of the          Board of Trade  (C.I.D. Paper No. 1480-B), arid the above Minutes.          and Conclusions, should be remitted to the Cabinet.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,   November 17,  1938.
