Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.    THE question of a British guarantee for Czechoslovakia first arose at theAnglo-French discussions on the 18th  September,  1938.   In those discussionsM, Daladier suggested that if  we were to demand the sacrifice of the  Sudetenterritory from the Czechs, the latter would naturally ask in return for guarantees.It was felt by the British Ministers that, to quote the words which I used in theHouse of Lords on the 3rd October, &quot; if we were, in conjunction with the FrenchGovernment, to press the Czechoslovak Government to accept proposals so drasticas those which we thought it right to  lay before them in  the Anglo-French plan inorder to preserve Europe as a whole from war, we were bound ourselves to make a counter-contribution to  balance  the reduction  of  Czechoslovakia^ defensivestrength.  In no other circumstances,  I think, should we  have felt morally  justifiedin pressing her Government  to go so  far.&quot;    2.  The Anglo-French proposals presented to the Czechoslovak Governmenton the 19th September accordingly contained a paragraph, (6), to the effect that&quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom  would be prepared, as a contribution to the pacification of Europe, to join in an international guarantee ofthe new  boundaries of  the  Czechoslovak  State against unprovoked aggression.One of the principal conditions of such a guarantee would be the safeguarding ofthe independence of Czechoslovakia  by the substitution of a general guarantee against unprovoked aggression  in  place of existing treaties which  involvereciprocal obligations of a military character.&quot;    3.  This question was discussed by the Cabinet on the 21st September, andthe conclusion was reached that, in regard to the proposed guarantee, the PrimeMinister should, in his resumed negotiations with Herr Hitler, proceed on thebasis (a) that the guarantee is joint and not several; (&amp;) that France, Great Britainand Russia are the joint guarantors;  (c) that Germany should be invited to sign aseparate-pact of non-aggression with  Czechoslovakia; and (d) that if Herr Hitlerobjected to the inclusion of Russia in the joint guarantee, the Prime minister would again refer the matter to the Cabinet.    4.  The annex to  the Munich  Agreement of the  29th September  runs asfollows :          &quot; His Majesty&apos;s  Government in  the United Kingdom and the French    Government have entered into the  above agreement on the basis that they    stand by the offer, contained in paragraph 6 of the Anglo-French proposals      10128  [18201]                                                B
    of the 19th September, relating to  an. international guarantee of the new    boundaries of the Czechoslovak State against  unprovoked aggression.         &quot; When the question of the Polish and Hungarian minorities in Czecho-  ,:. Slovakia has been settled, Germany and Italy for their  part will  give  a    guarantee to Czechoslovakia.&quot;                        &apos;           .    5.  Speaking of this agreement in the House of Lords on the 3rd October, I said that there were &quot; a great many questions connected with this guarantee thatwill require more careful  consideration than has  as  yet been possible to give them.   Such will be whether  its form  should be joint or several;  what states should be invited  to  assume its obligations;  and  in  what circumstances these obligations should be held  to arise.  These matters, and possibly others, will of necessity be matters for early exchange of view between the several Governmentsconcerned.&quot;    6.  On  the following day the Minister for Co-ordination  of Defence madea considered statement on  the guarantee in the following terms :           &quot; The House will realise that the formal treaty of guarantee has yet to be    drawn up and completed  in the normal way, and as the Foreign Secretary    has  stated  in  another place,  there are  some matters  which  must await    settlement between the Governments concerned.  Until that has been done,    technically,  the guarantee cannot be said to  be  in  force.  His  Majesty&apos;s    Government, however, feel  under a moral obligation to Czechoslovakia to    treat the guarantee as being now in force.  In the event,  therefore, of an    act of unprovoked aggression against Czechoslovakia, His Majesty&apos;s Govern-    ment would certainly  feel bound to take all  steps in their power  to  see    that the integrity of Czechoslovakia is preserved.&quot;    7.  On  the 3rd October the  Home  Secretary made the following  statement about the guarantee in the  course of his speech in the House          &quot;Let me say to  the  honourable gentleman opposite,  who asked me  a    specific question, that  we do not in any way contemplate the  exclusion of    Russia.  I believe that the  guarantee, coupled, it may be, with  pacts  of    non-aggression given by this country, France, Germany and Italy, with the    minorities question settled  in  Czechoslovakia,  will make  the  new republic    as safe as Switzerland has been for many generations  in the past  on  the    continent of Europe.&quot;    8.  On the 5th October the Chancellor of the Exchequer referred to Sir S.Hoare&apos;s speech in the following terms :-         &quot; As the Home Secretary stated in this debate, it is our hope that Russia    will be willing to join in  the guarantee of  Czechoslovakia.  It is most    important that she should do so.  The Government have no intention what-    ever  of excluding  Russia  or  trying to  exclude  Russia  from any  future    settlement of Europe.  If outstanding differences are to be resolved, it must    be on the basis of free  consultation with all European Powers.&apos;&apos;                                    II.    9.  It will be convenient to consider  in  the following order the questionsmentioned in my speech in the House of Lords on the 5th October :-    (a)  What States should be invited to assume the obligations of the guarantee ?    (6)  Whether its form should be joint or several?    (c)  In what circumstances the obligations should be held to arise \What States should be invited to assume the obligations of the guarantee ?    10.   It may be said that the real object of a guarantee is to produce a stateof affairs  in which it is highly unlikely to have to be implemented;  the fact thatit  has to  be implemented shows that it  has  failed in its object.   Accordingly,from  the  point of view of the effectiveness of the guarantee as a  deterrent to
 aggression, the more guarantors there are the better, provided either that all the guarantors can-be. relied.upon to implement their guarantee in good faith or that the  terms of the  guarantee  are such that  the defection of one or  more of the guarantors does not prevent, the guarantee from being implemented by, at any rate, a  sufficient number of  the  remainder as  still  to  render  the  guarantee effective. This poin  will be further considered under head (&amp;.).   &apos;     11.   Since the Cabinet considered this question on the 21st September, the situation has changed in various respects :                         &apos;  1         First, by the Munich Agreement, Germany and Italy undertook to give a     guarantee to Czechoslovakia when the question of the Polish and Hungarian     minorities had been settled.         Secondly, the question of the Polish and Hungarian minorities  has now     been settled, with the result that not only does the guarantee by Germany and    - Italy now become possible, but the principal objection to the  inclusion  of     Poland and Hungary among the guarantors disappears.  On the assumption,     therefore, that we wish  the guaranteeing body of  States to be  as strong  as   ; - possible,  Poland, Hungary,  and also Roumania,  should be  invited  to     participate.         Thirdly, the position has been changed by the resignation of Dr. Benes  &apos;j  and the growing realisation in Czechoslovakia that the future of the country     is bound up with that of Germany.  This may have an important effect on     Germany&apos;s  policy towards Czechoslovakia,  and result in Germany being     anxious to preserve under her  influence what remains of the Republic, rather     than further to disrupt it.         Fourthly,  though Poland and  Hungary have  obtained the territories     inhabited by Polish and  Hungarian minorities, they are dissatisfied with the     settlement in that it fails to secure for them the common frontier which they   1 both desire.     12.   The effect of these changes in the situation  may  be summarised  as follows :      (1) There is perhaps less reason to fear an act of aggression by Germany.     (2) There is no possibility of excluding Italy.     (3) Poland and Flungary may still, even after the present settlement,  harbour           designs  which in certain  circumstances  might lead them to acts of           aggression against Czechoslovakia.     13.   It remains true that Germany, Poland, Hungary and perhaps even Italy, will be  guarantors  of doubtful  value,  but the first  three are neighbours of Czechoslovakia.   They are,  therefore, the Powers from  whom the danger  to Czechoslovakia may be expected and the Powers, therefore, from whom guarantees should first be sought.     14.   That Roumania should be included  appears desirable, both on general grounds of strengthening the  guarantee  and  because she is a neighbour of Czechoslovakia.   Whether she would wish to be included  will depend no doubt on whether she is sufficiently well content with the situation  resulting from the territorial adjustments which have been made in Ruthenia, and whether  Poland, her ally, is a guarantor. If Poland and Hungary were included, Roumania might  as she is equally with them  a neighbour of Czechoslovakia wish to be included. It must also be considered whether, if Roumania is included, Yugoslavia, who is also a member of the Little Entente, but not a neighbour of Czechoslovakia, should be included too.   Yugoslavia^ guarantee would be valuable because she  and Roumania are, apart from Germany,  in the best position to keep Hungary in order and thus render a general guarantee effective in the case of acts of aggression by Hungary.    15.  There remains  the  question  of Russia.  Reference  has  been made in paragraphs  7 and 8 above to the  statements by the Home Secretary and theChancellor of the Exchequer on the desirability of including Russia in the guarantee. Indeed, the proposal in the Anglo-French plan that &quot; a general guarantee againstunprovoked aggression &quot; should be substituted for &quot;existing treaties which involve      [18201]                                                    B 2
 reciprocal obligations of a military character &apos;&apos; may be regarded as implying that Russia, which was a party to one such treaty, should participate in the proposed general guarantee.  Despite the obvious disadvantages of excluding Russia, there are, however, considerable difficulties in the way of securingi her  inclusion. - In the first place, Russia herself has never been consulted, and we do not know what her attitude would be.   It may be supposed that she would be ready to join in a guarantee, but: it must also be remembered that she was excluded from all mention in the Munich Agreement, and that one of Herr Hitler&apos;s chief objectives is the exclusion  of Russia from Central Europe and  from all&quot; connexion with Czecho- slovakia.  Signer Mussolini may be expected to support Herr Hitler in this.  (One way out of this difficulty might be to arrange that each  guarantor should sign a separate instrument of guarantee see paragraph 19  (3) below.)  Moreover, Poland made it clear at the  time when negotiations for an Eastern Pact were in progress that she would not collaborate  with Russia in any guarantee, that is to say that she would in no circumstances allow the transit of Russian troops across her territory even if it were to give effect to a  common  guarantee given by each of them to a third country.   There is no reason to suppose that Poland has in any way abandoned this veto, and its existence must reduce considerably the value of including  Russia among the  guarantors of Czechoslovakia.     16.   On the whole, however, the conclusion appears to be that we should endeavour to arrange that Russia should be  a guarantor, but  that it  would be necessary  to reconsider  this if it becomes apparent that  insistence on Russia&apos;s participation would lead to  a breakdown of the entire scheme owing to German or Italian objections. Should the Form of  the Guarantee be Joint  or Several f     17. .  The Cabinet have  already rejected the idea of a several guarantee on the ground that we cannot accept a position  in which we might be called upon to implement our undertaking single-handed.  The guarantee must, therefore, to some extent  at any rate, be joint, but if  all the States mentioned in  para-. graphs 11-15 (who include  all the  possible aggressors)  are to be  guarantors, it is obvious that  a strictly joint guarantee, which  w^ould  only become operative if all  the  guarantors agreed to act, would, from the point of view of Czecho- slovakia,  not be worth  the  paper it was written  on.  It would in  any  event be necessary to provide that  the fact of one of the guarantors being the aggressor would not prevent  the  guarantee of the others becoming operative,  provided that they  were unanimously of opinion  that the casus fosderis had arisen.   But this would not suffice if the  guarantee is to possess any real effectiveness; for it would still be possible for,  e.q., Germany  to ensure that  the guarantee should not operate in the event of aggression by her, by arranging with Italy or Hungary that that  Power should not join in the aggression against Czechoslovakia but should simply decline to fulfil her  guarantee  either by alleging  that no act of unprovoked aggression had been committed or on some other pretext. A guarantee which left this  possibility open could hardly  be defended as a fulfilment of  the offer made to Czechoslovakia  in the Anglo-French proposals of&apos;the 19th September. If so, it is necessary to find a way round this difficulty, bearing in mind that the larger the number  of guarantors whose  consent is  necessary to bring  the guarantee into operation, the more effective wilkbe the assistance which they could give to Czechoslovakia, but the less the likelihood of such consent being obtained.     18.   On the other hand, if the primary  object is  to deter  Germany  from attacking  Czechoslovakia, it is essential that she should know that, if she does so, she will be faced by a block of States which, in view of their combined strengthtand their geographical situation, she would not be prepared to challenge.   In that case, if the British guarantee is to serve the purpose for which it  is intended, it could  only operate when the co-operation of such  a block of  States is assured. For instance, on geographical and strategic grounds and in view of Germany&apos;s military superiority  in the air and  on land, a guarantee limited  to, say, France and Great Britain could probably not be effectively implemented  in the  present circumstances, and for this reason would not act as a deterrent.  This would be still more the case if Italy arid  Czechoslovakia^  neighbours  were not merely neutral, but were to support Germany.
     19.  The Annex to the Munich Agreement leaves open the question whetherthe Anglo-French guarantee on the. one hand, and the guarantees to be given byGermany and Italy on the other, are to be combined or separate.  There are, atany rate, three possibilities :-V  . -                                 , .-     (1) The Franco-British guarantee would be given by a separate instrument,           and the guarantees given  by other Powers would be quite independent           of  the Frafrco-British guarantee (they might also be independent one           of  another) and given  in a separate instrument. It would be possible,           if Russia were willing to come in, and if this did not lead to the break-           down of  the whole scheme owing to German objections, to make the           former guarantee a tripartite one; this is really the position originally           contemplated by the Cabinet.     (2) The guarantees to be given by the four.Powers would  be combined in a           single instrument, to which any other Power, such  as Russia, which           was prepared to give a guarantee could be a party.     (3) The guarantee of each Power would be given by a separate instrument,           but.would recite the guarantees given by the other guarantors, and its           application would be dependent on the co-operation  of, at any rate, a           certain number of the other guaranteeing Powers.    20.  If course (1) were adopted,  the position would be comparatively simple.There  would   be   a  joint  guarantee  under  which  the  two  (or  three)Powers would  agree  to come together  to the  assistance  of Czechoslovakiain  the event of their  all  being  of opinion  that the  casus  fcederis  had arisen.  One objection to this course is that it would tend to divide the guarantorPowers into two groups, the League Powers on one side and the  totalitarianPowers on  the other, and thus to emphasise ideological differences which it is thepolicy of His Majesty&apos;s Government to seek to override.  From the practical pointof view, the question would be whether such a combination would be sufficient to deter&apos; possible aggressors, having  regard to the considerations set forth in para-graph 18 and bearing in mind the  difficulty of making  the Russian guaranteeeffective in view of the Polish veto as explained in paragraph 15.    21.  If course (2) were adopted, and the guarantee were a joint one, it wouldbe necessary  (particularly if the number of guarantors were as large  as issuggested in paragraphs  11-15) to prevent the guarantee becoming inoperativein any particular case either because  one of the guarantors did not agree that thecasus fcederis had arisen, or because one of the guarantors had itself committedthe act of aggression.  The following might be a possible scheme.  The questionwhether the casus fcederis had  arisen would be one for the joint decision of theguarantors. If  they all agreed that it had, they would all come to the assistanceof Czechoslovakia.  If they did  not  agree (or if one of them was  the  allegedaggressor), but not less than (three) of them held that the casus fcederis had arisen,those (three) (or more) would be bound to intervene, acting together.  The actualnumber would be a matter for consideration; the irreducible  minimum  is  two,and a larger number than three might be possible, bearing in mind the considera-tions stated in paragraph 17  (last sentence) and paragraph 18.  But even so, thenecessary number of Powers to bring the guarantee into force might be composedof countries which would not be materially in a position  to make the guaranteeeffective.  To get over this difficulty it might be possible to group the guarantorsinto  two categories  (a) the Great Powers, comprising for this purpose GreatBritain, France, Germany, Italy, Poland and perhaps Russia,  and (&amp;) the other powers who are, prepared to undertake to give a  guarantee.   The minimum ofguarantors required to bring the guarantee into  force would be sought solelyamong the Powers in category (a) irrespective  of  the attitude adopted by thePowers in category (b).   It is suggested that the best  course would be to provide that the minimum  of guarantors should be four out  of  the six Powers in category (a).    22.  If course (3) were adopted,  it would be for each guarantor to decide for itself whether the casus fcederis  had  arisen, but if it so decided, the questionwhether it was  then bound to implement its guarantee  would (in the case, ofguarantors who wished to make  this condition) be dependent on willingness to takecorresponding action by a certain number of the other guarantors.  In our  owncase it  is suggested that this  minimum  should be the  same  as in course  (2),
  i.e.,  three out  of  the  following  Powers, France, Germany, Italy,  Poland  and  Russia.  Under such  an  arrangement  consultation between the guarantors, or  some of  them,  would in practice be necessary when circumstances  arose which  might be regarded as bringing  the guarantees  into operation,  and, therefore,  although each** guarantee would be separate, there would necessarily be a certain  practical connexion between them.  In what Circumstances should the Obligations of the Guarantee be held to arise.       23.  Under courses (1) and (2) suggested  in  paragraph  19 the question  whether the casus fcederis had arisen would be one  for the joint decision of the  guarantors, or some of them.  Under scheme (3) the question would be one for the  separate decision of each guarantor, which would in practice only be taken after  consultation with the other guarantors,  or some of them.  The alternative of con-  fiding the decision to some  outside body, such as the Council of the League, would  not be possible in the present case.       24.  As  to the facts  which  should bring the guarantee into operation, the  existing  French (and consequently the  existing  Russian)  guarantee comes into  operation in  the event of  a violation of the Czech-German Arbitration Treaty  accompanied by an unprovoked recourse to arms by Germany.  This would hardly  be a satisfactory basis for the new guarantee, especially as the Arbitration Treaty  was, in practice, ignored in the recent  crisis.  One possibility would be for all  Czechoslovakia^ neighbours to enter into non-aggression undertakings with her  (either by way of regular non-aggression treaties  or by something on the lines of  the existing  Belgian  arrangements),  and for Czechoslovakia to be  guaranteed  against a violation of any  one of these  undertakings.  The guarantors would no  doubt require to be consulted as  to the terms of  these undertakings.  An  alter-  native would be to guarantee the  maintenance of the territorial status quo result-  ing from the new  frontiers of Czechoslovakia (cf. Article  1 of Locarno), and to  combine this with a reference to &apos;&apos; unprovoked aggression &apos;&apos;; the question whether  such aggression had occurred in any particular case would then be one to be deter-  mined by the guarantors.  On the  whole the second alternative would be preferable  inasmuch as guarantor States would not be tied down to any specific  definition in  the non-aggression pacts  as  to  what  should be held  to  constitute an act of  unprovoked aggression.       25.  It is clear that discussions with Czechoslovakia  and some at any rate  of the proposed guarantors will  be necessary before much further progress can  be made.  Moreover, as under paragraph 6 of the Anglo-French proposals the new  guarantee is  to be substituted for &apos;&apos; existing treaties which involve reciprocal  obligations of a military  character,&quot; Czechoslovakia^ existing commitments to  France  and Russia will have to disappear  simultaneously with the  conclusion  of the new guarantee arrangements, and this involves the consent of the two latter  Powers.   As  Czechoslovakia^ undertaking to Russia  only becomes operative  in the event  of France lending assistance to Russia, it is conceivable that the  position  of the Franco-Soviet  Pact might come under discussion.       26.  Czechoslovakia^  existing commitments under  the  Little Entente  will  also have to disappear, for Czechoslovakia on the one hand and Roumania and  Yugoslavia on the other are bound to come to each  other&apos;s defence  in the event  of an unprovoked  attack on one  of them by Flungary.  So far as we are aware,  Czechoslovakia is  not bound to any other country by reciprocal obligations of a  military character.                                      III.       27.  Finally we must  consider whether  circumstances might arise in which    our guarantee could be held to have lapsed.  Were Slovakia or Ruthenia to break  away from Czechoslovakia and either  establish independent States or else  join  Hungary or Poland it is clear that a new position would  arise and it might be  argued  that the guarantee we have given to the new Czechoslovak State would  no  longer  apply.   It  certainly would  not  apply to the  territories which  had  broken away.       28.  Similarly a new position would arise  were Czechoslovakia to join in  a union  with Germany which was  so close as to amount to  a virtual alienation  of the independence of the republic.  Even if this does not happen,  it is possible
that Czechoslovakia may move so. much into the German orbit as to make theguarantee unnecessary and anomalous.  For  this and other reasons, the questionof the. duration of the  new  guarantees  and the circumstances in which  theycould be terminated will require consideration.                                   IV.    29.  The  Czechoslovak Minister for Foreign Affairs has recently, in  con-versation with His Majesty&apos;s Minister, shown some anxiety to have the promisedguarantee of the four  Munich Powers brought into force as soon as possible.The question  of  how this matter is to  be  approached will clearly require tobe considered  by  the Powers chiefly concerned, and I would suggest that,  as  a first step, we should take the opportunity of the forthcoming conversations  with french Ministers in Paris to exchange views with the French Government.   we might suggest to  the French  Government that they, in their turn, should sound the Soviet Government as to their attitude.   When the views, at any rate, of theFrench Government are known, we might ask the German and Italian Govern-ments whether they have any proposals to make.
