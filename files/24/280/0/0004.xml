EXPORT CREDITS LEGISLATION.                 Note by the President of the Board of Trade.         1.     The Export Guarantees Act 1937,  which consolidated         and amended previous Acts on this subject, empowers  the         Board of Trade with the consent  of the Treasury  and  after         consultation with an Advisory Committee to give  guarantees         in connection with the export of goods from the  United  Kingdom,         excluding munitions of war.  The limit of  the aggregate amount         of guarantees which may be outstanding was fixed by  this Act         at  50 millions.         2.     Legislation is urgently required to amend this Act,         primarily to increase this limit.  Since the Act of  1957         was passed the Anglo-Turkish Guarantee Agreement has been         signed.  An amount of about  14  millions has to  be  earmarked         for the purposes of that Agreement and this figure,  when         added to other amounts guaranteed and earmarked  brings  the         total at the present date to nearly  45 millions. This leaves         little margin for the normal growth of work and  practically         nothing for any new Agreements that might be concluded  with         other countries.  I propose to discuss with the  Chancellor         of the Exchequer the amount of the new limit.         3.     An amendment is also required to enable the         Department to utilise more effectively its power to  give         guarantees for the purpose of establishing or encouraging         trade between the United Kingdom and any country.  This         applies particularly to payment  for services (e.g.   of        &quot; consulting engineers).  The Act  of 1937 attempted to provide
for these problems hut has proved too restrictive underthe constantly changing conditions of international trade.It is therefore desirable that the powers, conferred by further legislation should be as wide as possible to enablethe Department to deal with any new problems likely to arise in future in the commercial field.4.     The question of extending the Export credits guarantee Scheme to munitions of war is a matter on whichI am submitting a separate report to the Committee ofImperial Defence.  There will be ample time to take intoaccount any decision on that report before the legislation is finally framed.5.     I therefore request approval for the preparation witha view to its early introduction of legislation to amend the Export Guarantees Act 1937 in respect of the following matters:-   (1)     The increase in the limit of guarantees           which may at any time be outstanding;   (2)     The extension of the Departments powers           to give guarantees for the purpose of           establishing  r encouraging trade between           the United Kingdom and any country.O.P.G.S.Board of Trade.4th November, 1&apos;
