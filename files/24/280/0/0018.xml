I      I attach, for the consideration of my colleagues, adraft of the statement to be made in the House ofCommons on Thursday next regarding the governments proposals for national&apos;voluntary service.                              J.A.                       r28th November, 1938.
                  CABINET.            NATIONAL  VOLUNTARY SERVICE.Draft of Statement to be made in the House of Commons.     1.   In His Majesty&apos;s Most Gracious Speech it was statedthat, side by side with my duties in organising the preparationof measures for Civil Defence., I would also be responsiblefor devising a plan for &quot;the effective utilisation of theresources of the nation for national voluntary service&quot;.I have now been able to bring this problem under review inall its aspects, and I am in a position to-day to state in broad outline the measures which the Government have decidedto adopt to ensure that our rnan-power, and woman-power, is organised in the most effective and practical way for the voluntary service of the State.     2.   During the last few months there has been muchspeculation about a compulsory National Register.  Afterweighing very carefully all the arguments which can beadduced on either side, the Government have come to theconclusion that a compulsory Register is not at presentnecessary or desirable.  It may become necessary, as I shallexplain.  But, for the reasons which will appear from, what i shall have to say later in the course of this statement, weare satisfied that all the immediate needs of the situationcan be best met by a voluntary Register, combined - as we intend that it shall be combined - with proper measures for ensuring that all who wish to serve their country shall&apos;havethe means of knowing how their services can best be utilised.     3.   The first step will be to publish a Handbook orGuide containing particulars of all the services for whichvolunteers are required - the Regular Forces, the territorial and Reserve Forces and the various services of Civil Defence,
including the police, the fire services, nursing and the like - and living a clear indication of the types of men andwomen who can most suitably volunteer for each.  A full listwill also be made available of all the key occupations whichin time of war would become so essential to the war-effort ofthe nation that persons above a certain age who are engagedin them could not be spared for any other form of nationalservice.-  It will be made clear that these persons can bestserve the State by remaining at their posts if war should come.That is the form of national service in which they can be most useful, and it is from outside their ranks that the Governmentwill look to find the recruits for all the various defence services.  The Ministry of Labour have already done a greatdeal of preliminary work in classifying the various occupationsto be put on this special list; but in settling the finaldetails the Government are anxious to enlist the co-operationof the interests concerned, and my right honourable Friend, theMinister of Labour, is taking immediate steps to bring into.consultation representatives of both the employers and theworkers.     4.   For the Handbook we propose the widest possible-distribution - we intend that a copy shall be delivered to every household throughout the country.  The special list of vital occupations will, however, be too lengthy to be incorporated in full in this Handbook.  The full list will beintended mainly for reference and the Handbook will containmerely a general indication of its purpose, telling anyone whois in doubt as to his own position where he can obtain advice.For further publicity for the scheme as a whole I am sure wecan rely on the invaluable assistance of the Press.     4A.  Alternative   The Haudbook and this special list of                        &apos;                ...... &quot; -vital occupations will be lengthy documents intended mainly
for reference and will be unsuitable for general circulation to all members of the public.  Copies will be&apos;made readily available all over the country and leaflets will be circulatedgiving all the information which is of general interest to all sections of the community and supplemented by widespreadpublicity, for which I am confident that we can rely on theinvaluable assistance of the press.     5.   In addition, steps will be taken at once to buildup a national service organisation with local Committees through-out the country., by whom full information and guidance can begiven to assist individual men and women to decide where their duty lies and to make their choice between the various formsof national service which are open to them.     6.   I hope that it may be possible to prepare anddistribute all this literature, and to bring this new organisation into being,, by about the middle of January, andwe then propose to launch a co-ordinated recruiting campaign&apos;for all the various services for which volunteers are required.In this new recruiting effort we shall not supersede any ofthe existing recruiting organisations.  We shall work in collaboration with them;  but there will be better co-ordina- tion so as to prevent the various services from competingwastefully with one another in the same field and to ensure,so far as possible, that men or women well qualified for one service shall not be recruited into another for which theyare less well suited.  We propose further that people whovolunteer for certain classes of civilian service should beinvited to undertake a more definite obligation of a contractual nature than has been expected of them hitherto.     7-   Our aim is to enrol by these means, early in theNew Year, a sufficient number of recruits to bring the numbersof volunteers up to the estimated requirements of each of the
                                                            2 it Svarious services.  We hope also to obtain an adequate numberof reserves f-or each service.  Volunteers have already come forward in very large numbers, and I have every expectation that by the means which I have outlined the full numbers required will be readily attainable.;.  I believe that the peopleof this country will respond at once to any further call, assoon as they are told how their services can best be utilised.We are indeed justified in expecting that volunteers will come forward in greater numbers than are required for our immediateneeds, and I therefore propose to make provision for thebalance in an unallocated reserve which will be registered withthe National Service Organisation to be set up under theMinistry of Labour.     8.   While these preparations are being completed, Ipropose to press forward at once with the expansion of thearrangements for training, in order to be ready to deal witha large increase in the number of volunteers.  Each service will of course be primarily responsible for the training ofits own recruits; but it may well be that in some directionsthe facilities available may not at first be sufficient toenable all who volunteer to enter immediately upon the fulltraining required for the particular service they&apos; have chosen.For these it is proposed to organise some more generalpreliminary instruction in the principles of civil defence whichwill be of use to them in whatever branch they intend to serve.We propose ultimately to go further.  Under conditions ofmodejrn       warfare it will be important that every citizenshould understand, not only the nature of the precautionswhich can be taken to reduce the risks of injury from gas,incendiary bombs and high explosives, but also how the problemsof civil defence may react upon the normal activities of thecommunity.  It has now become a part of the ordinary duties of
citizenship  to acquire  some  elementary knowledge  of thesematters and  we hope,  therefore,  that  in due  course it may befound possible to  extend  such  instruction as&apos;I have mentionedso that it may be  made  more  generally available and, so faras practicable, widened  in  scope.     9.   When these  proposals have been implemented, we shallhave registers of  ail the volunteers  enrolled for all thevarious Reserve, Auxiliary and Civil  Defence services, registers of those earmarked as reserves for the various services anda register of the  unallocated  reserves.  In  addition, special arrangements are being  made  for  the compilation of a separateregister of  persons possessing exceptional professional or .technical qualifications.  These registers,  together with&apos;the records already available of men included in the  speciallist of vital occupations, will  constitute our NationalVoluntary Register.   It is true  that  we shall not have one central Register,  but the Registers which we shall have willbe all the more valuable  because they will be availablelocally in the districts, and  with the services,  for whichthey will be required.  I believe that these separateRegisters will be  sufficient to  serve all our practical needsboth before  an emergency  arises  and also for the  first fewmonths thereafter.     10.  Our plans do  not,  however,  stop there.  Soon afterthe outbreak of a  war we  should  need  a complete NationalRegister, and to ensure completeness  it would have to becompiled under compulsory powers.  Such a Register would be^required as  a basis for an effective  system  of food rationing,and to enable the  whole of the national resources both of man-power and woman-power to  be  marshalled and conserved for a conflict which might  be prolonged. 4 The vital difference betweenpre-war requirements  and  war requirements is that in war it  is
essential to survey and marshal our resources as a whole;for this purpose the registration only of volunteers would notbe sufficient and it would be necessary to compile a universalRegister.  To be effective, however, such a Register must beup-to-date, and this condition can be satisfied only if it iscompiled at the time.when the occasion for its use arises.I am satisfied that the compilation of a complete Registerought to be postponed until an emergency has arisen; but at thesame time I think it expedient to undertake preparations nowwhich would make it possible to compile that Register very quickly if the need were ever to arise.  I therefore proposeto prepare certain machinery for that purpose at once, whichcan be done very readily and at trifling cost by taking advantage of the organisation for the census which will be due in the ordinary course in 1941.  If this preparation were notundertaken in advance, the time required to compile a completeRegister on the outbreak of war would extend to many months;if it is undertaken now, the time required would be not morethan three weeks, and during that period and for some time.afterwards the man-power provided under the system of the voluntary register already described would be fully adequate to meet the needs of the situation, that is unless ourcalculations are going to be completely falsified in regard tothe potentialities, not indeed of a voluntary register merely but of voluntary service itself, which r as the House recognises -must be the basis of any plans we make now.  The transition fromthe voluntary register to the complete compulsory registerwould be smooth, easy and expeditious.  I am bold enough to hope that these arrangements will.satisfy all who, without beingpedantically attached to any particular method, share the determination of His Majesty&apos;s Government that the nation&apos;resources in man power shall be effectively organised andemployed.
