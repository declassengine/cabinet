MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES AND                 THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SCOTLAND.       1.    We submit the following proposals for the amendment of the       Bacon Industry Act, which received the Royal Assent in July last,       for the consideration of the Cabinet*       2.    Our colleagues will recall the main principles of the       Bacon Industry Act, which were that -          (i) for a period of taree years producers should be guaranteed               a pig price varying with food costs,         (ii) for the same period curers should be guaranteed an               operating margin,        (iii) the industry is required to rationalise  during the three               years so as to be able to meet unaided  any recurrence  of               the conditions which rendered assistance under the Act               necessary.       3*    So far as the Act was concerned the margin allowed to the       curers was 7s. 3d. per cwt. of bacon together -with the value of       the offals.  At the time the Bill was under consideration the       latter item represented 9s., thus making the total margin 16s. 3d,       This margin was subject to a reduction of 5d. at the end of. the       first year and a further lOd. at the end of the second year,       representing the economies which the industry might be expected to      . make in that time.             Although a total margin of 16s. 3d., of which 9s.       represented the value of offals, v/as in our minds and was the       ba^sis on which discussions with the Treasury and with- other       Departments were conducted, no provision was in fact made in       the Bill to stabilise the returns which curers  would obtain       from their offals.       We omitted to do so for two reasons.       In the first place, it seemed difficult to provide for the       stabilisation of returns from lard without also providing
 for  the  stabilisation of the  returns from other  offals, which,  for technical  reasons would  have been  a matter  of considerable  complexity.   In the  second  place,  we believed that tfeere was  a reasonable expectation that lard prices would  maintain  themselves - an expectation which was  shared by the leaders  of the industry when they  considered and with some reluctance accepted the  price structure on  which the Bill was  based.    This expectation has not been  realised,  as lard prices have fallen from  66s.  per cwt. to 50s. per cwt,, thereby reducing the  curers&apos;  margin by about Is. .7d,  per cwt. At the same time that  market  conditions have revealed a serious loophole in  the provisions of the  Act, an opportunity has  occurred  owing to  the removal  of the  import  duty  on lard for  taking isolated  action in the  case of  lard without the complication  of  legislating for the subsidiary offals;  the returns from  lard constitute  75^ of the total returns from offals. 4.         The x^osition is, of course, made worse by the removal of the duty, but  as regards this the  Cabinet  has already decided,  with  the  concurrence of the  Chancellor, (Cab. 36  (38) Conclusion  3(c)), that having  regard to the special financial  conditions  under which the  bacon industry will be working  during the next three years  proper compensation should be  paid to  the  industry for that period.   It  would no doubt be possible  to measure  statistically the extent of the compensation which would be appropriate in relation solely to the removal of  the  duty, but for the reasons stated above we advocate that  the opportunity should be taken to stabilise the  curers&apos; returns from  lard and  so implement the full                                                              i intention of the  Act.           Our colleagues will appreciate that we are  not asking for an addition  to  the curers&apos;  margin but that we only seek to ensure that they get what  it was thought that theywould require.   V7e recognise that the stabilisation  of the                        2.
 lard  returns  will more  than  compensate  curers for the losj^sj which they  will  suffer  merely from the  removal of the duty, hut we suggest as additional arguments  in favour of our proposals that they will  avoid  the necessity of attempting to assess the exact measure  of  compensation which the industry  should  have, and -  a still more important consideration -  that they will  enable a case to be made for the necessary amendment of the  Bacon Industry Act on grounds which will  not in any way compromise the principle that the Government  cannot accept  responsibility for losses said to result from reductions  or removals of duties,,  The proposal can be defended  not so  much  on  the ground of affording the curers compensation against  the removal of the duty but on the wider ground of ensuring the fulfilment of the- Government  policy to which effect was given last July, 5,        We  have had to  consider carefully whether the plan will  contravene  any of  the principles incorporated in the Act,  and we advise our  colleagues that  it will not do so,         Details of our proposals are contained in an appendix  to this memorandum, 6,        Amendments to the  Bacon Industry Acta We seek also the agreement of our.colleagues to two  amendments of the Bacon Industry Act to resolve minor difficulties of administration, 7o        The first difficulty  concerns the curing in this country of  imported pigs  and carcases of pigs,,  A-rrangements are in force  with the principal Dominion countries which export pigs or carcases,  and with importers from foreign countries,  by which pigs  and carcases intended for bacon
curing  in Great  Britain are  accompanied by  &quot;quota  certificates&apos;stating that  the pigs  or carcases  are  imported  for thepurpose of bacon curing.   It  was  the  intention that  curersshould  be able freely  to  buy pigs  and  carcases  with thesecertificates  and to produce  bacon  from them.          Section  19 (3)  ef  the Bacon  Industry  Act providesthat a  carer  may buy and  cure  imported carcases  if it isshown*  in a manner laid down In regulations,  that  the pig wastaken into account for the purposes of orders or arrangements&quot;regulating the  importation&quot; of pigs and carcases.    It isdoubtful if some of the  arrangements referred to come withinthe expression &quot;regulating the importation&quot; of  pigs orcarcases, and in the&apos;case of foreign countries  sendingcarcases both for pork and  for bacon  curing it  does notappear  to be  feasible  to  regulate  separately the importationfor bacon curing.          It  is desired,  therefore, to amend Section 19 (3)so that a curer may buy and produce bacon from  imported pigs and carcases, provided they  .have been taken into  account inany arrangement approved by  the Minister&apos; relating  to the useof imported pigs and carcases  for bacon production in GreatBritain.   Such an amendment ?/ould enable the Minister to approve the &quot;quota certificate&quot; arrangements referred to above.8.        The second difficulty concerns Section 28 of the Act.This Section provides  that, depending  on the quantity ofbacon made from a  pig,  a  curer is entitled to recover from,or (as  the case may be) is required to pay to,  the minister the additions to,  or subtractions from, the pig  price which fall to be made on account of  pig feeding costs.          The intention of the Act was to enable a curer to recover the whole  of his  food  cost payment if he turned thewhole of the  curable part of the pig into bacon.   It wasnecessary therefore to assume  in the Act a normal  proportion
(by weight) of the carcase which represented the wholeof the curable part of the pig.   That proportion is&amp;p of the dead weight of the pig.   It will be noted thatthis proportion represents an average;  some carcases will&quot;dress out&quot; at slightly more than 7Qp&apos;, others a little less.          Section 28(3) contemplates that the curer shallsupply proof of the weight of bacon made from each pig.If curers are compelled to weigh separately each part of acarcase that becomes bacon, it will mean that no curer willbe able to recover the whole of his food cost payment, evenalthough he turns the whole of the curable parts of thepigs into bacon, because some of the carcases will inevitably&quot;dress out&quot; at less than 78/c,   Moreover, the detailed workof weighing and recording separately the proportions ofbacon made from individual pigs would seriously slow downfactory operations and increase curing costs.          It is desired therefore to amend Section 28 so thatit will be sufficient for curers in their monthly claims to prove, as regards each style of bacon, that a total weightof bacon was made from a total dead weight of pigs.   Thiswould enable curers to weigh carcases in batches as they go into curing tanks.9.     Conclusion.   We commend these proposals to theCabinet and ask for authority, in principle, for thepreparation and early introduction of a Bill to give effectto them.
             LARD PR ICE  IHc!uRi:NCE  SCK^IS.          The  scheme  Is  to he  linked to  the Bacon industry act, I.e. subsidy is  to  be paid  only on  long-contract  pigs.Curers will be compensated if  lard prices  fall  below a standard price end will  recoup the Exchequer  if they riseabove  the standard price.          The  prices  used for  the  purposes of  ascertainmentshould.be the  wholesale  prices of  American lard.    TheMinister, with the consent of  the  Treasury, should prescribeby regulation  how  this  price  should be  ascertained and  Inrelation to what description of  American lard.    BoxedAmerican lard  (56 lb. boxes) is  a  standard article inevery-clay commercial  use and might be  taken for this purpose.          It Is  suggested that a standard  price of 65s.  percwt., which was  approximately  the  price  of boxed  Americanlard when the  bacon price formula  was  devised,  would beapp.ropria.te.   This price would  apply  to the first contractperiod, and would be  subject to  a  taper  In the  second  and third periods,  as In  the case  of the pig and bacon prices in the Bacon Industry Act.   Appropriate prices for thesecond and,third years would be  63s. and 59s.    This would represent a reduction of the margin by about 2.4c!. per cwt.In the second  year and by a further 4,8d.  ih the  third year.It will be noted that this taper will  be additional to thereduction In the margin, provided  in the Bacon Industry  act of 5d, per cwt.  in the second  year and a further  lOd.  Inthe third year.          The  yield of lard per  pig varies as  between  theWiltshire side carcase and the Midland carcase,  which  is notonly heavier but fatter.   The yield from  a Wiltshire  side
 8  score  carcase may toe  10  lb.    P.fom a Midland  10  score . carcase  the yield may he 18  lb.   As a national average  it  is probable that  the yield per  pig  will &quot;not  exceed one-tenth cwt.  of  lard.           On this yield basis, a change of  Is.  per cwt.  in large prices equals r,2d.  per 7  score pig or per cwt.  of bacon, A  variation of Id. ;oer  cwt.  of bacon&apos; should fully  cover  the &quot;Wiltshire  curer and,  although less  than the real cost  to the industry as a  whole,  might be taken as the  basis of compensation under a  price insurance scheme.    Assuming  a standard price of 65s.  and on the basis of  the  current price of American lard today  of  about  50s., then  the  national price of 94s.  9d, per cwt. of bacon would be increased for the month  of December by 15d. to 96s. Od, Cost to  the Exchequer,           The  cost to the Exchequer will  depend on two factors, namely,  the course of lard prices and the numbers  of contract pigs;  both, and particularly the former, are difficult to estimate.           In 19-34, the  worst of  the slump years, the average price of American lard  was 36s.  per cwt.    If prices fell again to this  low level for  the  whole year  December, 1938, to November,  1939 (which seems  improbable),  the maximum cost to the Exchequer  on this year&apos;s contract total of  about 1-g- million pigs would be  186,000.   If prices  continue at their present  level of  50s. per  cwt. for  the whole year, the cost would be  about  94,000.           If lard prices continue at the  same level for the second and third contract years  and on the  basis of 1,800,000 and 2 million  contract  pigs  in those years  respectively, the cost would be   98,000 and  75,000.          As a set-off  to these  figures,  the sharp fall in the cost of  feeding-stuffs  which has occurred in the past fewmonths and which does not appear, yet to have stopped, is likely
