Appreciation of the i-political  Situation,  by theGovernment of India, dated 21st November,  1938.     Circulated for the information of  the Cabinet by theSecretary of Stats for India.
Confidential appreciation of the political situationin India,,  dated, the 21st November,  1938, issued on the   authority of the Secretary ox State for India. 1-    Provincial Admi administration,    The  agitation for the  release  of the  terrorist  convicts in Bengal  is  being exploited by the  provincial Congress Committee in  the  hope  of upsetting  the Ministry.   Cn November 11th most of the  convicts went  on hunger-strike  for  three  days  on the pretext of  certain grievances against  their treatment in the jails.   It is  reported that two Muslims were added  to the Ministry on November 17th.   These are leaders of two sections  of the &quot;froja&quot; party;  and their  enlistment may  be expected  to strengthen the Ministry&apos;s resistance to  the designs of  Congress.   The  Government have  announced the personnel of a Land  Revenue Commission under the  Chairmanship of Sir Francis Floud, which  will  examine the existing land  revenue system and  advise  whether modifications are  desirable.      The North-West Frontier Ministry in a legislative  session. which began on November 3rd  has escaped  defeat in  various trials of  strength by the narrow margin  of 3 votes.   A contentious Agriculturist  Debtors&apos; Relief  Bill  has emerged inom- the Selec t Canmittee and is  under consideration.  Gandhi&apos;s visit to the province ended on November  9th;  it attracted little public interest 5  and appears to have had no important  effect  on the political life of the  Province.      In the United Provinces  legislature consideration has begun of the Tenancy Bill as amended by  the Select Committee.  -The^Ministry claims- that the&apos; Bill  is  a fair  compromise between the extravagant demands of the agrarian left wing and  the traditional rights of -the-lahdholdere . Among  the latter a movement to  obtain the arbitration of the Congress  Working Committee in the hope of getting better terms has  come  to  nothing owing to  the opposition of  a section of the landholders.   The Madhe-Sahaba (Lucknow)
 dispute between  Sunnis  and.Shias has  again been  threatening  but negotiations for  a  settlement are  in progress.   In Delhi the  communal situation has  improved but disobedience continues  of the order  which forbids  demonstrations in support of the claim of Hindus  to  the disputed  site. 2.    Labour.   The Trades Dispute Bill was passed by the Bombay assembly on November 4th and is now under discussion in  the Council.   Asa protest against the-terms&amp;f the Bill which are considered by the communists and other left-wing elements to fetter  unduly the &quot;right to strike7&apos;,  a general strike  in Bombay and  some otherurban -areas was organised on November 7th.  In  Bombay 60 of the77 mills and factories  opened and  about half the workersattended,.    In other industrial centres in the  presidency therewas less response to the call to strike.  In Bombay city therewere serious disturbances which compelled the police to openfire)  11 people were injured by the  firing, of whom  one died.About 75 persons  including 11 policemen were injured in the day&apos;sriots.   The Government can claim  to  have handled  the situation with firmness and success;  and to have once more  shown their capacity for pursuing a definite policy without yielding toclamour and for dealing effectively with a challenge to public order.   They have announced the intention of appointing acommittee  to enquire into the disturbances.   3-n Bengal a recent message states  that 24000 workers ineight jute mills went on strike on November 14th as a protest against the refusal of the management of one mill to reinstatesome  workers who were dismissed for conducting  propaganda against an ordinance to regulate the  jute industry which was issued by  the Provincial Government in September;  the ordinance.permits the Government to control  hours of working of the mills.and the number of looms in each mill  and is designed to preventthe progressive deterioration in the  industry caused by
                                                              292unrestrained over-production.   There was a strike&apos;in the middle of October in mills inMadura, in the Madras presidency;  150-picksters had to be arrested and., the police had to disj^erse a crowd of strikers by force.  The mills have been kept working.  At the- end of  themonth the chief agitator, a member of the Provincial Legislature,was arrested as well as many more picketers.3.     Congress___and the States.   The Congress pretence of non-interference in the affairs of States enables the party to disclaim responsibility for political unrest and disorder fomented in the States by localCongress organisations, sometimes with the active aid of  congress leaders from British India.  A growing problem arises from theassistance given by Congress sympathisers in British India totheir fellow-agitators in the States.  Activities in Orissa havethus encouraged trouble in the small adjoining States, and similarinterference is reported in the Nangaon State which is borderedby the Central provinces.  A Provincial Government has power, by applying certain provisions of the Indian States (Protection) Act1934, to prevent activities of this kind within its own borders.The Punjab Government have brought these provisions into  force toassist one of the lunjab States.  The Orissa Government have refused to do so on behalf of the Dhenkanal State.4.     The Central legislature.   A special session of the Central Assembly began on November10th in New Delhi.  The chief business before the House is theconsideration of the report of the Select Committee on thevoluminous Income-Tax Bill.5*     General Items.   There has been little comment on the &quot;decisions of -HisMajesty&apos;s Government concerning Palestine.   The.abandonment ofthe partition proposals has been generally ,welcomed, but Muslimsare suspicious of the outcome of the negotiations now to  be conducted.  Jinnah, the President of the Muslim League, still
demands the abandonment of :tha.polioyfounded  on  the balfour declaration.   The Chatfield Commission  on  Indian  Defence, has arrived  inIndia. . Congress leaders who wore invited  to  give evidence before it have refused the invitation  on the  grounds that india&apos;s defence is the exclusive concern of India, and that noIndian has been appointed on the Commission.s-    Economic.   Acute distress owing to failure.of  rains and scarcity of foodprevails in the south-east of the runjab:  the provincial government have undertaken relief measures on a large scale.  InDelhi province also the crops have failed  and there is acutescarc-ity of fodder;  and in Ajmer-Merwara  conditions areunsati s fact o ry.7.     Waz 1 rigtari.   The situation has on the whole been quieter, but this is -probably due to the religious month of fasting which began onthe 26th October. - The Faqir of Ipi is still  in inaccessiblecountry North West of Razmak and shows no  signs of making peace,although an indirect approach has been made to him.  Sniping of posts in North Waziristan has been fairly  frequent and there havebeen a few casualties among the troops.    There have been 4 raidsin the Bannu district;  3 Hindus were  kidnapped.  Two Hindus anda Sikh have been kidnapped in tribal territory, the- Sikh beingkilled shortly after his capture.  A number of Hindus previouslykidnapped-have,  however, been released mostly as a result of pressure brought to bear on the Bhitannis.
