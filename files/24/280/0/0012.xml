Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.                          Part I. The Problem. General Considerations.   1. THIS paper has been prepared as an accompaniment to the Interim Report of the Inter-Departmental Committee  on Economic Assistance for  Central  and South-Eastern Europe, of which a copy  is annexed.  It sets out to examine the implications,  in  the political sphere,  of the Anschluss and the results of the recent Czechoslovak crisis, and to suggest what action we can now take which, while contributing  materially towards the promotion of our political influence in South-Eastern Europe^) by economic measures,  will at the same time be in consonance with  the main  lines of our foreign policy and in particular of our policy towards Germany.  2. A  paper prepared for the Cabinet last May (CP. 127 (38)), recommending the setting up of the Inter-Departmental Committee, of which the Interim Report is attached, summarised the more important results of German  domination in Central  and  South-Eastern  Europe.  At  that  time the Anschluss  alone  had taken place.   Since then large districts in Czechoslovakia containing a consider- able and varied range of industries have  been incorporated in the Reich, so that the results foreshadowed in the  Cabinet  paper are even more likely to-day than they were in May last.  The probable  results were then described as follows :-   3. A  considerable increase of German cultural influence; a strengthening of Germany&apos;s potential reservoir of raw materials, particularly food-stuffs, minerals and  oils; an extension of markets for  her manufactured goods; the domination by Germany of the communications system in Central and South-Eastern Europe, including, particularly, the Danube,  when through  traffic from Hamburg to the Black Sea has been  made possible by the  completion of the Rhine-Main-Danube Canal; and, finally, a general accretion of strength  and prestige and the virtual certainty, that in the event of war some, if  not all, of these countries would directly or indirectly come to Germany&apos;s assistance.  The memorandum went on to point out that, given the  geographical position of  Greater Germany and the economic   (&apos;) The countries considered in this paper are Bulgaria,  Greece, Hungary, Roumania and yugoslavia, i.e., the same as those considered in the Interim Report.   Czechoslovakia has been excluded.      10124   &quot;[.18188]                                               n
framework of Central Europe, some of these results were, in any case, inevitable;a  proportion  of  them could  not  be  prevented whatever action His  Majesty&apos;s.Government and the French Government might be prepared to take, short of war.It might have been added that not only were some of these results inevitable butthat they were alSo natural, and, economically at least, might be of benefit to thecountries concerned.   4. Germany has now 80 million inhabitants, and it is natural  that she should increase her trade.   Central and South-Eastern Europe clearly provides the  most convenient direction, mainly for geographical reasons; but there are other con-siderations as well.  History shows that  for many years the general and culturalbackgrounds to the  aspirations  of most of these backward countries have  beeneither  Germanic or  Slav.  The Latin culture, fashionable in  some higher social and intellectual circles, has been a rather artificitil veneer,  whether acquired inParis or in Rome, j Trade between industrial Germany and predominantly agricul-tural Central and South-Eastern Europe is complementary and therefore mutuallybeneficial.  Moreover, the economic task of modern  Germany in relation to the danubian countries was pointed out by the economist List nearly a hundred yearsago. Up to this point all are probably agreed.  Where opinions differ is as to thepoint where the line should  be drawn,  i.e., the degree  to which  these countries can afford to grant Germany an economic monopoly, and thus the degree to which german influence, economic and political, should be allowed to predominate.  5. In the Cabinet memorandum quoted above it was stated that:  &quot;It has alwaysbeen the traditional policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government to prevent  one Powerattaining a predominant position on the Continent.  It  is  true  that conditionschange and that England  no longer  stands in exactly  the same  relationship to europe as  she did either  in  the 18th or 19th centuries.  Nevertheless, it  will no doubt be generally conceded that it remains very much to her interest indeed,it will be argued in some quarters  that it is vital to her interests that germany should not attain a virtual hegemony in Europe.  It is, perhaps, all the moreimportant to avoid this  since it seems not impossible that the Western powers will eventually be ready to concede to Germany in  one form or another somecolonial territory.  In other words, we may look forward to a time when germany will once again be a colonial Power, in wdiich case her  predominance in europe would  be even more  dangerous to us than if she were still to be deprived of anycolonial territory.&quot;  The view was therefore reached that an effort on the  partof His  Majesty&apos;s Government to counteract Germany&apos;s advance seemed highly desirable, if, indeed, it was  not considered vital to our  interest.  At the sametime the memorandum went on to point out our object  &quot; is not  and  should nothave the appearance of being designed to create an anti-German bloc.  Such a bloccould in reality only be organised if this country, and perhaps France, were readyto grant military  guarantees, which clearly they are  not.  Our object shouldrather be to endeavour to ensure that this area of Europe shall look  specificallyfor leadership to this country and generally towards the Western Powers  ratherthan feel obliged,  in default  of any other point d&apos;appui, to allow itself to be exploited by Berlin.&quot;  It may be argued that recent events in Central Europehave rendered this  object Utopian; that owing to Germany&apos;&apos;S latest  success wecan no longer hope that the areas in question &apos;&apos; shall look specifically for leadershipto this  country.&quot;  But whatever view is taken, there will, no doubt, be generalagreement  that these countries  should be actively encouraged to realise that apossible point d&apos;appui other  than Berlin does  exist, and that  British interestin them, both  political or economic, will  be maintained  and developed.  Such an object  is a moderate and reasonable  one, but the counterpart, which should be clearly recognised, is that we must be ready, notwithstanding our efforts to safe-guard  this object, to permit  Germany  to obtain all she materially requires intthese ci rests  indeed, we cannot very well prevent her from doing so.  6. It may be pertinent very briefly to  recall here the arguments in&apos;support ofthis general view :      Is  it in fact  possible for us to stop Germany  from realising the greaterpart of her ambitions in this area?  What means do  we dispose of to do so?They may be  divided into two classes :      (a) Power politics, i.e., alliances, military conventions, close understandings,           &amp;c, &amp;o, which necessarily involve, and are  often based upon, large           scale armaments credits and agreements.  This is a possible policy but           it  almost certainly leads directly to war, will be  unpopular in this           country and is uncertain in its operation.  For in point of fact what
          countries can we be certain of attaching to ourselves by such methods ?          We have great hopes of Turkey, and Greece is now our main objective          (though whether or not we achieve our object of securing Greece on          our  side must mainly  depend on whether  we adopt the measures          suggested later in this memorandum).   We  could  not&apos;be certain of          Roumania, still less of  Bulgaria;  Hungary is becoming less  and less          of a free agent, and unless we are sure of Italy, we have no hope of          making certain of Yugoslavia; but for  reasons which  are given later          in this paper it would be unwise to place undue  reliance on Italy.          The conclusion must be that of all these countries Turkey alone justifies          any real expectations; but that we may hope to  add Greece if certain          measures, are  adopted.    (b)  By the use of our exceptional financial and economic  power and of our          consuming capacity. We can, if we are prepared to use methods which          hitherto have been regarded as unorthodox (cf. the recommendations          of the Interim Report), strengthen our political influence in at least          some, of these countries  by the judicious encouragement of  trade,          industry and capital investment.  7.  Of these  two methods it will no doubt be generally  agreed that we mustchoose the second.   There are, however, great difficulties in the way of theexercise of our powers under (b) and  these difficulties are cogently set out in the interim Report;  attention need, therefore, only be  drawn here  to  one  aspect of the need  to  increase  imports from these countries, viz. that any action  thatis possible in this sphere must be of such a character  as  not to jeopardise the goodwill of  &quot;the Dominions,  which is essential to the continued existence in itspresent  form of the Empire.  8.  These considerations suggest strongly that we are not in a position to preventGermany realising the greater part of her ambitions and that it would, therefore,be folly to enter into an unequal race.  If, however, we pursue a limited objectivethere seems  no reason why, within those limits, we should not succeed.Non-encirclement of Germany.  9.  It  will have been noted  that in the quotation given above from the cabinet paper of last May it was stated that  our object &quot; is not, and should not have theappearance  of  being, designed to create an anti-German bloc&quot; and it is this qualification or rider to our political objective which has perhaps assumed thegreatest importance as a result of the events of the last few weeks.   It is pertinentto recall that in a conversation with Herr  Hitler on  the 30th  September thePrime Minister raised the question of the relations between Germany and South-Eastern Europe.  Mr. Chamberlain said that he had read expressions of Germanopinion indicating a suspicion that England  desired not a military but  aneconomic  encirclement of Germany.   This was  a suspicion  which, the  PrimeMinister went on, if entertained,  was without foundation.  He did,  however,desire to see  an improvement  in  international  trade.   The  events of  the29th September would certainly have eased  the political tension  but something more positive  was required in the economic sphere,  and he would  particularlyhave liked to  see a relaxation of  the restrictions on international trade which now existed.  Had the Eiihrer, Mr. Chamberlain asked, any suggestions to make on this subject ?  Herr Hitler replied that in South-Eastern Europe german relations were  economic but that  there were no political  ties.   He went on tosay that economic relations  were quite natural because Germany was  a greatproducer of industrial articles and a large consumer  of raw materials and food-stuffs.   The Balkan States  were the other  way round; they  produced primary products and consumed industrial articles.   10. This conversation is recalled in order to show that we have informed herr hitler Very recently that we have no intention of encircling Germany economically,and  to  show too that  Herr  Hitler regards  his relations  with the countries inquestion as  of  an economic  character.  It is, however, worth  remarking that he  ,spoke of present relations and not of future aims and intentions.   11. If, therefore, we continue to consider the principle enunciated last May asvalid, it seems clear that any measures we may have in mind to promote the economicwelfare of these countries must be examined  in the light of two conditions :  first,whether they are likely  to influence the country in question in the  direction of      [18188]                                                    b 2
looking for leadership to this country and the &quot;West rather than to  Germany;and, secondly,  whether they are likely to be considered by  Germany as con-stituting  part of,  or  contributing  towards,  a  policy  of encirclement, eithereconomic or military.A alternative Policy.  12.  There is, however, another point of view and this paper would not be completeunless mention had been made of it.  Until the recent  incorporation by germany of  the  Sudeten districts,  Czechoslovakia  was a  barrier both politically and economically to German progress  in the Danube  area.   That barrier has nowcollapsed and it is held in many quarters that  the way is now open to  a develop-ment which should be economically advantageous for the  world at large, althoughit  is  admitted that the political  implications may be  alarming.  Those whohold  this view suggest  that the  development of  Central  and  South-eastern europe, mainly by German enterprise and organisation, should not be discouraged,since  it  is  intrinsically  desirable that these  backward regions  should attaina higher standard of living and one more nearly approximating to  that obtainingin  Western Europe.   This task,  in their  view,  is overdue  and  Germany  is undoubtedly the one Power which is in a position to undertake it successfully.Far-reaching developments in these  countries, they argue, will not only be  ofadvantage to the countries themselves but also to the world outside, which will eventually  share in the  increased prosperity  thus engendered.   From  this  itwould follow that an alternative to the methods suggested in the Interim  report would be  for this  country  to  assist Germany in developing the  countries  ofSouth-Eastern  Europe, by  financial  support if required  and especially  in theform of providing  raw materials on credit.   Nor is there anything revolutionaryin this conception  of Central European trade.  The economic alliance between germany  and  the Austro-Hungarian  Empire  (i.e.,  Austria, Czechoslovakia,Hungary and large parts  of Yugoslavia and Roumania) &quot;was as  close  as thepolitical  alliance;  and short-term  money regularly supplied  by London  playedan important part in this trade.  13.  Other things being equal, a  renewal  of  this system might,  indeed, be thebest way to promote British economic influence,  and,  to some extent, Britishexport trade both with Germany herself and also with the  South-Eastern european countries who,  as their standard of  living  improved, would require more goodsboth  German and  British.  Such a policy would not imply the withdrawalof  Great  Britain  from these markets, though it would probably result in aproportional increase of exports from Germany much  greater than  from theUnited  Kingdom;  nor would  it  imply the  abandonment  of those  proposals put forward in the Interim Report  which  have  a genuine economic foundation(such  as the improvement  of our  trade with  Greece by increased purchases  of tobacco); but it would mean the abandonment of a policy that might be interpreted as being deliberately obstructive to  Germany,  e.g., a policy of granting  creditson  a frankly non-commercial basis or of direct Government purchases of whichthe result would be a diversion of trade from Germany to this country.  14.  These arguments, which have much to recommend them  from the point  ofview of common-sense economics, depend largely for their validity on the assump-tion that, in fact,  the  economic domination of these countries by Germany willnot only increase their prosperity and raise their standard of living, but willalso make  Germany herself more  prosperous  and thus, in &quot;the long run, be  toour advantage and the advantage of  world trade generally.  For if  Germanybecomes more prosperous she should become  a  better customer  of the  UnitedKingdom.   These  arguments, however, assume that the  trade between Germanyand the  South-Eastern European  countries will be of  an orthodox,  liberal  orfree trade character, based on  the free exchange of goods and payment  by freeexchange.   But this has not been  the case  in  the past and is  unlikely to be thecase in the  future, unless,  as is just possible,  there is a fundamental change inGermany&apos;s economic and financial policy.  It  seems, at  present, far more likely that any economic dominance that Germany may attain in these countries will result in their economic vassalage to Germany  and to German  economic doctrine,and that German  foreign exchange  restrictions and autarchic aims will becomefactors conditioning and moulding the economic life of each of them.  This, in
fact, seems certain so long as Germany refuses to envisage the depreciation ofthe mark and to relax her exchange controls, and so long  as she insists thatthese countries shall receive payment for their exports in German goods, wantedor unwanted.  Moreover^ the short-term  credits by  London  to  Germany, bothbefore  and since the war, have been frozen and have proved a source&apos;of greatembarrassment and, indeed,  of  danger to the international  credit of London.We could not afford to lock up further resources in Germany,  so. long as shemaintains a system of exchange control; nor to advance funds to the  Danubiancountries  so long  as their trade with Germany only produces  blocked  marks.While, therefore, Germany, for one  reason or  another, is  unwilling to  lift herexchange  controls, the arguments  in  favour of permitting her a  free hand inthese countries would  seem largely to fall to the ground.  It appears, indeed,as though no real progress could be made in economic conditions in Europe untilexchange  control is  relaxed (a truth which has often been put forward in thepast), and that meanwhile  any increase in the economic predominance exercised by Germany in  the countries in question  will not redound  in any way to thebenefit of world trade in general  or of British trade in particular.  15.  This does  not mean,  however, that there may not be some possibilities ofco-operation between German and British endeavours in  these  areas.               General Political and  Strategic  Considerations.Special Position of Greece.  16.  It will be useful to turn now to the general political and strategic considera-tions involved (so far  as I am competent  to discuss  these latter  aspects of theproblem).   Greece,  as  is pointed out in paragraph  13 of the Interim  Report,occupies  a special position  since she is  not  only  a South-Eastern  european power,1 but also and she is unique in this respect among the  group of countries under  examination- a Mediterranean Power.(2)   Greece must  therefore  beconsidered from the point of view of our general policy in the Mediterranean andthe Near East.  In 1936 the Chiefs of Staff were not  disposed to consider a closeunderstanding with Greece a necessity for purely strategic reasons, and  the newposition which has  arisen  as a result of the Anschluss and the absorption  byGermany of the  Sudeten districts has not yet been submitted to them.  If it were,no doubt the Chiefs of Staff would wish to have before them, in order to examine this question with profit, the probable state of our relations with both Italy andGermany.  It is, however,  only too probable that the German attitude  towardsHis Majesty&apos;s Government will, partly at least,  depend on the policy  we nowadopt  in  Central and South-Eastern  Europe, of which  Greece  forms  a part;while the policy  we adopt towards Greece may well influence not only the  attitudeof other countries  in  South-Eastern  Europe  towards us,  but also, and this ismore  important, the attitude of Turkey  (to whom  Greece  is  allied), and theviews of Egypt and of the Eastern Mediterranean basin generally.  If  we permitGreece to pass into the German orbit, the political  effect  in  those regions maybe disastrous,  while the strategic effects can scarcely be negligible.  Meanwhile,as pointed out in the Interim Report, we are in a better position to defend Greecethan we are the other countries under  consideration.  In these circumstances it might be in the nature of putting the cart before the horse to submit thisquestion in its present embryonic  stage to the Chiefs of Staff; or, to put it in another way,  it may well be that strategic considerations in themselves shouldnot be the sole criterion of  our attitude towards Greece.Effect  on Italy of Economic Domination by Germany.  17.  Leaving Greece, therefore, on one side, we are faced with the  remainingcountries^ namely, Hungary,  Roumania, Yugoslavia and Bulgaria.  A germany which has swallowed  these  four  countries economically,  and which thereforedominates them  politically, is bound, as we have seen, to obtain a great accretionof strength and power.  What will be the effect of these developments upon Italy ?We hope that by bringing the Anglo-Italian Agreement in force we may be ableto restore that element of  sincere friendliness to Anglo-Italian  relations whichcharacterised  them in the  pre-sanctions  period.   We may well succeed  up to apoint,  but there  is a fundamental difference between the position to-day and thatobtaining in 1935.   In the interval we have permitted the Rome-Berlin axis to                (2) Yugoslavia is an Adriatic, not a Mediterranean Power.
be forged against us, and Germany has, as a result of the Anschluss, a common frontier with Italy on the Brenner.  Italy has therefore to choose between herhopes and her fears of Germany,Italian Hopes.  18. Hitherto the  axis has functioned very greatly  to the benefit of Germany.Nor can it be said up to the present to have worked to the detriment of Italy.  Itseems probable that the Italians will assess the value of that axis in terms of thebenefits it may be expected to confer on them, and they will, of course, assess theAnglo-Italian Agreement from the same angle.  When, however, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment have recognised the Italian Empire in Abyssinia, and have settledtheir frontier questions in Africa to the mutual satisfaction of both countries,what can the British  Empire offer to Italy comparable to the promises which theGermans may make to them ?   While a friendly Britain can offer Italy securityof communication with  her  overseas  possessions and  freedom  to develop  herexisting resources without threat of interference, the Germans may well hold outprospects  of  an Italian Empire  in North  Africa and  territory   stretchingcontinuously  from the Mediterranean to the Indian Ocean.   They can, however,only do so at  the expense either of a trial of strength with the British Empire or as the result  of  such  a decline of British power and  prestige as would producesuch a development without a struggle an unlikely contingency.  In short, Italy&apos;shopes of Germany are based on aggrandisement at the risk of a conflict with theBritish Empire; she can only look to  us for a security in  which to develop whatshe has already  acquired.  Moreover, we must remember that those in power in italy in  the  next ten to fifteen years will not be statesmen distinguished  byjudgment and a  sense of balance, but will probably  be either Signor Mussolinihimself (whose judgment is not what it was),  or young Fascists who have beentaught to believe in an early revival of the ancient Roman Empire.  The possibility that the coming generation in Italy will therefore choose the path of risk andadventure cannot be  lightly dismissed.   The accretion of strength to Germany,which will result from the virtual absorption (except territorially) of these fivecountries, will be marked, and may well reinforce the Italians in their view thatthey will be right to choose Berlin rather than London. Germany can also exertgreat economic influence on Italy, especially in virtue of her future control ofthe Danube and as  a result of the pressure she can-bring to bear on  Trieste; inthis respect the Italian  position does not differ very greatly  from  that of the danubian countries themselves.  She,  too, now is within the German orbit.Italian Fears.  19. So soon as the Anglo-Italian Agreement is in  force Italian  fears of thiscountry should be largely discounted.  On  the other hand, Italy will  continue tobe  frightened of  Germany  and  for the  following reasons: The  common frontier  on  the  Brenner places the  Italian  industrial  regions in  Lombardyat  the . mercy of  German  air attack,  and  enables  Germany  to  dominatethe  South   Tyrol   (a  German  minority)  and  to  threaten Trieste.   Itis true that   Herr  Hitler has  recently affirmed that this  frontier  is sacred,but  suspicions are bound to breed in the  minds of  the Italian people, who inany case,  and especially in  the north,  dislike the German  connexion.   Thereis the further threat to Italian influence in South-Eastern Europe represented: byGermany&apos;s advance in those regions.  In  the recent  past Italy was  attempting to extend that influence  through the medium of the  Rome  Protocols  (signed by italy,  Austria and Hungary).  20. These purely political factors will no doubt outweigh all other considerations in the shaping of Italian policy; but so far as economic and financial considera-tions come into the account, they operate in favour of a rapprochement between italy and the Western Powers.   Italy is  a far poorer country than Germanyand since  the acquisition of her empire the Italian Government have undoubtedlyhad constant  preoccupation as to their  financial  position.   The drain  on their foreign exchange resources constituted  by the demands for  the conquest  anddevelopment  of  Ethiopia has necessitated a rationing of imports of the mostrigid  character,  but  even so they have not yet succeeded in balancing  theirpayments on  international account.  If they could  obtain development capital for their hew Empire it would ease the internal situation, but such  capital canbe  looked for only from the Western Powers.  At  present,  however, there is
little  prospect  that any of the Western Powers  would be prepared to investcapital in the Italian Empire and there is not, therefore, such a definite prospectof assistance on this head as would counter-balance other considerations.  21.  It may be that Italian fears of Germany will outweigh Italian ho/pes fromthe same  quarter, and, Tf so,  this will perhaps be  mainly due to  the Duce&apos;sinability to drive his people, against their wishes and  better  judgment, beyond certain point. But it will scarcely assist the Italians to make their choice ontlhe basis of fear: rather than hopes  if Germany is permitted to dominate South-Eastern Europe.  In such circumstances Italy  might  well feel  that she must look for compensation elsewhere and that in the meanwhile the Western powers were  disinteresting themselves in Europe.  That Italy herself is not anxious for German  dominance in South-Eastern Europe appears to be shown by herrecent policy in regard to the eastern districts of Czechoslovakia, where she seemsto have been working for a common  Polish-Hungarian frontier as a  barrier,possibly against Bolshevist influence, but more probably against further Germanpenetration.Reports of Italo-German Agreement over South-Eastern Europe.  22.  It  must  be  added  that rumours have recently  reached us,  at  presentunconfirmed, to the effect  that  the Italian  and German  Governments havetogether reached agreement as to their future spheres  of economic influence  inSouth-Eastern  Europe.  It is suggested that under  this arrangement Hungary,Bulgaria and Turkey are assigned to Germany, while Yugoslavia, Greece and roumania  are  to&quot; come  within the  Italian orbit.  Other accounts transpose the comparative  positions of Hungary  and  Yugoslavia, the other two countries  ineach case remaining the same.  There is nothing inherently improbable in these reports,- though on balance it  seems  unlikely that Germany  would, in presentcircumstances,  be prepared to concede quite so much to Italy.  If she does so itmight perhaps be  regarded as an indication that her eyes are, in  reality, fixedsteadily on the Ukraine.  In  the absence of confirmation of these reports it isdifficult to  take them into serious  account in  reaching conclusions  as  to theattitude His Majesty&apos;s Government should themselves adopt.  If they were true,however, it would suggest  that the Rome-Berlin axis is functioning even more to the mutual  satisfaction  of the  two  partners than  we had supposed.   Theresults,  however, of Italian economic  penetration in  three of these countriessupported as it would be by Germany (always assuming that the  Germans held to their part of the bargain) would possibly be less detrimental to British intereststhan would German domination in  all six of them.  It seems unlikely that italy would, in fact,  be in a position to take a very  large proportion of the exportsof these countries (except possibly  timber and minerals from Yugoslavia, meat from  Yugoslavia and Hungary, and oil  from  Roumania) since she is herself an agricultural  producer on  a large scale,  and since as an import market she  isof secondary importance.  Nevertheless it seems  certain that if such an arrange-ment  has been  reached between Italy and  Germany, and if Italy was unableto make  full use of the opportunities  afforded  her,  Germany would not standidly by and see those missed opportunities exploited by third parties, but wouldherself make use of them.  In practice the arrangement would perhaps work out more  on  the lines of an unwritten agreement between Italy  and Germany  to divide the  three countries allotted to Italy between themselves; and in any case,it should probably be regarded as an indication on general lines rather than as ahard and fast agreement to limit and abide by strictly defined spheres of influence;Summary of Argvments.  23.  The results of the arguments so far developed may be resumed as follows :-    (1)  While  on  general  grounds an effort  to  counteract German dominance           in these regions is desirable, lest Germany become  paramount  in           Europe, such dominance,  however, is  a  natural  tendency,  and any           effort to prevent it is probably futile.    (2)  But  an effort to modify its effects,  especially in certain  countries, may           be practicable and advantageous.    (3)  Such an effort should not constitute, and should not have the appearance           of constituting, an anti-German bloc.
    (4)  It  should be based on commercial rather than political methods  (which           in effect mean power politics).    (5)  The alternative policy of assisting  Germany to develop these regions           is nojt feasible, at any rate so long as the present. German  economic           and financial system is maintained.    (6)  Greece is a special case and demands special and urgent treatment.    (7)  The general political situation, and in particular the equivocal position           of Italy, reinforces  the view that if we can do anything to promote           our influence in these countries, we should not hesitate to do it.    There  remains to be considered the practical application of these principlesin the light of the Committee&apos;s Report:                         Part II. Recommendations.General.  24. In any review of the problem it should be remembered that German influenceis more strongly marked in some countries than in others, and that while certain measures  would be sufficient  to stem the  tide in country A, they would be ofno  use  in country  B.   On the other hand, it  may  be  necessary to contemplatemeasures  in certain  circumstances  simply on account of the delaying action they may be expected to have.  Again, as regards a possible charge by germany of  attempted encirclement  measures which  might  be  considered as part  andparcel of such a policy in  one country  would not  necessarily be considered inthis light in another.   This, again, depends on the conditions existing in each particular country.General Recommendations.  25. Paragraphs 30 to 38 of the Interim Report contain suggestions in regard toour  future  commercial policy in South-Eastern  Europe.   The comparativeadvantages  and disadvantages of the  courses  suggested under (a), (&amp;), (c) and (d)appear  to be a matter primarily for economic experts, but it is quite clear,  and paragraph 4 of the Committee&apos;s Report emphasises the point, that  &quot;the  realsolution is to be found in an increase of  normal trade.&quot;  Such an  increase, how-ever, naturally involves a modification of  tariffs, quotas and preferences where these either obstruct or restrict United  Kingdom imports from these countries.Any proposals designed to modify these restrictions  are bound to meet with veryconsiderable difficulties, and if this policy proves impracticable we should, in myopinion, consider whether we could not encourage private business interests to setup the necessary organisation to foster trade with South-Eastern Europe on thesame lines as Germany, i.e., by purchasing their products at high prices and byselling  to them in  return  United Kingdom goods  at  equally high  prices  (seeparagraph 34 of Interim Report).  I realise that to do  so will probably involveHis Majesty&apos;s  Government  in the  necessity  of guaranteeing the  interests con-cerned against financial loss, or at least of sharing part of the risk by putting up some postponed capital, but it is clear  that whatever proposals  we  adopt are bound to involve substantial expenditure.  26. With regard to paragraph 38  of  the Report, I am  strongly in favour of modifying or expanding the existing machinery of the Export Guarantees Act topermit of minor credits being  granted in respect of munitions of war, or at least of amending the existing definition of munitions of war in order to give this term a narrower  interpretation.   A decision on this question, which is, I understand,already under active  examination by the Departments concerned,  should, in myopinion, be  expedited. i, 27. At  the same time I  would wish to draw attention to the  analogous butseparate question of providing credits for material other than munitions of  war on other than a commercial basis with political objects in view (cf. paragraphs 36and 37  of the Interim Report).  To be in a position  to grant credits of this kind would be  of great advantage to His Majesty&apos;s Government  in pursuance of thepolicy in South-Eastern Europe suggested in  this paper.  28. In these circumstances I would  suggest that serious and early consideration should be given to the setting up of an organisation  parallel  to but distinct fromthe Export  Credits Guarantee Department, whose duty it would be to consider,grant and administer credits to foreign countries covering both munitions of war
 and ordinary civilian requirements on other than a commercial basis with political bbjeets in mind.   I am not suggesting that we should at once proceed to give credits to these countries with the sole purpose of opposing  German progress; but 1  consider that it is essential to have such powers in case of need.   If such an organisation were set-up it would clearly be desirable  that the grant of such hon-cqmmercial credits should go hand in hand with an attempt to obtain better treatment for existing debts  to the&quot; United Kingdom owing by the countries in question.                           .&apos;&apos;&quot;:,&apos;V  &quot;    &apos;. &quot; &quot;   29:  I am also in favour of the course suggested in paragraph 35 of the Report. namely,  that we  should persuade  the  principal  companies concerned  in this country to buy more oil, wheat and especially tobacco from these countries.   30.  My general recommendations can therefore be summarised as follows :-  -     (a) that an attempt be made to increase our normal trade with these countries  -&apos;a f      by modifying such tariffs, quotas and preferences as restrict United           Kingdom  imports  from  these  countries.    Should  this  prove           impracticable  I  recommend  that  private  business  interests be   ^  &apos;     encouraged, with the  assistance of His Majesty&apos;s Government, to set           up an  organisation to foster trade with South-Eastern Europe on the           same lines as Germany, and that instructions  to this end  be  given at           once to the Departments concerned, namely, the Treasury and Board           of Trade.     (b) that  a decision should be expedited  on the  question of  modifying or           expanding the existing machinery of the Export Guarantees Act, and           early. consideration given at the same  time to  the setting up of an           organisation separate from but parallel to the E.C.G.D. dealing with &quot;          credits on a non-commercial basis with political objects in view.     (c) that  the  principal companies  concerned  in  this country  should be           persuaded to increase their purchases of such commodities as oil, wheat ;  :     -   and tobacco from the areas in question. The Question of informing  the  German and French  Governments  of our     Intentions in South-Eastern Europe.   31.  It may be considered that the four-Power Munich Agreement of the 29th September and the two-Power declaration signed at Munich on the 30th September should be the starting point of a new phase in Anglo-German relations and that this phase should, if possible, be characterised by increased trust and confidence on both sides.  There is much to be said for this view since our object admittedly is to get  on  friendly terms with the Germans, and, in general,  frankness  pays between  actual or prospective friends.  The Germans are, however,  by nature and as a  result of recent experience suspicious, and it may be very difficult to dispel  their mistrust. Nevertheless it is for consideration whether we should not take an opportunity of raising this subject, on the basis that the improvement of the economic situation in these countries is of common interest both to Germany and to ourselves  and that we should be glad to discuss with them whether it is possible for us to collaborate in  this field.  It would be natural  to discuss the question of trade  in South-Eastern Europe in connexion with any wider discus- sions we  may have with  the German Government  on  the subject  of  general economic  appeasement in Europe.   32.  It is unlikely, however, that such discussions will materialise in the imme- diate future.  Meanwhile, the urgency of economic action on our part remains.  Ifsuch action provokes expressions of German resentment, there would, in my opinion, be every reason for explaining to them our policy and the motives which underlie it.  It would not  be necessary to do so in great detail, but the outline of our proposals in  each  country might be explained to them orally and confidentially. We might ,stress, firstly, that  our main objects are (a) to maintain and develop-our trade in those areas, and (b) to assist the natural  desire of the countriesin question to obtain free exchange wherewith to maintain their own domesticindustries; and secondly that it is no part of our policy to attempt an economicencirclement  of Germany.   Such  a notification might be appropriately referred back to the Prime Minister&apos;s conversation of the 30th September with Herr Hitler (see paragraph 9  above).    In return we might demand  from the Germans an equal frankness and ask that  they should inform us of any large-scale economicoperations they have in mind  to undertake in the countries in  question.  While       [18188]                                                      c
this request: might not meet with any marked response, it might in  any case be useful to make it and might be  based on our general interest in the revival of world trade and the raising of the standard of living in these countries.  33.  Meanwhile, I  would recommend that in any case we  should  inform theFrench Government confidentially of our general policy in Sduth-Eastern europe and give them an outline of the action we are taking, or proposing to take, ineach particular country;    I rpass now to detailed recommendations in regard to each of the countries concerned.     o                  -   .Greece.  34.  Greece has an extensive seaboard on the Mediterranean,  and the freedomof that sea is as essential to her as it is to Italy or ourselves.   Moreover, we and France are the only Powers who can prevent the domination of the Mediter-ranean by Italy, the country of whom Greece is perhaps most suspicious; althoughGermany runs a strong second.  In these circumstances  it is  not surprising that Greece should look to us for assistance and should express her anxiety toshape  her  policy in consonance with  our own.  35.  Our  own position as a Mediterranean Power  makes it essential that weshould not refuse this assistance, and we have to consider whether our object willbest be achieved by either (a) economic help,  (b) intermediate, or politico-economic,measures, or (c) political measures.   The choice is wider in  the case of Greecethan in that of other countries, since our need to render  assistance to Greeceis greater  and more urgent, and we should be prepared, therefore,  to  envisagemeasures in this case which  we might not  in  others; moreover,  the Greekshave  themselves  suggested measures under  all these heads.  The Greek PrimeMinister has, for instance, recently and officially offered His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment  a/full-blown alliance.(3)  As pointed  out in paragraphs 13 to 17 of  the interim Report,  the key to the  problem  seems undoubtedly  to be found in thepurchase of  Greek tobacco, and this fact  has recently been recognised in cbn-versation by General Metaxas himself. It is also to be preferred on  the grounds of a possible accusation of encirclement by  Germany, since clearly any politicalmeasure such as an alliance, or a guarantee of Greece&apos;s maritime frontiers againstunprovoked aggression or a consultative pact  would be objectionable  from theGerman and, it must be added, from the Italian point of view.  Nor,  I assume,would His Majesty&apos;s Government be anxious to increase their  political commit-ments if they could achieve their object by different and less drastic means.  36. Nevertheless, the purchase of  additional quantities of tobacco would notalone be sufficient.  The  500,000 worth suggested in the Interim Report would,however, be  sufficient  if combined with other measures. The other measures  Iwould recommend would be :    ., ,(i) Such action as is possible to meet  the Greek  request for big guns and           fortifications for coastal  defence  purposes, anti-aircraft  guns and      1 V   equipment  for their  air force.    (ii) The  grant to  Greece  of  such financial  assistance  for  development           purposes as may be  possible on the lines suggested in paragraph 37           of the Committee&apos;s report.  To  this end I would recommend that the        ....  E.Q.G.D. should be  authorised  to start negotiations with the Greek           Government on the understanding that sanction will, in  any case, be         :  forthcoming for a modest credit, even if it is on a somewhat speculative        ,&apos;.  basis.   37.  From such preliminary and unofficial  enquiries as have been made it seems doubtful to what extent we shall be able in the near future, owing to the require-ments of our own programme and those of the Dominions and of our allies  (Iraq,Egypt  and Portugal), to meet the. Greek demands&apos; under (i).  If, however, we donot do so it seems certain that  the Germans will, since the Germans, with theirenormous military equipment, have at all times a large surplus of almost up-to-    (?)vSueh..an alliance  would,, inter, alia require. His Majesty&apos;s / Government&apos; to: guarantee Greece&apos;s present frontiers.  So long as Bulgaria&apos;s demands for an access to the  -aegean  remain unsatisfied and any doubts subsist  as to Italy&apos;s  peaceful, intentions,  this would  be a most dangerous commitment. &quot;&apos;                                                  .
date arms, which they are willing: to part with on terms very favourable to thepurchasers.  We have no similar surpluses; it is, however, most desirable that weshould make a real effort.  We could, it seems, do something towards meeting theGreek wishes (a), by way of the provision of technical assistance.(air/advisersJandfurther naval advisers inJGreece, and the training of Greek naval:and :a-ir officersin this country), but the bulk of the cost must probably be bornefey HissMajesty&apos;sGovernment; and (b) by the supply of temporary and stopgap material for coastaldefence purposes, &amp;c. (e.g.,  second-hand, and cast-off  guns-of our  own),: but  this material would have to be provided with the least possible delay and as a free giftOr for a nominal sum.  Later, more  permanent material for coastal  defence,together with anti-aircraft guns and air force equipment,  should be made.avail-able, but would have to be supplied  on long-term credit.  It is realised, and theprospect must  be squarely faced,  that the provision of this latter  will involvespecial legislation unless the machinery of the Exports Guarantee Act is amended to permit of credits being granted in respect  of munitions of war.  38. Finally, I must add that the purchase of Greek tobacco is of such paramount importance  that if we fail to reach our objective in this direction,  the subsidiaryrecommendations as they  stand would not suffice.  At the same  time, I would emphasise that unless we are  prepared to take some measures to  meet Greekdemands for assistance in the sphere of her defensive armaments,  in addition to increased purchases of Greek  tobacco, we  shall  almost certainly be  met with further demands of a political nature from that country.  Of the three mentionedin paragraph  35 above,  a  consultative pact which would include among itssignatories  Greece,  Turkey, France, and, if possible,  Italy, would  be  the least objectionable, but it would  be  far preferable, for reasons which lie outside thescope of this paper, that even this  measure should not be contemplated unlessabsolutely necessary.   Meanwhile,  His Majesty&apos;s  Government have in view  apossible invitation to the King of Greece to pay a State visit to this country nextautumn, and though this  may be expected, on general grounds, to have a usefuleffect, it might prove a disappointment if it is  not preceded or accompanied bydefinite arrangements for  economic assistance to Greece.  39. To resume, therefore,  it is recommended that:      (a) The Prime Minister should be authorised, on behalf of the Cabinet, to           bring pressure to bear on the tobacco interests in this country in order           to induce  them  to  take  at least  500,000 worth of  Greek tobacco           annually.(-1)     (b) We should  do  our best to meet Greek requests for assistance to improve           her  defensive armaments.  Such assistance should include material            which will have to be provided in the first instance as a gift or for. a           nominal sum, and, later, on long credit terms.  To this end the Service           and Supply Departments should promptly examine what can be done           and submit a report within six weeks.     (c)  We should  grant to Greece such financial assistance  for  development           purposes as may be possible on the lines suggested in paragraph 37           of the Committee&apos;s  Report, and the authorisation referred  to in           paragraph  36 (ii)  above  should be given  to  the Export Credits           Guarantee Department.I must warn my Colleagues that if success should not attend our efforts under (a),the problem will have to  be reconsidered and it may well be necessary for  HisMajesty&apos;s Government to seek a fresh solution, outside the economic sphere, whichwill almost  inevitably involve new commitments of a political character.Rotimania.  40. If Roumania, partly as the result of her reliance on the support--moral and otherwise of this country,  were to have serious difficulties with Germany, andif, in these circumstances, she were to appeal to this country for assistance, our ability to bring military pressure to bear would depend entirely on our relationswith Turkey, since it would not be possible to pass a fleet through the Straits ifthis  latter Power  were hostile: and apart from naval action in the  Black Sea   (&apos;) My own efforts,  and  those of Sir P. Leith-Ross, in this  direction have not  so Jarbeen successful.      [18188]                                                      c  2
we are virtually powerless to afford military assistance to Roumania.  This factalone should perhaps make us chary of attempting too much in this country.Paragraphs 18  and  22 of the  Interim Report  give  the background to theRoumanian &quot;-problem as it presents  itself  to us to-day. . The only  observationwhich need be added to that appreciation  is that  the Anschluss and the recentincorporation of the Sudeten  districts have in general  induced in Roumania afear of Germany far stronger than a desire to draw closer to her.   It shouldalso be remembered that Roumania possesses a  German  minority of 700,000 anda Hungarian minority of  1,500,000 persons.                                 v  41. In these circumstances, and bearing in mind paragraph 22 of  the Interim1Report, the following measures  are recommended  in Roumania :      (a) The regular purchase of certain minimum quantities of oil and wheat           (if necessary for resale) by the big British combines;  for this purpose           the various Departments concerned, viz., the Treasury, Board of Trade,           Food (Defence  Plans)  Department and Petroleum Department, should           be instructed to concert together in order to take the necessary action.     (b) Assistance to Roumania in the construction of a naval base on the Black           Sea.                                                         :  42. As regards (a), it is  difficult to say how far the Germans are likely to objectto purchases of wheat and oil, but our purchases are never likely to be on sucha scale as to inconvenience in any way the German Government, and this question must perhaps be considered in relation to the bigger  question of  whether qrnot we shall be wise to inform  the German  Government of our intentions ingeneral in regard to South-Eastern Europe.   This  point is dealt with earlier in this paper.  43. As regards (6), it is probably true to say  that if we do not help Roumania&apos;,to construct this  base the Germans will.  In these  circumstances  there are.arguments both for  and against  this proposal.  As against it, it may be urgedthat it would be objectionable to the Germans, and further, that  there  is noreason why His  Majesty&apos;s Government should construct a base which in thecase of war will almost inevitably fall into German hands.  Moreover, special legislation would probably be necessary to enable us to give financial assistance for this purpose since,  at present, there  seems  no basis  for a commercial credit.(If,  however,  the  recommendation  contained in paragraph  28  above  were adopted, no special legislation in  respect of this base would be required.)  It mayequally be  argued that expense incurred under  this head is of a character whichmight not  commend  itself to public opinion in  this country.  On the other hand.there seems no reason why we should deny  ourselves such  credit and influence aswe may be able to obtain by constructing this base.  Further, whatever assistance we or the  French may render her, the Germans probably regard Roumania asto all  intents  and purposes militarily at their mercy, and for this  reason it is always possible that they might not in fact  raise  objections to our proposal.The cost of the  base  would be  considerable,  perhaps in the neighbourhood of 10 million and of this sum perhaps  2 or   3 million would represent additional employment in this  country.   44. In regard to this proposal I would on the whole recommend that no decisionbe taken until  the  opportunity  afforded  by  King  CaroFs  visit enables  us  toestimate more clearly the value which the Roumanian  Government  attach, to it.I would add, however, that from our own point of view it may well prove easier to provide assistance to Roumania in the form of  a naval base than in the formof the purchase of regular quantities of Roumanian oil and wheat. Yugoslavia.   45.  The  present policy of  the Yugoslav  Government  is  to  be friends  witheveryone;  she has a common frontier with both Italy and Germany and for thisreason is unwilling, above all other countries in the Balkans, to take risks,  Circum-stances are likely to force Yugoslavia into a close understanding with Italy to resist German aggression  and  this process has already begun.  In the meantime theneed for His Majesty&apos;s Government to bestow economic  favours is  perhaps less pressing in Yugoslavia than  it is  in other parts of South-Ea,stern  Europe; nor have we  received recently any  urgent invitation  to dp..,so from the  Yugoslav Government itself.
  46. On the other hand, His Majesty&apos;s Minister in Belgrade in his latest despatchdealing with the German menace sums up his views as follows:  &quot;I can only.suggest that we continue to do everything  possible to make Yugoslavia feel thatwe  take a  friendly interest in her future;  that  we make  a  show of consulting;her on every suitable occasion in the hope that she will reciprocate our confidence;that on the principle thai every little helps  we strain every nerve  to  assistmaterially  to the limit of our powers.&quot;  As, however, it is not easy to increase our imports from Yugoslavia and as the position at present is hardly favourable to the granting of credits (see paragraph 23 of the Interim  Report), it looks as though  we  would have to trust mainly to other than commercial methods to attainour object  in this country, e.g., by showing a friendly interest in her future andby  consulting her as often as possible.  47. In these  circumstances I recommend that, although we should do our best to maintain and develop  our imports from  Yugoslavia, no special and immediate measures need to be taken in respect of that country.  We should, however, bear inmind the possibility of  granting credits  later,  particularly with reference tothe development of Yugoslavia^ mineral resources with the aid of British capital(see paragraph 23 of the Interim Report).Bulgaria.  48. Our  ability to help Bulgaria militarily is limited in  exactly the same way as it is in  the case of Roumania, viz., it depends entirely  on the goodwill ofTurke)r; and the same considerations therefore apply as are set out in the openingsentence of the section headed &quot;Roumania.&quot;  49. Further, it is clear that no assistance whatever should, be given to Bulgariauntil some help has  already been afforded to  Greece, for we have learnt fromthe  Greek Government that to do so might further endanger our position inthe  latter  country,  and  that  position is, as has already been pointed out, theone to which we must attach by far the greatest importance.  50. Meanwhile, our latest information from the Bulgarian Minister is to theeffect that  the  Germans have granted  Bulgaria credit terms  of such a character(a period  of twelve j^ears is  spoken of)  that  they can hardly refuse them; ifthese reports are true- and we have no reason to doubt  them the present efforts of the  Export Credits Guarantee Department are likely  to be vain  (see  para-graph  24  of the Interim  Report).   Our  chance, if, indeed,  it ever  existed the German credit  being secured on very large import of goods from Bulgaria(mainly tobacco), whereas any similar credit which we might grant would have no corresponding  security has probably  already been lost.  Nevertheless, I recom-mend, subject to the proviso that no assistance is given to Bulgaria until  somehelp has been  afforded to Greece, that (a) we  neglect no opportunity  that may still offer of granting credits  to Bulgaria, and (b) that in the meanwhile we do our best to develop  and increase our trade  with Bulgaria along lines which havealready been submitted to the Department concerned.Hungary.             &apos;  51. After Czechoslovakia, Hungary is the country in Central and South-eastern europe most subject at the moment to German pressure; nor should it be forgotten that she possesses a German minority of over half  a  million.  The degree towhich Hungary is and will be politically and economically dependent on germany is the subject of much speculation.  Few people  in Hungary would welcome theprospect of being ruled  from Berlin,  and  the Hungarian  industries,  which are quite considerable, are dependent on raw materials which  cannot be obtained inGermanyand for which foreign non-German trade (i.e., free &quot;Devisen&quot;)is essential.It is fairly certain that  the present Government and any moderate Governmentthat succeeded  them would  wish  to  pursue an independent policy suited to.Hungarian and not purely to German interests.  If the present Government wereoverthrown by  the  Hungarian Nazi Party, clearly Hungarian  policy wouldbecome  largely if not entirely subservient  to German dictation.  In the absenceof such a change of  Government, and we should do what we  can to prevent sucha change, it is probable  that Hungary will continue to enjoy a limited measureof freedom in her foreign policy, subject to the reserve  that It would scarcely beopen to her to  follow any course likely to arouse serious opposition in Germany,unless assured of the effective backing of Italy.
  52. There are experienced and qualified observers who hold that any economicconcession by United Kingdom to Hungary (e.g., reduction of. duty on turkeys)would have  an effect out of all proportion to its cash value; and that it wouldstimulate Hungary&apos;s will to independence, by showing that it is not ignored byHis Majesty&apos;s Government.                               t  53. In these circumstances I recommend that His Majesty&apos;s Government should do their best, short  of extraordinary measures  requiring special legislation, tomeet  the wishes of the Hungarian Government to maintain and improve their trade with this country (cf. paragraph 25 of the  Interim Eeport).  In particular,I recommend that the decision regarding the duty on turkeys be reconsidered.Conclusion.  54. It will scarcely be necessary to summarize  again the conclusions reached inthe course of this paper, since paragraph 23 resumes in skeleton the arguments ofPart  I, and Part  II itself contains a summary  of the general  recommendations(paragraph 30) and of the particular recommendations where necessary, viz., thosein the case of Greece (paragraph 39).  I would,  therefore, only  add that, in my own  opinion, it may well be essential to our ultimate security to promote our political influence by economic  measures in  South-Eastern  Europe to-day; or perhaps it would be  fairer to  say that to permit our political influence in thesecountries now to go by the board may well have, in the long run, a most serious effect upon  that security.  That is why I am so  anxious that we should do what we can now to promote that influence, particularly and above all in Greece.

ANNEX.INTERIM  REPORT OF  THE  INTER-DEPARTMENTAL COMMITTEE            ON  CENTRAL AND SOUTH-EASTERN EUROPE.    THE Committee,  which was set up in accordance  with decisions of  theCabinet Committee on Foreign Policy of the 1st and 16th June to explore  thepossibilities of promoting our political influence in South-Eastern Europe by economic measures, particularly with reference to export credit schemes, has heldfive meetings and has  examined  a number  of proposals.   It may be useful tosubmit herewith a summary report of the situation.                             General Situation.    2.  The object of the committee was not in any way to attempt the economicencirclement of  Germany.  Indeed, any such effort would have been foredoomedto failure as Germany  had established a predominant position in all the markets of South-Eastern Europe even before the Anschluss.  The trade of GreaterGermany, including Austria, represented  last year not less  than 33 per cent.of the total trade of this  group  of countries. Q   The German  Government  arenow making strenuous  efforts to intensify their trade expansion in this area, andin any case the absorption of  the Sudeten region  may be expected to increaseGermany&apos;s share of these markets.    3.  The expansion of  German trade has been due to the fact  that Germanyoffers a market  for most of the staple  products (food-stuffs and raw materials)of the countries of South-Eastern Europe, and she is  prepared to buy very largequantities at prices higher than  world prices.   She  can afford to do this as,generally speaking, she pays through her clearings in blocked marks which  canonly  be  used  for the  purchase  of certain  German  exports,  mainly  . fullymanufactured goods.  Germany has also given  very  substantial credits for  thepurchase of German manufactures to several of these countries.  These creditsare repayable over a long period  (up to ten or twelve years) out of their futureexports to Germany and Germany thus gets an option on their future production.A number of such credits have been arranged in the past, and only recently, anew credit of  12 million was agreed in principle with Turkey, while, a  credit of  35 million is said  to be under discussion with Roumania.    4.  The large purchases by Germany were.at first attractive to these countriesbecause of the higher prices offered and because they provided an outlet, for theirsurplus production.  But it is noticeable that the deeper the German economicpenetration  has  been carried the more reluctant these countries are to encourageit, and in, the past year or so most of them have been seeking to limit their exportsto Germany and to find alternative outlets.  The reason for this is partly economicand partly political.  On the one hand, the German clearing provides them inthe main with German manufactures and gives them little or  no free foreign exchange wherewith to meet their foreign debts or  to buy the raw materials which they need for their domestic industries.  On the other hand, these countries   C1) Bulgaria, Greece, Hungary,  Roumania, Yugoslavia.   In view of recent developmentsCzechoslovakia has been excluded from  consideration in this Report.
 all fear that the economic strangle-hold which Germany has established  means eventually also a political control.  For these reasons practically all the countries of South-Eastern Europe are most anxious to develop  their export trade  to the United Kingdom and several  of them have  appealed  for  credits which  would facilitate increased purchases from the United Kingdom.      5.  In f^ct, the  United Kingdom market is so essential to these countries as a means of securing free exchange that, despite all difficulties, most of them have succeeded  in  expanding  their  exports  to  the  United  Kingdom very considerably during the past three years as compared  with the pre-crisis years 1927-29;   and  (with  the exception of Greece)  they have all now a  favourable balance of trade with the United Kingdom.  But when allowance is made for cost of freights, payments of debts  and  other  invisibles and a certain amount of re-export   trade, their  present  favourable balance is  not  sufficient  for  their requirements.      6.  A further development of trade would also be in our interests.  We have in the past invested in these countries a sum estimated at  100 million,  the service of which  is at present being only partially paid.  In the years 1927-29, United Kingdom exports to these countries averaged over  10 million a year and there is still a  large  demand  for  British goods there,  but in recent years  the value of our exports has fallen to  little more than  6 million a year, and, even so, in several countries there has been an accumulation of unpaid trade debts.  We have sought to collect our claims by clearings or payments agreements, but no substantial improvement in the position can be looked for unless we can take more imports from these countries.      7.  A fortiori, such an  increase in our imports from them is an essential condition of any expansion of normal export credits to these countries.  Under the principles on which the  Export  Credits  Guarantee Department works, the Department can only grant credits on a commercial basis, i.e., before  arranging a credit it has to be satisfied that adequate security for its repayment is available. This security can only  be found ultimately by  increasing the exports  of the countries  concerned and, broadly speaking, if new credits on  any considerable scale are  to be considered, by  increasing their exports  to the United Kingdom. For,  while exports  to  other free exchange  markets might in some cases  be acceptable as security, it is  clearly difficult for us to  count with certainty  on exports to markets other than our own.      8.  But there are great  difficulties in  any further  expansion of the exports from these countries  to  the  United Kingdom.  Most of them  are agricultural countries  and our quotas and sanitary regulations prevent them increasing their- trade in such commodities as bacon, pork and chilled meat.  Our Ottawa commit- ments subject their wheat to a duty of 2s. a quarter, which makes it difficult for them to compete with the Dominion wheat, which enjoys free  entry here; while the preference granted to Empire tobacco handicaps the staple export of Greece and Bulgaria. Moreover, the heavy buying by Germany has forced internal prices in most of these countries above the world level, and. makes it difficult for them to sell in the United Kingdom  market without  special subsidies.      9.  In fact most of  the countries concerned are so  anxious to keep up their trade with free-exchange markets that they encourage their exports to these markets by some form of direct or indirect subsidies in order to bridge the gap in price-levels.   It is only by this means that the present volume of trade has been attained.   There are,  however,  limits to the extent to which the Governments can afford to subsidise their exports.      10.   If we are to retain our position in the countries in question, some special means must be devised of overcoming these difficulties and increasing our imports from them.  In  this  respect the promotion of individual  transactions, though they may have  a psychological value, will be  only of temporary effect.  What isv really needed is  a permanent increase in the regular flow of trade.                     Consideration of  Individual  Countries.      11.   The considerations set  Out  above  apply generally, but the problem of finding a remedy is more urgent and important in some cases than in others. Certain countries are Already  so largely within the German orbit, economically or politically, as to discount the results of any effort to increase our trade with them. In others, which are less exposed  to  German  penetration, or which we
might be able  to protect in time of war, we  might hope, while not excludingGermany from a large share of the market, to retain a considerable degree ofeconomic and  political  influence.   The  committee  is advised  that, from thepolitical point of view, the most urgent need is to provide some form of economic assistance for Greece,  in fact, it is urged that Greece is in a category apart, sinceshe alone of  the countries with which the committee is concerned is primarily a mediterranean country.   For this reason  it is pointed out that we cannot afford to disinterest ourselves  in  her  policy, whatever may be the fate of the othercountries of South-Eastern Piurope.  Moreover, we can&apos;make use of her co-opera-tion in war and afford her a degree of support which would be impossible in thecase of the other countries concerned.  Our traditional friendship with Greecegives us  a basis upon which to work, but she is  already showing signs of  jealousyat the credits we have  given to Turkey, and would strongly resent an  appearance of preference for any other  of her neighbours.  For these reasons, if any  questionof priority arises, the  claims of Roumania, Yugoslavia and Bulgaria should, itis felt, rank  after those of Greece.   Hungary is, for other reasons, also a special case.   On the one hand,  she has shown as much anxiety as  any to maintain and increase  her trade  with  us.   Proximity adds to her fear of Germany,  and sheappears to be doing all she can to maintain some freedom of manoeuvre in difficultcircumstances.  She is asking very little from us in the way of assistance, and itseems, therefore, worth while to  do what we can to help her.  On the other hand,it must be recognised that we could do nothing effective to help Hungary againsta determined attack by Germany on her  independence, and it would be unwise,therefore,  to make any  disproportionate efforts on her  behalf  which  might precipitate counter-measures by Germany.     12.  The following is a summary of the proposals which have been considered for assisting individual countries.Greece.     13.  While, as stated above, it is most  urgent  to find some means of givingGreece economic assistance, Greece is particularly  difficult to deal with.  TheGreek Government want credits from the United Kingdom for the purchase (a) ofbig guns and fortifications for coast defence, (5) of anti-aircraft guns, and (c) of equipment for their air force. But apart from the fact that the Export credits guarantee Department are debarred by statute from guaranteeing credits for warmaterial, and that  we  have little or no capacity for the export of such material in present conditions there is no commercial basis for any large-scale credit to greece at present.   The visible  balance of trade of Greece with this country is normally adverse, i.e.,  she already imports more from us  than she exports to us,and accordingly she has no surplus sterling proceeds of exports which could afford the basis of a new credit.  It is true that  she is in general a country which relieson invisible items,  such as  shipping and  emigrants&apos; remittances,  to balance herpayments account.  At present/ however,  she is in  default on her existing debtsand there is a long-standing and  still unsettled dispute between the Greek Govern-ment and the Council of  Foreign Bondholders on the subject.    14.  The position could only  be substantially altered if some additionalexport from Greece to the United Kingdom could be provided for.  Unfortunately,apart  from currants, of  which  we  already purchase  80  per cent, of our total requirements from  Greece,  Greece has few exports which are of any interest tous.  The export which the Greek Government particularly desire to encourage isthat of tobacco.  The  Greek tobacco is of  high  quality  and commands a goodmarket, particularly in Germany and in the United States, but out of a totalexport of tobacco from Greece of about  8  million last year, the exports to theUnited Kingdom  amounted to   47,000  only, representing about one-fifth  of1 per cent, of our imports of foreign tobacco.   The tobacco concerns in this country have  accustomed the British public to smoking  the Virginian  leaf and theymaintain that  it would  be against their  financial interest to  encourage theconsumption of Greek tobacco.  They are not  at all likely to purchase anysubstantial quantity for  sale as  such unless either the Greek Government or theBritish Government are  prepared to make good any loss incurred in marketingit.   The only possibility of  arranging purchases on  the  scale  required (e.g., 500,000 per annum) would seem to depend on inducing all the tobacco companies to blend  a small percentage of oriental tobacco in their Virginian brands.  The
 tobacco  companies would not favour such  a proposal, as  it would necessitate altering their trade descriptions, e.g., from &quot;Pure Virginian &quot;  to  &quot;Virginian blend,&quot; and the Imperial Tobacco Company, which attaches particular importance to its Virginian cigarette trade, would not be disposed to agree to  such a proposal except under compulsion.  At any rate, it would be necessary&quot; for His Majesty&apos;s Government to exercise very strong pressure on them before there is any likelihood of their accepting the proposal.  In considering any intervention of  this kind, account would have to be taken of the interests of the Empire tobacco  growers and also of the fact that the United States, whose requests for concessions  to American tobacco  have been refused in  the  recent trade negotiations,  would  look  with suspicion on any efforts to stimulate consumption of other tobaccos.     15.   As subsidiary points, it may be mentioned :      (a)  That the British-American Tobacco  Company, which purchases  about             140,000  worth of Greek  tobacco for its  American business, has            arranged  to  ship this tobacco to England instead of to Antwerp for            storage, despite the  fact that this  diversion  will  involve  it in an            additional cost of some thousands of  pounds.     (b)  That certain metal interests are exploring the  possibility of developing            the export to the United Kingdom of Greek minerals; but this  will,            at best, take a considerable time  to arrange and  is not likely to be of            more than subsidiary importance.     16..   It is,  of course, open to the Export Credits Guarantee Department to give a credit without specific security if they and the Treasury are satisfied of the honesty  and solvency of the country concerned; but up  to the present  it has not been possible for the Department to regard  Greece, by commercial standards, as credit-worthy  for  any  large  sum.  If,  therefore, it is  considered politically desirable to give her a  substantial  credit, the only means would be  by securing parliamentary authority for  a guaranteed loan, the service of which would be undertaken as a direct obligation by the Greek  Government.  But this proposal has been turned down by the Treasury.   The grounds for this  decision were : (a) that, unless we can  import more Greek goods,  there is no prospect that the service of a loan can be met and a further default would give rise to political friction as well as loss to  the taxpayer; (b) that  a guaranteed  loan, involving legislation, would certainly be regarded in Germany and Italy  as  inspired by anti-axis motives.     17.   We have been receiving from the Greek Government repeated appeals  recently renewed in more insistent terms for assistance and co-operation both in the political and in the economic field.  There is no doubt that,  if our response even as regards the economic field is going to be negative or non-committal, the Greek Government will  draw the conclusion that we are not willing to  help them to persevere in their pro-British policy.  The more one studies the problem, the more clear it becomes that the natural and most  effective solution  is the purchase of Greek tobacco by  this country.   By doing so we should give Greece the free currency which she requires to pay her debts, an  alternative market to that of Germany for at least some of her produce, and, lastly, a basis on which she could obtain commercial credits in this country and thus  increase the volume  of British exports.                              &apos;. Roumania.     18.   The present Roumanian  Government are strongly Anglophil, and are desperately anxious to interest the United Kingdom in  the development of theirt country.   They have submitted a long list of capital goods which are required and which would be ordered from  this country if credits were  available.  But at present Roumania is in difficulties with her existing debts (paying her creditors from year to year a percentage of their claims which the  creditors&apos; representatives regard as inadequate),  and on the trade side there  is a substantial  arrear of trade debts to be met in the clearing.     19.   On the other hand, Roumania exports  a  number of commodities which have a world market, and the whole situation would be altered if we could take a larger proportion of these exports, and particularly of wheat and  oil.
    20.  As  regards  wheat,  the Roumanian Government have been anxious  tosell a substantial part of their exportable surplus on the British market and,as it  has not been possible so far to do this through normal trade  channels,they have pressed for a purchase by His Majesty&apos;s Government.  In response  totheir urgent requests, a decision has recently been taken to purchase 200,000 tonsof Roumanian wheat to replace part of the stocks acquired for the  essential commodities Reserve when these  are due  to be  turned  over.  The roumanian government have, however, indicated  that the amount in  question falls far short of their hopes, and that they will still be left with a large surplus which, failingother  arrangements,  they will have to dispose  of to Germany.  As in the caseof tobacco in Greece,  the question  of wheat is of crucial  significance in the eyes of the Roumanian Government.  Important as  it may be, however,  to help them out of their present  difficulties in  this respect, it should be borne in mind thata  Government  purchase  of wheat, if it is not  repeated, will provide only atemporary stimulus to Anglo-Roumanian trade.    21.  As regards oil, British companies operating in Roumania are responsiblefor some 40 per cent, of  the total  oil  production, but the exports to the UnitedKingdom have been declining, particularly in the past year.  A number of reasonsmay be given for this  decline, not the least being the reduced Roumanian produc-tion and the Roumanian policy in regard both to the Mining Law and to exports.Moreover, the large companies which control the distribution of oil in this country have their own sources of supply  in  other parts of the  world, and there are anumber of considerations which affect the marketing of oil  in any particular country.  It appears  that, for commercial reasons, the imports of Roumanian oilare not likely to be increased unless His Majesty&apos;s Government can induce thelarger oil companies  to  purchase  certain quantities  from Roumania  at world prices.  There could be no question of any Government purchases of Roumanianoil as the Government supplies have  to be drawn  from sources which are less vulnerable, in time of emergency,  than the Mediterranean; and from this pointof view, there may be objection to increasing even the commercial supplies whichwe take from Roumania.   If this is not regarded as a decisive Consideration, thepossibility of inducing the oil  companies to  increase the quantities  of their commercial purchases from Roumania deserves  to be further explored.    22.  The Roumanian Government are also anxious  to interest British capital in the exploitation of mines and industries in  Roumania as well as in the con-struction of a naval base, but the treatment to which existing foreign investmentsin Roumania have been subjected  is not  such  as to encourage any  fresh invest-ments or the extension of large-scale credits by  the Export Credits guarantee department.Yugoslavia.    23.  Certain conversations took   place last year with  Yugoslavia which appeared to  suggest  that some credit on  a commercial basis could have beenarranged  with Yugoslavia, but  the Yugoslav  Government have taken  no stepsto pursue their negotiations.  In the summer of this year, preliminary investiga-tions showed that the prospects for a  credit agreement on the lines  of the recentagreement with Turkey were not  encouraging  and  the question was not raised with the Yugoslav authorities.  This possibility will, nevertheless, be borne  inmind, particularly with  reference to  the development of  Yugoslavia^ mineral resources  with the aid of British capital.  In  general,  however,  the Germanposition seems likely  to be strengthened as the result of  Dr. Eunk&apos;s recent visit to Belgrade, and for  the present the chances of materially increasing our share in the trade of Yugoslavia are slender.Bulgaria.    24.   The Bulgarian Government are anxious to obtain credits in this countryfor the supply of ships, railway  material and war material.  Discussions arein progress on this  subject with  the Bulgarian Minister in London, and theExport  Credits Guarantee Department is hopeful that a satisfactory basis maybe found for a  commercial credit,  if British export  prices are not too high.  If,however, this is confined to non-military  material, it appears unlikely  to exceedsome   500,000, which is  all that  the Bulgarian Government seem inclined  atpresent to devote to  purchases in  the United  Kingdom for other than military
purposes.  The further  1,500,000 which they would like to spend on armamentscannot be covered by the Department under their present statute.  considerations which must be borne in mind are (1)  that, under an arrangement which was .reluctantly accepted by her creditors and comes to an end in November, Bulgariais paying only a^ fraction of the full service of her foreign loans, and that thebondholders would object  to  any credits  being  given to  her pending a more satisfactory settlement of their claims; (2) that  rumours of a loan to Bulgariahave  already elicited expressions of concern  from the Greek Government, whowould resent the grant of  such assistance to her before  they  themselves have .been served.Hungary.    25.  Although economically Hungary is, no doubt, largely in  the Germanorbit, the  Hungarian Government is most anxious to maintain and,  indeed, toimprove its  trade with this country, with a  view to  strengthening its foreign exchange position.  Various Hungarian representatives visited London last July,and submitted  certain suggestions which would  facilitate an increase of their exports to the United Kingdom.  Most of these suggestions were clearly impracticable-cable, and the least objectionable appeared to be some reduction in the duty onturkeys (which would  also  help  Yugoslavia).    The  present  duty of  3d. a  lb.represents about 35 per cent, of the c.i.f. value, and there is some doubt whetherthe Hungarian turkey is  really competitive with the  home product.   But  theMinistry of  Agriculture oppose  any reduction of  the present duty, and I.D.A.C.have recently reviewed the position and have advised against any concession.                                 Conclusion.    26.  The committee will continue to explore the possibilities, but the facts setout above show  that  the  chief requirement  of the  South-Eastern  european countries is to find additional possibilities of export  to the United kingdom market.    27.  Their  present  difficulties  in  this  respect  are  partly  due  to theirown financial and monetary policies, which, in conjunction with heavy Germanbuying, have allowed their internal prices to rise unduly. The countries concerned could improve their export prospects if  they could bring the prices of their pro-ducts into closer adjustment with world prices.  This would probably involve alarger measure of depreciation of their exchange than is at present allowed.  Sometentative steps in this direction have been taken (e.g., by allowing special premiaon exports to free-currency countries or by allowing part of the proceeds of exportsto be sold on  the  free market), but  any alteration of  the exchange rate raisesinternal problems of great complexity, and His Majesty&apos;s Government could noturge  a general policy  of  exchange depreciation on  these  countries without incurring a considerable and dangerous responsibility.    28.  While, therefore, we can urge these countries to bring about a readjust-ment  of their exchanges and price levels, the measure in which this can be donemust  be decided by their Governments.  So long as we maintain a free currency,they  will undoubtedly be anxious to maintain their position  in the UnitedKingdom market, and from the psychological point of view the best answer we can give to the German propaganda is to allow them free use of the proceeds of their exports to the  United Kingdom.  In the  interests of commercial and financialcreditors,  we have had in  certain cases to arrange clearings; but the less rigidthese are the more goodwill we are likely to retain. A great deal more is, however,required if we are to increase or even to maintain our trade with these countries inthe face of the pressure to which they are being subjected by Germany.4   29.  Germany controls her export  and import trade rigidly, and it is theGerman  Government which decides from what  sources her  imports are to be derived.  This is an essential factor in her success in obtaining so predominant aposition in the trade of these countries.   In the United Kingdom traders are free to buy in the best and cheapest market, and there is no machinery by which theGovernment can control the source of imports. Thus, as soon as Germany forcesup the price of the goods which the countries  concerned have to  export, this factalone makes it difficult  for these countries  to  sell their goods in  the  UnitedKingdom unless they are prepared to grant some sort of export subsidy. But, in
addition,  we have since 1932 adopted  a system of agricultural protection and empire preference, which necessarily handicaps imports from the agriculturalcountries of South-Eastern Europe.    30.  During the past three years our imports from the countries in questionhave averaged about  L)\ million per annum, or a little over 1 per cent, of our total imports.  An increase in our imports from 1 per cent, to 2 per cent, of our total  imports would be a very  substantial help  to  these countries and would materially assist to maintain our influence there; but it is difficult to see how this can be done unless His Majesty&apos;s Government are  prepared  to  consider someradical modification of our existing commercial policy.  The following suggestions have been put forward :     31.  (a) If it were possible to modify our duties and our quota restrictionson agricultural produce where they restrict imports from these countries, we wouldcertainly succeed in taking more of their goods.  But we could only do so at thecost of diminishing the protection of our home market and reducing our Ottawapreferences, and  it seems impracticable to contemplate  any action in this&apos; sensemerely to help the agricultural countries of South-Eastern Europe.  The  onlypossibility is that some modification of our protective system and of Empirepreferences  may be arranged in the course  of bilateral  negotiations, e.g., if theUnited States  Trade  Agreement  goes  through, the  abrogation of the duty  onforeign wheat would tend to help the Roumanian and Bulgarian exporters.    32.  (&amp;) An  obvious  and direct way of holding our  own in the face  ofGermany&apos;s policy in these countries could be found if His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwere to take further powers to purchase commodities, whether for storage or forresale.  It could  be pointed out in justification of such an exceptional measurethat  under the existing system of exchange controls it is  impossible for us toincrease our exports to these countries, or  even, in some cases, to get paid for what we do export and for what we  have lent in the past, unless we can increase our purchases of their goods; and  that accordingly it is  desirable that&apos; a Govern-ment agency should have power  to  purchase  commodities for resale, even,  ifnecessary, at some loss. If  we could succeed in buying when prices are low  (andour help is most needed) and reselling when prices are higher, we might  be ableto limit the financial loss to moderate dimensions.  If the  purchases were arrangedthrough the normal trade channels  we might be able to avoid some of the criticismson the part of traders which this form  of State trading would most certainly involve.    33.  But the objections to Government trading  are widespread and deeplyfelt, and measures of  this kind would be criticised as a radical departure fromthe existing economic system of the country.  Moreover, if we possessed powers ofthis nature  we should  be exposed to  demands from various countries to purchaseeverything which they have to sell  and cannot otherwise  dispose  of, and therewould be  constant complaints from&apos; countries from whom we were not preparedto make Government purchases.    34.  An alternative method of arriving at the same result, without arousingthe political criticisms that would be directed against State purchasing, wouldbe to encourage private business interests to set up the necessary organisation to handle trade with South-Eastern  Europe on the same lines as Germany,  i.e.,  bypurchasing their products at high prices and by selling to them, in return,  UnitedKingdom goods at equally high prices.   This system  has been practised with success by some Central European firms (e.g., Skoda) in the past and individualtransactions have been carried out by  British traders to liquidate their frozenclaims. But it is improbable that private capital would be inclined to take therisk of initiating such trade on  a large scale without  some direct Governmentbacking.  This difficulty of meeting  financial losses would arise in regard to anyattempt  to  create a private organisation to  handle commodity trade in thesecountries^    35.   (c) If neither of these solutions can be adopted, it would  be of consider-able value if we  could persuade our great  combines  to  buy  more oil and wheat and  especially tobacco from these countries.  These great organisations  have avery powerful position in the national  economy, and it  is not unreasonable thatthey should be asked to take account of  national interests.  On the other hand,they have to consider  their  business interests and in so far as the government policy might involve them in a trading loss they may well suggest that this lossshould be made good by the  Government.  It would be difficult, however, to obtain
the necessary parliamentary authority to pay compensation, and it may be hopedthat, if the Government pressed the proposal upon them as being of vital national importance, they might be induced to accept it without claiming compensation.    36.  (d) There remains the suggestion that, as in the case of the armamentscredit  to Turkey, His Majesty&apos;s Government should be prepared to grant creditson a frankly non-commercial basis and take the  risk (political and financial) of subsequent  default.   But there are obvious disadvantages in granting  creditswhich  are not, in fact, likely to be repaid; while if an attempt is made to obtain some special security it is probable that the position of existing creditors, whethercommercial  or financial, will be seriously worsened, and we should only be payingPeter  by robbing Paul.  Moreover, such guaranteed loans  do not  effect  any permanent change in the position, and even if they may be regarded as producingpolitical gratitude when the credits are first made, they cannot be expected to have such lasting effect as a permanent arrangement for increasing our purchases fromthe countries concerned.    37.  Short,  however, of granting loans on a purely political basis, there isa possibility that  the Export Credits Guarantee Department might  be  able to guarantee certain credits to some of these  countries by taking a greater risk thanthey have hitherto considered sound.  An  argument in favour  of somewhatspeculative  credits of this  kind (apart from the political advantages they mayproduce) is that,  in the present conditions in  South-Eastern Europe, whenordinary market loans are  impracticable,  and when the organisation of trade is largely in   Government hands,  it may  be  necessary to  assure  the  countries concerned of a British  Government  credit in order to get them to  apply them-selves  to working out the detailed  marketing schemes  which might make theoperation solvent.    38.  It has  been pointed out in connexion with the  question of credits thatat present   the Export Credits  Guarantee  Department has  no power to give guarantees in respect of munitions of war,  so that special legislation is, in  anycase, required before the Government  can guarantee credits for the purchase ofwar material.  If the Export Guarantees Act were to  be amended so as to permitsuch credits, some of the requirements of  the South-Eastern European countriesin this respect  might  be met without ad hoc  legislation being  necessary ineach case.                                 Summary.    39.  To sum up, the four main possibilities that might be considered are :--    (a) Modifications  of tariffs,  quotas  and preferences  where  they restrict          United Kingdom imports from these countries.    (&amp;) Direct purchases either by the Government or by some organisation with          Government backing.    (c) Increased purchases by the great  trade interests of such commodities as          wheat, oil, and particularly tobacco.    (d) The grant of credits either on a frankly non-commercial or on a somewhat          speculative basis.    40.  Each of these suggestions presents great and obvious difficulties if  any large-scale measures are contemplated.  As between them, (b)  direct government purchases and  id) non-commercial  credits  are,  at  the best,  only  temporarypalliatives;  the real solution is to be found in an increase of normal trade.  we desire  to emphasise that, if it  is the object of  His  Majesty&apos;s Government tosecure  this,  a decision of policy is required, instructing the responsible depart-ments  (1) to modify existing restrictions which adversely affect  imports fromthese countries,  so far as we have power to do  so, and  (2) in so far as  it may still be necessary, to press large British undertakings  to avail  themselves of such imports. Action under the  second head seems  necessary to deal with  Greektobacco and Roumanian oil;  while action under  the  first head would enable usto make some concessions which  would  be  helpful  to  the  trade of all thesecountries; and, if it went far enough, would provide them with free exchange for their armament credits (which, from  the point of view of normal trade, are less important); while  the indication of  a  greater willingness to  take imports would  have  a general, diffused effect in all these countries which nothing else can produce.
    41.  Unless we  can import considerably  more from these countries, there appears to be no way in which we can secure  larger payments in respect of our financial claims from them, maintain  any substantial volume of British tradewith them, or keep up our influence in that part of Europe so far as this depends on commercial  as opposed to military  and political factors.  If  His Majesty&apos;sGovernment are not prepared to contemplate any such  steps, it would&apos; appearfutile to pursue any large-scale plans for the extension of trade or credits to thesecountries.  A certain volume of trade  with the United Kingdom will no doubt be maintained, but  we must expect  it to diminish  if  Germany succeeds in establishing herself more and more strongly in these countries.                                 Signed on behalf of the Committee :                                                    F. W.  LEITH-ROSS.October 26, 1938
