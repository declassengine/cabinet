Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.    IN.a recent series of telegrams, of which copies are annexed (Annexes T-IV),His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in China communicates an impressive appeal fromGeneral Chiang Kai-shek to His Majesty&apos;s  Government  for some measure  offinancial assistance in prosecuting the war with Japan.  In support of his request the leader of the Chinese Government and their national forces urged once more that China was fighting not only for her own  independent  existence, but also forthe preservation of British interests in the Far East.  A victory for Japan meantthe destruction of those interests  and the undermining  of the whole british position and prestige in the Orient.  For months, the General said, he had  beenhearing much about loans, and had been put off with the excuse that loans were difficult because of parliamentary  complications.   But  the whole world  hadwitnessed the granting almost over-night to Czechoslovakia  of a loan of the extent that China desired.  China thought her own case was as deserving and of no less importance to the world policy of Great Britain.  This action had made a mostpainful impression on his country.    2.  General Chiang emphasised that we were at the parting of the ways, andthat he asked for a clear and early  answer, as he  needed it in  time for theNationalist  party  conference  to be  held at Chungking  at the  beginning  ofDecember, when the whole question  of foreign  policy would be discussed and important decisions taken. If Great Britain now refused her help -he would neverbring up the question again.  He would no longer concern himself  with our far eastern policy or consult us on his own.  China would be  compelled to seek newfriends, and there were, he said, several roads open to her which led away from us.    3.  In reply to questions by Sir A. Clark Kerr,  he admitted that one of theselay in the direction of Russia, but he also indicated that lenient terms could beobtained from the Japanese if China were willing  to join Japan in a policy ofexclusion of Great Britain from the Ear East.    4.  The Ambassador &apos;s comment on the interview is that, while the picturepresented by General  Chiang is  overdrawn,  he, Sir Archibald,  is  in agreementwith much of what has been said.  He agrees that our whole position in China isfast slipping from under us, and he accepts the Generals  statement that we areat the parting of the ways when a definite decision must be taken by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment as to the granting or withholding of substantial help to the ChineseGovernment, something that will be  of immediate practical use to them.  the ambassador believes that the keeping of the goodwill  of the Chinese, even at the      10140  [18253]                                              BSECRET.CP. 266 (38).
price of some temporary financial loss, is something of real and lasting value andof essential importance to our whole future position in China. He urges therefore&quot; with: all the earnestness at my command &quot; that the Cabinet&apos;s decision to rule out any form of loan to China should be re-examined in.the light of Chiang Kai-shek&apos;s-statement.    5.  As regards the course likely to be  followed by the Chinese Government inthe event of a rejection of this request, the  Ambassador expresses the opinion that,although a  Russian  orientation would be  dangerous enough,  infinitely  moredisastrous from our point of view would  be coming to terms with Japan on thebasis of the exclusion of British interests in the Far East.    6.  While it does not appear  likely from the general tenor of GeneralChiang&apos;s remarks that he himself contemplates this second  alternative it would,nevertheless, be a serious possibility  if the remainder of his Government and his military colleagues, discouraged by their lack of success in the field and absenceof help from  the Western  Powers,  were to desert Chiang Kai-shek and open negotiations with the Japanese.  There is already  a &quot; peace party &quot; in the back-ground, containing some of the more influential politicians, and there is  no doubtthat tentative conversations through intermediaries are being conducted  with theJapanese authorities.  In that case it is likely that the  Chinese Communists, now working with the Nationalist party, would break away and continue the resistanceagainst the Japanese such as they did against Chiang Kai-shek himself in theyears before the war.  Their activities, however, would be in the far west of China,where they would be in touch with Soviet  sources of supply and the more easternprovinces, where British trading interests are to be found, would be in the handsof the pro-Japanese regime.   We should have no friends  left  in any part of thecountry, and the liquidation of our commercial position could be expected  to followwithout delay.  The best means of preventing this or the other dangerous outcome of the war would appear  to be to  strengthen Chiang Kai-shek&apos;s hold on his followers and render him less dependent  on Soviet support by giving him  suchfinancial assistance as may be possible.                 &apos;         ,    7.  On the 13th July last the Cabinet decided &apos;&apos; that, in view of the seriousinternational situation  and the reactions that might  be  caused first on japan and subsequently in Europe by the adoption of the proposals in CP. 152 (38) forgiving financial support to China, those proposals  should  not he adopted.&quot;   It isnot at present suggested that developments  in the meantime have  justified a departure from that  attitude, so far as a loan for purely  political purposes isconcerned, though, with the continuation of the tension in Europe, it is becoming increasingly important from the political and strategic  standpoint,  to preventthe collapse of Chinese resistance and the setting free pf  Japanese  militaryand naval resources for other objectives.  A proposal has, however, recently been putforward by the Chinese authorities for a banking  credit to support the exchange value of the Chinese national currency.  The plan is described in  Sir A. ClarkKerrs telegram No.  7. Tour Series, of the  24th  October, of which a copy isalso  annexed  (Annex  V).   The  Chinese Government  are contemplating  theestablishment  of  a stabilisation fund  for maintaining the Chinese dollar at itspresent rate.   The Chinese banks are ready to contribute to a total of  3 million.but they feel  that without outside help the  future is uncertain and that  theywould have to withdraw this support so as to reserve  their  resources for themilitary requirements of the Chinese Government, in which case the  collapse ofthe dollar is, in their view, almost certain.  The request is made, therefore, thatBritish banks  will jointly  advance  a similar amount towards the fund.   TheBritish banks operating in China being commercial enterprises could not make an  adequate contribution unless they had the backing of the Bank of  England:The further suggestion made on behalf of the Chinese authorities  is  that if theBank of England could support the fund to the extent of   5 or eyeh  10 million the  margin  of  safety would  make the  dollar impregnable   over  a  long period despite reiterated shocks on account of untoward military events.    8.  So far as Japanese reactions are poncerned the proposition can be pre-sented as. an effort to support our financial  and commercial interests in China,which wquld  undoubtedly  be badly  hit by  a collapse  of  the  Chinese exchange.The Japanese  could not justifiably  protest against such action, particularly ifit &quot;were linked with some assurance as to the payment of British  loans, and an
undertaking by  the  Chinese  Government  to  permit the implementation .of thecustoms arrangement reached by His Majesty&apos;s Government and the JapaneseGovernment in May of this year, as suggested by His Majesty?ss Ambassador atTokyo in his telegram No. 1357, of which a copy is annexed (Annex VI).  HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassador in Tokyo agreed in June last that a credit which wouldbe devoted under, guarantee exclusively for the maintenance of the currency wouldnot be open to the same objections as. one for general purposes.  The Japanese,on occasion, have themselves admitted that it Was to their interest to maintain theChinese currency, as if it deteriorated it would adversely affect the new currency in the north.-    9.  I am of  Opinion that the Chinese request should be favourably considered.It is suggested that the simplest course would  be for the Governor df the Bank ofEngland to give  the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation the supportthat it would need to meet the Chinese requirements to trie extent of  3 million.I understand,  however, that  the governor does hot feel able to do this.  I there-fore  recommend that the Governihent should  ask Parliament to  authorise  aguarantee of  3  million to the Hong Kohg Bank so that it can proceed.                                Conclusion.    10:   In view of the  considerations advanced by His Majesty&apos;s  ambassador in Chiiia as set Out above, and of the necessity of returning, a not too unfavourablereply to General Chiang Kai-shek&apos;s appeal, I  trust that it may be found pbssibletb agree to the  proposal for the introduction of  the  necessary legislation to guarantee a Contribution of  3  million to the Chinese currency  stabilisationfund, oh condition that the Chinese Government, for their part; permit the customsarrangement between His Majesty&apos;s Government arid the Japanese Government with&amp; implemented.

ANNEX  I.       Sir A. Clark Kerr to Viscount Halifax. (Received November 11.)                               [By Wireless.](No. 13.   Tour Series A.  Important.)(Telegraphic.)                                 Changsha, November 7, 1938.    I HAD yesterday with Chiang Kai-sheik what he described as a straight talk.He began by saying tha/t he wished to stick to fundamentals and  to review thesituation as it stood to-day.    2.  The fall of Hankow, which had long been discounted, had not changed itmaterially, but  the fall of Canton (which, he admitted, had come  to him, as to everyone else, as a very unpleasant surprise), had brought about an entirely hewsituation so far as we were concerned.    3.  In occupying Canton the Japanese had been guided by two motives.  Thefirst was the effect of such occupation upon war in China, and the second, a deeperand subtler, was the effect on Great Britain.  To strike at China was ultimatelyof minor importance, while to strike at Great Britain meant much more to Chinaand Japan,  and obviously dealt a severe blow by cutting off her source of supplyand so on, but her hope thereby  to break the morale of Chinese people would be frustrated for they would continue the struggle.  But to British prestige the blowhad been much heavier. British prestige, a thing of immense importance in theFar East  to ourselves  and Chinese alike, could weather  inaction  in  face of a japanese occupation of North China,  Shanghai  and even of Yangtze Valley, butit could not survive our tacit acceptance of occupation of South China; in any caseits maintenance was essential to the upkeeping of the whole British position inthe Far East.  Once it were gone he doubted if it could ever be regained.    4.  The Japanese  were bent on displanting us from our historical  positionin South China.   They were now well on the way to achieving [group omitted].As our position tottered, Japan&apos;s power and prestige increased  proportionatelyin the eyes of Chinese and all Asiatic people.    5.  Canton had felt  safe in its proximity  to  Hong  Kong, an unreasonablefeeling if you will, but one which has  been none the less very deep.   The occupa-tion of Canton and our puzzling acquiescence in it had shaken the 100-year-oldChinese belief in the prestige of  Great Britain, which would  now shift to Japan.The doubts set in the mind of the Southern Chinese would quickly  spread to therest of China, with effects upon our whole position in this country which he did notcare to contemplate, but which he thought [group undecypherable] His Majesty^Government would be wise  to ponder on.    6.  What upon reflection  was our  attitude  towards this  latest move of japanese?   Were we going quietly to accept destruction of our position or werewe going to show in unmistakable terms  that we were determined  to uphold  it?He would like a definite answer to this question.  ^    7.  He  was astonished that no one in London seemed to appreciate that inChina the British were now at the parting of the ways and had been long enough in and had seen enough of this country to realise  that China&apos;s enduring friendshipwas ours for the asking.   All that was needed  to cement it  was a  helping handfrom us.    8.  For sixteen months now China has  been fighting single-handed, to saveherself it was true, but also to save our interests.  She had  looked and was stilllooking to us for help.  If we gave it we would find that her memory was longand that we would be amply recompensed.   If we withheld it, disillusionmentwould drive her into a bitterness that would be lasting and  vindictive.  He andhis Government would not be able to ignore this.  His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwould be well advised  to take this into account.  Did we not understand that a victory for Japan  meant the  destruction of British interests in China, and thata victory  of China, if denied the help she asked, meant the holding of us infuture at a long arm&apos;s length ?    9.  The undertakings we had entered into at Geneva justified him in askingwhat  was our policy in the Far  East.   Were we going back  from China or were
5-    24we going to truckle with Japan in hope of saving something from the wreck?We should dismiss that hope, for if Japan won Asia we would save nothingat all.    10.  He was grateful for what we had done  so  far, in particular for allthat Hong Kong hadjneant.  But now Hong Kong had  dropped out^of the pictureand he wanted  to know  what we were going-to do.   Were we ready to  giveChina  the kind of help  she  needed ?  To  this question  he wanted a straightanswer.  If it were &quot;No,&quot; he would be obliged  to reorientate his whole policyand to look elsewhere for friends.   He did not want to do this, for he and thewhole  of China still  wished to  believe in us.  But  we  were forcing it  upon him.   Nevertheless there  was still time to  save  him from it.    11.  His present appeals for our help are the last he would make.  If GreatBritain turns her back upon her principles and upon China, he would never bring up the question again.  He would never again concern  himself with our policy inthe Far East or consult us about China&apos;s future policy or anything else.    12.  As before, he was now asking for financial  assistance in the form of support for  Chinese civilisation.   China did  not  expect  anything  more.   for months he had been hearing much about loans and had been put off from time totime, but with  excuses that loans  were at  present [group omitted] because ofparliamentary complications.   But the whole world had witnessed the grantingalmost overnight to Czechoslovakia of a loan of  the [? extent] that China has asked for.  China thought her own case was [group undecipherable] as  deservingand of no less importance to world policy of Great  Britain/  He could not disguisefrom me that this had made a most painful  impression on  this country.    13.  He was forced to believe  that in fact we  were afraid of the  Japanese.But what had we got to fear ?  Japan was so deeply involved in China and so near the end of her tether that she could do little or nothing more to damage us than she had done already.    14.  Whatever decision we took,  however, we  must realise that China wasunited as never before and as determined  as ever to  continue resistance.   Hisarmies were intact and he had the materials he  needed  for another year. .   15.  Japan was unquestionably eager for peace, but a Japanese peace wouldmean  nothing for Great Britain.   He had  good  reason to believe that if china were willing to  join Japan in a policy of exclusion of Great Britain  from far east, Japan would yield up everything she had won since the war began.  If that question came up, what was China&apos;s answer going to be?    16.  He ended by saying that he must have  a clear and an early answer,because the future policy of China depended upon it.  There were several roadsopen to her which led  away from us.    17.  By way of a postscript he added that if  answer was &quot; No,&quot;  he proposedto declare war on Japan.  As he saw it, and he had discussed all its implicationswith his legal adviser, China now had more  to gain than to lose by a formal stateof Avar.  He asked what was the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government on this point.    Please see my immediately following telegram.

I have reported at length what Chiang Kai-shek said because I thought it important that you should know what was in his  mind. He himself set greatimportance upon it, and begged that I would send you genera! faithful account       [18253]             &apos;                                       B 3
of it.  Throughout he spoke with earnestness and from time to time with passion,but he was  as friendly as he has always been to  me.    2.  I need not say that in  reply to  him I made full use of the materialcontained in your telegrams Nos. 27, Tour Series, of 17th October and 894  of19th October to Shanghai. But it was of no avail. He swept it all aside and saidthat the time hao! come for fundamentals  and straight talking.&apos;    3.  His main points may.be summed up as follows :           (1) The decline of our prestige.          (2) Whether we thought it worth while to attempt to re-establish it                 and in doing so to retain the  friendship of China.          (3) What was likely to happen if Ave let this friendship go.          (4) What was our policy.          (5) His  need for  money.          (6) His  determination whatever happened to go on with the war.    4.  While his  picture is overdrawn, I  am bound to  say  that, generallyspeaking, I  find myself in agreement with much of what he said.  He did notexaggerate when he said that our prestige had suffered.  It had sunk low enoughbefore Canton fell, and  there can be no  doubt that our  silence in face of the invasion of  South China has given it a further push downward.  It  is urgently necessary to do something to restore it.    5.  As I see it, our whole position in this country is fast slipping from underus, partly on account of inaction forced upon us by situation in Europe, but morebecause of general indecision of our policy, which, as seen here, is governed by fearof Japan.    6.  Most  Chinese  understand that  so long as  there  is no appeasement inEurope it is useless to hope for military help, but none of them understand why we cannot give them financial help.  What Chiang  Kai-shek said about Czecho-slovakia is being said by everyone else.   The merits of the argument count fornothing.  &quot; 7.  I think he was right when he said we were at parting of the ways.  i submit the time has come to decide once and  for all whether we  are going to do something for the Chinese which will be of immediate practical use to them, or toretreat  from  engagements entered into  at Geneva and  pin  our faith on the assurances of Japan.  For myself I regard these assurances as worthless, while Iconsider the keeping of the goodwill of the Chinese, even perhaps at the price ofsome temporary financial loss, to be something of real and lasting value of essentialimportance  to our whole position in this country in future.     8.  The faith of the  Chinese in us has been genuine and deep, but  they arefast losing it.   If the answer to Chiang Kai-shek&apos;s present appeal is to be &quot; No,&apos;&apos;this faith will be difficult, if not impossible, to  recapture.   Chiang Kai-shek haspointed the  direction in which things will move.  It promises consequences uponwhich we have to pay dearly.  It was to be foreseen that Chiang  Kai-shek would ask for a clear statement of our policy.   In the circumstances in which he findshimself this request does not seem unfair.  The question was put to me  by theMinister for Foreign Affairs at Hankow in July, when I managed to evade it.  ButI cannot do this with Chiang Kai-shek.     9.  I have not overlooked the Cabinet&apos;s decision to  rake out any  form ofloan to China, but I venture to urge with all the earnestness at my command thatthe whole matter should be re-examined in the  light of Chiang Kai-shek&apos;s state-ment.  If, upon consideration, His Majesty&apos;s  Government see their way to rendersome assistance to China much lost ground will be regained at a blow, but in orderto have full value it would have to be accompanied by some clear mark of the lineour policy is to follow.  I mean that we would have to  show that we were notafraid of Japan.   The first step towards this might be the denunciation of  theAnglo-Japanese Commercial Treaty.  4  Please  see my immediately following telegram.

ANNEX  III.       Sir A. Clark K&amp;rr to Viscount Halifax. -(Received\,November                              [By Wireless.](No. 15.   Tour Series A.  Important.)(Telegraphic.)                                 Changsha, November ,8, 1938.    MY telegram No. 14, Tour Series A.    Chiang Kai-shek asked unceasingly when he might expect a reply to hisquestions, explaining that he needed it in time for Kuomintang Conference to beheld at Chungking at the beginning of December, when the whole question offoreign policy would be discussed and important decisions taken.    In Kuomintang there is a pro-Russian party led by Sun Fo,  and amongst other members there is a &quot;peace  at any price&quot; party which has probably  been strengthened by recent events.    I  ought, perhaps, to have explained there  was nothing in the way chiang kai-shek -shek made his statement to me which suggested a threat.  When he spoke of necessity of seeking other friends than ourselves,  he made it clear that Chinawould not abandon us  until  she knew for certain that we were decided toabandon her.    When I asked him whither he would turn for new friends  and whether itwould be towards Russia, he said there were two or three roads open to him andthat leading to Russia was one of them.    This combined with a China  becoming unfriendly to us would  be dangerousenough,  but infinitely more  dangerous would be a coming to terms with japan on the basis of exclusion of ourselves from the Far  East.  At present T doubt histaking this way of escape, but it can by no means be ruled out as a possibility andan approach to it might, in the first instance, be made through Germany.    After my talk with Chiang  Kai-shek, I asked his  wife, who  had acted asinterpreter, how it would be possible,  if the improbable policy  of co-operationwith  Japan were adopted,  to swing  the Chinese people over  from  their presenthatred to a willingness to  work with  Japanese.   She explained  that chiang kai-shek -shek&apos;s influence in the country was so strong that, whatever policy he came out for, he could carry the. people with him.     It is true that his influence is immense, but I am disposed to doubt whetheraffairs would be as simple as this or whether the  Communists would follow himalong  this road.

I FIND it difficult from here to give you an appreciation of situation of thekind I was able to send you from Hankow.   There were scores of people whose views could be taken.  Here  there is no one but  Chiang Kai-shek  himself andDonald.    Chiang Kai-shek bears no mark of depression.  He professes complete faith in ultimate victory, claims that his armies are intact and well equipped, and thathe has 180 divisions of trained men and material enough, at present  high rate of wastage, to last another year, irrespective of what he might be still able to- import.
He does not propose to attempt to hold a definite line in Hunan.  He does not admit loss of this province will deprive him of contact and control Over Kiangsi,Fukien,  [group  undecypherable]  Chekiang, where he also has large forces.  InHunan  he will resist Japanese advance until  resistance becomes too costly. Hewill then withdraw.westward, where he still has plenty of room an&apos;d where it willbe hard f df Japahese tb follow line; there he will refit softie of his armies.  Mean-while, he asserts the  task of the Japanese soldiers will become more  and moredifficult, becoming indeed critically so when in a fe,w months  his organisationsbehind Japanese lines Moscow fighter squadrbhs and large regular military unitsleft behind to reinforce them-reach their peak of efficiency.  When he is1 satisfiedthat  Japanese are sufficiently enfeebled by passage of  time, by expense andinanition, he will move east again.a    He is convinced that the  people are with him,  and that the strength of hishold  bh  parts  bf  China now in  Japanese dccupatibn  is  and wili  remainundiminished, and will Be sufficient to render task Of pacification and exploitationby Japanese impossible.     In  time he1 will  create  a new China, which,  in due  course, will restoreindependence to the East.  But this will take time and Chinese are&apos; a patrioticpeople arid time is On their side.     Of  His  military claims I am hot competent to judge,  but that concerningcreation of a hew China is less improbable than at first glance it may seem, whenit is&apos; remembered that in moving westward Chiang Kai-shek has taken  with him a large part  of  China&apos;s military officers, universities,  intellectual^,  students,machinery,- industrial resources (estimation put figure as much as 100 [group undecypherable] ), emigrants of all classes and trade  [two groups undecyphef-able] material and natural resources, and native [group undecypherable J westernprovinces he ftiay Well be able to achieve much of What he hopes tb.

A float in H.M.S, Daring, October 24;  1938.     T. V. SOONG tells me that Chinese Government are contemplating establish-ment of a stabilisation fund.  He claims (1) that at present rate of  8d. Chinesedollar is undervalued, so that barring temporary shocks to confidence, rate of 8d.could be easily maintained.     (2) That  both  Chinese and British bankers believe  that, even with loss ofHankow, present rate can be maintained, provided a reasonably large stabilisationfund be set up.     (3) Hitherto Bank of China, in eo-operation with Hong Kong and ShanghaiBank, has been supporting the market.  Until 12th October there have been somenet gains in acquisition of foreign exchange.  But since attack on  Canton, theBank Of China has had tb put up  1-J million.  The Chinese banks are ready tocontribute to fund up to a total bf   3 million; but they feel that without outsidehelp the future is uncertain, and that they would have to withdraw this supportso as1 to reserve their resources for military requirements of Chinese Government,in which base  the collapse bf the dollar is almost cbrtain.

shocks on account of untoward  military events.  If the fund be established asmall committee of Chinese and British bankers can control its policy and operatethrough the two British banks.    He wishes to stress the urgent need of immediate assistance and describes the situation as really critical.    Grayburn, with srhom I discussed the project, made it clear that his bankwould not move without full support from London.    (Repeated to Shanghai, No. 14.)    I HAVE discussed  Chinese customs question  fully with  financial  advisersince his return, and it appears to us that the deterioration continues apace:  I appreciate that you attach great importance to maintenance of administration,but it is becoming increasingly difficult for me to intervene effectively to arrestdeterioration owing to the refusal of Chinese Government to implement Anglo-Japanese arrangement of 3rd May last.                                .    2.  I  do  not  know  what,  if any,  assistance you may  decide  to give theChinese Government as a result of Sir A. Clark Kerr&apos;s telegrams to you (Nos. 13,14, 15 and 17, Tour series), but if assistance be given, I  venture to suggest it being conditional upon (a) immediate formal implementations of Anglo-Japanesearrangements; or  (b) acquiescence  in implementation of  this arrangement (ifnecessary under protest)  by the Inspector-General of Customs.  If procedure (b)is adopted, Inspector-General of Customs will require to be fully covered.    3.  I am sure that Japanese Government would not now agree to any amend-ment, and it is by no means certain that the Japanese will now incline to implementeven original  agreement  in view of the long delay  and alterations of  the situa-tion.  (On the latter point I would, of  course, make necessary soundings before any action were taken as recommended.)  But early implementation  seems to meto present the only remaining hope of stopping the steady sapping  of [ ? inter-national] character and integrity of the  customs.
