Acf                  OA B I N E Te                NATIONAL SERVICE.        Memorandum &quot;by  the Lord. Privy Seals     The object of any plan for organising &quot;national service&apos;1must he. to find people  for  jobs, not to find jobs for people.Unless this truth is borne in mind there are bound to Toeconfusion of purpose and failure to distinguish between endsand means.   It is important, therefore, to begin by defining the ends..   They seem  to fall naturally into two main divisions.The first consists of  the preparations to be made for the first stage of a war, when we may expect to have to defend ourselvesagainst an intensive air attack, with its crisis falling at the outset...   The other. consists of the preparations to be made for possible later stages  of a war, in which home defence may become of less importance and service in the field of greater,and events may work gradually up to a crisis.   There is oneobvious and vital difference between them.   All preparations for the first stage need to be completed, beforehand in everydetail.    All men who are required must be ready to take theirallotted places the moment war is inevitable.   For the second stage all that it is necessary to do at present is to make sure that machinery of control has been devised, ready.to be assembled when the time comes, and capable of being used in whatever way circumstances may then dictate.    I propose toconsider these two stages separately.FIRST STAGE   THE ENDS.     Here we have three main objects to secure:-     (a)  that all those people whose normal civil occupations
 are essential to  the  life  of the  cormudity or the armed defence of the country  should continue to perform tneiTu       (h) that^all the services which will take part in national defence  (whether  &quot;active&quot;  or &quot;passive&quot;) should have a full complement, fully trained? of people not falling within the first category,       (c)  that  there  should he a supplementary reservoir of man- power which can he readily drawn upon,- whether to make good vacancies in the other two categories, to fill needs that cannot at present he foreseen, or to supply special skill or experience for special purposes.,     Such are the ends in the first stage.    Before going on to the means I should perhaps remark that the duties of a National Service Authority must be partljr executive and partly co- ordinativen    As regards matters falling within the scope of some existing G-overnment Department,  such as the  recruitment  and training of men for the various  services,  they will &quot;be co-*ordinative;   as regards matters  which do  not-  such as deciding. what  occupations are of essential importance,  or  creating a general reservoir of volunteers,  they will he  executive    Up to now the executive work has &quot;been done by the  Ministry of  Labour and the co-ordinative work by Sub-Committees of the Committee of Imperial Defence., FIRST  STAC-E   THE MEANS.     Now as to the means.    A &quot;Schedule of Reserved Occupations&quot; has been drawn up with immense  care  by the Ministry of Labour, in consultation with the Departments concerned,.    It shows  in  what jobs,  and between what ages,  men must be regarded as doing  work&apos;    v of national  importance and not  available  for other things^    It is in  the hands of all Managers  of Employment  Exchanges  for use on the outbreak of war to  prevent enlistment of men engaged on occupations  comprised in it.   That  has, up  to now,  been regarded as its only function,  and  it  has  not been  published..
        As to co-ordinating recruitment for the various services.  Departments  have &quot;been kept in touch with one another,  &quot;bjxt the only  overt act of co-ordination has  been to fix. age-limits for  certain A.&amp;;Po services, calablated to leave  for the Territorial Army men of the  most suitable ages.   In particular,  no  man under 60 is regarded as eligible  for any of  the A.E.?. services,  except the police and firemen,  and no  man under 25 even for these,.        Up  to  the time  of the crisis the only  action that had been  taken  in the  way  of creating a reservoir of volunteers was  to form registers of certain classes of men of sciencea  - The offers of voluntary service which the crisis  evoked led to registers being opened at the Divisional Offices of  the  Ministry of Labour,  as  well as a  central register (for people with special qualifications) at the  headqvAarters  of  the Minis try0    These  are  being maintained,,        Such  are  the  measures already taken in preparation for  the First Stage.    The experience of  the  crisis showed that they need  to be supplemented,  and certain further steps were already contemplated at the time of my appo intment eFIRS.T. STACKS .-. PROPOSALS.       My proposals  are as  follows6       Hitherto appeals for  volunteers for the various forms of national service  have been made  singly andsporadically for one service at  a  time.   The  most  obviousneed of the moment is a general  appeal for-volunteers for all services, accompanied by full  information as  towhat these services  are, how many  recruits each needs, andof what type, and the conditions of service and training.
 A proposal has  already  &quot;been before  the  Cabinet  that  a Handbook to National  Service  should form  the basis of an appeal  of  this  sort,   A proof of such a publication  is annexed. *  I  propose  that a copy should be delivered eventtially at every house in  the country,  and that its distribution  should be  accompanied  by press and broadcast publicity.        It  is  clearly  necessary  that an  appeal of  this sort should  also particularise those large classes of  the iwg-. illation, who must not  respond  to the call  because  they are already doing work of national  importance^  The Schedule of Reserved Occupations must  be published,.   It is too bulky to be attached  to the Handbook, but  the Handbook should  contain  a rough  indication of its  contents, and the Schedule itself should be made  available  in some  other way.        It  is  also  proposed that registers  of volLinteers should  be kept, not only at the Divisional Offices of the Ministry of Labour, but also  at every Employment Exchange,. Indeed,  I am  informed by the  Ministry of Labour that forms&apos; and instructions for  this purpose are ready.   It has moreover been suggested, and  I agree, that some Authority should be available for giving guidance,  oral or written, to persons  in doubt as to where their duty lies, and that this Authority should be SOKBthing  that looks rs.th.er more imposing to the ordinary citizen than the Manager of the local Employment Exchange.    It is proposed, therefore,  that local national Service Committees should be set up for this purpose, with the appropriate Employment ExchangeManager  to act as Secretary.   This fact will,  of course,be stated in  the Handbook.   The Handbook will also tell its readers about  the local and central registers, and invite enrolment from those who, for one reason or another,are not  able  to train for a particular service.
     Such are ray proposals for the additional action whichshould he taken immediately in order to utilise the presentatmosphere in organising man-power for the First Stage of a war.,Certain features of it will call for more consideration indetail, but these are not matters which need delay the appeal,or on which it is necessary for me to trouble my colleagues atpresent.    The following is a rough estimate of the quantitative-scope of the proposals,                                             Further                                  Existing.   number     Total,                                             required.,Estimated number of males aged 16 and upwards in essential occupations included in the Schedule of Reserved Occupat- ions who-are reserved or are outside military age.                                 8,30,0,000872,000 1,701,000Regular Army, Navy and Air Force  397,000)Auxiliary and Reserves ditto.      432,000) A.R.P. services, including   police and firemen.            750., 000     400,000 1,150,000  Total number of people  comprised in defence  organisation,                                      11,151,000To which must be added the entries on the voluntary register, the number of which there is no means of estimating.SECOND STAGE.     Plans already formulated contemplate the following action^  These figures do not include women,S See C. I.D. Paper N. S. (0. M. ) 29.                        -5-
 At  the  earliest possible  moment  after the  outbreak of war,  a Ministry  of  National  Service  will be  set up  under the powers created by administers  of the Grown (Emergency Appointments.) Act,    A  Secretary  and  Deputy-Secretary have already  been designated for  this ministry,  which will take over on bloc certain sections  of the Ministry of Labour,  together  with  the Employment Exchanges, and the recruiting staffs  of the Service Departments.  It  Is also contemplated (a)  that compulsory military service should  le introduced as soon as a Bill for  that purpose can be  passed,  and (b)  that  there should be  legislation  giving the Department  certain control  over the movement  of  civilian labour,  so  as  to ensure that  essential occupations  are not denuded of men.    These  two  Bills &quot;are already in draft,*   Pending  the enactment of compulsory military  service, an official of the  Ministry of Labour will be  associated with  every  recruiting office,  so as  to make sure that people  in  the  Schebaile of Reserved Occupations do not go into the  Array-      I am not  wholly convinced by  the case  for  compulsory military  service  immediately  after  the outbreak  of war, although  I recognise the  force of the  argument that,  if we do not want  it  to get  men  into the Array,  we shall want it to keep them out.     Exit what is quite  certain is that, whatever decision were taken now,  it would be  reviewed on the outbreak of war  in the light of  the circumstances then existing,   I therefore suggest that  the sensible course is to take no decision about this now, but  to make such arrangements that w-; are ^prepared for  eitherc course.-.      I think that  the plans  for the Second Stage are sound.and I have no modification or amplification to suggestoSee OoloDo  Paper No S. (0* M. ) 29.                    -6-
In  the  Second  Stage,  unlike  the First,  we  shall have time %40think,  and.  it  would he  a mistake  to make rigid plans forcircumstances  which cannot he  foreseen.  What we want ismachinery that can he adapted  smoothly  to  any purpose.NATIORAL REQIST3R.                                             F           Or      A compulsory National  Register  cannot he an  end initself;  it can only  he a means to an end, and must be  judgedaccordingly.      The proposals that I have sketched above will mean ex-tensive registration  of personnel in  one way or another.There is, for  instance, what already  amounts practically to a register of employees in the Engineering,  Shipbuilding, Metaland certain other industries.4&quot;   The  Departments concerned will of course have registers  of  all  those who have volunteeredfor the various services enumerated in  the Handbook,   Andthere will  also be the  central and local registers of theMinistry of labour and  Exchanges.   Everyone, therefore, whohas a direct part to  play in National Defence will be regis--tered and identifiable,  So will  a large number of others,forming an  unallocated  reserve.   It  is true that  the severalregisters will not be combined in any central register, butthat does not  seem to me a point  of importance.  What more would a compulsory National Register  give us?  I am assuming,of course,  that the voluntary  system  has produced  the numbersthat we want for the  First Stage,  If it does not, it willhave failed, and we shall have to think again.    But for themoment we must  assume that it  will succeed.  The only addit-ional thing  that the  compulsory National Register would give us would be  the  names of a large number of people who exhypothesi neither want nor are wanted to do anything^  I havenever been  able  to understand  how it can seriously be contended that a compulsory National Register has any value,  except as                                             -ta prelude to some form of compulsory service.     * See C. I.D. Paper N. S. (CM.  ) 29. -
PLAN FOR EXPEDITING PREPARATION OF NATIONAL REGISTER IN CASBOF KEEP.     I  think, however, that in view of the decision already taken - with.,which I am in full agreement - that provision should  he made for the establishment of a Ministry of NationalService on the outbreak of war, there are certain steps that can and should be taken now to expedite the compilation of acomplete national register if and when a decision to that effect  is taken.  The fact that the next decennial censusfalls due in 1941 provides a ready means to this end.   the registrar General informs me that he srould, without incurringany material extra expense, proceed to build up now the organ-isation that will eventually be used for the 1941 census:  andif, in&quot;addition, he were authorised to print the necessaryforms (at a cost which he estimates at  6,000 or  7,000) hewould,  when these processes had been completed, be in aposition to bring a complete national register into being at &apos;any time on very short notice.  I recommend that the necessaryauthority be given.NATIONAL SERVICE TRAINING.     There is one further point to which,  for the sake ofcompleteness, I feel I should make brief reference in this note.I do not think the present widespread eagerness to serve willbe fully satisfied without further and better provision fortraining in what I may call - for want of a better term - goodcitizenship.   I am thinking,  in this connection,  more particu-larly of persons for whose services even in a part-timecapacity there is no immediate use and who can therefore finda place only in a general reserve register.    I recommend thatthe Ministers concerned should consult together at once with aview to formulating,  for submission to the Cabinet,  detailed proposals for the institution of such a scheme of citizenshiptraining.
                  SUMMARY.     To summarise - my suggestions to the cabinet are -     (l) That all the practical requirements of the presentsituation can be fully met by the plans outlined above which.contemplate (a) the issue of a suitable handbook for the guidance of would-be volunteers;  (b) a. general appeal for volunteers:  (c) the local compilation or registers of volunteers under an organisation to be set up ad hoc by theMinistry of Labour,     (2) That preparations should at once be made t.e admitof the immediate compilation of a complete national registerin case of emergency,     (3) That extended provision le made for good .citizenship training..

FINAL  REPORT.    WE* were appointed by the Man-Power Sub-Committee of the Committee ofImperial  Defence  on the  26th January,  1938, &quot;to reconsider, in the  lightof the present war plans of the Departments, the measures to be taken, both onthe outbfeakTrf a major war and in making preparations&apos;for it, to secure themost.effective use of the man-power of the country.&quot;    2.  Our task has accordingly fallen into two parts.   In so far  as we havehad to concern ourselves with preparatory action taken in advance of a possibleemergency, it has been our duty  to try to co-ordinate the activities of departments which are recruiting volunteers for various purposes.   On this subject we havemade several Interim Reports and we shall continue to keep the question underreview, as need may arise.  The present Report deals with the other side of oursubject namely, the formulation of plans for control of man-power which will come into effect on the outbreak of war and not before.    3.  This subject was dealt with in a comprehensive Report by a Sub-Com-mittee under Sir W. Graham Greene, dated  the 27th  June,  1922 (C.I.D. PaperNo. 350-B), which forms the basis of all subsequent study of  the question.  Inaccordance  with  the recommendation  of  that  Committee,  a  Standing  Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence was set up under the Chairman-ship first of Lord Swinton and  afterwards of  Sir Thomas  Inskip, with the dutyof following up the various recommendations made by it for working out in detailplans for the control of man-power on the lines suggested.  This has been  done,and the Committee has metj and still  meets,  periodically,  for  the  purpose  ofinitiating and  reviewing such  work  as falls to be done  in pursuance of thisdecision, by Government Departments or Sub-Committees of its own.    4.  We do not think it necessary to go over again in any detail groundworkthat has already been amply covered in other documents.  It will be enough ifwe summarise briefly the essential features of these plans, dwelling particularly on points which call  for Ministerial decision, either because circumstances have changed since a decision was taken on  them.,  or because they have not yet beensubmitted for consideration.    5.  The essential features of the plans        follows :  .    (1) That there, should be a Ministry of  National Service in control of the          allocation of man-power, for  all purposes.   It should have a Minister          at its head and  it is for  consideration whether he ought not to be a          member of whatever  body is in supreme control  of the direction of the          war.  There  should  be transferred to it the staff and offices of the          Ministry  of  Labour Employment  Exchanges and  the  Recruiting          Organisations of the Service Departments.  Each division should be          placed in charge of a Divisional Commissioner specially nominated          from  among persons  of  influence  and  standing in  that Division.          (These Commissioners have already been chosen.)t    (2) That, on the outbreak  of  war,  legislation  should be passed as soon as          practicable to provide for the constitution of  this Ministry  and to           impose on all men of military age a liability  to compulsory  service          with the armed forces.   Bills should also  be  passed (a)  to give the           Ministry  certain powers of control over the  movement  of  civilian          labour, and (&amp;) to provide for the taking of a National Register.    (3) That  schedules should be  prepared  of the  occupations  from  which           (subject to appropriate age limits in each case) men must not be  taken           for military service t. and  that arrangements should be made by which          university graduates and undergraduates can be treated primarily as           a field of selection for officers or for employment on any special duties           for which they may have special qualifications.    *  See Appendix &apos;F for composition of the Sub-Committee.    j-  They are at present allocated temporarily to the posts  of Regional Commissioners underthe Home Defence Scheme, and  if war comes before other selections  are made., for /these poststheir National Service responsibilities will have to be  assumed by. the  Divisional Controller ofthe Ministry of Labour.                                      -    $  On mobilisation reservists will, of course, rejoin the  colours, even though in  reserved occupations.   Ordinarily  they will be kept there,  though  there  will be a few exceptions.Certain Territorials in reserved  occupations will be sent back to them  forthwith, except in theA.A. Divisions, where they will be retained.                                  fts-fil
    6.  Among the questions on which Ministerial decisions, or confirmation of previous decisions, are now required are :     (1) Is the Ministry of National Service to be set up  immediately on the           outbreak of war ?    (2) Is the Compulsory Service Act  to be passed immediately on&apos; the outbreak           of war, and what are to be its nature and scope %    (3) Is the  Act for controlling the movement of civilian labour to be passed           immediately  on the  outbreak  of  war,  and  what are  to be  its           provisions ?                                              .  .    (4) In view  of the  provisional  decision not to create a  full Ministry of           Supply, what authority is to be responsible for (a) control over wages           and (b) the allocation and dilution of labour and in what way 1    (5) Is a  National Register to be taken, and, if so, when?Time  when the Ministry of National Service should be set up and  compulsory        military  service introduced.    7.  The  conclusion of the Graham Greene Committee was that a voluntary system of  recruitment could not be relied  upon to produce with  any efficiencyarmed forces to a total much in excess of 750,000 men.  Since the plans whichthen  held the field included raising an army of  some 2,000,000 men withmtwelve months, they  had no hesitation in recommending conscription from the start.  We understand that,  under present plans, not  more than 750,000 men will be needed in this time,  and we have  no  doubt that they could be got by voluntary recruiting.  Nevertheless, we recommend adherence to the decision that,provided, of  course, that the Government of the day think it politically possible,compulsion should be introduced as  soon as practicable.   The Graham GreeneCommittee gave an impressive summary (paragraph 3) of the practical advantages of the compulsory over the voluntary system. We agree, although we realise thata final decision can  only be  taken in the light  of  the circumstances  actuallyexisting,  especially the state  of public feeling and the nature of our  militaryplans.  The  experience of the last war shows how difficult it is to get men into their  right places once they have got in the wrong ones,  and the only effective way of starting right is to have statutory powers from the beginning.  It is truethat Schedules of reserved  occupations are ready, and, if voluntary recruiting-does take  place (as indeed it must for a  time),  an official of the Ministry ofNational Service (or of the Ministry of Labour if the Ministry of National service has not yet been constituted) will be  associated with each recruiting  centre witha view to preventing the acceptance of men whose occupations are  on the list.But, in the absence of a compulsory system,  administered by a Department whichis&apos;responsible for man-power in every field,  it will not be easy to ensure that thissystem works successfully.  Moreover,  whatever plans may be made now, it isimpossible to foresee events with certainty. If we were forced, as  we were in1914, to improvise a large  army rapidly, it would be almost  impossible,  except by the orderly methods of compulsion, to do so without prejudicing other essential services.                                                       -    8.  Nevertheless, it will be apparent from what we have said that if, at theoutbreak of war, the Government should  feel that public opinion forces them to try the voluntary system for a time, the machinery can be adapted to  it.  Indeed,for a short period, until a  Compulsory Service Act can be passed and  put intoforce,  it must  in any case be adapted  to it, for it is impossible to contemplaterefusing  eligible  volunteers. in  any  circumstances.  We  think that,  whatever decision may be taken about this, the Ministry of National Service should be  setup as soon as possible after  the outbreak of war, with the duty  of supervising the recruitment  of the forces  and  of  controlling civilian labour in the mannerpresently to  be described, and generally of guiding voluntary effort  into appro-priate channels.  This is in accordance  with the recommendations of the GrahamGreene Committee, who  gave reasons  (paragraphs 59-62)  for  their view that&apos;&quot;&apos; the establishment of an independent authority 4.e.,  a  Ministry of NationalService is indispensable.&quot;   Appendix  A  shows the proposed lay-out of theMinistry.  It will consist largely of the transfer of personnel and functions fromthe Ministry of Labour,  and, pending its constitution,  the  Ministry of labour will be responsible for what has to be done at once.

Nature of Compulsory Service Act.    9.  In Appendix B will be found a draft Compulsory Service Bill, togetherwith an explanatory memorandum of its provisions.  It  imposes upon all maleBritish subjects between the ages of  18 and 41, except Ministers of Religion and persons already in the forces, the obligation to serve in the aimied  forces whencalled  upon.   This obligation will  be made effective by age-groups :   when  aparticular age-group, or block of age-groups, is called up, all men in that groupor those groups will be required to register themselves at the offices of the Ministry;when called upon to do so they will submit to medical examination, and, if fit, willthereafter present themselves for  enlistment.    10.  The Minister will have power to postpone the enlistment  of men who can be more usefully employed than in the armed forces, a power which will normally be exercised in accordance  with the Schedule of Reserved  Occupationsalready prepared.  This will be a  purely administrative act, not subject to appeal.There  will  also be a right of appeal,  to Tribunals  specially  constituted,  forpostponement of enlistment on the ground of exceptional  business obligations ordomestic position or conscientious objection to militant service.    11.  The only important question of policy which arises is in the field withinwhich  compulsion should be applied.  The Bill follows precedent in limiting itto service in the armed forces of the Crown.  We have considered whether, in thecircumstances likely to arise in a future war,  this goes far enough. In theorywe do not think it does; we think there is a case for extending it to the  &apos;&apos; front-line &quot; A.R.P. services such as Police, Firemen, and Rescue Parties.  In practice,however, this presents serious technical difficulties and we doubt whether anythingwould be gained of sufficient importance to justify so troublesome and contentiousa  departure.   If  there is a shortage  in the  &quot;front-line&quot; A.R.P. services itwill  have  to be filled more quickly  than the rather cumbrous  machinery of  a compulsory Service Act could fill it.   Moreover, if men in essential occupationsget  into  A.R.P.  services  the  consequences  will  be   less serious than  ifthey got  into  the Army,  for  they  can more easily   be  got out  again indue course.   The  question whether it may be  necessary,  in a critical situationin any locality, owing to air  attacks, to give the Competent Authority sweepingpowers to order anybody to do anything, is more appropriate to the Civil defence plans than  to  the man-power plans.  For these reasons  we do not recommendthat the scope of compulsion  should be thus extended.The Clean  Cut.    12.  Earlier man-power plans, made when a  large and rapid expansion ofthe army was in contemplation, provided for calling-up of the age-group 18-25,within the first six months with no exemption on the ground of essential  occupa-tion to anyone  of  Grade I fitness a process called &apos;&apos; the  clean cut.&apos;&apos; We thinkthat the &apos;&apos; clean cut &apos;&apos; should no longer form an automatic  part of the programmebut should be left an open question.   It would produce numbers larger than arenow likely to be necessary, and would take from industry an unduly large numberof skilled men,  for the expansion of industrial activity a short time ago, following the long depression, especially in shipyards, has resulted in the existence of anabnormally  large  number of skilled  men in the lower age-groups.   It  will benecessary to reserve all men under 25 in certain occupations, and some  of themin other occupations.  Apart from this we do not wish to make any recommenda-tion for a present decision as to  the scope of the initial calling up,  as we think this is a question that can only  be decided when  the time comes.   Appendix  Ccontains a statistical examination of the yield of the 18-25 and other age-groups,and of the numbers of men likely to  be wanted on present hypotheses, during thefiRst twelve months of a war.Control of civilian labour.     13.  Appendix D contains a draft Bill, with an explanatory memorandum,giving  the Minister certain powers of control over the  engagement of  labour.These  may be  conveniently summarised under  three headings :      (1) There  will be power  to  direct that all vacancies  in specified industries           should be filled through  the National Service  Offices and in no other
            way.   This means that all labour that is in the market can be directed            where it is most wanted.  Employers would not be able to poach each            other&apos;s  work-people and  an  employer  whose work  is  not  of            national importance or of less urgent  importance will not be able to            engage by psivate treaty work-people who are needed elsewhere.     (2)  Apart from  the  prevention  of  &quot; poaching,&quot;  this  provision  naturally            enables the Ministry to direct into the most urgent employment persons            who  become  unemployed.   No  doubt  the  supply  of  unemployed            craftsmen will soon be exhausted, and further requirements can then            only be met by detaching workers from work of less urgency  so that            they can undertake the work  of greater  urgency.  It is proposed for            this purpose to give the Minister power to enlist Avar-work volunteers            on the lines  of the war munitions volunteers scheme in the last war            with  certain modifications which experience on the  last occasion            showed to be desirable.     (3)  In the last  resort it  is proposed to give  the Ministry power to  require            an employer to discharge workers. This is a drastic power and would            only be used if suitable war-work volunteers cannot be obtained and            methods  of peaceful persuasion failed.  It is contemplated that there            will be technical inspectors who will visit the establishments engaged            on war-work and who will be able to  suggest methods of working in            order  to economise  labour.   No  doubt employers will  ordinarily be            willing to do what is required of them,  but  it is desirable to have a            compulsory power in the background  both for this  purpose and for            the purpose  of securing the release of workers from establishments            not engaged  on important work for  employment on work  of national            importance.   The  occasion  for  the  use  of such  a power  would            not probably arise in the early stage of the war.     Some of these proposals will be contentious, and it will probably be thoughtwise not to decide finally on  the terms of the Bill until  the Minister has takenorganisations of employers and employed into consultation.Allocation of man-power dilution of labour.     14.   It will  be  for  the Ministry of National Service, subject, of course, to cabinet  decision,  to  settle questions  arising from competing demands  for man-power between the armed forces and industrial employment.  But some  authority must also adjudicate on competing demands within the industrial field.  Somehowor other demands must be ranked on a scale of priority, so that an insufficientlabour force may  be directed  where it is  most needed.  No doubt also,  sooner or later,  the available  labour supply will have to  be  augmented  by  &quot;dilution.&quot;Here a difficulty  arises, which applies also to  the next  section  of this Report,relating  to wages and disputes.  In the plans  for  dealing  with these subjectsthe existence of a full Ministry of  Supply, responsible for almost all productionof war material,  has hitherto been assumed, and  it plays a vital part in them.Eqr  instance, the Ministry of Supply, if there is one, is  the obvious authority todetermine intra-industrial priorities.  Again, if  the Ministry of National  Servicedecides that the time has come for some men to be  released from industry  for the armed forces, and their places filled by dilution, a Ministry of Supply  would bethe natural authority to decide where they were  to come from and how they wereto be substituted, and to force employers to comply.  If there is  to be  no fullMinistry of Supply, this  duty can  only be performed  by  some co-co-ordinating committee of the  three Services, and that  is open to difficulties of which mentionis made below.Wages and disputes.     15.   This question, as well as that dealt with in the preceding paragraph, hasrecently been reported on by a Sub-Committee charged with the duty of  consider-ing the respective functions of the Ministry of Labour, Ministry of  NationalService, and Ministry of Supply in these matters.  The  conclusion was that theMinistry of National Service does not come into  this  part of the picture, that thedepartmental responsibility for regulating wages in controlled establishments
must rest with the Ministry of Supply, and in other great industries (e.g., coal and transport) with the appropriate Government Department, using as  far aspossible the ordinary conciliation machinery; that the Ministry of Labour would act in the first place as informal advisers of these  Departments, and in the second place  exercise functions of conciliation and arbitration similar to those whichthey exercise to-day; and that it  might prove necessary to take statutory powerto impose wage rates and prohibit strikes, but it was better not to attempt to makeany plans for this in advance.    16.  In the matter of wage rates there are two dangers to be guarded against.One is that an increase in the cost of living or other general factors may force ageneral rise of wages.   The other is that, for motives of  immediate expediency,increases of wages may be given to particular classes of workers, or in particular industries, which cannot be kept from spreading.  The first can only be guarded against by keeping down the cost of living, limiting profits, and having a strongcentral wages tribunal which commands general confidence.  The vital importance,in this connexion, of finding some effective means of limiting prices and  profitshas already been stressed in other Reports, but we wish once more to emphasise thepoint.  Control over wages is impossible without it.  The second danger will be aserious one, because the check ordinarily imposed on  employers by their need tomaintain competitive prices in their export markets will be gone.  Something willhave to take its place.  We had looked to the Ministry of  Supply to furnish thischeck by means of contract prices which left no  profit if any increase of wageswas given except with their approval. If there is  no Ministry of Supply, the only effective check can be for the Service Departments  to perform the same function inthe same way,  acting under the advice of their Co-ordinating Committee.    Rut in all these matters in determining priorities of  demands for labour, indilution  and  in wages-control this expedient is a very different matter fromrelying on a single Ministry of Supply  responsible generally for production.Even within a single  Ministry, as the last war showed,  the battles between theLabour Branch and the Production Branch over these matters were  acute enough.If there is no Ministry of Supply,  they will be the subject of conflict between threeLabour Branches and three Production Branches of three Departments, themselvesin conflict with one another.  A  Department responsible for the production ofwhat is needed by its particular fighting arm, but not directly for the needs of others, cannot take the same balanced view as  a Department responsible for all.Acutely conscious of the need for something for which it is departmentally respon-sible,  such a Department will not find it easy  to carry out  wholeheartedly  adecision  of a co-ordinating Committee  on Priorities that a reluctant employermust be forced to delay delivery by introducing dilution or that a strike must berisked  by refusing an advance of wages.    17.  We recognise, of course, that the decision whether there should or shouldnot be  a full Ministry of Supply involves questions outside our purview, and wedo not  presume to be competent judges of it.  But we should be doing less than our duty if we failed to point out  the grave consequences that would  follow in thefield of control of labour if  there were not an Executive Department responsible:generally for the purchase and manufacture of war supplies.&apos;National Register.    18.  We have reconsidered this question with the assistance of the Directorof the  Food (Defence Plans) Department and the Registrar-General.  It is clearthat if there could be in existence, on the outbreak of war, a complete, up-to-dateRegister of the whole population, it would be of  value both to  the  Food Depart-ment and to the Ministry of National Service.  For the former it could serve as abasis for the issue of ration books.  For the latter it would give material for a statistical estimate of man-power resources by ages and  occupations, and would afford  a means (indeed, the  only wholly effective means) of enforcing compulsory service on all who from time to time might be called up.    19.  The  Government decided some time ago that a National Register couldnot be  formed  in peace-time, nor any overt preparations made for one.  There arepractical  as well as political reasons for  not being in a  hurry,  for  accuracy  is vital,  and either lapse of  time between taking the Register and the outbreak of
 war, or movements of population during the early days of a war, or both, might seriously prejudice the usefulness of one made  before war broke  out.  And disorganisation consequent on air attacks might make  it impossible to take it in hand immediately after an outbreak.  It is necessary therefore to  contemplate having to do without a Register, for a time at any rate.                &apos;     20.  The Director of  the Food (Defence Plans) Department tells us that he has felt bound to make his plans for immediate rationing on the  assumption that there will be no National Register in existence and that, although if he could have started with a reliable Register ready-made it would have been  better, it would probably be difficult to adapt his arrangements to a Register made later.     21.  In the field of man-power the usefulness of a Register  lies, as we have seen, in its provision of the material for statistical survey, and in the knowledge that it  affords of the actual individuals to be called up for military service within various age-groups.  As regards its statistical value, this has two aspects.  One is that  it is most important to have information about the supply of skilled men, of whom there is likely to  be a shortage  in war-time.  Here, however, even if we had a National Register conducted on census  lines, it  would not by itself yield reliable results, since workmen cannot be counted on to  make sufficiently accurate and detailed descriptions of their occupations,  and there is always a tendency  for a man to exaggerate his skill and status.  But the Ministry of Labour, in conjunc- tion with the employers concerned, have recently made a special census of men employed in a number of important industries, namely, Engineering, Construction and Repair of vehicles, Metal Manufacture, Other Metal industries, Scientific and Photographic Instrument  and Apparatus Manufacture, Shipbuilding and Ship repairing.  Reliable figures have thus been  obtained for the supply of labour in the!many  different occupations included in the industries concerned, and this information has been used in the revision  of the Schedule of Reserved Occupations. For this purpose,  therefore, we have,  at any rate in the most important sphere, a substitute for a National  Register, and one which is actually more effective. The other aspect is the need to  have  a general picture of available  man-power by ages and occupations on which to frame policy in the event of a prolonged war. Here there can be no substitute for a National Register, except the last census, which is, of  course, sadly out of elate.   As regards compulsory military service, too, it cannot  be denied that to embark on conscription without an accurate register is to leave authority without effective means of enforcement, for it will be impossible to know how many of those whose ages lie within a called-up  age-group have, in fact, responded to the call,, or where the defaulters are.  All  that could be done would be to give those who had responded, but not been immediately enlisted, registration certificates, and rely for the detection of defaulters on failure to produce a registration certificate when  called upon.   The co-operation of  the public  could, of course, be  relied on to expose defaulters.     22.  In  a memorandum of  the 10th June,  1938, which  is  annexed  as Appendix  E, the Registrar-General summed up the present position  as regards a National Register and  made a  further  suggestion.   He gives  reasons why, if a Register  is to be  practicable and useful,  it ought to be taken as soon as possible after the outbreak  of war, and he returns to the question of making preparations in peace-time.   These preparations are the printing and  storage of  schedules and  forms,  the final revision of  enumeration  districts  and   the enrolment  of enumerators.   The two latter cannot be done  without a  certain measure of publicity.  He  suggested that,  although  the  Government decided some time ago against their being done in peace-time, we are now so near (about a year away) to the time when precisely these  preparations must in any case be made for the  1941 census,  that  it might  now be thought  unobjectionable  to anticipate  them,  saying frankly that we are  doing now something  that must in any  case be done in a year&apos;s time because  it might be thought desirable, ifwar broke out during the next two years, to take the next census at short noticebefore its  due date,  in order  to have up-to-date statistics of  our  man-power resources.    23.   A decision on this point rests on purely political considerations andwe make no recommendation about it.  Obviously it will only arise if the present crisis is successfully surmounted.
Summary of Recommendations.    &quot;Our recommendations are, therefore, that the plans outlined  above shouldbe generally approved, and in particular :     (1) That  the Ministry  of National  Service should be set  up by statute as           soon as possible after the outbreak of war with the functions indicated           in  Appendix A.    (2) That, unless the circumstances seem to make it undesirable or unnecessary,.           a Bill on the lines of that contained in Appendix B should be passed           as soon as possible after the outbreak of war, making all men between           18 and 41 (except Ministers of religion) liable  to compulsory  service           with the armed forces  (but not with A.R.P.), and that,  in the mean-           time, voluntary recruiting should be subject to the schedule of reserved           occupations.    (3) That  a Bill on the  lines  of that contained  in  Appendix  D should be           passed as soon as possible after the outbreak of war, giving powers           of  control over civilian labour in the manner described above.  Before           introduction it should  be  discussed with organisations  of employers           and employed.    (4) That, when the question of a Ministry of Supply falls to be  reconsidered,           the vital part that such  a Ministry would  play in the control of           man-power should be given due weight.    (5) That the decision automatically to call up all men  between  18 and 25 in           the first, six months of war should  be reversed, and no decision on this           point should be taken in advance.    (6) That, as soon as  possible after the outbreak of war, a decision  should           be  taken whether the circumstances are such as to  make a  National           Register  practicable and useful, and that, if the present emergency           does not lead to war, a decision should be taken as soon as circumstances           permit on the  Registrar-GeneraPs proposal (Appendix E)  that  the           preparations for  the 1941  census should be made in  advance.

FOR many  years the Committee of Imperial Defence plans have contem-plated that  National Registration  should be  the  basis of both rationing and recruitment.  I-t was originally assumed that an interval of some months afterthe outbreak of war would be available for the initial National Registration, andthat  it would, nevertheless, be in time for rationing  purposes and for the mainmachinery of conscription and man-power control.    2.  The position has, however, been changing in recent years.  It became clear that air raids might gravely prejudice administrative preparations in thefirst  few months.  Concurrently, the need for the institution of both rationing and some measure of conscription began to take an earlier place in the general programme.    3.  In these circumstances I made a full report to the Man-Power Committeein October  1936  of my National Registration preparations, setting forth whatpreparations could be and were  being made departmentally, and what prepara-tions had to be  left (owing to the  limits of my powers) until the outbreak.   estimated that these remaining  preparations and the  creation of the Registercould not be completed  in less than about two months  at the best, and that air raids might prolong this period.  I pointed out at the same time that the prospectmight be greatly improved if I could have authority to complete certain prepara-tions in peace time, viz.  :     (1) The printing and storage of  the necessary schedules and forms;     (2^ The final revision of enumeration districts;  and     (3) The enrolment  of enumerators.    The last two operations  would involve taking  local  authorities  and  local officers into our confidence.     4.  The Man-Power Committee regarded the above-mentioned period as too long.  Consideration then shifted towards the possibility of instituting a fullsystem of National Registration in peace time;  and a scheme was prepared bya Committee of  which I was Chairman.  This scheme was, however, rejected bythe Government;  and quite apart  from the political considerations,  I  do notregret the rejection.     5.  T$ut the  Government also rejected  my  proposal  that  I should  have authority to complete the above-mentioned preparations in peace time.     6.  So  far  as concerns National Registration preparations, therefore, theyare back  in the position set forth in my report of October  1936.  But mattershave since moved as regards the rationing and recruiting plans.  I understandthat  the  Food Defence Department,  in the natural expectation that national registration will not be ready in time to meet the need for very  early rationing,APPENDIX E.
June 10, 1938.(Initialled)       S. P. V. is proceeding with plans for an independent system of registration for rationing&apos; purposes.  Similarly,  I  gather that  plans for  an early  system of conscription and volunteering  are being made by., the.. Ministry of Labour on the basis of a provisional ad hoc registration.      7.  Thus the original  Committee of  Imperial Defence plans for National Registration asa basis for both these activities are crumbling, &quot;although they have never, so far as I am aware, been reversed  by any considered decision.  They can only be carried out, I believe, by concentrating upon the policy of taking National Registration immediately upon the outbreak of war (or immediately before it) and of preparing for that step.      8.  If National Registration is delayed for  some  months, I believe that there is a considerable risk that it will never be practicable. The facilities for large- scale administrative operations will rapidly  deteriorate.   The  difficulties of picking up the  threads  of  a  number of ad hoc temporary registration systems will be great.  And I have always maintained that  National Registration  will become very unpopular  when conscription  has begun.   The procedure  which should be regarded as merely the distribution and Collection of return forms by impersonal enumerators  will appear to the public,  if  conscription is  in force, as the rounding up of defaulters.      9.  For the sake of national prestige and public confidence, as well as for the specific objects above mentioned, National Registration on or immediately  before the outbreak seems desirable.   If the Government are not prepared to authorise openly the preparations for National Registration in peace time, there  is  one final suggestion which I ought to put  forward.   .      10.  The operation of creating a National  Register is similar to the taking of a Census.  The necessary preparations are the same for both. We shall in any case have to begin preparations for  the 1941 Census in  not  much more than a year from now.      11.  National Registration has always had the function of supplying fresh statistical information about  the people for war purposes.   If  war breaks out in the next  few  years,  the corresponding  Census information  will be  at  its maximum degree of staleness.  Could it not be  said  that we  may feel the need, later, for the purposes of the &quot; national effort  in defence preparations &quot;  of an intermediate Census before the next ordinary Census in 1941, and that this can be authorised at  short  notice by  Order-in-Council  under the  Census Act, if necessary;  that it is not certain that this will be  necessary, but  that, as a measure of precaution, instructions have been given for  departmental preparations to be undertaken at once for the next Census, in case it is decided to utilise them for  taking an intermediate Census.     12.  If authority were given to make  these preparations,  we should be able to attain to a state of readiness which would enable the National Register to be taken at very short notice.  The National Register would be taken under special war legislation, and not under the Census Act;  though all the overt preparations could be made under the Census Act.                       t v   13.  Finally, I should hope that  the enumeration work could be  undertaken by the local Air  Raid Precautions staffs, whose  organisation is very similar,  i.e.-, there is to be a group of wardens for  each tiny  enumeration district.  Local authorities might  welcome the adoption of our  system of enumeration districts modified  to the special needs of Air Raid Precautions.   Such an arrangement should be convenient for Air Raid Precautions purposes, since the officers  would have an opportunity of visiting the households and  learning  about  them.   The employment of  Air  Raid  Precautions  officers as enumerators  should enable National Registration to be taken  even under conditions  of air raids, or quite^ unobtrusively on the eve of an outbreak.  This suggestion has not &quot;as yet been discussed with the Air Raid  Precautions  Department.

NATIONAL  SERVICE   A GUIDE TO THE WAYS IN WHICH   THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY   MAY GIVE SERVICE. With  a Message   from the Prime Minister    ^    ^PUBLISHED BY HIS MAJESTY&apos;S STATIONERY OFFICE
My countrymen and countrywomen,     The desire of all of us is to live at peace with ourneighbours.  But to ensure peace we must be strong. TheCountry needs your  services and you  are anxious to playyour part.  This Guide will point  the way.  I ask you to read it carefully and to decide how you can best help.io Downing Street,January 1939.
BY THE RIGHT HONOURABLE   SIR JOHN ANDERSON, M.P.          LORD PRIVY SEALIVIEN AND  WOMEN all  over the country  are     to-day  eager to  fit  themselves  voluntarily  for national Service.   Some have  already  decided whatservice they can best give and are fitting themselves bytraining  to give it.   Others are wondering how theycan be most useful, and  I hope  that they will find  the answer in this Guide.     The call is to peace and not to war.  We have nothought  of aggression ; our one  wish is  to live at peacewith all  peoples.   But if this wish is to be fulfilled wemust be up and doing.  We must make ourselves strongso that our influence for peace may be real, and we must make ourselves safe so that others  cannot be tempted to thoughts of aggression against us.     It is  for  the  Government to  make  clear whatservice the country needs  and in what forms it can begiven,  and that is the object of this Guide.  It is  foryou to judge what  service you can best give, and thisGuide will help you to decide.     Arrangements are being made to help  those who,after reading  the  Guide, feel that they need furtheradvice.   Very soon National  Service Committees will
be  at work for this  purpose throughout the UnitedKingdom  and meantime  the  Local Offices of theMinistry of Labour will be glad to give advice.  NationalService  can take many forms :YOU MAY ALREADY BE ENGAGED IN WORK VITAL TOTHE COUNTRY&apos;S SECURITY WHICH IS ITSELF NATIONALSERVICE     It is impossible to give a complete list here of vitaloccupations; but if, for instance, you are a skilled workerin engineering, shipbuilding, aircraft construction, ironand steel, coal mining, agriculture, the Mercantile Marineor transport, then you will  serve best by continuing inyour present occupation, and you should either under-take no new  obligation in war  time or  join  a branchof service that needs persons of your skilled occupation and would use you in that occupation in war  time.  If  jyou do not undertake other obligations in war time, i hope that, if you are needed, you will fit yourself to take part in  any air raid precautions  at your place  of work ;  Iand there may be cases where part-time  duties, for  Iexample in air raid  precautions, would not interfere  Iwith a man&apos;s usual occupation.  Doctors and nurses, of  Icourse, would be  in great demand in their professions  1in war  time and should not undertake to do any other  1kind of work.YOU MAY BE ABLE TO UNDERTAKE SOME NEW WHOLE-TIME OR PART-TIME  SERVICE IN WAR  TIME AND TO  ITRAIN  YOURSELF FOR IT IN PEACE TIME     Training is  necessary  for  most  of the  forms  ofNational Service  described in  this  Guide;   but thetraining is only spare-time and not such as need ordin-  Iarily interfere with business or employment.   There&apos; are many openings for both men and women, for the young  1 and for the middle aged, for those with special qualiii- cations and for those with  none.  The  table on pages9-12 of the Guide and the Index on pages 47-48-
will  help  to direct you.   For those who are alreadytrained or are unable to train in  peace time the Guidedescribes opportunities of registration for war service.YOU MAY BE LEAVING SCHOOL OR LOOKING FOR A NEWCAREER     In this case you  may like to consider the regular police Forces or Fire  Brigades, or the regular Servicesof the Royal Navy, Army and Royal  Air  Force whichare described in the Guide.EVERYONE OF  US to-day wants to give some form ofNational Service.  Many men and women are already,as I have  said, filling the occupations  in which theywould give their best  service, but many will be wanted and  wanted  ready  trained for  new  duties if anemergency conies.   Here you will find an account of themain forms of  seryice  which the  country  needs.Remember, too, that the fit man and the fit woman canrender the best service ;  therefore support the NationalPhysical Fitness  Movement  and let Physical Fitnessaid National Service.     I invite you all to ask the question  :  &quot; How can Ibest help my country to maintain peace and security ? &quot;I send you this book in the hope that it will help you to find the right answer to your question.

AIR   RAID  PRECAUTIONSThe country&apos;s defence against air attack depends to a great extent uponthe men and women who are prepared to join the various branches ofthe Air Raid Precautions  Service,  including the Police War Reserve(page    ) and the Auxiliary Fire Service (page  ) ; there are alreadyover a million volunteers in this service and another half-million arewanted.   All volunteers  need to undergo  training in peace-time ifthey are to be of real value in war,  but the training is only part-timeand should not  ordinarily interfere with business or  employment.Training is free and the necessary equipment is provided.  Most of the volunteers would serve on a part-time basis in war timeand would give such service as they were able, but about 500,000 arewanted who would be embodied for whole-time service in war, forwhich they would  be paid;  the latter would  give an undertaking toserve  in their home district  whenever called upon to do so.  Com-pensation for death or disablement in the course of duty would be paidin war time in respect of both part-time and whole-time  volunteers.  Volunteers  in  the Air Raid  Precautions Service can transfer fromone Local Authority to another if they change their homes.                   Air Raid WardensThe Air Raid Wardens are the foundation of the Air Raid PrecautionsService.  There is to be a wardens&apos; post consisting of 5 to 6 wardensto every 400 to  500  inhabitants,  and  it is the business of thewardens to have a thorough knowledge of their sector, of its inhabitants,of the location  of gas  mains, electric cables,  telephones, shelters andtrenches.  They would be responsible for keeping in touch with theinhabitants of their sector and giving them advice.  The wardenswould usually be the  first on  the scene  when air raid damage had occurred, and would be responsible for summoning the proper formof help and for doing  what they could themselves until its arrival.QUALIFICATIONS. Air Raid Wardens should be responsible membersof the public, preferably living in the district where their duties willlie.  Men and some women are needed, between the ages of 25 and 50.CONDITIONS OF  SERVICE AND TRAINING.  Wardens are given anti-gas,elementary first aid and  elementary  fire training, and in additiontraining in receiving and sending messages and reports to the various branches of  the  A.R.P.  services.  Advanced training will includepractices and exercises.  The training and practices take place out ofworking  hours  and need not  ordinarily interfere  with a  warden&apos;soccupation or employment.
In  war time  most  of the wardens would serve part-time  whenthey were able, but there are also vacancies for a number of seniorwardens who would, in war time, give whole-time paid service.   Com-pensation would be paid in war time for death or disablement in thecourse of duty in the case of both part-time and whole-time wardens.HOW TO JOIN.
