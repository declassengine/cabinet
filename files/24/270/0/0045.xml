Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1, 27th July, 1937.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken to ensure the secrecy of this document.MOST SECRET COPY NO.      h*TC.P * 199-A (57). &apos;CABINET. FLEET     AIR     ARM. Note &quot;by the Secretary.I am directed by the Prime Minister to circulate the attached Supplementary Report by the Minister for Co-Ordination of Defence, to which reference is made in the covering note to CP. 199 (37), circulated last night.(Signed)     M.P.A. hankey secretary to the Cabinet,
-1-SECRET..THE NAVY AND ITS RELATION TO THE FLEET AIR ARM AND SHORE-BASED AIRCRAFT.Supplementary Report by the Minister for Co-ordinationof Defence.This Report is supplementary to my main Report on the subject of the Navy and its relation to the Fleet Air Arm.The Secretary of State for Air on receiving information as to my Report represented to the Prime Minister that he was taken by surprise by my recommendation that the Fleet Air Arm should be transferred to the Admiralty and he informed the Prime Minister that the Chief of the Air Staff had understood that questions of administrative detail or difficulty were not to be dealt with until the broad question of principle had been decided.      For this reason the Air Staff had refrained from discussing the question of organisation and administration and had not submitted to me a memorandum -which had,  in fact, been prepared dealing v/ith the questions of administrative detail.In accordance with the Prime Minister&apos;s directions, the Secretary of State for Air sent me the Air Force memorandum above referred to.      He also arranged that the Chief of the Air Staff should see me on this memorandum and that other officers, including serving officers, would hold themselves at my disposal.     The Secretary of State also expressed the hope in his letter that I should see such officers.      I have to-day had the advantage of a discussion with the Chief of&apos; the -Air Staff on these matters. Itwas not found possible to hear any statement from the. Chief of the Air Staff or from other officers on any questions of organisation or administration.      The Chief of the Air Staff informed me that it was not possible at such short notice to prepare the necessary statements and in any case it would not
&quot;be possible for me to hear the evidence before Thursday of this week.      I had. however, read the memorandum sent to me by the Secretary of State for Air and I now make the following observations.The memorandum embodies the comments by the Air Ministry on the main Admiralty memorandum previously submitted to me.     The memorandum points out that the Admiralty have not yet formulated even in outline any concrete scheme for giving effect to their demand and that in these circumstances it is impossible to examine the administrative aspects of their proposals.     This is a correct statement of the position.      I envisaged the preparation of a scheme and its examination by the Air Ministry as being the next stage of this enquiry on the assumption that the Cabinet approved rny recommendation for the transfer of the Fleet Air Arm to the Admiralty.The memorandum proceeds to recapitulate the Air Ministry thesis already discussed in my main Report that the three Departments must co-operate on a basis of &quot;particularity of function&quot;, the Navy being responsible for all forces fighting on the sea and the Air Force for all forces fighting in the air. I have nothing to add to my main report on this subject.The last paragraph of the introductory obser-vations contained in the memorandum contains thefollowing passage:-&quot;But the Air Ministry admit that under present conditions these arrangements do not operate to the fullest efficiency of which they are capable.      The organisation of the Fleet Air Arm rests upon a partnership between the Navy and the Air Force and no partnership
produces its &quot;best results if the constantaim of one of the partners is to oust theother from the business-      The existence ofthis spirit at the Admiralty from the timeof the issue of the Balfour Report onwardshas undoubtedly been prejudicial to administrativeco-operation in matters touching the Fleet air arm.11This passage sets out the Air Ministry point of view very fairly, but I read it as confirming the impression I have formed that under the existing system the relations between the Admiralty and the Air Ministry on the subject of the Fleet Air Arm have not been conducive to the best results.      I do not regard it as part of my duty to apportion the blame for these conditions.      I am of opinion, however, that the control of the Fleet Air Arm by the Admiralty would be a more natural order than the present system and as such likely to produce results which the Air Ministry state are not forthcoming.The remainder of the memorandum under review consists of a series of detailed traverses of contentions-tions advanced by the Admiralty in their main memorandum, A number of paragraphs deal with the question of shore-based aircraft in connection with which my recommendation is favourable to the Air Ministry contention.     A number of other paragraphs make what I may describe as perfectly fair debating points which do not, however, affect my judgment.      The rest and the greater part of the memor-andum deals with substantial arguments all of which, so far as I can tell,    have already been developed in the very full memoranda submitted to me by the Air Ministry. In so far as these parts of the memorandum deal with
inallegations &quot;by the Admiralty of defects in the operation of the existing system, I think it is unnecessary to deal with these having regard to the broad ground upon which I have based my recommendation.My Report,  therefore, upon the memorandum is that after reading it, I see no reason for altering my recommendation.      I am conscious that I nay lay myself open to the comment that having made up my mind without    the memorandum, I find it difficult to alter rny opinion.      I venture, however, to think that if my main Report is considered it will be seen that the detailed comments contained in the memorandum under review are not such as to affect my recommendation..
