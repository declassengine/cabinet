THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   June1937.SECRET.   , ;v &apos;    Copy No.CP. 157 (37).   &apos; - :&apos;\&quot;-;! .       &apos;CABINET.AGRICULTURE BILL.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Scotland.IN his paper of the 21st April (CP. 117 (37)) the Minister of Agriculture referred, inter alia, to the proposal for the initiation of a large-scale campaign for the eradication of animal diseases and the extension for this purpose of the State Veterinary Service. This proposal the Cabinet on the 6th May agreed to approve (Cabinet 21 (37), conclusion 1).2. Neither the paper of the Minister of Agriculture nor the decision of the Cabinet reached a conclusion on the question whether the extension of the State Veterinary Service should be on the basis of a single United Kingdom service organised under the Ministry of Agriculture, or on the basis of separate English and Scottish organisations, responsible to the Minister of Agriculture and the Secretary of State for Scotland respectively. The Minister of Agriculture, regarding the proposed service as an extension of the Diseases of Animals Acts, ^ 1894, takes the view that it should be centralised under his Department and \\j Part SS- of the draft Agriculture Bill has been drawn on this footing. My view, on the other hand, is that, having regard to the important public health aspects of the veterinary service at present administered by local authorities, and to the fact that &quot; cleaning up of the herds &quot; in Scotland has already made substantial progress under a Scottish central veterinary service, the eradication campaign in Scotland should be administered by a Scottish Department. This would follow the more recent precedent of the Milk Act, 1934, rather than that of the Diseases of Animals Act of 1894. I think this is justified, in view of the vigorous efforts made towards the eradication of disease in Scotland in recent years.3. I have discussed the position fully with the Minister of Agriculture, but it has been found impossible to reach agreement on the subject. I am accordingly setting out in this memorandum the main reasons which have led me to the conclusion indicated in the preceding paragraph.4. The Governments proposals involve the transfer to State service of local authority veterinary officers. Of these there are in Scotland 42 whole-time, and 58 part-time, officers, whose functions are primarily related to public health administration. This may be taken as equivalent to, say, 62 whole-time veterinary officers. The Secretary of State, as the Minister responsible for public health in Scotland, has at present, through the Department of Health for Scotland, jurisdiction over these officers. His approval is required by the Milk and Dairies (Scotland) Act, 1914, to the salary paid to them and to their removal from office. The local authority have to make regulations as to their duties, and these regulations require the approval of his Department of Health. The proposal of the Minister of Agriculture means, therefore, that there would be a transfer of duties from the Secretary of State for Scotland to the Minister in a sphere where Scottish public opinion is particularly sensitive.[15383]
&apos; 5. In point of numbers the local authority veterinary service is much bigger than that of the &quot;Ministry of Agriculture under the Diseases of Animals Acts. The veterinary inspection work carried out by this service under the Milk and. Dairies (Scotland) Act, 1914, is under a separate statutory code, and embodies standards of administration different from those in force in England. The appointment of veterinary inspectors, and the duty to inspect cattle, are by express statutory enactment obligatory in Scotland. In England this is not the case. Any action taken there is at the discretion of local authorities. In fact, the standards attained in Scotland are considerably in advance of those in England. There are three inspections a year for 75 per cent, of the Scottish dairy cattle, and in some areas even more. It is evident, therefore, that under the Scottish Acts and administration to which I have referred, the eradication of disease has not been neglected.6. I turn next to the Milk Act, 1934. In May, 1934, the Gowland Hopkins Committee, a Committee of the highest authority, appointed in 1932, and including persons eminent in local authority administration, such as Sir Merrik Burrell, and veterinarians of the highest standing, such as Major-General Sir John Moore, F.R.C.V.S., reported after exhaustive consideration of the whole question of animal disease, and made recommendations for its eradication which it stated should, in Scotland, be performed by the Department of Agriculture for Scotland. (Paragraph 205 of the Report.) The decision, reached after full examination, that the new functions created under the Milk Act should in Scotland be entrusted to the Secretary of State for Scotland, was in accordance with this recommendation of the Committee. The voluntary attested herds scheme established under the Act is accordingly administered in Scotland by the Department of Agriculture for Scotland. It has been remarkably successful. There are to-day 425 attested herds in Scotland, comprising 33,726 animals. At the latest date for which I have figures (the 28th May), the number of attested herds in England and Wales was only 282. This voluntary scheme is essentially similar in kind to the new eradication proposals. Indeed, the proposed new scheme is a development, though a substantial one, of the attested herds scheme, and must, like it, proceed by the establishment of areas free from disease. It will be some time before the stage is reached under the new scheme at which extensive measures for compulsory slaughter in attested areas can be established; but when it arrives there need be no inherent difficulty in superimposing a slaughter policy on that which is being followed under the present regime. On the other hand a reversal of policy now is bound to lead to comment and might not be acquiesced in by Parliament.7: A further question to which I wish to direct attention is that of meat inspection. The duty to appoint veterinary officers as meat inspectors is obligatory in Scotland, whereas in England&apos; it is not. The representatives of local authorities whom I have consulted are strongly of opinion that meat inspection should be undertaken by the proposed State Veterinary Service. I think that their contention is sound. Meat inspection would assist considerably in the campaign for the eradication of animal disease, e.g., it would enable tuberculous cows to be traced from diseased calves discovered on slaughter at abattoirs. Moreover, if it does not form part of the State service, but is left with local authorities, as the one veterinary service which they will have to carry on, it will be a relatively costly item to them and will have the added disadvantage  a most material one of throwing practically all of them back on the services of part-time veterinary surgeons. For these reasons, I do not see how the claim of the local authorities can be resisted. ,But this function again is clearly one which has the closest possible relation to public health, and I see no escape from the conclusion that it could most appropriately be administered in Scotland, like the other functions having both an agricultural and public health interest which I have mentioned, under the direction of the Minister responsible both for the Department of Health and the Department of Agriculture.&apos;&apos; 8.! The local authorities&apos; representatives who were consulted recently were unanimously in favour of a centralised veterinary service under the Secretary of State for Scotland and against a United Kingdom staff with headquarters in London. ,.; It is believed that this view applies to diseases under the Diseases of Animals Acts, which should also be transferred in appropriate cases, as well as
to the Milk and Dairies service. The position has changed since 19.22, when the County Councils. Association expressed Other views. At that time local authorities had no regular veterinary service for purposes of milk and dairies or meat inspection. ./     .:., 9. The Scottish agricultural organisations have not yet had time to report. I understand, however, that they may wish to have an opportunity of discussing this particular question, among others, and the National Farmers Union ^of Scotland, if they accept the view of their President^ committee; will press for a Scottish administration.10. The Minister of Agriculture, as I understand, opposes my proposal on three grounds : *(1) that the functions under the new scheme are so similar in nature to those at present carried out by the Ministry of Agriculture under the Diseases of Animals Acts, that it would be administratively unsound to separate them,(2) that the uniformity of administration made necessary by the considerable traffic in cattle between England and Scotland can only be secured if the scheme is administered oh a United Kingdom basis, and(3) that unification of administration on a United Kingdom basis is necessary to eradicate disease.11. With regard to the first argument, it is the case that, when the Scottish Board of Agriculture was established, the Ministry of Agriculture^ functions under the Diseases of Animals Acts were not transferred to it, This decision was reached partly for political reasons and was approved by the agricultural organisations concerned. But there is now a growing feeling in Scotland that the administration of all the disease work under the Diseases of Animals Acts should be undertaken by the Scottish Department. Whatever the arguments, however, for maintaining one central control of services relating to certain epidemic contagious diseases of animals, such as foot-and-mouth disease, I am satisfied that the functions now in question are essentially different. The main feature of the Diseases of Animals Acts functions is to suppress instantly, by drastic measures, sporadic outbreaks of highly infectious disease. The object of the new scheme is by a. gradual, though vigorous, process to eliminate forms of disease which are widespread in all parts of the country. The two problems are of a different Order, and, as I have indicated above, the new service is essentially an expansion of a form of administration already successfully undertaken in Scotland. I am disposed to think, indeed, from the preliminary discussions on the present proposals, that if a choice had to be made between transferring the Diseases of Animals Acts administration to the Department in Scotland, or transferring existing Scottish administration to the Ministry in London, Scottish opinion would much prefer the former course.12. With regard to the Ministers second argument, I do not see any reason to doubt that uniformity of administration would be secured equally well in the event of there being a separate English and Scottish scheme. The new proposals contemplate, first of all, a survey for the purpose of ascertaining the incidence of disease, and thereafter the selection of suitable areas within which steps will be taken for the compulsory&apos; eradication of disease. The criteria by which the presence of the diseases in question are ascertained must, under any system, be the same in both countries, and the standards upon which areas will be selected for the purpose of applying to them compulsory powers of eradication can also, without any difficulty, be laid down for both countries. That being so, the Minister&apos;s argument seems to me to be sustainable only if it is assumed that the quality of administration in Scotland under a separate Scottish scheme would suffer in comparison with that in England. I see no reason for supposing that this would be the case. The whole question depends almost entirely on the expenditure of public funds, and co-ordination can naturally be secured by the arrangements themselves, in the case of both countries, being subject to the approval of the Treasury. This was the course adopted in section 9 of the Milk Act, 1934, under which the attested herds scheme is functioning.13. The contention that unification under a single United Kingdom authority is necessary to ensure the eradication of disease seems to me to be
answered by the argument used in the preceding paragraph. I am satisfied that the proposed measures which, as I have pointed out, involve a long campaign against chronic and widespread disease, can be operated from Scotland without impairing in any way their effectiveness.14. I would only add that the expanded Scottish veterinary service could deal adequately with the exploratory work into other diseases which the scheme contemplates. The question of what measures should ultimately be taken to deal with these diseases does not immediately arise, but I may point but that three important Research Institutes, already dealing with animal nutrition, animal disease, and animal genetics, are located in Scotland, and that their expenses are borne on Scottish Votes. They work in close collaboration with the Department of Agriculture for Scotland and the Agricultural Colleges. As the work of the new veterinary staff will touch that of these institutes at many points, there seems to be great advantage in having that staff attached to the Scottish Depart-ments with which the Institutes are so closely associated.15. To sum up, the case for Scottish administration is that the new proposals, having a strong public health as well as agricultural interest, can most appropriately be entrusted to the Minister under whom health and agricultural administration in Scotland are already co-ordinated; that they are essentially a development of services which have already been established with a great measure of success in Scotland under existing legislation; and that they involve contact with numerous Scottish organisations closely associated with the Scottish Depart-ments. The case will undoubtedly be supported by Scottish opinion both in the House and elsewhere. It is also I think supported by the report of the Gowland-Hopkins Committee the most authoritatively impartial body by which the problem of eradication of animal disease has recently been considered which clearly contemplates both in the specific recommendations I have quoted and elsewhere, that the responsibility for carrying out the work of the central govern-ment in relation to eradication should in Scotland be undertaken by the Scottish Departments. I suggest that my colleagues ought to give very great weight to all these considerations, and that before a decision is reached the necessarily complicated questions involved should be examined by a small Cabinet Committee.16. I much regret that owing to a long standing Scottish&apos; engagement it will not be possible for me to be present at the Cabinet at which the Agriculture Bill is considered. I shall, however, arrange for a representative to be available if the Cabinet wish the arguments I have put forward to be further developed; and I shall be able to attend the meetings of any Committee to which the matter mav be referred on Thursday next or a later date.&quot;    &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; W.
