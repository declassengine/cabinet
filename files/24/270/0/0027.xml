E C RE T . Copy NoCABINET.P. 182(37)NATIONAL SOCIALIST AND FASCIST PARTY ORGANISATIONS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM.Joint Memorandum by the Home Secretary and _ the Foreign Secretary._1. At its meeting on the 29th July, 1936,  the cabinet had under consideration a joint memorandum by the Home Secretary (Sir John Simon) and the Foreign Secretary (CP.206 (36)), proposing that informal and friendly suggestions should be made to the German and Italian Governments that they should take steps to secure the closing down of branches of the National Socialist and Fascist party organisations established in the United Kingdom, the presence of which was considered undesirable.2. It was left that the question should be brought up again on some later occasion when the moment was more opportune for taking action (Cabinet 55(36), Conclusion 12).3. We feel that we must ask the Cabinet to give further consideration to this question now, not because the time is any more propitious for action, but because notice has been given by Mr. Winston Churchill (who appears to be familiar with the considerations involved) that he proposes to put a series of Questions to the&apos;Home Secretary in the House of Commons, which will no doubt attract considerable attention .4. There is not much to be added to CP.206(36)except that we are informed that both the Nazi and the Fascist party organisations in this country are becoming increasingly active and that it is obvious that the longer
action is delayed the more difficult it hecomes .5. Briefly,  the position is that there are in thiscountry highly organised branches of these two parties. They are in direct relations with the Governments of their respective countries and are thus distinguishable from any other foreign organisations.     There is, for example, no organisation of Russians in England in similar relations with the Soviet Government.The actualmembership is not large,  amounting only to a few hundreds, but they are in contact with considerable numbers of their compatriots in the United Kingdom and are able to exercise a large influence over them.The officials and members are persons who have ostensibly good reasons (e.g.,  of business) for being here and it would not be possible to make use of the normal machinery of aliens control to exclude them without appearing to discriminate against them on grounds of nationality. They are not committing, individually or as organisations, any offences against English law, nor would it be practicable to devise legislation,  of a general kind, which would make such organisations illegal.Their main present function is to weld together Germans and Italians resident in this country and to keep them faithful to the respective Nazi and Fascist ideals. At the present moment the organisations as such cannot be said to be a direct menace to the internal security of this country but they constitute a machine of immense potential danger if war became imminent.6 - It would obviously be an advantage if these organisations could be broken up but it is too much to expect that the Governments concerned would be prepared to take effective steps to disband them.      The more probable result of
representations would seem to be one of the following:-(a) that the Governments (who would no doubt adopt a concerted policy in this matter) would argue that as the organisations were not breaking the law it was unreasonable to expect that they should be disbanded.     We should then either have to drop the subject,  in which case no good would have been achieved and we should be made to look foolish,  or we should have to proceed to the logical consequence of requiring at any rate the leaders to leave the country, which would have unsatisfactory effects on our relations with Germany and Italy:(b) that the Governments would undertake to break up the organisations but that they would continue to function underground.     We are advised that it would be no more difficult then than it is at present to keep watch on their activities and they would of course be hampered by not being able to work in the open;    it would also be easier for us in individual cases to expel aliens if they were found to be engaging in activities which their Governments had agreed ought not to be allowed.     In this case also, however,  there might be some unfavourable reactions on our relations with the Governments concerned.7. Such are the main considerations affecting the choice between action and inaction.      It is natural to seek for a via media but we are convinced that in the present circumstances, &quot;one or other of these policies must be definitely chosen.      It would,  in our judgment, be a grave mistake to embark on any representations, however informal, without being prepared to accept their logical consequences .S H8th July.  1927 .A .E .
