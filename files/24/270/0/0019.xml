This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.Printed for the Cabinet. July, 1937SECRETCopy No.45CP. 174 (37).THE cabinet palestine: REPORT OF THE ROYAL COMMISSION, 1936MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WARI circulate herewith, for the information of my colleagues, in connection with the__0176draft statement of policy on the Report of the Royal Commission for Palestine, the     494 following extract from a telegram from the General Officer Commanding the British Forces in Palestine and Trans-Jordan.L. H.-B.The VVak Office,1st July, 1937..Personal telegram from Lieutenant-General J. G. Dill, K.C.B., C.M.G., D.S.O., to the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, dated 29th June, 1937. . . You may like to have my first thoughts on Royal Commission^ report and possible reactions thereto. Recommendations within terms of reference are swamped by wider recommendations. Unnecessary therefore to comment on former except to say, should forcible disarmament be undertaken, reinforcements amounting to 2 Infantry Brigades in addition to troops already earmarked in Egypt would in my opinion be required. By partition offset of Arab gains to losses is likely to dispose Arabs, especially Trans-Jordanians, to favour acceptance. Financial assistance will greatly appeal, also prospects in high offices in new Arab Kingdom likely to induce many if not to support, at least not violently to resist, this solution. Mufti of Jerusalem and his followers, however, stand to lose everything and will consequently be disposed to resist. How far Mufti could carry any other Arabs with him to resist by force of arms impossible to say yet, but by present indications widespread Arab revolt in near future unlikely.In any case, should he succeed in raising rebellion, it is probable that removal of him and his immediate adherents would cause its early collapse. As Arab Kings were brought into Palestine affairs last year, Palestinians likely to look to them again. If Kings and particularly Ibn Saud come down firmly in favour of report, likelihood of serious trouble will be remote. Report so cuts across Zionists&apos; aspirations that Jewish resistance to it will be strenuous. Long-sighted Doctor Weizmann may be willing to accept and bide his time, but if he does he is unlikely to carry world Jewry with him. Although Jewish opposition to report may be frantic, consider it unlikely to take form of armed resistance.   Nevertheless Jewish restraint on reprisals is likely to weaken.To summarize. Report likely to split Arabs, larger proportion being in favour of acceptance while Mufti and dangerous elements being against. Report likely also to split Jewry, larger proportion being against and very few in. favour. Period of discussion among Arabs likely before any armed outbreak, though political assassinations may take place immediately. In event of armed rebellion removal of Mufti likely to cause early collapse. Jews likely to turn every political stone to undermine Report but unlikely to use force. Do not consider any immediate change in strength or disposition of present force necessary.....(b37/8)   70   7/37   w.o.p.   898
