document is the property of His Britannic majesty&apos;s Government)CRETjp. 194 ( 57)Copy Mqg ^-0CABINETMew Government Offices In WhitehallMemorandum hy the First Commissioner of WorkSoThe Cabinet will recollect that on the 10th February 1937 a-pproval was given to the proposal that the new Government building on the Whitehall Gardens site should be proceeded Y/ith, subject to the suspension of this decision until after the Building industry had been approached by the Minister of Labour.? who was asked to report the results of his consultations with the industry to the CabinetoI have been in communication with the Minister of Labour who states that a Joint Consultative Committee.with the Building Trade has been constituted and is meeting regularly, but that it is too early yet to report definite resultso    It appears, howevers that the main consideration underlying these negotiations is to settle ways and means for ensuring that the general.programme of Government Defence Works is carried out expeditiouslyo    It has been assumed3 I understands that this programme should be approaching oom-pletion during 1940, and my Department has, in common with the other Government Building Departments, revised its current civil building programme with the object of postponing any civil works not of immediate urgency in order to assist the progress of the Defence ?/orks programme by reducing the demand on skilled building labouroThe position of the Whitehall Gardens building scheme can, however, be differentiated from the general run of
schemes which are now being delayed.   On the one hands the need for proceeding with the new building has become increasingly urgento   On the other handy a decision to proceed with the building scheme at once does not in fact9 involve any immediate demand upon skilled building labouro   The first stage in the operations is the evacuation of the existing accommodation on the siteo   The Ministry of Transport have9 in fact, already been moved to Metropole Buildings0   The removal of Ministry of Labour staffs to Metropole Buildings is in progress,, but there still remains the removal of the Gabinet Secretariat to Richmond Terraceo   Owing to the time necessary to prepare the alternative accommodation for the reception of the Cabinet Off ices 9 it will not be possibles, even in the most favourable circumstancesj, to commence work on the Whitehall Gardens site before April 19389 even if an immediate decision is given to proceed with the building schemeoThe next step in the operations will be the demolition of the houses oh the site9 which will take some eight months and will not involve the employment of any skilled building labouro   Work on the founc&amp;ions cannots therefore9 commence until December 19386   The amount of skilled building labour required on the site during the ensuing three years is estimated as follows?-BUILDING LABOUR Skilled UnskilledAverage AverageDeoember 1938 &amp;) Foundation (mainlyDecember 1939    )   contract 40     carpenters)   325December 1939 &amp;) Foundation and (mainlyJune9       1940    I   steelwork 85    fcarpenters     340contracts.. land steelCerectorso)June9       1940 &amp;) Steelwork 45    (Steel 15January, 19410 )   contract erectors)After the commencement of the superstructure contract in January 19419 the amount of skilled building labour would.c    g   -a
begin to risej commencing with bricklayers and stonemasons., followed by other skilled trades as the work on the super-structure progresses*It will thus be seen that the Whitehall Gardens building scheme will not begin to make any substantial demand upon the supply of skilled building labour until after the date on which it is assumed that the Defence Works programme will be approaching completions when in all probability there should be an adequate supply of skilled building labour for the execution of the schemeoThe Minister of Labour has had an opportunity of examining the case as presented in this memorandums, and he agrees that the Whitehall Gardens building scheme need not be further delayed on the score of his negotiations with the Building IndustryoI therefore submit that as the scheme is one of high priority^ approval should now be given to a start being made on the scheme without delayoP o S oHo Mo Office of Works &amp;ca 80th July, 1937.
