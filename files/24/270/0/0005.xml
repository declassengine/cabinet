U:l------rC A B I N E T.COMMITTEE ON PART IV OP THE AGRICULTURE BILL.REPORT.1. At their Meeting on Wednesday,  June 16tho,  1937,(Cabinet 24 (37) Conclusion 8) the Cabinet agreed :-(a) That a Cabinet Committee composed as follows  :The Secretary of State for India(In the. Chair;, The President of the Board of Trade, The Minister of Health,with the assistance of The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries, The Secretary of State for Scotland,should examine and advise the Cabinet on the question of principle whether the administration of Part IV of the Agriculture Bill should be entrusted throughout Great Britain to a unified veterinary service,  or in Scotland to the Scottish Department of Agriculture:(b) That the Committee should be asked to report at the next weekly meeting of the Cabinet.2. The Secretary of State for Scotland and the Ministerof Agriculture and Fisheries have explained to us their -respective points of view in amplification of the represent-ations contained in the documents which were before the Cabinet at the Meeting on June 16th.3. We have carefully considered the arguments submittedto us in favour of the two different courses mentioned in (a) of our terms of reference, and we are unanimous in concluding that the scheme embodied in Part IV of the draft Agriculture Bill under which the administration of that Part of the Bill is to be entrusted, throughout Great Britain, to a unified-1-
veterinary service under the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries is a sound one and should he adopted.      With a view, however, to mitigating the oh sections which may quite naturally arise on practical and sentimental grounds in Scotland we suggest that the administration of Part IV of the Bill in Scotland should he entrusted to a senior and experienced official in the veterinary service of the Ministry of Agricul-ture and Fisheries,  who should he permanently stationed in Edinburgh and who should he capahle of dealing with all matters arising in the day to day administration of the service other than those involving questions of policy which would, of course have to he reserved for decision to the Minister in London.Signed on behalf of the Committee ZETLAND, CHAIRMAN.2,  Whitehall Gardens,  S.
