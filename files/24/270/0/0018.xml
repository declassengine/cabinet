Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1937.SECRET. Copy No.CP. 173 (37).CABINET.RETIRED GOVERNMENT SERVANTS.Employment with Business Concerns.Note by the Prime Minister.ARISING out of the report of the Royal Commission on the Private Manufacture of and Trading in Arms, Sir Warren Fisher was instructed by my predecessor to arrange for inter-Service consideration of the question of acceptance of employment with business concerns by retired Officers. I circulate for the consideration of my colleagues the accompanying minute giving the results of that consideration.N. C.10 Downing Street, S.W. 1, June 30, 1937.Prime Minister,I was instructed by your predecessor to arrange for inter-Service considera-tion of the question of Government Servants, civil and military, accepting employment with business concerns (whether on the board, as a partner, or otherwise).2. The following. Officers have accordingly made a joint examination of the subject: Colonel Sir Donald Banks, Sir Archibald Carter, Admiral of the Fleet Lord Chatfield, Sir Herbert Creedy, Field-Marshal Sir Cyril Deverell, Marshal of the Royal Air Force Sir Edward Ellington, Colonel Sir Maurice Hankey, Sir Richard Hopkins, Sir John Maffey, Sir James Rae, Sir Findlater Stewart, Sir Horace Wilson and myself.3. In the case of certain categories of business we recognise that it is desirable, from the point of view of public confidence, that the acceptance of employment by retired Officers of the Crown should be regularised. Such categories would include (a) concerns in contractual relationship with the Government; , (b) concerns in receipt of subsidies or their equivalent from the Government ; \c) concerns in which the Government is a shareholder;(d) concerns in receipt from the Government of loans, guarantees or other forms of capital assistance;(e) concerns with which Services or Departments or Branches of Governmentare as a matter of course in a special relationship;and we would add semi-public organisations brought into being by the Govern-ment and/or by Parliament.[15506]
4. We, therefore, recommend that all Officers of the rank of Assistant Under-Secretary of State (or Principal Assistant Secretary or, in Missions abroad, Ministers), Rear-Admiral, Major-General, Air Vice-^Marshal-^and above should in future be required to obtain the assent of the Government before accepting an offer of employment from concerns such as those illustrated in paragraph 3.In addition, in each of the four Services there are posts of a special or technical character not covered by the preceding sentence to which, in our opinion, a similar requirement should apply. Lists of such posts should be prepared in the respective Departments in conjunction with the Treasury to ensure parity of treatment.We suggest that the prior assent of the Government should take the form of approval by the Ministerial Head of the Department concerned after consulta-tion with the Treasury; and1 that after the lapse of two years from the date of retirement such assent should no longer be required.5. While the majority of cases in which the proposed rule would operate would be those of Officers on retirement at the end of their Service career, it happens from time to time that Officers in the course of their service receive offers of employment from the business world; and we recommend that these Officers shall be subject to the same rule.6. As regards the employment of Crown Officers in concerns outside the categories mentioned in paragraph 3 above (or not ejusclem generis with them), we feel that there is no public ground for introducing any rule. The criterion must be the good taste of the individual Officer; and indeed the existence of standards and traditions in the Crown Services is the surest safeguard of the public interest whatever the kind of private employment that may be the subject of an offer.7. You will remember that in May a White Paper (Cmd. 5451) was published, giving the Governments conclusions arising out of the report of the Royal Commission on the Private Manufacture of, and Trading in, Arms. Paragraph 15, page 8, related to the subject-matter of this minute, and concluded with the statement: &apos;&apos; The matter is, indeed, a branch of a much wider question, not by any means confined to the armaments industry, viz., the question of the acceptance of appointments by Officers of the Crown Services on the termination of their Government service. This larger question calls for careful study, and is not being overlooked.&quot;This White Paper was debated on the 26th May in the House of Commons on the Treasury Vote.We assume that the Government will inform Parliament of the outcome of its investigations into the problem, and we attach accordingly, for consideration, the draft of a White Paper.N. F. W. F.June 2%, 1937.Draft of a White Paper dealing with the question of the acceptance of business appointments by Officers of the Crown Services.As stated at the end of paragraph 15 of Cmd. 5451 (&quot; Statement relating to Report of the Royal Commission on the Private Manufacture of and Trading in Arms, 1935-36 &quot;), the question of the acceptance of business appointments by Officers of the Crown Services is one which &quot; calls for careful study, and is not being overlooked.&quot;After close examination of this question, His Majesty&apos;s Government have reached the conclusions set out in the following paragraphs : . 2. The surest guide for the conduct of Officers of the four Crown Services must always be the existence and maintenance of great traditions and high standards in those Services; no rules, however elaborate, can be a substitute for this all-important condition. The Appendix to this paper contains an extract from the Report of a Board of Enquiry published in 1928 (Cmd. 3037) enunciating certain general principles by which the conduct of Civil Servants should be regulated; these received governmental approval, and are, of course,, equally applicable to the Royal Navy, the Army, and the Royal Air Force.
3. At the same time, His Majesty&apos;s Government recognise that it is in the interest of the Services themselves, as well as;. of the country j that public confidence in the disinterestedness and integrity of the Crown Services should be maintained at the highest point, and that there should be no possibility of: a suggestion-however unjustified-in the public mind that members of those Services might be influenced in the course of their official relations with business concerns by hopes or offers of future employment in any of those concerns.4. In emphasising the importance of preserving public confidence, His Majesty&apos;s Government in no sense imply that there is anything intrinsically improper or undesirable in Officers, on retirement at the end of their Service career, accepting business appointments. But they realise that there are types of case which might lend themselves to misunderstanding, and they have decided to require Government assent to the acceptance of appointments within these types.5.   These would include businesses and other bodies : (a) which are in contractual relationship with the Government;(b) which are in receipt of subsidies or their equivalent from the Government;(c) in which the Government is a shareholder;(d) which are in receipt from the Government of Joans, guarantees or other forms of capital assistance;(e) with which Services or Departments or Branches of Government are, asa matter of course, in a special relationship;and semi-public organisations brought into being by the Government and/or by Parliament.6. In such cases all Officers of the rank of Assistant Under-Secretary of State (or Principal Assistant Secretary or, in Missions abroad, Ministers), Rear-Admiral, Major-General, Air Vice-Marshal and above will be required to obtain the assent of the Government before accepting an offer of employment.In addition, in each of the four Services there are posts of a special or technical character not covered by the preceding sentence to which a similar requirement will apply. Lists of such posts will be prepared in the respective Departments, in conjunction with the Treasury, to ensure parity of treatment.7. The prior assent of the Government will take the form of approval by the Minister concerned after consultation with the Treasury;. but, after the lapse of two years from the date of retirement, such assent will no longer be required.8. The like principles will apply in the case of Officers who, in exceptional circumstances, may wish to resign from the Services to take up outside occupations.APPENDIX.We think in conclusion that we shall not be travelling outside our terms of reference if, as three Civil Servants of some experience and jealous for the honour and traditions of the Service, we indicate what we conceive to be the principles which should regulate the conduct of Civil Servants whether engaged in Home Departments or on diplomatic missions in their relation to the public.His Majesty&apos;s Civil Service, unlike other great professions, is not and cannot in the nature.of things be an autonomous profession. In common with the Royal Navy, the Army, and the Royal Air Force, it must always be subject to the rules and regulations laid down for its guidance by His Majesty&apos;s Government. This written code is, in the case of the Civil Service, to be found not only in the Statutes but also in Orders in Council, Treasury Circulars and other directions, which may from time to time be promulgated; but over and above these the Civil Service, like every other profession, has its unwritten code of ethics and conduct for which the most effective sanction lies in the public opinion of the Service itself, and it is upon the maintenance of a sound and healthy public opinion within the Service that its value and efficiency chiefly depend.The first duty of a Civil Servant is to give his undivided allegiance to the State at all times and on all occasions when the State has a claim upon his services.
&quot;With his private activities the State is in general not concerned, so long as his conduct therein is not such as to bring discredit upon the Service of which he is a member. But to say that he is not to subordinate his duty to his private interests, nor to make use of his official position to further those interests, is to say no more than that he must behave with common honesty. The Service exacts from itself a higher standard, because it recognises that the State is entitled to demand that its servants shall not only be honest in fact, but beyond the reach of suspicion of. dishonesty. It was laid down by one of His Majesty&apos;s Judges in a case some few years ago that it was not merely of some importance, but of fundamental importance, that in a court of law justice should not only be done, but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done; which we take to mean that public confidence in the administration of justice would be shaken if the least suspicion, however ill-founded, were allowed to arise that the course of legal proceedings could in any way be influenced by improper motives. We apply without hesitation an analogous rule to other branches of the public service. A Civil Servant is not to subordinate his duty to his private interests; but neither is he to put himself in a position where his duty and his interests conflict. He is not to make use of his official position to further those interests; but neither is he so to order his private affairs as to allow the suspicion to arise that a trust has been abused or a confidence betrayed. These obligations are, we do not doubt, universally recognised throughout the whole of the Service; if it were otherwise, its public credit would be diminished and its usefulness to the State impaired.We content ourselves with laying down these general principles, which we do not seek to elaborate into any detailed code, if only for the reason that their application must necessarily vary according to the position, the Department and the work of the Civil Servant concerned. Practical rules for the guidance of social conduct depend also as much upon the instinct and perception of the individual as upon cast-iron formulas; and the surest guide will, we hope, always be found in the nice and jealous honour of Civil Servants themselves. The public expects from them a standard of integrity and conduct not only inflexible but fastidious, and has not been disappointed in the past. We are confident that we are expressing the view of the Service when we say that the public have a right to expect that standard, and that it is the duty of the Service to see that the expectation is fulfilled.
