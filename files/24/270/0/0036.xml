SECRET . CoPY No .;- C A B I N E T.CP. 191(37)THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS AND THE STATUS OP WOMEN. Memorandum by the Home Secretary.1. I desire to bring to the notice of the Cabinet a request from the League of Nations for the views of H.M. Government as to the action which the League might take in regard to the question of the political and civil status of women, which is on the Agenda for the next meeting of the Assembly.2. This question came before the Assembly of theLeague in 1935 in connection with a Convention concluded inMontevideo in 1933 by certain South American States, which included a provision to the effect that men and women inthe Contracting States should have equal rights subject tothe respective jurisdictions of those States.     The Assemblyadopted a resolution to the effect, inter alia,  that thequestion should be referred to Governments for their observations, including observations as to the action whichin their view the League might take in this matter, and requested Governments to supply information as to the existingpolitical and civil status of women under their respectivelaws.     Information under the latter heading has already beenfurnished by His Majesty&apos;s Government and the statement hasxbeen circulated to members of the League;    but before submitting a reply as to the action which the League might take, I should be glad to have the views of my colleagues.A oopy of the statement is attached as an Appendix to this memorandum.
3. The Government&apos;s attitude towards the question of introducing legislation to give effect to the principle of equality of the sexes has been the subject of several Questions in the House of Commons in recent years,  including a Question put to me on 1st July, to which I replied thatxthe provisions of the Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act, 1919, generally represented the Government&apos;s position on this que s t i on .4. When the subject came up before the Assembly in1935, the United Kingdom Delegate, in accordance with instructions given on the authority of the then Home Secretary, Sir John Simon, stated that he did not consider that inter-national action by means of a Convention on the lines of the Montevideo Treaty was practicable.     It was one thing for a country to attach importance to a principle and to give effect to it generally as circumstances might permit, but quite another thing to enter into an international obligation and give effect to it on every occasion and in all circumstances.     Every country had its own laws and peculiar circumstances and each must decide for itself how far it could remove existing disabilities.5. The discussion at Geneva disclosed a good deal of difference of opinion on the question of the status of women, both as regards the application of the principle of equality and the further question whether the matter was one which fell within the competence of the League.     Several Delegations, including Switzerland and Italy,  thought thex        Section 1 of the Act declares that a person shall not be disqualified by sex or marriage from the exercise of any public function, or from being appointed to or holding any civil or judicial office or post or from entering any civil profession or vocation ... and a person shall not be exempted by sex or marriage from the liability to serve as a juror.
tut oquestion was one essentially of domestic jurisdiction, and that it was not possible for States to enter into any international obligation to give effect to the principle of equality.6. The question of the nationality of married women,which was the subject of a separate item on the Agenda of the Assembly, was, generally speaking, regarded as not within the scope of the discussion.     Further,  it was decided that the position of women in industries should be dealt with separately from their political and civil status and should be regarded as a matter which fell within the competence of the International Labour Organisation.7. Having regard to the differences of opinion disclosed in the discussion in 1935, it seems most unlikely that the League would be ready to endorse any proposal for the preparation of an international Convention on this subject.     In this connection it is to be noticed that in a communication dated 21st September, 1936, from a Committee of representatives of women&apos;s international organisations to the Secretary-General of the League , it was proposed that certain provisions should be added to the Covenant of the League 11 in order that the interests of women may be better protected under the League and that the League may more truly serve all people of the world&quot;.      The provisions suggested for insertion in the Covenant include an undertaking by members of the League not to deny the right to vote on the ground of sex and to &quot;undertake that in their respective countries there shall be no distinction based on sex in their law and practice regarding nationality&quot; and that &quot;men and women shall have equal rights in all other fields&quot;.8* This far-reaching suggestion gives some indication of the demands which might be made for League action if it
should be decided by the Assembly that the question of the status of women falls within the proper scope of the League&apos;s activities.     It might, for example, lead to requests for international action to enable women to sit in the House of Lords or to secure their unrestricted admission to the Diplomatic Service.     Further,  if the principle of equal rights were adopted without qualification and carried to its logical conclusion - which could not be avoided if we entered into a binding treaty obligation on the lines of the Montevideo Convention of 1933 - it would become necessary before ratification to examine in detail all legislation affecting women directly or indirectly, and it might well become necessary to remove all discriminations in favour of,  as well as against, women married or unmarried.     For example, it might be necessary that any rightss which a deserted ^ife has to maintenance by her husband should be abandoned or, alternatively, that equivalent rights of the maintenance of the husband by the wife should be established.9. The question of the extent to which effect shouldbe given in any State to the principle of equality is a matter for the domestic laws of that State,  and the authority of the League might be gravely jeopardised if the League should endeavour to force States to adopt in the domestic sphere policies which States are, generally speaking, not yet ready to adopt.      I therefore recommend that the reply to the League and the instructions to our Delegation at the Assembly should be based on the vie-mr that the League itself should refrain from expressing any opinions in this matter and should limit itself to encouraging the study of the questions involved by collecting and circulating information or similar methods10* I would emphasize that this view of the scope of theLeague&apos;s activities has no reference to the question of the
Illl&amp;ih. July. 1957.Nationality of Women which has a definite international aspect and has for that reason been made not only the subject of League resolutions but also the subject of a Nationality Convention concluded under League auspices at the Hague Codification Conference of 1930.S .H.
APPENDIX.STATUS   OF   WOMEN   IN   ENGLISH   LAW.His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom, in submitting the following statement as to the existing political and non-politioal status of women under the law of England, desires to point out that its study of the subjeot is not yet complete and that it may be necessary to supplement the information given by a further memorandum in due course. It should also be pointed out that no observations such as are contemplated in paragraph 1 of the Assembly&apos;s Resolution of September 27th, 1935, have yet been prepared.In English law the prinoiple of the equality of the sexes has received wide recognition and effect has been given to that principle in various branches of the law affecting the political and civil (or legal) status of women, married and unmarried.     The following is a summary of the more important legislative provisions.GENERAL PROVISIONS.Eligibility of women for the exeroise of public functions, appointment to oivil and judicial offices and for any profession.The Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act, 1919, deolared the general principle that a person shall not be disqualified by sex or marriage from the exercise of any public function, the holding of oivil or judicial office or the carrying on of any civil profession or from membership of any incorporated society, and shall not be exempted by sex or marriage from liability to serve as a juror.This general prinoiple is qualified, however, by provisions which give power (a) to regulate the mode of admission of women to the Oivil Servioe and the conditions of their servioe, and to reserve to men posts in the Colonial, diplomatic and consular servioes, and (b) to dispense with the presence of men or women on juries in oertain oircumstances. Further particulars of the effeot of these qualifying provisions will be given under appropriate headings below.STATUS OF WOMEN IN POLITICAL MATTERS.(l) Parliamentary and Local Government H^rarrahtse.Women were first admitted to the parliamentary and local government franchise In 1918, though not on the basis of complete equality with men,     In 1928, provision was made by the Representation of the People (Equal Franohise) Act, 1928, of that year for the oomplete assimilation of the franohises of men and women.    Persons of either sex who are of full age (i*e. 21) can accordingly vote at parliamentary and local government eleotions if, having fulfilled the neoessary qualifications as to residence etc., they are registered as electors
t3 2Q(2) Eligibility for Membership of Legislature.(a) House of Lords.The right to sit in the House of Lords of peers so entitled is reoognised by the issue of a Writ of Summons to such peers on the commencement of each new Parliament.     Under the common law a woman is unable to sit in the House of Lords since she is. disqualified from receiving the Writ;   and the Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act has been held not to remove this disqualification.(b) House of Commons.The Parliament (Qualification of Women) Act, 1918, enacted that a woman shall not be disqualified by sex or marriage from being elected to, or sitting, or voting as a member of the House of Commons.(3) Eligibility for membership of Councils of Local Authorities.Women are eligible for membership of Councils of Looal Authorities by reason of the Sex Disqualification (Removal) Aot, 1919. Disqualification by sex or marriage for the office of (a) County or Borough Councillor or Alderman, (b) Urban Distriot Councillor and (c) Parish Councillor had previously been removed by the Qualification of Women (County and Borough Councils) Act, 1907, and section 23(2) and section 3(2) respectively of the Local Government Act, 1894.STATUS IN NON-POLITICAL MATTERS.(l) Unmarried Women.Generally speaking the legal position of an unmarried woman is the same as that of a man0(2) Married^fomen.(a) Acquisition and disposal of property;   liability in respeot of torts, contracts, debts and obligations.A married woman is capable of acquiring, holding and disposing of property and of rendering herself liable in respect of torts, oontracts, debts and obligations and is subjeot to the law relating to bankruptcy and to the enforcement of judgments and orders in all respects as if she were a single woman.     Certain limitations which until recently have existed in these matters were removed by the Law Reform (Married Women and Tortfeasors) Aot, 1935.     Section 125 of the Bankruptcy Aot, 1914, which was repealed by&quot;&quot; the Act of 1935, had previously made a married woman carrying on trade or business subject to the bankruptcy laws as if she were a single woman and had made judgments and orders for sums of money qbtained against her available for bankruptcy proceedings as though she were personally bound to pay the judgment debt or sum.
(b) Domicil.The legal domicil of a married woman follows that of her husband.(c) Divorce.Since 1923 a wife has been able to petition for a dissolution of marriage on the ground of her husband adultery (Matrimonial Causes Act, 1923, repealed and re-enacted in section 176 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act, 1925).Before the Act of 1925 while adultery of the wife was a sufficient ground for divorce by the husband, the adultery of the husband was not in itself a sufficient ground for the wife since she had to prove in addition either desertion or cruelty by her husband before she could obtain the relief of a divorce.(d) Judicial separation, desertion and maintenance.Under section 185 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1925, a petition for judicial separation may be presented to the High Court either by a husband or wife on the ground of adultery, cruelty, desertion without cause for not less than two years or failure to comply with a decree of restitution of conjugal rights.A court of summary jurisdiction may also make a separation order -(l) On the application of a wife whose husband has been guilty of aggravated assault, desertion, persistent cruelty to her or her children, or wilful neglect to maintain her or her children, is an habitual drunkard or drug addict, has insisted on sexual intercourse whilst he is suffering to his knowledge from a venereal disease or has compelled her to submit to prostitution; ,(2) On the application of a husband whose wife is an habitual drunkard or has been guilty of persistent cruelty to his children.(3) Generally.(a) Position of wife and unmarried mother in relation to children.Guardianship.     The Guardianship of Infants Act, 1925, extends to the guardianship of infants the principle of equality in law between the sexes declared by the Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act, 1919.    The Act provides that a court in determining questions relating to the custody, upbringing or the administration of property belonging to an infant shall regard the welfare of the infant as the paramount consideration and shall not take into account whether any claim of either parent in the matter is superior to that of the other.   The mother of an infant is also given the same powers to apply to the court in respect of any matter affecting the infant as are possessed by the father.
(b) Liability for maintenance.     Subseotions (2) and (4) of seotion 14 of the Poor Law Aot, 1930* as amended by the Law Reform (Married Women and Tortfeasors) Act, 1935, place on the mother of an illegitimate child an obligation whilst unmarried or a widow to maintain the child until the age of 16 and render a married woman with property subject to the same liability as her husband for the maintenance of her children.(o) Marriage.     At civil law any woman is oapable of marrying in the same circuinstanoes as a man.The Age of Marriage Act, 1929, renders void any marriage between persons either of whom is under the age of 16.
