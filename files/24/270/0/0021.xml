i-j \JMy colleagues now have &quot;before them the Report of the Special Committee, appointed under the Chairmanship of Sir Warren Fisher, to consider the nature,  scale and distribution of Air Raid Precautions Services.     I agree in general with the Committee&apos;s recommendations.Apart from certain important recommendations as to the incidence of administrative responsibility for Air Raid Precautions Services,  the Committee have reached the following main conclusions:(a) that provision for passive defence must be considered with due regard to other war preparations and the country&apos;s resources in men, material and money:(b) that, whilst it is impossible to provide complete protection against air raids, a reasonable degree of protection can and should be provided:(c) that in assessing the degree of preparation to be made in the various parts of the country,  the primary consideration must be the degree of vulnerability of each separate area and that full regard should be given to this factor in examining schemes submitted by local authorities.It will be observed that the Committee have not dealt in their Report with the following matters which were dealt with in the memorandum on the Financial Aspects of Air Raid Precautions (D.P.R.181) which was placed before the Sub-Committee on DefencejCP.     176(37) Copy No, . .4^&amp;/C A B I N E T . report OF THE WARREN FISHER COMMITTEE ON AIR RAID PRECAUTIONS SERVICES.Memorandum &quot;by the Home Secretary.
1 9^Policy and Requirements by my predecessor on the 23rd March, 1937, and subsequently considered by the Cabinet on the 14th April last.(a) The question of Base Hospital accommodation, which is now under examination by a special Sub-Committee appointed by the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence.(b) The proposal to make Exchequer grants towards expenditure incurred on Air Raid Precautions by the so-called &quot;Vital Services&quot; (water, power and light, transport, oil), which has been referred to a Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence .(c) The proposal to make Exchequer grants towards the cost of providing sandbags, with regard&quot;to which it has now been agreed by the Defence Policy and Requirements Sub-Committee to authorise the Air Raid Precautions Department to enter into negotiations for the purchase of approximately 40,000,000 sandbags within the next six months as the first instalment of a six years programme.(d) The measures already approved for the accumulation at Government expense of respirators, bleach powder, etc. The cost of these measures is estimated, at approximately  8,000,000, of which approximately  5,000,000 willhave been incurred by the end of the present financial year.As regards expenditure on services within the sphere of local authorities, which are referred to in detail at the end of the Committee&apos;s Report, the Committee recommend that the proposals which have been made under this head should be accepted in principle as representing the deficiency programme of the
Air Raid Precautions Organisation.     In this connexion my . colleagues should note that hy far the greater part of the expenditure is capital expenditure and that the recurring cost is estimated at  1,300,000 a year, of which, on the &quot;basis of a 60% grant,  the Exchequer share would be  780,000.     The Committee do not make any positive recommendation as to the basis on which grants should be made from the Exchequer towards the expenditure involved in these Services - no doubt for the reason that any such recommendation would have been somewhat beyond their competence.     I hope nevertheless that the Cabinet may be willing at their meeting next Wednesday to reach such decisions as will make it possible for us to enter into immediate negotiations with the various organisations representing local authorities throughout the country.For this purpose, I do not suggest that the Cabinet, at this stage, should commit themselves to the specific, and admittedly speculative, estimates of expenditure on local authorities&apos; schemes given in Appendix I to the Committee&apos;s Report.      This question is of course bound to be raised as soon as we get into consultation with the representatives of local authorities, and we cannot say in reply that we have no idea what the order of expenditure on such services may be.     But it would be enough for the present to make a quite general statement to the effect that any precise estimate of the total amount of expenditure likely to be incurred under each of the various categories of local authority expenditure (including expenditure in money or kind on fire appliances) is at present impossible, but that it might be assumed that the total liability, apart from the expenditure in respect of respirators,  etc., for which the Government was making itself wholly responsible, might be of the order of 10 to 15 million pounds.     This, I think, without
8 1L 9committing the Government, would be sufficient to enable the local authorities to come to grips with us on the question of Exchequer grants-in-aid.     I hope therefore that the Cabinet may be prepared to reach a decision on this basis and of course on the understanding that every effort will be made by the Home Office, when the time comes for detailed examination of specific schemes, to pare down to the utmost degree possible the expenditure involved.Similarly, I trust that my colleagues will be willing to authorise the Departments concerned to enter into negotiations with representatives of the local authority organisations on the footing that they will be at liberty to offer grants-in-aid (whether in money or in kind) within a limit of 60 per cent, of the total cost involved.     I should contemplate that the negotiations would start by attempting to agree on a lower basis, say,  50%.     This limit falls somewhat short of the scheme of Government assistance proposed in D.P.R. 181.     But I think it may be possible to reach agreement on the basis of 60% and that, in any event, it would be right to bring the matter again before the Cabinet before making any more generous offer.I doubt whether any final settlement can be reached by the end of this month;    but I feel that if we can go as far in discussion with the local authorities as I now suggest, we should at any rate succeed in making them believe that the Government are prepared to go a long way towards meeting the cost of local authorities&apos; schemes at the expense of the taxpayer and that many, if not all, loqal. authorities would be ready on this understanding to go ahead with their schemes.What is urgently necessary is a decision at the next meeting of the Cabinet which would enable us to arrange a
3rd July, 1937.preliminary conference with representatives of local authorities without delay.     Postponement of the whole matter, even for a few months,  could not fail to react disastrously on the whole scheme of passive defence.I would emphasize that,  if it is not possible for the negotiations with the local authorities&apos; associations to start by the middle of July, the Government will he faced with a position of great difficulty.     Apart from the risk of agitation developing among the local authorities on a scale which will make ultimate agreement on any basis acceptable to the Government much less likely of attainment,  it is being brought home to me almost every day that the House of Commons is expecting some announcement of policy and the Government will be exposed to severe criticism if an announcement is delayed much longer.S.H.
