THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   June 1937.SECRET. Copy No.   4CP. 156 (37).CABINET.CEYLON:   THE BRACEGIRDLE CASE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.Mr. BRACEGIRDLE, born in Australia, where he was, under the name of Price, an active member of the Young Communist League of Australia, came to Ceylon in 1936 as a tea-planting pupil. His employer found him unsuitable and provided him with a passage back to Australia, of which, however, Mr. Bracegirdle did not avail himself, preferring to remain in the Island in association with the local Communist party, which is small in numbers but includes some young men of wealth. His subsequent activities took the form of violent speeches, abusing Europeans, and inciting labourers to rise against the planters, and the Governor, considering that he was a public danger, ordered him to leave Ceylon. He declined to do so, and was eventually arrested so that the deportation order might be carried out.2. The Governor&apos;s order was made under Clause III (3) of an Order-in-Council passed in 1896 and applicable to a group of Colonies, of which Ceylon was one. The Order provides that it shall have effect in all or any of the Colonies specified in which it shall be proclaimed by the Governor of the Colony, and shall come into operation on being so proclaimed, and shall continue in operation until the Governor shall by proclamation declare that it has ceased to be in operation. The Order confers upon the Governor a number of drastic powers which may be likened in small measure to the powers conferred by the Defence of the Realm Acts in this country. The Order was intended for use in case of war, or any grave local emergency, and it was, in fact, brought into force in Ceylon upon the outbreak of the last war. So far as Ceylon is concerned, no proclamation has ever been made declaring that the Order-in-Council has ceased to be in operation there.3. The question of the retention in force of the Order was discussed with the Governor of Ceylon in 1924. Copies of the relevant correspondence are appended.4: The Order was allowed to remain in force in Ceylon, though it had been withdrawn in other Colonies, advisedly, and chiefly for the purpose of excluding and deporting undesirable persons, it being considered that such powers were necessary in view of the Island&apos;s proximity to India. (The Government of India supported fully the retention of these powers in Ceylon.) It must be mentioned also that in 1928, when a new &quot; defence &quot; Order-in-Council was enacted to take the place of the 1896 Order, the then Secretary of &quot;State addressed the Governor of Ceylon in the following terms :  &quot; The Order-in-Council of the 17th May, 1928, of which copies are now supplied, does not come into force in the Colony until proclaimed, and, until it is brought into operation by proclamation it does not operate to repeal the earlier Order, which, therefore, remains in force. So long as that position remains undisturbed, there would be no objection to the Governor, if occasion should arise, taking action in a minor matter under the powers conferred by the 1896 Order. . . .[15377] b   ...
5. In 1931 Ceylon was granted a Constitution which amounted to a form of self-government with certain reservations. The Constitution did not have the effect of repealing the Order-in-Council of 1896, and no steps were taken even then to withdraw it.6. A writ of Habeas Corpus having been applied for on behalf of Mr. Bracegirdle, the Supreme Court of Ceylon ruled that the order of deportation was ultra vires on the broad grounds that the powers given under the Order-in-Council in question could only be used in a state of emergency, and that no such state had been declared to exist. The Governor, before making the order of deportation, had consulted his Attorney-General (a Ceylonese), who stated that, in his opinion, it might properly be issued; but the Legal Secretary (a British officer) now advises that he agrees with the Judgment of the Supreme Court, and considers that an appeal against it to the Privy Council would be unsuccessful. It is understood that Mr. Bracegirdle is now considering instituting civil proceedings in the Courts against the Governor personally, claiming damages presumably for false imprisonment; and the Governor asks that a special new Order-in-Council, indemnifying him and the other Officers concerned in the case, should be proceeded with immediately.7. The attitude in the matter of the Ceylon State Council (which is the elected legislative assembly of the Colony under the Constitution of 1931) is indicated by the following Resolution, which was carried by 34 votes to 7 :-&apos;&apos; His Excellency the Governor, by ordering the deportation of Mr. Bracegirdle without the advice of the Acting Minister of Home Affairs, or, in the alternative, without declaring a state of emergency and taking control of the affairs of the Police Department and other Departments concerned, under section 49, sub-section (1), of the Ceylon (State Council) Order-in-Council, dated the 20th March, 1931, has violated the Constitution and the express conditions of his appointment; wherefore this House requests the Board of Ministers to advise His Excellency to rescind the Order dated the 20th April, 1937, and further to take steps for the repeal of the Orders-in-Council under which His Excellency has acted.&quot;8. It may be added that the views of Sir Baron Jayatilaka, the Minister for Home Affairs in the Ceylon State Council, who is at present in this country, have been obtained. He states that, while agreeing that Mr. Bracegirdle is undesirable, he regards it as very regrettable that the Governor should have had recourse to the 1896 Order-in-Council, and considers that the Attorney-General&apos;s advice was wrong. He is, however, in favour of the issue of an indemnity Order-in-Council, since he thinks that it is most undesirable that the Governor should be compelled to defend himself in any action brought in the Courts of Ceylon by Mr. Bracegirdle.9. To sum up : it may well be held that the Goveimor&apos;s action in attempting to use the powers given by the 1896 Order-in-Council was politically unwise. The attitude taken up by Ceylon Ministers and by the State Council was only what might have been expected, particularly as certain individuals among them had been, under the powers conferred by the Order, arrested and detained on suspicion of complicity in the riots which occurred in Ceylon in 1915. (They were released without charges being preferred against them; and their treatment has coloured their attitude towards the British Government ever since.) On the other hand, the Communist party in Ceylon is small and unimportant, and Ministers have no sympathy with it. It is arguable that, as the Governor was legally advised that he could use the Order in the Bracegirdle case, he was under no obligation to consult Ministers before so acting.10. But, whatever the propriety or otherwise of the Governors action, it was taken in good faith, and in reliance not only on the advice of the Attorney-General, but also on the views expressed in 1926 by a previous Secretary of State; and in these circumstances it is very undesirable that the Governor should be exposed to an action in the Courts at the instance of a man whose proceedings in Ceylon had justified the use against him of any legal powers which the Governor possessed.11. On the other hand, to pass an Order-in-Council over the head of the Ceylon legislature for the purpose of depriving an individual of such legal rights
as he may have in relation to a wrong which he has suffered, would be a very strong step; and it may well be held that the proper constitutional course would be for the Governor to invite the local legislature to pass a measure providing such indemnity as may be required. I ought to add, however, that the Governor doubts the willingness of the State Council to pass such a measure under the circumstances.12. Having regard to the decision of the Supreme Court, I propose to instruct the Governor formally to declare that the Order-in-Council of 1896 has ceased to be in operation in Ceylon. In the event of any emergency arising, recourse will be had to the Order-in-Council of 1928, I propose also to consider the possibility of passing fresh legislation in the Ceylon State Council to provide for the deportation of British subjects in proper circumstances.13.

G.Colonial Office, Downing Street, June 10, 1937.APPENDIX.(1)Confidential Despatch from the Governor of Ceylon to the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies, May 14, 1924.(Confidential.)Sir, Ceylon, May 14, 1924.I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your Confidential despatch of the 1st March, 1924, with which you transmitted a copy of a question asked in the House of Commons, and of the Reply thereto, on the subject of the retention in operation in this Colony of the Order in Council of the 26th October, 1896.2. I would point out that, apart from the special action taken by this Government in the matter of the food supply of the Island when a crisis arose some time ago, the occasions on which the powers under this Order in Council have been used since the termination of the war are only nine in number, as will be seen on reference to the accompanying statement. It must, however, at the same time be mentioned that it is clear that, placed as Ceylon is on the main route to the Far East and Australia and so close to India, many more undesirable characters would have appeared in the Colony but for the existence of these powers, which, I would observe, have in all instances been brought into operation only after the most careful consideration of the facts of each case.   For instance,[15377] b 2
in the case of Shaukat Ali and his associates, they were allowed to land in Ceylon because, although known to.be seditionists and extremists in India, they were able to advance an innocent reason for their proposed visit to the Colony. It is true that to&apos; some extent they abused; the hospitality shown them, and this abuse shows that this Government would, in fact have been justified had permission been refused to these persons to come to Ceylon. But it still more clearly shows the spirit in which the Government uses these powers, and that their retention, while being in the general public interest, does not in practice work hardship on any one.3. The Order in Council provides the only means whereby the Government can keep out or expel (as the case may be) undesirable characters other than those engaged in the white slave traffic who are possessed of means of support, since under the ordinary law of the Colony only such persons as are actually destitute or are engaged in vice can be prevented from entering Ceylon. There is always the possibility &quot;that if an undesirable person from a political point of view were allowed to enter the Colony, he might be invited by some local agitator to remain here and deliver speeches in public.4. The Government of India realises the importance of the position of Ceylon geographically, and relies on the Government of this Colony to co-operate in endeavouring to keep undesirables out of India. I would refer in this connection to Viscount Milner&apos;s Circular despatch of the 12th April, 1920. As you are no doubt aware, in India there is a considerable amount of special legislation enabling the authorities to deal summarily with undesirables; but the Government of Ceylon would, but for the Order in Council, be seriously handicapped in this respect, since it would be dependent entirely on the Penal Code and the statutory law, which would be of little help in dealing promptly with the undesirable who is not a destitute, inasmuch as the person concerned could only be dealt with after he had made seditious speeches. Section 120 of the Penal Code provides a penalty for persons who may happen to make such speeches in public; but prosecutions under that section require the special sanction of the Attorney-General, and a very complete case would have to be made out, showing that the person repeated the same expressions in different speeches at various places, before he could in any way be restrained. In the meantime, harm would have been caused, and would be still more aggravated by the advertisement which would be given to the undesirable and by his speech at the necessary public trial in the Supreme Court of the Island.5. &quot;With India in its present condition, and having regard to the general unsettled state of the East and the Far East, it would, in my opinion, not be wise to leave this Government without any power as regards undesirables with the exception of that granted by section 120 of the Penal Code, and therefore it would appear to be necessary that the Order in Council should continue to remain in force. I think it can most certainly be stated that the large majority of the people of this country appreciate the fact that at present it is possible for an undesirable person to be kept out of Ceylon or to be ordered to quit the Colony, and, further, that the people as a body do not wish that undesirables from other parts of the world should come here and stir up disaffection and unrest, and I am of opinion that the question asked in the House of Commons was probably prompted by certain of the Extremist Members of that practically moribund body, the so-called &quot; National Congress,&quot; certain of whom are likewise members of the Legislative Council.6. I take this opportunity of referring to the first of the resolutions passed at the last sessions of the Ceylon National Congress (see my despatch No. 228 of the 31st March last). In that resolution the phrase &quot;the powers vested in the Governor by the Defence of the Realm Act&quot; has reference to the Governors special powers under the Order in Council, which formed the subject of a question asked at a meeting of the Legislative Council held on the 16th June, 1922. I enclose a copy of this question and of the reply made to it.7. It is in my opinion undoubtedly necessary that the Governor should continue to have these special powers, to be exercised whenever an emergency arises, e.g., it may be found necessary to keep some particular undesirable out of the Colony, or another crisis in the matter of the food supply of the Island might have to deal with, and so on.  The statement in the resolution that no necessity for
the retention of these powers exists at the present time cannot be regarded as a convincing argument for the withdrawal of the Order in Council and the regula-tions made thereunder, since it is of course impossible to say when an emergency will arise in the future.I have, &amp;c,W.

He had been convicted twice in Bombay for cheating, and had served a sentence of seven months&apos; rigorous imprisonment. He had been convicted in Allahabad of cheating and sentenced to six months&apos; rigorous imprisonment. He had stolen clothes from a Nursing Sister at Naini Tal. He had masqueraded as a Lieutenant in the Australian Forces. The Indian Police described him as a thief, cheat and plausible liar. It was most undesirable that a man of his type should be at large in Ceylon.He requested permission to visit Ceylon to see his father, who wras a resident in Ceylon. At the outbreak of war he was resident in Batavia. He then wrote letters to his relations in Ceylon which were violently anti-British and extremely pro-German. He later developed pro-Bolshevist sympathies. Per-mission to visit Ceylon was accordingly refused. Later, however, as his views had become more temperate he was on two occasions allowed to pay short visits to his father.Marrott arrived in Ceylon on 27.4.19 on the s.s. Dilwara as a stowaway under the name B. H. Eochanawalla. He was sentenced to three weeks&apos; imprisonment therefor, on his release he went to Madras. There he gave his name at different times as Marrott, Teharanshin, Yoskikawallah and Poch Khana-wallah, and his nationality, as it suited his convenience, as a Parsee, a Persian, a Cali-fornian and an American. He spoke with a German American accent. He was altogether a most suspicious and undesirable character. He was ordered by the Madras Government to return to Ceylon on 5.7.19. It was for the above reasons considered necessary to order him to leave Ceylon.He was an American who arrived in Ceylon on the Dilwara. From information given by his fellow-passengers, there were strong grounds for suspecting that  he  was  a  Bolshevist

When questioned by the Police he declined to answer many questions and to give any information as to his reasons for coming to Ceylon. On the day he landed he assaulted a cashier in the Galleface Hotel-He could give no references and was obviously in Ceylon for no good purpose.She was a Bussian by birth, married to an Englishman, but living separated from him. After her arrival in Ceylon she was constantly seen in the company of two or three sailors while under the influence of liquor. On two-occasions she was seen wandering about the public streets drunk and indecently dressed. She was a disgrace to the European eom-munity in Ceylon and was here for no good purpose.Prior to his arrival in Ceylon he had been con-cerned in Civil disorders in other parts of the Empire. He wrote requesting permission to-pay a short visit to Ceylon, giving a guarantee that his visit would be short and that the sole object of it was to enable his family to see the places of interest in the Island. He was granted permission accordingly. His motive in coming to Ceylon was before long&quot; open to doubt as after he landed he visited none of the places of interest in Ceylon, but settled down in Colombo and announced his intention of practising as an Advocate. After he had been in Ceylon for three months he was requested to state when his visit was likely to come to an end. He replied that he intended to stay for some time. He was known to have been in touch with some of the Indian Extremists. On account of these facts it was considered a necessary precau-tion in view of the impending visit of H.B.H. the Prince of Wales to order Dr. Manilal to leave Ceylon.He was an active Non-co-operator. He came to Ceylon on 28.6.23 and lectured to large crowds of natives on Civil disobedience, non-co-operation and boycott of British Cloth. His influence was such that many natives pulled off their clothes of British manufac-tiire and burned them on the spot. He was a decidedly dangerous man who indulged in venomous remarks against the British Government with a view to exciting feelings of disaffection against Government.He, too, came from India to Ceylon and stayed for two months before being ordered to quit the Island. He, too, like Sunderampillai, convened and addressed public meetings-here. He was even more violent in his speeches than Sunderampillai. In a speech delivered in Colombo to a large crowd of natives he said &quot; you must follow non-co-operation. We can easily di&apos;ive away the whites from this place like cotton before the wind. All Englishmen are liars. Every year they collect six millions of rupees to provide arms and ammunition to annihilate you. By non-co-operation we can starve these whites. Do not pay taxes. Defy the law and disobey Government.&quot; In view of such pernicious activities his early dejfarture was clearly necessary.
Order in Council.The Hon. Mr. E. W. Perera (Western Province &quot; B &quot;) : I rise to ask, Sir, whether the Order in Council dated the 26th October, 1896, and proclaimed in Ceylon on the 5th August, 1914, subjecting the inhabitants to military law under, the Army Act, empowering the Governor to order any person to quit the Colony or to have him arrested and deported, and otherwise curtailing the liberty of the subject, has been withdrawn. If not, what is the reason for its continuance now that the war has terminated ? The Hon. the Acting Colonial Secretary : The powers created and conferred by the Order in Council were not designed solely to meet conditions and contingencies which may arise during the continu-ance of hostilities. The Order has been so framed as to admit of its being continued in operation during the cessation of active hostilities, and thereafter until it was felt that abnormal conditions had completely passed away and there was no reason to apprehend that such emergencies as are contemplated by the Order would arise.After the cessation of active hostilities with Germany, this Colony was suddenly faced with a grave emergency the problem of feeding the people. The existence of the powers created by the Order in Council enabled Government, not only to deal with this grave emergency, but to establish that system of rice control which ensured to the people an equitable distribution of rice at a regulated price. Government was, in pursuance of these powers, able to frame and carry into execution rules relating to the control and distribution of foodstuffs and the encouragement of the production of foodstuffs. This is one instance of the benefits that we have derived from the existence of the Order in Council. It is, therefore, of the very greatest importance that these powers should not be lost to Govern-ment, so long as there is any ground for apprehension that a similar emergency or emergencies of any other character may arise which cannot be adequately dealt with otherwise.Having regard to the condition on the Continent of Europe and elsewhere  political, industrial and economic I am not satisfied that the time has come when Government can with due regard to the best interest of this Colony divest itself of powers which have proved beneficial in the past, and have contributed to the peace and tranquility and relative prosperity of the people.Confidential Despatch from the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the Governor of Ceylon, November 10, 1924.(Confidential.)Sir, Downing Street, November 10, 1924.I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your Confidential despatch of the 14th May, on the subject of the retention in operation in Ceylon of the Order in Council of the 26th October, 1896.2. In view of the considerations which you put forward in your despatch, and after consultation with the Secretary of State for India, I approve of the retention in operation for the present of this Order in Council.3. I enclose for your information copies of correspondence with the India Office in the matter.I have, &amp;c.L. S. AMERY.Governor,Sir William H. Manning, G.C.M.G., K.B.E., C.B., &amp;c, &amp;c, &amp;c.
26380/24.Sir, Downing Street, June 28, 1924.I am directed by Mr. Secretary Thomas to inform you that he has had under his consideration the question of the retention in operation in Ceylon of the Order in Council of the 26th October, 1896, which was put into force in a number of Colonies during the War. The Governor has justified the retention in operation of the Order in Council (apart from its use in connection with, a recent crisis in the food supply of the Island) on the ground that, placed as Ceylon is on the main route to the Far East and Australia and so close to India, many more undesirable characters would have appeared in the Colony but for the existence of the powers given by Clause 3 of the Order in Council, which, he observes, have in all instances been put into operation only after the most careful consideration of the facts of each case. A copy of Clause 3 of the Order in Council is attached for convenience of reference.2. The Governor states that the Order in Council provides the only means whereby the Government can keep out or expel (as the case may be) undesirable characters other than those engaged in the White Slave Traffic, for whom special provision exists in the ordinary law who are possessed of means of support. He adds that the Government of India realises the importance of the position of Ceylon geographically, and relies on the Government of Ceylon to co-operate in endeavouring to keep undesirables out of India.3. In order to assist him in considering this question Mr. Thomas will be obliged if Lord Olivier will inform him what similar powers are retained in force by the Government of India and whether the Government of India attach importance to the retention of such powers in Ceylon.I am, &amp;c.H. j. READ.The Under-Secretary of State, India Office.P. &apos;&amp; j. 2662/24. India Office, Whitehall,Sir, London, July 19, 1924.With reference to Sir H. j. Read&apos;s letter No. 26380, dated the 28th ultimo, on the subject of the retention in operation in Ceylon of the Order in Council of the 26th October, 1896, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to state that Governments in India do not possess powers of such wide scope as those which have been conferred on the Governors of certain Colonies by clause 3 of that Order in Council.I am, however, to invite the attention of the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the under-mentioned Acts and Regulations, in virtue of which the Government of India and local&apos;Governments possess certain limited powers of a similar nature :  (1) The Bengal Regulation III of 1818 (there are similar Regulations forMadras and Bombay). (2) The Foreigners Act, 1864. (3) The European Vagrancy Act, 1874. (4) The Indian Passport Act, 1920.The Secretary of State for India is not aware whether the Government of India attach importance to the retention by the Governor of Ceylon of the powers conferred by Section 3 of the Order in Council of the 26th October, 1896, but is causing a copy of Sir H. j. Read&apos;s letter to be transmitted to that Government for consideration.A further communication will be made to you on receipt of the Government of India&apos;s reply.I have, &amp;c.(Signed)The Under-Secretary of State, .

P. &amp; J. 3536/1924. India Office, Whitehall,Sir, London, October 6, 1924.With reference to my letter P. &amp; J. 2662, dated the 19th July last, on the question of the retention in operation in Ceylon of Clause 3 of the Order in Council of the 26th October, 1896, I am dire,cited by Secretary Lord Olivier to enclose for the information of Mr. Secretary Thomas copy of a letter* in which the Government of India express the opinion that it is desirable that the clause should be retained if no other means of expulsion of a person from Ceylon is available under the ordinary law of that Colony.Lord Olivier concurs in the view of the Government of India.I am, &amp;c.F.

Subject: Retention in operation in Ceylon of the Order in Council ofOctober 26, 1896.Sir,In reply to your letter No. P. &amp; J. 2662/1924, dated the 19th July, 1924, on the subject mentioned above, I am directed to state that the question whether the retention in operation in Ceylon of the Order in Council of the 26th October, 1896, is of interest to the Government of India, depends on whether the Government of Ceylon have powers under the ordinary law like those enjoyed by the Govern-ment of India by virtue of the enactments mentioned in your letter of the 19th July to the Colonial Office. There have been several cases recently in which foreigners have been deported from India to Ceylon and it would obviously place that Government at disadvantage if they were not similarly empowered in converse cases. The Government of India are unable to cite an instance of the use of the powers in question, though it is likely that such cases have occurred; but in their opinion, it is desirable that clause 3 of the Order in Council should be retained if no other means of expulsion of a person from the Colonf is available.I have, &amp;c.J. CRERAR. Secretary to the Government of India.(3)Secret Despatch from the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the Governor of ceylon, July 27, 1928.Sir, Downing Street, July 27, 1928.I have the honour to transmit to you copies of an Order of the King in Council, which was passed on the 7th May, 1928, to make provision for the security of certain British Colonies.2. I have to state that it is very desirable that the Order-in-Council should be kept secret until such time as an emergency may arise in which it would be necessary, with the approval of the Secretary of State, for it to be proclaimed by the Governor of any Colony to which it applies.3- You will observe that it supersedes the Order in Council of the 26th October, 1896, and the amending Orders enumerated in the second schedule, the provisions of which are consolidated and amended.4. In this connection, I have to refer to my Confidential despatch of the 10th November, 1924, and previous correspondence in regard to the retention in operation in Ceylon of the Order-in-Council of the 26th October, 1896.    The[15377] c
Order-in-Council of the 17th May, 1928, of which copies are now supplied, does not come into force in the Colony until proclaimed, and until it is brought into operation by proclamation it does not operate to repeal the earlier Order, which, therefore, remains in force. So long as that position remains undisturbed, there would be no objection to the Governor, if occasion should arise, taking action in a minor matter under the powers conferred by the 1926 (? 1896) Order; but I am advised that, in the event of a serious emergency of the kind which the new Order is designed to meet, it is very doubtful whether it would be proper for . the Governor to rely on the powers derived from the earlier Order, which, though remaining in force in Ceylon, is rendered obsolete by the new Order-in-Council. I sincerely trust that no such emergency may arise, but if it should you will no doubt refer to me by telegraph before proclaiming the new Order-in-Council, unless the need is too urgent to admit of the consequent delay.I have, &amp;c.L.

Person named is English-born in Australia, who, under the name of Price, was active member of Young Communist League of Australia. He came here as a tea-planting pupil, but was found unsuitable and given passage to Australia, but preferred to stay here, sponging on small local Communist party, which is run by young men with more money than brains. He went about the country making violent speeches, abusing Europeans and inciting labourers to rise against the planters. As the ignorance of the coolies tends still to attach importance to speeches of white men, the police and I considered him a public danger, and I ordered him to leave Ceylon. He declined to do so and remained hiding under the protection of the Communists. He re-emerged to make a violent speech and, after some unavoidable delay, was arrested in order that order of deportation might be carried out. Communists have applied for Habeas Corpus on the grounds that my order is ultra vires, and the case is now being considered by full Court.Tell Jayatilaka that I am receiving from all sides warnings of growth of Communist opinions amongst the labouring classes and peasantry, and that I consider that we can no longer afford to regard with amused contempt the antics of the local Communists, but must take drastic steps in order to avoid danger of disturbances.

Jayatilaka understands that question was raised in State Council and that Ministers voted on resolution. Please report briefly by telegram on debate.Telegram from the Governor of Ceylon to the Secretary of State.Dated 15th May, 1937.(Received 1 - 21 p.m. 15th May, 1937.)No. 98.   Confidential.Your telegram of 14th May, No. 115.Following resolution was moved by Samarakoddy and carried by 34 to 7, all Ministers voting in favour of it: &quot; His Excellency the Governor, by ordering deportation of Mr. Bracegirdle without advice of Acting Minister of Home Affairs or, in the alternative, without declaring a state of emergency and taking control of affairs of Police Depart-ment and other departments concerned, under Section 49, sub-section (1), of Ceylon (State Council) Order in Council, dated 20th March, 1931, has violated Constitution and express conditions of his appointment; wherefore this House requests Board of Ministers to advise His Excellency to rescind the Order dated 20th April, 1937, and further to take steps for repeal of Order in Council under which His Excellency has acted.&quot;Speeches were mostly directed to attack on existence of Order in Council and use of it when no emergency existed. Senanayabe took a prominent part because of his recollection of 1915, when he was imprisoned under that Order, and also because it gave him an opportunity of attacking officers of State and Governor&apos;s Special Powers. Some other members use opportunity for attack on Europeans, especially planting community, but most speakers merely talked at large about liberty of the subject.(8)Telegram from the Governor of Ceylon to the Secretary of State.Dated 18th May, 1937.

(9)Telegram from the Governor of Ceylon to the Secretary of State.Dated 20th May, 1937.(Received 4-15 p.m. 20th May, 1937.) No. 102.   Confidential.My telegram of the 18th May, No. 101. Legal Secretary advises that an appeal&apos; to the Privy Council &quot;against the judgment of the Supreme Court would be unsuccessful. I understand that Bracegirdle intends to institute civil proceedings in the courts against me personally claiming damages. As my action was taken bona fide in the belief that Order in Council could be applied, I submit that the case is one for indemnity. The State Council would be most unlikely to pass an Indemnity Ordinance, and I would ask that Order in Council in terms of draft set out below should be enacted as soon as possible. Relevant provision of suggested Order in Council follows Section 3 of Nigerian Ordinance No. 15 of 1931.Draft Order in Council:  Begins: Whereas Her late Majesty Queen Victoria by and with the advice of Her Privy Council was pleased to make an Order in Council on the twenty-sixth day of October, 1896 :And whereas by Article 1 of the said Order in Council it is provided that the Order shall apply to and have effect in all or any of the Colonies specified in the schedule thereto in which it shall be proclaimed by the Governor of the Colony, and shall come into operation in each such Colony on being proclaimed therein and shall continue in operation therein until the Governor shall by Proclamation declare that it has ceased to be in operation therein :And whereas the said Order in Council was proclaimed by the Governor of Ceylon in our Island of Ceylon on the fifth day of August, 1914, by Proclamation published in the Ceylon Government Gazette No. 6638 of the same date :And whereas after the date of the Proclamation of the said Order in Council no further Proclamation has been issued declaring the said Order in Council has ceased to be in operation in the Island of Ceylon :And&apos; whereas by Clause 3 of Article 3 of the said Order in Council it is provided that the Governor may order any person to quit the Colony or any part of or place in the Colony, to be specified in such Order, and if any person shall refuse to obey any such Order, the Governor may cause him to be arrested and removed from the Colony, or from such part thereof, or place therein, and for that purpose to be placed on board of any ship or boat:And whereas in pursuance or supposed pursuance of the powers in him vested by the said Clause 3 of Article 3 of the said Order in Council, Reginald Edward Stubbs, Governor and Commander-in-Chief in and over the Island of Ceylon and the Territories and Dependencies thereof, did on the twentieth day of April, 1937, make Order that one Mark Anthony Lyster Bracegirdle should quit the Island of Ceylon on or before 6 p.m. on the twenty-fourth day of April, 1937 :And whereas the said Mark Anthony Lyster Bracegirdle failed and refused to obey the said Order of the Governor :And whereas in pursuance or supposed pursuance of the powers in him vested by the said Clause 3 of Article 3 of the said Order in Council the said Reginald Edward Stubbs did on the seventh day of May, 1937, order the arrest of the said Mark Anthony Lyster Bracegirdle :And whereas the said Mark Anthony Lyster Bracegirdle was on the seventh day of May, 1937, arrested in pursuance of the said Order of Arrest and taken into custody and detained by the Deputy Inspector-General of Police (Criminal Investigation Department) of Ceylon :And whereas an application was made to the Supreme Court of Ceylon for a writ of Habeas Corpus on the said Deputy Inspector-General of Police for production of the body of Mark Anthony Lyster Bracegirdle :And whereas in pursuance of a mandate issued by the Supreme Court, dated the eighth day of May, 1937, the. body of the said Mark Anthony Lyster Brace-girdle was produced before the Supreme Court on the tenth day of May, 1937 :
(10)Paraphrase Telegram from the Secretary of State to the Governor of Ceylon.(Sent 3 p.m. 24th Mav, 1937.)No. 118.   Secret.Your confidential telegram No. 102. I see difficulty in approving indemnity Order in Council. Please, telegraph summary of reasons for Supreme Court judg-ment and grounds for opinion that appeal would not be successful.And whereas by its judgment delivered on the eighteenth day of May, 1937, the Supreme Court held that the Orders of the Governor under Clause 3 of Article 3 of the said Order in Council were made without authority and that the arrest and the detention of the said Mark Anthony Lyster Bracegirdle were illegal, and directed that he should be released from custody in which he was then detained :And whereas by Article 72 of the Ceylon (State Council) Order in Council, 1931, His Majesty reserved to himself, his heirs and successors, with the advice of his or their Privy Council, to make from time to time all such laws as may appear necessary for the peace, order and good Government of the Island of Ceylon :And whereas it is expedient by Order in Council to indemnify the said Reginald Edward Stubbs, and the Deputy Inspector-General of Police, and all other persons concerned in respect of all acts done in pursuance or supposed pursuance of the powers conferred by the said Order in Council and in respect of the arrest and detention in custody of the said Mark Anthony Lyster Bracegirdle:Now, therefore, it is hereby ordered by His Majesty, by and with the advice of his Privy Council, as follows :  Short title, publication and commencement.1. This Order may be cited as the Ceylon Indemnity Order in Council, 1937. It shall be published in the Ceylon Government Gazettee, and shall come into operation on the date of such publication.Indemnification of the Governor, Deputy Inspector-General of Police and other officers and persons in respect of the arrest, custody and detention of Mark Anthony Lyster Bracegirdle.2. No action, prosecution or legal proceeding whatsoever shall be brought, instituted or maintained against Reginald Edward Stubbs, Governor and C.commander-in-Chief in and over the Island of Ceylon and the Territories and Dependencies thereof, or against the Deputy Inspector-General of Police (Criminal Investigation Department) of the said Island of Ceylon, or against any. police or other officer of the Government of Ceylon, or against any person whatsoever acting under the direction of the said Governor or the said Deputy Inspector-General of Police or any such police or other officer in respect of any act or act done by the said Governor or the said Deputy Inspector-General of Police or by any such officer or person as aforesaid for the purpose of securing to or effecting arrest, custody or detention of the said Mark Anthony Lyster Bracegirdle, or in connection therewith; and the said Reginald Edward Stubbs, the said Deputy Inspector-General of Police and every such officer or person as aforesaid are hereby freed, acquitted, discharged and indemnified as well against the Crown as against all and every person whatsoever, from all legal proceedings of any kind whatever, whether civil or criminal, in respect of any such act or acts as aforesaid.Saving.3. His Majesty hereby reserves, and himself, his heirs, and successors, power, with the advice of his or their Privy Council, to revoke, alter, or amend this Order as to him or them shall seem fit.  Ends.
(11)Telegram from the Governor of Ceylon to. the. Secretary of State.Dated 26th May, 1937. (Received 2-57 p.m. 26th May, 1937.)No. 107.   Secret.Supreme Court&apos;, constituted by Chief Justice and two Puisne Judges, referred, to Maxivell, Fourth Edition, page 122, lines 17 to 19, and Government of British Empire, by Keith, chapter 7, first paragraph, and held that all provisions of Order in Council, 1896, and circumstances under which it was proclaimed in Ceylon in 1914, should be examined in order to see whether Article 111, Clause 3, intended to confer absolute power on Governor as contended by Attorney-General, that Court could look at preamble amending Order of 1916 which specified reasons for Order of 1896 to determine scope of latter Order, and that powers under Article 111, Clause 3, could only be used in times of emergency, nature of emergency being state of war or grave civil disturbances. Court said that, as affidavit filed by Secretary to Governor only alleged that Governor made Order complained of, as circumstances had arisen rendering it necessary in the public interest to make them, averment in petitioners&apos; affidavit that no such emergency as was contem-plated by Order in Council had arisen, was uncontradicted, and that Orders were therefore ultra vires. Legal Secretary agrees with Supreme Court, and strongly of opinion that Judicial Committee, mindful as always of liberty of subjects, will refuse to grant leave to appeal. Despatch with full judgment of Supreme Court follows by air mail of 29th.
