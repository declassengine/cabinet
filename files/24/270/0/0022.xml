(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT.)COPY NO. .    AtyC A B I N S T. NATIONAL REGISTRATION.Note &quot;by the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence.At their 295th Meeting held on 1st July the Committee of Imperial Defence had under consideration a Note by Lord Swinton,  Chairman of the Man Power Sub-Committee, covering a report hy the Registrar-General1s Sub-Committee (C.I.D. Paper No,  1328-B).2. The Registrar-General&apos;s Committee was appointed in December 1936 hy the Man Power Committee with thefollowing terms of reference:-&quot;To evolve a scheme for the compilation of a National Register and for its maintenance in peace at such a pitch that it would he available for national service purposes within 24 hours of the outbreak of war&quot;.3. The Sub-Committee reported in March 1937 and submitted a scheme.      Their report was considered hy the Man Power Committee on 5th May, when it was generally agreed that National Registration in peace was at present politically impracticable.      On that occasion the Chairman of the Man Power Committee in summing up the discussion thought that the Committee of Imperial Defence would have to be offered the following alternative courses.First possible course:-    to adopt the new scheme suggested in the Registrar-Gener al&apos; s report (C;I.D.  Paper No.  1328-B).      The disadvantages   of this course were that it would be interpreted in some   quarters as a prelude to the introduction of conscription.3JLCJLE T-CP.  177(37).
Second possible course:-   to postpone registration until war seemed to &quot;be imminent,  in the hope of completing the preliminaries before war actually broke out.      This alternative would involve the difficulty that the very taking of the preliminary steps might appear to be almost tantamount to mobilization.Third -possible course:-    to abandon all idea of completing a Register in peace,4,      The Man Power Committee agreed:-&quot;that the alternatives set out by the Chairman should be put to the Committee of Imperial Defence and that authority should be sought for the taking of such preliminary steps in peace,  e.g. Ear-marking of enumerators ana the printing of forms ana of documents,  as would secure the completion of a register within a iaonth of the outbreak of war&quot;,5.      When on 1st July the Committee of Imperial Defence considered the Note by the Chairman of the Man Power Committee and the Registrar-General&apos; s report,  the general opinion was that the institution in peace time of a scheme of national registration was politically impracticable. On the other hand there was general agreement that the preliminary steps suggested by the Man
r* /Tj f%Power Committee should he taken in peace time,as they would facilitate the compilation of a register with the maximum of speed in anemergency.     These preliminaries would involvethe enrolling of some 50,000 local officersand this would be hound to attract public attention and provide propagandists with capital for making trouble.      It was felt therefore, thatit would he impossible to take even these measures without first consulting the other political parties.     The advantages of ascheme of national registration were recognised in connection with the identification of casualtiesresulting from air raids, as registration wouldenable identity hooks and/or discs to he issued in peace time.     Registration would also heindispensable for purposes of food-rationing.If, therefore, there was any prospect of passing the necessary legislation for the completescheme the Committee of Imperial Defence would favour this course.6.      In addition,  the Committee of Imperial Defence were impressed hy the fact that the principal military Powers of the Continent are able (owing to conscription) to allocate in peace time personnel to war posts in industry, to the great advantage of their arrangements for industrial mobilisation.     Our preparations for industrial mobilisation have not yet reached the stage when we can even calculate the man-power required for the purpose.     But when that stage
is reached,  it is difficult to see how we can organise our nan-power in a manner in any way comparable with the arrangements of Continental nations without the sort of information that registration in time of peace would provide.      We should therefore enter a war in a comparatively disadvantageous position in this important respect.7. To sum up? the points I wish to submit tothe Cabinet are as follows:-(a) Whether a scheme of National registration in peace time is desirable and prac-ticable from a political point of view.(b) Whether,  as an alternative to (a),  theChairman of the Man Power Committee should be authorised to make preparations in peace time by the printing of forms and the enrolment and instruction of regis-tration officers,  notwithstanding that these measures would involve some measure of publicity.(c) Whether the Opposition Parties inParliament should be consulted either on (a) or (b).(Initialled)      T.W.H.
