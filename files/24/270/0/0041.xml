THE &quot;HASTINGS&quot; SCHEME. Note by ,the President of the Board of Trade.The Cabinet Committee on the Organisation of the Coal Mining Industry decided at their meeting on the 20th July,  1937, that there should be referred to the Cabinet the question of the attitude to be adopted by the Government towards a scheme which has recently been put forward by Lord Hastings.      I attach a paper on the subject by the Secretary for Mines, with which I am in entire agreement.A copy of Lord Hastings&apos;  draft scheme is annexed to the Secretary for Mines&apos;  paper, but I  should explain that this is at present in draft form.      I understand that it is to be considered at a -meeting of the mineral owners on Tuesday next, the 27th July.      If modifications are then made in it,  I hope to oe able to inform the Cabinet of them on Wednesday, the 28th July.O.F.G.S..Board of Trade,23rd July,  1937.
UNIFICATION OF GOAL ROYALTIES, THE &quot;HASTINGS&quot; SCHEME.Memorandum &quot;by the Secretary for Mines.It will be unnecessary to remind the Cabinet of the undertakings which have been given on behalf of the Government, both before and since the last general election, to introduce a measure to effect the unification of Coal Royalties.    It will also be within the recollection of the Cabinet that some eighteen months ago negotiations were initiated between the Government and the Mineral Owners&apos; Joint Committee on the nature of the scheme to be adopted.The Executive Committee of the Mineral Owners1 Joint Committee in February,  1936, submitted to me a memorandum entitled &quot;State Acquisition of Coal Royalties&quot; in which they said inter alia,    &quot;In our view the private ownership of Coal Royaltiesis, on balance, an advantage to the Coal Industry ..............Although we are on principle opnosed to the nationalisation of Coal Royalties, it is not our wish to be obstructive.    On the contrary, assuming that the Government is not to be dissuaded from its declared policy in this matter, it is our desire to render such help as our special knowledge and experience enable us to give.    It is in this spirit that we submit the following scheme for the purchase of Coal Royalties by the Crown:-&quot; They then went on to suggest the nature and extent of &quot;the property and rights to be acquired&quot; and in doing so, suggested that the &quot;transfer&quot; of whatever was to be transferred &quot;should be effective quickly&quot;, and that the transition period &quot;should be as short as possible.&quot;Next they dealt with &quot;the process of valuation&quot;, and suggested a scheme whereby &quot;the total compensation&quot; would be fixed by the Act at a figure representing the total value of &quot;coal royalties treated as a whole&quot; and the subsequent valuation-1-
of each separate property would &quot;he made only for the purpose of apportioning a pre-determined amount&quot;.Next they set out their idea of what the total, or global, figure   should be,   and then dealt with various matters of &quot;machinery&quot; and other things.My object in quoting from this Memorandum of the Royalty Owners is to show beyond question that in February, 1936,  the Royalty Owners fully understood that the Government&apos;s &quot;declared policy in this matter&quot; was as stated by the  (then Attorney-General in the Debate oh the Address on 9th December,  1935, viz.,  that unification meant &quot;the purchase of the royalties by the State&quot; and &quot;public ownership and control by the State in the interests of the community&quot;.It was with the same understanding that during the summer of last year negotiations took place between the Financial Secretary to the Treasury and a Committee of the Royalty Owners concerning the amount of the &quot;global figure&quot; - a &quot;global figure&quot; basis having been suggested by the latter in the Memorandum of February, 1936.      The Royalty&apos;Owners first asked.  150 million,  subsequently reduced to  112^-million. The Government considered both these figures too high and an agreement was later made between the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Royalty Owners that the figure should be determined by arbitration by the &quot;Greene&quot; Tribunal,  that the Government should then have the option either to drop their proposals altogether or to introduce a Bill to acquire the property on the basis of the Tribunal&apos;s decision, and that in the latter event the Royalty Owners would accept the Tribunal&apos;s figure.&apos;     The relevant extract from the Treasury letter (accepted by the Royalty Owners) is attached.      (The substance was reproduced in the &apos; Government statements in both Houses on 9th March).The Tribunal awarded a figure of  66.45 million and the Government announced (on 26th April) their acceptance of it ana
their intention to introduce a Bill accordingly.Sufficient progress had been made with the preparation of this Bill to enable me some months ago to send certain of the draft clauses to the Royalty Owners&apos; Committee and to the Joint Consultative Committee of Colliery Owners and Miners for their observations.These clauses contained the proposal that the property and rights to be acquired should vest on an &quot;appointed day&quot;, that the valuation of each acquired property should be as on that day, that the compensation payments (which might be some four years after the &quot;appointed day&quot;) should carry interest at 4%. from the &quot;appointed day&quot;, ana that meanwhile the present owners should receive the rents and royalties accruing from their respective properties as payments on account of compensation and interest.The Royalty Owners raised violent objection to being required to part with the ownership of their properties in advance of payment for it.      They recognise that the ascertainment of the compensation due to each owner must take some years., and their contention is that, subject to a measure of control during this period, the ownership should not pass to the statutory owner until after the compensation due to each has been ascertained ana paid.     The Royalty Owners also criticise the scheme of valuation proposed by the draft clauses.      Indeed, they contend.that it is unworkable (and I am conscious that it is not free from difficulty).      They have intimated that they could themselves suggest an alternative plan of valuation which would be acceptable to them and, with their co-operation, would be practicable and could be completed in four years.    I know generally the nature of it and I think that it might have features of value;    but they have declined to submit it to me officially except on the footing that the Government are prepared to meet them on the question of the vesting date.There are objections, both financial and political, to meeting them on this question, but the Cabinet Coal Committee
have now approved a proposal that I should intimate that the Government are prepared in principle to consider meeting them, and that, in consultation with the Treasury and the Chief Valuer, I should explore the possibility of an agreed compromise.    As a first step I saw their Parliamentary Committee yesterday and informed them that, while giving no undertaking as to how far the appointed day might be moved forward,  the Government would not insist on the suggestion of its heing about six months after the passage of the Bill, if ail the difficulties which we and they foresaw about valuation and the aegree of control of the property to be assumed at once could )?e satisfactorily aealt wi-th by the experts from both sid.es,    The- deputation indicated that, so far as they were concje^ned, discussions between the experts might proceed.      It r^sts, Of course, with the larger body of Royalty Owners to authorise this and I cannot say whether they will do so.The position, however, has recently been further complicated by Lord Hastings&apos; suggestion   that the whole meaning of unification as hitherto conceived an$ embodied in the draft clauses should be revised,      The Royalty Owners&apos; Committee have seized upon statements made by myself at a deputation and by Lord Halifax in the House of Lords on 203?d June, to the effect that the Government would, of course, he willing to consider any su^estion that Lord Hastings might submit, ^nd recently informed me that in view of these statements.they had, for the present, abandoned consideration of the government draft clauses and were concentrating entirely UPQn the &quot;Hastings&quot; alternative plan.      It is of urgent importance therefore, that they should be informed definitely and at/ once whether or not the Government are prepared to consider it.
This plan, of which a copy is attached, is one by which all coal and associated rights would, by Statute, be vested in four district companies with capitals totalling the  66^ million of the &quot;Greene&quot; Award, each present owner receiving shares in the appropriate company according to the proportionate value of his coal property, but the management or direction of each company being in the hands of Government appointees. Thus no actual money would be required to buy out the present owners;    they would merely &quot;sell&quot; their properties to the district company in exchange for shares therein, and, subject to a &quot;deferred&quot; allocation for the benefit of the coal mining industry, would continue to receive the royalty revenues in the form of dividend on their shares.They justify this kind of plan on the ground that the avowed policy of the Government is &quot;unification&quot; under public control, that for this purpose expropriation is not essential and that their plan does achieve &quot;unification&quot; under public control, for, whilst it is primarily by districts, they   propose also some form of central co-ordination.      They claim, too, that it has advantages over the Government plan in that it avoids the need of raising the  66-g- million in cash, and that, by providing for district units, it preserves the interests of the present owners in the working of coal and thereby avoids the conflict of interest between coal-working and surface ov/nership, which is an inherent objection to expropriation of coal.It will be apparent, however, that this plan would not fulfil the Government policy of unification under public ownership, and that it is indeed a direct departure from theRoyalty Owners&apos; undertaking to accept the &quot;Greene&quot; Award as the price payable for the acquisition of their coal properties.   -\
Under this plan they do not, in effect, part with anything at all, beyond the limited &quot;deferred&quot; interest which is allocated to the industry.      Subject to this qualification they merely amalgamate their interests in district companies belonging to themselves.     They offer Government control by providing that, subject to some conditions,  the directors of each Company shall be nominated by the Government.      But in return they ask that the Government shall guarantee the interest on the  66^ million to the extent of 4% per annum, and, incidentally,  shall pay all the valuation and other costs of carrying out the scheme.It will be apparent that the  .66.i million proposed for the capitalisation of the amalgamating companies has no real identity with the :; Greene&quot; Award.      The undeniable understanding has been that the present owners should part with their property in exchange for such sum of compensation or purchase price as the Greene Tribunal might award, viz.  66-g- million.     Under their scheme they part with nothing, in a financial sense -even ostensibly - beyond the value of the annual allocation to the industry, which,  at  450,000 per annum, may be of the value of something of the order of  6,000,000.     I say &quot;even ostensibly&quot; because I think-it is true to say that, looking at the scheme as a-whole,, not even that concession is made at their expense.     For in asking for the Government to guarantee 4/i on the capital of  66-1- million, they are in fact asking for something, under that head alone, having a market value of quite  82 million;    and when the value of the deferred interest (calculated to yield a further  1.3 million) per annum is added, the total value to them of their scheme is approximately the  100 million which they hoped to get, but did not get, from the Greene Tribunal.
I am convinced that the prospect of relief of royalties is politically an essential feature of any scheme.    The colliery owners are already less than lukewarm and the miners&apos;  support will he measurable largely hy the prospect of royalties-relief and its ultimate effect upon wages.The Government scheme visualises the prospect that,  as the purchase-loan is progressively redeemed,  royalties-relief may progressively increase, until, after redemption is complete, royalties may fall to a more or less nominal level.The Royalty Owners&apos;  scheme,  it is true, offers an annual &quot;bonus&quot; to the industry amounting,  in present conditions,  to about 10$-12$ of the total royalty-receipts or about  450,000; but the other side of that coin is that as-to the remaining 90$ of royalty payments there is no prospect or possibility of any relief.Even if the political background did not make this scheme impossible, it would still be financially unacceptable on its own merits.      For even if there were any features, in it to justify any Government guarantee, why should the Government guarantee a rate of 4$ when they could themselves borrow on the market at a lower rate of interest?    It will be observed too that there is no provision for any form of redemption or other measure to put a term to the Government&apos;s liability.    The alleged advantage of the scheme in relieving the Government of the need of raising a loan for purchase is, on those terms, wholly illusory.    And what the allocation for the industry would be, if reasonable provision for &quot;redemption&quot; were included,  is a matter  for conjecture.Nor, incidentally, can I see that the existence of district companies, particularly of the size here proposed,  could have any possible effect upon the future relationships between coal-working and surface interests which is one of the points at issue with the colliery owners.    No single owner of surface would have a large enough interest in the royalties company to affect his dealings with his surface.

Both on politicial ana financial grounds, therefore, Lord Hastings&apos;   scheme is,  I suggest, quite unacceptable,  and I think that if the Government adopted it they would lay themselves open to.the justifiable criticism of having surrendered completely to an attempt by the royalty ov/ners to upset the Greene Award.    I suggest,  therefore,  that I should be given authority to. inform them, in a letter,  the terms of which might be agreed between my Department and the Treasury, that the Government, having considered the scheme, cannot accept it.    It is to be hoped that discussions would, as indicated on page 4 of this paper, proceed on the basis of the Government&apos;s scheme in the hope of finding a workable compromise on the vesting date question.H.C.23rd July, 1937.Mines Department.

With regard to the objects to be served by theTribunal&apos;s decisions  it is to be understood that the Mineral Owners&apos; Joint Committee will accept the decision as representing the compensation properly payable to the owners for the property in the event of the Government proceeding with their present proposals for its acquisition.      But  the Government shall have the right at any time within six weeks after the delivery of the decision of the Tribunal to give notice to the Mineral Owners&apos; Joint Committee that they are not prepared to accept the decision of the Tribunal,  in which event the Government will not proceed with their proposals for the purchase of the property except at some global figure determined by agreement between the Government and the Committee. If notice is not so given,  the Committee shall be entitled to assume that the Tribunal&apos;s decision is acceptable to the Government and that the Government will introduce during the present Session of Parliament a Bill to acquire the property on the basis of the Tribunal&apos;s decision.
STRICTLY PRIVATE. 15th July, 1937.HEADS of a SUGGESTED SCHEME for the UNIFICATION and CONTROL Of COAL ROYALTIES.The Scheme to he elaborated and embodied in a Bill as aGovernment measure.1. Five coal owning Corporations to he established to acquireand control the Royalty Owners&apos; interests in the different coal fields of Great Britain (excluding the Forest of Dean).2.- They might be grouped geographically and named:A. The Scottish Coalfields Corporation,,B. The Northern Coalfields Corporation (to the north of theCity of York) comprising the following:No r thumber1and Durham andCumberlandC. The Midlands Coalfields Corporation (to the north of theCity of Worcester) comprising:Lancashire and Cheshire YorkshireDerbyshire, South Derbyshire Nottinghamshire, Leicestershire, Shropshire North Staffordshire, South Staffordshire and Worcestershire, Cannock Chase and Warwickshire and North WalesD. The South Wales Coalfields CorporationE. The Lesser Coalfields Corporation comprising Bristol,Somerset, Kent,30 The present owners of coal in such areas to be allottedstock in proportion to the value of their individual interests.4. The capital of each Corporation in respect of its ownership ofcoal to be as set out in the Schedule.5. The individual valuations (and therefore the holdings in eachCompany) to be determined by Panels of Assessors in each coalfield on such lines as those indicated in the memorandum (since amended)
prepared &quot;by the Mineral Owners&apos; Joint Committee and scaled up or down as may he necessary to make them accord with the sums indicated in the Schedule as the capital of each Corporationo6. Each Corporation to he controlled and managed hy a Board ofnot less than 5 nor more than 7 Directors appointed by the Board of Trade of whom at least 2 shall he approved hy the Mineral Owners&apos; Joint Committee and he familiar with the area controlled by the Corporation,,70 The remuneration of the Directors of each Corporation shall he such as the Board of Trade shall approve,8. The net income of each Corporation (before deduction of IncomeTax) shall he applied as follows :-(a) In the payment to the stockholders of a minimum preferentialdividend guaranteed in whole or in part hy the State which obtains control.(b) In the allocation of 25% of the balance of such net income for the benefit of the coal mining industry.(c) In the establishment of a Reserve Fund (for not less than 50years) at the rate of 5% of the Corporations net income.(d) In the payment of an additional dividend on its capital.90 If the net income of a Corporation is in any year insufficient to meet the minimum preferential dividend on its capital, the deficit shall be met by borrowing from the Reserve Fund.

The above figures will be subject to Income Tax.In this illustration the Forest of Dean is included. Royalty Owners believe that the average net income of  4,430,000 will increase and that the balance available annually will consequently be larger.10. There should be co-ordination between the Corporations inall matters relating to the coalfields, but the income of one Corporation should not be adversely affected by the action or circumstances of any other Corporation,,11. As between the Corporations and the Surface Owners the corporations should accept the obligations and liabilities as to damage - subject to existing leases - indicated in the memorandum furnished by the Mineral Owners&apos; Joint Committee to the Mines Department.12. The Corporations to be formed and the valuations completedas soon as possible with the co-operation of the present owners and their advisors and in such order as the Board of Trade may decide.13. It is contemplated that the costs involved will    in thecircumstances be borne by the State.
