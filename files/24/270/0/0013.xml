(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNICilAJBSTY1 3 GOVERNMENT ) .COPY NO.SECRETCP.  168/37.. CABINET india appreciation of the Political Situation, by the Government of India, dated 23rd June, 1937.Circulated for the information of the Cabinet by the Secretary of State for India.
Confidential appreciation of the Political situation in India, dated the 23rd June, 1937, issued on the authority of the Secretary of State for India.The operations in Waziristan continue.    On 18th May the troops advanced to Ghariom, a group of villages in Sham Algad, distant only a few miles from the Faqir of Ipi&apos;s headquarters at Arsal Kot.    Considerable opposition was met with during this advance, and our   casualties were 3 Indian other ranks killed and 17 Indian other ranks wounded.    The enemy are believed to have suffered much more heavily. The advance of the troops was necessarily slow as with each bound forward a road had to be made to enable supplies to reach them and road-making takes time in this difficult country.The next advance took place on May 27th, when a converging movement was initiated on Arsal Kot from Ghariom and Mirali.    Arsal Kot was reached on May 28th but the faqir of Ipi had fled before the troops arrived. - There was considerable opposition on May 27th but practically none on May 28th.    Our casualties on May 27th were 6 British other ranks and one Indian other ranks killed and 7 British other ranks and 17 Indian other ranks wounded.    After destroying the caves used by the faqir of Ipi, the troops withdrew again to Ghariom.    On June 4th an advance was made to   Madamir Kalai, at the junction of the Sham and Shaktu Algads and since then a brigade has marched over Barari Narai to Sararogha on the Razmak Jandola Road.As a result of the operations culminating in the advance to Arsal Kot, the main body of hostile tribesmen has dispersed.    Most of the Afghan tribesmen have returned to their homes.    There are still a number of small bodies
of hostile tribesmen seeking opportunities for mischief, but there is no longer any organised resistance.    The exact whereabouts of the Faqir of Ipi since he left Arsal Kot are doubtful, but he is believed to be somewhere in extremely difficult country along the Mahsud Bhittanis border.    The Tori Khel Wazirs, against whom the operations were originally directed, are sueing for peace, and the terms to be granted them are under consideration.    Mean-while hostile action against them as a tribe has been suspended.    The Mahsuds have provided the backbone of the opposition during the last few weeks, though no section Of the tribe has openly declared itself hostile. 3. Raiding in the Bannu and Dera Ismail Khandistricts has continued, the hostile tribesmen finding it a more profitable and less dangerous pastime than attacks on troops.    The Bhitannis have played a large part in these raids, the worst of which was at Umar Tittar Khel in the Bannu district when 4 Hindu girls were carried off.    One of these has since been released and 3 are still with the Bhitannis.    Punitive air action has been taken against certain Bhitannis villages.4. Detailed reports received since the lastappreciation was written, amply confirm the first impression that the coronation was celebrated with enthusiasm and success in every province.    Except in a few places, Congress, while advocating non-participation in the ceremonies, refrained from active demonstration; and the occasion gave evidence of the ease and amity with which the various communities unite when professional agitation is relegated to the background by great events.
5. The administration of the Provinces is being carriedon uneventfully by the ministries.    In the 6 Provinces in which Congress are in a majority the Legislatures have still not been summoned; and it is clear that, in the time thus . given to the electors and their representatives for reflection, the futility of the official Congress attitude towards the acceptance of office has caused growing impatience.    The experience of the existing ministries shows that acceptance of office brings real power and responsibility! the programmes published by them naturally cover a good part of the Congress election promises and the feeling is growing that it is unreasonable to refuse such opportunities merely to satisfy a punctilio.    That Gandhi is not insensitive to this feeling is shown by some recent pronouncements.    However, the President of-Congress had only recently returned to India from a tour of Burma and Malaya, and it remains to be seen what decision will be made by the Working Committee of Congress when it meets shortly to frame its orders to the provincial organisations.6. Precluded by their own decision from the constructivetask of government, Congress activities in these six provinces have been largely confined to gestures against the Ministers,. such as assembling members of the legislature and passing votes of no confidence against the ministries.    In one province the meeting proved a conspicuous failure, Congress failing to secure a majority of the elected members for the motions.    In the villages widespread propaganda continues, designed to justify the policy adopted and to prepare the way for another election..   By setting up unofficial enquiry committees, by preaching revolt against landlords and by advocating non-payment of rent, the Congress have where
2 91)opportunity offered sought to exploit local grievances to their own advantage.    Of particular importance are the strenuous efforts made to draw the Moslem community into the Congress fold.The situation on the frontier has, however, proved a serious source of embarrassment.    Bitter controversy was aroused by the action of Congress in prescribing the holding of public meetings on &quot;frontier day&quot;, May 28th, to condemn the policy of Government on the North West Frontier.    In their efforts to win over the Moslems, Congress succeeded in arousing deep resentment among large sections of the Hindu communities, who regard the policy pursued on the frontier as the minimum safeguard for their fellow Hindus against the ravages of Moslem tribesmen.    On the Moslem side, moreover, at a meeting of the Moslem League at Lucknow, of which mention was made in the April appreciation, allegiance to the Congress was unequivocally repudiated and for the moment Congress attempts to win Moslem support have failed.7. It is difficult to believe that the unrest causedby these manoeuvring^ is not in some degree responsible for the continuing communal clashes.    Although tension in Sind, Bihar,  and in the Punjab, of which   mention was made in previous reports has diminished, disorders have occurred in nearly every other province.    In Madras city a trivial incident led to prolonged rioting between Hindus and Moslems from 27th April to 5th May, in which one person was killed and 43 persons injured.    In a recrudescence of the disturbances 2 Hindus were stabbed to death.    At Tinnevelly, in the same province, Moslems looted and burned 64 Hindu houses.    In Poona a dangerous situation arose, while in
Bombay city, 10 persons were killed and many injured in severe communal rioting.In the United Provinces one Moslem was killed and 2 injured by Hindus in Shahjahanpur.    In Lucknow a bitter controversy has been raging between the Shia and Sunni sects of Moslems;    while a committee appointed by the Government were preparing their report rioting broke out between the sects which continued sporadically for a week, 7 persons being killed and many injured.    In Bengal, Central Provinces, Assam and in the Worth-West Frontier Province minor Incidents have occurred.8. These communal incidents and the attitude of congress in 6 provinces, where they might be in office if they wished, need not obscure the fact that both in those provinces and in the remaining 5, where majority ministries are in power, the machinery of Government runs smoothly.    It is worthy of note that the industrial situation in Bengal has greatly improved by the termination of the widespread strikes in the jute mills. A settlement was reached through the personal intervention of the Chief Minister and the month closed with the mills generally working at full strength.
