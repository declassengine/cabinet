2, Vfoitehall Gardens,S.W.I.21st July, 1937.My dear Prime Minister,I enclose with this the result of my consideration of-what is generally called the Fle.et Air Arm Question.     You will remember the conversations which took place in consequence of the then prime Minister&apos;s original decision that this question should he reconsidered by a Committee of three, Halifax, Oliver Stanley and myself.     As the result of those conversations I stated in answer to a Parliamentary Question on the 11th March that with the aid of the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee and the other responsible authorities concerned I was to conduct a systematic investigation of the important factors involved in this matter including the allied wider considerations.      I was asked on the same occasion by the Leader of the Opposition when I was likely to come to a conclusion on this important matter, and I replied &quot;as soon as possible&quot;.      Everyone, I think, expected not merely an academic discussion but a decision.You will find on referring to my Report that I have expressed a definite opinion that the Fleet Air Arm should be transferred to the Admiralty.    This may possibly be considered to be going outside the duties which I announced I was about to undertake.     It may be suggested that I was to investigate the strategic questions involved and not the facts.     I have done my best to consider the strategic position, but as pointed out in my Report, so far as the Fleet Air Arm is concerned, there is no question as to its operational control, nor as to its permanent allocation to and indeed identification with the Fleet.     Having stated that fact I might have said no more concerning the Fleet Air Arm.     This,- i -.
however, seemed to me rather futile.     I therefore took into consideration the admitted facts and came to the conclusion that the Admiralty should have not only the operational hut the administrative control.When I came to the shore based aircraft, I was dealing with air units which the Admiralty, contrary to the views of the Air Ministry, asked should be permanently allocated to the Admiralty.     This difference of opinion, involving the question of operational-control, raised the broad strategical question of the best use of our available air forces.      I have discussed this question in my Report and I have come to the conclusion therein stated that the Admiralty demand should not be granted.In forming my opinion on the Fleet Air Arm, I am conscious that as much as ever, perhaps more than ever, close co-operation between the two Services is required. I am thinking not only of the task of transferring the Fleet Air Arm, but of the work which the Admiralty and the Air Force have to carry out, of preparing a proper system of trade defence.     There must be a well thought out control of operations.     We have a centralised system of control of the territorial defences of the country, but a great deal more is needed.     I propose to undertake with the chiefs of Staff the task of carrying to completion the schemes which have been adumbrated in Reports by the Chiefs of Staff and the Joint Planning Committee on Trade Defence.      I believe a decision in accordance with my suggestion concerning the Fleet Air Arm will facilitate the necessary planning, always assuming that there is no more disagreement between  the- S
Services on the questions I have attempted to decide. For this reason I hope whatever you or the Cabinet decide will he accepted as both final and satisfactory.Yours ever,(Sgdo)    T.W.H. INSKIPThe Right Hon.Neville Chamberlain, M,pc- 3
SECEET.THE NAVY AND ITS RELATION TO THE FLEET AIR ARM ANDSHORE-BASED AIRCRAFT.Memorandum by the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence.I NOW make my report as the result of the examination which I was requested by Mr. Baldwin, then Prime Minister, to make of the factors involved in the question of the Fleet Air Arm and shore-based aircraft required for work in co-operation with the Navy.2. The use of aircraft in connection with naval operations, and in particular the organisation of the Fleet Air Arm, have been the subject not only of a prolonged controversy, but of repeated enquiries. Some account of these enquiries is given later in this Report. The expression &quot; the Fleet Air Arm &quot; is generally understood, and as used in this Report covers the aircraft which are borne by ships of the Royal Navy. The greater part of it is borne in carriers; the other part consists of aircraft in capital ships and cruisers which are fitted with catapults to give the machines an initial start. Beside the Fleet Air Arm, shore-based aircraft and seaplanes and flying boats operating from harbour bases are employed on a number of tasks over the sea in co-operation with or in aid of naval forces. These last-mentioned aircraft will be referred to in the Report as shore-based, as distinguished from the ship-borne aircraft, of the Fleet Air Arm.3. The Fleet Air Arm is part of the Royal Air Force. The Air Ministry provide the aircraft and equipment (except torpedoes) in accordance with the needs of the Admiralty, who specify the numbers and types they require. The Admiralty provide the ships together with their equipment, including all special apparatus required for the aircraft. The crew of each machine consists of a pilot and observer or air-gunner, or both. The observers and air-gunners are drawn from the Navy and do not hold Air Force rank. The pilots, on the other hand, all hold Air Force rank, either as Air Force officers or sergeants, or as Naval officers who have been given a temporary Air Force commission in addition to their Naval rank on being attached or seconded to the Air Service. The carriers have a staff of Air Force officers and a maintenance personnel of Air Force tradesmen. Otherwise the personnel in the carriers is Naval. The personnel of the Fleet Air Arm comes under Naval discipline afloat and under Air Force discipline ashore.4. The Air Ministry are solely responsible for providing all shore-based aircraft. They settle the numbers and types. Likewise, the personnel in connection with shore-based aircraft are drawn from the Air Force. In fact, these aircraft and their personnel are an ordinary part of the Air Force, though, as circumstances require, a certain number of them may be employed on such duties over the sea or in coastal areas as reconnaissance, anti-submarine work, or attacks on enemy sea-borne forces.5.   An enquiry into the relations of the Navy and the Air Force as regards the control of Fleet air work was held in 1923 by Lord Balfour, Lord Peel, and Lord Weir, who were members of a Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence appointed to consider questions of National and Imperial Defence. [15656] B
Their proposals, as modified or interpreted by an Agreement of July 1924 known as the Trenchard-Keyes Agreement, have been the basis of the organisation of the Fleet Air Arm down to the present time. From time to time, however, dissatisfaction with the system has been expressed by the Admiralty, and attempts have been made to reopen the broad question decided by the Balfour Committee with a view to transferring the administrative responsibility for raising and maintaining the Fleet Air Arm, as well as the operational control, to the Admiralty. Soon after my appointment as Minister for Co-ordination of Defence, Lord Monsell, who was then&quot; First Lord, addressed a letter to me, dated the 21st April, 1936, in which, after saying that he felt anxiety as to the efficiency of the Fleet Air Arm, he asked me to conduct an investigation into the working of the system. The then Prime Minister did not approve this course, but directed a limited enquiry concerning three matters specially mentioned by Lord Monsell as requiring attention, namely, the provision of personnel, the period of service for pilots, and reserves. I reported on these matters on the 3rd November, 1936.6. The Air Ministry were prepared, though reluctantly, to accept my recommendations and, so far as they were concerned, to give effect to them. The recommendations, however, did not satisfy the Admiralty, and, in fact, no changes have been made in the system as the result of my Report. Subsequently, as the result of representations made to the Prime Minister by Sir Samuel Hoare, who had succeeded Lord Monsell as First Lord, the Prime Minister directed me to make an investigation with the aid of the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee and the other responsible authorities concerned of the factors involved in the matter of the Fleet Air Arm. Memoranda were accordingly prepared for me by the Admiralty and the Air Ministry. I have examined and discussed these with the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee and have considered to the best of my ability the strategic questions raised in the course of these discussions.7. The two Services directly concerned are in sharp disagreement as to the principles on which a sound policy should be based with regard to the use of air-craft by or for the purposes of the Navy. The controversy has sometimes seemed to have died down and the two Departments to have found a solution of their problems in the day-to-day administration of the Fleet Air Arm. Between them they have undoubtedly produced a force of remarkable keenness and efficiency. Nevertheless, the disagreement has persisted and to-day the Admiralty and the Air Ministry still have to be described in the words of the Balfour Report as &quot; the contending parties.&quot; In order to understand the Balfour Report it is necessary to trace briefly the development of the Air Force.8. The year 1911 was the starting point. In that year the use of the air was first officially recognised as having importance for military purposes, by the creation of the Air Battalion of the Royal Engineers. In the same year two aeroplanes were lent by the Royal Aero Club to the Navy for the instruction of naval officers in flying. In the following year a Sub-Committee of Imperial Defence, under the Chairmanship of Lord Haldane recommended the formation of a Flying Corps which should consist of a naval and a military wing and the establishment of an Air Committee composed of representativesvof the Admiralty and the War Office. There was also to be a Central Flying School for the training of pilots. My attention has been specially directed to the opening words of the Sub-Committee&apos;s recommendations, &quot; The British Aeronautical Service should be regarded as one.&quot; In 1914, however, the Naval wing was officially renamed and recognised as &quot; The Royal Naval Air Service,&quot; and so continued until in March, 1918, it was formally transferred to the Air Ministry. This had come into existence as the result of the Air Force Act, 1917. Meanwhile, what had been the Military wing had become the Royal Flying Corps. This also was merged in 1918 in the new Air Force under the Air Ministry. It is not necessary to narrate the various steps which were taken with regard to the administration of the Air Forces in the years of the war. The various changes could not prevent the swift develop-ment of Air Power for purposes far more extensive than that of mere reconnaissance which was at the first its main use. The Navy in particular found a variety of employments for the units at its disposal, such as service with the Fleet, patrol, convoy, offensive operations, spotting and even in giving help on the Western Front. It was mainly the realisation of the importance of this new weapon and of the tasks that could be undertaken by it that led to the demand for
one Air Force and an Air Ministry. It is impossible not to recognise that this step was right. The development of the Air Force would probably have been far less satisfactory if there had been during the period of growth two parallel and more or less equal Air Forces each under a different Department. Under this system the Air Units used by the Navy came under the Air Ministry, thus becoming an integral part of the Royal Air Force, though they were under the operational and disciplinary control of the Admiralty at sea.9. Very soon after the war, the Admiralty and the War Office each made a move to secure control of what they regarded as belonging properly to their respective forces. The Navy wished to reconstitute a Royal Naval Air Service over which it would have undivided qpntrol. The War Office went rather further. They wanted the Air Force to be divided up between the Admiralty and the War Office, with the consequent disappearance of the Air Ministry. The Air Ministry objected to both demands, and neither Department succeeded. An announcement was made in Parliament in March 1922, in favour of the continuance of the Royal Air Force. The decision did not lead to an abatement of the Admiralty&apos;s claim. They continued to press for the return to them of the Naval Air Units maintained by the Air Ministry.10. In these circumstances the Balfour Committee were appointed and made their Report. They set out the two views advanced by the Admiralty and by the Air Ministry respectively. The objection of the Air Ministry to the Admiralty&apos;s demand was that the removal of the Fleet Air Arm from their jurisdiction &quot;would in the opinion of the Department lead to many administrative difficulties and much overlapping, while in the region of supply and research it would hamper progress and increase expense &quot; (paragraph 3 of the Balfour Report). The Admiralty case was summarised in paragraph 4 of the Report: &quot; In their view a Fleet Air Arm is now as necessary to a fleet as cruisers, destroyers or submarines. Aerial reconnaissance and aerial &apos; spotting 1 are as &quot;strictly naval operations as gunnery, torpedo work and wireless telegraphy. It seems to them intolerable that, while they are responsible for the safety and success of our Battle Fleets, the air work on which that safety and that success in large measure depend should be performed by persons belonging to another Service, imbued by different traditions, and looking for support and promotion to a different Department.&quot;The Committee expressed their sympathy with both points of view and while they did not think the present system could remain altogether unchanged, they did not think it &quot; possible to sever completely the Air organisation which does work for the Fleet from the Air organisation which is responsible for Home defence against air attack and for co-operating with the Army in other theatres of operation.&quot; They recommended &quot; a course somewhere between these two extremes,&quot; and in so doing they made a number of recommendations all of which were approved and adopted. -11. Many of the Recommendations, though important at the time, require no notice in this Report. The seventh Recommendation directly touched a point which was much discussed in the course of my investigations : &quot; The Admiralty are apprehensive lest, in time of war or other emergency, the Air Ministry might withdraw from the Navy units of the Fleet Air Arm and use them for other purposes. In respect of this we recommend that it should be definitely laid down that the personnel, materiel and reserves of the Fleet Air Arm should not be withdrawn by the Air Ministry without either the consent of the Admiralty or a decision of the Cabinet.&quot;The Committee then passed to the questions which they regarded as the most difficult and the most important. These questions may be grouped under one head &quot;co-operation.&quot; The Committee were clearly impressed with the importance of giving a certain number of officers in each Service a practical knowledge of the &quot; needs and capacities of the other Service.&quot; The obvious method of securing this object was to provide for an exchange of officers. The question was how could this be arranged, having regard to the natural reluctance[15656] b 2
of a sailor to change his naval for a non-naval environment. It is possible in this part of their Report to see how the mind of the Committee worked in arriving at their recommendations under this head of co-operation. They regarded and described the duties of a pilot serving in the Fleet Air Arm as &quot; naval duties,&quot; and they laid down that no naval officer seconded to the Air Force for service in the Fleet Air Arm should be asked to perform non-naval air duties. He was to change his naval for a flying uniform with a badge to distinguish him from &quot; flying men under the Air Force. &quot;* The Committee treated him as &quot;to all intents and purposes still under the Admiralty &quot;; he was merely adding &apos;&apos; accomplishments in naval flying to the other accomplishments which his brother officers are cultivating.&quot; As an illustration of what these new accomplishments were, fleet reconnaissance as well as naval spotting was allocated by the Committee to naval officers seconded or otherwise. Looking at the position of a Naval Officer in this light, the Committee pointed out that to describe his appointment to serve in the Fleet Air Arm as &quot; secondment &quot; to the Air Force was to use the word in a sense not generally intended (paragraph 37).12. This discussion was followed by a Recommendation that &quot; the number of officers seconded from the Navy to the Air Force&quot; was to be left to the Admiralty to determine &quot; subject to the proviso that not less than 30 per cent, of Air Force officers, whether regular or short service, should serve on board the carriers.&quot; I cannot help thinking that the interpretation which has been placed on this Recommendation by the Admiralty has altered the emphasis intended by the Committee. In the Admiralty memorandum prepared for my investigation, the Committee&apos;s Recommendation was stated as follows : &quot; The proportion of Naval Officers borne in the Fleet Air Arm should be increased at Admiralty discretion up to 70 per cent.&quot;The difference in words is slight, but the effect has been, as I understand, that the 30 per cent, reserved for Air Force officers has been treated as a fixed propor-tion and not a minimum. It may be doubtful whether the difficulty, which has recently increased, of getting enough naval officers to volunteer for Fleet Air Arm service would have been altogether met by increasing the proportion of Air Force Officers, but, however that may be, the policy adopted by the Admiralty, in exercise of the discretion given to them by the Balfour Report, of making the Fleet Air Arm predominantly naval in its pilot personnel, cuts across the theory that the Fleet Air Arm is concerned with the air and therefore belongs to the Air Ministry.13. The same clash between the theory just mentioned and practice arose in connection with personnel other than pilots. By the Trenchard-Keyes Agree-ment of 1924 it was arranged that in a number of cases naval ratings should be substituted for Airmen in units of the Fleet Air Arm afloat, but were to be considered as forming part of the flight or other unit of the Fleet Air Arm with which they were employed. Further, it was agreed that in the case of certain trades, naval personnel and not Royal Air Force personnel of the Fleet Air Arm embarked in His Majesty&apos;s ships should carry out such work as might be required. The &quot;other rank&quot; controversy illustrates the difficulty of deciding what really is a nicely balanced question, namely, is the Admiralty or the Air Ministry the Fleet Air Arm&apos;s proper home, or, to put it a little differently, is the Fleet Air Arm a Naval or an Aeronautical organism.14. The appointment of the Colwyn Economy Committee in the following year, 1925, provided an opportunity for reconsidering the claim of the Admiralty to administer their own air units, which at that time meant everything ship-borne. The Colwyn Committee took a more clear-cut view than the Balfour Committee. They favoured no middle course, and affirmed definitely &quot; the necessity for an independent Air Ministry, to administer a single unified Air Service which should carry out all air work, whether for the Navy, Army or Central Air Force.&quot; In view, however, of existing arrangements, they did not recommend the abolition of the Naval officer personnel, but only the limitation of their number to 30 per cent.* Note.-The main Committee in a covering memorandum wrote:  &quot; With regard to uniform, the officers and men generally of the Fleet Air Arm will wear a distinguishing badge on their uniform. If the Admiralty desire, the Naval officers attached to the Fleet Air Arm will retain their Naval uniform with the same badge.&quot;
instead of 70 per cent, of the officer personnel of the Fleet Air Arm. The Colwyn Committee were no doubt thinking chiefly in terms of economy, but economy is not to be forgotten even when efficiency is the chief consideration, and this opinion deserves attention. No changes were made as the result of the Colwyn Report: nor were there any as the result of a reference to Mr. Baldwin as Prime Minister in 1926 of still-existing differences between the Admiralty and the Air Ministry, covering more or less the same ground.15. In this last mentioned reference to Mr. Baldwin the Admiralty&apos;s case included a claim for the control not only of ship-borne aircraft, but of a number of shore-based units in addition, and consequently also for some part in the control of shore establishments of the Royal Air Force. I am informed that the terminology used by the two Departments in respect of the shore-based aircraft at this time was different, reflecting their different points of view : the Admiralty called them -&apos;&apos; Admiralty Naval Co-operation Units &apos;&apos; and the Air Ministry &quot; Coastal Reconnaissance Flights.&quot; Mr. Baldwin ruled against the Admiralty on all points. It will be necessary for me to deal later on with the shore-based aircraft, to which the Admiralty attach great importance.16. One further claim by the Admiralty must be mentioned before I pass to a discussion of the principles upon which the two Departments respectively base their present contentions. In 1928 the Admiralty wanted naval ratings to be trained and employed as pilots. There is no doubt this proposal was consequent upon the shortage of Naval officers. It was referred to Lord Salisbury and he rejected it. The proposal was renewed in 1934, and it was one of the matters referred to me by Mr. Baldwin&apos;s direction in 1936. I recommended that twelve to fifteen naval ratings should be trained by way of experiment, with a view to the permanent incorporation of naval rating pilots in the Fleet Air Arm. The Secretary of State for Air offered to make the experiment. My report on this point as on others was stillborn; the Admiralty thought my suggestion came too late, and in any case was too small to merit a trial. The efficiency and, indeed, the existence of the Fleet Air Arm were said to be in jeopardy, and the Admiralty raised the whole question of its control.The conflict between the two Services on this question of naval rating pilots is an example of the causes which have kept alive the present controversy. The only way of making the system with its cross allegiances and complex organisa-tion work is by maintaining complete accord and co-operation, both as to the objects to be attained and the methods to be used. The Air Ministry in 1932, by agreement, had secured the right to train a limited number of Royal Air Force sergeants as pilots for the Fleet Air Arm. No corresponding agreement could be reached concerning using naval ratings. The Admiralty, who are in the words of the Balfour Report (paragraph 4) &quot; responsible for the safety and success of our Battle Fleets,&quot; and who provide the officers and Other personnel required by the Aircraft carriers, were not adjudged able to settle a matter of this sort for themselves. The Air Ministry&apos;s case was largely based on the contention that the petty officer in the Navy is not so suitable for flying training as the sergeant in the Air Force. Whichever view was right, it is plain that the friction resulting from such differences was not likely to promote smooth working.17. I now pass to consider the case presented by the Admiralty and the arguments on principle by which it is supported. It divides what are called by the Admiralty &quot; Naval air units &quot; into two classes : (i) those employed on a mobile basis; (ii) those employed in specific areas. The first class consists of the ship-borne aircraft, or, in other words, the Fleet Air Arm. They come under the general operational control of the seagoing fleet, but, as already stated, they are provided and maintained by the Air Ministry, and, organically and administra-tively, are part of the Royal Air Force. The second class takes in all units, whether flying boats or seaplanes or ordinary aircraft, which are employed in tactical co-operation with the Navy upon such duties as trade defence, coastal or sea reconnaissance, anti-submarine work and other local patrols, and attacks on enemy seaborne forces. The Admiralty take as a text or title for their general argument the phrase &quot; naval air work.&quot; As used by the Admiralty, it connotes the assistance which the Navy must have in the air in order to enable it to carry-out the task of Imperial Defence in all its aspects. The: Air Ministry do not recognise any distinction between naval air work and other air work; to the Air[15656] b 3
Ministry it is all air work, and flying over the sea is in its essential features no different from flying over the land. The Admiralty dispute this in limine; they say that a number of naval functions are now performed in suitable circumstances by an improved method, that is to say, by aircraft instead of by seagoing ships. The functions, however, remain naval, and to carry them out efficiently it is necessary to specialise in the training of the personnel and in the design of the aircraft. The use of aircraft with the Fleet, they say, is a natural and indispensable part of a complex naval operation. The Naval Commander therefore, it is said, must have the operational control of aircraft working in this close tactical co-operation, and operational control carries with it responsibility for organising, manning, training and equipping the air units concerned. It is to be observed that there is no difference of opinion between the Departments as to operational control.18. The above argument as set forth in the Admiralty memoranda is repre-sented, at any rate sometimes, as applicable to the whole of the air units, both ship-borne and shore-based, which are considered by the Admiralty to be engaged on naval air work. Close examination of the Admiralty Memoranda seems to show that it is intended to apply only to the ship-borne aircraft. But however this may be, I have to make up my mind as to whether the argument is sound first with regard to the Fleet Air Arm and, secondly, with regard to the shore-based aircraft. Before stating my conclusions on these two questions, I must summarise the Air Ministry answer to the Admiralty. Their thesis is that it is impossible to define the several roles of the Services so as to draw a hard line between what belongs to one Service and to another. A modern war carried on in three elements requires a full measure of co-operation and flexibility in the use of all the armed forces. No one Service can be made independent and self-contained. The system under which the Army and the Air Force co-operate with each other is taken as an illustration. There is a permanent allocation of &quot;a few specially trained and equipped squadrons &apos;&apos; for employment with the Field Force, provided and manned by the Air Force but under the complete operational control of a Military Commander. For the rest, the Army relies on the temporary allocation, as and when required and in accordance with the heeds of the situation as a whole, of Air Force fighter and bomber squadrons. The Air Ministry argument is enforced by reference to the fact that our resources in finance, material and personnel are limited, while at the same time demands on the total air striking power of the country are very heavy. Specialisation is not conducive to economy in the use of bur&apos;resources.19. I find this line of argument very convincing, though its application to any particular proposal remains always to be considered. There is no room for doubt as to the interdependence of the three Services. Illustrations could be multiplied. Whether the interdependence extends only to the strategic sphere or to tactical operations also, seems to me largely a question of words and their meaning. Any major operation is almost certain to involve the support of one Service by another, and the day-to-day duties of each Service are complementary to the duties of the others. The proper answer to a demand for naval forces to assist the army both strategically and tactically is not to create in the War Office a Naval department. Similarly, on general principles, the. right solution of the problem of the use of air power in aid of the Navy is not to make the Navy self-contained in point of its air requirements, but to call on the Air Force to meet them.20. These, however, are general principles, and they do not necessarily provide the right solution of a particular problem.. As far as possible, if I am right in accepting them, they should be observed, but the facts cannot be forced into the framework of a system which they dp not fit merely because the system is in theory the idealone. Botn the Admiralty and the Air Ministry have attempted to crystallise the controversy between them in the form of a single question.  The Air Ministry propose thefollowing question :- &quot; Can the fighting resources of this country be utilised better under asystem of self-sufficiency of the Services or under that of the maximum of flexibility in co-operation between them V&apos;The Admiralty define the issue as a contest &quot; between specialisation which implies the close identification of the naval air units with the Royal Navy on the
one hand, and on the other hand the unification of all the country&apos;s air forces.&quot; I find neither of these statements wholly satisfactory. The &quot;maximum of flexibility &quot; may be very undesirable if pressed too far. &quot; Self-sufficiency,&quot; on the other hand, is not the Admiralty&apos;s goal. It is plainly unattainable in practice and, moreover, in my opinion, wrong in theory. The Admiralty &apos;s definition of the critical question, on the other hand, errs in assuming that &quot; specialisation &quot; is obnoxious to the Air Ministry. I agree with the Admiralty as to the importance of specialisation. No &quot; all-purpose &quot; machine or training could possibly be satisfactory. &quot;Specialisation,&quot; however, is not inconsistent with the &quot;unification of all the country&apos;s air forces&quot; under the Air Ministry. The question, as it presents itself to me, is whether or not unification ought to be rigidly maintained and, if not, how far the exceptions should go. In answering this question it is necessary to consider separately, first, the Fleet Air Arm and, secondly, the shore-based aircraft.21. First, as to the Fleet Air Arm, the employment of these aircraft is the responsibility of the Admiralty. It is not in dispute that they are assigned permanently to the Admiralty, subject to Cabinet decision to the contrary. It makes no difference to their strategic use whether administratively they come under the Admiralty or the Air Ministry, provided they are to be treated operationally as a fixed part of the Naval Forces. The Admiralty say that they are responsible for the security of the Empire against sea-borne attack. That proposition as a broad statement descriptive of the Admiralty&apos;s position seems to me true, though it is subject to the important rider that the Admiralty cannot discharge the responsibility without the aid of the Air Force working in close co-operation. The question, however, goes further than that. The Fleet Air Arm, as the phrase suggests, not only co-operates with the Fleet; it is an integral part of the Fleet. If it was possible to draw a line between the ship and its personnel and the aircraft and its personnel and to treat the latter as part of an external entity finding accommodation in the ship but not being in any way concerned with the life of the ship, I should take the view that the aircraft in question should be administered by the Air Ministry. But the air unit in a carrier or in a capital ship is a great deal more than a passenger in a convenient vehicle. It forms part of the organisation of the ship, and as such is a factor in the efficiency of the ship, its whole raison aVetre being the employment of air power in naval operations. The Naval Officers primarily concerned with the working of the ship are not only responsible in some degree for the success of the work of the aircraft, but they have to accept a large measure of responsibility for the safety of the crews of the aircraft. I find it impossible to resist the inference that when so much that concerns the air units depends upon the Naval element in the ship and in the Fleet, the Admiralty should be responsible for selecting and training the personnel, and generally for the organisation of the Fleet Air Arm. Again the work of the Fleet Air Arm with its inevitable naval environment and having regard to the high degree of specialisation in equipment is in my opinion more likely to be efficient if the Admiralty are now made responsible. This if accepted will mean that a pilot in the Fleet Air Arm will no longer be an Air Force Officer. I am informed that there is a serious shortage of pilots. As already pointed out, it is possible this could have been avoided by diminishing the proportion of naval officers in the ranks of the pilots. But even if the accepted proportion of Naval pilots were reduced so as to produce all the pilots required, I should not regard the system as satisfactory to-day. I do not for a moment throw doubt upon the wisdom of the decision taken by the Balfour Committee and repeatedly affirmed. The proportion of the Fleet Air Arm to the Air Force was considerably smaller at the time of that Enquiry and there was reason to believe that the separation of the Fleet Air Arm in those circumstances would be likely to cause duplication and waste. Undoubtedly another consideration of great importance was the desirability of fostering a spirit of co-operation between the two Services, instead of merely considering the problem from the point of view of the interest of a single fighting Service. These and other considerations led both the Balfour Committee and the Government to decide adversely to the contentions of the Admiralty in 1923, but the recommendations were not at the time and in my opinion ought not now to be regarded as a final judgment. To-day co-operation between the Services is axiomatic and is exhibited in practice so
much that it is safe to assume it will not be jeopardised by the transfer of the Fleet Air Arm. Reconsideration of the whole question and of the arguments involved has led me to the conclusion already stated.22. I have not considered the detailed measures which will be necessary on the footing of my recommendation. The organisation of a wholly Naval Fleet Air Arm is bound to take a long time, and it is likely that it will be necessary to do the work in stages. Responsibility for supply and design is not a primary demand on the part of the Admiralty. They recognise the advantages of a unified organisation of supply, at any rate up to the stage of delivery of the manufactured material. The working out of the details of the supply organisation can only be done by the two Departments concerned; that there are possible objections cannot be disputed, but I have no doubt at all that such an organisation can be made to work satisfactorily and that the two Departments will take care that nothing is wanting in a determination to make it work. The Admiralty ask to have closer contact and a more decisive voice in settling the type of machine suitable for use in the Fleet Air Arm.  I think this is reasonable.23. Similarly plans for the provision and training of personnel now to be undertaken by the Admiralty must be devised by the Admiralty in consultation with the Air Ministry. The experience of the Air Ministry will be indispensable to the Admiralty in the formation of these plans. In so far as the Admiralty are not able to provide personnel in sufficient numbers, new methods will have to be considered. So far as numbers are concerned, these will be restricted by the capacity of the carriers and capital ships. I assume that the number of carriers will be regulated by Cabinet decisions.24. I now pass, secondly, to the shore-based aircraft. The Admiralty claim is for the specific allocation of &quot; a certain irreducible minimum of shore-based aircraft &quot; for the duties mentioned in paragraph 17. No number is specified in the Admiralty memorandum, and any allocation, whether in peace or war, would necessarily be subject to revision. It is not contemplated that such an allocation would be a maximum of the Navy&apos;s demands upon the Air Force. The terms in which the Admiralty&apos;s &quot; specific claims &quot; under this head are stated, namely, for &quot;a certain irreducible minimum of short-based aircraft specifically allocated,&apos;&apos; show that the Navy is likely to have requirements additional to this suggested allocation. The circumstances of the moment will dictate these requirements. In other words, the Air Force will be expected to provide aircraft to carry out the duties of sea reconnaissance, convoy, anti-submarine operations and similar duties in co-operation with naval forces, whenever the aircraft specifically allocated are considered inadequate,25. The Admiralty further contemplate that the specific allocation for which they ask shall be made effective by transferring to them, as in the case of the Fleet Air Arm, both operational control and &apos;&apos; responsibility for equipment, organisation, manning, training and operations in peace.&quot; The basis of this claim is the statement that operational control in war over units required at all times to operate in close tactical co-operation with ships on purely naval duties is valueless without the above-mentioned responsibility. I have considered this claim in the light of the very careful and elaborate examination by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee of the problem of protection of sea-borne trade in the event of war with Germany. The place of aircraft in the defence measures necessary is dealt with by the Sub-Committee in their Report (C.O.S. 552, the 2nd February, 1937). Aircraft must play an important part in trade defence. The numbers required must, in any case, be large, even after allowing for the reconnaissance facilities of the sea-going forces, including ship-borne aircraft. The limitations, mentioned in an earlier part of this report, of our total resources make it impossible to keep continuous observation over the whole of the North Sea. Other illustrations could be given of the gap between an ideal system of trade defence, so far as aircraft are concerned, and what is practicable. To lock up aircraft in order to keep every area simultaneously under continuous observation is unjustifiable. The only alternative is to distribute the available air forces so as to provide the necessary services at the right time. This entails the closest co-operation between the two Commands. It will not be easy, and to expect that the Navy will always have 100 per cent, of the aircraft it would like
assigned for trade defence is an excess of optimism. But I see no other way of meeting the case. The strain upon the national resources imposed by the plans for the Air Defence of Great Britain is tremendous. The proper balance between the air forces used in trade defence and those used in the defence of Great Britain as well as those required for co-operation with land forces can only be preserved by a continual process of adjustment in consultation between the three Services.26. It is obvious that special training in and equipment for work with Naval forces over the sea are indispensable. A measure of specialisation is essential. I see no reason why the necessary training with proper equipment should not be given in the Air Force, though here again the best results can only be attained by a good understanding and a close liaison between the Admiralty and the Air Ministry.27. I have come to the conclusion that the Admiralty&apos;s claim with regard to shore-based aircraft ought not to be admitted.28. The matters submitted to me for my consideration are, as so often is found to be the case in an acute controversy, questions of degree and proportion rather than questions that can be answered in absolute terms. Partisans outside the Services often speak as if there was a simple yes or no to the demand of the Navy and of the Air Force. That is not possible in my judgment. I regard the Air Ministry as the central authority responsible for developing air power. They must conduct experiment and research. The science and the art of flying must grow under the fostering care of the Air Ministry. Moreover, subject always to Cabinet control, the Air Ministry must be responsible for building up and controlling our air resources including the industrial capacity. If my view as to the Fleet Air Arm is approved difficult problems are likely to arise in giving effect to it. Goodwill and a determination to make the plan succeed are essential; if these conditions exist success is certain.29. I submit the foregoing for consideration. If it is approved the next step will be for the Admiralty to work out and propose plans for giving effect to the decision to transfer the Fleet Air Arm and for the Air Ministry to consider the scheme and settle such details as require adjustment.(Signed) T.
