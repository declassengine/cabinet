I pnCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.COPY NO. ^188(57)CABINET.REPORT OF JES IMPORT DUTIES ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON THE IRON AND STEEL INDUSTRY.Memorandum &quot;by the President of the Board of Trade.My predecessor in July 1936 invited the Import Duties Advisory Committee &quot;to examine the present position of the iron and steel industry in the light of all the data now available and, in so far as is practicable, to report with due regard to the national interest on the general lines of its future development&quot;.    The report of the Committee was presented and published (Cmd. 5507) a few days ago.This reference to the Import Duties Advisory Committee was made in response to expressions of doubt in the House of Commons as to the conduct of the policy of the industry in the new conditions created by the tariff and the agreement with the Continental Cartel, and in particular as to the action or inaction of the Federation in regard to the proposal for a steel works at Jarrow.    The arrangements which have since been made for the establishment at Jarrow of a steel works on a smaller * scale than that originally proposed have served to ease public opinion on that subject, and the detailed account which the Committee give of the cause of the breakdown of the original proposals can also be expected to have a good effect.-1-
Most of the recommendations in the report are directed mainly to the industry itself, though some will require consideration hy Government Departments.      At present, however, I wish to bring to the attention of my colleagues one recommendation of major importance.The Committee throughout the report refer to the changes which the last few years have brought in the conduct and development of the industry, and in paragraph 46 say that they start their consideration of the problem on two broad propositions:-&quot;The first is that there cannot be a return to the unorganised conduct and almost casual development and the largely unrestricted competition at home andfrom abroad which characterised the industry until *i1932;    and the second is that the State cannot divest itself of all responsibility as to the conduct of an industry so far-reaching in its scope, so vital to the national well-being, so largely dependent on State fiscal policy for its prosperity, and now being brought into a closely knit organisation&quot;. The Committee immediately after stating these propositions refer to the desirability of the policy of the Iron and Steel Federation and its Associations being &quot;subject to some over-sight by a body wholly independent of the industry&quot;.     The Committee refer to this subject on many occasions in the report, notably in regard to the regulation of development (paras.57 to 67), the control of prices (para.87) and the power of Associations to coerce independent manufacturers (para. 98), In concluding their report the Committee say (para.144) that &quot;great progress has been made in the movement from the purely individualist standpoint to the conception of an ordered and co-operative industry acting with a full sense of its responsibilities to the community and to the realisation of that
conception in practice,&quot; and add (para,145) that not the least important of the developments, that have taken place has &quot;been the acceptance by the industry and by public opinion &quot;of a general oversight of the policy of the industry by an independent body looking to the public interests in it-s widest sense&quot;.     They refer also to the fact that, in view of their responsibility in relation to tariff measures, a statutory obligation rests on them to investigate any complaints that measures of protection afforded on their recommendation are being used improperly.In&apos; paragraphs 145 and 146 the Committee say that &quot;it is for His Majesty&apos;s Government to   decide to what extent the oversight now being exercised of the iron and steel industry should continue and be recognised, and, if so, by whom it should in future be exercised&quot;.     And in paragraph 146 they add that &quot;it may be that in course of time experience will show that something further is required; and possibly that the objects in view can be attained only if the Federation itself and the independent body acting for the State are provided with statutory powers&quot;.In my view,  the necessity for the oversight to which the Committee refer as having been exercised in the last few years has largely arisen from the very unusual conditions in the iron and steel industry in that period.     The tariff measures of the Government combined with the agreement with the Continental Cartel involved a complete change of conditions in an industry which had been seriously depressed for many years, and would thus in any event have necessitated a careful watch on the development of the industry.     The emergence of an unforeseen and unprecedented demand for iron and steel, both here and abroad, has increased the strain on the industry and has added to the anxiety of the public
regarding the capacity of the industry to cope with its problems.     At the moment, therefore^ it seems to me that the oversight of the affairs of the industry by some outside body is desirable if not essential.But I. still hope that in course of time it will be possible for the relations between the iron and steel industry, the Government and the public to return to a more normal condition, and that eventually the Government will not have to take any greater responsibility for the conduct of the affairs of this industry than for the conduct of other industries.      I should certainly hesitate to recommend the continuance for all. time of direct supervision of (and therefore responsibility for) such matters as the control of price and the development of production;    still more should I doubt the wisdom of endowing the Federation and an independent body with statutory powers of enforcing their decisions on such subjects.Some doubt has been expressed in the Press and elsewhere as to the desirability of continuing to entrust this task to the Import Duties Advisory Committee.      The formation of a new body for this purpose would however entail serious disadvantages.     The Import Duties Advisory Committee are responsible by statute for recommending any changes in import duties that may be necessary (and many have been necessary in recent months), and for this purpose they must take into account all relevant considerations, including the development of the home industry under the stimulus of the tariffs already imposed, the prices charged by the industry and the interests of consumers generally.     Any new body would necessarily be preoccupied with the same subjects but there is no certainty that they would tender the same advice to the Government on them as is tendered by the Import Duties Advisory Committee.
fj i OMore over s we could not set up a new bocTy without giving it terms of reference.     We can ask the Import Duties Advisory Committee to continue for the time &quot;being the oversight they have already exercised;   we should have to give any new Committee a more precise reference and we might be pressed to give it powers.      On all counts .1 think this undesirable, and I propose therefore, if my colleagues agree to invite the Import Duties Advisory Committee to continue for the time being the oversight of the affairs of the industry which they sa.y in their report (para. 145)  &quot;has devolved almost inevitably on them in view of their responsibility in relation to tariff matters&quot;. If I am pressed in regard to the Government&apos;s view as to whether this oversight should continue,  I should propose to say that the Government think it essential that it should for the present and that they will give further consideration to the matter when the exceptional circumstances of the present time pass, ana. the future position of the industry is more clearer established.O.F.G.S.Board of Trade,16th July, 1937.\
