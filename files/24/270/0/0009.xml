SEATING- ARRANGEMENTS FOR MEMBERSOF THE CABINET.The acconroanying letter, with enclosures  which I have received from the Earl Marshal in reply to the letter sent to him in accordance with Cabinet 24 (37), Conclusion 9,  is circulated by direction of the Prime Minister, who proposes that it should be taken note of by the Cabinet at their next meeting.(Signed) M.P.A.

Copy of letter from the Earl Marshal to the Secretaryto the Cabinet,ARUNBEL CASTLE.Jane 20th 1937.Dear Sir Maurice,Thank you for your letter0      I enclose some notes which I think will help to explain matters.      They raise the same points as you did in your letter.      I will naturally make a note of the wishes of the Cabinet,,      I am sorry that anyone should have been upset by the seating in the Abbey, the more so as Major Howard and I took a great deal of trouble to see that the Cabinet had good seats.I feel I should point out also that the best seats are those occupied by the Peers and Peeresses and we did place the Cabinet as near to them as possible I can easily keep a block on any similar occasion for the Cabinet should they so wish it0     perhaps you will let me know if I can send any farther information for the Prime Minister0Yours sincerely,(Signed)    NORFOLK0
Copy of Note &quot;by Mr. A.H.S. Howard, C.V.O., Norroy King of ArrasoCollege of Arms,Queen Victoria Street, London, E.Cc4,Netes on the Seating in the Abbey.The Choir Stalls in 1911 took all Cabinet and ex-Cabinet Ministers and their wives.Owing to the requirements of the Dominions, Colonies and Foreign Office there was only room down to Sir John Simon with the addition of Mr. and Mrs. Lloyd George (Ex-Prime Minister), Mr. Bennett, ex-Prime Minister of Canada and Mr.  and Mrs. Attlee.Members of Parliament claim a right to sit in the north and south Transepts and this was also claimed by the Dominions and Colonial MoP*s.  etc.It was decided that British MoP&apos;s should draw lots for seats, but I made an exception with Cabinet Ministers, Privy Councillors and Under Secretaries. These latter three categories were given front rows and the MoP&apos;s sat behind by ballot.The ground floor was fully occupied by Peers and Peeresses.      The first tier was also occupied by Peers and Peeresses for a distance of six rows and nine rows respectively.      The second tiers were entirely M*P&apos;s and distinguished Colonials.I put Sir Samuel Hoare and other Cabinet Ministers who should have been in the Choir Stalls, in the front row  of the 2nd tier, in preference to the sixth row of the 1st tier, because they were far &quot;better seats to see from.      They were as good as you could want.It was not possible to follow the precedent of 1911 owing to the large number of Colonials and Indians, e
and owing to the fact that two additional tiers were built this year, which did not exist in 1911.Privy Council Judges were by consent seated with other Judges.Privy Council Peers were of course seated in strict order of precedence with other Peers.5
