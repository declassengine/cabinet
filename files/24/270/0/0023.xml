Printed ydpitJiei Cabinet:; July 1937&apos;.SECRET. Copy No. 3CP. 178 (37).CABINET.THE UNION OF SOUTH AFRICA AND THE KING.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.IN September last I circulated to my colleagues a note on a point that had arisen in the Union of South Africa regarding the lists of toasts at a Union Government banquet to the Transport Conference, held at Johannesburg (CP. 247 (36)).It will be recalled that the toast list then adopted by the Union Government included &quot;His Majesty, King of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland &quot; in a list of foreign Heads of States, while at a later stage, after these toasts, there appeared separately the toast of &apos;&apos; His Majesty King Edward VIII, Sovereign of the Union of South Africa.&quot;Subsequently, General Hertzog issued to his Government Departments a note on &quot; procedure and forms re toasts to Heads of States to be followed in future at banquets.&quot; This note generally confirmed the practice described above; a copy of it is appended.My colleagues may remember that as the representations which were made at the time through our High Commissioner were unsuccessful, and as it did not appear likely that any further occasion would arise in the near future for the adoption of the new form of toast list, I thought it desirable to take no further action in the matter until General Hertzog was available in this country for personal discussion.During the Imperial Conference I had an opportunity of discussing the matter with General Hertzog and Mr. Havenga, and as a result the toast list at similar Union Government banquets in future will contain only one toast of His. Majesty. This will, I understand, be honoured in one or other of the following forms : &quot; The King, Sovereign of the Union,&quot; &quot; The King, our Sovereign,&quot; or &quot; Our King.&quot;   Subsequently, the Heads of Foreign States will be toasted.I think this is a satisfactory conclusion to the incident.M. M.July 7, 1937.Procedure and Forms re Toasts to Heads of States to be followed in Future at Banquets.1. Every Commonwealth State is entitled to have the King toasted separately in relation to itself, in such a manner and in such terms as it may deem appropriate.[15545]
2. In toasting the King separately in relation to the Union, the most appropriate form of toast is &apos;&apos; The King, Sovereign of the Union! &apos;&apos; &apos;&apos; The King, our Sovereign! &apos;&apos; or&quot;Our Sovereign! &quot;according to the occasion.3. The Toast List adopted at the Transport Conference banquet at Johannesburg on the 7th September last was correct and appropriate, and, subject to paragraph 1 above, the form accepted on that occasion will, mutatis mutandis, be observed in future at all official dinners when foreign and Commonwealth guests are entertained.
