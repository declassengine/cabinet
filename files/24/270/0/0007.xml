COPY NO. -CAB I N E T.RATIFICATION Off LONDON NAVAL TR5ATY, 1.936.Joint- Memorandum by the Secret any ate for Foreign . Affairs. and&quot; t&apos;p.e First.&quot; Lord     .june Admiralty;.At its meeting cf the 18th March.  1936,  the Cabinet decided &quot;to authorise the signature of a three Power Naval Treaty on the understanding that, it would not be ratified unless,  or until,  a corresponding bilateral treaty was concluded with GermanyMc      On the 16th December,  1936,  the Cabinet further reviewed the position and decided that the following action should be taken.(a) that the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the First Lord of the Admiralty should be given discretion to decide in consultation when the appropriate moment had arrived for ratification!(b) that ail arrangements should be made here and in the Dominions to oermit of ratification at short notice;(c) that the French Government should be invited to conform their procedure to curs so that if negotiations proceed satisfactorily the Treaty may come into force as from January 1st. ;Up to the present no stops have been taken to effect ratification of the London Naval Treaty of 1936,  as in the first place His Majesty&apos;s Government were anxious to give the Japanese Government up to April 1st last, being the time limit fixed by treaty, to reply on the question of the 14&quot; gun,  and secondly His Majesty1s Government wish to have an opportunity of making further progress in their negotiations
with. Germany and Soviet russia      The 14&quot; gun issue has, as a result of the Japanese refusal of March last, been decided, and it is only therefore the question of the conclusion of agreements with Germany and Soviet Russia that has been holding up ratificationThe present state of our negotiations is now well advanced0     Full agreement has been reached with Germany and His Majesty&apos;s Government are now awaiting the views of the Soviet Government on the last-standing point, namely the text of Article 6 of the draft Anglo-Soviet Agreement on the subject of sub-category (a) cruiserso     It is hi-ped that the Soviet reply which should be forthcoming before the end of the month will be favourable0      In this case His Majesty&apos;s Government can proceed without delay to the conclusion of the two bilateral agreements0The French Government are now pressing His Majesty&apos;s Government very hard to ratify before the end of this month      The French Government have only obtained provisional authority for ratification from their Parliament and will thus be obliged, in case of further elelay, to go back to the Chamber and furnish explanations which might be embarrassing and end in French refusal to ratify.      It is also understood from the French Embassy that, apart from Parliamentary difficulties, it may be difficult to continue the exchange of information on naval construction &quot;beyond the date fixed in the protocol of signature, namely, July 1st, 1957, unless the Treaty is ratified this months     The French Embassy are fully prepared to ratify in agreement with His Majesty&apos;s Government this month, whatever bo the state of the bilateral negotiations.
It is considered that there is every advantage in ratifying the London Naval Treaty, 1936, this month, whether the bilateral negotiations with Germany and Soviet Russia have been finally concluded or note Ratification will ensure the preservation of the qualitative limitations contained in the London Naval Treaty at least as between Francs, UoSaAo and His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom and the Dominions concerned and will give a lead.to the other principal Naval Powers in the matter of naval limitation.      In the went of Germany or Soviet Russia not concluding bilateral agreements, and eventually failing to conform with Treaty limitations, or if any Power such as Japan exceeds the Treaty limitations,the position of His Majesty&apos;s Govei^nment in the United Kingdom is fully saf e-*guarded. by recourse when required to the relevant escalator clause of the Treaty,,      In these circumstances, it is proposed to take the necessary steps to ratify the London Naval Treaty, 1956, before the end of this monthaIt is to be considered whether Parliament should, be given an opportunity of expressing their views on the Treaty before ratification takes-place.     This can be most easily done on the Second Reading of the London NaTral Treaty (1956) Bill.(In-bid o)     AoE.19th June, 1937o
