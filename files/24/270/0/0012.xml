Memorandum by the President of the Board. of E due at ion ancLthe Secretary of State for&apos;Scotland.For some time enquiries have been receivedfrom Local Education Authorities asking whether theBoard propose to issue any advice on this subject, andin June 1956 the Association of Education Committeespassed a resolution in the following terrass-&quot;That in view of the national importance of the question of air raid precautions in respect of school children and of the necessity for complete co-ordination of arrangements between the Board of Education and the various public authorities concerned; as well as the necessity for the assurance of parents, and the avoidance of panic, the Executive Committee of the -  Association of Education Committees be requested to initiate joint consultation and collaboration between representatives of the Board of Education, the Home Office, the public authorities and others concerned with a view to advising local education autho riti es thereon&quot;.The matter was discussed by officers of ourDepartments and of the Air Raid Precautions Departmentof the Home Office, and it was decided to prepare aMemorandum for consideration by representatives ofLocal Authorities and of other interested bodies.    Asthe result a draft Circular has been prepared whichembodies the views of officers of our Departments and ofthe Air Raid Precautions Department, and of representativeof Local Education Authorities and teachers, both inEngland and Y/ales and in Scotland.\
Before this Circular is issued, we have thought it right to inform our colleagues, as it is &quot;bound to have considerable publicity.     However there appears to be no alternative, as we clearly cannot refuse to give the guidance which has been asked for &quot;by responsible authorities.      It would &quot;be possible to give this advioe by means of a confidential document instead of &quot;by the normal method of a Circular^ but the existence of any corifidential body of advice would inevitably &quot;become known, and the fact that it had been given confidentially would give rise to surmises of an alarmist character.      Our colleagues will see that the tone of the draft Circular is far from alarmist,, and that it expressly deprecates anything in the nature of *fee raid drill in schools, a practice which would certainly excite hostile comment.      Subject to their observations, we should propose to issue the Circular in the near future, with such verbal changes in the copy sent to local authorities in Scotland as may be necessary in view of Scottish conditions.This memo ran dum has been examined &quot;by the Treasury ana tne accompanying Circular by the Treasury, and the Air Raid Precautions Department of the Home Office.S.

Draft Circular, to Local Authorities on Air...Raid...Precautions,in SchoolSolo      Measures for safeguarding the civil population against the effect of air attack have &quot;become a necessary part of the defensive organisation of any country which is open to such.attacks      The need for them is not related to any &quot;belief that war is imminent.      It arises from the fact that the risk of attack from the air, however remote it may be, is one that cannot he ignored, and because preparations to minimise the consequences of attack from the air cannot be improvised on the spur of the moment, but must be made, if they are to be effective, in time of peace.2.      The problem of the protection of school children in time of air attack has been under consideration by the Home Office Air Raid Precautions Department and the Board of Education.      The responsibility for determining the arrange-ments which are best suited to the circumstances of particular localities or schools is primarily one for the Local Education and School Authorities in consultation with the local Air Raid Precautions authorities, and the measures to be adopted in particular areas will need to be co-ordinated with the general scheme of protection - for the locality as a whole. The following notes have accordingly been prepared with a view to setting out for the assistance of those concerned certain considerations which it is recommended should be borne in mind when the problem is under review.3.     While the importance of carrying on the work of the schools as far as possible during a national crisis, both on educational and social grounds and in order to minimise the unsettling effect on the public mind of the dislocation
of normal services, will not be disputed, the primary consideration must &quot;be the  safety of the children.      Each Authority will therefore wish to consider whether in the conditions likely to prevail in its area at such a time it will he reasonable to expect parents to allow their children to continue to attend school.      If it should be decided that the schools should remain open, then the Authority must consider what preparations should he made beforehand to meet the possibility of an emergency arisingo4.      The schemes being prepared by local authorities with the advice of the Home office are designed to afford protection to the public against the dangers from air attack (which, it must be assumed, might occur at any hour of the day or night) in which high explosive bombs, incendiary bombs or poison gas may be used*The degree of danger will not be the same in all parts of the country.      Large and densely populated cities, seaports and manufacturing centres are much more liable to air attack than less populous or rural areas.      Broadly speaking, the north and west of the country is less vulnerable than the east and south,  though no part of the country is beyond the range of air attacko      In some cases,  the existence of military objectives may render an area more liable to attack than it would otherwise he.5.      First consideration must he. given to those places where, for one reason or another,  the risk of air attack must be regarded as so great that it would not he justifiable to collect children in large numbers in schools and it will accordingly be decided to close the schools during the whole period for which raids may be expected.      The short period of warning, referred to further below, will not suffice to enable
children to be sent home from school when a raid immediately threatens ana the primary importance of their safety will demand that they should be kept at home  to share in the protective arrangements designed for the general public60      In these areas which are especially exposed, to danger the ideal solution would be to evacuate the children, -not all of whom will be of school age, - to safer districts, preferably iii the country;, where  they could be dispersed in private houses or&quot; public bull dings or possibly in small campso The difficulties of any such scheme are obvious5 but they should not prevent its careful consideration.      Details would have to be worked out beforehand (and. the consent of the parents obtained), as part of the general scheme of Air Raid Precautions for the district, and in co-operation with the authorities for the districts to which the children would be transferred.      The Home Office would be prepared to advise authorities, so far as possible, in the preparation of schemes for the purposes *7.      In the places which are not specially exposed to risk and in which accordingly it may be thought reasonable to keep the schools open (apart from those schools which it may be found necessary to use as air raid posts, decontamination centres, etc., see paragraph 14 below) it will*    It is not possible to anticipate the ways in which war conditions would affect the work of the Local Education Authorities^    but it may be assumed that suitable adjustments would be made in the basis on which Government Grants are paid to Local Authorities in order to meet the varying conditions which might prevail in an emergency,,

be necessary to plan in advance the steps to be  taken in the event9 unlikely though   it may be , of a raid occurring when the children are in schools, and regard should be had to the following considerationsc80      Firstly5 all school children will be provided, in emergency, &quot;by the Government with respirators which they will carry with them to and from schools      Children will have opportunities to become familiar with the use of respirators under the arrangements made for other members of the family, and it is undesirable that any practice or preparatory instruction of school children in peace time should be undertaken which might have adverse psychological or other effects on them or the generaD. public,      For this reason anything in the nature of respirator drill or air raid drill, on the lines of the present fire drill, should not be undertaken in school except after very careful consideration.      In fact it is considered better that no action involving the participation of the children themselves (except instruction at home in the use of the respirator) should be taken until it becomes absolutely necessary:    and it is hoped that such a situation may never occur,9c      Secondly,  the period of warning of attack is an important factor to be taken into account.      If, as at present seems likely, not more than 7-10 minutes warning will be given of an impending raid, then it would be impossible for very many, probably for most children, especially those attending secondary schools,  to get from the schools to their homes before the attack begins, and when an air raid is in progress the last place for any person to be in is the street.      It is possible that a warning might be given while the children were on their way to school:    in such circumstances it is probably
&quot;better that the children should return home at once unless they are quite near to school and that instructions to this effect should he given to them in advance*10.      In the third place school children heing under discipline may he expected to carry out readily any instructions given to them hy the teaching staff should the necessity arise, This heing so it appears sufficient safeguard at this stage for plans . to &quot;be worked out so that the action to he taken in an emergency is known hy the responsihle teachers in each school which may he occupied hy children at such a time.      It is not suggested that teachers should endeavour to train themselves in the technical methods of protection, decontamination and the like:    such matters are best left to the Air Said Precautions services, units of which will be distributed at convenient points in each locality and will be specially instructed for the work.   -  The address of the nearest posts&apos; to be summoned in case of need should, of course, be known to the teachers of each school and in time of war should be kept prominently affixed in the head teacher&apos;s room or some other appropriate place.     At the same time it would be a distinct advantage if a proportion of the teachers at each school were willing to acquire some elementary knowledge of first-aid treatment of wounds and gas cases and of anti-gas precautions generally, in order to be able to give immediate first-aid to any casualties among children.11.     Finally there is the question of structural precautions in schools.      In general the construction and planning of schools do not lend themselves to effective measures of protection and the alterations required for the purpose would not only be costly but might involve serious and permanent loss of amenities, especially in respect of
lighting and ventilation.     Moreover, the problem of controlling and supervising large numbers of children, who should in times of danger never be assembled in groups of more than 50 in any one gas and splinter-proof room or compartment, would present grave difficulties.      Since, therefore, it is not anticipated that children will be attending school in areas where the probability of air attack might otherwise be held to justify the heavy expenditure and sacrifice of making the &quot;buildings safer for their use, structural precautions are only contemplated in exceptional cases.There are, however, areas which for example, while not likely to be the objectives of air attack, are on the probable route of air craft,  or places which though comparatively remote contain munition works or the like which might attract isolated raids.      In such cases it may be found possible and considered desirable, especially when planning new schools and reconstructing existing schools, to adopt some precautionary measures such as the provision of shelter trenches or the protection of rooms against gas or splinters from bombs.      Careful arrangements would of course have to be made beforehand by the Local Authority in co-operation with the teachers so that on an emergency arising the shelter provided could quickly be put in a state of defence and the children assembled in it under proper control.     Where the provision of shelter trenches is considered desirable in connexion with a new school,  the question should be kept in mind when the Authority are deciding how much ground should be acquired, and are planning the general lay-out of the site,  so that the shelter trenches may be suitably placed in relation to theschool buildings without restricting the space available for games and recreation.      Conditions will vary considerably6c
from school to school hut the Rome Office will he prepared to assist with suggestions when required.      The Board of Education are prepared to recognise for their grant expenditure incurred hy Local Education Authorities in the incorporation of protective measures in suitable cases.IS.      The foregoing paragraphs relate mainly to day schools.      In a hoarding school it may be assumed that all or nearly all pupils are some distance from home, and it is on all grounds advisable that they should remain at the school. Apart from the importance of education heing as little interrupted as possible, many schools are situated in areas probably less dangerous than the pupils&apos;  homeso      It is therefore recommended that Boarding schools in such places should not he closed unless any special circumstances appear to make this course necessary0. Y .13o      Those hoarding schools which are situated in areas which might he particularly liable to attack, especially any which are located in large towns, would require to he considered individually, and it is strongly urged that schools which can definitely he regarded as in speciallj/&quot; dangerous localities should he evacuated.      It is suggested that in some cases it might he possible, by a process of affiliation, for a school in a dangerous position to amalgamate temporarily with a school in a safer part of the country.      The difficulties of such a scheme, which would inevitably involve some inconvenience and discomfort, are apparent, and arrangements for accommodation, transport and supply would have to be worked out carefully beforehand in peace time.      Where, however, it could be contrived it would have very great advantages.
14-      It will be convenient to refer here to the necessity which will arise in certain cases for the use of schools in the schemes of air raid precautions for the general public Schools do offer particular facilities for first aid. posts, and the air raid precautions requirements of the country will demand a large number of such posts.      It is difficult to find buildings having the necessary facilities, and it may well be that in time of emergency a certain number of schools will be required in the national interest to be used as first aid posts.      In some such cases it may be desirable to make structural alterations in the schools so that they can be used for this purpose:    any proposals to this end will be considered on their merits, but it will be understood that expenditure involved would not rank for grant from the Board of Education,      These arrangements will all be planned in peace time, and buildings other than schools should be used wherever possible in those areas where it has been decided that the schools should, continue in working during war time.      In any case where it is found necessary in such cases to use a school some alternative arrangements for continuing the education of the children should, if possible, be made by the Local Education Authority in consultation with His Majesty&apos;s Inspector,8c
