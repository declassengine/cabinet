Printed for the Cabinet.  July 1937.SECEET. Copy &quot;Mb.CP. 181 (37).CABINET.FILM QUOTA LEGISLATION.Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.MY colleagues will recollect that they have already accepted (Cabinet 18 (37), Conclusion 4) the principal recommendation of the Moyne Committee that the Cinematograph Films Act, 1927, when it expires next year, should be extended for a further period of ten years on the same general lines, i.e., that Renters of films should be obliged to acquire and Exhibitors to show a certain proportion of British films. An announcement to this effect was made in Parliament on the 22nd April.2. Discussions have been proceeding on this basis between the Board of Trade and the three sections of the industry for some months. The Producers, Renters and Exhibitors have also been encouraged to hold a series of joint meetings in the hope that they would be able to agree upon a scheme in which, although there would certainly have been some difference of view on matters of detail, fundamental principles would have been agreed, Their interests have, however, proved too divergent to enable them to agree even upon any point of principle, except the basic idea of a quota; and it is therefore necessary for the Government to proceed with their own proposals.3. Proposed Films Commission. The recommendations of the Moyne Committee centred round the appointment of a Films Commission, consisting of persons independent of the trade, which would administer the new legislation generally and also have powers of &quot; initiative and control&quot; over a wide range of questions. Such little support as this proposal has received from the trade seems to depend on a belief that the Commission would be invested with much wider powers than Parliament would be willing to grant. The proposal, moreover, has the grave disadvantage that a Minister would have to be responsible in Parliament for the acts of a Body over which he would not have effective control. I therefore suggest that this particular recommendation of the Moyne Committee be disregarded, and that the administering authority for the new legislation should continue to be the Board of Trade, assisted by an Advisory body on the lines of the Committee established under the present Act. I may add that certain functions which the Moyne Committee recommended that the Commission should exercise, e.g., the viewing of films for quality and the annual assessment of quota, will not be necessary under the proposals outlined below.4. The main points of disagreement in the trade on which I am asking for the decision of my colleagues are : (a) The nature of the test to be applied before a British film can count for renter&apos;s quota.(&amp;) The amount of the renter&apos;s and exhibitor&apos;s quotas for long films, (c) The necessity for quotas for short films.[15556] B
I. The Institution of a Quality Test.5. The main criticism of the present Act is that the foreign controlled Renters, who handle over 50 per cent, of imported films, have met their quota obligations by the acquisition of British films made as cheaply as possible, regardless of quality. Such films are known in the trade as &quot; quota quickies &quot; and do so much to discredit British production as a whole that a. major objective of the new legislation must be to abolish them. The new legislation must therefore include some test to be applied before a film can be allowed to count for renter&apos;s quota.6. The Moyne Committee recommended that this test should be a viewing test carried out by the Films Commission, and in this they are supported by the Exhibitors. The Producers and Renters, on the other hand, are in favour of a test based on cost, and the same view is taken by the Trade Union organisation concerned and by the Body representing the technicians.The Exhibitors argue that if Renters are obliged to spend a minimum sum of money on their Britsh quota films they will restrict their Importations of the cheaper American pictures, and that the choice of foreign films open to Exhibitors will accordingly be curtailed. This, they claim, will operate not against the theatre circuits, who with their strong booking power will be able to obtain all the films they require, but against the small independent Exhibitor. I am inclined to doubt whether any material reduction in imports will result, but in so far as it does it will offer better booking opportunities to medium cost British films.7. Cost cannot, of course, be an infallible criterion of quality, but if a renter is obliged to arrange for the production of a film costing a reasonable minimum in order to fulfil his quota obligations it seems to me a fair assumption that he will take all practicable steps to secure one of sufficiently good quality to command a satisfactory number of bookings. Although the viewing by an independent committee would provide a more satisfactory test from a theoretical point of view, it would inevitably introduce a much greater element of uncertainty into film production; and one result of accepting this recommendation of the Moyne Committee would therefore be to add vastly to the difficulty of financing British film production in itself at present a serious problem. I have carefully weighed the various arguments for and against the cost test and on balance I am proposing to my colleagues that such a test should be adopted in principle.8. The Renters and a majority of the Producers&apos; organisation agree that the minimum cost for a British quota film should be  15,000. A minority of the producers (mainly the smaller producers) suggest a minimum of  9,000 with an average in respect of each renter of  15,000. I propose that the  15,000 basis should be adopted, but that, for administrative reasons, the actual criterion should not be the total cost of the film but the amount expended on wages and salaries. It is generally agreed in the trade that&quot; on the average labour costs represent half the total cost of a film, and the test proposed for a quota film is therefore that it should cost a minimum of  7,500 in wages and salaries.9. It must be emphasised that this test would only apply to such British films as are required by Renters to offset their imported films. For the rest, Producers will be at liberty to spend less than the minimum if they so desire, the films thus made being registered for exhibitors&apos; quota only and booked on their merits. There will be no obligation on Exhibitors to show films which have complied with the cost test, and it will be open to them to meet their quota obli-gations in whole or in part by exhibiting films costing less than the minimum sum. I hope that one of the effects of the Act will be to encourage the production of such British films to take the place of the poorer American production which it may ho longer be profitable to import.10. Moreover, I propose that it shall be open to any Producer or Renter to apply for the registration for renters&apos; quota of a film costing less than the minimum on the; ground of entertainment value. These two provisos should in large measure safeguard the position of the smaller Producers referred to above who mostly have affiliated renting organisations dealing more with British than with imported films.
II. Amount of the Quota for Long Films.14. Under the existing Act a Renter is.at present obliged to acquire and an Exhibitor to show 20 per cent, of British films calculated on the length of all the films which he acquires or shows as the case may be. The Moyne Committee recommended that the initial quotas should be 20 per cent, in the case of Renters and 15 per cent, in the case of Exhibitors, and that these quotas should be assessed annually, the ultimate aim being quotas of 50 per cent, in the ten-year period. The recommendation for a 50 per cent, quota may be accepted as an ideal, but there is general agreement, even on the part of Producers, that it cannot be attained within the ten-year period. There is also general agreement in the trade that there must be some gap between the Renters&apos; and Exhibitors&apos; quotas so as [15556] 1 b 211. The Renters have contended that if the quota is in units of  15,000 a film costing  30,000 should count twice for quota and so on in arithmetical progression up to a limit of  60,000. One of the objects of the new legislation is to encourage the production of films which will find a market not only in this country but abroad, and there is accordingly something to be said for offering to Renters some practical inducement to make a more costly film which must be shown in the United States and other foreign countries if they are to recover their expenditure. If the Renters&apos; proposal were adopted and they took full advantage of it it would in the extreme lead to a considerable reduction in the output of British films. I think, however, that it would be desirable to go part of the way with them, and I propose that films costing a minimum of  45,000 (or  22,500 in labour costs) should count twice for quota. The Exhibitors object to this pro-posal (which may lead to some reduction in the numbers of British films) unless films which count twice for renters&apos; quota are also counted twice for exhibitors&apos; quota. Any such concession would, however, give rise to serious anomalies, and I cannot recommend that it should be granted. The Exhibitors, I think, are amply covered by the margin between the renters&apos; and exhibitors&apos; quotas, and by the choice open to them of exhibiting films registered for exhibitors&apos; quota only.12. The Producers have strongly urged that some provision should be made in the Bill for what is known as &quot; reciprocity.&quot; It must be borne in mind that one of the principal disadvantages under which British films labour is that the U.SA. market is practically closed to them except in a few special cases. This is partly due to the resistance of the United States producers, who also control the theatres in key positions; and to a certain extent to the unsuitability of particular British films for the American market. The limited revenue available from the market in the United Kingdom and some parts of the Empire makes it difficult for Producers to undertake more ambitious schemes, and it is most important that every practicable step should be taken to assist them in entering the American market. The producers propose that where a Renter acquires the rights for one foreign country for a minimum sum of  20,000 of a British film, he should be allowed to count the acquisition of those foreign rights as equal to the acquisition of a British film. Under such a proposal, the Renter who holds the United Kingdom rights of the film would not, himself, how-ever, be able to count the film for quota purposes, and no Renter would be permitted to meet more than one-half of his quota obligations by this method. The real object of such a scheme is to secure the exhibition of British films in the United States, and not merely to enable a foreign controlled Renter to meet his obligations by a series of payments for the foreign rights of British films, which would either not be shown in America at all or would be a bad advertisement for British films. It follows, therefore, that the payment made must be substantial and in relation to a fairly expensive British production. I therefore propose that where a Renter acquires the rights for one foreign country of a British film costing a minimum of  45,000 (or  22,500 in labour costs) for a minimum sum of  20,000, he should be permitted to count the acquisition of those rights as equivalent to the acquisition of one British quota film.13. As regards the cost test and the reciprocity proposals, some flexibility is necessary in the figures adopted, and I suggest that the Board of Trade should have power, by Order, to be confirmed by Parliament, to vary these figures as necessary in either direction within limits to be laid down in the Act.
to provide the latter with a margin of choice. The Producers are in favour of quotas of 20 per cent, on the Renter and 15 per cent, on the Exhibitor; the Renters, who represent the United States film producers, favour 10 per cent, and 5 per cent., and the Exhibitors 15 per cent, and 10 per cent. It appears at first sight to be open to considerable political objection to begin the-new Act by lowering the quota, especially as Exhibitors as a whole were showing over 29 per cent, of British films during the year ended the 30th September, 1936. The introduction, however, of the cost test referred to above materially alters the situation. The new legislation will not be through Parliament until the early months of 1938, and as the new renters&apos; quota year starts on the 1st April there is little time to make adequate preparations for the production of large number of films of better quality than have hitherto been made. Moreover, there is some doubt whether sufficient personnel, especially on the technical side, is at present available if, side by side with the production of films for quota purposes by importers of foreign films, British production independent of quota considerations continues to make progress.  The courses open are : (a) to start with quotas of 20 per cent, on the Renter and 15 per cent, on theExhibitor, and to postpone the operation of the cost test for the first year of the new Act. This, in effect, means another year of &quot; quota quickies,&quot; or(b) to start with initial quotas of 15 per cent, on the Renter and 10 per cent.on the Exhibitor.The real objection to &quot; quota quickies &quot; is not that they are bad films, but that they never attempted to be good. In many cases the main interest of the producer of the film is in making it for as much below the price which the renter has contracted to pay as he reasonably can. This is a vicious system which it is considered should be abolished at the earliest possible moment. I suggest, for my colleagues&apos; consideration, that the second of the courses outlined above should be adopted, and that initial quotas of 15 per cent, and 10 per cent, should be adopted, rising to 20 per cent, and 15 per cent, in the second year of the new Act. Thereafter, I suggest that the quota should proceed by stages to 30 per cent, on Renters and 25 per cent, on Exhibitors.15. There is general agreement that in a trade like the film trade, where new and rapid developments constantly occur, there must be some degree of flexibility. As already stated, the Moyne Committee recommended an annual assessment of quota. Such a method would, however, introduce too great an element of uncertainty into the industry and would involve the Government in an annual battle between the three sections of the industry as to the amount of quota. To meet the need for some flexibility, however, I suggest that the Board of Trade should have power, by Order to be confirmed by Parliament, to vary in either direction the quotas at intervals of three years within the limits for the second year (20 per cent, and 15 per cent.) and the final limits laid down in the Act.III. Quota for short films.16. Under the present Act there is no separate quota for short films. i.e., those under 3,000 feet. The Renter and Exhibitor are called upon to comply with the Act both as regards long films and all films, but they are allowed to offset imported short films by British long films. Short film production in this country is therefore at a very low ebb on the theatrical side. The Moyne Committee recommended that short film production should receive separate protection, in view both of the cultural and educational value of such films and of the training ground it provides for the feature film. They accordingly proposed initial quotas of 15 per cent, on the Renter and 10 per cent, oh the Exhibitor, with an annual assessment, as in the case of long films. Cultural and educational bodies are naturally anxious for a separate quota for short films. At the same time, as this is an entirely new development, I hope my colleagues will agree that we must feel our way. I propose that the initial quotas for short films should be 10 per cent, on Renters and 5 per cent, on Exhibitors, rising by stages over the ten-year period to 20 per cent, on Renters and 15 per cent, on Exhibitors.   At the outset I do not suggest that any cost test should be instituted.
Such a test may; however,. be found to be desirable when some experience has been gained of the working of the Act, and I propose that the Board of Trade should be given power, by order, to institute such a test if necessary.17. As in the case of long films, it will be necessary to give the Board of Trade power to vary the quotas from time to time within the statutory limits, and also to reassess within limits the cost test basis, if one is adopted.IV. Revision of the excepted classes.18. Under the present Act certain classes of films are not required to be registered, and British films of these types, e.g., news and current events, natural scenery, commercial advertisements, &amp;e, cannot be counted for quota purposes. The object was to prevent Renters acquiring cheaply-made films which require little or no studio work in their production. Much of the subject matter of short films falls within the present excepted classes. Moreover, I consider that with a cost test in the case of long films, the Producer should be free, so far as possible, of any restrictions on his choice of subject. I therefore propose that the new legislation should apply to all classes of films, except news reels and commercial advertisements.V. Treatment of Dominion films.19. Under the present Act films made anywhere in the Empire which comply with the requirements laid down for a British film are entitled to be registered, and can be counted for quota purposes in the United Kingdom. Some exception to the continuance of this provision has been taken by the Producers, who complain that equal treatment is not accorded to their films under Australian legislation. At the same time, it would probably be difficult to confine any new legislation to films made in the United Kingdom, and I accordingly propose that films made elsewhere in the Empire which can satisfy the requirements as to cost and other conditions laid down for British films should be eligible for renters&apos; quota in this country.VI. Minor Recommendations.20! The Report of the Moyne Committee contains a number of minor recommendations. In the case of many of these there is complete unanimity in the trade. As regards the remainder the observations of the various sections of the trade have been obtained, and where necessary they will be consulted not only on these recommendations but on a number of other points of detail where the experience of the Board of Trade has shown some amendment of the present Act is necessary.VII.-Summary of Proposals.21. The proposals which I have outlined above may be summarised as follows: -;-(1) That the initial quotas for long films should be 15 per cent, on Renters and 10 per cent, on Exhibitors in the first year, and 20 per cent, and 15 per cent, in the second year (paragraph 14).(2) That the Bill should include a schedule providing for a subsequent increase in renter&apos;s quota for long films to 30 per cent, and in exhibitor&apos;s quota to 25 per cent, by stages over the ten-year period (paragraph 14).(3) That, for the purposes of the renter&apos;s quota for long films, British films should be required to meet a test based on labour costs of  7,500 (paragraphs 5 to 8). pr(4) That long films costing a minimum of  22,500 in labour costs should count twice for quota (paragraph 11).(5) That where a Renter acquires for a minimum sum of  20,000 the rights for one foreign country of a British long film costing a minimum of  22,500 in labour costs it should be regarded as equivalent to the acquisition of one quota film (paragraph 12).
(6)&quot;That the Board of Trade should have power by Order to be confirmed, by Parliament (a) to vary, at three yearly intervals, in either direction the scheduledquotas within the limits of 30 per cent, and 20 per cent, in the case of the Renter, and 15 per cent, and 25 per cent, in the case of the Exhibitor (paragraph 15);(b) to vary the cost test basis for renter&apos;s quota, and the minimumsum payable for and the cost of &apos;&apos; foreign rights &apos;&apos; films within the limits laid down in the Act (paragraph 13).(7) That a separate quota should be instituted for short films; the initial quotas to be 10 per cent, on Renters and 5 per cent, on Exhibitors, with a schedule providing for a gradual increase to 20 per cent, and 15 per cent., respectively, over the ten-year period (paragraph 15).(8) That no cost test should be instituted at the outset for short films (paragraph 16).(9) That the Board of Trade should be given power by Order to be confirmed by Parliament to i(a) vary the short quotas, at three yearly intervals, within the maximaand minima limits of the schedule; and(b) institute a cost test and to vary it within limits laid down in the Act (paragraph 17).(10) That long films costing less than the minimum should be available for registration for exhibitors quota only. It would be open, however, to a Producer or Renter to apply for full quota for such a film on the ground of its &quot; special exhibition value &quot; (paragraph 10). This provision would also apply to short films if a cost test were introduced.(11) That registration under the Act should apply to all films except news reels and commercial advertisements (paragraph 17).(12) That films produced elsewhere in the Empire should be accorded similar treatment to United Kingdom films (except for the &quot; foreign rights &quot; proposal) (paragraph 19).(13) That under these proposals the Board of Trade would continue to be assisted in the administration of the Act by an Advisory Committee constituted on the same lines as the present Committee (paragraph 3).&apos; 22. I ask for authority for the preparation of the Bill and for its submission to the Home Affairs Committee as soon as it is drafted. I would remind my colleagues that the present Act expires, so far as renters are concerned, at the end of March 1938 and that it is therefore important that the Bill should be introduced into the House of Commons early in the new Session.23. In view of the public interest on the subject of films I suggest that it would be useful if a White Paper were to be published explaining in some detail the Government^ proposals and I accordingly ask for authority to issue such a paper as soon as the Cabinet has reached its decisions.O. F. G. S.Board of Trade, S.W.1, July 8, 1937.
