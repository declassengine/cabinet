THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.. June 1937. &apos;MOST SECRET. Copy No.   50CP; 165 (37).TO BE&apos; KEPT UNDER LOCK . AND KEY..It is requested that special care may be taken to ensure the secrecy of this document.CABINET.DEFENCE EXPENDITURE.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.I.IN the concluding weeks of his Chancellorship the Prime Minister was engaged in a study of the Defence Programme as a whole, present and prospective, in terms of our resources. As he was unable to complete this examination it falls to me to submit its results to my- colleagues and I shall add certain recommendations,2. Assuming the continuance of (a) the present very high rates of taxation and (b) the growth of prosperity on which the efficacy of taxation depends, I estimate that the amount of revenue available for the three Defence Services in the five years 1937-8 to 1941-2 will be  1,100 millions. During the same period  400 millions may be borrowed under the Defence Loans Act. In the aggregate, therefore, on this assumption  1,500 millions should be available over the five years. If there is a set-back in trade indeed, if prosperity does not increase  the sum available is likely to be less arid even very substantially less.II.3. After the conclusion of the programme (which for the moment I assume to be at the end of 1941-2) the payment of interest and sinking fund for the Defence Loans must be met and some provision must be made annually towards the systematic redemption of the National Debt. The new National Defence Contri-bution is a temporary tax and will by then have been repealed. Some diminution of trade even if not a serious, one must be contemplated on the cessation of abnormal rearmament orders. Though figures at such a distance of time are conjectural, it would be most unwise to assume that even in favourable circum-stances and even with general taxation maintained at its existing levels-and it is doubtful if it can be so maintained more than  150 millions to  170 millions will be annually available for Defence. I take this figure, therefore- 150- l70 millions- as the total amount assumed to be available for the maintenance of our enlarged forces when the five-year programme is over, and for any periodic replacement,III.4.   The figures of cost of the Defence Programme are complicated and baffling.  In order to see what is really happening, it is necessary to state the main [15451]

Since the introduction of the Defence Loans Bill in February last, the cost of the Army Programme as approved (subject to, qualifications) has risen from  177 millions to  214 millions; while proposals for additions to the programme are still under consideration which would add a further  43 millions plus another large but undefined amount. &apos;The latest, forecast of the cost of the Navy and Air Force Programmes is referred to in paragraphs 14 and15 below.8. New demands have also been made for services connected with defence preparations, but outside the scope of Defence Votes, viz..: A. Year A go.

Figures such as these indicate the pace at which the cost to be met continues to grow and show that there is at present no trace of finality   We are running the gravest risks if we do not resolutely insist on correlating the rising total burden of Defence liabilities to the whole of our available resources   Indeed the means of correlation is, under existing practice, rapidly breaking down.IV.tt 10. In the White Paper issued on the 16th February last it was stated that taking the programme as it stands to-day it would be imprudent to contemplate a, total expenditure on defence during the next five years of much less than  1,500 millions.&quot; The figure, it will he seen, corresponds with that named in paragraph 2 above, and must be regarded as a maximum.* This sum bears indications of being only a beginning.facts in a bald and summary way.. The point to which I must direct the special attention of my colleagues is the rate at which totals are increasing, and the absence of any finality..5.

This represented an average of about  32 millions a year, which is about double the rate of expenditure required to maintain in being such a fleet as the Defence Requirements Committee Report aimed at.6. In January 1937, when further calculations were made for the purpose of the Defence Loans Bill, it was estimated that the eapital cost had increased to the following extent: 
3 fi11. Defence Departments were not asked to submit estimates of their total expenditure for each year of the quinquennium 1937-41, before this figure was published. Indeed, it was understood that Departments were unwilling to frame estimates as to the incidence of cost of the Defence Programme over the next few years until further experience had been gained of its progress. The figure of  1,500 millions was based on a general examination by the Treasury of the cost of the programme as revealed in January 1937.12. In the months which have elapsed since this figure of  1,500 million was published, a good deal has happened over and above the increases and new demands referred to in paragraphs 5-8 above.13. In the first place the period required for completion of the programme is becoming more nebulous, and uncertain and requires to&quot;be re-examined.14. In the second place, evidence is accumulating that the probable cost of maintenance of the three Services when the present programme has been completed will be vastly in excess of any figure which was suggested when the programme was started a little over a year ago. Thus the Third Defence Require-ments Committee Report gave a figure of  16 millions as the total increase in the annual recurrent charges of all three Services (excluding Naval Construction) resulting from the adoption of the Defence Requirements Committee Report by March 1941. [The original Defence Estimates for 1935-36 the year before the programme was instituted -amounted to a total of approximately  124 millions.] It is clear that these figures are now completely out-of-date. Thus in the paper recently submitted by the Admiralty to the Defence Plans (Policy) Committee, it was stated that the stabilised annual cost of maintenance of the Fleet to which the Admiralty are now building up on the approved programme is  88 millions.*15. A forecast has also been submitted by the Secretary of State for Air which shews that, on the basis of the present approved policy, Air Estimates will reach  100 millions during the years 1938 and 1939, and will then decline to a stabilised figure of, say,  75 millions about 1944. If Scheme H were;to be implemented in its entirety, Air Force Estimates would reach  115 millions in the years 1938, 1939 and 1940, while the stabilised annual cost, to be reached by about 1944, would be about  90 millions.16. Corresponding figures for the Army have been asked for, but have not yet been submitted.17. These figures, which have only recently been received, represent a forecast of the total expenditure on the Navy and Air Force, and as such do not provide the necessary material for detailed examination by the Treasury; it is also evident that these figures will require to be reconsidered in the light of the period over which the programme is to be completed and of our available resources. It seems clear, however, that, whatever decision is taken as to the period over which the programme is to be completed, we cannot afford to meet the current cost of maintenance of the reorganised Forces at the level which they will have reached when the programmes have been completed except at an intolerable level of taxation or after a startling reversal of accepted policy in regard to social expenditure. It will be appreciated that there is no surer way to bankruptcy than to allow temporary borrowing for a capital purpose to merge into permanent borrowing for current needs, and that solution must he ruled out at once.: ;ir...     v.    ;\18. In these general circumstances, which involve dealing with an indefinite series of new and very costly demands coming forward as soon as .they happen to be prepared without correlation with each other, there is more than a risk that the normal methods both of Cabinet and of Treasury control will be completely stultified.   I think, therefore, that the time has come both for a general review* In the sarfie paper the total expenditure on Navy Votes for the seven years 1938-44 is given as  675 millions on the basis of,the present approved programme, and as ,-6800 millions if the Admiralty -/Proposals for the:; new standard of Naval Strength are adopted, i.e., an annual average expenditure of  96 millions (or  114 millions) over this period of seven years.
of the position and for the introduction of a procedure additional to the normal arrangements for Cabinet approval, and the ordinary processes of Treasury control, of expenditure on defence.      &quot;.19.   I accordingly recommend (a) that the Defence Departments should be asked, in consultation with the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence,(1) to estimate anew the period of time required for the completion oftheir programmes, (2) on the basis of the programme as now sanctioned and of the risingtrend of prices to submit estimates of their total requirementsof voted-money year by year during that period, and (3) on the like basis to submit estimates of their normal total annual expenditure in the years following the completion of theprogramme;(6) that these general estimates should then be examined by the Treasury;(c) that after such examination the estimates, together with the observations of the Treasury, should be submitted to the Defence Policy and Requirements Committee of the Cabinet (with possibly extended terms of reference), which would, in the light of all the circumstances^(see paragraph 20 below), determine priorities between conflicting claims and recommend to the Cabinet maxima for the expenditure by each Department year by year during the period of the programme, such maxima not to be.exceeded except by further authority; : (d) that in the meanwhile decisions on new projects of major importance should be&quot; postponed.20. While in this note I have confined myself to a brief exposition of the relation of the programmes to our Exchequer resources available out of taxation or loans, this is only one aspect of the problem. Ultimately our resources have to be measured in terms of man power, productive capacity, and the maintenance of the balance of our general trade, without which our imports of essential raw materials and food could not be obtained. These matters cannot be excluded from any review of the problem.VI.J. S.Treasury Chambers, Whitehall, S. W. t, June 25, 1937.
