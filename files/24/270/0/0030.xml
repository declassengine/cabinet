Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1937.SECRET. Copy No.CP. 185 (37).CABINET.ARABIC BROADCASTS.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.FOR some time past the interests and the reputation of this country in the Near and Middle East have suffered from the lack of any suitable broadcasting agency in that area. The popularity of the wireless has been growing rapidly, and although the number of private listeners may still be small, there has been a great increase in the number of loud-speakers set up in the cafes which in every town and village are the centres for the exchange of news. Our political rivals have not been slow in taking advantage of this new propaganda medium; in particular, the Italian wireless station at Bari has, during the last few years, made a practice of broadcasting in Arabic news and views favourable to the Italian cause. The Bari programme ranges from recognisable, but strongly biased, accounts of recent events, and declarations of Italy&apos;s sympathy with the Moslem world, to poisonous and violent anti-British fabrications. Examples of these last are numerous and need not be quoted here; several have lately been cited in the press. Erom time to time representations have been made to the Italian Govern-ment and the tone of Bari has for a while improved; little, however, has been done to ensure a positive presentation of the British point of view to the Arabs by means of the wireless, the only propaganda of this kind being the use made of the British Broadcasting Corporation^ Empire news bulletins and of Reuter&apos;s news service by the Palestine broadcasting station, and the occasional exercise of influence on the Egyptian broadcasting station at Cairo. Meanwhile, enquiry shows that the Italian broadcasts, even if they are not taken at their face value and occasionally even excite ridicule by their exaggerations, do by their very persistence end by creating, if not a feeling in favour of Italy, at least a prejudice against Great Britain.The time has now come when some more. positive step should be taken than that of asking the Italians to desist. Without attempting to imitate the tone or the methods of Bari, it is essential for His Majesty&apos;s Government to ensure the full and forcible presentation of the British view of events in a region of such vital imperial importance. The Foreign Office have, therefore, discussed this matter in detail with the Colonial Office and the British Broadcasting Corpora-tion, and have reached the following conclusions : To reach the great mass of Arab listeners, any broadcast must be delivered in Arabic and on a medium wave, since it goes without saying that very few of the hearers understand English and the wireless sets employed by the cafes cannot for the most part receive direct the high-power emissions from London or Daventry : Bari is itself a medium-wave station and medium-wave receiving sets are much cheaper and easier to work than the short-wave set which would be necessary to listen-in direct to London. The only two medium-wave stations in the Near and Middle East are Jerusalem and Cairo, and of these only Jerusalem can be counted upon for the purpose in view, as any attempt to exert a continuous influence over the Cairo station would meet with resistance. The only immediate step which can be taken is, in consequence, to ensure that any information which9381   [15578]
it is desired to make public is broadcast from Jerusalem. The Jerusalem station already runs a news service and,, as mentioned above, makes use of the Empire news bulletins of the British Broadcasting Corporation : it also uses Reuter. Neither of these news services is entirely satisfactory from the present point of view: it is not in any case the specific duty of either of them to keep track of foreign propaganda with a view to contradicting it. The British Broadcasting Corporation would no doubt be willing to insert in the trans-mission which includes the Near Eastern&quot; countries additional news items supplied from Governmental sources; since, however, any such items would in any case have to be translated and re-broadcast in Jerusalem, there seems no necessity to enlist their help. A &quot;more expeditious procedure would be the following. A special officer with first-hand experience of Arab mentality would be attached to the News Department of the Foreign Office, with the duty, first, of following the output of any anti-British wireless propaganda in the Near and Middle East; secondly, of collecting, or receiving from other Government Depart-ments, any items of news to which from the British point of view it is desirable to give a wide circulation in that area; and thirdly, of drafting in news bulletin form any such information or any announcements designed to counteract foreign propaganda. The bulletins so produced would be telegraphed to Palestine, where they would be translated into Arabic and broadcast, though not necessarily in the exact form in which they were sent.This, as has been said, is, in existing circumstances, the only action which can be taken to counter foreign wireless propaganda, and the approval of the Cabinet is sought for its immediate adoption. The total cost involved would probably be small, involving salaries for a staff of two in London and possibly one extra man in Jerusalem, and the cost of the messages themselves whether sent by cable or wireless. In one respect, however, this proposal represents an unsatisfactory compromise. Jerusalem is, and, so far as can be seen, is likely to remain, in mandated territory and for that reason it will never be possible to make the fullest use of the broadcasting station there. What is required is a medium-wave station under British control, that is to say on British territory, which, besides relaying the Daventry programmes, could give programmes of its own in Arabic or any other foreign language. The most suitable site for such a station would undoubtedly be Cyprus, from which all parts of the Levant and the Near and Middle East could be easily reached. From the imperial point of view such a station would be of the greatest use not only in the Arabic-speaking countries but in Cyprus itself and the Greek-speaking countries as well, including in the latter Egypt with its large Greek population. It is worth mentioning in this connexion that a large German-built station is soon to be erected at Athens and it may be desirable that this should not be the only centre of attraction for Cypriot listeners.The construction of a station in Cyprus would free British broadcasting in this area from the restrictions which attach to the use of a station in mandated territory and consequently one which cannot be regarded as primarily designed for the service of British interests; it would make available to a very much larger audience the present programmes of the British Broadcasting Corporation, including the broadcasts of great events in British national life; it ought also to provide for the inhabitants of the various countries served programmes of local interest such as they at present can only receive, if at all,, from sources indifferent, or opposed, to British needs; finally, it would afford a standing guarantee that in this, as in other spheres, we would not in future allow any unfriendly Power to attack us with impunity. The total cost of erecting such a station is estimated at not more than  50,000 and the period of erection at approximately nine months. Both capital and maintenance costs would, it is felt, have to be borne mainly by the Home Exchequer, as contributions from Cyprus would be negligible in amount. The approval of the Cabinet is also sought for this further measure in principle and subject to examination by the Departments concerned of the technical and other details involved. .A.
