THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT1Printed for the Cabinet.   June 1937.SECEET. Copy., No. zf.][CP. 158 (37).GABINET.ENQUIRY INTO THE POSSIBILITIES OF REMOVING OBSTACLES TO INTERNATIONAL TRADE UNDERTAKEN BY THE BELGIAN PRIME MINISTER AT THE REQUEST OF THE UNITED KINGDOM AND FRENCH GOVERNMENTS.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I CIRCULATE to my colleagues a note on the first stage in the mission of M. Frere, who, under the instructions of M. van Zeeland, is carrying out an enquiry in the principal European countries as to the practicability of the adoption of more liberal economic policies, and especially of the relaxation or suppression of quota restrictions and exchange controls. This note covers M. Frere&apos;s preliminary visits to Berlin, The Hague, Paris, Berne and Rome; and it contains matter of considerable interest. I wish to endorse his request that the information which he has so kindly and freely imparted and the views of the individuals with whom he spoke should be regarded as absolutely confidential.A. E.June 9, 1937.(Very Secret.)M. Frere&apos;s Mission.AT an interview with Sir Frederick Leith-Ross and certain other British officials, on the 27th May, 1937, M. Frere gave an account of his recent visits to Berlin, The Hague, Paris, Berne and Rome.It will be remembered that in February last M. van Zeeland was invited by the United Kingdom and French Governments to explore the possibility of giving effect to the provision in the Tripartite Agreement of September last in favour of the general relaxation or suppression of quota restrictions and exchange controls. M. van Zeeland arranged with us that, in the first instance, he would send M. Frere (a Belgian economist, well known to us, who was formerly adviser to the National Bank of Austria) to interview the responsible statesmen and officials in the principal European countries so as to ascertain their respective standpoints and see if they can be fitted together into a common programme. M. Frere has accordingly visited Paris, Berlin, Rome, Berne and The Hague in turn : and though he is not yet in a position to make any definite report, he came to London to inform us of his first impressions. He spoke very freely, and was most anxious that his remarks should be regarded as absolutely confidential. The fact of its being known that he had spoken so freely to the British authorities might seriously prejudice his mission.Germany.In Berlin, M. Frere found Dr. Schacht insistent as usual upon some degree of satisfaction for Germany&apos;s colonial claims, though in the course of a second interview Dr. Schacht moderated his demand for a transfer of territory to one for 9297   [15367]
a colonial leasehold, say, on 99 years&apos; tenure, without transfer of sovereignty, but (no doubt) with currency control. In view of this distinction, Dr. Schacht insisted that Germany&apos;s colonial claim was an economic and not a political one. In return for Germany receiving &apos;&apos; colonial territories which could improve her conditions of existence,&quot; Dr. Schacht stated his readiness to negotiate a general pact providing for (1) freer international trade;(2) relaxation leading to suppression of quotas;(3) progressive re-establishment of freedom of exchange.Dr. Schacht asked M. Frere to take note of this offer in writing.Dr. Schacht added that Germany put no political conditions. Colonial territories were an economic necessity, and the need for them could be met without change of frontiers. If political conditions were raised, it would be by others, who would probably ask Germany to disarm and to return to the League. In that event, Germany would ask for the suppression of article 16 of the Covenant, but Germany would not herself raise these political questions; she would leave that to others.If once the colonial question were settled, Dr. Schacht said, the problem of getting rid of exchange controls would become simple, though there must necessarily be a transitional period. As regards devaluing the mark, he confessed that he would do this, though he spoke of it with obvious reluctance. Currency stabilisation, he said, must be a necessary condition of a general agreement. Germany&apos;s gold reserves must be reconstituted; and the residual reparation claims under the Lausanne Agreement must be renounced. But all these were secondary matters; the decisive question was the colonial one.M. Frere also saw General Goring, whose attitude was different from that of Dr. Schacht on certain essential points; in some respects it was more accom-accommodating. He told M. Frere that Dr. Schacht had placed too much emphasis on the colonial claim. Dr. Schacht had also, at M. Frere&apos;s first interview, referred to Eupen and Malmedy, to Schleswig and to Danzig as points where adjustments would be desirable, though Germany would never make war for them. General Goring, who had a note of Dr. Schacht&apos;s remarks, said that he did not agree with everything Dr. Schacht said. For instance, as regards Eupen and Malmedy, the German Government regarded this question as settled; they wanted to be on good terms with Belgium and were pleased with their present policy.In General Goring&apos;s view, the chief political and psychological factors in the situation were :  (1) the seizure of German assets abroad during the War. The German Government were advising their people not to invest or hold fixed property abroad. They could only change this policy if a general pact were signed, by which all countries would agree to respect private property in war;(2) the disappearance &quot;of article 16. Germany must do everything possible to become independent as regards raw materials and foodstuffs in the event of &quot;war being imposed upon her.&quot; General Goring did not go so far as to say that the Four-Year Plan would be cancelled if article 16 were withdrawn, but he implied that it would be considerably relaxed, and that the Plan was really intended to build up reserves for an emergency.As regards M. van Zeeland&apos;s visit to the United States, General Goring said that the United States could not give Germany anything she particularly wanted, unless it were to renounce their boycott of Germany on the ground of anti-Jewish activities, which was a problem internal to Germany like that of the negroes in America. He added that Germany did not want a loan, though this statement-did not remove M. Frere&apos;s belief that she would take one if it were offered.M. Frere&apos;s impression was that Germany was not in extreme economic difficulties; the shortage of raw materials had not yet developed to the point where a crisis was imminent, and consequently Dr. Schacht was trying to sell his co-operation at a price. Both Dr. Schacht and General Goring, said M. Frere, seemed much clearer about what they wanted than about what they had to offer.
Dr. Schacht did not mention any specific colony, but Dr. Blessing, his right-hand man, spoke of the Cameroons. Germany could get large supplies of fats from there, and could develop the territory very quickly. Dr. Blessing thought that Dr. Schacht would take soundings about the Cameroons in Paris.Dr. Schacht said that he was strongly against any idea of annexing Austria, which was a country with a &apos;&apos; passive &apos;&apos; trade balance, and therefore would be of no help to Germany; while Czechoslovakia was a crowded country, and Germany had nothing to gain from there.France.In France, after talking with Ministers and officials, M. Frere had the conviction that the French Government were determined to maintain a free currency; but he was personally in doubt, if, prices rose substantially and the return of production diminished, whether in the long run they would be able to do so without some further devaluation. The French Government, he said, were willing to participate in international action, but they met with great resistance when it came to dealing with their industrialists and work-people. France was really dependent upon the restoration of confidence and the monetary question. If the present Government would stand up to the work-people and make them see that they must be reasonable, then confidence might be restored; but the membership of the C.G.T. had increased from 1 million to 5 million in one year, and M. Jouhaux no longer had real control of them.Asked whether the French Government showed any progress towards the removal of quotas, M. Frere said that he thought the draft law enabling customs duties to be varied administratively, which the French Government were preparing to reintroduce, after it had been rejected by the Senate, was meant to assist in getting rid of quotas. The Senate had rejected it because they were afraid it would be used to get rid of agricultural quotas. There would be great difficulty about removing agricultural quotas, though the Minister of Agriculture, who impressed M. Frere favourably, was not absolutely opposed to any international arrangement.M. Frere had, however, been assured that the French Government would be ready to renounce the quota system, at any rate as regards industrial goods, within the framework of a general international agreement ,provided (1) that they were enabled to increase certain of their tariff rates which had been consolidated in commercial treaties with Belgium, Switzerland, Italy, &amp;c.; (2) that special measures could be found to prevent dumping by certain countries, e.g., Soviet Russia, Germany, Japan; and (3) that Exchange controls could be abolished.M. Bastid, Minister of Commerce, had objected that France&apos;s difficulties were largely due to Great Britain, e.g., on account of Ottawa. The British were always urging France to reduce her duties, but they did nothing themselves in this direction. He maintained that the French protection tariff was less high than the British.From his interviews M. Frere gained the impression that industrialists and workers were united in demanding higher protection, the former to maintain profits and the latter to defend their social legislation.Throughout the discussions in Paris, stress was laid on the monetary question and the need for a restoration of &apos;&apos; monetary security &quot; by a general stabilisation of currencies.Netherlands.At The Hague M. Frere had seen Dr. Colijn and had come away with the impression that Holland would come into any general scheme and would give up quotas. Dr. Colijn was not very hopeful, though he saw some good signs. e.g., in the conclusion of the recent Sugar Agreement. He thought that the method of the Sugar Conference could be usefully applied to other things an opinion which M. Frere did not entirely share.Switzerland. &apos;M. Motta, Swiss Minister of Public Economy, told M. Frere that Switzerland was ready to participate in common action in the spirit of the recent Belgian-Swiss Commercial Agreement. In Switzerland there was, as in France, a fear of German competition helped by export premiums, and the same reluctance to
let Germany have a balance of free exchange, such as she has with the United Kingdom and Belgium. The Swiss seemed unwilling to surrender their rights to the consolidation of certain French duties. If quotas were replaced by increased duties, they might export more, but at less profit.Italy.M. Frere received a favourable impression in Italy. He had expected to hear much about Article 16 and the Rome-Berlin axis, but in fact no one had raised political points. Definitely, Italy did not want loans; but she was anxious for some form of currency stabilisation agreement, and would like, as part of such an agreement, to be able to secure some credit or support for her currency.The immediate commercial policy of Italy was to restrict imports to what they could pay for with exports. The gold and exchange reserves of the Bank of Italy had fallen to a limit below which it must not further decline j a reserve of 4 milliards of (devalued) lire was supporting a note issue of 16 milliards. The crop last year had been bad, and this year was unpromising. Italy might have to import wheat again; and her one hope of balancing her payments was in the (fortunately considerable) increase in tourist traffic.M. Frere did not think that Italy&apos;s progress towards self-sufficiency really amounted to very much. For instance, according to Signor Mussolini&apos;s speech at the Assembly of Corporations, he spoke of producing one-third of Italy&apos;s need for coal, half of her iron-ore, and a modest provision of other metals. In petrol, Italy hoped soon to be self-sufficient with supplies from Albania and from synthetic petrol. The progress in artificial wool did not appear to be very substantial.M. Frere thought that the self-sufficiency programme had a purely military basis. It was intended to enable Italy, if necessary, to hold out a few months longer against another blockade. In normal circumstances Italy could not do without foreign trade.M. Frere did not see Signor Mussolini on this occasion, though he may see him during some later visit. He saw Count Ciano, who seemed pleased that he should have come to Rome so early in his programme, and who said that Italy had nothing against participation in common action on political grounds and could be counted on to come into any effective scheme, but not into an inadequately prepared international conference.Some of the experts seemed, however, rather more sceptical. They expressed the view that multilateral agreements had no real chance of success, and that bilateral agreements were the only practical course.Great Britain.M. Frere then enquired whether the United Kingdom was prepared to make any contribution. He was informed that this took the form of our hope that we would not have to increase duties. M. Frere replied that if the United Kingdom could make a start in some form, possibly by some reduction of Imperial Preference margins, this would help other countries to come in. Everyone to whom he had spoken had mentioned three things : (1) the undesirability of an unprepared International Conference; (2) the effects of British Imperial Preferences; and (3) the need for some step towards monetary stabilisation.M. Frere is now continuing on his Mission. His intention was that his next voyage should be from Brussels to Paris, Warsaw, Prague and back to Brussels.
