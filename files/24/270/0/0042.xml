At a meeting of the Cabinet on the 7th July (Cabinet 89 (37)  conclusion 5)  I referred to the recent statement which General Hertzog had made at Bloemfontein regarding his talks with me on the subject of the transfer to the Union of the High Commission Territories in South Africa, viz.

I made a statement (Appendix II)  in the House of Commons in reply to his Bloemfontein interview a few days later, and understandthat
that he is now disposed to make no further public statement pending the receipt of the letter which I have promised to send him.      I attach a draft of this letter (Appendix III).2.      This whole question was also before the Cabinet in 1933 (see C .P .262 (33)), but it may be useful to summarise the position briefly.3.      The South Africa Act of 1909 contains a provision (Section 151) to the effect that,  on receiving addresses from the Union Rouses of Parliament requesting the transfer to the Union of the government of any of the High Commission Territories (Basutoland, the Bechuanaland Protectorate and Swaziland) the King,  on the advice of the Privy Council, may authorise such transfer subject to the terms and conditions embodied in the Schedule to the Act.    Under the terms of the Schedule the Territories after transfer are to be administered by the Prime Minister of the Union with the advice of a Commission, appointed by the Governor-General in Council, the members of which are not to be members of either House of the Union Parliament .    The Governor-General in Council is to be the legislative authority and may make laws for the Territories by Proclamation:    such Proclamations have however to be laid before the Union Parliament and must be repealed if both Houses pass resolutions to that effect0   It is also provided,  inter alia, that no land in Basutoland or any part of the native reserves in the Bechuanaland Protectorate and Swaziland shall be alienated and no differential duties or imposts shall be levied in the Union on the produce of the Territories.      In addition there are provisions for the disallowance by the King of any law made by the Governor-General in Council for the Territories, and for the reservation for the signification of His Majesty&apos;s pleasure of Union Bills amending the
the Schedule,   when the South Africa Act was passed the King would have heon advised in these matters hy Ministers in the United Kingdom hut, as explained in the draft letter to General Hertzog, (Appendix III),  these provisions have since heen affected as a result of the St a teat e of Westminster.4.      Successive Union Governments have regarded Section 151 of the South Africa Act as constituting in effect a pledge hy the United Kingdom Government that the Territories would eventually pass to the Union Government, and there can he no doubt that the underlying intention was the eventual transfer of the Territories.    On the other hand, definite pledges were given hy the responsible United Kingdom Ministers whilst the South Africa Bill was before the House of  Commons and, subsequently, to the effect that the transfer of the Territories should not take place until:-(i) the inhabitants of the  Territories,  natives as wellas Europeans,  had been consulted,  and (ii) the United Kingdom Parliament had been given a full opportunity of expressing its views. 5.      Since the  South Africa Act was passed, the question of the transfer of the Territories has been raised informally hy the Union Government on several occasions.    The story of the consequent discussions is a long, one, which I need not go into here.    The position is at present covered hy the agreement reached in 1935 between my predecessor and General Hertzog, which is embodied in an Aide-Memo ire published in Parliamentary Paper Cmd.4948 (Appendix IV).     The Aide-Memoire recalled that His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom were hound hy pledges to the inhabitants of the Territories as well as to Parliament here, and stated that His Majesty&apos;s Government in theUnited
United Kingdom did not regard the time as ripe for consulting the inhabitants,  since all their information went to show that native opinion in the Territories was very strongly opposed to transfer.     The conclusion was drawn that &quot;the policy of both Governments for the next few years should be directed to bringing about a situation in which,  if transfer were to become a matter of practical politics,  it could be effected with the full acquiescence of the populations concerned&quot; .     With this end in view it was agreed that it was important that the closest possible co-operation should be established between the Union Government and the Administrations of  the Territories,  as it&quot;appears  ...... to be an essential condition of the success ofsuch a policy that the native population should feel that the Union Government are working in concert with the local Administrations with a real and generous desire to develop and improve conditions in the Territories&apos;7.6 .    The crux of the problem involved is how to reconcile the implication in Section 151 of the South Africa    Act and the claims of the Union Government with the pledges given to the local populations and  to   Parliament.    Clearly we could not agree to the transfer of the Territories in the face of strongly expressed opposition on the part of the natives.    In any case there would be no prospect of Parliament agreeing to such action. On the other hand,  unless we can satisfy the Union Government that we have done ail that we properly can to obtain the acquiescence of the natives,  they will charge the United Kingdom Government with what amounts to a breach of faith (as indeed some South African Ministers are already disposed to do) and very serious friction would arise between the two Governments, which incidentally would probably result in serious consequences
mconsequences for the peoples of the Territories, who are dependent on the Union for their market.     The matter is one on which South African public opinion is apt to he particularly sensitive and impatient, because of the suggestion that transfer is withheld on the ground that South Africans are incapable of treating natives fairly.7.     In my opinion transfer ultimately (indeed in some cases sooner rather than later) is in fact likely to be in the best interests of the populations of the Territories.    Geographically they are a part of South Africa.   Moreover,  it roust he borne in mind that:-(1)    Economically the Territories are almost completelyagainst imports of their produce into this all important market, and at any time political pressure from producers in the Union may force the Union Government to impose even more crippling restrictions, (ii)    I believe that -in the event of transfer the Union Government would be particularly anxious to show that they could make a success of the administration of the Territories, - they would be &quot;on their mettle&quot; -and they may he expected to devote considerable sums of money to their development, (iii)     There seems no reason to suppose that the-nativesdependent on the Union as a market for theirproduce .At present severe restrictions eperatewould not he properly governed under the Union.as explained above, under the schedule of the SouthAfrica Act the Territories would not be incorporated in the Union but would be administered as separateTerritories
Territories much as they are at present under laws made by Proclamation.     Many observers assert that Union administration in the similar native area of Transkei, which is under their rule to-day, does not compare unfavourably with much of our Colonial Administration. I have reason to believe that if transfer were to take place the Union Government would be willing to take over the whole of the personnel of the present Administrations.      Objections which have been raised in this country to transfer, based partly upon certain treatment of the natives in the Union proper, and partly upon recent Union legislation relating to the native franchise, are not strictly relevant.  As regards the franchise the   natives    do not enjoy this at present, and under    the   s p i e-J,    provided for in the schedule could never become qualified to acquire it,      The safeguards in the Schedule regarding other matters should also be kept in mind in considering the matter. 8.       The Europeans in the Bechuanaland Protectorate and most of those in Swaziland (there are very few outside the Administration in Basutoland) are definitely in favour of transfer, which would be of great advantage to them economically.      Nothing is worse, from their point of view, than the present uncertainty.9.      In spite of the arguments which can be adduced in favour of transfer it must be admitted that the process of obtaining the acquiescence of the natives, at any rate in Basutoland and the Bechuanaland Protectorate, is likely to be a difficult matter, if it is possible at all.       The nativesare
ft.     f    1***34aare inspired by a strong suspicion of the -principles of Union native policy,,      I understand that native opinion generally in Swaziland may be slightly less hostile,  and that the Paramount Chief there is not unprepared to consider transfer if the conditions attached to it are sufficiently satisfactory0     But. other chiefs in Swaziland do not share this attitude.      On the whole, it seems probable that the process of transfer, if and when it does become practicable, would best be carried through in stages, and that the process may begin with Swaziland, which was formerly a protectorate of the South African Republic, and to which the Union Government have undoubtedly stronger historical claim than to the other two Territories,,10.    The Agreement of 1935 held out the prospect of a solution of the difficulties being reached in the course of time, and (with all due respect to General Hertzog&apos;s view to the contrary) we have in fact done our best to carry out the Agreement.      The chief reason why the policy embodied in it broke down last year is referred to in the draft letter attached (Appendix III)* &apos;   The responsibility lies with him.     Unfortunately just as the main experiment in co-operation with the Union Government (a Scheme by which the Union Government was to contribute on a 50;50 basis towards certain important development works in the Territories) was being launched with a fair prospect of success, he made an extremely inaccurate speech in the Union Parliament which gave everyone, including the natives of the Territories, the impression that there was some secret agreement between him and the United Kingdom Government that transfer of Swaziland would take place within a year or two and that transfer of the other territories would
would, follow shortly.      On receiving representations from me he agreed to ray denying categorically and publicly that there was any such understanding.      But the damage was done, and native suspicions were difficult to allay.11.    The whole process of quiet consideration of the problem by everyone concerned is prejudiced by these periodic outbursts from the over-zealous General.      It seems to me that our policy now must be first to endeavour to restore the confidence of General Hertzog and his colleagues (most of whom are more reasonable on this matter) in the good faith of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom:  secondly to re-establish constructive co-operation; and thirdly to do anything else that wo properly can to help to bring about a situation in which in the words of the Aido-Memoire of 1935,  &quot;if transfer were to become a matter of practical politics,  it could be effected with the full acquiescence of the populations concerned.&quot;12.    The attached draft letter (Appendix III) is an attempt at a first step in such a policy.      If my colleagues approve its general line,  I should like to.have discretion to alter it in form and detail, if that should seem desirable after further enquiry.      I would propose to communicate it first to Sir William Clark, our High.Commissioner in South Africa, for his comments.      It is desirable that it should go to General Hertzog in its final form as soon as possible, and in any case sometime early in September.      In his interview at Bloemfontein he threatened that it might be necessary to move addresses to the King in both Houses of the Union Parliament, in terms of section 151 of the South Africa Act, asking for the transfer of the territories
Territories-to the Union,      Legally such action would, have no effect as it:would rest with Ministers in the United Kingdom to advise His Majesty in the matter, but of course such a situation would be extremely embarrassing and might well lead to serious friction.      The Union Parliament will not, however, meet till January, and I hope that as a result of the suggestions made in the letter to General Hertzog, and discussion arising from them, it will be possible before then to re-establish co-operation in this matter between the two Governments,  so that the Union Government will not think it necessary to proceed to take the action threatened hy their Prime Minister.      We ought to he able to overcome this difficulty satisfactorily.McMo23rd July,  1937.
EXTRACT FROM THE &quot;TIMES&quot; OP 7TH JULY 1937.AFRICAN NATIVE TERRITORIES. TRANSFER&apos; TO UNION. GENERAL HERTZOG ON UNKEPT PROMISE FROM OUR CORRESPONDENTBLOEMFONTEIN, JULY 6.The prime Minister., General Hertzog, to-day gave me a considered statement on the position of the British and Union Governments and the native protectorates.It is clear to me (he said) that in British circles   * the question of the transfer of the native territories to the - Union is being played with in a manner that does not keep adequate count of the right the Union demands that the transfer shall be delayed no longer, and that the Union&apos;s request in this respect must be fulfilled.This request was directed to the British Government by me as far back as 1925, and in 1926, on the occasion of the Imperial Conference, it was discussed by me with the British Minister concerned.      It was then represented to me that the time was not propitious, inter alia, because a general election in Great Britain was imminent.    I gave the assurance that I was unwilling to see the British Government involved in difficulty at the elections because of this question.    I was therefore prepared to adopt a waiting attitude until the elections were over.      The elections came and went; since then three Imperial Conferences have been held and the question has been brought up at-1-
at each by me with the responsible Minister.      Both in 1935 and again now I emphatically pointed to the necessity for a speedy transfer if the ruin of numbers of European inhabitants in some of the territories concerned was to be prevented.A WRITTEN ASSURANCE.In 1935 the then British Minister concerned, with the consent of his colleagues, gave me a written assurance, later made public, in which the prospect was set out that the transfer might possibly occur after a few years, at least so far as one or two of the territories were concerned.      Moreover, I was told at the time that in order to expedite and assure the transfer as much as possible instructions would be given to the British officials entrusted with the administration of the territories to use such influence with the natives under their jurisdiction as would advance the establishment of a disposition towards the Union that would facilitate the achievement of the said purpose.To my sorrow I now learn that no such instructions have been given, and that it will take a long time before the transfer will be possible.     As the reason why the promised instructions were not issued, I am informed that if this had been done the Government would be accused of using officials in the territories for exercising improper compulsion on the natives under their controliI need not enter now (continued General Hertzog) into the objections and the differences of opinion advanced by me against all this.     Let it suffice for me here to focus attention on the serious departure of this latest reply from that of two years ago, and to say that this action of the British Minister -so
so much in conflict with what was projected in 1935 - is due to nothing so much as political considerations in connexion with the ballot-box.      This is sufficiently clear from the reason advanced why the promised instructions were not given to the officials in the territories,,     When it is taken Into consideration, moreover, how much it has become almost a fixed custom in the House of Lords, whenever an Imperial Conference takes place and there is at least a whisper of the transfer of native territories,  to take the opportunity of formally raising the voice of protest against the transfer, then the official concession to political considerations in England can be better understood in South Africa, but not better appreciated.&quot;INDISPUTABLE11 RIGHTIt is obvious that the matter cannot be left at this. The Union&apos;s right to the transfer of the Administrations of the territories is indisputable,      That the time for their transfer to the Union has already expired was conceded two&apos;years ago; that it is therefore the duty of Great Britain to see to it that everything be done to advance the transfer which she undertook under the South Africa Act or to which she thereby agreed,, and that her officials shall be instructed to act in the spirit of her obligations, nobody will deny..In these circumstances it is inconceivable to me to believe that there should be much further delay in the transfer of the territories, or that the Union Government should he compelled to have recourse to the South Africa Act to request the King, by means of a decision of Parliament, to accede to the transfer.The
The consequence8, both to Great Britain and South Africa, that would follow from such a step are so incalculable that for the time being I am not prepared to accept that the reply just given by the British Minister concerned is final.     However disappointing that reply may be, I still remain hopeful that the matter will soon be solved in friendly cooperation.
APPENDIX II.Extract from the Official Report of the House of Commons,Friday, 9th July, 1937.SOUTH AFRICA (HIGH COMMISSION TERRITORIES).Captain Peter Macdonald asked the Secretary of State for Dominion AffairsYvhether he has seen the announcement by General Hertzog regarding the High&quot; Commission territories in South Africa; and whether he has any statement to make on the matter?The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs (Mr. Malcolm MacDonald) :   Yes,   Sir.    I have seen the Press Reports of General Hertzog&apos;s statement.    Clearly, there has been some misunderstanding with regard to this matter.General Hertzog is reported as saying that when he raised the question of transfer of the Territories in 1926, he was told by the&apos;responsible Ministers here that the time was not then propitious inter alia because of the imminence of a General Election in this country. There is no record here to this effect.    Indeed, no such reason could have been given, because no election was pending at that time, and none, in fact, took place until nearly three years later.As regards General Hertzog&apos;s statement that in 1935 he was given a written assurance in which theprospect-1-
4 5 a prospect was set out that transfer would possibly occur after a few years at least so far as one or two of the Territories are concerned, this,  of course, refers to the agreement which was reached between General Hertzog and my predecessor that year and which is embodied in the aide memo ire published as Cmd.4948,    The aide memoire states that&quot;the policy of both Governments for the next few 3^ears should be directed to bringing about a situation in which if transfer were to become a matter of practical politics,  it could he effected with the full acquiescence of the populations concerned&quot;. Yfith this end in view it was proposed that the closest possible co-operation should be established between the Union Government and the Administrations of the Territories.    In July of last year General Hertzog concurred in my informing the House that there was no agreement or understanding that the transfer of the Territories, or any of them, should take place in any specified time, and that he agreed with the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom that it was essential to the success of the policy of co-operation that it should not be hurried, and that until the policy had had a fair trial any predictions as to the period within which it might be expected to succeed in bringing about the situation which the two Governments had in mind when the aide memoire was issued mustnecessarily
necessarily be in the nature of conjecture.I am sorry that General Hertzog should feel that there has been a failure on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom to carry out an undertaking given in 1935 regarding the instructions to be sent to the officials in the Territories for implementing this policy.    Here, also, there must be some misunderstanding, for,  as was stated by my predecessor in the House at the time, the instructions to the High Commissioner in connection with the agreement of that year were shown to General Hertzog before they were sent, and he concurred in their terms.I had two conversations with General Hertzog cn this subject while he was in this country recently, at the second of which Mr. Havenga was also present. General Hertzog pressed the view that the process of transferring the Territories to the Union should begin in the near future.    I explained that the situation described in the aide, memoire had not yet greatly altered. I made it clear that His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom adhered without any qualification to the terms of the agreement which had been reached between him and my predecessor,  and I undertook to consider carefully what further steps were now practicable to implement that policy.    At the conclusion of our talks General Hertzog and I agreed that after his return to South Africa We should communicate further with each other regarding this.His
His Majesty1s Government in the United Kingdom are determined to carry out&apos; loyally the policy which was agreed two years ago? and I share the hope which General Hertzog has expressed that the question may he solved - in the best interests of all the peoples concerned - in friendly co-operation.
APPENDIX III. Draft let tax&apos; to General Hertzog.I welcomed the opportunity whilst you were in London this summer of discussing with you. the position regarding the transfer of the South African High Commission Territories.      To my mind  this   is a question of great importances with regard to which it is desirable, and indeed essential,  that there should he constant contact, understanding and confidence between His Majesty&apos;s Governments in the Union of South Africa and in the United Kingdom.      I was therefore glad of the frank and friendly discussions which we had,  though keenly sorry that you should have felt disappointment at their outcome.You will remember that at the close of our talks, I promised, to think over very carefully the position as it was left hy them, and to communicate with you further after your return to South Africa..     The purpose was to see what further practical action we could devise in consultation together to enable the policy agreed upon in 1935 to he given full effect. -Since you returned to South Africa the question has been further discussed in your and my public statements,  and in the light of these I have included in this letter some account of recent developments regarding the question which will I hope make clear the attitude which His Majesty&apos;s Government In the United Kingdom has adopted towards it.I should like at the outset to say that His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom entirely accept the view expressed.
expressed in your speech in London in May, 1935,  that Section 151 of the South Africa Act, with the Schedule,  has a &quot;meaning and intention. &apos;-&apos;     We fully recognise the significance of the Section, and do not   seek to minimise it.      At the same time the position of the United Kingdom Government is also necessarily governed by the pledges which were given during the passage of the South Africa Bill through the United Kingdom parliament in 1909,  i.e.  that transfer should not take place until the wishes of the natives of the Territories had been most carefully considered,  and that before such transfer Parliament here should also be given the fullest opportunity of expressing its views.For the purposes of this letter,  I do not think it is necessary to go into the past history of this question beyond the agreement which you reached with my predecessor in 1935, which at present governs the situation.In the course of your discussions with him in thatyear, Mr.  J. II. Thomas,  then Secretary of State for DominionAffairs,  told you that the information available to theGovernment here indicated that native opinion in the Territoriesremained strongly opposed to transfer, and that he thereforedid not think that the time was ripe for consulting opinion in the Territories with regard to it.      You and he then agreedto the policy which was set forth by him on behalf of theUnited Kingdom Government in the Aide-Msmoire of May 15th, 1935,in the following words&quot;the policy of both Governments for the next few years should b^ directed to.bringing about a situation in which,  if transfer were to become a matter of practical politics,  it could be effected with the. fullacquiescence
acquiescence of the populations concerned.      With this end in view we feel it important that the closest possible co-operation should be established between the Union Government and the Administrations of the Territories.      We realise,  of coarse,  that some measure of co-operation already exists;    but we feel that there are many directions in which it could be fruitfully extended.      In particular it appears to as to be an essential condition of the success of each a policy that the native population should feel that the Union Government are working in concert with the local Administrations with a real, and generous desire to develop and improve conditions in the Territories.It has sometimes been suggested that the unitedKingdom Govfrnmfint have failed to play their part in implementingthis policy.      I should like to recapitulat--- briefly the steps which the United Kingdom Government have taken to carry it out.Following immediately on his discussion with you Mr,  Thomas sent a letter to Sir William Clark,  the High Commissioner,  informing him of the discussion and proposing the lines of action which heand the local Administrations in the Territories should adoptfor the policy &apos;s achievement.      Before that letter was sent itwas shown to you,  so that there might be an understanding as tothe   general lines which the local Administrations should adopt.Regarding this, Mr. Thomas wrote in the letterI... promised, to press upon you (the&apos; High Commissioner) the desirability of having as comprehensive a scheme of co-operation as possible worked out.      I mentioned that I thought it would be very desirable that you should have a further talk with General Hertzog as soon as possible after his return.      I added that I was sure that the right policy, especially in dealing with the chiefs and. their followers, was to discourage agitation against joining the Union and concentrate on getting everyone, natives and Europeans alike,  to work for the success of such co-opera-tive measures as might be found possible.      It seemed to me that this was the best way of creating the right atmosphere. General Hertaog concurred&apos;.On your return to South Africa,  Sir William Clarkdiscussed the matter with you,  and subsequently conferred both with the Resident Commissioners of the Territories and withrepresentatives
representatives of the Union Government in order to see what co-operative measures were possible.      Certain arrangements were made and carried out regarding the loan of Union experts on problems affecting the Territories,  and other matters.Moreover, when the Union Government generously offered to share the cost of certain important development schemes which we were initiating in the Territories,  the High Commissioner with my approval accepted the offer on a 50:50 basis,  and the Resident Commissioners were instructed to explain this proposal to the inhabitants of the Territories and to seek their co-operation. Despite the initial op&apos;pots.ition of the native authorities,  it seemed likely that this co-operation would be secured, when a debate took place, in June 1936, in the Union Parliament,  in the course of which things were said which made the natives suspect,  quite- erroneously, that attached to the Union5 s financial offer was some condition regarding the transfer of some or all of the Territories within a set period of years.      Though with your concurrence I stated in the House of Commons soon after that th^re was not and had not at any   -time been such an agreement, uneasiness regarding the proposal for financial assistance had, unfortunately, been aroused amongst the natives,  and in those circumstances you concurred in the abandonment for the time being of the proposal.I very much regretted the breakdown of the policy ofco-operation in this very important field.      Such a practicalexample of the Union Government&apos;s readiness to help the popula-tions of the Territories should in time have had a considerable effect in establishing in their minds a more friendly dispositiontowards the Union,    and had the propodals materialised,  theymight well by now have begun to have that effect.     This incident,so- 4 - unfortunately
mISOunfortunately interrupted the work of co-operation   is the  explain-nationwhy the situation in the Territories regarding the question has  altered so little in the last year or so.As regards the other suggestion in Mr.  Thomas&apos;s letter to the High Commissioner,  that agitation against joining the Union should he discouraged,  I am confident that the High Commissioner and Resident Commissioners have acted in this spirit,  as has also the Government here.      I may mention in this connection that on hoth occasions in the past (i.e.   i- 1919 and 1923) when my predecessors have received in London deputati mis from Chiefs in the Territories in regard to transfer steps were taken to impress upon the deputations that in the opinion of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment in the United Kingdom the provisions of the Schedule to the South Africa Act provided adequate safeguards for the interests of the native populations in the event of transfer to the Union,His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom stand by the policy of bringing about a situation in which,  if transfer were to become a matter of practical politics,  it could be effected with the full acquiescence of the populations concerned.   - The question now is what further steps can he taken to give effect to the intention of thel935 Agreement.      Parliament here, who are to have the opportunity of considering transfer before it can take place, would not,  I feel certain,  agree to transfer if after consultation it appeared that native opinion was hostile to the change.I have given the question further careful thought following upon the talks with you and Mr. Havenga, and should like .to put to you the following considerations.        In the first place, can we  do anything more in present circumstances in the way of practical
mpractical co-operation &quot;between the Union Government and the^administrations of the Territories in matters of interest and-&quot;benefit to the inhabitants of the Territories, so that the nativesmay feel that, in the words of the Aide Memoire of 1935,&apos;the Union Government are &quot;working in concert with the localAdministrations with a real and generous desire to develop and improve conditions in the Territories&quot;?     I appreciate^tha t, inview of the circumstances in which financial co-operationconnected with development schemes broke down last year,  it isloubtful -whether further proposals of this kind could usefully be renewedat present.      There are, however, other practical ways inwhich the Union Government may be able to show their goodwill towards andreadiness to help the Territories, and indeed certain measuressuch as the loan of technical officers have already been arranged as a result of the conversations between Sir William Clark and representatives of the Union Government at the end of 1935.      Ishould welcome any further measures of that nature which were practicable.A step which would undoubtedly have the greatest possible favourable influence on opinion in the Territories would be the withdrawal, or relaxation, of the weight and other restric-tions imposed in respect of the entry of cattle from the Territories into the Union.      I referred to this in a conversation which I had with Mr. Havenga shortly before he left England, and recognise your difficulties regarding it..     But if it were at all possible.      v,.:-&apos;&quot;&quot;&quot;,-/ ;&apos;;/&quot;V. - &apos; &apos; for the Union Government to give the matter fresh consideration, py further step in that direction could hardly fail to be regarded py the peoples of the Territories as an act of real goodwill, and p would impress on them the advantages which can be gained fromclose
mclose and friendly relations with the Union authorities.Further I have been considering whether it would he possible to take steps to remove any misapprehensions which may exist in the local populations&apos; minds as to their position in the event of transfer.      If misunderstandings on this point exist,  it is desirable that they should be removed by explanations of the facts so that there should be a  true understanding of the prospects. The question arises,  for instance, whether it would not he useful for an outline of the system of administration set out in the Schedule to the South Africa Act to he made available to the Native Authorities in the Territories in some simple form, with an indica-tion of how the system would be worked;in practice and to what extent,  if any, the form of administration to which the natives are now accustomed would be changed as a result of transfer. I know that the Union Government are willing that the principles set out in the Schedule to the South Africa Act should be maintained, and, as you are aware,  the United Kingdom Government attach great importance to this.      Indeed,  they are pledged not to support any proposal for transfer if it involved the impairment of such safe-guards for native rights and interests as the Schedule was designed to secure.      It would,  I think, he helpful if the Union Government could prepare some document on the&apos; lines suggested above.  Mr.Havenga will remember that in my last talk with him in London regarding the Territories I suggested that  this matter should be looked into.The question also arises whether it would be possible in such a document to make available to the Native authorities in the Territories information as to any economic and other advantages which might be expected to result from transfer.      producers in
in the Territories, Europeans and Natives alike, are largely depen-dant on the Union market, and on the economic side it would clearly be of importance that they should he aware    what would he the position with regard to the marketing of their produce in the Union.      It is provided in the Schedule to the South Africa Act that in the event of transfer no differential duties or imposts on the produce of the Territories should he levied hut, apart from this point,  it would be desirable that the effect of transfer in regard to the present quotas,  levies and restrictions, especially in respect of cattle,  should be clearly indicated.It would no doubt also be desirable to include in the document mention of the point which Union Ministers have already made known to us through Sir William Clark that the Union Government would be prepared in the event of transfer,  to take over the- serving officials in the Territories, including Native officials.If you agree that the preparation of a document or documents on these points would be useful,  I would suggest that your officers might confer with Sir William Clark as to the most suitable form for the document to take. .    The question how best such a document could be made available to the Native Authorities in the Territories would be a matter for further discussion.      So far as I am concerned,  the object would be as explained above,  to secure a full presentation of the facts.I should however mention that there are certain prior points for consideration before it would be possible to settle the terms of any such document.      In the memorandum which Mr.  Thomas handed to General Smuts in July 1933 (which we subsequentlypublished-:8s-&apos;
published here in the Parliamentary Paper 4-948 as an Appendix to the Aide.-Memoire of May, 1935) it was pointed out that since the South Africa Act was passed the Constitutional position   had been affected hy the passage of the Statute of Westminster and that there were in particular two sections in the Schedule which required special consideration,  i.e. Section 20, which states that the King may disallovf any law made hy the Governor-General in Council hy Proclamation for any territory;  and Section 25, which provides that all Bills to amend or alter the provisions of the Schedule shall he reserved for the signification of His Majesty&apos;s pleasure.      then the South Africa Act was passed His Majesty would have been advised on such matters after transfer of the Territories by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom. It would be desirable that we should discuss together what form of alternative security for the populations of the Territories on these points could take the place of these provisions.I should be glad to receive your observations on the suggestions put forward In this letter, and if you have any other suggestions to make I shall, of course, he very ready to consider them.      In the meantime I earnestly hope that public controversy in this matter can as far as possible be avoided, for this only tends to increase the difficulties.&apos; I would suggest that theterms of any public announcement.as to future policy in regard to this question which it may be possible to make after the present communication between us has been concluded, should he agreed between us.      I can assure you that the wish of the United Kingdom Government is to continue to work in close co-operation with you in this matter, in the hope that it may be settled by friendly agreement in the best interests of all the peoples concerned.

Aide-memoire regarding the Jjfigh Commission Territories in South Africa, handed to the Pifime Minister of the Union of South Africa by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs on 15th May,, 19.35We are pledged to Parliament here that the transfer of the High Commission Territories should not take place :-: (a) until the inhabitants, Native as well as European, have been consulted, and(b) until Parliament has been given an opportunity of expressing its views.These pledges were given during the passage, through Parliament of the South Africa Bill, and have been several times, repeated since. Their nature is set out in some, detail in a memorandum handed to General Smuts in July, 1933.   (See Appendix.)2. It has been explained in the previous exchange of letters with General Hertzog that we do not regard the time as ripe for con-suiting the inhabitants under the first of the above-mentioned pledges. All our information goes to show that at present native opinion in the Territories is very strongly opposed to transfer. In these circumstances it appears to us that the results of such consultation would be embarrassing and undesirable from every point of view. We believe that the Union Government, in the words used by General Hertzog in March, 1925, would not wish to incorporate the Territories in the Union unless the inhabitants of the Territories, Native as well as European, &quot; are prepared and desire to come in &quot;.3. We do not wish to suggest that the principles underlying Section 151 of the South Africa Act have been affected except in so far as the establishment of Southern Rhodesia as a self-governing Colony has a, bearing on the future of at any rate part of the Bechuanaland Protectorate. It.-will be appreciated, however, that the provisions of the Schedule to the Act would have to be re-examined in the light of the general constitutional developments since the Act was passed. The provisions requiring special con-sideration in this connection were mentioned in the memorandum handed to General Smuts, which is referred to above.4. The conclusion which we draw from the above considerations is that the policy of both Governments for the next few years sb-ould be directed.to.bringing about., a situation,in which, if transfer were to become a matter of practical politics, it could be effected with, the, full acquiescence of the populations concerned,-. &quot;With this end in view we feel it important that the closest possible co-operation should be established, between the Union Government and the Administrations of the Territories. We realize, of course, that some measure of co-operation already exists; but we feel that there are
many directions in which it could be fruitfully extended. In par-ticular it appears, to us to be an essential condition of the&apos; success of such a policy that the native population should feel that the Union Government are working in concert with the local Adminis-trations with a real and generous desire to develop and improve conditions in the Territories.5. We would very gladly consider sympathetically /any pro-posals which the Union Government may feel able to make as to further practical steps which could be taken for promoting co-operation on these lines with the Administrations of the three Territories.May, 1935.APPENDIX.Memorandum handed to General Smuts by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs on 21st July, 1933.In considering any suggestion for transfer of any of the South African High Commission Territories to the Union, account must be taken of the following considerations:  (i) Pledges given by or on. behalf of successive Secretaries of State to-(a) Parliament;(b) the inhabitants of the Territories.(ii) The conditions prescribed in the Schedule to the South Africa Act, 1909.(iii) The wishes of the inhabitants.I. Pledges given by His Majesty&apos;&apos;s &quot;Government in the United Kingdom.When the South Africa Bill was before the House of Commons the Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies stated on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government that &quot; The House may rest assured-and I have the full authority of the Government and the Prime Minister for saying so that it will have the fullest opportunity of considering the matter before the transfer of, the Protectorates.&quot;At a later stage of the debate he stated:  &quot; The wishes of the natives in these Territories will be most carefully considered before any transfer takes place.&quot;At the same time the former assurance was repeated with an additional statement, that the House&quot; will have an opportunity of discussing, and, if they wish, of dis-approving of the action of the Government.&quot; -
In November, 1919, the following question was asked in the House of Commons:. &quot; Whether His Majesty&apos;s Government are considering any alteration in the status of the Protectorates of Swaziland, Bechuanaland, and Basutoland; whether the inhabitants will be consulted before any change in the status does take place, and whether the House of Commons will have an opportunity of debating the matter before any action is taken.&quot;The answer of the Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies was - as follows :  -&quot;The answer to the first part of the question is in the negative, and to the second and third parts in the affirmative.&quot;In February, 1925, the following question was asked in the House of Commons:  &quot; Whether the Secretary of State for the Colonies can give an assurance, that no steps will be taken to concur in any way with the incorporation of Bechuanaland or Basutoland or Swaziland in the Union of South Africa before an opportunity has been given to this House to record its opinion on this matter of our responsibility for and to the native races.&quot;To which the Secretary of State made the following reply :  &quot; In accordance with the pledges given when the South Africa Bill was before Parliament, the House will have the fullest opportunity of discussing, and, if they wish, of disapproving any proposed transfer of these Territories to the Union.&quot;In the course of a statement in February, 1925, in the House of Lords, Lord Onslow stated on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government that if at any time His Majesty&apos;s Government should be asked to come to any decision in regard to any such transfer,&quot; they will not make any decision until the native population and the white population have had full opportunity of expressing their views, and any views they may express, and any representations which either the native population or the white population may make to His Majesty&apos;s Government will receive the most careful consideration before the Government come to any final decision in regard to the matter.&quot;Reference may also be made in this connection to the following statement made by General Hertzog in the Union Parliament on the 25th March, 1925:-&quot; Our position has always been as a party, that we are not prepared to incorporate in the Union any Territory unless the inhabitants of the Territory are prepared to come in.&quot;II. The South Africa Act, 1909.Section 151 of the Act provides that the King, with the advice of the Privy Council, may on addresses from the Houses of Parliament of the Union, transfer to the Union the government of any of the territories, subject to the terms and conditions embodied in the Schedule.The terms of the Schedule were drawn up by the South Africa National Convention and were accepted by that body and by the Parliament of the United Kingdom as embodying certain principles and safeguards to native rights long recognized as essential.Three important features which may:be noted are:  (a) The provisions prescribing that no part of the native reserves may be alienated from the native tribes inhabiting the Territories (Section 14);
(6) The composition of the Commission charged with the duty of advising the Prime Minister iii the administration of the Territories (Section 3);(c) The provisions prohibiting the levying of any differential duties or imposts upon the produce of the Territories (Section 17).The importance of the Schedule as a guarantee that the existing rights of the natives would not be prejudiced in the event of transfer was ex-plained to the Swazi deputation in 1923 by the then Secretary of State. On this occasion the Secretary of State said: &quot;I need hardly say that His Majesty&apos;s Government would not support in the House of Commons or elsewhere any proposal for transfer if it involved the impairment of such safeguards for native rights and interests as the Schedule to the South Africa Act was designed to secure.&quot;Since the South Africa Act was passed the constitutional position has been affected by the passage of the Statute of Westminster. In view of this Statute the Schedule to the South Africa Act can no longer be regarded as affording in itself a legal safeguard, though it is clear from what is stated above that transfer oould only be made subject to agreement that the general scheme of the schedule would be maintained.There are two provisions in the Schedule which require special considera-tion in this connection; viz., (i) Section 20, which states that the King may disallow any law made by the Governor-General in Council by Proclama-tion for any territory, (ii) Section 25, providing that all Bills to amend or alter the provisions of the Schedule shall be reserved for the signification of His Majesty&apos;s pleasure.Before any question of transfer could be considered it would be necessary to ascertain:  (a) What the Union Government would propose to substitute for the provision relating to the power of disallowance. (This, at the time when the South Africa Act was passed, meant disallowance on the advice of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom.)   And(b) What alternative form of security could be provided in place of the provision as regards reservation. (At the time of the South Africa Act His Majesty would have been advised as to the Bills in question by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom.)III. The Wishes of the Inhabitants.In accordance with the pledges referred to above it would be essential to give both the native population and the white population of the Territory or Territories concerned full opportunity of expressing their views with regard to any proposal for transfer, and the question when and how this could be done would require very careful consideration. In this connection account would have to be taken of the fact that the native policy in the Union is still the subject of discussion and will, it is understood, form the subject of future legislation. The natives of the Territories would naturally require to know how their interests were likely to be affected by any developments of native policy in the Union.
