PALESTINE.STATEMENT OP POLICY BY HIS MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT IN THE UNITED KINGDOM.His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom, by direction of. His Majesty, have considered the&apos; unanimous Report of the Palestine Royal Commission. They find themselves in general agreement with the arguments and conclusions of the Commission.2. As is fully recognised by the Commissioners in their historical survey, His Majesty&apos;s Government arid their predecessors, since the obligations of the Mandate were accepted, have taken the view, which the tenor of the Mandate itself implies, that their obligations to Jews and Arabs respectively were not incompatible, on the assumption that in the process of time the. two races would so adjust their national aspirations as to render possible the establishment of a single commonwealth under a unitary government.8. In spite of many discouraging experiences during the past seventeen years. His Majesty&apos;s Government have based their policy on this expectation, and have taken every opportunity of encouraging co-operation between Arabs and Jews. In the light of experience and of the arguments adduced by the Commission they are driven to the conclusion that there is an irreconcilable conflict between the aspirations of Jews and Arabs in Palestine, that these aspirations cannot be satisfied under the terms of the present Mandate, and that a scheme of partition on the general lines recommended by the Commission represents the best and most hopeful solution of the deadlock.4. His Majesty&apos;s Government accordingly propose to take such steps as are necessary and appropriate, having regard to their existing treaty obligations under the Covenant of the League of Nations and other international instruments, to obtain freedom to give effect to a scheme of partition, to which they earnestly hope that it may be possible to secure an effective measure of consent on the part of the communities concerned.5. Pending the establishment of such a scheme, His Majesty&apos;s Government have no intention of surrendering their responsibility for peace, order and good government throughout Palestine. They are in general agreement with the Commission^ recommendations in the matter of public security. If serious disorders should again break out, of such a nature as to require military intervention, the High Commissioner will delegate powers in respect of the whole country, under the Palestine (Defence) Orders-in-Council to the General Officer Commanding the military forces.
6. In the immediate future, while the form or a scheme of partition is being worked out, His Majesty&apos;s Government propose that, as an interim measure, steps should be taken to prohibit any land transactions which might prejudice such a scheme. Further, since the period of the current labour schedule expires at the end of July and some provision must be made for the ensuing period, they;propose that a total Jewish immigration in all categories of 8,000 persons shall be permitted for the eight months&apos; period August 1937 tp March 1938, provided that the economic absorptive capacity of.the country is not exceeded. - , ,.7.   His Majesty&apos;s Government propose to advise His Majesty ; accordingly, and to cause to be prepared in due course estimates, of the sums which Parliament will be asked to vote in connection with certain of the proposals  arising out of the  Commission^ recommendations.8. In supporting a solution of the Palestine problem by means of partition, His Majesty&apos;s Government are much impressed by the advantages which it offers both to the Arabs and the Jews. The Arabs would obtain their national independence, and thus be enabled to co-operate on an equal footing with the Arabs of neighbouring countries in the cause of Arab unity and progress. They would be finally delivered from all fear of Jewish domination, and from the anxiety which they have expressed lest their Holy Places should ever come under Jewish control. The Arab State would receive financial assistance on a substantial scale both from His Majesty&apos;s Government and from the Jewish State. On the other hand, partition would secure the establishment of the Jewish National Home and relieve, it from any possibility of its being subjected in the future to, Arab rale. It would convert the Jewish National Home into a Jewish State with full control over immigration. Its nationals would acquire a status similar to that enjoyed by the nationals of other countries. The Jews would at last cease to live a &quot; minority life,&quot; and the primary objective of Zionism would thus be attained. Under the proposed Treaties the rights of minorities in both States would be strictly guaranteed. Above all, fear and suspicion would be replaced by a sense of confidence and security, and both peoples would obtain, in the words of the Commission, &quot; the inestimable boon of peace.&quot;Wt.- 2 7/37 F.O.P. 15505 Gp. 340
