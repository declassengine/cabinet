Printed for the Cabinet: July 1937.-SECRET- Copy No.CP. 200 (37).COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.PALESTINE: ROYAL COMMISSION REPORT.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.IN continuation of CP. 193 (37) I circulate herewith, for the information of the Cabinet, extracts from a further letter from the High Commissioner for Palestine to the Permanent Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies, on the situation in Palestine and Trans-Jordan, following the publication of the Report of the Palestine Royal Commission.(Initialled) W. O. G.Colonial Office, Downing Street, July 23, 1937.ANNEXURE.Extracts from a Letter from Sir A rthur Wauchope to Sir Cosmo Parkinson, &apos;dated July 19, 1937.YOU will have seen from my cable of to-day&apos;s date how near we were to effecting the arrest. Dill was in my house all the Saturday afternoon, and we both thought our plans had all been kept secret and success assured. It is tragic that when an officer is told to reconnoitre and guard a house by his Chief (Rice), he should refrain for three hours to discover the back door the door we now know Mufti used earlier in the afternoon. Both, for Palestine and also for use in the coming debate the arrest on Saturday was so important and it was so extraordinarily near.One great advantage of Mufti&apos;s arrest now will be to prevent his making further appeals and preventing his giving any support to those who may wish for disturbances. The Mufti is now essentially a political protagonist working against Government policy, and every day&apos;s delay in arresting him is a danger to security in Palestine.&quot;7v *7T *7V&quot; *7V *rV*The country remains quiet, and I find Shertok as always helpful. He does not think the majority at their Congress will definitely oppose Partition, but will say they must fight for this and that and the other.Ben Gurion and Ussishkin have openly declared they are against Partition. I told Shertok that I thought the rumours that British officials were against Partition were quite untrue my own position, of course, is as stated in my Broadcast, and this has been in part re-stated in a communique three days ago.It is true that Arabs and Jews are now considering the drawbacks of the scheme of the Royal Commission more than the advantages, but I think later on the advantages of Partition may become more evident to many.[15657]
At present, I judge the Christians of Galilee and, Archbishop Haj jar to be united opponents to all form of Partition that gives Galilee to the Jews the MuftiV influence is of course against Partition, but there are, for the moment, large numbers against it quite apart from Mufti, as was shown by the instan-taneous results of Hikmet Suliman&apos;s statement.The National Defence Party are now very angry with Abdullah for declaring himself in favour of Partition; Abdullah and Amir Talal became reconciled again last week; Kirkbride told me to-day he thinks that Trans-Jordan is quiet and will remain quiet, though handing over Acre to Jews is subject of much talk.Jf. .AA. Ji- Ji.-7(* -7S* -7V&quot; -7T VV -7\-An Arab official who has always been much agin the Mufti, told me to-day that Arabs are daily hardening against Partition I think he meant rather the scheme as outlined by the Royal Commission chiefly for the following reasons : I. The surrender of Acre and other sacred places to the Jews. II. The surrender of Galilee and Acre district to the Jews.    It would take, they argue, fifty years for the Jews to buy up all this Arab land, why should they surrender it now.   They all fear once a Jewish State is estab-lished, Arab land would be acquired at a very small price.III. The creation of an Arab State would mean a poverty-stricken State with no orange or rich lands for the people, and little revenue for the State.IV. General dislike of anyone so unreliable as Abdullah being King, and certainty of corruption under his and probably any Arab rule.   These[\ opinions, he said, were sincerely held quite apart from any bad advice Mufti might propagate, though my friend admitted Hikmet Suliman&apos;s unexpected pronouncement had a deplorable effect. The arrest of Mufti will be a good counter-stroke.I put up some counter arguments in favour of Partition, but the difficulties to get assent, to the boundaries of the Royal Commission^ scheme are going to be real. Time will help, when the advantages as well as the drawbacks of Partition are realised.&quot; m. J . m. J*. m.&quot;7V* &apos;A&quot; TV&quot; -7V&quot; &quot;R* &quot;7k*I am extremely sorry to say the Prudential have now refused to take up the Tel Aviv million loan. The Acting Treasurer will try and assist Tel Aviv to raise a smaller loan, in addition to their  100,000 loan for school buildings.
