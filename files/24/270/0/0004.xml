THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOYERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   June 1937.SECRET. Copy No.CP. 159 (37).CABINET.AGRICULTURAL BILL.Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.THE Secretary of State for Scotland, in his memorandum No. CP. 157 (37), suggests that a small Cabinet Committee should be set up to consider a question arising out of the proposals for increasing the productivity of the soil put forward in my memorandum No. CP. 117 (37), which was considered and approved by the Cabinet at their meeting on the 6th May (Cab. 21 (37), Conclusion 1 (a)), and announced on the 27th May in terms which were also approved by the Cabinet (the 26th May, Cab. 22 (37), Conclusion 5 (6)). The question is whether the centralised veterinary service, which it is agreed will be necessary for the eradication of animal diseases, should be one service for the whole of Great Britain, or two services, one for England and Wales and one for Scotland.2. The Secretary of State for Scotland feels that, since he did not draw attention to this question when the proposals were before the Cabinet on the 6th and 26th May, the issue is still open, and in these circumstances I am, of course, willing to concur in his proposal that the matter should be referred to a special Cabinet Committee. I set out below the considerations which I feel entirely justify my view that the centralised veterinary service should be in respect of the whole of Great Britain.3. The approach to the question should, I suggest, be to consider, first, which of the two systems a Great Britain service, or separate English and Scottish services--is best suited to the nature of the problem; then, if the adoption of the course which appears desirable on general grounds seems likely to lead to difficulties, to see whether these difficulties are, in fact, insuperable.4. The whole basis of the policy which has recently been formulated and announced after exhaustive inter-departmental consideration, is the development of agricultural productivity with special reference to defence considerations. It is a policy framed on the broadest possible national lines, and unless there are overwhelming reasons to the contrary, its administration should also, I feel, be on national lines.5. These considerations, in my view, have special force in matters relating to diseases of animals, and it is important, I suggest, to consider the question of the best method of administration as an animal health problem and not as a public health problem. I would here point out that, as regards public health, all existing functions and duties in relation to milk from the public health aspect will remain with the public health authorities. The administration throughout Great Britain of measures against animal diseases has been, with one exception, to which I will refer later, the responsibility of my Department since the middle of last century. My Department is at present responsible for administering, inter alia, foot-and-mouth disease, cattle plague, anthrax, sheep pox, sheep scab, swine fever, rabies, glanders and tuberculosis (under the Tuberculosis Order of 1925). It should be noted that even in the case of Tuberculosis (which the Secretary of State rather[15401]
stresses in his memorandum in relation to the purity of the milk supply), if the main consideration is the eradication of disease in the animal, the administration is entrusted to the Minister of Agriculture. Recently we have started to tackle poultry diseases, and Fowl Pest is now a scheduled disease under the Diseases of Animals Acts, by an Order made in December 1936, the responsibility for administration again being entrusted to my Department for the whole of Great Britain. Infectious diseases in animals recognise no political boundaries, and unity of control is essential to prompt and effective action. The Secretary of State, while he suggests that there is a growing feeling in Scotland that the administration of all the disease work under the Diseases of Animals Acts should be undertaken by the Scottish Department of Agriculture, does not himself put forward that proposal, but contends that the new services should be separately administered on the grounds that they are concerned with diseases which are essentially different from epidemic, contagious diseases of animals, such as foot-and-mouth disease. There is, in my view, no essential difference between the prob-lems involved in the control and gradual eradication of a disease like sheep scab (which is, and always has been, dealt with by my Department), and those which will have to be tackled in the campaign for the eradication of bovine tuberculosis. The outstanding feature of these campaigns is the delimitation of areas and the control of the movement of animals within, into and out of such areas. Unless there is unified control and complete uniformity of policy and procedure, difficulties and friction between the two administrations are, in my view, bound to arise, and the efficiency of the service will be impaired.6. The Secretary of State quotes as a precedent for dual control the Tuberculosis (Attested Herds) Schemes under Section 9 of the Milk Act, 1934. But the object of this measure was to secure so far as practicable &quot;that the milk supplied for human consumption in England or in Scotland, as the case may be, is pure and free from the infection of any disease.&quot; The object of the new animal disease eradication policy is the improvement of animal health and the proposals are, both from the point of view of policy and administration, a development of the activities under the Diseases of Animals Acts, with their emphasis on control of movement of animals. The Tuberculosis (Attested Herds) Schemes were designed to deal with individual herds and not areas. The Secretary of State seems to base a large part of his argument on tuberculosis, possibly because that disease will be among the first to be dealt with in the new campaign. But I would point out that our proposals are essentially long term and comprehensive in character, and there are many other diseases which await attack, such as contagious abortion.7. I would strongly urge, therefore, that a disease eradication policy, which is intended to be national in scope, demands unified national administrative responsibility and control without regard to political boundaries. If, as is the case, this is regarded as an essential principle in the United States and Canada, with their vast areas, and their special constitutional difficulties as regards the relationship between Federal and State activities, it should not be impossible of achievement in our small island.8. There has just been published a Report presented to and unanimously adopted by the Council of the National Veterinary Medical Association at a meeting held at the Royal (Dick) Veterinary College, Edinburgh, on the 8th June, 1937. The Council of the Association appointed in 1935 a Committee of Investigation to consider the organisation of the veterinary profession for the control of animal diseases. The Committee has presented a detailed and unanimous Report which strongly advocates a single State Service to deal with animal diseases in Great Britain. The view that &quot; disease knows no geographical boundaries,, and to be controlled, let alone eradicated, must be attacked on a national scale in a consistent and co-ordinated manner &quot; was also strongly urged hy Sir Merrik Burrell, the present Chairman of the Agricultural Committee of the County Councils Association, in an important reservation to the Report of the Gowland Hopkins Committee, whose conclusions are quoted by the Secretary of State for Scotland.-9. The Secretary of State&apos;s memorandum is mainly concerned with difficulties which in his view are likely to arise in co-ordinating the activities of a State veterinary service dealing with animal diseases under the control of
the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, with those which will continue to be exercised by Scottish local authorities in relation to public health. Friendly and effective co-operation between Ministry of Agriculture officials and Scottish local authorities has been a feature for years past of the administration of the Diseases of Animals Acts. Close co-ordination with public health activities will be necessary both in Scotland and in England, and I find it difficult to see why the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries should be unable to co-operate as closely with his colleague the Minister of Health for Scotland as with his colleague the Minister of Health for England and Wales. The English Ministry of Health, it should be noted, have been consulted and have expressed the view that my proposal, in so far as the relationship between State and local authority services in concerned, is on the right lines.10. There would, of course, be no question of lowering the standards already established in Scotland in connection with the Attested Herds Scheme, when it became part of the larger programme now contemplated.11. There remains the question of Scottish political susceptibilities. This, I suggest, is largely a matter of presentation. It seems a curious position to propose to entrust one part of an eradication policy to one Department, and to leave all other parts of the policy with another Department. A Great Britain veterinary service for the eradication of animal diseases is, in my view, a natural and completely justifiable extension of the present system, and one that will unquestionably subserve the truest interests of agriculture in both countries.(Signed) W. S. M.Ministry of A griculture and Fisheries, June 14, 1937.
