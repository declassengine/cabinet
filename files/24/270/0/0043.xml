CONFIDENTIAL. A.C.  383.BOARD OF TRADE ADVISORY COUNCIL. STATE OF TRADE - JUNE 1957.Summary of reports submitted by members of the Board of Trad Advisory Council (supplemented in some cases with statistical information from other sources).OVERSEAS TRADE.    Imports in June at  88.1 m. were  20.5. m. more than in June, 1936.      Over 60 per cent, of the rise was in food and raw materials.      Of the increase of  8.0 m. in manufactured goods,  2.9 m. related to non-ferrous metals and manufactures,  2.1 m. to oils, fats and resins and over  -g- m. each to machinery and to iron and steel manufactures.     Exports of United Kingdom products.,  4404 m., were  12.3 m. more and re-exports,  7.1 m., were  2.1 m. more than in June, 1936cEMPLOYMENT.    The total number of unemployed persons on the registers at 21st June - 1,356,598 - was 94,732 less than at24th May;    the reductions in the various divisions were:-London 0 .........    10,020        North Western ... 19,894South Eastern ..    10,054        Northern.0.....0.    7,767South Western ..    10,780 Scotland ........ 17,073Midlands ..0 ....      5,969 Wales ........... 12,056North Eastern ..      1,119The estimated number of insured workers aged 16-64 in employment (excluding agricultural workers) was 11,517,000 -130,000 more than in May and 584,000 more than in June 1936. The increase as compared with May extended to most industries; but there was an increase in the numbers temporarily stopped in the coal mining industry (mainly owing to the Annual Demonstration of the Yorkshire Mine Workers Association falling on the day the count was taken) and some decline in the tailoring industry.
RAILWAY TRAFFIC.    In the four weeks ended 27th June, railway traffic receipts increased hy  953,000 (8.03%) as compared with the corresponding period of 1936.    Passenger traffic increased hy 2.38%, merchandise, minerals and livestock hy 10.75?o and coal,  coke and patent fuel hy 18.72^.   (This comparison is affected hy the incidence of holidays.    In 1937, Whit Monday fell on 17th May hut in 1936 on 1st June).BANKING:   Money remained comfortable throughout the month and discount rates although firmer were low compared with a yea ago.    The Treasury Bill rate fluctuated between 11/5,41 and 15/0.39.    The gold market was nervous early in June owing to rumours that the United States contemplated lowering their buying price.    Official quarters bought the bulk of the large quantities of gold on offer and the price fluctuated only between 140/3g- and 140/9..    The announcement of His Majesty&apos;s Governments intention to increase the exchange equalisation fund die? much to restore confidence.The increasing weakness of the franc (the 3-months&apos; forward rate went to 10^: francs discount although the spot rate was supported officially at 111)    culminated at the end of June in the closing of the Bourse and the suspension of dealings in francs in London.    The dollar fluctuated between 4.92g- and 4.95*FINANCIAL CONDITIONS ABROAD.    In France the financial situation rapidly deteriorated towards the end of June.    Export of capital and gold reached a very high level.    The Bourse closed on the 29th and 30th June and on re-opening sterling was quoted up to 129 (against llOg- at the close).    Stock markets have been firmer since the devaluation.  &apos; New taxes have been decreed.    In Belgium the Treasury position remained
472 &apos; isatisfactory and investment funds.were plentiful.    The expectation of severe competition from Prance following the devaluation was reflected temporarily in a discount on the forward Belga.    In Holland the inward movement of gold continued and restrictions on gold exports were entirely removed.    In Switzerland no embarrassment to the finances seemed, likely to result from the French devaluation.    The. United States continued to receive gold including large shipments from Japan;    concern was felt for the future of the Yen.SHIPPING.    The freight sitiiation showed, little change. The recent weakness in River Plate business is regarded as temporary.    The Chamber of Shipping index number of freights (1913 = 100) was 145.09 as compared with 154.06 in May and 87,86 in June, 1936.    At the 1st July 61,000 net tons of shipping were laid up in Great Britain and Ireland as compared with 90,000 at the 1st April and 502,000 at the 1st July, 1936.SHIPBUILDING.    Shipbuilding and ship repairing activity was well maintained at most ports;    hut delays&apos; in delivery and higher cost of materials are reported, as retarding factors.    The amount of tonnage under construction in : Great Britain and Ireland at 30th June was 1,200,000 tons gross (the highest quarterly total since June, 1930) as against 1,014,000 at 31st March, and. 849,000 a year ago.    Orders are not, however, keeping pace with launches, some ship owners waiting to see whether the price and delivery situations will ease.COAL.    The rate of improvement of earlier months was not fully maintained and the upward movement in prices was arrested.    Output for the four weeks ended 19th June (19.67 m. tons) was 3.49 m.  tons more than in the corresponding
period a year before (which, however, included the Whitsun holiday).   Exports in June amounted to 3.48 m. tons as compared with 2.57 m. tons a year before.   Most markets \took more, the main increases being to France, Italy andrEgypt.    Prospects in inland trade continue favourable but in export trade are uncertain.IRON AND STEEL.&apos;  Demand for all classes of material remained very strong.    Pour more furnaces were in blast than in May.    Pig-iron output (699,300 tons) was 8%% more than inJune 1936;    crude steel production (1,106,000 tons) was 14^%. &apos;    ... -more;    exports of iron and steel (235,500 tons) were 34.6^ more and imports (particularly of pig-iron) were also far greater.    Additional pig-iron arid steel plant (with capacities of -g-m. and ^m. tons p.a. respectively) will be ready for operation later this year but whether it can be used fully will depend on the raw material situation.    Arrangements have been made to secure further supplies of foreign pig-iron and of scrap from foreign and home sources.   A lull (probably temporary) in demand for steel abroad should enable foreign producers to take advantage of the United Kingdom duty reductions.All districts were very busy.    In Scotland, some steel plant remained idle owing to lack of raw materials but the position of re-rollers improved somewhat.    In Sheffield and Lincolnshire, despite some anxiety about raw material supnlies, most works operated without interference with production. Repair work may retard production in the next month or so.&apos;   ENGINEERING.   Apart from a slight slackening in new business in some directions, the steady progress of the industrjf was maintained.    The improved tone in export trade continued. Exports of machinery amounted to  4.2 m. as compared with  3.0   m. in June, 1936.    Imports ( 2.1 m.) were over  ^ m. more mainly because of increased imports of machine tools.
MO TOR &apos; INDU ST RY.    The number of motor vehicles newly registered in May was 37,452 - 3,507 less than a year before; the decrease in private cars was 3,361.      The production of private cars in April was 36,309 (12.3% more than a year before) and of commercial vehicles 10,059 (21.1% more). Exports of new private cars and chassis in June amounted to 6,566 and of new commercial vehicles and chassis to 1,820 -35.6% and 30.2% respectively more than in June,  1935.    1,510 complete new private cars were imported as compared with 554 a year ago.  .ELLCTRICAL INDUSTRY.    Activity was maintained.      The index for heavy engineering orders was at about the same level as for May and considerably higher than for June,  1935.      Exports of electrical apparatus and machinery ( 1.49m.) were 41% greater than a year before.      Electricity generated was 18% more.NON-FERROUS METALS.    Prices of non-ferrous metals relapsed sharply in the middle of June hut quickly recovered and remained fairly steady until the end of the month.      Trade buying in this country improved moderately and demand in certain overseas markets was better.     A further improvement, with firm markets, seems likely in the near future.CHEMICALS.    Home sales of alkalis showed a considerable increase, and export sales   a  slight increase, as compared with May.      Deliveries of chlorine products and sales of nitrogen products were maintained.      Home sales of dyestuffs showed small increases compared with May;    overseas sales were rather higher than in June,  1935.      Home sales of sulphate of ammonia for the current season are slightly higher than last season;    exports are considerablj7- larger, due to increased sales in Empire markets and China.      Export trade in fine chemicals continued to make progress.
COTTON,..     Activity revived after the holiday slackness in May.     New orders were fewer, hut the industry is likely to &quot;oe busy for some time on existing contracts.      The daily yarn output index (1935 = 100) rose from 109 in May to 113 in June.      The spinning section operated at about 84% of capacity as compared with 7Sc/o in May and 73^ in June 1936a Raw cotton prices continued to fall, but yarn prices were well maintained.     Yarn exports at 14.3 m.    lbs. were rather more than in May (a shorter working month) and 2 m. lbs.more than in June 193S.     Exports of piece goods at 155 m.  sq.. yds. were 7 rae sq.. yds. less than in May, but 25 m. sq. yds. more than in June 1936,    Compared with May, the chief decrease was to India but British West Africa, Venezuela and the Netherlands also took considerably less;    there v/ere substantial increases to Egypt, Argentina and.Australia.WOOL.    There was some improvement in general activity compared with May.     Raw wool prices weakened slightly.-Exports of tissues were materially greater, but of tops and yarns slightly less, then in May;     exports of each group were greater than a year before.Although the industry is still not fully employed, general activity this year has been greater than a year ago; there is no apparent reason to- anticipate any considerable early decline.GII.K AND ,ARTIFICIAL SILKRavgn.    The volume of business from Lancashire and Yorkshire was well maintained.     Business in crepe yarns continued to improve.     The seasonal quietness in the staple fibre trade has been less narked than in previous years.    The piece goods trade was moderately active but buyers v/ere unwilling to place forward contracts.     Exports of yarns and
all-rayon fabrics showed very large increases over June, 1956 and exports of rayon mixtures were also larger.Silk.     The printed fabric trade continued to improve.HIDES AMD&apos; LEATHER.       Hide markets showed a declining tendency during the early part of June but later recovered somewhat.    In the leather industry the early summer quietness has been accentuated this year by the general -uncertainty regarding raw material prices.   The outlook is now more favourable.-BUILDING.   Returns received by the Ministry of Labour from 142 local authorities showed that the estimated cost of buildings for which plans were approved was  8.6 m.- - 13% less than the figure for June, 1936.     There was an increase of 50% for factories but decreases of lSi-% for dwelling houses and 11% for all other buildings and alterations to existing buildings.POTTERY.     The general level of employment in May was substantially higher than a year before.   Demand slackened in the general earthenware and china sections, due partly to the completion of Coronation orders.   The glazed tiles section continued active.     Home sales of sanitary ware of earthenware fell heavily but demand for sanitary ware of fireclay continued brisk.RETAIL TRADE&apos;-   The money value of average daily retail sales in May was 1302% higher than in May 1936;    this increase was regarded as satisfactory even when allowance was made for Coronation trading and the earlier date of Whitsun. Sales of food and perishables rose by 20% and of other merchandise by 7,3%.     Preliminary returns for June indicate satisfactory increases over June 1936.CO-OPERATIVE TRADE (SCOTLAND) - Drapery trade was, on the whole,&apos; rather slow due partly to large, deliveries having been taken early in the year in anticipation of increased
prices and partly to inclement weather.     Trade in the furniture&quot;and furnishing departments was very good.AUSTRALIAN TRADE.,     2,839,000 bales of wool were received into store from 1st July, 1935, to 31st May as compared with 2,766,000 a year before, the quantity sold or shipped being 2,644,000 and 2,619,000 respectively.     Wheat and flour shipments from 1st December, 1936, to 30th June were equivalent to 71.5 rn. bushels of wheat as compared with 67.8 m. a year before.     Butter shipments from 1st July, 1936, to 30th June were 79,000 tons as compared with 94,000 tons a year before. Imports of merchandise during May amounted to  6.76 m. as compared with  6.86 m. in May, 1936.SOUTH AFRICAN TRADE. The shrinkage in stock exchange values, due to the gold price uncertainty, continued in May and it appeared thatj in the absence of an early substantial improvement the break in confidence might have severe repercussions.Imports in April v/ere 15*6% greater than in April, 1936. Exports (excluding gold) were 79,5% more, due mainly to greatly increased wool shipments.    Gold exports were 7,1^ less but the tonnage of ore crushed,was 9% greater.      Maize prices remained weak and the wool market was erratic with a weak tendency.SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE.      Higher prices of primary products have been reflected in sharp increases in imports, but the United Kingdom share of South American markets is not in all cases being maintained.    The latest returns from Argentina and Brazil indicate some improvement, but in Uruguay and Chile, imports from U.S.A. are expanding at a greater rate than those from the United Kingdom.      In Brazil, the difficulty of obtaining deliveries from abroad is accelerating the development of local industries.Argentina.,   Total imports for January-May 1937 v/ere 19% more in value than a year before;    the United Kingdom
share increased hy only 7.8% despite the spectacular improvement during May.    Total exports were about double. The &quot;free&quot; peso sterling rate fell sharply to 16.4 during the second half of June.Brazil.   Budget estimates for 1938 indicate a smaller prospective deficit than that estimated for 1937.    Imports for the first quarter of 1937 were 13% and exports 11% greater in value than a year before.Chile. Exports for the first four months of 1937 were 82% and imports 10% greater in value than a year before.     Liquidation of frozen credits has been resumed.Uruguay/. Exports in the first quarter of 1937 were 38% and imports 25% greater in value than a year before. Measures are in hand for the progressive redemption of debt.Peru.    The sol again depreciated in terms of sterling. Cotton prices declined;    the sugar market   was firm but quiet.Colombia. Both imports and exports were substantially greater in value in the first four months of 1937- than a year before.COLONIAL, TRAPS .     The rise in commodity prices has benefited Colonial territories and resulted in increased imports.    Although prices of several commodities (including cocoa) are now considerably below this year1s highest levels, the markets are much healthier.    The sugar producing colonies are expecting to benefit from both the higher prices and from the International Agreement which in general grants them increased export quotas for next season.    All Colonial territories seem likely to continue for the present to enjoy a fair measure of prosperity.
