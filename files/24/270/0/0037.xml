Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1937.Copy No.   50CABINET.RESERVES OF FOOD AND FOOD STORAGE.Memorandum by the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence.ON the 20th February, 1937, as Chairman of the Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence on Food Supply in Time of War, I submitted to the Cabinet a Memorandum (CP. 68 (37)) in which one of the recommendations was that a policy of food storage should be approved in&apos; principle, and that a scheme of storage, of which the capital cost was not to exceed  25,000,000, should be adopted. It was also recommended that a draft Bill should be prepared by the President of the Board of Trade to provide the necessary statutory authority for a storage policy.2. On the 24th February, 1937, the Cabinet agreed &quot; without taking any decision on the principle of building up a food reserve &apos;&apos; that &apos;&apos; with a view to consideration of the parliamentary aspects of the proposal for a reserve of foodstuffs, the President of the Board of Trade should prepare a Bill.&quot;3. I attach as Appendix I to this Note a Memorandum submitted by the President of the Board of Trade to the Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence on Food Supply in Time of War, which raises a number of important questions in regard to the provisions to be inserted in the Bill. The Sub-Committee at its Meeting on the 16th July, 1937, approved the proposals made in the Presidents Paper, but, before inviting the Board of Trade to undertake the difficult and arduous task of drafting the Bill, it was felt that the principle of a food storage policy should be brought again before the Cabinet in the light of the provisions to be incorporated in a draft Bill.4. I would remind my colleagues that many alternative schemes for food storage have been before the Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence since it was constituted in April of last year, and the question has been under consideration for many months. I have replied to this effect to a large number of Parliamentary questions. It is of the utmost importance, both from the point of view of defence requirements and of Parliamentary criticism, that some decision should be reached at an early date on the principle involved in order to clear the way for a statement to be made in the House of Commons when Parlia-ment re-assembles in November.i        5.   The Sub-Committee on Food Supply in Time of War has already, at its 1 5th Meeting on the 12th February last, expressed the necessity for a food storage policy as an essential defence requirement.  At its Meeting on the 16th July this view was strongly endorsed except by the President of the Board of Trade, who reserved his opinion.  The Chiefs of Staff, for reasons set out in paragraph 6 of I my Memorandum of the 20th February, 1937 (reproduced as Appendix II to this I Note), strongly supported the adoption of such a policy.   I must point out that the view there expressed relates to a war in which this country is engaged with Germany alone.   If our enemies included Italy or Japan, or both, as well as [15621] pSECRET. CP. 192 (37).
Germany, the risk of interference with our seaborne trade would be far greater owing to the despatch of part of our naval and air forces to distant localities. Serious responsibility will be incurred by any Government which neglects to take such steps as are reasonably practicable to provide a minimum insurance against a situation such as that envisaged by the Chiefs of Staff.6. Some of my colleagues may feel that the Governments recent decision regarding agricultural policy and the expenditure which is being incurred thereon provide an adequate substitute,, for a storage policy. I submit, however, that the problem which the agricultural schemes are designed to meet is different from that for which a food storage policy is required. The agricultural policy is designed to effect a larger expansion in home production during war than would otherwise be possible, but it does not in the slightest degree affect the problem of meeting a serious deficiency of supplies in the first nine to twelve months of a war before increased war-time home production is forthcoming.7. I wish to refer particularly to one feature of the Presidents proposals. The Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence, has. made strong representations upon the necessity for secrecy. It is vital that the enemy should not know the extent or location of our reserves., Secrecy is also important from the point of view of acquisition on the most favourable terms. It follows that the method of financing any authority which may be created to carry out the policy of food storage must be somewhat unorthodox. It cannot conform entirely to normal practice, and must, in my view, have sufficient elasticity to enable the controlling authority, subject to adequate safeguards, to make emergency purchases in, say, a precautionary period without the publicity attached to specific Parliamentary sanction. For this reason, and because it also tends to obscure in the mind of potential enemy enquirers the normal activities of the controlling authority, the Food Supply Sub-Committee supported the proposal of the President of the Board of Trade that, with appropriate safe-guards, the authority should possess borrowing powers. If the objections to this course are considered to be insuperable, some other form of financing the authority should be devised which will enable them to proceed with the minimum of publicity.8. ; I, therefore, invite my colleagues . /     (i) to approve in principle a policy of building up a food reserve to be kept in store.. (ii) to adopt as a basis the scheme known as Plan II, which provides, at an estimated cost of  20,000,000, for the existence in this country of stocks equivalent to three months&apos; consumption of certain key foodstuffs.       .(iii) to consider the actual sum to be allocated for this purpose in conjunctionwith the review of the Defence Programmes of the Service and certain Civil Departments which is to take place in the near future.(iv) to authorise the President of the Board of Trade to proceed with the &apos; :: preparation of a draft Bill on the basis set out in his Paper of the7th July, 1937,^yiz., the Bill-(a) to provide for the setting up of an ad hoc Commission to carry outthe executive work of building up and turning over the reserves.(b) to provide for a &quot;Food and Fertilisers &quot; Fund by Annual Votessupplemented by powers of borrowing subject to prescribed safeguards.(c) to be completed by the 1st November next.T. W. H. I.2 Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1, July 1937.
F.S. 38.APPENDIX I.RESERVE STOCKS (FOOD AND FERTILISERS) RILL.Note by the President of the Board of Trade.^ IT will be remembered that the Cabinet, on the 24th February last, without taking any decision on the principle of building up a food reserve, agreed that a Bill for this purpose should be prepared and circulated, to enable the Parliamentary aspects of the proposal to receive consideration.I now circulate, for the consideration of the Sub-Committee on Food Supply in Time of War, a Memorandum by the Food (Defence Plans) Department, raising some important questions respecting the provisions to be inserted in the Bill.Before arranging for a Bill to be drafted by Parliamentary Counsel, I should be glad to have the views of the members of the Sub-Committee in regard to the points mentioned in the last paragraph of the attached Memorandum.(Initialled)   O. F. G. S.Board of Trade, July 9, 1937.Memorandum on the Proposed Reserve Stocks (Food and Fertilisers) Bill.1. It is now four months since the Sub-Committee had before them the question of reserve stocks of foodstuffs. There may be advantage, therefore, in reviewing briefly the circumstances precedent to the Cabinet&apos;s decision (on the 24th February last) to ask the President of the Board of Trade to prepare for their consideration a Bill enabling him to acquire stocks in time of peace.2. Defence Considerations. Consideration of the question of building up reserves arose in part out of the experience of the Great War, but more particularly as a direct consequence of the greatly increased vulnerability of the British Isles to attack by shore-based aircraft. In a Memorandum on Trade Defence and Food Supply, the Joint Planning Sub-Committee of the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee (Paper No. F.S. 9) stated : &apos;&apos; 99. As regards air attack, although - the manj^ factors involved preclude us from answering the question in terms of percentage of supplies likely to be cut off, we consider that, if and when a first-class Power whose air bases lie within air striking range of our Home Waters decides to concentrate a great part of his air strength on unrestricted air attack against bur supply system, the position might become extremely serious. In such an event, unless our counter-offensive and defensive measures could within a short period effectively reduce the scale of attack, the shipping losses, combined with the dislocation at the docks and other vital points in the distributive system, resulting from material damage and its subsequent moral effect, might affect the maintenance of our supplies to an extent we have never hitherto experienced.100. If this is accepted, we must face the possibility that an enemy, weighing up all the factors involved, and arriving at the conclusion that unrestricted air attack would paralyse our war effort, might adopt such a course of action at the commencement of hostilities and would be likely to do so as an alternative to defeat.&quot; .[15621
3. In a subsequent note by the Naval Staff (Paper No. F.S. 31) it was further stated that the Admiralty was concentrating upon preparing plans to meet unrestricted submarine attack. While full confidence was expressed in the ability of the Navy to overcome this menace, it was emphasised that some delay in putting full defensive measures into operation would be inevitable. The enemy will start with &quot;the initial advantage of being able to exert his maximum effort at once, whereas counter-measures must take some time to build up.- &apos;       - i .:.4. Subsequently, the First Sea Lord gave the Sub-Committee the interpre-tation placed by the Chiefs of Staff upon the Trade Defence situation in terms of food supply. The problem to be examined, he explained, was that of a compara-tively short but very severe interference with imports of foodstuffs, and it was not in his opinion necessary to contemplate providing for a long period of acute shortage. He would regard a six months&apos; reserve as over-insurance and, while he was not prepared to oppose it on that account, he had in mind something more like three months.5. The Sub-Committee has assumed, therefore, that the object of building up. reserve stocks would be to meet the partial and temporary breakdown in supplies which may follow the outbreak of a major war with a country able to attack these shores with land-based aircraft. In addition, the Sub-Committee gave close consideration to the question of building up what was known as a &quot;London Reserve,&quot; i.e., a store which, could be brought into use immediately in the event of a large movement of the civil population from an area subject to intensive attack.6. Memorandum by the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence. In the early months of 1937 the Sub-Committee examined a number of alternative plans for creating a reserve, and in February the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence submitted to the Cabinet a full statement (Paper No. CP. 68 (37)) examining the situation as regards existing reserves and making, on behalf of the Sub-Committee, certain concrete recommendations. The Minister, after examining the present position* and the need for reserves, continued : &quot; In the 1914/18 war, at the time when pressure on the available shipping was at its height, food supplies were given priority over munitions. Under altered conditions we have now to face, in a future European War, the possibility of a far more serious, though temporary, dislocation in the supply of imported food and its distribution from certain existing storage centres than any we experienced in the last war. We cannot, in my view, assume responsibility for meeting such a situation, without having taken every step that is reasonably practicable to provide against such an emergency in advance. The Sub-Committee is satisfied that the need for some accumulation of reserves in peace-time is fully established.&quot;The Minister, having explained the alternatives considered, gave the recommendations of the Sub-Committee, that a policy of food storage should be approved by the adoption in principle of plans for increasing stocks of certain key foods to approximately three months&apos; supply at a cost not exceeding  25 million; and that the President of the Board of Trade should be asked to prepare a draft Bill enabling the Government to proceed with a storage policy.7. The Cabinet considered this Memorandum at its meeting on the 24th February, and, while deciding to reserve its position as regards adoption of a storage policy, asked the President of the Board of Trade to prepare a draft Bill for its consideration. It was also agreed to reduce the cost from  25 million to  20 million.8. Since the Sub-Committee made its recommendations, certain modifica-tions in the situation have occurred.   A more thorough examination of the* The following figures of minimum stocks held by the trades concerned were q,uoted: Wheat and flour, 8  weeks&apos; consumption; Sugar, 6 weeks&apos; consumption; ......, Meat.(excluding animals), less than 1 week&apos;s consumption; Butter, less than 1 week&apos;s consumption; .   i  .&quot;&apos;, Lard and margarine, less than 1 week&apos;s consumption;Cereals   for &apos; livestock,; imported   supplies   negligible home   crop   decreases   as ; &apos; season-progresses;Oilseed cake, 9 to 10 weeks&apos; consumption.
statistical situation: has been made by the Fopd (Defence Plans) Department than was previously possible, and this, while as yet incomplete, has disclosed an appreciable amount of additional unused storage space. In consequence, the building programme, which accounted for 1^ millions pf the capital cost of the proposal referred to in paragraph 6 above, could be greatly reduced and at any rate postponed for the time being. Of greater importance was the announcement by .the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries of the Governments proposals for increasing the fertility of the soil and for assisting the production of wheat, oats and barley, which hold out hopes of some eventual alleviation of our dependence upon imported feedingstuffs and fertilisers. At the same time these proposals add emphasis to the fact that in the early stages of war home agriculture cannot be expected to make any immediate increased contribution to the food supply.9. Draft Proposals for a Reserve Stocks (Food and Fertilisers) Bill. The principal objects of the Bill would be to give powers, in time of. peace, enabling the Government:  .  .(a) to obtain periodical returns of stocks of. food, feedingstuffs and fertilisersheld by traders;(b) to provide for supplementing stocks, where necessary, by contracting withtraders to increase their normal holdings;(c) to provide, where necessary, for the purchase and storage of additionalreserves; and(d) to turn over such additional reserves at intervals during peace-time toprevent their deterioration.10. To assist in the preparation of the Bill, the Board of Trade set up a Gommittee of Officials drawn from the Treasury, the Board of Trade, the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries and the Scottish Office. The Committee was asked to consider particularly (a) what safeguards should be inserted in the Bill to provide against the reduction of normal stocks held by traders pan passu with the creation of Government stocks; and to meet the wishes of the Chancellor of the Exchequer (now the Prime Minister).(&amp;) how the various transactions -storage, turnover, avoidance of waste, and so forth could be conducted to the maximum extent through the trade.11. As regards the first of these considerations, a number of confidential discussions have taken place with trade representatives, from which it seems clear that there is no cause to suppose that there would be any significant reduction of stocks consequent upon a decision by the Government to build up reserves. Few traders carry normal stocks sufficient to enable them to reduce below their existing minimum. Moreover, the fact that the Government held &quot; insulated reserves &quot; which it maintained at a pre-determined level would not, in itself, enable traders to reduce their commercial stocks. In general, it was agreed that,, unless the Government were to undertake a programme of very much greater dimensions than any they have so far been considering, the fear that private stocks would be reduced could be discounted. On the other hand, it was thought by everyone with whom the matter was discussed that it would be impossible for traders to offer any guarantee that individual firms would not vary their stocks from time to time in accordance with the conditions of the market. No provision, therefore, has been made in the Bill to provide against a reduction of normal stocks.12. Some apprehension was expressed by trade representatives lest the Government should liquidate its stocks without adequate warning, or in circum--stances that would be harmful to normal trade. It is thought that the provision proposed to be made in the Bill requiring the Board of Trade to present &quot; Arrangements &quot; to Parliament before winding up its reserves,&apos; coupled with a general assurance that once the initial purchases had been made there would be no intention to vary stocks appreciably, will be sufficient to allay any doubts on this account. .;...      -o , -     &apos;..      ...., , ,13. While no powers are thought necessary (or practicable) to safeguard against a reduction of normal stocks, it will be desirable to have,the fullest possible information as to stocks held in private hands and as to available storage space. Provision should be made in the Bill, therefore, enabling the Board of Trade and v(as regards stocks held on farms) the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries and
the Secretary of State for Scotland to secure this information and to have access to confidential information in the hands of Government Departments or Statutory bodies.14. The question of securing the co-operation of the trade in building up reserves is one of great importance. The technical problem of storage can be divided into two phases(1) The initial purchase of food or fertilisers and their storage in accommodation immune, as far as possible, from air attack. Purchase might be effected indirectly by contracting with commercial interests to supplement their existing stocks, or directly, by the Government becoming the owner of the reserves.(2) The maintenance of reserves in good marketable condition by periodically passing stocks into commerce and replacing them with fresh goods; the &quot;insulation &quot; of Government reserves from ordinary commercial stocks.15. Both the initial purchase of stocks and their subsequent maintenance and management over a period of years will require expert technical direction, particularly as regards the passing of stocks out of Government store into commerce and their replacement by new purchases. This problem does not, in itself, present any considerable administrative difficulties, and would consist in the main of the regular exchange of reserves for commercial stocks. It is clearly desirable that these functions should be performed with maximum effi-ciency and at the lowest possible cost to the Exchequer. It is of no less importance, however, that they should be carried out without friction, and that the maintenance of stocks should be closely co-ordinated with the ordinary processes of trade. To this end the co-operation of traders is essential and those responsible for carrying out Government policy will need to be in intimate and daily contact with them. It is thought that these objects will be most easily secured by estab-lishing, with Government finance, a Statutory Commission with a small, predominantly business, directorate under the Chairmanship of a distinguished public servant. The Commissioner would be subject to control by Ministers as regards the aggregate sum spent upon the purchase of food and fertilisers, and would require the general approval of Ministers in respect of its policy in regard to storage. It would, however, be entirely responsible for the executive work of building up of the necessary reserves, for the acquisition of storage space, and for the maintenance of stocks.16. The Food (Defence Plans) Department suggests the setting up of an ad hoc Commission for this purpose as the best means of combining (a) the control of policy by Ministers, with (b) the experience of business men in buying and selling, and (c) Civil Service control over finance and accounting. It is believed that a body of this character with a directorate able to command the confidence of industry need be no more disturbing to the market than any private company dealing in foodstuffs. It could give to the somewhat novel problem of storage continuous and expert direction that it might be difficult to achieve in a Govern-ment Department, while its administration might be more flexible and its decisions, &quot;in the changing circumstances of commodity markets, might be taken : more rapidly than is possible under Civil Service conditions.17. The Food (Defence Plans) Department propose, therefore, to provide in the Bill that there should be set up a National Food Reserve Commission which should become responsible to the Departments concerned for the purchase and maintenance of adequate reserves of food and fertilisers. The Bill would give&apos; the Commission three alternative methods of securing its reserves. It might either-.(a) Enter into contracts with individual private firms to supplement theirexisting commercial stocks; or(b) enter into similar contracts with an industry or a group of firms that hasformed itself into an Association for that purpose; or(c) itself become the owner of the reserves.   &apos;In addition it might be provided that where the Commission itself purchased stocks, it could, if it wished, have the assistance in maintaining these stocks of a Trade Advisory Committee set up for the purpose.
Food (Defence Plans) Department, Board of Trade, July 7, 1937.18. The view taken by the Treasury is that the cost of purchasing reserves should be met by annual votes and that they should be spread over as long a period as possible. It is proposed that provision should be made in the Bill on this basis. The Corporation, it is suggested, should present a programme of expenditure to Ministers for their approval, whereby the latter would be able to regulate the rate of accumulation of reserves, commencing, if necessary, with those commodities (e.g., meats and fats) of which supplies are especially low. - The Accounting. Officer of the Board of Trade would presumably be the Accounting Officer to the Commission, thus giving him a general power of supervision over the latter&apos;s financial arrangements.19. The financial requirements of the Commission fall under two heads. It would need, in the first place, capital for the purchase of any reserves it may itself acquire, and for its current administrative expenses. Secondly, it would need an annual sum to cover the costs of the maintenance and storage and of payments to private firms. Capital provided for the purchase of food could properly be regarded as in the nature of an investment for which the Government would hold collateral security, for since stocks would be maintained in good marketable condition, the Government, subject to any decline in world prices, would fully recover its expenditure when the time comes for liquidation. Unless present prices of primary commodities are held to be markedly in advance of an economic level (and in the case of certain important foodstuffs they are probably still well below this level), there is no reason why the Government should stand to lose. On the contrary, if good judgment is exercised in deciding on a suitable time to purchase each commodity, and if liquidation is undertaken at a favourable moment, they might even make money on the transaction. Sums spent on annual maintenance could not, of course, be recovered.20. Provision might be made in the Bill enabling both capital charges and maintenance charges to be met Out of annual votes by Parliament. At its meeting on the 12th February, however, the Sub-Committee, after having heard the views of the First Sea Lord, decided that it was essential to preserve complete secrecy as regards the size of the stocks held. The Food (Defence Plans) Department propose, therefore, that accounts shall be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General, but shall not be published for five years unless the Treasury so directs. It will not be disclosed, therefore, how the annual sum voted by Parliament is divided between the purchase of food by the Commission, its maintenance in store, and contractual payments to commercial firms. Finally, powers might be taken under the Bill for the Corporation to borrow, within certain limits, and subject to the approval of Ministers and of the Treasury. The primary purpose of these borrowing powers is still further to obscure the range of the Commission^ activities, for, theoretically, it would be possible for it to build up reserves greatly in excess of those purchased out of monies actually provided by Parliament. It is not intended that this provision should be used unless grave deterioration in the international situation should render it desirable to make additional purchases without disturbing public opinion. It is submitted, however, that&apos; such powers should be available, for otherwise the Government may be faced with an imperative need to increase its reserves at a time (e.g., during the &quot; precautionary period &quot;) when disclosure that buying was taking place on an increased scale might be politically harmful.-    -     Summary.21. Directions are asked for as to whether the Bill to be submitted to the Cabinet:-- (a) Shall provide for the setting up of an ad hoc Commission to carry out theexecutive work of building up and turning over the reserves.(b) Shall provide for a &apos;&apos; Food and Fertilisers &apos;&apos; Fund being fed by AnnualVotes, supplemented by powers of borrowing, subject to prescribed safeguards.(c) Should be completed by, say, the 1st November next.
APPENDIX II.Extract from Memorandum by the Minister for Co-Ordination of Defence, dated February 20, 1937 (Paper No. CP. 68 (37)).* * * * * -&apos;*    &apos;Need for Reserves.6. It is clear that sea-borne trade in imported food and feeding-stuffs must continue. The Naval and Air Staffs were asked to report how far our supplies of imported food and raw materials were likely to be interfered with by enemy attacks, particularly from the air, and as to the various steps to be taken to counter such attack. The Chiefs of Staff have made two reports on the matter, and whilst they are unable, in view of the many unpredictable factors concerned, to answer the problem in terms of the percentage of supplies likely to be cut off, they are satisfied that, in the event of war with Germany, so far as enemy naval action is concerned, the threat to our supplies is not likely to be comparable with that faced and overcome in 1914-18 (provided the necessary counter-measures are prepared in time of peace). On the other hand, as regards air attack, they say &apos;&apos; We consider that, if and when a first-class Power, whose air bases lie within air-striking range of our Home Waters, decides to concentrate the greater part of his air strength on unrestricted air attack against our supply system, the position might become extremely serious. In such an event., unless our counter-offensive and defensive measures can within a short period effectively reduce the scale of attack, the shipping losses, combined with the dislocation at the docks and other vital points in the distribution system, resulting both from material damage and its- subsequent moral effect, might affect the maintenance of our supplies to an extent we have never hitherto experienced.&quot;******
