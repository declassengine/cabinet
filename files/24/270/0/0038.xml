Printed for the Cabinet.  Jidy 1937.SECRET. Copy No.CP. 193 (37).CABINET.PALESTINE: ROYAL COMMISSION REPORT.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.I CIRCULATE herewith, for the information of my colleagues, extracts from letters from the High Commissioner for Palestine to Sir Cosmo Parkinson, the Permanent Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies, on the present situation in Palestine and Transjordan following the publication of the Report of the Palestine Royal Commission.(Initialled) W. O. G.Colonial Office,Downing Street, July 19, 1937.ANNEXURE.Letter from Sir Arthur Wauchope to Sir Cosmo Parkinson, dated July 10, 1937.Government House, Jerusalem, July 10, 1937.I HAVE just returned from a day in Amman. Kirkbride* warned me Abdullah thought partition would be implemented next month, and doubted if it were necessary to summons a new Legislative Council! ! So he was disappointed when I explained the actual situation.However, Abdullah is of course safely in favour of Partition; he tells me all Nablus and Jenin are also; and Kirkbride supports him in saying all Transjordan, save possibly a few landowners, are all on the same side. Kirkbride thinks the chances of trouble in Transjordan are now practically nix.We are going into the question of how many Arab families could be established in Transjordan given money to assist them. You know of course that the Jews&apos; idea of vast spaces waiting to be developed is as remote from actual facts as the idea that a starving peasantry are longing for Jews to settle in Trans-jordan and enrich them as they have enriched Palestine. Kirkbride, Bullardt and others tell me the people are delighted with the idea of Partition, as they consider that ends the idea of Jewish settlement in Transjordan. I believe with Partition it might come later slowly, gradually and happily.Anyway the country is content now, and the fellaheen have their best harvest for many a long year.  In Palestine the harvest is good, but not a bumper.* Mr. A. S. Kirkbride, O.B.E., M.C., Assistant Resident, Transjordan. f Sir Reader Billiard, K.C.M.G., G.I.E., British Minister at Jedda.[15631]
Edetracts from a letter from Sir Arthur Wauchope to Sir Cosmo Parkinson, dated july 14, 1937.Government House, Jerusalem, July 14, 1937.I OUGHT to let you know that since I wrote to you last the cause of Parti-tion has not flourished.Our very secret X intelligence officer tells me the public statement of the Iraqi Prime Minister has had a very. bad effect it is obvious that it would: Abdullah is also most indignant. Shertok* told me to-day that most people think that such a statement could only be issued with the approval of His Majesty&apos;s Government or the Foreign Office, and that it will stir Arabs in Palestine to make every resistance against Partition. I assured him I was quite certain His Majesty&apos;s Government deplored the Prime Ministers statement just as much as I did, but I imagined it would be very difficult for our Foreign Office to give orders to Iraq Prime Ministers.I did not tell Shertok I had seen Ibn Saud&apos;s telegram to his friend in Damascus, but I suppose Arab leaders in Palestine have known its unfortunate and most disappointing substance since the 10th July.I have no doubt these two statements have been a most powerful factor in causing Ragheb Bey and the Nashashibi Defence Party publicly to declare their opposition to Partition, whereas a week ago Ragheb and Farraj told me freely, without being asked, they were definitely in favour of the principle of Partition.Nor have I any doubt that the Mufti and Auni are using all their influence against Partition; as are the Jews especially the powerful Labour Organisation, who have 90 delegates out of 124 from Palestine for the Congress at Zurich.But I noticed in my last talk with Shertok he made a definite distinction between Partition and the scheme of the Royal Commission.I had some satisfactory conversations with Godfrey, Captain of H.M.S. Repulse now in Haifa. We have made arrangements for the tranfer of the Mufti to the Repulse should he in any way commit himself, and I enclose a copy of a telegram from Godfrey to Admiral Pound, Commander-in-chief of Mediter-ranean fleet.Should rows develop say after the arrest of the Mufti, it would be useful to have power to send some lesser fry to Malta for a short period.We had considerable hope that the Mufti was about to contravene the law as regards holding a meeting without Police approval, in which case I should have immediately deported him, I am sure with the full approval of the Secretary of State. As I said in London it may not be possible to refer to you before deportation, because if the Mufti gets a hint he may disappear right away into Al A ksa Mosgue and remain inaccessible. But I feel as Mufti is working against partition, and is clearly a source of unrest in the country, should he contravene the law in the smallest degree the Secretary of State would approve of his immediate deportation; if I am not correct in this please wire me immediately. It is said that the fact that the Mufti has so far survived the strictures passed on him in the Commission^ Report without any action being taken against him by the Government is responsible for the suppression of open and free expression of opinion by many moderate Arabs who are afraid because of possible reprisals of publicly stating their views. I feel there is some force in this conclusion and I am considering whether it would be possible to &apos;&apos; clip his wings.&apos;&apos; But we shall have to go carefully.Dill, always in a most friendly way, says something more should be done to support Partition, but the question is what? I cannot speak more definitely till His Majesty&apos;s Government are in a position to give definite decisions as to the form of Partition and the all-important boundary line. The only suggestion of any importance that Dill has offered is that we should tell Ragheb that a well-wisher has given him  10,000 if he declares himself in favour of Partition and we should then hand him over that sum; any such action if approved would not, of course, be done openly so that it could be attributed to the Government, though I fear charges would certainly be made later.  There is little doubt that he could* A leading member of the Executive of the Jewish Agency in Palestine.
be bought for that sum. In the first place such acts are apt to rebound on the head of the giver; in the second place Ragheb is a completely unreliable figure  inconstant, chameleonlike, but at present desirous to keep in with Government. I shall do nothing more about this proposal unless you tell me it should be considered. I think we shall get some fair articles inserted in the Falastin newspaper in a roundabout way, but I fear they will have little influence.I am not by any means despairing of Partition. It has had a set-back and the sacrifices entailed by acceptance of Royal Commission are severe for both sides.(3)Copy of Telegram to Admiral Pound, Commander-in-chief, Mediterranean, from Captain Godfrey, Commanding HM.S. Repulse, July 14, 1937,Under certain circumstances which may shortly arise High Commissioner contemplates arrest of two or three prominent Arab leaders and placing them on board His Majesty&apos;s ship at Haifa prior to deportation to Seychelles.Measures have been concerted with the High Commissioner and General Dill to give effect to above. Ship will anchor outside breakwater so as to obviate possibility of demonstration on wharf.High Commissioner is anxious to know if arrangements of last year.still hold good by which leaders could be taken promptly to Seychelles and how soon ship could reach Haifa.High Commissioner and General Dill are reluctant that normal guard ship should leave Haifa, even temporarily, after this arrest, until excitement has -subsided.
