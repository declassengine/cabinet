Confidential appreciation of the Political situation in India, dated the 21st July, 1937, issued on the authority of the Secretary of State for India.1.       North West Frontier.       Operations in Waziristan continue hut the situation now shows distinct signs of improvement.    There are no large bodies of hostile tribesmen in existence and only small gangs of irreconcilables continue to give trouble.    A temporally settlement has been made with the Tori Khel and some of their Khassadars have been re-employed at reduced rates of pay.    The Mahsuds have also handed over a number of prominent tribesmen as hostages pending a final settlements The terms to be announced to the tribes concerned in the disturbances are at present under consideration.    All Hindus in the hands of tribesmen have been released except two, one of whom was kidnapped in a raid in the Bannu-  District at the beginning of July.    This raid was the only serious offence committed by the Y/aziristan tribesmen in settled districts during the month.      The Faqir of Ipi however remains at large in the vicinity of Mahsud-Bhittani border and continues his propaganda. 2. The troops have been busy dispersing collectionsof hostile tribesmen in the Shaktu Valley and in the Shakai and Mahsud Khaisora Valley.    The principal operations have been in the latter area.    On June 23rd an action was fought in very difficult   country in the vicinity of Sharawangi Narai on the Razmak - Wana Road. The enemy were dispersed with heavy casualties but Lieut.Col.Grant of the Guides Infantry and 8 Indian other ranks were killed and 1 British officer and 1 Indian officer and 33 Indian other ranks wounded.     Another action took place on June 29th in Shakai when a body of hostile
tribesmen, numbering about 300, was taken by surprise and severely punished, the enemy losing 34 killed and 29 severely wounded.      Since then there has been no large concentration of hostile tribesmen in any part of Waziristan.     An incident which deserves mention is the rounding up of 3aramand in Shaktu Valley on June 21st by Waziristan Scouts assisted by regular troops.    A complete surprise was effected and 12 prisoners were captured including Arsal Khan, a prominent Tori Khel hostile, who had been the Faqir of Ipi&apos;s host for several months. Two kidnapped Hindus were also found in stocks awaiting ransom and were released&apos;3.       The Congress decision.     A sudden turn has- been given to the political situation by the decision of the Congress Working Committee to accept office, Mention.    has been made in past appreciations of the increasing discontent felt by Congress rank and file at the refusal to take office in six provinces, except on impossible conditions.    On 22nd June, after a short broadcast on the previous evening, the Governor-General issued a message to India in which he surveyed the constitutional issues involved.    In this pro-pronouncement, while explaining again why the Governors could not grant the assurances which Congress demanded, he showed clearly the reality of power and responsibility which is transferred under the new constitution to the elected Ministries and, on behalf of his Government and of Parliament, expressed the sincere wish that this transfer of power should be accepted without distrust.    Striking tribute has been paid sometimes in unexpected quarters to the effect of this pronouncement.    It was acknowledged   to be beyond criticism m tone and, read with previous utterances of the Secretary and Parliamentary Under Secretary of State, to have cleared away almost every possibility of misunderstanding.       The right wing Congress
3.Press strongly pressed the view that there remained no valid argument against office acceptance.    Even the extremist Press acknowledged His Excellency&apos;s sympathetic and conciliatory attitude.    Amid this rising tide of feeling in favour of office acceptance the Working Committee of the All-India Congress Committee met at Wardha on 5th July.The unfathomability of Gandhi&apos;s mind and the known desire to avoid a split with the left Wing headed by the Congress President, Pandit J4L. Nehru, made the Committee&apos;s decision uncertain till the last moment.      On July 7th, the Committee passed a resolution permitting Congressmen to accept office where they may be invited thereto.4.       It may be useful to summarise briefly the development in the attitude of Congress in the last year. Its election manifesto was issued in August, 1936.      This stated the necessity of independence from British control as prerequisite for national regeneration:    affirmed opposition to India&apos;s participation in war dictated by British imperialists:    defined the purpose of sending Congressmen to the legislatures as the combating and ending of the new constitution and declared that in the legislature and outside they would seek to strengthen the people and develop the conditions essential for freedom. The detailed programme included the abolition of all &quot;repressive&quot; legislation, the release of &quot;political&quot; prisoners, reform of land tenure, relief of indebtedness, great improvements in the lot of industrial labour, civic equality for humblest communities and sweeping reform in prison administration.      Also absolute hostility to the introduction of federation was affirmed.At the annual session at Faizpur in December the determination to combat and end the new constitution was
4.re-affirmed:    the election manifesto was endorsed and Congressmen exhorted to demand, inside and outside the legislatures, the summoning of a &quot;constituent assembly&apos;1 for the framing of an acceptable constitution.In February of this year immediately after the general election the aims of Congress were repeated at a meeting of the Working Committee:    and stress was laid on the necessity for contact and discipline in organisation from villagers upwards.       Then followed the All-India Congress Committee meeting at Delhi which, on 18th March, passed the notorious resolution permitting acceptance of office in the Provinces v/here Congress commands a majority, provided each leader was satisfied and could state publicly that the Governor would not use his special powers of interference or set aside the advice of Ministers in regard to constitutional activities.Immediately after, a &quot;convention&quot; of provincial legislators and others met and a solemn oath was taken to work for the independence of India and the furtherance of Congress aims.At Allahabad, towards the end of April, the working Committee approved the refusal of office that had followed on the Delhi decision.      Though its resolution proceeded to explain what that decision did and did not mean,&apos; the result was to leave its terms unchanged. The next development was the Wardha volte-face of July 7th. Lest however that should be interpreted as an acceptance of the constitution, the resolution referred to the relation of Britain and India as that of the &quot;exploiter and the exploited&quot;:    and explicitly affirmed that office was to be accepted for the purpose of combating the Act and prosecuting the programme of the election manifesto.
5.5. No audible voice has been raised for the summoning of full All-India Congress Committee to endorse the Working Committee   decision.      It &quot;has been acclaimed by all sections of Congress except the extreme left.    In accordance with it the minority, in the 6 Provinces in which Congress are in a majority, ministries in the Legislatures are vanishing from the scene, and ministries are being formed by Congress leaders.    The public spirit shown by those who formed minority ministries,  the good work done by them and the value of this interlude for the emergence of wiser counsels are recognised by sober opinion.But the professed determination of the new ministries to combat the constitution;    the difficulty of conversion in a moment,  from long and determined intransigeance, to the exercise of authority, the impracticability of some of the election promises, possibility of left wing pressure on the retention of control at Congress centre over actions of each provincial ministry - these are disturbing circumstances which have to be set against the undoubted gain of the moment in hope and goodwill. 6. Moslem and Congress.    - The drive to draw the moslem community into the Congress fold continues but without any noticeable success.      The Moslem League has taken a determined stand against Congress,  and a bye election at present being fought in the United Provinces between Congress and Moslem League candidates has aroused some bitterness.7. Communal trouble.  -   Communal relations are severelystrained in parts both of British India and of the Indian States.    Troops had to be called out in Kashmir State.    Incidents have occurred in the United Provinces Hyderabad State and Sind while in the Punjab disturbances
6.have &quot;been widespread and serious.    In Western Punjab in particular relations between Sikhs and Moslems are increasingly unsatisfactory.    The worst incident occurred in Gujarat District where, following the funeral of a murdered Sikh, Moslems attacked a small body of Sikhs and police were compelled to fire on 6 occasions to protect themselves and the Sikhs.Three Sikhs and four Moslems were killed and fourteen Sikhs and six Moslems wounded.      The body of one of the Sikhs was taken to Amritsar, where, during the funeral procession, a dangerous outbreak occurred in v/hich three Moslems were killed and fifty-four persons were injured. Fortunately, the outbreak was confined to a small area and was quickly checked.8.      The Palestine Report.      At the time of writing not enough time has passed since the publication of the report and of the decision of His Majesty&apos;s Government to permit a considered estimate of their reception.      Mohammedan opinion is hostliej/^but expressions of that opinion have been fairly mild and/almost conventional in tone:    and no symptoms have yet appeared of organised or. Vehement protest.9.      General.      Though the Congress decision has absorbed attention, it must be remembered that normal ministerial government has been proceeding and proceeding smoothly in five Provinces.      A session of one Legislature is proceeding; and experience has already shown not only the reality of ministerial power but the power which a reasonably well organised opposition has to exert pressure on a Ministry even where that Ministry has assured support of a stable majority.
