O. Stewart, 25th May, 1937.
Introduction.ON the 8th April, 1937, the Sub-Committee on Defence Policy and Requirements had under consideration a Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home Department on the financial Aspects of Air Raid Precautions (Paper No. D.P.R. 181).2. This Memorandum, together with the Minutes and Conclusions of the Sub-Committee, was laid before the Cabinet at a meeting held on the 14th April, 1937, when the following conclusions were recorded : &apos;&apos; (a) That negotiations with the local authorities should be suspended pending reconsideration by a Committee of the adjustment of the Depart-mental responsibility connected with Air Raid Precautions. (b) That the Chancellor of the Exchequer should draft the composition and terms of reference of the Committee in consultation with the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence, the Home Secretary, the Minister of Health and the Secretary of State for Scotland.&quot;3. In accordance with the above conclusions the Prime Minister directed that we should be set up as a Sub-Committee (i) To examine the proposals made as to the nature, scale and distribution of Air Raid Precautions Services, including hospital and fire brigade services.(ii) To report upon the proper distribution of responsibility between central and Local Authorities, and (so far as may be desirable) voluntary organisations.(iii) To  suggest  any  necessary adjustments  of  present  departmental responsibility and organisation resulting from the growth and develop-ment of the problem.4. The specific questions remitted to us in our terms of reference cannot in our opinion be adequately dealt with unless consideration is given to the two following matters : First, what are the true aims of Air Raid Precautions Services ? Secondly, what is the probable scale of attack ?Aims of Air Raid Precautions Services.5. We think that the aims of the Air Raid Precautions Services can be defined as follows : (a) to maintain the morale of the people;(b) to ensure the continued functioning of the activities which are vital tothe effective prosecution of the war and the life of the community;(c) to reduce to a minimum the destruction of life and property likely to beproduced by air raids.6. This general statement of the position is, we think, likely to command general assent. The real difficulty arises when we come to consider what proportion of the resources available for defence as a whole should be employed on Air Raid Precaution Services..7. In our view this matter cannot be determined by any single criterion. It is necessary to deal with it by reference to the following general considerations : First, that passive defence measures form only a part of our general defensive preparations, and that the claims of passive defence must be considered in conjunction with the claims of active defence. In this connection it must be remembered that no amount of passive defence measures will end a war, and that a proper balance must be maintained between active and passive measures.Secondly, it must be recognised from the outset that it is impossible to secure anything approaching 100 per cent, security by passive defence measures. An illustration of the fantastic cost of providing 100 per cent, security is that the [15492] &quot; b 2
cost of provision of bomb-proof underground shelters for the population in the danger zone alone has been estimated at approximately  1,500 million.Thirdly, while it is impossible to provide anything like 100 per cent, protec-tion against air raids, it is essential to ensure that a reasonable degree of protection is afforded in the light of the weight of attack likely to be encountered. Other-wise the war might well be lost on the home front through panic, or a breakdownA&apos;M*, /K   Scale of Enemy Air Attack.8. We were informed that the Air Staff had calculated that by April 1939 a continuation of the present rate of German Air Force expansion would give them a potential bomb load of 2,250 tons. By a process of reduction on account of counter-offensive measures, mechanical failures, diversion against France (presumed to be our Allies) and aircraft casualties, this figure was reduced to an estimated attack against this country of an average of over 600 tons of bombs per diem during the first few weeks. Feeling that it was possible that full allowance had not been made for the effects of our own counter air attack, we requested a reconsideration of this estimate. This request elicited the informa-tion that the Air Staff adhere to their estimate of an average of over 600 tons of bombs per diem. They pointed out that in arriving at this estimate they had allowed for a reduction of approximately 30 per cent, -of the enemy&apos;s bombing effort due to the effect of our counter air attack. They did not consider that any further reduction in the scale of attack could be expected from our counter-offensive for at least several weeks What was more likely to happen was that if in the course of attacks on a particular objective the enemy sustained at the hands of the fighters and anti-aircraft defences more than a certain daily percentage of casualties, they would temporarily divert the main weight of such attack to other objectives.The Air Staff added that we should be prepared for a special bombing effort on the part of the enemy in the first 24 hours which might amount to 3,500 tons. In anticipation of the approval of the Committee of Imperial Defence, to whom this matter has been referred by the Home Defence Committee, we have therefore based our recommendations on this general view.9.. A comparison of this estimate with what actually occurred during the last War, when the total weight of bombs dropped on the whole country through-out the war was under 300 tons, and did not exceed 5 tons in any one period of twenty-four hours, brings into strong relief the magnitude of the problem which confronts us to-day. Moreover, we have now to think in terms, not only of an increased scale of attack, but of new methods of attack for which past experience affords no precedents.10. On the basis of the last war the average casualties per ton was 50 (17 killed and 33 wounded). This will serve as a measure of what the casualties might be, subject to the caveat that modern bombs are more effective. While we, of course, are not qualified to express any technical opinion on the potentialities of modern air bombardment, we feel entitled to point out that an arithmetical computation on the above basis for the scale of attack at 600 tons per diem would indicate casualties of the order of 200,000 a week, of which 66,000 would be killed.11. It may be well to note that Paper No. D.P.R. 181 did not make any reference to the problem of evacuation of population, the financial implications of that problem being quite uncertain. The extent to which, by measures concerted in peace, it may be possible to arrange for the rapid evacuation of population, especially from the London area, at the onset of emergency has an obvious and important bearing not only on air raid precautions as, e.g., in regard to hospital accommodation, but also on other war preparations as, e.g., the supply and transport of food stuffs. We are advised that the problem is under intensive consideration by- the Air Raid Precautions Department.12. Broadly speaking, air raid precautions are designed to meet two distinct but concurrent sets of conditions :- . (i^ The damage to life and property caused by aircraft, and (ii) The panic and disorganisation created by air raids.of essential services.The Nature of Air Raid Precautions.
The problem as regards (i) is essentially physical. The measures contem-plated include a scheme for air raid warning, arrangements for lighting restrictions,. the provision of respirators and protective clothing, first-aid and hospital treatment of casualties, decontamination of personnel and material, rescue parties, emergency- fire brigade services, emergency communication systems, protection of buildings against bomb attack and gas, the protection of vital services, the recruiting and training of personnel, and the structural alterations of buildings specifically required for Air Raid Precautions Services, as well as advice on administrative and technical matters.13. As regards (ii), the problem is, in the main, psychological, and for this reason the more incalculable. Panic will not be confined to those places which may be expected to be the object of deliberate attack- though it will be admittedly greatest in those areas but will be spread along the whole path of attack, and may even extend over the whole area under warning. Under these conditions, the first aim of air raid precautions must be the maintenance of the morale of the people. We feel that this can best be achieved by frank explanation of the risks to which the civilian population may be exposed, and by making them realise, through their own participation in the measures designed to meet them, that the problem has been thought out and organised by the Government with a view to providing as much protection as is reasonably possible.Scale and Distribution of Air Raid Precautions Services.14. The scale and distribution of Air Raid Precautions Services fall to be determined in the light of the overriding considerations set out in the earlier section of our Report. There are, however, two more specific factors which must be mentioned, namely : (a) the period of warning which may be expected before the war breaks out;(b) the liability of particular areas to air attack.As regards the former point, it was proposed in Paper No. D.P.R. 181 that general preparations should be made by local authorities upon the basis that a 4-day period of warning could be relied upon. This 4-day period, which was admittedly arbitrary, was selected in order to provide some convenient means of determining what parts of Air Raid Precautions Services could be left until an emergency arose. We think, however, that it would be somewhat misleading to suggest that this period should be applied at all rigidly. Broadly speaking, we think that Air Raid Precautions measures should be carried so far that they can be completed within a relatively short space of time. To carry the matter further would involve not only heavy additional expenditure, but also a considerable dislocation of the normal life of the community, e.g., by alterations for Air Raid Precautions purposes to buildings which are, at present, in use as schools.15. As regards the liability of particular areas to air attack, the country has been divided by the Home Office into five grades, tapered according to their estimated vulnerability in such a manner that localities in the fifth grade may only receive as little as one-seventh of the protection allowed for localities in the first grade. Acting on this principle, we consider that it will be possible to arrive at a fair estimate of the degree of protection which it would be reasonable to provide for each locality, gradually and empirically; by a detailed examination of its peculiar circumstances on the spot. In areas where there is a concentration of important targets, as, for example, in Yorkshire, the local authorities are being urged to co-operate closely in regional schemes with a view to an economical pooling of resources.16. There remains the question of those unexposed localities where the risk of deliberate attack is remote. We have given careful consideration to what justification^ if any, there is for the inclusion of these in the scheme of air raid precautions. We have come to the conclusion that such justification does, in fact, exist on the ground of the possibility of bombs being dropped indiscriminately owing to the failure of the enemy to find or reach his intended objective. The reality of this danger has been forcibly brought home to us by the fact that a single aeroplane is to-day capable of dropping 2,000 incendiary bombs, which
would be sufficient to cause widespread destruction in any built-up area. Furthermore, there is the advantage to be derived from fostering a patriotic desire on the part Of these less vulnerable localities to come into the front line to the help of heavily smitten neighbours. An intelligent exploitation of such enthusiasm would serve the double purpose of educating public opinion and building up a useful reserve. Except for fire precautions which entail the provision of appliances and training for personnel, the details of such schemes would, in the main, amount to no more than plans drawn up locally which would not need to be implemented until an actual attack, and which would, in most cases, involve no contribution from the Government beyond advice.17. Broadly speaking, the Air Raid Precautions measures dealt with in Classes A to E of Paper No. D.P.R. 181 were worked out on the general basis indicated in this Report, and we have reached the conclusion that, while any estimate prepared at the present stage is bound to be somewhat conjectural, the proposals set out under those heads give a fair indication of the nature of the Services required, and of the order of expenditure which they are likely to involve. We recommend that these proposals should be accepted in principle as repre-senting the Deficiency Programme of the Air Raid Precautions Department^ Particulars of these have been extracted from Paper No. D.P.R. 181 and are reproduced as Appendix I to our Report.*18. We attach great importance to the principle of grading mentioned in paragraph 15 above. We regard it as essential that the degree of vulnerability of each area should be the primary consideration in assessing the degree of protection to be accorded. This factor must, therefore, be given full weight when the schemes submitted by local authorities are considered.19. We have been informed that the requirements of Air Raid Precautions in man-power have been estimated at 1,398,500. Of these, less than 200,000 need be men under the age of 40; 170,000 are women; and 350,000 can be of either sex. Approximately half of the total will be required on a part-time basis only. These requirements, which are yet another example of the need for correlation between all the demands likely to be made on our man-power reserve in time of war, are under consideration by the Man-Power Sub-Committee.20. It will be noted that we have expressly excluded mention of certain other measures contained in Paper No. D.P.R. 181 as follows : (i) Hospitals (Class &quot; F &quot; on Page 13 of Paper No. D.P.R. 181).The question of the necessary measures for the treatment of civilian air casualties in Base Hospitals is one which we have felt required reconsider a-tion in the light of the present estimated scale of air attack. We consider that Base Hospitals must be treated on a national basis and recommend that the question should be re-examined on the arbitrary basis of a present estimated deficiency of 87,000 beds for which the necessary buildings already exist; and that requirements in excess of these should be met by a scheme of improvisation.We have accordingly requested that the problem should be reviewed by a special Sub-Committee, and this has now been set up by the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence.(ii) Measures to protect Vital Services. (Part IV on Page 14 of PaperNo. D.P.R. 181.)There are in the country a number of public services, the maintenance and safeguarding of which would be vital to the effective prosecution of the war and the life of the community. The most important of these services-are : Electricity, Water, Domestic Gas, Railways, Docks and Oil Supplies. Measures for the protection of these are being considered separately by a special Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence.* The total expenditure to be made under these heads from Exchequer and/or Local Government Funds is estimated at  12,725,000 capital plus  1,800,000 annually. The capital, expenditure excludes expenditure which&apos; it is considered need not be carried out unless an emergency is imminent (see paragraph 14 above of our Report).It will be understood that these estimates of cost are exclusive of central expenditure (other than grants) which has been or will be incurred by the Air Raid Precautions Department,. e.g., on Gas Schools, Anti-Gas Equipment, &amp;c.   (See paragraph 73 of Paper No. D.P.R. 181).
(iii) Protection against the effects of blast and splinters from high explosive bombs.   (Part V on Page 15 of Paper No. D.P.R. 181.)&apos;The Defence Policy and Requirements Sub-Committee have recently had before them a.recommendation put forward by the Principal Supply Officers Committee that the accumulation of the proposed reserve of 500 million sand-bags should be spread over a period of six years. The Sub-Committee agreed to authorise the Air Raid Precautions Department to enter into negotiations for the purchase of a six months&apos; quota of sandbags on the above basis, i.e., 42 million, approximately, or such lesser quantity as the industry could provide in the normal course. According to the estimate furnished by the Principal Supply Officers Committee, the cost of accumulating the whole of the reserve of 500 million sandbags would amount to  5 million.(iv) A further proposal, not included in Paper No. D.P.R. 181, to which our attention has been drawn is for the structural alteration of new dwellings. The estimated cost at  60 per house would involve an annual charge of  6,300,000 for the present annual housing programme of 80,000 new houses in England and 25,000 in Scotland, and would entail an addition of Is. per week in the rents. This implies so large an additional burden on our social services, that its adoption must, in our opinion, be subordinated to the primary consideration that these houses should be available at a reasonable rent. We therefore recommend that no public announcement should be made regarding structural alterations in respect of subsidised housing schemes. At the same time we are anxious to encourage the building of houses and of other places in which protection against air attack is provided, and we think that the Air Raid Precautions Department should continue to make information available on this subject so long as it is made clear that no. Government financial assistance will be given.The Distribution of Responsibility between the Central andLocal Authorities.21. The general principle governing the relations between the Central and Local Authorities in regard to Air Raid Precautions were described in the Home Office and Scottish Office Circulars of the 9th July, 1935, as follows : &apos;&apos; The Government will issue general instructions based on expert study of the problem and will be ready to give technical and administrative advice and to afford financial assistance . . . . but responsibility will rest on local authorities for ensuring that adequate measures of civil protection against air raid dangers are taken in their own districts.&quot;We consider that this should continue to be the policy, but it is clear that control of the design and manufacture of emergency fire fighting appliances must be exercised centrally.22. The general scheme of air raid precautions comprises a network of local schemes, each of which will vary according to the peculiar conditions of each locality, and to the degree of attack to which each is exposed. These local schemes will be subject to examination by the central authority on the basis of the general principles referred to in paragraph 15 above, and Exchequer grants should be made in aid of such schemes only so far as they are approved by the central authority.23. The scope of the responsibilities of the Central and Local Authorities respectively, was set forth in the Home Office and Scottish Office Circulars of the 9th July, 1935. We attach this list as Appendix II to our Report, and recommend that it should be accepted as the basis of the distribution of responsibility between Central and Local Authorities, subject to any necessary adjustments with regard to emergency Fire Brigade measures.24. The functions assigned to local authorities in this Appendix are such as they ought, in the1 interests of their own population, to be ready to undertake, and such as only they can effectively perform. To throw such functions on the Central Authority would be to overload it, with resulting loss of efficiency and possible breakdown of the system.
, - 25. The object must be to enlist the full and, indeed, enthusiastic co-opera-tion of local authorities, and it has to be admitted that the degree in which this co-operation will be given will to some extent depend on the financial arrange-ments made between local authorities and the Exchequer. We have noted the suggestions put forward as to these in Paper No. D.P.R. 181. They are generally percentage grants and that method is apt to be unavoidable to secure the establish-ment of a new service. The percentages suggested vary to a large extent, but we assume that it is not thought practicable to fix a uniform percentage or to extend further the method (proposed to be applied to the training of auxiliary firemen) of a fixed grant for specific units of service. As the Exchequer percentage in a percentage grant rises above the percentage of the expenditure found locally, there is increasing risk of loss of efficiency and economy in the service. The percentage in this, as in other:cases, can only be determined in the process of bargaining, but we trust that any payment in excess of a half-and-half basis will be conceded only on the clearest proof that it is indispensable to get the work done.26. Turning to voluntary organisations, we find that use is already being made of a number of existing Societies, notably the Order of St. John, St. Andrew&apos;s Ambulance Association, the British Red Cross and the British Legion. Recently, there has come forward a suggestion to form a Civil Defence Service, to be devoted to the particular requirements of air raid precautions on the lines of similar leagues which exist in Germany and Switzerland. Draft Articles of Association have been drawn up, and provided these and its credentials are satisfactory we feel that the services of this organisation might be usefully employed in certain directions, e.g., in educating and organizing public opinion, as an agency for obtaining recruits, in plans for evacuation, and in the remoter localities. The participation of any organization of this type would not be possible unless (i) it acts in close co-operation with, but under, the Local Authorities;(ii) in no way interferes with the proper responsibilities of Local Authorities;(iii) is financially self-supporting; and(iv) is non-political and embraces every section of the community.Adjustment of Present Departmental Responsibility and Organisation.27. In considering the adjustment of present Departmental responsibility and organisation which may be necessary as a result of the growth and develop-ment of air raid precautions, we have been impressed by the variety of the interests involved and the consequent interlocking of Departments. But, whilst we do not wish to minimise the variety of Departmental interests in this matter, we take the view that the novel problem of air raid precautions needs unified and separate treatment, and that on this account responsibility for it must be vested in a single authority. We therefore recommend that in time of peace this responsibility should continue to rest with the Home Secretary as the Minister, more than any other, responsible in England and Wales for the services such as-police and firejsrotection, which have the most bearing on the public safety.Co-ordination of Policy.28. It will, at the same time, be necessary to establish a system of co-ordina-tion which will ensure not only an agreed translation of policy into action upon an agreed and concerted plan of administration, but also, as an essential pre-requisite, agreement on policy itself, and on any public announcement in. connection therewith.29.   We therefore recommend (i) that questions of major policy, as well as of appeals on policy resultingfrom Departmental differences of opinion, should be referred to the Sub-Committee on Defence Policy and Requirements, all Ministers concerned attending as Members of that Committee with the object of representing the views of their respective Departments;(ii) that, in addition to the normal methods of consultation, co-co-ordination between the various Departments in time of peace should be facilitated by a Joint Standing Inter-Departmentai Committee, and that the Members of this Committee should be of sufficient rank to ensure executive effect being given to decided policy.  This Committee
will include members from all the Departments concerned in, or affected by, air raid precautions, and from the Committee of Imperial Defence, which will, in addition, provide a Joint Secretary.Finance.   .30. We consider that it is desirable that, so far as practicable, all expendi-ture from the Exchequer in providing the air raid precautions services dealt with in this Eeport should be borne on a single Vote. The only exceptions to this rule which we would suggest are as follows : (i) In accordance with the normal practice, expenditure on buildings and stationery provided by the Office of Works and Stationery Office should be borne on the Votes of those Departments, particulars of such expenditure being given in the usual statement as to Allied Services, (ii) A limited amount of expenditure which is attributable to air raid precautions will be incurred in respect of, e.g., schools or police buildings. Where such expenditure would qualify for grant under an already existing scheme, we suggest that it should continue to be dealt with in this manner and that provision should be made in the Estimates of the Department or service concerned. It will be appreciated that where expenditure is being incurred on, for example, police buildings, it will often be difficult to determine what parts of the expenditure are attributable to air raid precautions, and it seems undesirable to modify the existing arrangements for payment of grant in such cases.The special Case of Scotland.31. We have given special consideration to the case of Scotland, and we recommend (i) that the Secretary of State for Scotland, acting through the scottish office, should continue to be responsible for all Scottish fire brigade matters, co-ordination of fire brigade administration being secured by consultation between the Home Office and the Scottish Office, and the sharing of inspectorial, technical and advisory staff.(ii) that financial provision for measures of air raid precautions relating to existing grant-aided services (e.g., Police and Education) should be borne on Scottish Votes.(iii) that financial provision for other measures of air raid precautions,including emergency fire brigade services, should be borne on the1 Vote of the Air Raid Precautions Department. An arrangement will be made between the Home Office and the Scottish Office whereby authority will be delegated to the Scottish Office to sanction expendi-ture on Scottish schemes up to an agreed limit.(iv) that the Air Raid Precautions Department should deal direct withScottish Local authorities on all matters of air raid precautions other than matters relating to fire brigade services or existing grant-aided services, after such consultation as may be necessary, with the Scottish Office.(v) that where the Air Raid Precautions Department delegates the executionof parts of schemes to English Departments (e.g., the Ministry of Health) there should be a similar delegation to the corresponding Scottish Department.(vi) that co-ordination in respect of Scotland should be provided by normalconsultation between the Home Office and the Scottish Office, by the representation of the Scottish Office on the Joint Standing Inter-Departmental Committee, and by the membership of the Secretary of State for Scotland of the Sub-Committee on Defence Policy and Requirements when questions of policy are referred to that Committee.(vn) that  the legislation empowering  the payment  of  grants  to  local authorities should include a provision to the effect that grants payable direct to Scottish local authorities by the Air Raid Precautions Department  should  not  be  approved  or   refused  except  after ...        consultation with the Secretary of State for Scotland.(vm) that the Secretary, of State for Scotland should be responsible for answering questions or criticisms in the House of Commons on Scottish aspects of air raid precautions. [15492]
Enlargement of the A ir Raid Precautions Department.32. Finally, we have considered the position of the Air Raid Precautions Department in the light of the additional responsibilities and work which will fall on it as the central authority charged with the general direction and super-vision of work throughout the country. We are convinced that in time of war it will be necessary for the Central Authority to assume a greater measure of control and that it may well be necessary to place the Department under a special Minister. We therefore recommend the preparation in time of peace of an administrative organisation with this in view, and in particular the immediate institution of a revised administrative organisation which would include not only the existing Headquarters staff in London, but the formation of 13 areas outside London corresponding approximately with the Civil Commissioners&apos; Areas in England and Wales and with groups of Civil Emergency Areas in Scotland  each with its own Headquarters staff. This change is necessary in peace time for the purpose of the effective examination of local authority schemes, and in war a regional system of administration will be an essential element in the war-time organisation.Conclusions and Recommendations.33. Our Conclusions and recommendations may be summarised as follows : (a) That as regards the nature, scale and distribution of Air Raid Precautions Services, including hospital and fire brigade services (1) The aim of Air Raid Precautions is  (a) To maintain the morale of the people;(&amp;) To ensure the continued functioning of the activities which are vital to the effective prosecution of the war and to the life of the community;(c) To reduce to a minimum the destruction of life and property likely to be produced by air raids(paragraph 5).(2) We take the view that passive defence measures must be considered pari passu a,nd correlated with all the other war activities of the country as a whole, in order that due weight may be given to the order of priority which should be accorded to our various defence measures. In this connection we have been informed that the man-power requirements for air raid precautions have been estimated at 1,398,500 (of which less than 200,000 need to be men of under 40 years of age), and that these requirements are being considered by the Man Power Sub-Committee, with a view to adjusting the balance between them and the claims of active defence and of industry (paragraphs 6, 7 and 19).(3) We have proceeded on the estimate of the Air Staff that the scale of enemy attack may be over 600 tons of bombs per diem. While it is arguable that this scale of attack may not be sustainable for a long period against such of our most vulnerable centres as are provided with the strongest defences, it must be remembered that the volume of attack in the early weeks of war may be far greater than this figure, and it is essential that the scale of air raid precautions should be sufficient to ensure against the collapse of morale or of vital services in the initial period, when the attack is likely to be at its heaviest (paragraphs 8-10).(4) We consider that the problem of the evacuation of the population, especially from the London area, at the onset of emergency has an important bearing not only on air raid precautions but also on other war preparations. We are advised that the problem is under intensive consideration by the Air Raid Precautions Department (paragraph 11).(5) The general scheme of air raid precautions should be based on some such principle of grading of risks as has already been prepared by the Air Raid Precautions Department, taking into account the comparative liability of localities to attack and their comparative value as targets (paragraphs 15 and 16).(6) We recommend that the proposals set out in Classes &quot; A &quot; to &quot;E &quot; in Part III of the Home Office Memorandum of the 23rd March, 1937, on the Financial Aspects of Air Raid Precautions (Paper No, D.P.R. 181) and repro-duced as Appendix I, should be accepted in principle as representing the scale of effort involved1 in the present Deficiency Programme of the Air Raid Precau-tions Department. The total expenditure under these heads, to be met from Exchequer and/or local government funds, is estimated at  12,725,000 capital plus  1,300,000 annually (paragraph 17 and Footnote on page 6).
(7) We have not dealt with the following additional measures of Air Raid Precautions Services :  (i) Base Hospitals.(ii) Vital Services (Electricity, Water, Gas, &amp;c).(iii) Protection against the effects of blast and splinters from high explosive bombs.(iv) Structural alterations to buildings. (paragraph 20.)(i) Base Hospitals.We consider that the Base Hospital problem should be treated on a national basis and we recommend that the measures necessary for the treatment of civilian air casualties in Base Hospitals should be re-examined on the arbitrary basis of a present estimated deficiency of 87,000 beds for which the necessary buildings already exist; and that requirements in excess of these should be met by a scheme of improvisation. At our request a special Sub-Committee has been set up by the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence for this purpose (paragraph 20 (i)).(ii) Vital Services (Electricity, Water, Gas, &amp;c).A special Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence has been set up to consider this problem. The provisional estimate of cost to the Exchequer given in Paper No. D.P.R. 181 was  5 million (paragraph 20 (ii)).(iii) Protection against the effects of Blast and Splinters from high explosive bombs.The Defence Policy and Requirements Committee at their Meeting held on the 24th June agreed that the accumulation of the proposed reserve of 500 million sandbags should be spread over a period of six years and authorised, as an interim measure, the purchase of a six months&apos; quota of sandbags on this basis, i.e., 42 million approximately, or such lesser quantity as the industry could provide in the normal course. The estimated cost of providing the complete reserve of 500 million sandbags is  5 million (paragraph 20 (iii)).(iv) Structural alterations to buildings.We consider that the proposals for the structural alteration of new dwellings in public housing schemes, at the estimated cost of  60 per house, must be subordinated to the primary consideration that these houses should be available at a reasonable rent, and we therefore recommend that no public announcement should be made regarding such structural alterations, though advice and encouragement should be given to those willing to make such provision at their own expense (paragraph 20 (iv)).(b) That as regards the distribution of responsibility between Central and Local Authorities and voluntary organisations r(8) The Ministerial responsibility for the control and organisation of Air Raid Precaution Services should continue to rest with the Home Secretary in time of peace (paragraph 27).(9) The scope of the responsibilities of the Central and the Local Authorities respectively should be defined in the manner suggested in Appendix II to this Report, subject to any necessary adjustments with regard to emergency Fire Brigade measures (paragraphs 21-23).(10) In time of peace work in connection with the preparation of local schemes must primarily be the responsibility of Local Authorities, subject to advice and guidance by the Home Office organisation. Legislation defining the powers and duties of the Central and Local Authorities, and authorising expenditure on these schemes, will be necessary (paragraph 21).(11) These local schemes should be subject to examination by the Central authority on the basis of the general primuples referred to in paragraph 15 above, and Exchequer grants should be made /ihaioSof such schemes only so far as they are approved by the Central authority (paragraphs 22 and 25).(12) We consider that the services of voluntary organisations might be usefully enlisted in aid of Air Raid Precautions, provided that such organisations (i) act in close co-operation with, but under, the local authorities;(ii) in no way detract from the proper responsibilities of local authorities as already denned; [15492] c .2
(iii) are financially self-supporting; and(iv) are non-political and embrace every section of the community. This matter is now being considered by the Home Secretary (paragraph 26).(c) That as regards the necessary adjustment of present Departmental responsi-bility and organisation resulting from the growth and development of A ir Raid Precautions  (13) It will be necessary to establish a system of co-ordination which will ensure not only the translation of decided policy into action upon an agreed and concerted plan of administration, but also, as an essential pre-requisite, agreement on policy itself, and on any pdblic announcement in connection therewith.   &quot;We therefore recommend (i) that questions of major policy, as well as of appeals on policy resultingfrom Departmental differences of opinion, should be referred to the Sub-Committee on Defence Policy and Requirements, all Ministers concerned attending as Members of that Committee with the object of representing the views of their respective Departments.(ii) that, in addition to the normal methods of consultation, co-co-ordination between the various Departments in time of peace should be facilitated by a Joint Standing Inter-Departmental Committee, and that the Members of this Committee should be of sufficient rank to ensure executive effect being given to decided policy. This Committee will include members from all the Departments concerned in, or affected by air raid precautions, and from the Committee of Imperial Defence, which will, in addition, provide a Joint Secretary(paragraphs 28 and 29).(14) We recommend that financial provision from the Exchequer for Air Raid Precautions Services in England and Wales, including provision for fire brigade services, should be shown in a single Air Raid Precautions &quot;Vote, subject, however, to the following reservations :-(i) Expenditure on buildings and stationery provided by the Office of works and the Stationery Office will be borne on the Votes of those Depart-ments, particulars of such expenditure being given in the usual state-ment as to Allied Services.(ii) Expenditure attributable to Air Raid Precautions, e.g., in respect of schools or Police buildings, which would qualify for grant under an already existing scheme, should be included in the Estimates of the Department or Service concerned (paragraph 30).(15) We have given special consideration to the particular case of Air Raid Precautions Services in Scotland, and our recommendations under this heading will be found above in paragraph 31 of the main body of the Report.(16) In time of war it will be necessary for the Central Authority to assume a greater measure of control, and it may well prove necessary to place the Air Raid Precautions Department under a special Minister (paragraph 32).(17) We recommend, in the light of the growth and development of Air Raid Precautions, and of the additional responsibilities and work which will fall on the Central Authority charged with the general direction and supervision of work throughout the country, that the Air Raid Precautions Department should be substantially strengthened and that arrangements should be made for the institution of regional staffs throughout the country (paragraph 32).Signed on behalf of the Sub-Committee:N.
