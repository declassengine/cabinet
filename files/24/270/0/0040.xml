At.their Meeting on 5th.

In the last few years and by differing methodsprovision has been made for the needs of a number of the many industries of which agriculture is composed.      While methods have varied,   the policy has been the same,  namely, the assurance of maximum supplies to the consumer consistent with a reasonable remuneration for the producer.      Briefly, the following are the more important measures already taken. Meat.    It has been possible to maintain asatisfactory market for mutton   and lamb by quantitative regulation of imports, The Livestock Industry Bill provides a long term policy for continuing beef production.-1-
Cereals.    The new proposals for oats and barley, added to the Wheat Scheme, provide a policy for cereals which will keep the plough going sufficiently to preserve a balance of agriculture.    These schemes are an insurance against loss rather than an assurance of profits.Sugar.Beet.    The position of sugar beet, animportant arable crop,   has been settled by the Sugar Industry (Reorganisation) Act of 1936 with a considerable saving to the Exchequer.      Schemes for potatoesund hops are working satisfactorily.    Horticultural products are dealt with under general and seasonal tariffs.3, The problems of the dairying industry, the baconindustry, and the poultry industry remain to be dealt wit-h. In the time available it has only been possible for the Committee to give careful consideration to milk and.bacon.      Consideration of the problems of the&quot;&apos;poultry1 industry will be taken up by the Committee after the-Recess.Milk Policy.4. The recommendations of the Committee on thesubject of the Governments long term milk policy are set out in the attached draft White Paper entitled &quot;Statement on Milk Policy&quot; (Appendix I) which, subject to the approval of the Cabinet, it is proposed to lay before Parliament before the adjournment.
5. As will &quot;be seen from pages 5,6 and 7 of Appendix I,the amount of the Exchequer contributions proposed towards the premiums on T. To Milk and tillk from Attested Herds is still under discussion between the Chancellor of tho Exchequer and the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries. Moreover the application of the Milk Policy proposals to Northern Ireland is also under consideration.      The Cabinet will be informed as to the position in regard to these two matters at the Meeting on Wednesday, July 28th.Bacon.6. The conclusions reached by the Committee in regard tbacon are set out in the attached draft Answer to a Private Notice Question (Appendix II) which, if the Cabinet approve it is proposed to give in the House of Commons before the adjournment.7.. The Committee accordingly recoinmend the Cabinet  :(l) To approve, subject to the settlement of the outstanding questions mentioned in paragraph 5 above, the lone- term milk policy outlined in the draft.White Paper (Appendix I to this Report) and to autnorise the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries to arrange for copies of the White Paper,in the form approved by the Cabinet,to be available in the Vote Office on Thursday,  July 29th.(2) To approve the bacon policy indicated in the draft Answer to the Private Notice Question (Appendix II to this Report) and to authorise the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries to give this Answer in the House of Commons on Thursday, July 29th.Signed on behalf of the CommitteeNEVILLE CHAMBERLAIN, Chairman.Whitehall Gardens, S.

APPENDIX I.CABINET. COMMITTEE ON AGRICULTURAL POLICY. STATEMENT ON MILK POLICY. DRAFT ./IIITE PAPER.1, The Government have carefully considered theposition of the dairying industry from the points of viewof producers ana consumers and of the commercial interests involved.     They have had before them the Report of there organisation Commission for Milk, other authoritativeReports bearing on the industry and also the views of representative organisations, all of which have been ofthe greatest assistance.      They have also taken intoconsideration the recent outcome of the application made,on behalf of milk producers, to the Import Duties AdvisoryxCommittee, for increased duties on butter and cheese.2. The Government desire to see the dairying industry of this country self-supporting and profitable, and it is with this object in view, and in order to bring to full achievement the efforts that dairy farmers have them-selves been making to improve the quality of their product, that they propose to invite Parliament to provide addition-al Exchequer assistance on the lines set out below.    The Governments policy for this industry, as for other branches of agriculture, is to ensure the maximum supplies for the consumer at fair prices consistent withfootnote reference to be given to I.D.A.0. Parliamentary question?-1-
reasonable remuneration for the producer.      They believe that the only sure foundation for the prosperity of the industry is an increased consumption of liquid milk. An essential step towards this objective is to establish public confidence in the cleanliness and purity of the milk supply and thereby to quicken demand for what is one of the most valuable of human foods.3. The Government also propose to continue and extend their policy of promoting the increased consumption of milk among those sections of the population for whom it is of particular&quot; value.4, v/ith the approval of Parliament,  the dairy farmersof Great Britain a few years ago set up Milk Marketing 3oards under the Agricultural Marketing Acts.      In this way, they were able to cope with a price situation that had been steadily growing unstable and to avert a collapse which would have spread disaster through the co-urLtrystde.5. The industry, thus enabled by Parliament to attackits internal problems, was further assisted by a temporary Act called the Milk Act, 1964,  the main provisions of which expired in 1956, which had a three-fold object, (i) to supplement the low receipts of the Milk Marketing Boards from the sale of milk for manufacture,  (ii) to increase the consumption of liquid milk and (iii) to promote a purer milk supply.      The first was of an emergency nature;    the second and. third indicated the lines of future policy.      This measure has been extended once, and by the Milk (Amendment )^ill7of this Session, it is proposed to extend the main provisions for a further period until 30th September, 1938.
6. It is still desirable to safeguard the industryagainst emergency conditions, but circumstances have altered to an extent that now enables the Government to lay relatively greater emphasis on measures designed to promote the increased consumption of liquid milk and the provision of a purer milk supply,7. Under the Milk Act, 1954,  the receipts of the milk Marketing Boards from manufacturing milk were supplemented by a system of repayable Exchequer advances based on standard prices per gallon of milk used for manufacture *      The Government now propose to safeguard the industry against the effect of any serious fall in the prices of butter and cheese below current levels, by means of a price-insurance plan under which Exchequer assistance will be payable, on a prescribed scale, to the Boards in respect of standard gallonages of milk used in factories for butter and cheese, and milk made into cheese on farms,  in the event of the average prices of imported butter and cheese falling, over a period, below 100/- and 56/- per cwt.  respectively.        The present average prices of imported butter and cheese are of the order of 110/- and 72/- per cwt, respectively. The corresponding prices in February, 1934, when the Milk Act proposals were announced, were 7l/6d. and. 47/6d. per cwt.  respectively.
8, The advances to the Milk Marketing Boards ofGreat Britain under the Milk Act,  1954, and subsequent legislation,  involve the board^ds in a contingent liability-ity during a period ending 30th September, 1940,  to repay to the Exchequer an amount estimated at over  3,400,000.      This liability only arises if cheese or butter prices rise to a certain level, and. it is anticipated that the repayments which will have accrued, by the 1st. October, 1937, will amount to approximately  150,000,      it is proposed, to release the Milk Boards from any balance of this liability accruing after the 30th September,  1937.9. In order to give the necessary momentum to theproduction of quality milks in Great Britain,  the Government propose that Exchequer contributions should be made at diminishing rates,  for a period of five years towards the additional costs incurred in the production of milk of the Accredited standard, milk of the Tuber-culin Tested standard, ano milk from Attested Herds. This assistance will be partly in the form of quality premiums additional to those now receivable by producers but they will also be,  in part, in relief of the contribution towards quality premiums which all producers in England, ana ,/ales make today under the Milk Marketing Scheme,
10,       The premium on Accredited milk sold by wholesale now payable from the pool funds of the Milk Marketing Board in England and Wales is at the rate of Id. a gallonj the whole cost of which is borne by the pool;    it is proposed that, for a period of five years from 1st October, 1958, this should be increased to l^do a gallon, of which the Exchequer contribution would be fd. for each of the first two years, ^d0 for each of the third and fourth years and 4;d, for the fifth year, the balance each year to be borne by the poolD     The proposed rate of premium of l^d. per gallon should encourage a large and increasing number of producers to take up the production of milk of this standard,,x   11.       As provided in the amendments of the English milk marketing Scheme which Parliament has recently approved, the Milk Marketing Board will pay a special quality premium of Id. a gallon on sales of Tuberculin Tested milk sold by wholesale, which will no longer be exempt from the Scheme;    the Government propose that the Exchequer should contribute ^da towards this premium for each of the first two yearse     For each of the third, fourth and fifth years, it is proposed that the Exchequer shall contribute ^d, a gallon and that the premium shall not be less than ^fd. a gallon^st   12.       Under the Agriculture ^ill/of this Session, financial assistance is provided to encourage the eradication of bovine tuberculosis    by means of the Attested Herd Scheme.    This assists ance includes an Exchequer payment of Id. a gallon on milk from Attested Herds, the Milk Boards being under a contingent obliga-tion to assume this liability in due course.      In order to accelerate the flow of pure milk under that Scheme, it is proposethatfor each of the first two years,/the premium on sales by wholesal* ,/fTOTE - The amount of the Exchequer contributions proposed towards the premiums on T(To Milk and Milk from Attested Her&amp;s is still under discussion between the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries^-5-
t year d year d year h year h year should be increased to 2d. a gallon, of which the Exchequer would contribute l^d. and the pool would be r required to contribute -g-d, as soon as these proposals came into force.     For each of the third, fourth and fifth years, it is proposed that the premium that the Boards shall be required to pay shall not be less than lfd. a gallon towards which the Exchequer will contribute/l^d^a gallon.     In view of these new liabilities, it is proposed to release the Boards from the contingent obligation mentioned above,13,       The. following Table shows the rates of premium which the Boards will be required to pay in respect of the various cate-gories of quality milks and the Exchequer contributions thereto:Accredited Milk.

The position of producer-retailers in England and &quot;wales has been improved by the recent amendments to the milk marketing Scheme which have had the effect of placing their contributions on a new basis.     In view of this, some modifica-tion of these proposals will be proposed in their case.15.       It is proposed to make corresponding provisions in relation to the production of quality milks in Scotland, but certain ad-justiaents may be necessary to meet the special Scottish conditions.16.       The Committee on Animal Diseases of the Economic Advisory Council recommended that the introduction of some measure of compulsory pasteurisation should no longer be deferred and the Government propose that, subject to certain conditions, any Local Authority shall be enabled to apply to the Minister of Health, or the Secretary of State for Scotland, for an Order making compulsory the efficient pasteurisation of milk sold by retail in its area.     These conditions are that no such Order shall come into operation within two years after it is made, that milk from tuberculin tested herds, and Sterilised Milk shall be exempt from its scope and that milk retailed from dairies where the milk is derived from a single herd shall be exempt for three years fi om the date of operation of the Order,17,       The Reorganisation Commission for Milk, and other bodies that have examined the problem of milk distribution in recent years, have expressed the view that the present methods of distributing milk are, in many respects, capable of improvement-.     This appears to be generally accepted by those who speak on behalf of the distributive trade, Accordingly, the Government propose, in the legislation that
will &quot;be necessary to carry out the present proposals, to include provisions to facilitate the improved organisation of   the distributive service.18.       It is proposed also to adopt the machinery of service schemes on the lines of those for which provision is made in the Livestock Industry Act of the present Session of Parliament, so as to enable the various sections of the industry to finance co-operatively services of common interest.19.       The Government propose that a permanent Milk Commission should be set up to keep under review the production, marketing and consumption of milk (including the effect of prices on demand) and to be of general assistance to the industry and to the Ministers concerned.      The primary duties of the Commission will be concerned with the improvement of milk distribution and with conciliation and arbitration between the Milk Marketing Boards and the milk buyers in business matters.     Apart from this, it is not proposed to disturb the existing arrangements for the negotiation of contract terms and prices or the public safeguards provided, under statute, by the Consumers1 Committees and the Committees of Investigation.      The Government propose, however, to take steps to enable the views of consumers to be made available to the Milk Marketing Boards at an early stage in the contract negotiations.The Commission will be required to present an annual report for submission to Parliament.20.       The Government regard the continuance of the scheme for the provision of cheap milk for school children as an essential feature of their proposals and they are confident
that in this matter the co-operation of the industry..will,,, as at present, he forthcoming.      This scheme has now proved its merits.     It has resulted in a large increase in the consumption of milk in schools, and in making arrangements for its continuance the Government will consider the need for minor modifications to meet difficulties which have arisen in its administration.21.       The Government attach not less importance to an increased consumption of milk hy expectant and nursing mothers, and children under school age, and they will &quot;bring forward proposals for securing, in co-operation with the industry, a reduction in the price of liquid milk to local authorities for the purpose of their maternity and child welfare arrangements.     Local authorities will thus he in a position to extend their present schemes under which milk is made available either free or at a reduced price as circumstances may require.22%       The Government commend the proposals as a whole as a policy which will provide for the dairying industry a basis for an increasing sale of milk in the liquid market, will secure   cheap milk for those classes of consumers to whom it will be of particular value and will provide for consumers generally a permanent improvement in the cleanliness and purity of the milk supply.      The proposals will lead to a reduction in the cost of milk production and distribution and to the enhancement of technical efficiency, and they will be a notable step towards the ultimate objective which must be to ensure that only clean and pure milk is offered for   -sale for liquid consumption.Legislation to give effect to these proposals will be introduced as early as practicable next Session.
/&quot;&quot;n*B. The application of these proposals to Northern Ireland has yet to be considered.^26th July, 1937.23.       The Ministers concerned have deferred consideration of a scheme? submitted under the Agricultural Marketing Acts, for regulating the marketing of milk productso Subject, to the wishes of the promoters in the light of these proposals, the Ministers concerned will be prepared to give this scheme further consideration,24.       ^Paragraph giving estimated total cost to be addedlater* .J7
APPENDIX II. BACON.DRAFT ANSWER TO PARLIAMEHTARY ^U. .3TION.The Government have given careful consideration to the difficulties of the bacon industry which appear to be attributable,  in part,  to the increase of pig-feeding costs&apos; and, in part,  to the high costs of bacon manufacture in this country.    They believe that if the industry were founded on a small number of efficient factories provided with adequate and regular supplies of pigs of good quality and conformations  sufficient economies could be secured   in the cost of curing to enable the industry to be maintained during periods of high feeding costs.The Government accordingly would be willing to propose that a moderate degree of assistance should be accorded to the industry over a sufficient period to enable the contract system for the supply of bacon pigs to be re-established if they were assured that the reorganisation of the bacon factories v/ould so proceed as to hold promise of reduction in curing costs which would enable both producers and curers to work at a profit.      The Government desire to give further consideration,  in consultation with the industry, to the nature of the enabling powers that would be required and the form which they should take, and with a view to laying detailed proposals before Parliament next SessionoMeanwhile the present arrangements for the regulation of imports will continue in force.
