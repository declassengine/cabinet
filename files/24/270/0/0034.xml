Printed for the Committee of Imperial Defence.   July 1937.SECRET. Copy No.   4:4:COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.Extract from the Minutes of the 297tk Meeting, held on July 15, 1937..    (6) ANGLO-PORTUGUESE RELATIONS.(Previous reference C.I.D. 292nd Meeting, Minute 4.)(C.I.D. Papers Nos. 1320-B and 1336-B.)THE COMMITTEE had under consideration a letter from the Foreign Office on Anglo-Portuguese Relations (C.I.D. Paper No. 1320-B) and a Report by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee on the strategical aspects involved in our relations with Portugal (C.I.D. Paper No. 1336-B).LORD CHATFIELD, introducing the Report at the request of the Chairman, said that the conclusions reached by the Chiefs of Staff on the importance of Anglo-Portuguese relations from the strategical point of view were set out in paragraphs 12 and 13 of their Report. The arguments upon which this conclusion had been based were set out in paragraphs 2 and 3 of the Report.i There were, however, certain additional comments which the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee wished to put forward, although they lay rather outside the scope of their Report. A proposal had been made, in C.I.D. Paper No. 1320-B, that it might be advisable for us to send a military mission to Portugal. As to this, the Chiefs of Staff wished to emphasise that any such mission would be empty-handed, so far as the provision of British war material for the land forces is concerned. The most they could do would be to advise on questions of organisa-tion and equipment, and perhaps to persuade the Portuguese Government to place the orders, which we could not ourselves fulfil, in countries friendly to us. The Navy had already rendered considerable assistance to Portugal, having built no less than 17 ships for her since the war; this had been gratefully acknowledged, and there was probably not much more that could be done in that direction. The Air Force would not be able to render more than token assistance within the next twelve months, though subsequently more might be done.&quot; A recent report from our Naval Attache in Paris, who was also accredited to Lisbon, had indicated that Portugal was now turning to Germany for assistance in building up her fleet. For instance, two sloops recently built by Messrs. Yarrow had been fitted with German engines. A new arsenal which, was being built in Portugal was largely equipped by Germany, although part of the machinery was British. The Naval Attache had added a comment that in his view there would be great value if long-distance flights could be undertaken by British aircraft, as these would have the effect of impressing the Portuguese.SIR EDWARD ELLINGTON said that after the bombing of the Deutschland a flight had been made by British flying-boats direct from England to Gibraltar.; LORD SWINTON added that the Air Ministry hoped shortly to arrange for experimental flights down the west coast of Africa.SIR SAMUEL HOARE suggested that the despatch of a British military mission to Portugal would be well worth while.  Even though they were more or [15617-2]
less empty-handed,, they would establish useful contacts and gain, influence. Further, might we not encourage Portugal to place orders for naval vessels in this country.?       .   ... ,.LORD CHATFIELD remarked that it was&apos; unlikely that Portugal would have., any money available for more ships. They, now wanted artillery and aeroplanes.      &apos; .. .  ^ --        .        - .SIR ROBERT VANSITTART remarked that when this question was previously considered by the Committee of Imperial Defence in April 1937, one of the recommendations had been that, as regards the despatch of a British military mission, the Foreign Office should &quot;temporise encouragingly without undertaking any definite commitment.&quot; In discussing this question with the Portuguese Ambassador, the above instructions had been carried out to the best of his ability, but he now felt that it was desirable to advance a step further, particularly having regard to the fact that Italy and Germany were now carrying-out intensive propaganda in Portugal. If it was not possible to send a military mission, would it be possible to do anything else in the way of collaboration with Portugal? The Portuguese Ambassador had informed the Foreign Office that it was the practice for Portuguese Officers to be attached to French regiments. Would similar attachments to the British Army be possible ? Or, again, would it be possible for us to send Naval, Military and Air Attaches to Portugal ?SIR CYRIL DEVERELL, replying to a question by Lord Swinton, said that Portugal had asked for complete artillery equipment for 4 Divisions and Corps and Army Troops. This was, of course, an impossible demand, but it would be a mistake to imagine that we had done nothing to help them. In February 1937 Messrs. Vickers-Armstrong had been authorised to supply to Portugal the following ammunition: 12,000 rounds of 4-5-inch ammunition and 4,000 rounds of 75-mm. ammunition, and also certain ammunition for naval guns. In April 1937 Messrs. Vickers had been asked by the Portuguese Government if they could supply 29 75-mm. A.A. guns, 7 predictors, 7 height-finders, 8,700 rounds of 75-mm. ammunition and 28 gun tractors for the anti-aircraft guns. The Admiralty and Air Ministry had foregone certain items of their rearmament programme in order to provide a portion of the above order. He (Sir Cyril Deverell) wished to make it clear that, if a military mission were sent, it could only act in an advisory capacity and would not be in a position to offer any equipment to the Portuguese.LORD SWINTON was of the opinion that a military mission would be of real value, even if it were only able to advise the Portuguese what equipment they should have, and the most suitable sources for obtaining it, if we ourselves were unable to undertake supply. It might, moreover, be possible to fit in certain of Portugal &apos;s requirements with those of our own, and thereby to get the Portuguese interested in our equipment.LORD HALIFAX suggested that it was of the greatest importance that we should combat,the impression which the Portuguese had gained that Great Britain no longer took any interest in Portuguese affairs.SIR ROBERT VANSITTART agreed, and added that we should use every endeavour to dispel the idea in the minds of the Portuguese that we regarded them as a class &quot; C&quot; nation.SIR CYRIL DEVERELL said that, as regards the appointment of a military attache to Portugal, the War Office simply could not afford it. There were other countries, at present without attaches, which in the view of the War Office had a prior claim to Portugal. A proposal to have an attache&quot; representing all three Services had been examined and deemed impracticable.SIR ROBERT VANSITTART observed that we had an Ambassador in Lisbon,; despite the prior claims of other countries, to such representation.SIR SAMUEL HOARE suggested, that, taking a long view, it was most important that..-we;&apos;slibuld\&apos;keep ^ortugal-withiri^our. -orbit,- The German trade figures with&quot; Portugal were most significant in this respect; and it was to be feared that, once markets with Portugal had been lost, it would be impossible to recover them.  -
SIR THOMAS INSKIP said that he was impressed by the argument that, it was important to keep the alliance with Portugal not only in our own strategical interests, but also in order to keep other nations from gaining strategical advantages in Portuguese territory. . , .; &apos; A ; &apos; .SIR JOHN SIMON observed that the Committee had considered this question at some length at their meeting held on the 15th April, 1937* The first conclusion reached at that meeting had been as follows : :.&apos; -- &apos;.      &apos;   &apos;7-&quot;Thatit is open to question whether it would be advisable at the present time to send a British Military Mission to Portugal. On the one hand, the Anglo-Portuguese Alliance is.of considerable value from the strategic point of view, and it is very important that the attempts which are being made to alienate her from this country should be combated. On the other hand, it is impossible at present to supply Portugal -with the armaments which she . needs owing to the requirements of our own rearmament programme and of other foreign countries which have prior claims upon us in this matter. A British Military Mission would therefore be empty-handed. Moreover, in view of the existing situation in the Iberian Peninsula, it is doubtful whether, from the point of view of wider political considerations, the present is an appropriate moment for any military activity on our part in Portugal.&quot;SIR SAMUEL HO ARE suggested that the report by the Chiefs of Staff, which had been rendered as a result of the Meeting in question, put an entirely, new complexion on the matter.LORD SWLNTON said that Turkey had become closely linked with us with regard to her air policy as a result of encouragement which she had received from our representatives in Turkey. :;    ;!        &apos;THE CHAIRMAN said that when the question of sending a. military mission to Portugal had been discussed by the Committee three months ago, they had come very near to recommending it. He was inclined to think that, having regard to the report by the Chiefs of Staff, they should now go a step further.SIR JOHN- SIMON agreed that the report by the Chiefs of Staff had brought out the primary importance of maintaining the alliance, and in addition of ensuring that Portugal did not become too closely identified with some other country. Even if Portuguese intervention in the last war had not been particularly effective, it would not necessarily follow that this would be the case in the future. The Portuguese were easily impressed by gestures, and in this connection it would be recalled that, when a British Court decreed that Messrs. Waterlow should pay a million pounds damages to a Portuguese bank, this had had an astounding effect upon Portuguese public opinion in our favour and greatly increased our prestige.SIR ROBERT VANSITTART said that at the present moment the Portuguese Ambassador might possibly decline the offer of a military mission owing to German and Italian influence. In that event, it might be necessary for us to fall back upon some alternative proposal such as the appointment of attaches to Lisbon.THE CHAIRMAN thought that the first approach should be confined to the question of a military mission. The alternative proposal could be considered if the military mission proved unacceptable. &apos;-conclusions.The Committee of Imperial Defence agreed  -7(a) To endorse the conclusions of the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee in regard to the importance of Anglo-Portuguese relations from.the strategical-point of view, namely : &quot;We conclude that the importance of maintaining our.&apos;alliance. .  .    with Portugal has increased with the development of air power, owing&quot;&quot;, to the fact that, from the air point of view, the Mother Country andC.I.D. 292nd Meeting, Minute 4.
her Island possessions in the Eastern Atlantic are admirably situated either for the defence of or attack on our seaborne trade.We cannot forecast the outcome of the Spanish civil war, but since a return to the old and innocuous regime appears unlikely, it may well be that the availability of facilities and anchorages in Portuguese waters, alternative to Gibraltar, will prove of greater value to our navy in the future than in the past.Elsewhere, in Africa and the Far East, it is important that no strong Foreign Power should be permitted to develop a predominant influence in Portuguese territory.From every aspect, therefore, we confirm the view that the main-tenance of our alliance with Portugal is of great importance.&quot;(6) That, having regard to conclusion (a) above and to the importance of counteracting the growing influence of Germany and Italy on Portugal, the despatch of a British military mission would, on political grounds, be desirable.     ...(c) In view of .(&apos;&amp;) above, to recommend to the Cabinet that the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should have authority to sound the portuguese-guese Government as to whether they would welcome the despatch of a military mission to Portugal.m. jfc Jt.

Q1320-B. 1 1 committee OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.ANGLO-PORTUGUESE RELATIONS.Copy of a letter from the Foreign Office to the Secretary, Committee of ImperialDefence.[W 4669/25/36]Sir, Foreign Office, April 6, 1937.I AM directed by Mr. Secretary Eden to request you to 1&apos;ay before the Committee of Imperial Defence the accompanying copies of two despatches* which have been addressed to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Lisbon regarding the general question of Anglo-Portuguese relations.2. Mr. Eden has been seriously considering the request made by the Portiir guese Ambassador that a military mission should be sent to Portugal to study the problem of national defence and offer the Portuguese Government the benefit of their advice and recommendations. He feels that, setting aside for the moment the question of whether such a mission could, in fact, be suggested without an express request froni the Portuguese Government, this proposal merits the close attention of the Committee of Imperial Defence, and he would accordingly be grateful for any observations which they may care to make in this connexion.3. The Committee of Imperial Defence will recall that the question of the obligations of His Majesty&apos;s Government under the Anglo-Portuguese Treaties of Alliance has frequently been discussed in the past. The general conclusion which has been reached is that His Majesty&apos;s Government, while admitting that they are under a general obligation to assist Portugal against her enemies, reserve to themselves the right of judging the circumstances under which the assistance will be given or withheld. Apart from the Treaty position, however, it is generally admitted that the Portuguese Alliance was of considerable value to His Majesty&apos;s Government during the Great War, and would probably continue to be so in any future war.4. It is difficult to conceive circumstances which would bring about the termination of the Alliance which has now continued uninterrupted for over five centuries, and there are, indeed, signs of a strong disposition on the part of Portugal to set an increased value upon that Alliance and to welcome any steps that may be taken to bring about a more intimate collaboration between the two countries. Mr. Eden is convinced, however, that the advantages to be gained from this tendency are in danger of being compromised unless His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment are prepared to afford Portugal more consideration and substantial assistance than at present, particularly since the Portuguese Government are fully aware of the attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government to the obligations under the Alliance, as set out above.5. Mr. Eden fully realises that the completion of their own rearmament programme must be the prime consideration of His Majesty&apos;s Government, and that there are, consequently, great difficulties in the way of supplying Portugal&apos;s armament requirements. These difficulties have been fully and frankly explained to the Portuguese Government, but it is clear that the latter are not satisfied that His Majesty&apos;s Government have met their overtures in the accommodating spirit called for by the Alliance.* Enclosures A and B. [14979] b
6. While in normal times, it might be maintained that a somewhat passive attitude towards Portugal would satisfy the requirements of His Majesty&apos;s Government and could not excite any reasonable opposition from that country, it is doubtful whether the same can be said of the present situation, with the grave disturbances which are taking place in the Iberian Peninsula. Whatever the outcome of the present Civil War, it is considered that Portugal, with her strategic position, will continue to be of great, if not of increased importance, and that any attempt to alienate her from this country should be combated. Mr. Eden views the German propaganda which is being carried on in Portugal with some concern, and.it is a factor which His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot afford to neglect. Since British propaganda on the same lines does not exist, some other method must, therefore, be found of redressing the balance.7. It would appear that M. Monteiro&apos;s suggestion that His Majesty&apos;s Government should co-operate more closely than heretofore in the organisation of Portuguese defence, provides His Majesty&apos;s Government with an opportunity of satisfying Portuguese desires in a manner which will not run counter to their essential policy of national rearmament. It would, at the same time, provide an occasion for a detailed review of the strategic importance of Portugal, and of the value to this country of the possible co-operation in a future war of the Portuguese armed forces, besides securing to this country a predominant position in the military plans of a country which, if it does not obtain the material which it requires in this country, will no doubt turn elsewhere, with a correspondingly disadvantageous effect upon the interests of His Majesty&apos;s Government.8. In addition to the question of the despatch of a British military mission to Portugal, Mr. Eden will be glad to learn the views of the Committee of Imperial Defence as. to whether there is any advantage from the strategical point of view to be foreseen in the acceptance of the Portuguese Governments invitation for His Majesty&apos;s&apos;Government to co-operate more closely with them, and to tender advice on matters affecting the defence interests of the two countries. \ I am, &amp;c.(Signed)      D .

ENCLOSURE A.Copy of a despatch from the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassador, Lisbon.[W 5350/7/41] (No. 101.)Sir, Foreign Office, March 16, 1937.I ASKED the Portuguese Ambassador to come and see me this morning, when I told him that the conversation which I hoped we would now have together was but an indication of that closer collaboration between our two countries which we were anxious to bring about. I had now had an opportunity for a careful study of the letter which the Portuguese Prime Minister, Dr. Salazar, had addressed to your Excellency. As a consequence, I would like to give the Ambassador a message for Dr. Salazar as an attempt further to clarify our attitude to the Spanish civil war. We fully appreciated that it was inevitable that Portugal&apos;s special geographical position should influence her outlook, but we were none the less anxious to respond to the Portuguese Prime Ministers request and once more to seek to make plain our own position. We had sought from the outset to do all in our power to limit the conflict to Spain itself. We had done this both in the interests of Europe and, we were convinced, in the interests of Spain. It was indispensable to prevent the conflagration from spreading, and it was highly desirable to limit foreign intervention. Our own conviction was unaltered that if there had been no foreign intervention in Spain in this civil conflict it would have been much happier for that country. I would not conceal from the Ambassador that there would have been more sympathy for General Franco&apos;s point of view in this country if he had not.sought the aid of Italian and German nationals. However that might be, we were confident that at the outcome it should be possible for this country to be on good terms with whatever Government was established in Spain, the more so since this country had lent no active aid to either side except on purely humanitarian grounds.2.   The Ambassador thanked me for my explanation and added that he himself had been convinced from the first that General Franco would win.   He was none the less certain that it was a European interest that he should do so. In Portugal, where Spain was very well known, that country was never described as one entity.  For them it was &quot; The Spains.&quot;  It was important to realise the divisions of race which existed in the country. Those in the south were of Moorish descent. In the north, of Gothic descent; in the north-east in Catalonia, of Celtic descent; while in the centre the proud Castillian people were an amalgam of all three.   Consequently the danger in Spain was one of disintegration.   He used the word danger because if Spain were to disintegrate, then the problem of Spanish Morocco and the Balearic Islands would become acute.  General Franco, he was convinced, Would never cede any territory.   In Spain the danger was not communism, which was wholly alien to- the Spanish character, and which in any event was a form of government.   The danger there was anarchy.   In these conditions the Ambassador was somewhat puzzled as to why the Italians had gone so far in their help of General Franco.   He could not believe it was only to prevent the establishment of a Red republic in Spain.   Maybe they were genuinely fearful of Russian influence in that peninsula.  Whatever their motive, Dr. Monteiro made it clear from his subsequent remarks that he did not attach any great importance to Italian influence in the Iberian Peninsula, but he was apprehensive of the effect&quot; of German propaganda in Portugal, which he described to me as being on a very large scale.  Almost every sphere, cultural, journalistic and sport, was affected.  Facilities were being given for Portuguese students to visit Germany. He was anxious that they should visit this country also.  He was also anxious that in those sports in which Portugal excelled she should compete in this country.   He mentioned particularly horsemanship, and regretted that, whereas Portuguese teams frequently competed in horse shows in Brussels and elsewhere, they had never been to London.   After some further discussion of these subjects, and also of the dominating position of the German press in Portugal, we agreed that the Ambassador should have further conversations at the Foreign Office to agree upon certain active steps which might be taken. I mentioned to him that we had already taken certain measures in respect of cultural propaganda in Portugal, though the resources at our disposal in this [14979] B 2
respect were financially much more limited than those of Germany, which spent so profusely. But we were determined to improve upon our previous efforts in this respect. The Ambassador also undertook to discuss with Mr. Leeper both the question of British news in Portugal and the question of Portuguese news here.I am, &amp;c.ANTHONY EDEN.ENCLOSURE B.Copy 0f a despatch from the Foreign Office to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Lisbon. [W 4669/25/36] (No. 121.) -Sir, Foreign Office, April 5, 1937.WITH reference to my despatch No. 101* of the 16th March regarding Anglo-Portuguese relations, I have to inform your Excellency that M. Monteiro recently called on Sir George Mounsey to discuss with him certain aspects of this problem.2. In the course of conversation the Portuguese Ambassador launched out on a serious dissertation on Anglo-Portuguese relations, and urged that, in their own interests as well as those of the Alliance, His Majesty&apos;s Government should show more interest in Portugal, her strategic situation and the trend of events there.3. M. Monteiro asked why British propaganda in Portugal was of so negligible a quality. To this Sir George Mounsey rejoined that propaganda must have some objective, that our relations with Portugal were of the best, and that unless propaganda was carefully and skilfully carried on, it was apt to do more harm than good. We as a nation were better propagandists in action than in words, and the friendly ways of our soldiers and sailors when quartered abroad seemed somehow to redound more to our credit than all the lectures and pamphlets of our intellectuals. M. Monteiro entirely agreed that bad propaganda is worse than none at all; but he wondered whether it was realised in this country what determined and dangerous forms of propaganda are being carried on in Portuguese schools and colleges by the Germans in particular, and to a lesser extent by the Italians. The Germans are, he said, concentrating all their efforts on the younger generation, and their work is mainly in the different grades of schools. There they show up all the faults and weaknesses of democracies; and represent England as the leading type of democratic country.4. Turning to another point, M. Monteiro asked why His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment showed no interest in the organisation of Portugal&apos;s defence forces. Why did they not send out a military mission to study present conditions and offer advice from their own experience on reorganisation and equipment? He knew that, owing to the unfortunate circumstances in which Portugal had joined in the Great War, with no heart in it, divided sentiments and complete lack of training and preparedness, British military authorities have the poorest opinion of Portuguese military spirit. But this is quite unfair, and their military material now is very different from what it was then. What was needed was an under-standing handling of his nation. The Portuguese became only more and more stubborn when subjected to compulsion or patronage; while they are extraordinarily amenable to a treatment based on good &quot;fellowship and friendly interest.5. M. Monteiro cited the case of the Portuguese Military Mission which recently came abroad to study markets for purchase of military equipment. In France it was given a very good reception, and in Germany it was almost over-whelmed with hospitality and facilities for inspection, &amp;c. In the United Kingdom, however, it was practically ignored and was shown very little, and no interest was displayed.6. The difficulties of the immediate situation owing to the rearmament programme of His Majesty&apos;s Government and the urgent need of concentrating* Enclosure A.
on their own requirements were explained once again to M. Monteiro. It would neither be honest nor make a good impression for His Majesty&apos;s Government to be putting before the Portuguese all manner of tempting offers, knowing all the while that for the moment they could not fulfil them. The situation with regard to supply would, of course, improve, and it was only a matter of a little patience; and M. Monteiro was assured over and over again that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment were most anxious, within their powers, to assist the Portuguese in their rearmament plans. But it was not for His Majesty&apos;s Government to take the initiative : it would be impertinent for them to advise the Portuguese Govern-ment on their re-equipment and offer to reorganise their military system unless a clear invitation was extended to them to do so; and it was pointed out that it was really for the Portuguese. Government to decide what they wanted and then to approach His Majesty&apos;s Government in the matter of their requirements.7. Sir George Mounsey was unable, however, to make M. Monteiro see that the initiative must come from his Government. He kept repeating that if only His Majesty&apos;s Government would show active interest, send out a mission and discuss with them the military and naval situation, the strategic uses of Lisbon, the Azores, the Cape Verde Isles, &amp;c, they would find the Portuguese Government most responsive, and it seems doubtful whether he really believes that it is our own requirements in military equipment which are the main cause of our apparent lack of interest in Portuguese needs.8. In view of the evident anxiety of the Portuguese Government that His Majesty&apos;s Government should make some gesture of friendship which would serve to show that the Alliance is still valued in this country, and in view of the increased importance which Portugal may be expected to acquire as a result of the present conflict in Spain, I have thought it advisable to lay the whole question before the Committee of Imperial Defence, in a letter, a copy of which is enclosed herewith. ^ I shall be glad of the benefit of your Excellency&apos;s views on all these questions in the light of your wide experience of Portuguese affairs, and your knowledge of Portuguese psychology.I am, &amp;c.(For the Secretary of State), D.

Printed for the Committee of Imperial Defence.  July 1937.SECRET. Copy No.1336-B.(Also Paper No. CCS. 602.)COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.ANGLO-PORTUGUESE RELATIONS-IMPORTANCE FROM THE STRATEGICAL POINT OF VIEW.(Previous C.I.D. Paper No. 1320-B.)Report by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee.Introduction.IN accordance with the 292nd Meeting of the Committee of Imperial Defence (Minute 4) we have prepared the following report on the importance of Anglo-Portuguese relations from the strategical point of view : General Strategical Considerations.2. Since Portugal seems unlikely to become an important military Power, we cannot anticipate that her active military participation as an ally would at any time add materially to the strength of our forces. Nevertheless, the military facilities, existing and potential, which her territory both at home and abroad would offer to the armed forces of Great Britain or any. other belligerent, would prove of considerable value in war.3. The strategical value of an alliance with Portugal, therefore, lies in the fact that it enables us to make use of these facilities and at the same time denies their use to a hostile Power. In order to assess the degree of importance which we should attach to our alliance with Portugal, we examine briefly what facilities exist and the extent to which their use by ourselves or by an enemy would affect us in war.Portugal and her possessions in North-West Africa and the Eastern Atlantic.4. Upon examination of previous papers we find that in 1912 the Admiralty expressed their views upon the naval strategic aspect as follows : &quot; If ever the alliance is terminated by action on either side, we should make it a cardinal point of our subsequent policy to see that no maritime State, such as France or Germany, replaces us and thus obtains the right to use the Cape de Verdes, the Azores, or Portuguese Guinea, either as a Sovereign Power or as an ally of Portugal. We should prevent at all costs the transfer of these particular possessions to any strong Naval Power.&quot;The Foreign Office held that the only satisfactory method of meeting these requirements was by the maintenance of the alliance; and they re-affirmed this view when, our relations with Portugal were reconsidered in 1927 (CP. 255 (27) ), although at that time the German menace was, for the time being, eliminated.5. Since that date certain developments in Europe, such as the rearming of Germany, the civil war in Spain, and the new attitude of Italy, have tended to increase the importance of our alliance with Portugal in relation to naval strategy. The outcome of the Spanish struggle cannot yet be foreseen, but it might well result in the establishment of a strong Spanish Government with views quite different, from those which obtained under, the old regime in which no real threat to our position at Gibraltar seemed likely to arise.[15564]
6. If indeed a revival took place in Spain on lines similar to that which Mussolini has achieved in Italy, we might find that in war not only could the use of Gibraltar be denied to us, but the passage of our shipping through the Straits might be made extremely hazardous. In these circumstances, the alternative facilities which Portugal possesses might well prove of great value to our navy.7. In addition to the above considerations, we have to-day to take account of how an alliance with Portugal affects our air strategy. At the best Gibraltar, with its one restricted aerodrome, would be an unsatisfactory link in our air route to Africa and the East in time of war, and the additional facilities which Portugal could provide would be extremely valuable.8. The Azores, * Madeira and the Cape Verde Islands form a triangle through which a large percentage of British sea-borne trade normally passes. The use of air facilities in these islands would, therefore, be of considerable value to us in trade protection. At present these facilities are limited in scope, but the French in particular are anxious for them to be developed further. On the assumption that we should benefit from such facilities in war, our policy should be to encourage any such development as far as this lies within our power.9. The denial of the use of potential bases is just as important in air strategy as in naval strategy; and the views which the Admiralty expressed in 1912 in relation to potential naval bases apply to-day with equal force to existing and potential air bases in Portugal and to her possessions in the Eastern Atlantic and North-West Africa. The scale of attack upon British interests which a hostile air Power could maintain for any length of time from such bases, other than in the Peninsula itself, would, however, depend upon whether that Power could reinforce these bases by direct flight from its metropolitan air force, and the extent to which bombs and fuels had either been accumulated in peace or could be shipped in spite of our sea power.Portuguese Territory in the Far East.10. Among Portuguese possessions in the Far East are Macao in South China, and parts of Timor Island.The former possesses a recently-dredged harbour, protected by 4 miles of breakwater, accommodating vessels drawing up to 20 feet. There is a small naval dockyard (no dry dock) at which minor repairs can be carried out. There is a landing ground at Macao and seaplanes could operate from the vicinity of the outer harbour. We have recently intervened successfully to prevent a concession at Macao for the development of further air facilities being given to the Japanese.Timor Island is an important landfall in the air route between Australia and Singapore.The only landing ground at present in use is in Dutch territory, but sites exist in Portuguese territory which could be developed into landing grounds. Since an attitude of strict neutrality on the part of the Netherlands would be to our advantage in the event of war against Japan, a landing ground in the Portuguese part of Timor Island might prove most useful.Portuguese East Africa and Angola.11. These territories adjoin the former German colonies in Africa, and are therefore easily accessible to German &apos;&apos; peaceful penetration &apos;&apos; through the medium of her overseas Nazi organisations. The existence of a strong hostile element in these areas in time of war might prove a considerable embarrassment both to our-selves and the Government of the Union of South Africa, although it could hardly constitute a threat to the security of that Dominion or Rhodesia. So long as the Anglo-Portuguese alliance exists, therefore, the potential danger from German influences in these territories can more easily be counteracted.Conclusions.12. We conclude that the importance of maintaining our alliance with Portugal has increased with the development of air power, owing, to the fact that, from the air point of view, the Mother Country and her Island possessions in the Eastern Atlantic are admirably situated either for the defence of or attack on our seaborne trade.
2 Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1, July 9, 1937.We cannot forecast the outcome of the Spanish civil war, but since a return to the old and innocuous regime appears unlikely, it may well be that the availability of facilities and anchorages in Portuguese waters, alternative to Gibraltar, will prove of greater value to our navy in the future than in the past.Elsewhere, in Africa and the Far East, it is important that no strong Foreign Power should be permitted to develop a predominant influence in Portuguese territory.13. From every aspect, therefore, we confirm the view that the maintenance of our alliance with Portugal is of great importance.(Signed) CHATFIELD.E. L. ELLINGTON. C. J. DEVERELL.
