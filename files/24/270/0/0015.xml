this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S , GOVERNMENT.SgCRET.170 (57)-.COPY NO.CABINET. STATE OF TRADE - MAY,  1937. Note by the President of the Board of Trade.I circulate to my colleagues a summary of the reports submitted to the Board of Trade Advisory Council on the state of trade in May, 1937*0 * F.G.S*Board of Trader29th June, 1937*
OVERSEAS TRADE.Imports in May at  33.1 m. were  14 m. more than in May, 1936.     Nearly 60 per cent, of the rise was in food and raw materials.     Of the increase of  5.7 m. in manufactured goods,  2.7 m. related to non-ferrous metals and manufactures,  1.5 m. to oils, fats and resins and  337,000 to machinery. Exports of Unioed Kingdom products,  42.7 m., were  6.3 m. more and re-exports,  7.4 m., were  1.8 m. more than in May, 1936.EMPLOYMENT.The total number of unemployed persons on the registersat   24th May - 1,451,330 - was 3,113 less than at 19th April;the changes in the various divisions were:-London........... 4- 1,306     North Eastern ... + 28,374South Eastern .... - 9,957     North Western ... 4-   3,352Southwestern .... - 4,738     Northern........ -   9,153Midlands ......... + 7,606     Scotland ........ - 15,261Wales ........... -   4,662The estimated number of insured workers aged 16-64 in employment (excluding agricultural workers) was 11,337,000 -7,000 less than in April, but 469,000 more than in May, 1936. The reduction as compared with April was mainly due to the London bus dispute.     Employment improved between April and May in building and public works contracting, general engineering, the distributive trades, hotel and boarding-house service, and the road transport services (outside London). There were increases in unemployment in certain industries, some of which (particularly coal and woollens) were affected by holiday stoppages. RAILWAY&apos; TRAFFIC.In the five weeks ended 30th May, railway traffic receipts increased by  934,000 (6.35%) as compared with the corresponding period of 1936.     Passenger traffic increased by 14% and coal, coke and patent fuel by 7.93%, but merchandise, minerals and
  Jolivestock decreased by 3.30%,    (This comparison is affected by the incidence of holidays.      The 1937 period included Whitsun and Coronation Day:    in 1936 Whit Monday fell on 1st June.) BANKING.Money was in ample supply throughout May and the market wasdull.      The Treasury Bill rate fluctuated between 10s.0,19do -10s.6.99d.    The note circulation reached the record figure of 481 m. on 19th May owing to heavy currency requirements forthe Coronation and Whitsun.      The price of gold (140/5-g- -140/10), was remarkably steady, considering the largeamounts on offer and the constant discount on the dollar parity.The franc continued weak, the soot rate fluctuating between 15109 and 110 16   and the discount on the three months forward rate rarely falling much below 2 francs.    The dollar remained steady between 4.93^ and 4,94%until 31st May when it strengthened sharply to 4,92-jj. SHIPPING.Despite a slight falling off in business from the River Plate, the position remained sound.      Considering the disturbed state of commodity markets and the nervousness about gola, all sections were very steady.     The Chamber of Shipping index number of freights (1913     100) was  154.06 as compared with 147.05 in April and 88.46 in May,  1936.      It is stated that increasing shipbuilding costs are deterring some shipowners from contracting for new tonnage. SHIPBUILDING.Clyde shipyards were exceptionally busy and the output of tonnage is rapidly increasing.      Tyne shipyards v/ere busy but anxious to book further orders. COAL.The improvement was maintained and the general outlook remains favourable.      Prices further advanced.    Output for the four weeks ended 22nd Muy (17,56 m. tons) was somewhat less
than in the corresponding period a year before but the -.period included the Coronation and Whitsun holidays and average production per working day was greater.      Exports in May amounted to 3.22 m. tons as compared with 3*16 m. tons a year before.      l&apos;he chief increase was to Italy.     Markets taking less included Canada, Denmark and Brazil. IRON AND STEEL.Pig-iron output (696,300 tons) was 5.3% more than in May, 1936, and the highest recorded for ten years.      Two further furnaces went into blast and one ceased operations;    a further increase in output is anticipated in June.     Crude steel production (1,047,300 tons; was 3.8^o more than a year before, Purchases abroad considerably improved the raw material position.     A United States Government Committee has found thai-scrap shortage in the U.3.A. Is unlikely.     The outlook as regards semis has improved owing to a slackening of pressure on Continental suppliers.     Finished steel producers are reported to be reducing the volume of orders awaiting delivery.    Export business was somewhat quieter.      Exports of iron and steel (223,300) were 11.9$ more than in May, 1936.    Imports were considerably less.All districts continued very busy.      In Scotland supplies of raw material increased but there was still plant idle owing to shortage.      On the North East Coast pig-iron output increased slightly despite the fall in Spanish ore imports;    and with an increase in other ore supplies,   the present output If. expected to he maintained.      In Sheffield and Lincolnshire additional pig-iron supplies and some further increase in steel operations are expected.      In South Wales tinplate manufacturers were more active and demand for galvanised sheets improved, ENGINEERING.General conditions continued favourable and the volume of new business further increased.      Exports of machinery amounted
to  3.8 m. as compared with  3.5 m. in May, 1936.    Imports ( 2 m.) were over  300,000 more, mainly because of increased imports of machine tools, MOTOR INDUSTRY.The number of motor vehicles newly registered in April was 40,741 - 4,446 more than a year before;    the increase in private cars was 2,813.      The production of private cars in March was 44,578 (12*3% more than a year before) and of commercial vehicles 11,045 (2.7% less).    Exports of new private cars and chassis in May amounted to 6,069 and of new commercial vehicles and chassis to 1,802 - 7.3% and 35%, respectively, more than in May, 1936,      1,674 complete new private cars were imported as compared with 859 a year ago. ELECTRICAL INDUSTRY.Activity was maintained.      The index for heavy engineering orders was at about the same level as for April and considerably higher than for May, 1936.      Exports of electrical apparatus and machinery ( 1.45 m.) were 28o5% greater than a year before.      Electricity generated was 11.3% more-NON-FERROUS METALS.Prices of non-ferrous metals were fairly steady, despite uncertainty arising from certain general faators which might well have caused a further decline.     Trade buying was quiet, due partly to the Coronation and Whitsun holidays.    A revival in demand is anticipated shortly. WOOL.General activity decreased appreciably, the decline (which was partly seasonal) being chiefly apparent in the weaving section.     Exports of tops and yarns were less but of tissues greater than a year before.     Reports indicated a scarcity of new orders and enquiries and a reluctance on the part of customers to enter into long-term commitments.-4-
SILK&apos;AND ARTIFICIAL SILK.Rayon.     There was a slight though temporary recession in the weaving trade due to the Coronation and Whitsun holidays, but subsequently the tone of the market became steady Demand for crepe yarns Was slightly better.     Although the spring season for rayon piece goods has on the whole been had, traue has recently greatly improved. .   Exports of yarns and all-rayon fabrics showed marked increases over May 1936 but exports of rayon mixtures were rather less.Silk.    Business was remarkably quiet for the time of years Raw silk prices tended to weaken and prices of fabrics fell. COTTON.There was a decline (largely seasonal) in activity.    New orders were less plentiful but many firms will be busy for several months on existing contracts,,     Average weekly deliveries of raw cotton to spinners were 31.1 m. lbs.-- as compared with 32.3 m. lbs. in April.      The spinning industry operated at 76% of capacity as compared with 85% in April and 79% in May 1936.     Raw cotton prices were unsteady but the prices of yarn and cloth were maintained...     Yarn exports at 14.1 m. lbs. were .7 m. lbs. less than in April (a longer working month) but 1.7 m. lbs. more than in May 1936.    Exports of piece goods at 162 m.  sq. yards were 3 m. sq. yards less than in April but 16 rrw sq. yards more than in May, 1936. Compared with April, exports to India, Switzerland and French West Africa fell substantially:    the chief increases were to Australia and Argentina. HIDES AND LEATHER.The volume of business in the hide markets decreased considerably, due partly to the Coronation and Whitsun holidays;   but demand showed signs of improvement towards the end of May..     Conditions in the leather trade were, in general, quiet.
CHEMICALS *Demand for sulphuric acid continued satisfactory;    the tonnage manufactured&apos; daring the first quarter of 1937 was the highest since 1919.     Home sales of alkalis in May were lower than in April hut exports increased.     Deliveries of chlorine products were satisfactory.     Home sales of dyestuffs were maintained and overseas sales were higher.     Home sales of sulphate of ammonia for the current season are at much the same level as last season;    exports are considerably higher, due to increased sales in Empire markets.      Demand for coal tar products was, in general, good hut there was difficulty in disposing of an increased output of pitch. BUILDING.Activity was well maintained;    the effect of the Defence programme began to be felt,.      Returns received by the Ministry of Labour from 144 Local Authorities showed that the estimated cost of buildings for which plans were approved was  9.0 m. -27=8% less than the figure for May, 1936.     There was a decrease of 24.9% for dwelling houses and of 62% for factories and workshops;    and an increase of 23.7% for other buildings and additions and alterations to existing buildings. RETAIL TRADE.The money value of retail sales in April was 1.5 per cent, higher than in April 1936.      The increase for March was 15.2 per cent.      (the difference between the two figures being mainly due to the variation in the date of Easter in the two years).    Sales of food and perishablep rose by .8 per cent, and of other merchandise by 2.2 per cent.      Preliminary returns for May indicate substantial increases in trade-in most areas.CANADIAN TRADE,Economic conditions were uneven during April.    The index of physical volume of business rose further.      Total exports
*1 [\ 0were greater than in any April since 1929.      Compared with March, exports of copper,  asbestos, wood pulp and planks and hoards increased (after seasonal adjustment);    exports of zinc declined.      Newsprint output was greater than in any previous April.     Imports of bauxite and exports of nickel were post-war records for April.      Iron and steel activity was maintained hut the output of motor cars declined. SOUTH AFRICAN TRADE.The Stock Exchange slump and the reaction in commodity markets in April may result in a temporary slowing down of certain business activities but (assuming an unchanged price for gold and steady commodity markets) conditions are regarded as fundamentally sound.      The maize market remained weak, but the wool market continued firm and active until the close of April when there was some reaction.Imports in March were 17.6$ greater than in March 1936. .% Exports (excluding gold) were 38.8$ more, due mainly to greatly increased wool shipments.      Gold shipments were 17.4$ less but the tonnage of ore crushed was greater. SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE.Argentina.    Shipments of agricultural products during January/April were over double in volume and nearly three times in value those a year before.      Total imports increased by 16.3%:    the United Kingdom share, despite some recovery during April, was less than during January/April,  1936.      The foreign debt repatriation loan of $200 m. was successfully floated. The cattle market was very firm.      The &apos;free&apos; peso-sterling rate appreciated.Brazil.    The coffee market was very quiet.      Total coffee shipments for the crop year since 1st July, 1936, have been substantially less than a year before.      The new cotton crop was arriving in considerable volume and quotations continued to decline. Due largely to the break in the coffee market in February, the favourable visible trade balance has contracted sharply.
Colombia.    New crop coffee was arriving in abundant quantities;    the slight recovery in price was maintained,Chile.    Business conditions were very satisfactory.Peru.    The sugar quota assigned to Peru at the International Conference is generally considered satisfactory. The sol depreciated slightly in terms of sterling and German currencies.Paraguay.    The financial situation was improving.    Hide exports during May were up to average and hard wood exports continued satisfactory.-     Maize and rice crops have been substantial this year and an excellent sugar crop is anticipated.     Heavy rains have damaged, the cotton crop.Uruguay.    The &quot;free1&apos; peso-sterling rate appreciated.&apos;
