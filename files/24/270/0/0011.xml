THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   June 1937.SECRET. Copy No.CP. 166 (37).CABINET.REPORT OF PALESTINE ROYAL COMMISSION.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.(A) Procedure.I REGRET the necessity for asking my colleagues to expedite the consideration of such a formidable document as the Report of the Palestine Royal Commission, copies of which were circulated to them on the 22nd June (CP. 163 (37)). I am, however, convinced, for reasons which I will explain, that it is essential to formulate at the earliest possible date our views on the main recommendations of the Commission, and I trust that it may be possible to arrive at conclusions on the main points at issue in time for publication simultaneously with the Report itself on Ihe 7th July.2. My colleagues are aware of the special interest taken in the Palestine question by the Permanent Mandates Commission and of the undertaking that His Majesty&apos;s Government have given to participate in discussion of the Report of the Commission, together with the Annual Reports on Palestine for the years 1935 and 1936, at a special session which is to be held at the end of July. I have recently received a letter from M. Orts, the Chairman of the Permanent Mandates Commission, in which he asked me to agree to the 30th July as the date for the opening of the special session, and drew attention to the grave inconvenience Avhich would be caused by further postponement. I have told him that I accept the date suggested, but that if it should appear that the documents cannot be sent to Geneva in time to allow a sufficient period for preliminary study, I will take him into consultation. It will, I am sure, be agreed that, when I go to Geneva, I must be in a position to inform the Permanent Mandates Commission of the policy which His Majesty&apos;s Government propose to follow.I have also given an undertaking that Parliament shall have an opportunity of debate on the Report of the Royal Commission before the end of the session, and it will in any case be necessary at that stage to give the House some indication of the Governments conclusions on the Report.3. After careful consideration of the alternatives, I am. strongly in favour of the simultaneous publication of the Report with the conclusions of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the form of a Command Paper. As indicated above, publication should, if possible, be made on Wednesday, the 7th July, in order to allow the Permanent Mandates Commission reasonable time for distribution of copies to members and for preliminary study. If this should prove to be impracticable, publication and transmission to Geneva might be deferred until the following Wednesday, the 14th July, but that would be the latest possible date, and the time available for study at Geneva would be lamentably short. If the Report (which could not, in any case, be published before the 7th July if time is to be allowed for preliminary distribution of Arabic translations of the summary in Middle Eastern countries) were to be published without any indication of the attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government, we should be subject in the intervening period to most embarrassing pressure, both in Parliament and from various quarters abroad, and in Palestine itself such a state of uncertainty would seriously aggravate the existing state of tension.[15463] ^ .

4. I have suggested that the Report and the conclusions of His Majesty&apos;s Government should be released for publication on a Wednesday because I am informed that release on any later day in the week should be avoided as affecting, on religious grounds, newspaper publicity in Palestine on the following days. It is, therefore, proposed that the documents should be released to the Press and to the Palestine Broadcasting Service at 8 p.m. (local time) on a Wednesday evening, and in London at 8 p.m. (summer time) to the Press and the British. Broadcasting Corporation, on the understanding that nothing would be published by the Press until the Thursday morning, and that the British Broadcasting Corporation should be asked not to broadcast any news of the Report until midnight on the Wednesday in the Empire News Bulletin. Lobby Press correspondents would, of course, be given the usual privilege of advance copies on a confidential footing.5. A note is appended* showing the arrangements which have been made for distribution of advance copies of the Report and its Summary to the Representatives of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Dominions, India, the United States, and in various foreign countries in Europe and the Middle East. It is proposed to telegraph confidentially to these Representatives, in advance of publication, the substance of the proposed Command Paper embodying the conclusions of the Government.I suggest that it will be desirable to take into confidence representatives of the Opposition and other sections of Parliamentary opinion, and I should like authority to send copies of the Report and Summary in strict confidence to the following Privy Councillors : Mr. Winston Churchill, Mr. Lloyd George, Mr. Amery, Mr. Attlee, Mr. Greenwood, Sir Archibald Sinclair, Lord Samuel and Lord Snell.(B) Policy.6. It would be difficult in any circumstances for His Majesty&apos;s Government to advise the rejection of the main argument and essential recommendations of a unanimous Royal Commission, and especially having regard to the circumstances in which this Commission was appointed and to the strength of its personnel. Consideration of the lucid and penetrating analysis of the situation which is contained in the Report, supplemented by discussions which I have had with members of the Commission, leads me to accept without hesitation the Commission^ diagnosis of the root of the trouble as a conflict of irreconcilable national aspirations, and their main conclusion that the best hope of a permanent solution, just to both parties and consonant with our obligations both to Jews and to Arabs, lies in the drastic and difficult operation of partition.7. The particular scheme of partition which is submitted in the Report and illustrated by the sketch Map No. 8 appears to me to be equitable and well conceived in its main outlines. Modifications of detail may be found necessary in the course of the further investigation which will be required. Numerous practical difficulties, which the Commission do not under-estimate, will no doubt present themselves, but I see no reason why, given a reasonable measure of consent, these difficulties should not be surmounted.8. The scheme involves, as any such scheme must, a heavy charge, which cannot yet be estimated, on the Exchequer, but no other scheme offers a prospect of escape from the maintenance for an indefinite period of a policy of repression, and, as the Commission put it on page 373 of their Report, &quot;If &apos; disturbances &apos; should recur on a similar scale to that of last year&apos;s rebellion the cost of military operations must soon exhaust the revenues of Palestine and ultimately involve the British Treasury to an incalculable extent.&quot;9. The Commission realise, as their Report shows, that their proposal for partition, involving as it does the abrogation of the existing Mandate and the
substitution of a new form of Mandate over the proposed British enclaves, will require the consent of the Council of the League of Nations. Moreover, by virtue of the Anglo-American Convention of 1924,* the Government of the United States has certain special rights in connection with Palestine; but I understand that the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs has been advised that, so long as these rights are not affected, the consent of the United States to the proposed partition scheme is not required, since that Government (in Article I of the Convention of 1924) assented to the Mandate as a whole, including Article XXVII, which implies that the Mandate may be altered with the consent of the Council of the League of Nations.10. It is obvious, moreover, that, without a reasonable measure of assent on the part of the two peoples concerned, no scheme of partition involving the establishment of two independent States can be put into effect. Consideration must be given to the procedure which is to be adopted for obtaining the views of the two communities and for commending the proposal of the Commission to them on the basis of the arguments contained in the Report. It is, of course, possible that the Jews might accept partition and the Arabs refuse, and it is possible, but less probable, that the Arabs might accept and the Jews refuse. In that event, it would be necessary to consider whether His Majesty&apos;s Government would be justified in taking steps with a view to setting up one independent State while retaining mandatory control over the rest of the country.But for immediate purposes, that is to say, for the information of Parliament and of the Permanent Mandates Commission and the Government of the United States, what is required, and what I hope may be approved by the Cabinet, is an announcement to the effect that His Majesty&apos;s Government accept in principle the conclusions and recommendations of the Royal Commission and will proceed without delay to take such steps as are necessary and appropriate, having regard to their obligations under the Covenant of the League and other international instruments, to enable them to put into force a scheme of partition on the lines recommended in the Report, in the hope that an effective measure of consent will be forthcoming on the part of the communities concerned.11. If this is approved I would propose to inform the Permanent Mandates Commission, as regards the partition scheme, that His Majesty&apos;s Government accept in principle the recommendation of the Commission, and that, in the hope of securing an effective measure of consent on the part of the communities concerned, they propose to submit to the Council of the League of Nations a request, which the Council will no doubt refer to the Permanent Mandates Commission for consideration, for approval of the abrogation of the existing Mandate and such other features of the scheme as require the sanction of the League.12. I see no reason why His Majesty&apos;s Government should not express their agreement in principle with the recommendations (summarised in Chapter XIX at the end of Part II of the Report) for dealing with Arab and Jewish grievances in the event of the continuance of mandatory administration in its present form. I should, however, wish to consult with the High Commissioner for Palestine before taking action to put all these recommendations into effect. For the present I suggest that it will be sufficient to announce that His Majesty&apos;s Government approve these recommendations in principle, and that they will be guided by them in the event of continuance of the present form of mandatory administration.13. There are, however, two closely connected recommendations (see par,a-graphs 57 and 58 of Chapter VII) which, although included in Part IT of the Report, are clearly not dependent upon a continuance of the mandatory regime.These recommendations are^ (i) that &quot; should disorders break out again of such a nature as to require the intervention of the military, there should be no hesitation in enforcing martial law throughout the country under undivided military control,&quot; and (ii) that in that event further steps should be taken to enforce disarmament of the population.* Cmd. 2559.[15463] - B 2
The Commission attach great importance to these recommendations, which are endorsed by the High Commissioner, and I strongly urge that in the Command Paper announcing the policy of the Government it should be made clear that effect will be given to them.14. In Part III of the Report the Commission make certain recommenda-tions for action during the period of &quot; transition &quot; that must elapse between a decision to terminate the Mandate and establish a Treaty system and the intro-duction of the new regime. Some considerable time may, however, elapse before this &quot; transition &quot; period begins. For this initial interim period the Report makes no provision, but there are two important matters, viz., land and immigra-tion, in connection with which decisions must be taken immediately for this interim period : (a) Land. During the initial interim period I would propose that steps should be taken to prohibit any land transactions which might prejudice the scheme of partition, and that this should be made clear in the proposed statement of policy.(b) Immigration. The recommendation in Chapter X, paragraph 97, that&apos;&apos; a political high level&apos;&apos; for Jewish immigration should be fixed at 12,000 immigrants a year for the next five years is based on the assumption of the continuance of the present mandatory system, and in Chapter XXII, paragraph 49 (2), a modification of this arrange-ment is recommended for the later &apos;&apos; transition &apos;&apos; period. I have discussed with the High Commissioner the action to be taken during the initial interim period, and we are agreed that, in all the circum-stances, the simplest and fairest arrangement would be to lay down that for the eight months&apos; period August 1937 to March 1938 a total Jewish immigration in all categories of 8,000 shall be permitted. This will involve amendment of the Immigration Ordinance.15. With reference to the proposal on page 385 of the Report that Haifa and Acre should remain temporarily under British Mandatory rule, I learn from Sir Arthur Wauchope that this may have a very important bearing on the reception of the report by the Arabs, and that it is advisable to announce that Haifa and Acre and their environs will be so reserved for at least ten years, at the end of which time the question of their incorporation in the proposed Jewish State will be open for consideration in the light of the then existing conditions.16. I circulate as an appendix* to this document a letter which I have received from a member of the Royal Commission, as I think it will assist my colleagues in considering some of the issues that arise out of the Report.17. In order to facilitate and expedite consideration of these questions I suggest, as a tentative basis for discussion, the following draft of a Statement of Policy for publication simultaneously with the Report on the 7th July : (1) His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom, by direction of His Majesty, have considered the unanimous Report of the Palestine Royal Commission. They find themselves in general agreement with the arguments and conclusions of the Commission and propose to advise His Majesty to accept in principle the recommendations contained in the Report.(2) As is fully recognised by the Commissioners in their historical survey, His Majesty&apos;s Government and their predecessors, since the obliga-tions of the Mandate were accepted, have taken the view, which the tenor of the Mandate itself implies, that their obligations to Jews and Arabs were not incompatible, on the assumption that in the process of time the two races would so adjust their national aspirations as to render possible the establishment of a single commonwealth under a unitary government.
(3) In spite of many discouraging experiences during the past seventeen years, His Majesty &apos;s Government have based their policy on this expectation and have taken every opportunity of encouraging co-operation between Arabs and Jews. In the light of experience and of the arguments adduced by the Commission they are driven to the conclusion that there is an irreconcilable conflict between the national aspirations of Jews and Arabs in Palestine, that these aspirations cannot be satisfied under the terms of the present Mandate and that a scheme of partition on the lines recom-mended by the Commission represents the best and most hopeful solution of the deadlock. They do not think it necessary to comment on the details of the scheme except to state their conclusion that the period for which Haifa and Acre and their environs should remain under mandatory administration should be not less than ten years, and that at the end of that period the question of their incorporation in the proposed Jewish State should be open to consideration in the light of the circumstances of the time.(4) His Majesty&apos;s Government accordingly propose to take such steps as are necessary and appropriate, having regard to their existing treaty obligations under the Covenant of the League and other international instruments, to place themselves in a position to give effect to the proposed scheme of partition, in the hope that an effective measure of consent will be forthcoming on the part of the communities concerned.(5) Until this hope is realized His Majesty&apos;s Government have no intention of surrendering their responsibility for peace, order and good government throughout Palestine. They are in general agreement with the Commission^ recommendations in the matter of public security. If disorders should again break out, of such a nature as to require military intervention, the High Commissioner will immediately, and in respect of the whole country, delegate powers under the Palestine (Defence) Orders-in-Council to the General Officer Commanding the military forces, and steps will be taken to enforce disarmament.(6) In the immediate future, while the possibility of partition is being explored, His Majesty&apos;s Government propose that, as interim measures, steps should be taken to prohibit any land transactions which might prejudice the scheme of partition; and that for the eight months&apos; period August 1937 to March 1938, a total Jewish immigration in all categories of 8,000 persons shall be permitted, provided that the economic absorptive capacity of the country is not exceeded.(7) The recommendations contained in Part II of the Report are accepted in principle by His Majesty&apos;s Government, and their policy will be guided by these recommendations, in the event of the scheme of partition not proving practicable.(8) His Majesty&apos;s Government propose to advise His Majesty accordingly, and to cause to be prepared in due course estimates of the sums which Parliament will be asked to vote in connection with certain of the proposals of the Commission.(9) In commending the scheme of partition, His Majesty&apos;s Government are much impressed by the advantages which it offers both to the Arabs and the Jews. Arabs would obtain their national independence, and thus be enabled   to   co-operate   on   an   equal   footing   with   the   Arabs   of
Colonial Office, Downing Street, June 25, 1937.neighbouring countries in the cause of Arab unity and progress. They would be finally delivered from all fear of Jewish domination, and from the anxiety which they have expressed lest their Holy Places should ever come under Jewish control. The Arab State would receive financial assistance on a substantial scale.both from His Majesty&apos;s Government and from the Jewish State. On the other hand, partition would secure the establishment of the Jewish National Home and remove all fear of Arab domination. It would convert the Jewish National Home into a Jewish State with full control over immigration. Its nationals would acquire a status similar to that enjoyed by the nationals of other countries. The Jews would at last cease to live a &quot; minority life,&quot; and the primary objective of Zionism would thus be attained. Under the proposed Treaties the rights of minorities in both States would be strictly guaranteed. Above all, fear and suspicion would be replaced by a sense of confidence and security, and both peoples would obtain, in the words of the Commission, &quot; the inestimable boon of peace.&quot;(Initialled) W.

APPENDIX I.Arrangements for Distribution of Advance Copies of the Report, Summary and Conclusions of His Majesty&apos;s Government.ADVANCE copies of the Report and of the Summary, for the confidential information of the persons concerned, and for the purpose of communication to the Press when publication is authorised, have been distributed to the following destinations :- The Officer Administering the Government of Palestine, The Governor of Aden, The Viceroy of India,The United Kingdom High Commissioners in Canada, South Africa, Australia and the Governor-General of New Zealand. It has been arranged that the Acting Prime Minister in each of the Dominions should receive one advance copy of the Report.His Majesty&apos;s Representatives in European countries: at Paris, Rome, Berlin, Warsaw, Bucharest, Vienna, The Hague, Brussels, Prague, Belgrade,-Moscow, Athens, Budapest and the Vatican.His Majesty&apos;s Representatives in the Middle East: at Cairo, Bagdad, Jeddah, Istanbul, Tehran, Mosul, Basra, Beirut, Damascus and Aleppo.His Majesty&apos;s Representatives in the United States.. ^Arrangements have been made for copies of the Report to be transmitted to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, but these will not be made available at Geneva until publication is authorised.The Government of Palestine are preparing translations of the Summary into Arabic and Hebrew for the purposes of an official communique to the Press immediately upon publication. Copies of the Arabic translation will be distri-buted to His Majesty&apos;s Representatives at Cairo, Bagdad, Jeddah, Beirut, Damascus and Aleppo, and to the Governor of Aden, who will use them for the same purpose.Arrangements will be made for the substance of the White Paper containing the Conclusions of His Majesty&apos;s Government to be telegraphed to the same authorities who will already have received copies of the Report and Summary. The Conclusions will be translated into Arabic and Hebrew by the Government of Palestine for purposes of publication, and if time permits, copies of the Arabic translation will be distributed to Middle Eastern Representatives as described above.In every case these documents will be kept in strict official custody until publication is authorised, but it has been agreed that His Majesty&apos;s Represen-tative at Jeddah should be authorised to explain the substance of the Report and of the Conclusions of His Majesty&apos;s Government to King Ibn Saud orally and in confidence a few days before general publication.APPENDIX II.Letter from Professor Reginald Coupland to the Secretary of State for theColonies, June 23, 1937.(Secret.)Dear Ormsby Gore,YOU asked me to put on paper some comments on our Partition proposals. Since those proposals do not constitute (as the Report explains) a fully detailed scheme, there are a few points on which perhaps a little further explanation may be useful, and, naturally, there are some arguments which could not be published.This note only expresses my personal opinions, but it is based on the discussions of the Commission, and I have no doubt that my colleagues would -agree with it on all important points.
(1) The Treaties (page 381). Both States will, of course, maintain their own defence forces, and conceivably the Arabs might be anxious as to possible aggression on the part of a highly trained Jewish army. The safeguards against this seem adequate, namely : (a) As the Treaties will be Treaties of alliance, the Jewish State cannotattack the Arab State without making war on Britain.(b) The Jews are unlikely in any case to quarrel with us, and the fact that so much of their State will be within range of naval guns seems a fair guarantee for their observing their Treaty.(2) The Union of Trans-Jordan with Arab Palestine (page 381). This recommendation is bound to stimulate the antagonism of the Mufti and the Husseini faction towards Abdulla, whose loyalty to us last year has weakened his prestige at Jerusalem. But the Nashashibi and all those Arabs who desire a quiet life (though under present conditions they dare not openly oppose the Extremists) are probably On Abdulla&apos;s side at heart. In our Report we deprecated trusting to the Moderates as a policy for making the Mandate work for an indefinite time to come. But backing the Moderates in order to obtain a quick settlement is another matter. In any case, the arguments for the union were so strong that it seemed right definitely to propose it.  They are as follows : (a) Without Trans-Jordan, the Arab State, though more than twice as large as the Jewish State, would be very small and cut off by Trans-Jordan from union with Syria.(b) Trans-Jordan,  left  to itself,  would  remain  desperately  backward,whereas, if united with Arab Palestine, it would have the benefit of the better educated and more experienced Palestinian Arab officials, some of whom are quite competent administrators.(c) Our proposals for the exchange of land and population are bound up withthe union. There is probably some land capable of development near the sea between Gaza and the Egyptian frontier, but Beersheba as a whole is a very doubtful proposition, and the chances of irrigating land in Trans-Jordan seem far greater. If Trans-Jordan remained a separate State, it would have to agree to its land being developed for the benefit of Arabs from Palestine, while Arab Palestine would be deprived of the thousands of subjects and taxpayers whose seclusion from the Arab State by Partition is the hardest thing it has to bear.(d) Without union, the element of purchase, which is such an essential partof our Plan, loses most of its force. The Palestinian Arabs would only get the Jewish subvention. The  2,000,000 (in respect of the back-wardness of Trans-Jordan) and the gift of irrigation works would accrue to Trans-Jordan only.(3) The Mandated Enclave (page 382). If Partition is adopted, the question of the admission of Jews into the Mandated enclave will arise. On that point it did not seem necessary to say more than that the Balfour Declaration with all its implications would not apply to the enclave. In law, therefore, the Jews will have no more right to settle in the enclave than they have to settle in Tanganyika, but it is possible that, under pressure of escape from Europe, they might try to squeeze into it. The land between the hills and the sea is mostly in Arab occupa-tion. The stony hills offer no livelihood to Jews. The only opening is for com-mercial purposes in the growing suburbs of Jerusalem. It would seem reasonable that under the new Mandate the Government should discourage further Jewish land-purchase in the Plain part of the enclave; but Jews might be admitted to the suburbs of Jerusalem in so far as there is housing and employment for them. This ought not to involve the sort of recurrent controversy which the present quota system entails, because (a) the number of Jews who could make a living at Jerusalem is limited; (b) most Jews will want to settle in the Jewish State; (c) they will be able to squeeze as many Jews into that State as they choose.(4) The Frontier (page 383).-We have said it is unjust in all the circum-stances to crystallize the territorial basis of the National Home exactly as it is now, and we have therefore allowed for some expansion.   There are only two
directions for expansion, one southwards down the Maritime Plain towards the Egyptian frontier, the other northwards in accordance with our Plan. The following are the main arguments for preferring this Northern Plan : (a) The Arab population left in the Jewish: Area is not much greater in theNorth than in the South. In the South the bulk of the Arabs are in the Maritime Plain, whence the Jews, in order to expand their land settlement, would want to turn them out. In the North the bulk of the Arabs are in the hills of Galilee, where the Jews, who&apos; must have&apos; irrigated plain land, will not want to disturb them. There is plenty of room for Jewish expansion for 20 years&apos; to come in the plains of the North.(b) The Jews have a very old tradition of contact with Galilee; and theGalilee Arabs have never till recently been stirred up against the Jews&quot;.[N.B.-None the less, there is bound to be violent feeling at the&apos; first intimation that they are to come under Jewish rule. , One assumes that the Palestine Government will station British police or troops-there before the Report is&apos; published. Otherwise&apos; there fhight be a&apos; pogrom&apos; (e.g., at Safad).](c) Jewish representations made it clear that the Jews are most anxious tobe in contact with the Lebanon State, both for political and commercial reasons. .(d) A Southern Plan would cut the Arab State off from access to the seathrough its own territory except by a devious route over the hills&apos; to Acre. The Northern Plan gives the Arab State a good stretch of sCa-board with easy access from Southern Judaea to Gaza.(e) Presumably the Military Convention could secure British control of theRailway in an emergency.The Jews are likely to plead (i) that the frontier should cross the Jordan to cover Rutenberg&apos;s. Power Station. This seems inadvisable,- because the Arabs have so bitterly resented the Jews monopolizing the waters, of the Jordan. The Rutenberg Scheme was a- mistake (especially in view of the oil pipe-line), and it would help to assuage Arab feeling if the frontier runs down the middle of. the river (ii) that the line drawn down the edge of the, Maritime Plain ought to run along the top of the hills, not along the bottom, for strategic reasons. This seems to be a matter for the Frontier Commission; but it may be pointed out.(a) that, since the frontier crosses Mount Carmel, it would enable the Jews to out-flank the Arab line along the hills to the South; (b) a frontier along the top of the hills would bring a great many more Arabs into the Jewish State.(5) The &quot;Mixed&quot; Towns in the Jewish State (page 385). Our proposal that the Mandatory Government should continue to administer Haifa, Acre, Tiberias and Safad is mainly intended to&quot; soften the blow ( of Partition to the Arabs. The administration of those separate, units would&apos; probably not be so difficult as it may seem, considering how near they are to&apos; one another. Nor is it likely that the Jews would give trouble, since (a) they will be sensitive to world criticism&apos; of their treatment of the Arabs;(b) they will be afraid that maltreatment of the Arabs would mean a-massacre of Jews in (say) Baghdad. Indeed, I have heard it suggested that the Jews would positively welcome assistance from us in this matter;(c) one of the advantages of Partition to the Jews is that, once the quarrelis patched tip in Palestine, they will be able to resume friendly relations with Other Arab States.If the situation seems, fairly hopeful at the time the Treaties come into force, it might be desirable to waive this part of the Plan and leave the adminis-tration of, the three smaller towns io the Jews. In that case, a Political Agent of the Mandatory Goverriment might be posted in each town. Haifa, of course, should remain under Mandatory administration.[15463] C
. (6) Jaffa (page 385). It would be administratively easier if Jaffa were, like Ramie and Lydda, under Mandatory administration, but its being treated as a detached part of the Arab State will certainly be welcomed by the Arabs.The proposal for the belts of Mandated land on each side of Jaffa is the most artificial suggestion that we make, but we are faced with an artificially created situation, and the proposal in itself seems quite practicable. It contemplates a belt of park land with railings and a road running north and south through each belt with gates at each end. There would also be roads running east and west between the enclave and the sea. If a joint port is ever made for Jaffa and Tel Aviv, the road running through the northern belt would end at a Mandated section of the quay between the Arab and Jewish sections.(7) The Transition Period (page 393). Our brief proposals for the transition period are those which would have effect between the time that the Treaties are concluded and the time the Treaties come into force, which, I suppose, on the Syrian precedent, would be not less than three years. The immigration proposal is clearly the most important. It is based on the idea that, given a Treaty settlement, the Jews ought to be allowed to bring as many immigrants into the. Jewish Area as they can assimilate, and we contemplate that economic absorptive capacity would in these circumstances be liberally interpreted.it seems essential that the Government of Palestine should be stiffened up for the Transition. So far the administration has not been very creditable. Can we not recover our prestige by a good clean job to finish up with? It means introducing a few first-rate men at the top, with administrative experience and driving force.(8) The immediate future. Presumably the Plan will be violently attacked on its appearance by the Arabs and by at least a large section of the Jews, but one cannot help hoping that the advantages to both sides set out on pages 394-395 will presently induce both parties to acquiesce. But it is, of course, conceivable that both parties will continue to oppose Partition. In that event, we contemplate that the recommendations made in Part II of the Report will be applied. From the Jewish standpoint this means that immigration is restricted to a maximum of 12,000 for five years, whereas they are desperately anxious to get in three or four times that number without delay for fear of their situation in Germany and Poland getting dangerously worse. We have deliberately left open the question of restricting immigration after five years, but since we have attacked the principle of economic absorptive capacity and introduced the principle of a political high level, the Jews would have to contemplate the possibility of a continued political restriction after the five years were up.The Arabs, on their side, want no further immigration at all. They will bitterly resent the intrusion of 12,000 a year for five years, and from their point of view it would seem possible that after the five years are up full economic absorptive capacity would be restored.The Arabs will further be confronted with our recommendation that if they try to stop immigration by rebellion they will be treated with the utmost severity.It is to be hoped that these reflections may induce acquiescence on both sides. Of the two, Jewish acquiescence seems more likely, and if the Jews accept Partition and the Arabs continue to&apos; oppose it, might it not be possible to bring diplomatic pressure to bear upon the Arabs in the matter of Jewish immigration \The above are the sort of comments which I think you wanted me to make. May I add a. few words to amplify the case against the old and, I hope, discredited policy of trying to carry on under the present mandate by restricting Jewish immigration and counting on the co-operation of moderate Arabs ?(i) In the existing circumstances in Palestine it seems just common sense that a political high level should be imposed for Jewish immigration, and, of course, the High Commissioner has the power to limit or suspend immigration at any time for any reason he thinks fit. But though a political high level can reasonably be imposed for a period (we suggest five years), its maintenance as a permanent principle is open to formidable criticism from the Jews, who can argue (a) that, morally, a political limit does not accord with what they were given to under-stand at the. time of the Balfour Declaration, and (b) that, legally, political factors ought not to be involved, since (1) under Article 2 of
the Mandate we are &quot; responsible for placing the country under such political, administrative and economic conditions as will secure the establishment of the Jewish National Home,&quot; and (2) &quot; immigration under suitable conditions &quot; in Article 6, taken with its context, can only mean technical conditions, not political, (ii) Restriction on political grounds must be arbitrary. The figure we propose for five years is an arbitrary figure, and it would be difficult to maintain such a figure permanently under Jewish pressure. If there were a pogrom in Poland, could Government argue that not one more Jew than the political total fixed could possibly be admitted into Palestine ?(iii) Restriction offers no finality.  The fact that any political high level might conceivably be modified under Jewish pressure does not relieve the Arab mind of all possibility of some day being &quot; swamped.&quot;(iv) Lastly, as pointed out on page 307, [a) numbers are not the soleconsideration in Arab eyes; they know that one Jew is a match for several Arabs; (b) restriction of immigration fails to solve the political problem; whatever the size of the National Home, it bars the way to Arab independence.Yours sincerely,R. COUPLAND.
