SJ5CEBT.0.P.161 (57). CCCAB I IT E T.Y ITO.&apos;g-IE IMBjr&amp;IALCOHEERENCE.MFAIQg^WJM BY THE S&apos;fSCRE5AHY PP.. SQ?AQ?1 FOB TOMENTOK -AFFAIRS.1.     At the meeting ef the Cabinet on Wednesday, the 16th June (Cabinet 24 (37) Conclusion 5), I undertook that,  after consultation with the ether Ministers concerned, I would circulate a memorandum containing information as to certain conclusions of the Imperial Conference with regard.to munitions, civil aviation, Empire trade and shipping, which had not been published.    I have accordingly prepared the following memorandum dealing Yvdth these subjects, in consultation with the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence,  the Secretary of State for Air and the President of the Board of Trade respectively.Muni t ions... and ...Fp.o d_._S.upT3lie s. 2a      It was not found possible - nor indeed would it have been desirable - to publish much information regarding munitions and food supplies.    The published material is contained in the penultimate paragraph of Section X of the Summary of Proceedings of theImperial
Imperial Conference (Cnid.5482).    In addition to the conclusions set out in that paragraph, agreement was reached2-(l) that liaison arrangements between the Supply-Organisation of the United Kingdom and all Dominions represented at the Conference and India should be completed.;(2) that the United Kingdom Government should consider intensively possible peace orders to the Government munitions establishments in Australia and India and should, as far as practicable, give priority to Dominion and Indian peace orders for war material from this c ountry;(5) that the possibility of using Canadian industry for munitions production generally and particularly for Bren gun production should be further studied by the Governments of the United Kingdom and Canada? (4) as to the vital necessity to the United Kingdom in time of war of supplies of essential raw materials from the Dominions.    (No assurance of continuance of supply in war was obtained from the Conference, though the Ministerial representatives of the Dominions and the representative of India on the Committee on Munitions and Food Supplies expressed the personal view that supply would continuej)(5) that in the next few months information should be exchanged between the United Kingdom Government and the Dominion Governments represented, the Governments of India,Southern
Southern Rhodesia and Burma, as to the United Kingdom.&apos;s plans for controlling food imports in time of war and as to the method by which purchases could best be made or bulk contracts placed in the oversea countries for specific quantities of food supplies and feeding stuffs in time of war.Civil Aviation3c     As regards civil aviation, the main points on whioh agreement was reached have been published in Section XV of the Summary of proceedings and it is necessary only to add that(a)    Although finality was not reached, discussions also took place regarding the proposed air services across the Tasman Sea between Australia and New Zealand and across the Pacific from New Zealand to the United States and Canada, the latter necessarily a more distant project, and it was left to Mr. Nash, the Minister of Finance, New Zealand, to ask for further meetings if he wished for them.-    When the Conference terminated, the Commonwealth of Australia Delegation were awaiting a reply from Australia to certain enquiries regarding the trans-Tasman Service which they had made as a result of the discussions. This reply has sinoe beenreceived
received and is favourable.      In consequence the Tasman project is now formally agreed upon by all three Governments.(b) Whilst the Dominions and India were generally favourable to a policy of encouraging production of civil aircraft within the British Commonwealth and the use so far as possible by British Commonwealth air lines of aircraft so produced,  the Union of South Africa representatives (whilst saying that this was in fact their policy) took exception to the idea of proclaiming the policy in a published resolution of the Conference.      Their objection was based on two grounds(i) general policy, i.e0,  the avoidance of anything suggestive of economic nationalism, and(ii) formal public acceptance of such a policy by the Union Delegation might give rise to political difficulties in the Union: this might make it difficult for the Union Government to follow the policy in question.(c) As regards the Commonwealth air route round the world, there was some hesitation shown by the Canadian Delegation in accepting the project for a route across, the Pacific viaSan Francisco to New Zealand and the matter was left indeterminate. It seems doubtful whether Canada will be ready at present&apos; to undertake any active participation in a Trans-pacific air service to New Zealand.(d) The Canadian delegation also demurred to the principle of pooling of bargaining powers by the countries of the Commonwealth for the purpose of securing advantages for the British Commonwealth as a whole in developing itsair routes in competition with those ofother
other countries.      The resolution eventually agreed upon embodied a measure of compromise in. order to meet the Canadian standpoint.        The resolution however constitutes a definite and satisfactory agreement for co-operation.Empire Trade^.4.       As regards Empire trade,  there is little to add to Sections XI and XVII and the penultimate paragraph of Section IX of the Summary of Proceedings.       It will he noted that the proposal of the Commonwealth of Australia Delegation for the estahlisiiment of an Empire Agricultural Council was hot accepted. Whilst the main opposition to this proposal came from the Dominion Delegations and it was on this account that the proposal was not approved, the decision in this matter was not unwelcome to the United Kingdom Delegation.The question of a possible.waiver of Dominion rights in respect of tariff preferences in this country, in the interest of a trade agreement between the United Kingdom and the United States, was not dealt with as part of the Conference proceedings, hut has formed the subject of separate discussions which the President of the Board of Trade and I have had with the Ministers and/or High Commissioners of individual Dominions. As the result of these discussions a draft letter to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Washington has been prepared for consideration by the Committee of the Cabinet on Trade and Agriculture.Shipping
Shl  ing.5.      As regards shipping,  some difficulty arose in securing the agreement of the representatives of the Union of South Africa to.any declaration regarding a common policy for the maintenance of British shipping and its defence against foreign competition, which would go beyond the resolution of the Imperial Economic Conference of 1923 as to flag discrimination.      Eventually, however,  it was found possible to arrive at agreement on the statement contained in the Summary of Proceedings which was in substance drafted by the Union delegation, and is, from our point of view, generally satisfaction sfactory.The particular question of the position of British shipping in the Pacific resulting from subsidised United States competition was discussed by a Sub-Committee representing the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, and the discussion has been continued since the termination of the Imperial Conference.      General agreement in principle has been reached for the construction of 2 new ships -at a cost of about  3,600,000 to be raised by the Shipping Company  2,600,000 of which would be guaranteed (the exact method has not yet been decided)  by the Governments concerned.      The loan would be redeemed with interest by regular annual payments by the Governments over a period of 20 years.      In addition payment would be made for mails, and the payments by the Dominions on this account would contain a small element of subsidy.      The final details in regard to the guarantee and the annual payments are still under discussion.M.M.June 25th.1937.
