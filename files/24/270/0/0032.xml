This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government)SECRET hA- Copy No.-7. .CP. (37) 187.CABINETCLOSER ASSOCIATION BETWEEN SOUTHERN RHODESIA s NORTHERN RHODESIA AND NYASALANDJoint Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs and the Secretary of State forthe Colonies.At their meeting on the 26th May -(Cabinet 22(37) conclusion 4) the Cabinet agreed that we should be authorised to discuss the question of union or closer association between Southern and Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland with the Prime Minister of Southern Rhodesia and representatives of Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland and that if we felt satisfied that the balance of advantage lay in investigating some form of union or closer association we should report again to the Cabinet and make further proposals.In accordance with this decision we discussed the matter with the Prime Minister of Southern Rhodesia (Dr. Huggins) at a meeting at which the   Governors of Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland, and Colonel Gore-Browne (an unofficial member of the Northern Rhodesia Legislative Council) v/ere also present.     Dr. Huggins represented that opinion in Southern Rhodesia was growing rather impatient at what seemed to be the purely negative attitude of the Government in Downing Street.     V/e always replied to theirrequests
requests for amalgamation that conditions had not altered since the declaration of policy in 1931.      They in Southern Rhodesia, however, thought that in a number of ways conditions had altered, and he was afraid that if we maintained a purely non posaumus attitude the section of opinion in Southern Rhodesia which was in favour of absorption into the Union would become steadily more powerful, and that would create a very awkward and undesirable situation.      He expressed his own view that though there was co-operation between Southern and Northern Rhodesia in some matters, co-operation under separate political systems was not likely to be very effective.      But he was quite prepared to be convinced to the contrary if some authoritative body, such as a Commission, after careful examination of the problem were to pronounce in favour of a greater measure of co-operation, or some modified form of political union short of complete amalgamation.      He urged that v/e should do something to convince people, in Southern Rhodesia that v/e were prepared to consider the matter on the merits of the situation as it existed to-day, and not as it existed in 1931.The Governors of Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland&apos; were opposed to amalgamation, but were of opinion that increased co-operation between the three Territories was desirable.      The Governor of Northern Rhodesia has since explained that the possibility of amalgamation is doing more than anything else to impede the progress of Northern Rhodesia.     He would like it made clear that there can be no question of amalgamation for 15 or 20 years, or until the Native inhabitants have expressed a wish for it.In
In further conversations with Dr. Huggins, we explained that we felt that amalgamation would not &quot;be possible at this stage. .   What might happen in the more distant future could only be a matter of speculation.      But neither Parliament nor the public here would agree to any action now which prejudiced the control which His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom at present had in regard to Native policy in Northern Rhodesia and Nyasalando     We indicated, however, that we felt that it might be possible to devise measures of closer co-operation between the Governments of Southern and Northern Rhodesia, and if necessary that of Nyasaland, and that we should be prepared to consider the possibility of the appointment of a Commission of enquiry into the problem.      It was understood that Dr. Huggins&apos; view was that he would welcome a Commission if the terms were so drawn that although the emphasis was on co-operation between the Governments, it would not be impossible for the Commission to consider and make observations on the possibility of some form of closer union if they thought that advisable.Dr. Huggins was promised that a further communicatia would be sent to him after we had been able to consult our colleagues in the Cabinet.We have now considered the matter further in the light of the discussions with him.     We think that a mere repetition of the statement that in cur view conditions had not sufficiently altered since 1931 to warrant any fresh considering of the question would only lead to considerable bad feeling, and to increased political difficulties with the europeans
Europeans in both Southern and Northern Rhodesia.     We believe that it may be possible to devise means of closer co-operation between the two Governments, and also if necessary that of Nyasaland, on many matters such as defence, transport and communications, trade and economic policy, and various other questions, and that this is for various reasons desirable. But enquiry into this must be on the strict understanding that there can he no question of his Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom modifying in any way the control which they exercise over Native policy and administration in Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland, nor the reserve powers which they possess concerning Native policy in Southern Rhodesia.     We would, therefore, propose that as the next step, a letter should be sent to Dr. Huggins in the terms of the accompanying draft.(Intld.)    M. M. (intld,)    W. 0. G.Downing Street,15th July, 1957.
draft the HONOURABLE G.M. HUGGINS;, M.P.CONFIDENTIALDowning Street, July, 1937Mr. Ormsby Gore and I undertook,, when we discussed with you in London the general question of the closer association or cc-operation of the Rhodesias and Nyasaland, to consider the matter further in consultation with our colleagues, and I promised that I would then communicate with you again on your return to Southern Rhodesia.&apos;fe have now consulted the Cabinet accordingly, and as I think you will have expected from our talks In Londons the view of the United Kingdom Government is that amalgamation of the Territories cannot be regarded as practical politics at the present time.     The Government feel that they cannotcontemplate
contemplate the relinquishment of their responsibilities in regard to the native inhabitants of Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland in their present stage of development., and indeed they are confident that any such action would be quite unacceptable to Parliament.      At the same time we should he very ready, subject to the above condition, to examine the possibility of extending association or co-operation between the Territories in other matters and by other means.      Such an investigation need not necessarily exclude thepossibility
possibility of closer association in the political sphere, though it must be admitted that any form of closer political association between a self-governing Colony and Territories in regard to which the Secretary of State for the Colonies would continue to have a special responsibility to Parliament, would appear to be very difficult, if not impossible, to devise.When we discussed the matter with you in London, the suggestion was put forward that a Commission might be appointed toadvise
advise as to how far the promotion and extension.of such closer association orcooperation was desirable  and feasible.It may be, of course,  that if actual amalgamationis excluded from the scope of such a Commissionyou may feel that the question is one, thefurther examination of which could be adequatelyundertaken.by the three Governments in consultation.If so, we should be very ready to consider any suggestions for such examination.      If,  onthe other hand, you consider that it wouldbe of value for a Commission to he sent fromthis country to report on the matter, weshould bee glad to make arrangementsaccordingly.     In that case, we feel thatit would be important to explain, in astatement attached to the actual terms ofreference of any such Commission, the generalobject and scope of its work in order thatit
HBOit might be clear from the outset that amalgamation of the Territories was not  in contemplation.   I enclose a draft showing the kind of statement and terms of reference which we think might &quot;be suitable.I should be grateful for your views on the subject as soon as you have been able to consider the matter in consultation with your colleagues.   If you should feel that there would be advantage to be gained by the appointment of a Commission from this country we should be quite prepared, in accordance with the wish you expressed in London, to let you know, before setting up the Commission, whom we had in mind as its members. Our present view is that it might suitably consist of, say, five persons,  of whom three would be Members of Parliament representative of the principal Parties.   It would hardly be practicable, I imagine,  for a Commission to leave until after Christmas, and it would seem desirablethat

that before they present a report they should have available the reports of the Economic Commissions which are proceeding to Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland,  and also Lord Haileyrs report on his African survey.    These reports should be available, I hope,  early next year.I am writing to you semi-officially in this way in order that we may have an indication of your wishes before we send any official communication.     We would propose to place our views on record later in an official despatch.Mr. Ormsby Gore is sending a copy of this letter to Sir Hubert Young and Sir Harold Kittermaster for their personal information but he does not propose to take any furthe r action as regards Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland until we have heard from you.   A copy of this letter is being sent privately to Sir Herbert Stanley also for his information.
I.t will be recalled that in 1931 His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom had under consideration the question of the relationship between Southern and Northern Rhodesia.    As announced in both Houses of Parliament on the 2nd&quot;July of that year by the Secretaries of State for Dominion Affairs and for the Colonies, the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government at that time was that for some time to come&apos;Northern Rhodesia should continue to work out its destiny as a separate entity, observing the closest possible co-ordination with its neighbours, and especially with Southern Rhodesia.In the course of the last few months His Majesty&apos;s Government have had the opportunity of discussing with the Prime Minister of Southern Rhodesia, -with-the Governor and two unofficial members of the Legislative Council of Northern Rhodesia, and with the Governor of Nyasaland, the position as it.has developed since the announcement of 1931 was made.As the result of these discussions His Majesty&apos;s Government have reached the conclusion that subject to the maintenance.of their responsibility, as it now stands in each of the three Territories concerned, for the interests.of the native inhabitants, consideration should be given in detail to the possibility of the further promotion of closer oo-operation or association between Southern Rhodesia,Northern
Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland.    Some of the subjects which suggest themselves for examination are transport and communications, scientific and technical research and services, labour, especially the inter-territorial migration of labour, trade and economic policy, judicial arrangements, defence, and, so far as international obligations affecting the Territories permit, customs duties.In accordance with the wishes of the Government of Southern Rhodesia, and after - consultation with the Governors of Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland, Eis Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom propose to advise His Majesty to appoint a Royal Commission to visit the Territories concerned.    The terms of reference of the Commission will be as follows to enquire and   report whether any, and if so what, form of closer co-operation or association between Southern Rhodesia, Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland is desirable and feasible, with due regard to the interests of the European and native inhabitants of the Territories concerned and to the maintenance of the responsibility, as it now stands in each of the three Territories, of His Majesty1s Government in the United Kingdom for the interests of the native inhabitants.
