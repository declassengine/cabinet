Printed for the Cabinet. ; July 1937.SECRET.Copy No.43CP. 180 (37).CABINET.BRITISH EXTRA-TERRITORIAL RIGHTS IN MOROCCO.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.ARTICLE 2 of the secret articles annexed to the Declaration of the 8th April, 1904, between the United Kingdom and France respecting Egypt and Morocco provides that in the event of His Majesty&apos;s Government considering it desirable to introduce in Egypt reforms tending to assimilate the Egyptian legis-lative system to that in force in other civilised countries, the French Government will not refuse to entertain any such proposals, on the understanding that His Majesty&apos;s Government will agree to entertain the suggestions that the French Government have, to make to them with a view to introducing similar reforms in Morocco.British extra-territorial rights in Morocco have proved a useful lever in preventing discriminatory measures by the authorities of the French Zone of Morocco against British trade and interests, and His Majesty&apos;s Government have hitherto been reluctant to agree to their surrender, unless such action was forced upon them. On the conclusion of the recent Treaty of Alliance between the United Kingdom and Egypt, with its provision for the eventual surrender of foreign capitulatory rights in Egypt, it was realised that the French Government would inevitably put forward a demand for the surrender of British extra-territorial rights in the French Zone of Morocco and that His Majesty&apos;s Government were under an obligation to entertain French proposals to this end if the French Government agreed to surrender their capitulatory rights in Egypt. Any refusal by His Majesty&apos;s Government would, indeed, have involved the refusal of the French Government to participate in the convention which they and other Governments signed at Montreux on the 8th May, 1937, for the abolition of foreign Capitulations in Egypt.In January 1937 M. Vienot, the French Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs, stated at Geneva that he proposed to raise with His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Paris the question of Capitulations in Morocco, pointing out that, as Egypt was about to liberate herself from the capitulatory regime, it was only fair that Morocco should do likewise; the system was out of date and unsuited to modern conditions and was a source of serious embarrassment to the French Protectorate authorities.Accordingly, steps were taken by the Foreign Office to draw up the terms on which British extra-territorial rights in the French Zone of Morocco should be surrendered. The basis which has been adopted is to confine the rights to be surrendered, subject to certain safeguards, to extra-territorial rights proper, retaining intact British commercial and economic privileges now enjoyed under the treaties in force. So far as His Majesty&apos;s Government are concerned, they have no desire that commercial matters should be raised, but if, as a result of French insistence, it becomes necessary to consider them, such matters must form the subject of separate negotiations.9355   [15518]
Last March unofficial discussions took place with officials of the French Government at which (i) the attitude to be adopted by the French and British Governments to the Egyptian proposals for the Montreux Conference for the abolition of the Capitulations in Egypt, and (ii) the question of the abolition of British extra-territorial rights in Moroccowere discussed. The French Government were informed that His Majesty&apos;s Government were prepared to negotiate a convention setting out the conditions on which they were prepared to surrender British extra-territorial rights in Morocco, and a draft convention containing His Majesty&apos;s Governments provisional desiderata was handed to the French. Since that date the Montreux Conference has been completed and the French have signed the convention for the abolition of the Capitulations in Egypt. The French have now asked for negotiations for the conclusion of a convention with regard to Morocco to be opened and it has been agreed that such negotiations shall be begun at the Foreign Office on the 12th July. The Board of Trade, Colonial Office and Dominion Governments have been kept fully informed of these developments.The position has been discussed recently between representatives of the Foreign Office and the Board of Trade and a delegation of British commercial interests concerned, and the proposals which have been drawn up for the purpose of the negotiations take account of the various points raised by the delegation so far as they are compatible with the basis outlined above.The effect of these proposals is shown in the Annex.A. E.Foreign Office, July 7, 1937.ANNEX.1. British subjects, British-protected persons, British companies and British ships and aircraft to be subject to the same jurisdiction and legislation as French citizens, &amp;c, with certain safeguards against retroactive application to British subjects, &amp;c, of French legislation not hitherto applied to them.2. British subjects, British-protected persons, British companies and British ships and aircraft to be treated on a footing of equality with French citizens, &amp;c, without discrimination in administrative action or otherwise.3. British consular jurisdiction in matters of personal status to be retained for, a transitional period of twelve years, on the same lines as the relevant provisions in the Montreux Convention of the 8th May, 1937.4. Existing British proteges (Semsars, i.e., Moroccan agents of British firms, and British consular employees) to continue to enjoy British protection for the rest of their lives.5. British schools to continue to enjoy the same liberty as hitherto, and British missionaries to be treated as favourably as French missionaries.6. The opportunity is also being taken to include provision to subject French citizens, &amp;c, in Zanzibar to the same jurisdiction and legislation as British subjects, &amp;c, with similar safeguards as to non-discrimination as in the case of British subjects in the French Zone of Morocco, and to confine the privileges and immunities of French consuls in Zanzibar to those enjoyed by French consular officers in the United Kingdom.
