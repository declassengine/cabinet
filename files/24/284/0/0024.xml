        (THIS  DOCUMENT  IS  THE  PROPERTY  OP      HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;S  GOVERNMENT).SECRET.      1.  The fullest use has now been made of existinghospital accommodation by introducing additional beds andby upgrading institutions not at present equipped for surgicalwork.   By these expedients and by sending existing sick totheir homes or to inferior accommodation about 200,000 bedswill be provided in England and Wales for. civilian casualties in the first 24 hours and another 100,000 a week or so later.But these figures include about 80,000 beds in vulnerablesituations which could probably only be used for clearingstation purposes.   Further, the sick displaced - about140,000 - would soon be succeeded by others requiring hospital treatment for the ordinary illnesses.   Thus in England andWales there are only about 80,000 beds on which we can count forthe prolonged treatment of casualties.      2.  In Scotland the position is even less satisfactory.About 12,000 beds could be provided for civilian casualties in the first 24 hours, and about 8,000 more a week or solater. .  But of this total of 20,000 beds some 50 per cent.are situated in vulnerable areas, and something like afurther 10,000 would be needed to accommodate cases of ordinary illness, succeeding the cases of sickness displacedon the occurrence of the emergency.CP.77(59).COPY0 A B I N E ToEMERGENCY  HOSPITAL  ORGANISATION. Memorandum by the Minister of health and the Secretary of State for Scotland.
      3.  In both countries the existing provision  of bedsis therefore inadequate.    No one can forecast  with accuracythe number and location of civilian casualties.   But we havebeen advised by the Minister for Co-ordination  of Defence thatin Great Britain as a whole air raid casualties in  the  first two or three weeks might be as high as 17,500 killed and35,000 wounded every day.   On this basis 433,000 beds  mightbe required by the fourth week.      4.  It would not be possible to provide hospital accommodation on any modern basis for such a number of casulties.   The task of construction could not be completed within any reasonable time, and there would not be  enoughdoctors or nurses to serve so many beds even if they were provided.      5.  By agreement with the Chancellor of the Exchequerand the Lord Privy Seal, we are already proceeding  to  approach the hospital authorities with a view to the construction, on land adjoining their institutions, of huts which wouldaccommodate 20,000 beds in selected parts of England and Wales(primarily to serve London, Birmingham and Tyneside) and 6,000in Scotland (primarily to serve Edinburgh and Glasgow)  at an estimated cost of  70 per bed for construction  and   10  per  bedfor bedding and ward equipment.   A further review  is,  however,desirable.      6.  The calculations mentioned above do not take accountof hospital accommodation required for -          (a) Service casualties and sick brought              back from overseas,          (b) Service sick, not being air raid              casualties, in this Country.These Service requirements must be treated as additional tothose for the civilian population.
      7.  The fact that some additional accommodation will heneeded for Service requirements raises also a question ofprinciple, viz. whether the Service Departments should themselvesundertake the necessary construction or whether, on the otherhand, the Service and civilian requirements should both be met from a. joint pool of hutted accommodation, units of which mightbe transferred to the Services if and when the need arises.In our view the latter is the preferable course, in the interestsof economy and uniformity of administration, as the organisationof the additional accommodation required v/ould then be under one central authority.   In particular, this method would keepmedical and nursing personnel employed to the best advantage and would avoid the immobilizing of some skilled personnel in service institutions, where they might not immediately berequired, at a time when the civilian accommodation was being subjected to maximum strain.      8.  We suggest therefore -          (a) that approval be given to the              principle of unified control of              all the emergency hospital              accommodation, whether for              civilian or Service requirements,              in this country, and          (b) that a committee of Ministers be              set up- to consider the extent to              which additional accommodation              ought to be provided.31st March, 1939.(Intd.)
