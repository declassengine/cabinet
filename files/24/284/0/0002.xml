(C.I.D. Paper No. D.P. (P.) 46.)    (Previous reference : C.I.D. Minutes of the 335th Meeting, Minute (1).)    THE COMMITTEE had  under consideration a  Memorandum by the  FirstLord  of  the  Admiralty on  Future Capital Ship Strength  (C.I.D. Paper No.D.P. (P.) 46).    LORD STANHOPE said that the German  Government had  asked for fiveyears&apos; notice  of capital ship strength, but would probably accept our suggestionthat we should give them a  forecast of the position as it would be on the 31stDecember,  1943,  immediately  after the  announcement  of  our 1939 building programme.  We had  already told Germany that our capital ship strength atthe end of 1942 would be  19 ships.  If we kept to the same total for  1943, itwould entail  the scrapping of one of the &quot; Royal Sovereign &quot; class in 1942 andthree in 1943.    On the one hand, the Naval Staff were anxious to replace the oldest capital ships which, owing to their lack of deck and under-water protection, were unde-sirably vulnerable, both to gun and air attack as  well as to mines and torpedoes.These ships also had tactical disadvantages as regards speed and radius of action.&apos;On the other hand, any public announcement that it was proposed to scrap capital ships at this juncture would arouse a great deal of criticism.   The Admiralty feltthat if we informed the Germans  that we were only retaining  19  ships, but didnot tell the public, that we were scrapping our older ships, the Germans wouldprobably doubt our bona fides.  The Admiralty had therefore suggested for con-sideration a compromise plan, whereb)^ we announced that we intended to  scrapone capital ship in 1942, and one in 1943, i.e., the replacement of each old ship by two new ones.  We would give Germany a capital ship tonnage for 1943 whichwould be equivalent to 21 ships.    SIR ROGER BACKHOUSE said that the Admiralty were anxious to keepthe total of German ships  as  low as possible, but did not feel entirely happyabout the strength of the possible Fleet to operate in the Far East.  As wouldbe seen from the table in Appendix  II, it would be to our advantage, as regardsvis-a-vis Japan, to retain the old ships.       [18712-1]
2    LORD  HALIFAX  asked if the judgment of  the  Admiralty had been influenced in any way by the  possibility of Herr Hitler denouncing, the Naval.Agreement.    SIR ROGER BACKHOUSE pointed out that such action would, in any,case, not affect the position during the next few years.    LORD  CHATFIELD appreciated that the Admiralty were faced with avery difficult problem.  From the technical point of view the unmodernised &apos;&apos; RoyalSovereign &quot;  class were of little value as part of the battle fleet, but they wouldhave considerable value for use as convoy escorts, or  against the &quot; Deutschlands.&quot;They could also probably make good showing against the&quot; German battle cruisers.    As regards  public criticism of any considerable  scrapping,  the  Committeewould remember the storm that was caused by the scrapping of the &apos;&apos; Iron Duke &apos;&apos;class and the &quot; Tiger,&quot;  in 1930, and,  more recently,  the public outcry againstthe scrapping of five &quot;C&quot; class cruisers.    THE PRIME MINISTER  said that he was in no doubt as to the criticism which would be aroused if we announced the proposed scrapping of so many ships.    LORD  CHATFIELD remarked that Herr Ribbentrop, when in this countryfor the  signing  of  the  Anglo-German Naval  Agreement, had  asked for an assurance, which was  on record, that  we had  no intention of so reducing ourown Navy  that  the  Germany  Navy, in accordance with the Treaty, would bereduced  to  an insignificant  size.  As  regards  the retention of additional shipsgiving Germany the  right  to build another capital  ship,  he,  personally, was inclined  to doubt whether the Germans would actually lay down an  extra ship.    SIR ROGER BACKHOUSE pointed out that  Herr Hitler had stated cate-gorically, when launching the  battleship Bismarck,  that he intended to build upto the full 35 per cent, of our strength.    After some further  discussion, it  was agreed that the compromise plan, as suggested by the First Lord of the Admiralty, should be approved.                                CONCLUSIONS.    THE COMMITTEE OF  IMPERIAL DEFENCE  agreed     (a) To  approve the compromise plan for the future capital ship strength as           put forward in the Memorandum by the  First Lord of the Admiralty           (C.I.D. Paper No. D.P. (P.) 46), namely-           (i) That, with regard to the estimated tonnage of British capital ships    ,  :           on the 31st  December, 1943, the  German Government should                 be given a figure corresponding to the tonnage of 21 ships.          (ii) That,  in the announcement of  our 1939 building programme, it                 should be stated that we intended to scrap one of the &quot;Royal                 Sovereign &quot;  class in the year 1942 on the completion of the last                 ship of the 1937 programme, and  one in 1943 on completion of                 the 1938 programme of capital ships.    (b) That the above conclusion should be brought to the notice of the Cabinet.          *          *          *         *          *          *Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,    February 24, 1939.

(Previous C.I.D. Paper No. D.P. (P.) 35.)              Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty.    I CIRCULATE this Memorandum on the future strength of the british fleet in capital ships for the consideration of the Committee of Imperial Defence.    I feel  that there will be considerable  public criticism if we  announce thescrapping of the 5 &quot; Royal Sovereign &quot; class of battleships, particularly when itis realised  that this reduces our strength in capital ships below the strength ofGermany and  Japan.    I suggest  therefore that the wisest  solution of this difficult problem is that proposed in paragraph 16, viz., that commencing in  1942 we should scrap one&apos;&apos; Royal Sovereign &apos;&apos; class battleship as  two new battleships  are completed.                                                       (Initialled)       S.    Admiralty, S.W. 1,        February  18,  1939.ENCLOSURE.                       Future Capital Ship  Strength.    IN October 1938 the Committee of Imperial  Defence* accepted (and theCabinet approved) t  the Admiralty recommendations for a forecast of Britishstrength in  capital ships  on the 31st December, 1942, to be communicated toGermany.  This forecast comprised 19 ships and allowed for the scrapping ofthree  battleships  of  the &apos;&apos; Royal Sovereign &apos;&apos;  Class before  the  31st  December,1942.   The details of this recommendation and the reasons therefor are given inD.P. (P.) 35 of the 17th October,  1938.    2.  After this forecast had been received the German Government requested the British  Government to give further  consideration to the method by whichforecasts of Britsh  Naval strength after 1942 (a matter not dealt with in the        * C.I.D./33oth Meeting, Minute 1.        f Cabinet 50 (38), Conclusion II.       [18688]
Anglo-German Naval Agreement) should  be  communicated to Germany, and pressed for a forecast to follow the announcement of each British annual building programme giving the British tonnage in each category of ship for five years inadvance.   It was represented that, as it took Germany nearly five years to design and build capital ships, a forecast from Great Britain for five years in advance was necessary, under the 35 per cent. Agreement, to enable Germany to use to thefull her permitted quota of  tonnage.  In reply to this request,  it was suggested to the German Government that, to meet the reasonable German requirements, a forecast should be given to Germany immediately after the announcement  of theBritish 1939 building programme, of the estimated tonnage of British capital ships on the 31st  December, 1943,  and of  all other  categories of ship  on the31st  December, 1942.  The  German Government  have not  yet replied to thissuggestion, although it appeared during the Naval conversations in Berlin  on the30th December, 1938, that the British proposal was probably  acceptable.    3.  The British building programme  for 1939 was communicated  to theGerman Embassy in accordance with the Naval Treaty on the 7th February.  Ithas therefore become necessary to decide on the figure of capital ship  strength onthe 31st December,  1943, which we should now be prepared to communicate toGermany.    4. A further  point has  also arisen.   Germany  was informed  in  October1938 that our  strength in capital ships at the end of  1942 would be 19 ships, adecision which entailed the scrapping of three &quot; Royal Sovereign &quot; Class battle-ships on completion of the last ship of the 1937 programme and the two ships ofthe 1938 programme, which at that time was expected to be before the end of 1942.Owing to the longer time required to complete the  new ships  it  is not now expected  that the ships of the 1938 programme will be ready before 1943.   Conse-quently, only one  &apos;&apos; Royal Sovereign &apos;&apos; Class would need  to be scrapped in 1942in order to keep to  our notified number of capital ships at the end of that year.The position is shown in Appendix III.    No decision as regards  the scrapping of battleships has yet been conununi-cated to Parliament.  Sooner or later the decision must be made public, and until this is done the German Government will remain doubtful whether our notifiedintentions will be  loyally observed.   Moreover, the longer the  announcement isdelayed the more likely is the policy to be criticised in this country and complaintsmade that it was not made known.    5.  It is now for decision whether     (a) the number of British capital ships at the end of 1943 should be 19, which          entails  scrapping all  five of the &apos;&apos; Royal  Sovereign&apos;&apos;  Class  by the          date that the last ship of the 1939 building programme is completed;    (&amp;) Parliament should be informed of this decision when  the Naval Estimates          are introduced.   See (D.P. (P.) 35,  para. 23).    6.  It is realised that at this time of international tension an announcement that it has been decided  to scrap these ships may arouse opposition in parliament and in the  Country, and such a decision will require  full justification.  Thereasons which led the Admiralty to recommend the figure of  19 ships for the endof 1942 were explained in D.P. (P.) 35.  The same reasons hold good for the endof 1943.    7.  Briefly, the choice lies between retaining  19  ships which would  entitleGermany  to 6 modern battleships plus the 3 &quot; Deutschland &quot; Class, or 22 ships,including three of the &quot; Royal Sovereign &quot;  Class,  which would entitle Germanyto 7 modern battleships plus 3 &quot;Deutschland &quot; Class.    8.  If it was decided that 22 ships would be the better choice for 1943, then the figure 19 for the end of  1942, already communicated to Germany, could stillstand, as already explained in paragraph 4 above.    9.  As explained in DP. (P.) 35, to select the figure 21  or 20 for the  end of1943  would give Germany a claim, which probably could not be resisted  by  us,to construct the same amount of tonnage as if we had 22 ships.    10.  The  ships comprising our battle fleets on the completion of our 1938and  1939 programme, on the  supposition that we retain either 19 or 22 ships,are given in Appendix I.   The Admiralty problem is so to divide these ships
that we can match the divided fleets of Germany and Japan.   If we keep 22ships instead of 19 we allow Germany an  additional new ship which has to be matched by withdrawing one of our new ships from our potential Eastern fleet.    NOTE. The possible division of our  ships into two fleets to match the fleets        of Germany  and Japan  on the  completion  of the  1938  and 1939        programmes is given for purposes of comparison in Appendix II.    The  theoretical comparison for these two  figures depends therefore  on the answer to the question whether it is preferable to include one new capital shipor three &quot; Eoyal Sovereign &quot; Class ships in our Far Eastern fleet.  This is verydifficult to answer, but when  all considerations  are  taken into account theAdmiralty consider that the balance of advantage lies in favour  of the one newship and a total of 19.    11.  The advantages  of  retaining. 22 ships  by  retaining  the &quot;EoyalSovereign &quot; Class, apart from an actual increase in numbers, would be :     (a) their value in  roles such as escorts for important convoys;    (&amp;) the smaller the number of capital ships the less is the margin available          for refits, large repairs or for replacing casualties in war.   These          ships Avould be available  to take the  crews and the place of more          modern ships temporarily  out of action;    (c) their political value as existing capital  ships is considerable.   Their          exact state  can never be known to our potential enemies and so long          as they continue to  exist they may  be  counted by foreign Powers  as          powerful ships  which may form part  of  our battle fleet.    12.  The disadvantages of retaining the &quot; Royal Sovereign &quot;  Class  are :     (a) the retention of one, two  or  three of these ships would  allow Germany          to build one additional new ship;    (&amp;) experience has shown  that it does  not pay to  keep old  ships beyond  a          certain life because of their steady deterioration.  For  capital ships          the accepted life is  26 years and the &quot; Royal Sovereigns &quot;  reach this          age in  1942 and 1943.  Only Royal Oak of this class  has been recon-          structed  and given  a thorough  large repair since  completion.  The          three  &quot; Warspites &quot; and the 2  &quot;  Barhams,&quot; although, older, have          been reconstructed, and the former re-engined, at a cost  varying from            2,900,000  to  1,037,100 per  ship.   This  work necessitated each          ship being  withdrawn  from service for a period varying  from 2^ to          3f years.  It would not  be  advisable to take  any  of the &quot; Royal          Sovereign &quot; Class in hand before the latter part of 1940;    (c) these ships are 2 to  3  knots slower than the next slowest of our ships          (&quot; Nelson &quot; Class) and thus reduce the operational speed  of the fleet          of which they form a part;     (d) their endurance at high speeds is considerably  less than that  of the next          class (&quot; Barham &quot;);    (e) they  are lacking both  in horizontal protection and resistance to under-          water attack.  They are, therefore, more  vulnerable both  to gun and          air attack  as well as to mines and torpedoes;    (/) the earlier scrapping of  &quot; R &quot;  class battleships would make available          15-inch gun turrets which could be modernised for use  in new ships,          thus  enabling us to accelerate our  construction of new capital ships          in the  future if necessary;     (g) the annual cost of retaining 3 &apos;&apos; Royal Sovereign &quot; Class  ships in  reserve          is of the order of  650,000;     (h) an increase in Vote  A would be  necessary and even  so there  would          probably be difficulty  in  manning these  three  ships adequately  in          war.   This will depend largely on the success of recruiting in  certain          branches during  the next few years.  The  state of  training and          efficiency of a ship  coming from reserve,  with a large proportion of          reserve ratings, cannot  approach  that  of  a  ship which has been          maintained in commission.     13.  It may also  be pointed out that since each &quot;Royal  Sovereign&quot; Classwill be retained until the  new ship  relieving  her is completed  (i.e., after com-       [18688]                                         &apos;            B 2
pletion of trials) before she is taken in hand for scrapping, we should always have as a margin 1 or 2  ships nearly complete or 1 or 2 ships that have only recently been taken in hand for scrapping.    14.  While the  Admiralty would much prefer to have a larger number ofcapital ships, the immediate choice lies between scrapping old ships or givingGermany the right to build up a larger Fleet of new ones.  As stated, old ships,uhmodernised,  cannot be  depended upon to withstand  modern scales of attack.This is fully borne  out by war experience.    If it is  decided to retain the  &quot; Royal Sovereigns&quot; so as to have  22  ships at the end of 1943,  the Admiralty will wish  to take steps in 1940 to  do whatis practicable to improve  the protection of at least two of them, especially overthe magazines,  without laying them up for  longer  than can be  avoided; butthis must take time and will cost approximately  1,250,000 per ship.    15.  Taking all the  above factors into account  the Admiralty are of theopinion that it is better to scrap these ships during 1942, 1943 and 1944, as thenew ships are completed,  so that the strength of our fleet from the end of 1942to the end of 1943 will be 19 ships.    16.  As mentioned in paragraph 6 above, it is realised that the announcementof a decision to scrap all 5 &apos;&apos;&apos; Royal Sovereign &apos;&apos; Class  by  the completion of the1939 programme may arouse strong criticism in the country.  Such criticism couldbe based on a purely numerical comparison of our capital ship fleet with the total numbers of those belonging to or building for  the two Powers with whom weseem most likely to come into conflict, without regard to other factors. A possiblecompromise, presenting a less alarming picture, might be to announce our intentionto scrap one of the  &quot; Royal Sovereign &quot; Class each year, beginning in the year1942, on the completion of the last ship of the &quot; King George V &quot; Class.    17.  The result of this policy would be that at  the end of 1942 we shouldhave 19 ships (as explained in paragraph 4 above);  at the end of  1943 we shouldhave 21 ships;  and. at the end of 1944 we should have 22 or more ships, accordingto the number to be included  in the 1940 building programme.  The last of the&quot; Royal Sovereign &quot; Class would not be scrapped until 1946.    18.  We should have to announce to the German Government now that at theend of 1943 we should have a tonnage which would be  based on 21 ships.  Thiswould entitle the Germans to build the extra ship that would result from  a Britishtotal  of 22.  If their productive  power is sufficient,  they would  thus be able to begin construction of this ship a year earlier than if we announced  the figure of19 ships.    19.  This compromise plan has this much more to be said for it. It is morelogical as it provides for the  gradual replacement of old ships.  It is also more likely to be acceptable to Germany, as it  gives us less chance of adding to thestrength of the Fleet by the simple process of withholding scrapping.    It is not, however, one which the Admiralty would select except for exceptionalreasons, and they wish particularly to stress the importance of nothing interfering with a steady programme of construction of new capital ships. :    Admiralty, S.W. 1,         February 18, 1939.
