(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRET                                               COPY NO. &amp;*fCP. 61(19).                            CABINET                     AIR RAID PRECAUTIONS BILL.                        Financial Provisions.                 Memorandum by the Lord Privy Seal.     1.      The draft of this Bill,  which has  been discussed with     the Civil Defence (Policy)  Sub-Committee  of the Committee of     Imperial  Defence, will in due course come before the Cabinet     through the Home Affairs Committee, but I think it desirable     to  submit separately to the Cabinet certain major matters of     principle affecting the financial implications  of the Bill,     which imposes new obligations on industrial and commercial     establishments that will cost money, and  interferes with     private  rights in buildings and houses.          The  Bill represents measures which are all necessary and     urgently  necessary for the proper development of Civil Defence.     2.    Industrial Establishments.          It  is now generally accepted that there is a moral     obligation on employers to protect their  workpeople.  Indeed     this  is  the most important aspect of the  shelter problem, for     it  covers the protection of vital workers at their work.          The  Bill requires industrial establishments in which more     than  fifty persons are employed          (l)   to organise air raid precautions and  to provide               training and protective equipment for some of               their workpeople, and
                                                           7 \                                                           it -      (2)     to provide protective  shelter  for  their             workpeople,,      The  first requirement  is  not  expensive  and by theChancellor&apos;s statement of the  18th March,  1938, of whicha copy  is attached,  the  expenditure  on it  would bedeductible as a  trading  expense for  purposes of incometax  and national defence contribution.      The  second  obligation  will be defined by  a code  of strict ral protection which  gives a varied  choice  of types of protection suitable for  various types of  industrial establishments.   Expenditure  on this item would  only heallowable in rare&apos;cases, e.g.  where  the protection took the  form  of  movable  steel shelters.      On the  best information available the cost per headfor  protection which the code  will lay down  should notexceed   4 for units  of fifty,  though this  figure  might be exceeded  in  the  case of certain vital establishments.3*    Commercial  Establishments.      The  owners  of commercial  buildings i,e. shops and offices,  in  which more than fifty  persons  are  employed, willhave  a  similar obligation,  both with regard  to training and provision of  shelter.      In the  case  of  commercial establishments  occupyingwhat  can  best be described  as  office accommodation, thereis power  in  the  Bill for the owner to charge to the tenants,by alteration in the rent,  the cost  of protection, and the tenants can  in turn  charge  the increased rent  as  a tradingexpense and will therefore  in  effect receive a financial contribution  to  the  cost.4*    Rep.trietion^ to Vulnerable^ Area.s0     The Minister will have power under the Bill  to exempt from the  statutory obligations any premises or buildings inany area.     It is important in my  opinion  to do everything possible
r11is  ;-jto concentrate upon protective measures and the organisation ofair raid precautions in the more vulnerable areas.5.     Attitude of the Industrial Panel.     The Industrial Panel, recognising that the major items inthis obligation extend to physical protection for workpeopleinvolving structural operations which, being on capital account,would not be allowable as a trading expense, pressed very strongly that the whole of the A.R.P. expenditure incurred byindustrial and commercial undertakings should be chargeable tothe year in which it is incurred, and that, in order to purchaseacceleration, this concession should be limited to work effectively begun.or completed during the year 1959/40.     This method would make the relief dependent upon theearning of profits and would, I am certain, be attacked, forexample, by industries such as the cotton textile trade and.others, and for this and other reasons I cannot support it.  Iam convinced, however, that some relief towards the burden ofthis expenditure  is necessary.   The success of the Bill depends upon the speed with which these protective measures are under-taken, and this in turn depends upon the goodwill of employersand their organisations.     I am satisfied therefore that financial assistance on thescale recommended by the Panel, of an amount at least equivalentto income tax remission, should be provided, and that it should extend to commercial as well as industrial undertakings, except to the extent to which there is already provision in the Billfor passing on costs to the tenants of offices.   It would automatically extend also to the cost of the &quot;Good Employers&apos;Code&quot; in public utility undertakings, to the extent that this expenditure is not already covered by the Chancellor&apos;s State-ment.
i 0      I  do  not  regard it  as  practicable  to confine  the financial assistance to  those  undertakings  upon whom  the  statutory obligation rests.    I do not  think  the  obligation  itself need be  extended to units of  a smaller size  than I have described; but I think that, where  other commercial and industrial establishments take  measures  for  the protection of their workpeople which are on  capital account, similar financial assistance must be given to them.   I should however hope that, just as  the statutory obligation  would not generally be  put  upon industrial and commercial establishments in non-vulnerable  areas,  similarly the subsidy  would not be payable to such undertakings.   We do not wish  to encourage extravagance in protective measures in  areas not exposed to  risk of attack.      I  should  also hope  to be  able to put a  financial limit. upon  the expenditure  per head  of  persons employed against which a subsidy might be paid  though I  am bound to say that there may  be cases,  notably of undertakings  carrying on work  of vital  importance in exceptionally vulnerable areas, where it would be very difficult  from the standpoint of equity  to  justify the  application of a uniform overriding limit.      If the Cabinet  accept the principles outlined in thismemorandum, detailed  plans can be elaborated in consultationwith the Treasury and Inland Revenue Department, with whom the matter has  already been discussed.      I must at this point make it clear that a subsidy extending  so widely could not be  administered unless the inland Revenue Department were prepared to collaborateto an extent beyond their normal duties.
1 /fl     The Cabinet will understand, that it is very difficult tomake any precise estimate of the cost that these provisions will involve for the Exchequer.   There are rather more than twelvemillion persons employed in industry and commerce under theUnemployment Insurance Scheme.   If all of them were covered byprotective measures at  4 per head the total cost to employers would be in the neighbourhood of fifty millions, of which rather more than a quarter would fall to be borne by the Exchequer.  Inpractice, of course, these figures will be much reduced, notonly by many small employers who will not think it worth while to take these measures, but also by the elimination of estab-lishments in non-vulnerable areas, and by the fact that many bigindustries such as coal mining and agriculture will not need tomake such expensive arrangements.   I should conjecture there-fore that the liability upon the Exchequer would be of the orderof seven to eight million pounds.6.     Obscuration of Lighting.     At the end of 1937 the Home Office were instructed by theCommittee of Imperial Defence to aim at a policy of the severestrestriction possible of lighting.   The draft Defence Regulationon this point is cast on the lines that no light must be visibleoutside a building.   The Air Ministry attach great importanceto securing as nearly as possible a complete black-out betweendusk and dawn.     In ordinary establishments obscuration of lighting can beachieved by providing darkening materials which would enabledaytime work to be conducted by ordinary lighting, or bycovering the windows and glass roofs with paint or Latex orbrown paper which would involve the use of artificiallighting, or by shielding the lights.
     Expenditure on these matters would be covered by theChancellor &apos;s statement attjached.     If a policy of obscuring lighting is to be effectiveimmediately on the outbreak of war without interruption ofproduction, it is necessary that preparations should be madein peace-time, and I propose therefore to take power in theBill to require establishments to make these preparations inadvance.     There is one problem in the obscuration of industriallighting which is of different dimensions - the obscurationof glare from blast furnaces and other continuous processes.This involves in many cases elaborate and expensive structuralwork and other forms of capital expenditure.     The iron andsteel industry have estimated that the cost, for their industry,of compliance with the present requirements would be from fourt seven million pounds, and the Imperial Chemical Industriesestimate that the cost to them would be about  500,000.     These special measures for a limited number of industriesseem to be outside the normal &quot;Good Employers&apos; Code&quot; and to beanalagous rather to the spscial measures which we are askingpublic utility undertakings to put in hand.    I think, therefore,that there should be financial assistance to those industries,and I propose that the assistance should be provided under theBill, subject to conditions to be agreed between the department and the Treasury in respect! of each industry, and with a maximum of 5O/0 of the agreed cost. .;&apos;     On the present standards of our requirements, the cost tothe Treasury should not exceed Z&apos;j,000,000, but on closerexamination with the Air Ministry ant. the industries chiefly
1Rconcerned we may fine it  practicable to reduce that standard and accordingly to reduce the cost.     It is very desirable that I should be authorised to make,at a very early date and in advance of the publication of theBill, a comprehensive statement in the House of Commons regardingthe nature of the obligations to be imposed on industrial and commercial undertakings and the fact that financial assistance will he forthcoming from the Exchequer.    This is necessary because I understand that some employers are holding backuntil the extent of their liabilities is known.    this statement would cover not only the obligations described above,but also the arrangements made some time ago with firms working on Government contract on a costed basis for the service departments by which the cost of air raid precautions measures taken by them is carried into the price of their contracts overa two-year period.   In the case of firms which are engagedpartly on Government contract and partly on private work, these arrangements will have to be dovetailed into the scheme for relief outlined in this memorandum.7-   Compensation.     The Bill gives power to a local authority to  &quot;designate&quot;a building or part of a building or house as a public air-raidshelter or for other A.R.P. purposes,  and to enter upon the designated premises in order to carry  out works which wouldmake the premises more suitable for  those purposes.     Appeal against designation can be  allowed on  the groundthat the premises are required as  a private shelter  or thatthey are required for purposes of  public  importance.    The                             7-
1 ^t  8Bill contains an additional safeguard for premises of public utilities and other vital establishments.    But no appealis allowed in any case on grounds of personal inconvenienceor temporary loss of trade.      Local authorities have pressed very strongly for thesepov/ers as a result of their difficulties, during and sincethe crisis, in obtaining access to buildings.   without these powers the preparation of public air-raid shelters wouldbe gravely impeded.    x recognise that these are drasticpowers for peace-time, but I am satisfied that it is essentialthat these powers should be available if due progress is to beachieved with those preparations which must be made in advanceof an emergency.     As the Bill stands, the occupier of the premises receivescompensation for interference with his use of the premises,but only on the basis of a fair rent for the premises overthe period during which the works are carried out^  he doesnot receive compensation for disturbance or loss.     A further clause provides that on the making  of anorder by the Minister on the imminence of an emergency, thelocal authority may take possession of designated premises,and the Office of Works may take possession of any premisesneeded for use by the Government Departments in view of thepossibility of air attack.     In the case of   requisitioning the Bill lays down that compensation will be payable on the basis of the rentwhich the hypothetical tenant would pay for the premises inthe condition in which they were at the time of requisitioning.     I have no doubt as I have already said that th^se powersof designation and of requisitioning are necessary and that ifI am to be satisfied that a transition from peace-time to war-time conditions in Civil Defence can be effected smoothly and
in time, the pow.rs should bo taken now.    But I think thatthe proposed terms of compensation raise difficulties, andI should propose therefore that compensation for interferencewith the use of a building in peace-time while a localauthority is carrying out works in it should be extended toinclude compensation for disturbance and for any properlyauthenticated loss.    The compensation payable would be agrant-aided liability of the local authority, and in practiceI believe that the cost would be much less than the principlemight indicate.    Unless we can provide for compensation onthese lines I think the chances of Parliament accepting theclause would be very slender indeed. -                                          ing     As regards compensation for requisition/in the event ofan emergency, I think we must abandon any attempt to settle the basis of compensation now, and say merely that thecompensation for requisitioning in time of emergency would bein accordance with terms to be determined by Parliament atthe time.    We are not announcing now the basis of compensation in war-time for loss of life or for damage to property by enemy action;  we are asking Parliament and the public to accept theview that those terms would be fixed as fairly to private interests and the national interest as the situation at thetime might permit.    I see no reason why a similar policy should not be adopted in respect of compensation for the requisitioning of buildings for national purposes.8.   Local Authorities.     The Bill gives local authorities some powers for whichthey have asked and gives them some more work, mainly administra-tive.   It puts one new specific duty upon them, to do thework upon the strutted private casements, using the material which they will be given free.    The cost of the work will be
grant-aided, and in a number of areas the Government will soon be paying 83A of the cost of air raid precautions.     The authorities may take this new obligation as an excuse for raising the general question of finance for air raidprecautions.   Although it was understood, and the Actindicates this, that a review of the financial basis would beundertaken towards the end of a three-year period, the costof air raid precautions to the local authorities is provingmuch heavier than had been indicated to them when the Actwas under discussion, and they may plead that a new situation has arisen.     I would resist any such claims, but I thought mycolleagues should know that I expect the local authorities may make the new Bill the occasion for raising this matterinside and outside Parliament.J.A.3rd March, 1929.
            EXTRACT FROM PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES                     HOUSE Off COMMONS.                 Friday, 18th March, 1958.            Air Rcid Precautions;   Income Tax     The Question oi the extent to which expenditure on air-raidprecautions may be admissible as a deduction in computing tradingprofits for Income Tax purposes is primarily one for therespective bodies of Income Tax Commissioners, to be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Income Tax Acts.   Sofar as the Board of Inland Revenue are concerned, the treatment which, in their view, would be appropriate to the various classesof expenditure which a trader might incur is indicated below.It will be appreciated that it is not possible on such a subject-matter to give more than general outlines;  the particularapplication will depend upon the particular facts of differentcases.     1.  Expenditure on such items as the following would bedeductible:          (a)civilian duty and service respirators]          (b) protective clothing for staff engaged on             air-raid precautionary duties]          (c) the training of employees in such duties]          (d) covering of glass with wire netting]          (e) dark blinds, screens and paint to render             windows opaque]          (f) equipment and stores for first aid parties]          (g) equipment of decontamination squads.     2.  A wear and tear allowance would be due in respect of equipment in the nature of plant and machinery, such as fireappliances and air filtration plant.
     5. No deduction would be allowable in respect of expenditureof a capital nature, for example, expenditure which results inthe physical alteration of, or in the incorporation of additions to, the structure of the trading premises.   The Board, however,would not be disposed to regard as within this categoryexpenditure on items such as steel shutters for protection ofwindows or timber frames and screens to provide air locks atdoors or windows, y/hich are not part of the permanent structurebut represent fixtures or fittings required and used only forthe emergency, and they would not object if the Commissionersallowed deduction of such expenditure.
