Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.    I CIRCULATE to my colleagues records of three conversations  with theFrench Minister for Foreign Affairs which took place during the visit of the  xFrench President to London.Record of an Anglo-French Conversation held in the Secretary of State&apos;s Room             at the  Foreign  Office, on March 21, 1939, at 5 P.M.    Lord  Halifax first  gave M. Bonnet  an account of  recent developments inGerman-Roumanian relations, as reported by the Roumanian Minister in London,and as subsequently modified by enquiries in Bucharest.    M. Bonnet said that the French Government had had similar information.    He then went on  to give an account  of various recent conversations he had had with diplomatic representatives in Paris.    In discussing  the situation with the Roumanian Ambassador in Paris, thequestion of Russia had been  touched on.   The Roumanian Ambassador explainedthat Russia was not popular in Roumania, particularly among the upper classes,some of whom preferred Herr Hitler to Stalin.  To this, M. Bonnet had repliedthat the help that Russia  might  provide,  if only in war material,  was  notH.I.Present:Lord Halifax (Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs).Mr. Strang (Foreign Office).M.

negligible.   In the case of Czecho-Slovakia, he  had been sceptical as to the effectiveness of Russian support, since Russia was remote from  the sphere ofaction and had  no common frontier  with Czeeho-Slovakia.  But there was acommon frontier between Russia and Roumania.  In the end, the RoumanianAmbassador had raised no objection to an approach being made by the FrenchGovernment to Moscow, but he begged that the French Government would not involve the Roumanian Government.  This interview had taken place on the 18thMarch.    On the same day M. Bonnet, had seen the  Soviet Ambassador, and Shavingtold him that France was prepared to help Roumania, even though she had no obligation to do so, had asked what would be the attitude of Russia.  He had notsubordinated the assistance of France to that  of other countries.  The  soviet ambassador  had given a reply  on  the 20th March  to the effect that the  best course would be to call a conference at Bucharest of the States chiefly concerned(Great Britain,  France, Poland, Turkey,  Roumania  and  the  Soviet Union)  toconsider measures for the assistance of Roumania.    To this  M. Bonnet had replied that  he did  not think Roumania would  beenthusiastic.   The important thing was to find  out what each party would give in the way of assistance.  Russian help  would be most useful if  Poland and roumania both agreed that she should give it. It was important not to frightenthese  border  States, but to proceed with caution.   What was wanted at present was not gestures, but action.  France had herself begun to employ methods  by giving her Government full powers. (At  this point  M- Bonnet stated to lord halifax  in confidence that on the previous day the  French Government had decided to mobilise one class, and that in virtue of the new powers had forbiddenthe press to make any reference to this fact.)    M. Bonnet said he had also spoken  to the Polish Ambassador on the 19thMarch. He had said that the French Government were anxious about the german advance and were disposed to do what they could to stem it.  They wished toknow  what  assistance Poland  was  prepared  to  give, w To  this  the  PolishAmbassador  had replied that the Polish-Roumanian treaty covered the case ofRussia, and not that of Germany.  He was authorised by Colonel Beck to informthe French Government :     (1) That Poland attached importance to the Franco-Polish alliance and that           if France were attacked Poland would fulfil her obligations; but that           this alliance was only valid in the case of an attack by  Germany upon           France;    (2) That M. Beck would be unable to visit Paris after his visit to London,           but hoped that this  would not be badly interpreted  in Paris since           he hoped to go later;    (3) That the most useful assistance to give to Roumania  is not to bring in           Russia but  to take  immediate action at Budapest and Bucharest.           Hungary and Roumania  had  a  common interest in stemming  the           German advance, and French and British diplomacy could act usefully           in conjunction with Poland in these two  capitals.    To this M.  Bonnet had replied  that  this  course hardly  seemed to him to be adequate, but he  would instruct  the French Ministers  in  Budapest and Bucharest accordingly.    M. Bonnet said that he had now heard  from M.  Leger that the official Polish reply about  Roumania had come in and that it was not  satisfactory, being full of reservations.  He understood that a copy of  it was to be communi- cated to him in London by the Polish Ambassador here.     M. Bonnet added that he had also  done what  he could at Washington in regard to  the neutrality legislation.  The United States Ambassador had seen him  on  the  18th March, and  as he  was  about  to telephone to  the  President, asked if there was anything M. Bonnet wanted him to say.  M. Bonnet told him that  the best thing the United States could do would be to modify the neutrality legislation.   The United  States  Ambassador  had seen  him  again on   the 20th  March, and had told him that  the President was sure of his majority in favour of  the modification of that legislation.     Lord Halifax said that he had received the Polish Ambassador that morning and had told him of the approach that was being made in Paris, Warsaw  and Moscow.   To illustrate the point of view of His Majesty&apos;s Government, he had
told  the ambassador that if M. Beck were to say to him:  &quot; You invite us toside  with you in the event of German aggression.  What have you to say aboutDanzig? &quot;  he would reply that if Poland and Germany were to come to a directagreement about Danzig, so much the better; but if there  should  develop outof the Danzig question any threat to the independence of Poland,  then, in hisopinion, and, he thought, in that of His Majesty&apos;s Government, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment would  have to treat it as a grave question which was of  concern to all.  -    - -         ,  -       . &quot;  -             .          ;-;.     The  way His Majesty&apos;s Government saw the situation was  not different from the point of  view expressed by M. Bonnet.  His  Majesty&apos;s  government thought that it  was now a question  of  checking  German aggression, whetheragainst France or Great Britain, or Holland, or Switzerland, or Rouu^&amp;aitt, orPoland, or Yugoslavia, or whoever it  might be.  They saw no escape from this.As they had said in their telegram, they thought the best  way to handle thiswould be to propose that the four  Great Powers should join  in a  declaration to be published  in the terms  suggested.   Their feeling  was that if they wereto begin by trying to  discuss any particular  question, this would be likely  totake  too long.  What  was vitally necessary was to  assert the general positionas quickly  as possible.  This would be a danger signal to German and Italianaggression and at the same time a rallying point for the smaller countries.     (At  this point Lord Halifax read  to M. Bonnet the text of the proposed declaration copy annexed.)     Lord Halifax  continued that if  some general declaration could be quicklysecured, the next step  would be to approach the Balkan Entente and ask them whether  they were prepared to act together in case of aggression by Germany,with the knowledge that if they did so, the  Great Powers would act with them.     Lord Halifax added that the  Soviet  Ambassador had  seen him  on  theprevious day and  had proposed a conference at Bucharest.   In M. Maisky&apos;opinion the advantages of this proposal were (1)  that it would be expeditious,(2) that it would be valuable psychologically  both in Berlin and Bucharest. lord halifax had replied that he was doubtful about the proposal  for a conference,for  two reasons,  (1) that it would be difficult for  His Majesty&apos;s Government tosend a ministerial representative to Bucharest, (2) that it would be dangerous tohold a conference before being certain of reaching an agreed conclusion.  HisMajesty&apos;s  Government thought  it  essential to  move  quickly  and thereforepreferred their own plan.     Lord Halifax added that he had seen the Polish Ambassador that morning.Count Raczynski had  made the same point as the Polish Ambassador in Parisabout the desirability  of avoiding a clash between Roumania and Hungary.  Hehad told Count Raczynski that His Majesty&apos;s Government had done and would do what they could in  this sense.  The ambassador had! added, as from himself,that he warmly welcomed His Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s proposal, though he wasnot  in a position to say what the view of the Polish Government would be.     Lord Halifax  said that he had also seen the Turkish Ambassador that day and had given him a general idea of the British proposal.  The Turkish Ambas-ambassador had said that Turkey would in all cases observe her Balkan engagements.Lord Halifax had told him that if the proposed declaration were signed, thenext step would be to approach the smaller Powers, and it would be a matter fordiscussion among the  four Powers what the nature of their approach would be.     Lord Halifax  had put to the Turkish Ambassador the  question whether, iLPoland,  for  example,  were attacked,  and if France and Great Britain went toher assistance, Turkey would be ready to join them.   The Turkish Ambassador&apos;s1reply had been that if Great Britain were  prepared to  act with Turkey in theMediterranean, Turkey would be prepared to go as  far as Great Britain in her own geographical area.  The Turkish Ambassador had said that he spoke with full knowledge of the mind of the Turkish Government.     Lord Halifax then asked M. Bonnet whether the French Government saw the situation in much the same way as this.     M. Bonnet replied that in general they did.  One thing, however, was capital.It was absolutely essential to get Poland in.  Russian help would only be effective if Poland were collaborating. If Poland collaborated,  Russia could give verygreat assistance; if not, Russia  could give much less.  The  strongest pressuremust therefore be brought to bear upon Poland
    Lord Halifax said that he was entirely of M.  Bonnet V opinion.  Did notM. Bonnet think  that if- Great Britain and France took the view that in theirown interest it was essential to stop German aggression^ wherever it might start,Poland might also be brought to think that it would not be to her interest to seeGreat Britain and France  greatly weakened?   If they  were : greatly weakened,Poland would then be defenceless against Germany.    M. Bonnet said that he agreed, and  that that was why he thought poland would be mad not to join with Great Britain.and France.    Reverting to  the declaration,  he said that it was important to think of  thepractical aspect.  If it were a question of stopping the Germans in Switzerland,the Kronen  army had a convenient  field of operations.  But in the  case of roumania, it was certain  that if-the  Powers  most closely  interested,  namely,Roumanians neighbours, Poland and Russia, did nothing, it would be  much moredifficult for France to act, for geographical reasons.  That was why the action ofthe border States, and above all  of  Poland,  was of capital importance.  TheGermans might well use the same arguments  as  they had done in the case ofCzeoho-Slovakia.  The French army was far removed from the scene of  operations.The Franco-Polish Pact would not apply,  since it would only come into operationif France herself were attacked.  It would,-in fact, be insupportable if, Germanyhaving attacked Roumania, and France having attacked Germany in her support,the Poles were to say that their pact with  France did not  apply,  it being-remembered that  Poland had a greater interest  in Roumania&apos;s fate than hadFrance, as well as having a treaty with Roumania.  It was desirable, therefore,to go to the utmost limit,  even to the extent of threats, to bring Poland in.    M. Bonnet then turned  to the question of Russia, and stated that the Russiansneeded watching.   They  liked to make  public  declarations  for propaganda purposes which did not correspond with their real intentions.   It was therefore necessary for each party to say exactly what it was  prepared to do.    He recalled that during the  Czecho-Slovak crisis in May last he had told M. Litvinov that  France would fulfil her obligations, and had asked what  theSoviet  Union would do.   M. Litvinov replied that,  in order to reach Germany,Russia had to have a  passage through Poland and Roumania,  it was thereforefOr France to arrange matters with those two States. If France could do so, theSoviet  Union would fulfil her  obligations to Czecho-Slovakia.  M. Bonnet saidthat he had tried  to arrange matters with Poland  and Roumania, but  had failed.When he had seen M. Litvinov at Geneva in September, M. Litvinov&apos;s  attitude had been that in that event it would be necessary  to consult the League Council,and that, if a majority of  the  Council were secured, the Soviet Union would beable to help, by sending  aircraft across Roumania (but not across Poland).  Tothis M. Bonnet had replied that by that time  Germany would already have succeeded in her aims, and  it would be too late.    For  this kind of  reason M. Bonnet thought that it was necessary  for each party to say exactly what it would do what material it would send;  how manyguns;  how many  aircraft;  what number of troops.  All these questions  must be cleared up.    M. Bonnet agreed that the time had come to call a halt to Germany, but theproposed obligation was so vast that it was necessary to know how each countrystood.  The French army was in a good state, but the French Government did not want to have to bear the burden of the war alone.  British help on  land would at first be very small.  If, in an eastern war, there was  no help from Poland orfrom any other eastern  country,  France would be  in  a bad position.   It wastherefore  necessary that  the countries  most interested  should pronounce them-selves, and the Poles were certainly interested, since they were directly  menaced.    Lord Halifax said that all this was true.  There were,&apos; he thought, two things to be borne in mind :--    (1) If the situation we feared arose, the primary question would not be :  can we give  direct assistance  to  Poland or  Roumania? but:  can we  conduct  a successful war against Germany?   Whatever the cause of the war might be, thatwas the principal  question.   Could Great Britain and France so damage germany that they Could achieve their purpose of checking her?    Lord Halifax said.that he would have thought, though the question requiredcareful consideration, that  if France and Great Britain were prepared to take avery firm line, even without the certainty of Polish support at the outset, this veryfact would be likely to bring Poland in.
Jo : He.entirely agreed with M. Bonnet in recognising the c.apitah,iHirjoTtance ofRoland, and even the need for using very plain language to the Polish Government. 1 -  (2), -The second point was that it should be remembered that there was smallAaiiice:of ;peace:ia.i-EuropeL&apos;i80?long&apos; ag     Niazjis- remained in power: ; There was,however,; some; evidence to show that, if Herr Hitler brought the German peopleinto a major war, this might w,ell be followed by internal consequences; in Germanydisastrous to the Nazi regime.  The same might also be true of Italy.    Lord Halifax said that his conclusion was (though he did  not know whetherthis represented the final attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government) that, even if no assurance of Poland&apos;s collaboration  could  be obtained in advance-and  thiswould, of course, affect Russia&apos;s capacity to help it would still be  very difficult for France and Great  Britain to take no action if there was a further act of aggression by  Germany.    It was worth looking at the possible causes of aggression.  If  Poland were attacked, Poland would obviously resist.  If the attack came in the west,  GreatBritain and France would be bound to resist, and if the attack was upon France,the Polish Treaty obligations came into play.  If the attack  went towards the balkans and the Balkans were  solid, then,  if  Great Britain  and France actedfirmly, this  would  probably be the best chance of bringing  Poland,  also intocollaboration.    (At 6-45 the conversation was interrupted, and it was agreed to continue iton the following day wuth the Prime Minister.)                                  Annex.                             Draft Declaration.    WE,  the  undersigned, duly  authorised to that effect, hereby declare that,inasmuch  as peace and security in Europe are matters of common interest andconcern, and since European peace and security may be affected by any  actionwhich constitutes a threat to the political independence of any European State,our respective Governments hereby undertake immediately to consult  together as to what steps should be taken to offer joint resistance to any such action.                                     II.Record of an Anglo-French Conversation, held in the Prime Ministers Room at             the House of Commons, on March 22, 1939, at 5 P.M.                                  Present:         Mr. Chamberlain (Prime Minister).         Lord Halifax (Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs).         Sir A. Cadogan (Permanent Under-Secretary of State).         Sir E. Phipps (Ambassador in Paris).         Mr. Strang (Foreign Office).         M. Georges Bonnet (Minister  for Foreign Affairs).         M. Corbin (Ambassador in London).         M- Bressy (Private Secretary to M. Bonnet).                     EUROPEAN SITUATION (continued).     Lord Halifax said that there were two points which the meeting might con-sider :  (1) If the Polish reply to our recent approach was evasive or negative, itwould  be necessary to examine what the  next step would be; (2)  There had beendisturbing information about Hungarian troop movements and about the presencepf  20-25  German divisions on  the  German-Hungarian frontier.    He  was proposing to send telegrams to  His Majesty&apos;s representatives at Budapest andBucharest, instructing them to support the action the Polish Government were taking with a view to avoiding a clash.  He wondered whether it would be possibleto take some step in Rome.
    M. Bonnet said that, after talking to M. Daladier, he was in a position to saythat the-French Government were prepared to sign the proposed declaration.    He emphasised the importance of Polish participation, as he had done on theprevious day.  Pie had enquired of the Polish Ambassador in Paris what poland would do if Roumania were attacked and if France and Great Britain helpedRoumania.    The Polish reply  had been that no. answer could be  given unlessRoumania herself put the question.    Lord Halifax said that his  latest information about the Polish  attitude was as follows : His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Warsaw  had sent a  telegram on theprevious day, reporting that M. Beck thought that our proposal demanded serious consideration.  His chief preoccupation was  Soviet participation.    Hitherto,Poland had kept the balance between Germany and the Soviet Union; the proposed declaration would put Poland in the Soviet camp, and the reaction in germany would be serious.  Poland, M.  Beck said, must weigh the pros and  cons, and meanwhile he could not give any  definite answer.  He implied that the partici-pation of the Soviet Government would lead to difficulties, but that Poland mightbe able to associate herself with England and France if Soviet Russia were not included.    Mr. Chamberlain said he expected that Poland would find it more difficult to sign the proposed declaration than to say what she would do if Roumania were attacked.  Her view might be that, if she were sure of the support of France andGreat Britain,  she would be ready  to associate herself with them in defendingRoumania, since if Roumania went.  Poland would  soon follow.    M. Bonnet said that he gathered that in the view of the Polish  government there was no imminent danger of  an attack by  Germany  upon Roumania,  byHungary upon Roumania or by Germany upon Hungary.  In the Polish view thebest course in present circumstances would be to try and improve relations betweenRoumania and Hungary.   The Polish  Government insisted on the  fact thatRoumania,  although the ally of Poland,  had not  asked for any supplementaryguarantees from Poland.  That being so, it was difficult to discuss the question with other Powers like Great Britain, France and Russia.    M.  Bonnet suggested  that  Great  Britain  and  France  might  put thefollowing  question  to  Poland :   Supposing  Germany  attacked  Roumania, andGreat Britain and France rendered assistance,  what would Poland do %  If thequestion were put in this form, it would be difficult for Poland to give a negativeanswer.    Lord  Halifax asked whether M. Bonnet thought that, in answering thisquestion, Poland&apos;s judgment would be affected by the  question whether or not someenquiry was being addressed to the Soviet Union.    M. Bonnet thought that the conversations should be conducted with Polandfirst; but Poland might well be asked whether, if we could bring in the help ofRussia also, Poland would not think this helpful.  If things could be kept quiet,and anything in the nature of a public agreement with the Soviet Union avoided,perhaps Poland would accept indirect assistance  from the  Soviet Union in the shape of war material.  If Poland did not participate, Russian  assistance wouldbe worth very little; but if Poland  did participate,  Russian assistance would be important.    Mr. Chamberlain asked why this was so.  It was true that the  Soviet union had no common frontier with  Germany, but she had  a common frontier with roumania and was therefore in a position to help her.     M. Bonnet here recalled what he had told Lord  Halifax on  the previous dayabout his recent conversation with  the Roumanian  Ambassador at Paris.  Thelatter had said that Polish help was essential,  but  that Soviet  assistance would cause difficulties.  The Roumanians  remembered more than one Russian invasion,and some of the upper class preferred Hitler to Stalin.     It would, M. Bonnet thought,  be an advantage  if Soviet help could be acceptedby both Poland and Roumania.  The important&apos; thing, however, was not  to givePoland (or, indeed, Roumania) a pretext for running out on account of Russia.     The argument to use would be to point to German action in Czecho-Slovakiaand Memel, and to say that if Poland allowed Germany to go into Roumania shewas lost.   It  was therefore  of importance  to  prevent such a  development.
Great Britain and France would be prepared to help, and it would.therefore be reasonable for Poland to accept their collaboration and to work out details. - Whenthe basis of such collaboration had been laid, Poland would have less excuse for:refusing indirect Soviet assistance in  the  form of war material  Or  aircraft.Poland  still  attached importance  to her  treaty with  France, and she desiredassistance from Great Britain.  Both these facts could be used as a lever to secure *her participation in the organisation which We were trying  to build up for thedefence  of  Roumania.    Mr. Chamberlain supposed that what Poland would wish to avoid  would beany public  declaration to the effect that the Soviet Union was collaborating.    Lord Halifax observed  that it would be unfortunate if we were now so toact as to give the  Soviet Government  the  idea that  we were pushing her toone side.    .M.   Bonnet thought  it might  be possible to explain  the  situation  toM.  Litvinov.    The object in view was to prevent  the expansion of Germanism.  In  orderto do this,  Germany must be made to feel that she would meet with resistance in the east.  If Poland and Roumania  gave the impression that they  were notfavourable  to any scheme for the  organisation of defence against Germany, itwould be impossible to produce such an impression on Germany.  Hitler wouldcertainly conclude that he risked nothing if Poland and Roumania did not resist.    M.  Bonnet himself could not believe that Poland would refuse to collaborate.The question was one of life and death to her.    M.  Corbin suggested that it would still be possible to say that we were inconsultation with the Soviet Government.    Lord Halifax thought the conclusion to which the conversation was tendingwas the following :  The first step would  be to  think of the particular case of roumania,  and to assure ourselves (1) that Roumania would  resist, and (2) that,if Roumania resisted, Poland would support her.  In order  to persuade poland to commit  herself to support Roumania, Great Britain and  France would haveto give  Poland a private undertaking that, if Poland came in, they would bothcome  in also.  Having  reached this understanding with Poland, it  might be suggested to both Poland and Roumania that they should not raise any  objectionto our doing our best, both in their interest and in our own, to secure Sovietparticipation.    M.  Bonnet agreed with this conclusion, and thought that something mightbe done on  these lines.  He had gained the impression that the  Poles did not likevague obligations, but, if something precise could be put before them, they wouldprobably accept.    Mr. Chamberlain assumed that an  attack by Hungary would be treated inthe same way as an attack by Germany.  Germany might well  apply  the moderntechnique,  and deliver her attack in the guise of an  attack by Hungary.    M.  Bonnet repeated that the French Government were ready to sign theproposed declaration, if His Majesty&apos;s  Government wished to go on with  it.    Mr. Chamberlain said the value of  the declaration lay in it being signed by four Powers.  If two of the four  refused to sign, it would not  carry  the sameweight.   The participation of the Soviet Union in a public declaration  made the participation of Poland and others very difficult.    Lord Halifax said that if this was  the conclusion,  the next step would be todo whatever was necessary to ascertain  the views of the Polish and RoumanianGovernments on the limited question of assistance to Roumania.    M.  Bonnet agreed.    M.  Corbin suggested that the question of Hungary should  not be overlooked.Hungary was no doubt now a satellite of Germany, but Poland still  regardedHungary as  her  friend, while Roumania considered her as a possible enemy.Gould not Hungary be somehow brought into the proposed combination ?  Whenthe Polish  and Roumanian  Governments  were being consulted would  it not bepossible to  inform the Hungarian  Government  also,  since by so doing  we might make it easier for her to safeguard her independence against German pressure?
    M. Bonnet suggested that the Soviet Union might be asked at the same timein what way they could help  Poland and Roumania,  on the assumption thatGreat Britain and France also gave assistance!,    Mr. Chamberlain pointed out that neither Great Britain nor France could give direct help to Roumania.  Their assistance would have to take the form of pressure on Germany&apos;s western front. , .  Lord  Halifax said that another  point that might arise was  that  poland would no doubt expect Great Britain,  France and Roumania to do for her what it was now proposed  that Great  Britain, France  and Poland should  do forRoumania.    Mr.  Chamberlain remarked that it  was important  to  remember  in  this connexion that Poland had a common frontier with Germany, while roumania had not.    Lord Halifax said that he understood, therefore, that we were to proceed onthe assumption that if Roumania  were  attacked  and offered resistance, and  ifPoland went to her  assistance,  Great Britain and France would both also  join in giving assistance;  and that the proposed approach to Poland and Roumaniawould be made by Great Britain and France simultaneously.  It would, however,first be necessary  to wait for the formal reply of the Polish Government  (though not of the  Soviet Government) to the  approach that His Majesty&apos;s Governmenthad made in regard to the declaration.    Mr. Chamberlain said that if the Polish reply, as was to be expected, wasnegative or evasive, the intention would not be to press them any further, but to try the new procedure now proposed.                          Relations with Germany.    M.  Bonnet said that the  State Secretary had  received the French protestabout Czecho-Slovakia pretty badly,  and had said that France would regret  it.The French Ambassador had  the impression that  responsible circles in Berlinwere critical of Hitler&apos;s latest move.  The Italian Ambassador in Berlin had alsobeen far from enthusiastic, and had, indeed, not allowed his military attache togo to meet Hitler on his return from Prague. Unofficial emissaries from Romehad let it be known in Paris that the Italian Government had not been informed of Herr Hitler&apos;s intentions, had much regretted what had passed and had begun to feel themselves threatened.    Mr. Chamberlain remarked that the assurances given by  Herr Hitler  to Signor Mussolini might well be broken in the same way as those given to  himself.    Lord  Halifax  said that His Majesty&apos;s  Government  had not  come to any decision about the date of Sir N.  Henderson&apos;s return  to Berlin, though he did not think they would be in any hurry about it.    M. Bonnet said that the view of the French Ambassador in Berlin, who had also been withdrawn, was that it was dangerous for France not to be represented by her Ambassador in Berlin.   The French  Government  proposed to send him back at a  suitable  moment, since they thought it would be useful to have him there.   When withdrawing him, they had  never had it  in  mind to break  off relations with Germany.     Lord  Halifax  said he recognised the force  of this,  and  thought  the two Governments should keep in touch on this  matter, and if possible act together.       ,,                          Spain.       .i  -     M. Bonnet said that, as the British Ministers knew, the French had  interned the Spanish Republican fleet at Bizerta and disarmed it.  General Franco had now, basing himself on the agreement  concluded by M. Berard, asked for the return of  these ships.     As .the British Ministers  also knew, there were 450,000 Spanish refugees in the south of France, of whom 250,000 were soldiers.  It required two army corps to guard these refugees, and M. Bonnet added in confidence that this situation
would make it impossible for France to mobilise in that area in case of trouble.The  Spanish Government were only taking back  300  of  these refugees a day.Marshal Petairi had been pressing for an acceleration of the rate of repatriation,It was important to secure this on&apos;grounds of national defence.             * &apos;.-;    General Franco, however, was bargaining, and refused, to increase  the-, rateof. repatriation unless the-French returned the ships at&apos;Bizerta.          r.    v    M.  Bonnet was, on the whole, in favour &quot;of  returning the ships, though Ke;was aware that, if  a conflict broke out and General Franco  intervened against france,  he would be attacked for having returned them.        ;  -     ^    He  wished, however, to know what view His  MajestyV Government wouldtake.  There was also the question whether France,  by returning the ships, wouldbe violating the Non-intervention Agreement.                              .    Mr. Chamberlain said that at first sight both he and  Lord Halifax thoughtthat His Majesty&apos;s Government would have no objection to the  return of the ships,;but it would be necessary first to consult the Admiralty and Lord Plymouth.  Hewould try to give M. Bonnet a reply on the following day.                j ;                            French Air Force.;&apos;   Mr, Chamberlain said he hoped M. Bonnet would excuse him if he raised a rather delicate point.   During  the conversations in Paris  in November  1938M; Daladier had told him that at the end of the spring French aircraft production-tion would be 400 a month.  He had expressed his astonishment, since this wouldmean a fivefold increase.  The end of the spring had not yet come, but his present information seemed to confirm the doubts he had expressed.    Since that time a mission of production experts from France had visited thiscountry.  He was bound to say they had not created a very good impression upon our experts here.   Our own people  were well acquainted with the difficulties ofincreasing production, and, indeed, had been successful in overcoming them.. they thought,  therefore, that their French colleagues  would put questions on thissubject, and that they would be able to exchange notes on their common difficulties.They found, however, that the French Mission did not appear to realise what thedifficulties were.   This situation had  caused  His  Majesty&apos;s Government  some anxiety.  Could M. Bonnet give some idea of present and future aircraft producttion in France ?    M. Bonnet admitted that he had had his doubts about the figures given byM. Daladier.   Difficulties had been created by the social laws passed by M. Blum&apos;first Government, particularly, the collective  contracts.  M.  Daladier proposed toissue  decrees under his new full powers, amending this earlier legislation, andthe hours of work in the armament industries  would be still further increased.This should improve the situation.    As regards present figures,  he  could say in confidence that during the lastmonth 100 aircraft had been produced.   By July or August the figure would beabout 250 or  300.  Purchases were  also being made in the  United States.    Mr. Chamberlain said that his information from the United  States led himto believe that the Americans had not given the same attention to military aircraftas to  civil aircraft, and that in design their military aircraft were inferior tothe British.    M.. Bonnet said that President Roosevelt had  agreed  to give the French a machine which was not yet  in the service in the American air force. This wasa very good machine, but  it would  not come into full  production until thefollowing September.    Mr.  Chamberlain  said  that, without wishing  to intrude, he would assureM, Bonnet that;-if there was anything we could do to help the French to buildup their output, we should be glad to collaborate.  Our own difficulties had been successfully overcome, and our production was.now nearly 600 aircraft a month.    M. Bonnet asked whether  it would be possible to buy aircraft  in GreatBritain. \     [18845]- ...   .c
                                   -III.Despatch to His Majesty&apos;s Charge d\Affaires in Paris recording a Conversation    between the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the French Foreign    Minister at Windsor on March 23, 1939.Sir,                                         Foreign Office, March 23, 1939.    I HAD the opportunity of some further conversation with M. Bonnet to-day after luncheon  at Windsor. M. Bonnet began by showing me various telegramsthat he had received from the French Charged&apos;Affaires at Berlin and from the ambassador at Rome.  The messages from Berlin were based, to the  best of myrecollection, upon conversations that the French Charge d&apos;Affaires had had withthe Belgian and other representatives, informing him of their own conversations with the representatives of the German Foreign Office.  The  general effect ofthese exchanges was in the sense of assurances that German policy was not  setupon any of the sinister schemes attributed to it outside Germany.    2.   The  principal  point of  the  telegram   received  from  the  french ambassador in Rome was  to emphasise the extreme importance of avoiding theimpression that the democratic countries were  lining  up against the dictatorcountries  on  grounds  of difference  in  political philosophy.  The  french ambassador reported that Italian opinion had  been a good deal impressed bythe vigour of the British reaction to events in Czecho-Slovakia,  but had been notless impressed by the danger to which this reaction, if uncontrolled, might quicklylead. :    3.   I told  M.  Bonnet that I was in complete agreement with him upon thepoint indicated in  both sets of communications, namely, that we should do every-thing that we could to avoid exposing ourselves to a  charge either of encirclementor of framing a  line-up on  ideological prejudice.  The  Prime  Minister  wasanswering a question in the House of  Commons this afternoon which would bedirected to this particular point.-  It  must, however, obviously be the purposeof those controlling the Government of dictator  countries to represent reactions&apos;abroad in a light as unfavourable to their own peoples as  possible.    4.   From  this M.  Bonnet proceeded to speak about practical questions arising in regard  to Franco-Italian differences.   There  had been,  as I knew,approaches from the Italian side by persons claiming to be in Signor Mussolini&apos;confidence. . The French Ministers had not  received these intermediaries direct,nor did M. Bonnet tell me, except in general terms, what  kind of proposals theyhad made.  It  had been impossible for the French  Government  to risk exposingthemselves to  rebuff  by responding to this very  unofficial and  non-committalmethod of approach.  If  Signor Mussolini was serious  in his desire to reachaccommodation with France, it was easy for him to find better  and firmer meansof ascertaining the French attitude.  M. Bonnet did not anticipate, if I rememberrightly, that the  Italian  claims would involve  any  territorial demands, and,provided that reasonable Italian claims could be reasonably advanced, he did notthink French public opinion would be unduly difficult or intractable.    5.  I said that from time to time we had considered whether  there wasanything  possible that we could do officially in  this matter,  but  that I had come to the conclusion that,  if Signor Mussolini wished to assist a settlement,it would  be because of the general pressure of events and  that, unless therewas this general pressure of events, I did not feel very confident that anythingwe could  say or do would make any great difference. The opportunity might    Mr. Chamberlain said he doubted whether there was any surplus available:    &apos;M. Bonnet asked whether he could take it that our figure was 600 a month.    Mr, Chamberlain said he could not remember the exact figure, but it was nearly 600-perhaps about 580.  In September last the figure had been only 250;                        (The meeting closed at 6-45.)
 come later, but there, was a certain danger at this moment, if we fried to come in to discussions of questions ^between France and Italy, that had not yet been; formulated; of placing both the French Government and ourselves in a delicate and false  position.  With  this M.  Bonnet agreed.    &apos; 6.   Passing from this, M. Bonnet said that there was  one subject on which he:wished, if he might, to speak to me with complete frankness and the greatest earnestness.  ; Yesterday the Prime  Minister  had drawn M. Bonnet&apos;s attention to the  unsatisfactory  state of; development  in  French productive capacity in the matter of  their air  force.   The French  Government  were well aware of how much their national effort on this side still left to be desired,  and it was M. Bonnefs intention  to convey to  M. Daladier the offer  made by  the Prime Minister yesterday to  help  the French Government with technical advice  based on our  own experience as to how production  difficulties could best be overcome. He thought this a very valuable proposal.     7.   But, if the French Government must admit,  as  they did,  very grave weakness in this regard,  he also wished to draw my attention to the situation as they visualised  it on  land in any future war.   Here  was France, with  a population  of  some  40  millions,  called upon  to  face a  potential threat of 80 millions in Germany  and 40 millions in Italy.  M. Bonnet developed the argument,  which is familiar enough,  with great vigour  and conviction,  from the  angles both of the influence of this situation  on  French opinion  and on opinion in Germany and Italy./ If the people  of France  thought that it was impossible to look to Great Britain for any really substantial measure of military help  for,  say,  eighteen  months,  the  consequences might  be  profound  and irretrievable.  If, on the other  hand, it could be presented to them that,  after the outbreak of war, Great Britain would be in a  position to give  substantial military support at the end of, say, six or eight months,  that would be a very much less  unfavourable position.     8.   This led M. Bonnet to urge, with  all  the persuasion  that he could command,  that  this country  should  adopt in some  form,  whether  direct con- scription or otherwise,  national service.  He knew our difficulties traditional, industrial, practical and the effect that these must all exercise  in the political sphere.   Nevertheless, he  permitted  himself to remind me of what had been the march of events in France -M. Daladier&apos;s  Government maintained in power by an immense preponderance of votes which securely represented public opinion, and a Government  that had originally relied for its support upon parties and policies  of  the  Left, now  entrusted  by general assent with complete powers enabling it to&quot; take whatever steps  national  safety  seemed to dictate.  It  was surely an arresting example of how  deeply democracy will  respond to leadership if it believes itself in the  face of  danger.  M.  Bonnet earnestly  hoped,  as he was sure did the French Government, that the Prime Minister and His Majesty&apos;s Government in  Great  Britain might feel  able  to take  an  analogous course in regard to the steps necessary  to reinforce our military strength.     9.   I told M. Bonnet that I was, of course, deeply concerned by, as I was well aware of, all the considerations he had urged.  I certainly had no doubt at all as to the effect that would be exerted, whether in France  or in Germany,  were His Majesty&apos;s Government  in this  country ever able to  take the kind of action that he had outlined.   I  could also  readily appreciate what  was likely to be, perhaps to an increasing extent, the movement of French thought on this matter. On the  other hand, he would know how real were the difficulties arising and how grave might be the repercussions on the whole strength  and capacity  of this country  if they were rudely handled.  I should, however,  of  course, place the Prime Minister and all my colleagues in very frank possession of what he had said.     10.  The last matter to which M. Bonnet referred was the question of the return of our Ambassadors to Berlin, on which  we  had also spoken last night.The French Charge d&apos;Affaires  in Berlin had expressed a  clear view that he thought the sooner the Ambassador could be  got back   the better, by reason ofthe general advantage  of  personal contact and ambassadorial influence.   I told M. Bonnet that I could appreciate these considerations, although I  thought it was difficult to return our Ambassadors quite immediately, in view of the general
approbation that had been accorded to our bringing them away, as a mark of our;censure of German action.  M. Bonnet was, however, anxious that we should notdrift into the position of having decided upon a punitive withdrawal.   I saidthat when the appropriate time arrived no doubt some pretext for return couldbe found  between us.   I thought it, however,  important  that  we  should acttogether and, from our  point of view, it had occurred to me that,  if and when we wanted to send our Ambassador back, it might be easier for us to do this onthe ground of the desirability of having him there to assist in the treatment of,&apos;and to bring pressure on behalf of, refugee questions.                                                         I am, &amp;c.                                                             HALIFAX.
