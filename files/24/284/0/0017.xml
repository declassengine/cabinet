(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY *S GOVERNMENT.)SECRET.Memorandum by the Minister for Co-ordination,..of..Defenoe*            At their 551st Meeting on 16th March, 1939,     the Committee of Imperial Defence had under consideration     the Report  of a Sub-Committee appointed to investigate     the possibility and implications of developing a system     of wire broadcasting to such an extent in peace-time as     would justify complete reliance upon it in war for     passive defence purposes.     2.     The Sub-Committee came to the conclusion that     they could not recommend any arrangements which would     result in the development in the near future of a wire     broadcasting system on such a scale as to dispense     entirely with the necessity for a wireless system in     time of war.   The arrangements already approved^ by     the Cabinet for the short-term policy of broadcasting     in war-time must, therefore, continue to hold good and     must also be regarded as the intermediate-term policy.     But since, for the reasons set out in the report,     broadcasting by wire has immense advantages over the     wireless system in war-time and would be of great valueCP. 70 (39).COPY NOCABINET.WIPE BROADCASTING.51 Annex A,&amp; Cabinet 35 (38) Conclusion .11.

The proposals of the Sub-Committee are set outin para. 32 of the  Report.   The Committee of ImperialDefence endorsed them,  and I now recommend them to my colleagues for approvals4.     Recommendation (viii) proposes that an announcementof the scheme for the development of wire broadcastingshould be made in Parliament as  soon as possible, andshould include a reference to  the deterioration  inwar-time of the existing  standard of peace-time  wirelessbroadcasts.   I suggest that the terms  of this announcement  should be drafted by the Postmaster-general in consultation with myself.5.     It will be noticed from para. 31 of the Reportthat the Governing  Body of the British broadcasting corporation have not so far been approached.   ThroughSir Noel Ashbridge, Chief Engineer of the B.B.C., whowas a member  of the Sub-Committee, both the Chairmanof the Governing Body and the  Director-General of theCorporation have been kept in  touch informally withthe deliberations of the  Sub-Committee  and they  have

is                     Sub-Committee on Wire Broadcasting.                                  REPORT.                                INTRODUCTION.     IN the summer  of  1938  the  Standing Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial  Defence on the Control of  Radio  Transmission  had  under con- sideration the arrangements  to be  made for broadcasting in the event &quot;of war. In the  course  of their enquiries they were impressed  with  the  difficulties which would be experienced  in operating during war a wireless system  which would be adequate for the needs of civil defence but which would not provide assistance to an enemy,  and they  reached the conclusion that only a wire broad- casting  system  could completely  fulfil  these conflicting  requirements.   They therefore recommended* that  the possibility and implications of the introduction of such a system in peace on a scale sufficient to rely on it exclusively in time of war should be considered  by  an authoritative body.  This recommendation was endorsed in their report of the 22nd  July,  1938, by the Cabinet Committee on Overseas Broadcasting, to whom the Post Office had submitted a  Memorandum t on the matter.   The  Cabinet  also approved the recommendation  at its Meeting on the 27th July, and&apos; we were accordingly appointed on the 6th January last with terms of reference  as set out on  the opposite page. Present Position of Wire Broadcasting.     2.   Wire broadcasting is at present  available to a very small section  of the public in certain parts of this  country through the medium of 326 Relay Exchange Companies, which have  only  about  250,000 subscribers,  representing rather less than 3  per. cent, of  the  total number  of  wireless licensees.   Each of  these Companies receives wireless broadcasts in the ordinary way at a central station,. provided and operated by the Company.  At this station the wireless signals are converted to &apos;&apos; audio &apos;&apos; frequencies and are transmitted by wires to the subscriber&apos;s- premises, at which the  only  apparatus required is a loudspeaker.   The wires between the central station and the subscriber&apos;s premises are normally erected and maintained by the Companies, although in some cases a  few lines connecting the central stations to distribution points are  rented from the Post Office.  The great majority of the Companies charge Is. Qd.  a week and  offer a  choice of two programmes.  A very  few offer three or four programmes; and 68 small exchanges, serving about 12 per cent,  of the total  number of relay subscribers, give only ono programme and charge fees of the order of Is. Od. a week. Possibilities of Expansion in  the Near Future.     3.   If wireless broadcasting  has  to close down in war  time  and we are to rely entirely upon a system of wire broadcasting as a substitute, it would, in our opinion,  be necessary  to ensure that at  least 70 to 80 per  cent, of listeners (or say seven millions out of the present total of about nine millions) should be equipped for wire  reception.   Whatever may be the  possibilities of  an expansion  on  a self-supporting  basis  in  the activities of  the Relay Companies, with which we deal in the later parts of this Report, it  is clear that such a development couldnot be expected  within the next few years.  In order to secure such a large-scaletransfer  from wireless reception to  wire  reception within a period of, say, twoor three years, we are satisfied that it  would be necessary for the  State itself toprovide a wire service on a nation-wide scale and to offer it to the public at  a nominal fee or even free of charge.    4.  To this, however, there are two insuperable  objections :     (a)  First, for a free service the capital cost involved would be of the  order           of  100 million, on which the  interest and sinking  fund alone would           be between  4 and  5 million a year.   In addition, the  Exchequer          would have to  bear the  annual cost of  maintenance and operation          which would  amount to  several millions more.  Further details are-           set out in the  Appendix to this report.              * C.I.D. Paper No. 290-A.              f Paper No. A.B.C. (37) 20, not  reproduced.

     (b) Secondly, the Post Office is at present and will for some time to come be           abnormally pressed since, apart from the development of the ordinary           telephone service, it has been charged with a vast amount of special           emergency work for the Fighting Services and Civil Defence, which           would be seriously prejudiced if the energies of its  engineering staff           were diverted to the rapid development of a wire broadcasting service           on a national scale.     5.  We do not, therefore, regard such a scheme for a nation-wide service ofwire broadcasting as a practical proposition, and we are satisfied that the country must for  the  time being continue to rely  in the event of war  on such wirelessbroadcasting as may be possible within the  limits set by considerations of defence.The current  arrangements for wireless broadcasting  in an  emergency have, infact, already  been approved by the  Committee of Imperial Defence  and theCabinet as the  short-term policy for war-time broadcasting.  For the  reasons give  above these arrangements, subject to such modifications as may  become necessary  in the  light of further investigation and technical development must,.we think, continue to be regarded as an &quot; intermediate-term &quot;  policy.     6.  We have  now to consider whether wire broadcasting can play a usefulpart  in any  long-term scheme  for  broadcasting  in time of  war.  Before  a conclusion can be reached on this  question,  it is necessary to assess  the advantageswiiich such a system would  have in time  of war and to consider the extent towhich it is likely to be developed in peace by commercial methods without subsidy.War-Time Comparison of  Wire and Wireless Broadcasting.     7.  Whilst wire broadcasting has certain advantages in peace time to offset the limited choice of programme, m war it has the inestimable merit, as comparedwith a wireless system, that it gives no navigational  aid to enemy aircraft andthat transmissions by it cannot  be  intercepted,  so that Government announce-ments and instructions can be given with  a greater  freedom than would bepossible if they were capable of being picked up by an enemy.  It can thereforebe operated on virtually the same scale as in peace time. Moreover, it would notbe necessary,  as  in the case of synchronised wireless broadcasts, for  the sametransmissions to be sent all over the country.  A wire system could be used for making, over limited areas, announcements of local  significance  which might notbe suitable or  necessary for national broadcasting.  These substantial advantagesare enhanced  by the fact that it seems unlikely that the  present arrangementsfor broadcasting by wireless in time of war (which cannot, in any case, be expectedto give a service approaching the peace-time standard) are capable of appreciableimprovement,  and may, indeed, as a result of technical development in the methodsof direction-finding, be subjected to claims by the Defence Services for  furtherrestriction.Possible Long-Term Expansion of  Wire Broadcasting.     8.  We feel, therefore, that, as an important measure of national defence, thefurther expansion of  the  wire  system  should  be  encouraged  and that  all reasonable steps should be  taken to  introduce it  in  peace  time as widely aspossible,  short of providing an  Exchequer  subsidy and  subject to  adequateprogramme safeguards.  We believe that, given time, a very large developmentof wire broadcasting could be effected by the natural expansion of the activitiesof the Eelay Companies, on  an ordinary commercial basis without subsidy fromthe Exchequer.  The number of recipients  of broadcasts by wire could be furtherextended  by  Post Office transmission over the telephone system.  In  war theexistence  of a wire broadcasting service even oh a  partial scale might prove ofconsiderable value, whilst the possibility of adopting it to the exclusion of wirelesscould be further considered in the future in the light of the development that may-result if the proposals in  this report are  accepted.  Broadcasting by wire onlyduring war time is, of course, the ideal of our long-term policy, since it is by thismeans alone  that the conflicting  desiderata of maximum  facilities  and the elimination of navigational assistance can be fully reconciled.
 Recommendation of the Ullswater Committee,  1935.     9.  We have not  overlooked  the recommendation  in the report*  of  the Ullswater Committee in 1935 that  the licences of the existing Relay Companies should be withdrawn as soon as they expired (on the 31st December, 1936), and that the ownership and operation of relay exchanges and the technical develop- ment of wire broadcasting in general should be undertaken by the Post Office and the control of relay programmes by the British Broadcasting Corporation. This recommendation was not accepted by His Majesty&apos;s Government, who decided to extend the  existing  licences for  a. further period of 3 years only,  expiring on the 31st  December, 1939, during which the Post Office should carry out experi- ments with  a view to determining whether the relay services might gradually be taken over by the Post Office itself.   That Department  made plans to open an experimental service in Southampton  early in 1938 on the &quot; audio &quot;  system as adopted  by the Relay  Companies.  The wireless  trade, however, organised a vigorous campaign  against what  it  regarded  as the  first step  towards  the nationalisation of the Companies&apos;  services.  As a result of this campaign,  the Town Council, which had previously supported the project,  decided to oppose it, and in these circumstances the Post Office abandoned the experiment. Future Policy in regard to Relay Companies.    10.  The  question  of policy in regard to the relay  companies must  in any case be settled at a  very early date since notice would have to be given to  the Companies before the 30th June if it should be decided to terminate their licences on the 31st  December next.  The position has changed fundamentally since  the Ullswater Committee reported, and it is now necessary to take into account  not merely general principles of  broadcasting policy but  also  the defence require- ments of the nation.  We submit that the latter should be the governing con- sideration in determining the decision. Methods of Expansion of Wire Broadcasting.    11.  We consider, therefore, that  every method of encouraging the develop-ment of wire broadcasting without subsidy from the Exchequer should be adopted.Such an expansion can be achieved :     (a) by an extension of the Relay Companies&apos; licences for a substantial period,          subject to appropriate conditions, and    (b) by the concurrent development of a wire broadcasting service over  the          Post Office telephone  network.                        RELAY COMPANIES&apos;  SERVICES.Extension of Licences.     12.  As stated in paragraph 9, the present  licences  of the  326 relay companies are terminable by six months&apos; notice expiring on the 31st december next.  During the last few  years  they  have been marking  time owing to  the uncertainty of their position; but if  they were  given a substantial extension oftheir licences  they would  be encouraged  to embark on fresh capital expenditure and development. There  seems  little doubt that such a development wouldtake  place  on  a  wide scale  as  these  services  are  extremely   popularwith  the  type  of customer  served.   We recommend  therefore  that  the licences be extended for a period of 10 years,  subject to certain  alterations intheir provisions which are indicated in  the  following paragraphs.  The B.B.C.Charter expires seven years after the current relay companies&apos; licences  and  theexperience of  1936 shows  that there is advantage  in considering the position ofthe companies some little time after the review of the B.B.C. Charter.   Apartfrom this consideration, we  think a  10 years&apos;  extension  would be  a materialinducement to the Companies to widen  the field of their services and to instalplant and equipment  of  good  quality,  and that  in this respect it would  be definitely  preferable to one of shorter duration.   New licences, whenever issued,should of  course be terminable on the same date,  namely 31st December, 1949.* Cmd. 5091.
Number of Programmes.     13.  The current licences require  the  companies to give a choice of twoprogrammes.  An exception to this rule was, however, made  in the case of the1)8  small exchanges,  serving about  12  per  cent, of the total number  of relaysubscribers, which gave only one programme and charged a very low fee.  Theyare in poor districts and it was considered undesirable to risk  closing them downby enforcing the new rule.  We recommend  that the new licences should provide that at least two programmes must be given, and that the exception in favour ofthe existing  one-programme exchanges should be continued.Control of Programmes.     14.  The  current  licences  impose  the  following  restrictions   on the programmes  distributed :         .:     (a) Only broadcast  programmes  may  be transmitted  to subscribers; in          particular the  company.may not  itself originate messages, music, &amp;c.     (b) Programmes  or messages containing political, social or religious pro-          paganda received in the English  language from a station  abroad may          not be transmitted.     (e) The Company must obey any directions given by the Postmaster-General          as regard the programmes to be distributed  to subscribers.     (d) The  Company may not receive any  money or other consideration, other          than its subscribers&apos; payments, for the distribution of programmes.     (e) Subscribers must be given the choice  of receiving one of two programmes,          and at all times when programmes are being broadcast by the B.B.C.,          one of such programmes shall be available to subscribers.     (/) The Postmaster-General may require the Company not to transmit to its          subscribers such messages or classes of messages as he may indicate.We understand that arrangements are being made between the Home Office andthe Post Office whereby the restriction (a) above would be modified so  as to admit that in time of  emergency a Company should transmit announcements of localsignificance ordered by the local A.R.P. or Police authorities.     15.  We recommend that the foregoing provisions be continued in  the newlicences,  subject to a  modification of (e). At the time the current licences were issued the Companies giving  only one programme were  informed that  thisprovision might be regarded as inoperative  so long as a single programme onlywas provided.  All the Companies  were also informed,  in accordance with aCabinet  decision, that while the  Postmaster-General was anxious not to fettertheir discretion in regard to the choice of programmes, apart from the require-ments provided by (e) above, he saw very great objection to any growth in therelaying of advertisements included in certain programmes from abroad, and he hoped that the Companies would bear in mind this expression of opinion,  as, ifthe relaying of advertisement programmes grew to serious proportions, he mighthave to take drastic action in regard to it.     16.  An investigation by the Post Office shows that the  Companies make upa very large proportion of their programmes  by using B.B.C. broadcasts.   Whilstwe  have no  reason to think  that they will wish to  change  this practice, weconsider that it would be desirable, in view of the long period proposed for the newlicences,  to include a provision on the following lines requiring a definite per-centage of British programmes to be given :      (a) Existing one-programme  services should be required to provide a B.B.C.          programme for at least 90 per cent, of the total weekly time during          which such a programme is available.     (b) Two-programme   services should be required to provide a  B.B.C.          transmission on one programme at all  times it  is  available,  and          in addition, a second  B.B.C. transmission for at least 75  per  cent, of          the total weekly time when two B.B.C. programmes are available.     (c) Services giving more than two programmes should be required always to          provide two B.B.C. programmes  whenever they are available, or one          B.B.C. programme when only one is available.
The Companies  are  already in practice  fulfilling these conditions  and their inclusion in the Licences will involve no change of practice, although it  will afford a -safeguard against  any undue extension  of  the use of foreign advertisingprogrammes.        -                        -                            -Connection  by  wire ivith B.B.C. stations.     17.  A few companies who have experienced difficulty in obtaining receptionfree from interference have from time  to time asked to be allowed to obtain their programmes by  Avire from the  control rooms at B.B.C. stations.  Suchrequests have hitherto been  refused.  Since the whole object of our proposal is the elimination as  far  as possible  of wireless  transmission  in time  of war,we consider that this prohibition should be withdrawn and that the companies should not only be encouraged to obtain  their programmes in this way, but thatthe  Postmaster-General should  have power under  the licence  to require themto do  so, subject to the payment of  a  suitable rent.   The  Post  Office should-endeavour to provide in peace time (1) for the  actual use of wires in this wayon rental terms in all cases where conditions are  suitable, and (2) for arrange-ments to be made,  in  cases where  the requirement could  not  reasonably  been forced on a  Company in peace  time,  for circuits to be earmarked, ready tohe brought  into use  for wire broadcasting immediately an emergency arose.Purchase by Government.     18.  We consider it essential to retain the  provision in-the current licenceswhereby, if they are terminated,  the Postmaster-General  may,  if he  so desires,take over the plant and apparatus on  &quot;  tramway  terms,&quot; i.e., payment  of  its value at the time, exclusive of any allowance for  loss of profit or goodwill, subjectto arbitration in case  of disagreement.Emergency.     19.  The existing emergency clause in  the licences  should be expanded toprovide that the Postmaster-General  may take possession of the exchanges intime of emergency and close  them or may  require their working to be continuedunder his direction or  subject to  his instructions  in regard  to  the matter to herelayed.                     SERVICE OVER TELEPHONE NETWORK.General nature of Service.     20.  We recommend that, concurrently  with the  development of the relay companies&apos; services,  the Post Office should introduce a service by &quot;carrier&quot;frequency  over the telephone network.   By this means  a choice of four pro-grammes could be  given, two of which  would no  doubt be the National  andHegional B.B.C. programmes, whilst the remaining  two would be selected undera procedure to be agreed between  the Post  Office and B.B.C.  A subscriber tothis service could use his telephone  simultaneously with the reception of a broad-cast programme.  As opposed to reception by &quot; audio&quot; frequency from the relay companies  which requires only  a simple form of loudspeaker, a full  receiving-set would be needed.   Nearly all residential telephone subscribers have wirelesssets which could be used for this  purpose.  By turning a  switch  a subscribercould either (a)  receive one of four programmes by wire or  (b) use his own setfor reception of other programmes  whether British or foreign.  There are abouta million residential telephone subscribers and 700,000 business subscribers. Theservice  would be  introduced first  in districts where conditions seemed most favourable to its success.Advantages in Peace  and War.     21.  The main advantage of the service in peace time would be, as in thecase of the Relay Companies, to give an improved quality of reception, especiallyin districts Where  there is considerable  interference.  In war  time,  it would
provide  all the advantages of the wired system.  Moreover, the service would,for the most part, not be in competition with that-provided by a Relay Company,.since the latter type of service  appeals mainly  to people who find it difficultto buy a wireless set, whereas the telephone service would be available to people who already possess one.^Extension to Non-Telephone Subscribers.                ,,     22.   The service could be extended to non-telephone subscribers, a telephoneline being  linked  to 4 or  5  non-telephone  subscribers in  the vicinity.   Werecommend that, in announcing the scheme, it should be made clear that the servicemight eventually be extended to non-telephone subscribers;  although at the outsetit would be in practice restricted to telephone subscribers, leaving the question of extension  to non-subscribers to  be  decided at  a later  stage  after sufficientexperience had been obtained of the new service.Scale of Charges.     23.  We understand from the Post Office that the service could be offeredwithout  subsidy from the  Exchequer  to telephone subscribers and later,  if so-decided,  to non-telephone subscribers at a charge of about 25s. or  30s. a year,on the understanding that their own wireless sets were used.  When a set requiredrenewal  it would be possible to replace it by a simpler and cheaper type  of setsuitable  for the telephone broadcast  service and capable  of  direct  wirelessreception from a local B.B.C. station, but not from distant stations.  The PostOffice would no doubt arrange with radio manufacturers for suitable sets  to be-sold through ordinary trade channels.                 SERVICE OVER  ELECTRICITY  SUPPLY WIRES.    24.  The suggestion  has sometimes been made that broadcast programmes-should be distributed by  means of the electric light wire network,  and such asystem has been successfully demonstrated on a small scale.   A simple type of receiving set  would be installed  in  the  subscriber^ house  with  the  necessaryconnections, and, under the  latest scheme that has been suggested, it would benecessary to provide a backbone network of special wires in each town.  In some areas the electric light plant would  not be suitable;  and where conditions were favourable it appears to be an open question whether the service could be providedmore cheaply  than by the present system  adopted by the Relay Companies.   Sofar as we are aware, no country  has adopted a system  of broadcasting over the electric light wires;  we understand  that  it was tried in the  United States someyears ago and abandoned.   Nevertheless, if  the  system should be found to be technically and economically sound, we see  no reason why it should not be devolped in this country.    25.  We  understand that electricity  supply  undertakings at present haveho legal powers to use their  wires for the distribution of broadcast programmes-and that efforts that have been made  in  the past to obtain such powers  from parliament have failed, mainly owing to the opposition of the. wireless trade.    26.  We  consider that any possible method of development of wire broad-casting should be encouraged, and we therefore recommend that the Governmentshould be prepared to assist the  electricity supply industry  to  obtain powers to-allow, any licensed relay company to  use their lines on rental  terms for the transmission  of broadcast  programmes.   Provision should  be made that the undertakings, Avhether&apos;municipally. or  privately owned, should have no powerto&quot;conduct -a. wire-broadcasting service themselves, but should only  be  authorisedto allow a licensed Relay Company to make use of their lines for  that purpose the undertakings would thus have no responsibility whatever for the day-to-dayconduct of the service,or power to influence the choice of  programmes.  Responsi-bility for the service would rest solely.with  the Relay  Company, which wouldb&quot; under the control of the Postmaster-General through  the  terms  of its licence-
              ANNOUNCEMENT  OF THE GOVERNMENT^ DECISION.    27.  A very powerful stimulus to rapid development  of  the  relay system would undoubtedly be some authoritative indication that it might not be possibleto maintain wireless broadcasting on peace-time standards  in  time of war.  if our proposals  are  accepted by  the  Government,  we recommend  that theyshould be  announced  in Parliament  at the earliest  possible date, in orderto remove the uncertainty of the  Relay Companies regarding  their future andto enable them to proceed at once with the development  of their existing servicesand the establishment of new ones.  For the reason given above we suggest thatthe announcement of  the scheme should contain  some indication that, whilst it.is the intention of the Government to maintain wireless broadcasting in time ofwar, the service would undoubtedly be liable to some  deterioration or occasionalinterruption as a result of enemy  jamming or other interference.         IMPLICATIONS OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF WIRE BROADCASTING.    28.  We have  been  asked to report on the  implication  of  a substantialdevelopment in the existing wire broadcasting services.  These must be considered in relation to (1) the wireless trade and (2) the general standard  of broadcastprogrammes received in this country.Effect on Wireless Trade.    29.  Under the &quot;audio&quot; system adopted by Relay Companies a subscriberrequires only a  loud speaker instead of a complete  wireless set.   Wireless manu-facturers and retailers would therefore to some  extent be adversely affected.   Onthe other hand, the manufacturers will be engaged on making the loud  speakersrequired for  any expansion  of the wire system, and  additional employment willbe given by  the relay and cable manufacturing Companies.   The present is relatively a convenient time to initiate a change since many wireless manufacturers are busily engaged in making component parts for the armament supply industry.It must, however, be recognised that any substantial expansion of the wire broad-cast system, whenever it occurred, would be bound  to lead to some readjustmentsin the  trade.   But that, we  submit, is not a sufficient ground for withholding a service for which it is clear that there is an appreciable demand in peace andwhich  would be of great value in the event of war.  Broadcasting presumablyexists for the benefit of licence-holders; and wireless manufacturers and dealers.must  accommodate themselves to  supplying the type of  plant  that gives  thesubscriber the services he desires.Effect on Programmes.    30.  As  regards programmes, there is no doubt that the popularity of theservices offered  by the existing relay companies is due in part to  the fact that they provide (particularly on Sundays, but  also in the mornings before the  B.B.C.programmes  begin) alternative programmes of a  more  &apos;&apos; popular &apos;&apos; type fromstations on the Continent,  notably Radio  Normandy and Luxemburg.  these programmes include advertising material.  We have not overlooked the possibility that, if the wire system is developed on a large scale, additional stations issuingprogrammes,  financed by the advertising material  which they contain, might beestablished on the other  side of the Channel, with the result that broadcastingprogrammes  received in this country might gradually  become to some extentcommercialised.  An examination of the programmes of the Relay Companiesover the last two years, however, shows  that over  80 per cent, of the total pro-gramme time of the Companies was devoted to B.B.C. programmes, and that theydo not in fact make anything like full use of their  present powers to broadcastprogrammes  from foreign advertising stations.  While the relay exchanges can give much better reception of foreign stations  than  is possible for a number ofexisting wireless listeners owing to bad reception conditions in  their homes, it is,on the other hand, open to the majority of wireless listeners, if they so desire, totune in all day to  foreign advertising  stations rather than take  a&quot; B.B.C. pro-gramme.  Our  proposals, set out in paragraph 16 above, involve, in terms though.       [18777]                                                       c
not in practice, some tightening up of the existing conditions and we think theyshould be adequate to ensure that the general standard of broadcast programmesreceived  in this  country is not seriously affected.  Furthermore, over and abovethe specified  programme conditions now proposed,  the Postmaster-General willcontinue to have the complete powers of control which he now possesses and willbe in a position to  take action if  the Companies misuse such liberty regardingprogrammes as they retain.             CONSULTATION WITH THE GOVERNORS OF THE B.B.C.    31.  We have  had the great advantage of representation  of  the  british broadcasting  Corporation  on  our , Committee  through  its  Chief Engineer,Sir Noel  Ashbridge, but we  have thought  it  inappropriate  at this stage  to approach the Governing Body of the Corporation.                             RECOMMENDATIONS.    32.  The following are our recommendations :       (i) The development of a wire broadcasting service on  a nation-wide scale           within two or  three years could only be achieved  by the provision of           the service free and the assumption by the Post Office of responsibility           for  the  development.   This course,  which would involve a  capital           expenditure of some  100,000,000 and annual charges of some millions           of  pounds, cannot  be regarded  as  a practical  proposition  (para-           graphs 3-5).     (ii) The present short-term arrangements for wireless broadcasting  in time           of war must also be regarded as the intermediate-term arrangements,           subject to such modifications as may result from further investigation           or technical development (paragraph 5).    (iii) In view of the great  advantages of a wire over a wireless system in the           event of war, every method of encouraging its development in peace           without   subsidy from the  Exchequer  should  be adopted  (para-           graphs 7-10).    (iv) Development should be effected (paragraph  11)            (a) through the expansion of the services at present provided by Relay                 Exchange Companies;           (6) through a Post Office Service over the telephone network.     (v) Relay  Exchange Companies.           (a) Licences for existing Companies  should be extended for 10 years                 to the 31st December, 1949 (paragraph 12), subject to conditions                 regarding programmes, connection by wire to  stations of the                 British Broadcasting Corporation, purchase by the Government                 and control in an emergency, set out in paragraphs 13-16, 17,                 18 and 19 respectively.           (b) Licences for new Companies should be terminable at the same date                 and be subject to the same conditions as in the case of existing                 Companies (paragraph 12). -  (vi) Post Office Service over the  Telephone Network.           (a) The service should be introduced first in districts most favourable                 to success, and should be  restricted,  in  the  first place, to                 telephone subscribers; but a reference to its possible extension                 eventually to non-telephone  subscribers should  be included in                 the initial announcement (paragraphs 20-22).           (b) The  service should be operated  on an economic  basis  without                 subsidy, probably at a cost to the subscriber of 25s. to 30s. per                 annum  (paragraph 23).    (vii) Electric Light Network. The Government should be prepared to assist           the electricity supply industry to  obtain powers to grant permission           to any licensed Relay  Company to use their lines on rental terms for           the transmission of broadcast programmes (paragraphs 24-26).
1.1(viii)  An announcement of the scheme for the development of wire broad-      casting should  be  made in  Parliament as  soon as  possible and,      should  contain  an indication that,  whilst  it  is  the intention  of      the Government to maintain wireless broadcasting in time of war, the;      service would be liable to some deterioration or occasional interruption      as a result of enemy jamming or other interference (paragraph 27).Signed on behalf of the Sub-Committee :           EUAN- WALLACE, Chairman.(Signed)C.

APPENDIX.  APPROXIMATE COST OF ESTABLISHING A NATION-WIDE  WIRE BROADCASTING                                  SERVICE.*    THE best estimate that can be made by the Post  Office of  the incidencebetween Urban and Rural areas  of the total capital  cost of schemes for serving8,000,000 subscribers  (excluding  J  million on  Relay exchanges) by wire broad-casting is as indicated below :                                                              Total                          Type of Service.               Capital Cost.                                           :  :                      1-J million telephone subscribers    ...     .......       6,250,000     \  million  non-telephone   subscribers  linked  to        telephone network      ...     ...     ...     ...       1,375,000    Balance of 6^ millions to be served by audio system    100,000,000Total   .........     ......    107,625,000                 or say...............    100,000,000    The distribution of telephone subscribers between Urban and Rural areas is approximately as follows :               85 per cent, in  Urban areas.             15 per cent, in  Rural areas.    It seems probable  that the proportion of wireless listeners in Rural areas is higher than the telephone proportion, though the latter figure which is based onrural areas no doubt includes some areas which are Urban in character.   In theabsence of any precise information  the assumption is made that the  proportionmay be of the order of 20 per cent.  On this basis and allowing for  the  highercosts  in providing wire broadcasting in Rural areas, the capital cost  is  verybroadly put at               65,000,000 in Urban areas.              35,000,000 in Rural  areas.    It is clear that the total cost could be materially reduced if  the extension tolisteners in  Rural areas was limited so  as  to exclude the less  accessible cases.There is, however, no basis for framing any estimate in figures of the possibilitiesof limitation on these lines.* Reproduced from Paper A.B.C.
