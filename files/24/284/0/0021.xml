COMMITTEE ON              THE SECRETARY OP STATE EDR FOREIGN AFFAIRSFOREIGN POLICY.                   suggested that, pending the arrival at theTHE international situation.         Meeting of certain telegrams which had been                   drafted, the Committee should he informed of                   certain Conclusions which had been provisionally                   reached on,the previous day.                          THE PRIME MINISTER reminded the Committee                   that at the Meeting of the Cabinet on the 20th                   March (Cabinet 13(39)  Conclusion 1, it had been                   decided to proceed on  the basis of the proposed                   Four Power declaration of consultation.   While the                   French had accepted our proposal,. and the Russians,.-                   though with some hesitation, had also  accepted it,.                   subject to its being accepted by France and Poland,                   Poland was unwilling to join, partly  because she                   wished to maintain her traditional policy of                   keeping a balance between Germany and Russia, and                   was consequently reluctant to join in any public                   declaration directed against Germany, and in                   particular because she feared that by joining with                   Soviet Russia in such  a declaration Germany would                   regard her as having passed definitely into the                   enemy camp, and this might well precipitate an                   attack on Poland by Germany.   Moreover, regard                   must also be had to Poland&apos;s inborn dislike and                   distrust of Soviet Russia..                         Poland had suggested that&apos; there should-be a                   confidential bilateral understanding between-eh- Great                   Britain and Poland by wMchtte-&quot;two-countries would &quot;bfe-bound
by the declaration, as though they had signed it,  butthe fact of the conclusion of this understanding wouldbe concealed; not only from the public?  but alsc fromthe French Government0   Poland feared that a disclosureto France would mean that the information would leak out,with highly deterimental consequences to herselfa       In the face of the attitude of Poland, it seemed that on this basis the best we could hope for would be       (l) a public declaration by Great Britain,  France&apos;           and Russia on the lines of our draft..       (2) A secret bilateral understanding to the same           effect between Great Britain and Poland and       (3) into this framework to fit the existing Franco-           Polish obligations of consultation and           assistance as provided for in the Franco-Polish           Treatyo       Even if we could agree to a scheme on these linesit was becoming clearer that our attempts to build up  a front against German aggression were likely to be frustrated if Russia was closely associated with thescheme.   We had recently received communications  both from poland and Roumania that any public association of Russiawith the scheme would greatly diminish and weaken theauthority of the common front * &apos;  Similar intimations hadbeen received from Finland, Yugoslavia,  Italy, Spain and portugal, and we had been warned that the inclusion ofRussia would     (1) Impede the construction of&quot;the front against         aggression.: since a number of our potential         associates were extremely reluctant to be         associated with Russia even for the purpose
hi X u        of resisting germany   (2)  Tend to&quot; consolidate the relations between-ttheparties        to the anti-Comintern Pact and make it less        likely that we would be able to exercise        influence on a:?.! establish good relations        with the weaker members of the Pact; namely,        Italy and Japan*    (3) Excite anxiety in such countries as Spain        Portugal and certain South American Republics.       It looked? therefore? as if a failure to associatewith Soviet Russia would give rise to suspicion and difficulty with the Left Wing both in this country and in france, while on the other  hand insistence to associate with Soviet Russia would destroy any chanceef building up a solid and united- front against german aggression.       In these circumstances it seemed thatsome alternative course must be found and that we mustabandon the policy of the Pour Power Declaration and concentrate on the country which, on the whole seemed likely to be the next victim of German aggression,namely * Roumani a *       Roumania was for the time being in a special position.She had considerable resources in oil and agricultural
9 4? of view she presented a great temptation to  Germany,  as her effective occupation and control by that country  would go far to neutralise what perhaps Germany most  feared, an effective naval blockade.       Moreover, if Germany got possession or effective- control of Roumania, she would be in a much  stronger position than she is at present successfully to attack and overrun Poland.    Poland herself would be wellnigh encircled and the moral effect on smaller States,  like Greece and Bulgaria, in South-Eastern Europe, would be far reaching.    Already there were signs that the  ease with which Germany was gaining her objectives had  begun to undermine the morale of those States and  diminish  their confidence in the power of the Western Democracies to assist them.       It would seem, therefore, that Roumania was  the country most likely to be attacked by Germany and  which would give her at the moment the greatest political and economic advantages.   If Roumania was effectively controlled by Germany, Poland would be in grave danger In her own interests, therefore, Poland might be preparedto come into/an agreement under which she would come to the  assistance of Roumania if Roumania&apos;s independence was threatened provided that Prance and Great Britain also  agreed to go to Roumania&apos;s aid.        The inclusion of Poland in the scheme was vital because Germany&apos;s weak point was her inability  at  present to conduct war on two fronts,  and unless Poland was with us Germany would be able to avoid this contingency.        Our first step should therefore be to approach Poland and Roumania and ascertain whether (a) if Poland
or Roumania are attacked directly or indirectly &quot;byGermany (e,g. in the case of Roumania with the connivanceof Hungary) they are prepared to resist.    (h) If so,Great Britain and. France would he prepared to support them.   It would be understood that as a counterpart forour undertaking to support Poland and Roumania, poland and Roumania should keep Great Britain and France fully informed of any developments threatening their independence.   (c) We should also ascertain whetherPoland was prepared to join in resistance in support of roumania if the latter was attacked by Germany and vice versa.   (d) Since Poland, unlike Roumania, has a Treatyof Mutual Assistance with France and is a strongermilitary Power than Roumania,  the undertaking under (&quot;b)above would be given as part of a reciprocal arrangementby which if France and Great Britain were attacked or ifthey go to war with Germany to resist German aggressionanywhere in Western Europe or in Yugo-Slavia, the PolishGovernment would support them.   It should be noted thatthis provision would apply to Poland and not to Roumania.       It would be observed that this plan left SovietRussia out of the picture.   In view of the effect of herinclusion on other States it would seem imprudent toattempt to bring Russia into the plan publicly.   Weshould have to explain to her that the objections to heropen inclusion come not from ourselves but from otherquarters,  and we should suggest that there should be asecret agreement between Russia and Great Britain underwhich Russia would come to the help of Poland or Roumaniain case either of these countries become  involved in warwith Germany.   The Franco-Soviet Pact might possibly
f -w i-J                                   ksecretly brought into the scheme.       It would he observed that the plan outlined abovedealt only with the Eastern front    Doubts had been expressed whether in point of fact Poland would beprepared to enter into the reciprocal arrangementsmentioned in (b) above,  i.e0 that if Prance or GreatBritain were attacked, the Polish Government would cometo their support.    If Poland declined to entertain a commitment of this kind then nevertheless we should beprepared to give her the unilateral assurance asregards the Eastern Front seeing that our object was to check and defeat Germany&apos;s attempt at world domination,       The Prime kinister added that he had nst so fardealt with   the position of Yugo-Slavia.   The idea wasthat Yugo-Slavia should be mentioned to Poland as another country to which assistance should be given inthe event of an attack by Germany threatening her independence.   If Poland showed reluctance to enter intocommitments vis a vis  Yugo-Slavia we should not undulypress her because on the whole a German attack onYugo-Slavia seemed unlikely, since such an attack wouldbe likely to bring Germany into conflict with Italy.In this connection the passage in Signor MussoliniTsspeech on March 26th., in which he referred to Italy&apos;sparamount interests in the Adriatic was no doubt intended for German consumption.       In conclusion, the Prime Minister emphasised thenecessity for urgent and immediate action.  He had not thought it expedient to summon an emergency meeting ofthe Cabinet to consider the new proposals, as this mighthave caused undue publicity.If the Foreign PolicyCommittee approved the course now proposed, the draft
                                                     o 9 -i                                                     (j l-J -despatched that evening, in the form adopted by theCommittee.     THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said thathe had  little to add. to the Prime Minister&apos;s summary ofthe discussions which had recently taken place.   He onlywished  to say a few words about the position of Yugo-Slavia.   His colleagues were no doubt well aware of thedifficulties of Yugo-Slavia&apos;s position placedin between Germany and Italy,     He (theForeign Secretary) had recently seen the Yugo-SlavianCharg&amp;  d&apos;Affaires, and. had made the point to him of thepossibility of a clash over Yugo-Slavia between Germanyand Italy.   The Charge d&apos;Affaires had pointed out thatthere were parts of Yugc-Slavia not bordering on the adriatic which would be of great value to Germany, and aboutthe fate of which Italy might be indifferent.   It was notout of  the question therefore that Germany and Italy mightcombine to menace and indeed to partition Yugo-Slavia.The Charg6 d?Affaires had. asked whether Yugo-Slavia couldcount on the same kind of support in the event of a threat to her  independence that we thought of extending to poland and Roumania.  In reply the Foreign Secretary had pointedout that Poland occupied a very special position, that wewere on the point of putting the whole problem to Poland,and that he could not answer the Charg  d&apos;Affaires&apos;  enquiryuntil we had received Poland&apos;s reply.     Reference had also been made to the question what assistance, if any,  Great Britain and France could give  toYugo-Slavia if the attitude of Poland to Yugo-Slavia provedindifferent.    Clearly this was a matter which would require
9 9 9Wcareful examination.   The Charge d&apos;Affaires had expressedthe opinion that if a front could &quot;be composed of GreatBritain, France and Poland other Powers, such as Yugo-Slavia, might adhere to it if given the opportunity.  Thisobservation had of course assumed that Poland would &quot;beready to enter a front of a general character.   It was by no means clear what the position would he if Poland declined to participate in a front of this kind.     THE HOME SECRETARY said that in effect the new proposals involved the dropping out of Soviet Russia fromthe scheme.   He fully realised the dilemma with which wewere faced, hut it must not he overlooked that the droppingout of Russia would be regarded in many quarters as aconsiderable defeat for our policy.   Would it not bepossible to arrange for some kind of parallel action,vis a vis Russia.     THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said thatthis possibility had been considered, and it had been thought that we might stimulate France to try to get rid of some of the embarrassing conditions in the Franco-SovietPact.   At the same time if we had to make a choice between poland and Soviet Russia, it seemed clear that Poland wouldgive the greater value.   It was imperative that at thepresent juncture we must not risk offending Colonel Beck.We should have to disclose to him any parallel arrangement with Russia which we had in mind, and he would no doubtargue that our proposal was a make-believe, the purpose ofwhich was to camouflage Russia&apos;s inclusion in the common front.   He would also point out no doubt that under the franco-Soviet Pact if France was involved in war russia would have to come in.   As regards the Labour Party he did
                                                          9 11                                                            6 \not think that there would he serious diffi.culty-provia.edwe could satisfy Labour that the exclusion of SovietRussia was no fault of ours.   Whatever explanation wasgiven to Soviet Russia about her exclusion she no doubtwould make mischief, &quot;but this should not have bad reactionshere if the position was fully and frankly explained tothe Leaders of the Labour Party.     THE HOME SECRETARY asked why Colonel Beck shouldobject if Prance cleared up the glosses and reservationsin her treaty with Russia.     SIR ALEXANDER CADOGAN said that under the existingFranco-Soviet Pact Russia was bound to go to France&apos;sassistance if Germany attacked France.   But if an arrange-ment were now to be made whereby if France went to warwith Germany on account of a threat by Germany to, say,Roumania,that would really involve Russian participation in the arrangements we were seeking to make with Poland.     THE HOME SECRETARY appreciated that Colonel Beckmight argue on these lines.   Had Pcland realised theimportance to herself of Soviet Russia as a source ofmunitions and other supplies?     THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS agreed thatthis was an important consideration.   It was proposed tosay to Colonel Beck that, while we would not press Polandagainst her will to join a pact which included SovietRussia, we would emphatically represent to him theimportance of Poland maintaining good relations with SovietRussia in order that in an emergency she might drawmunitions and other supplies from Russian sources.   Itshould also be remembered that Poland was not alone in                      -9-
objecting to the inclusion of Russia in the pact.    Othercountries such as Portugal and Spain, and Italy wouldbe influenced against us if we entered into anypact which included Russia.     THE HOME SECRETARY agreed with the validity, of these arguments as regards any new pact, but the position wasthat at the moment there was subsisting the Franco-soviet treaty, and we ought to endeavour to make the most of that treaty by altering and adjusting it.   No one could accusehim of any predilections in favour of Soviet Russia, buthe did attach very great importance to bringing in to thecommon front as many countries as possible.   He enquiredwhat was the attitude of the French Government on this sub ject?     THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said thatM. Bonnet, who of course had no love for Soviet Russia,thought that the Russians were very deceitful andunreliable, and would not in an emergency give much, ifany, effective help.   France seemed little interested inRussia, but attached the most vital importance to theinclusion of Poland, in the pact.   M. Bonnet, when inLondon, had expressed general approval of the proposals,but this had been on the basis of the Four Power Pact andnot in connection with some arrangement under which russia would be excluded from the common front, but brought inindirectly by means of the Franco-Soviet Treaty.     /&quot;&quot;At this point the draft telegrams reached the       Meeting and were handed round and read by the       Members of the Committee ,J
                                                      d IJ d       THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER Observed that it seemed to be assumed that Roumania was not so tied&quot;hand and foot&quot; by her Commercial Treaty with germany as to prevent her entering into the arrangements suchas were now contemplated..       THE PRIME MINISTER thought that the importanceof the German-Roumanian Treaty very largely depended on how it was worked in practice.   In certain circumstances the existence of this Treaty might strengthen Roumaniafspower to resist German aggression..       THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OP TRADE agreed withthe Prime Minister that according to how this Treatyoperated in practice it was either eyewash or completesurrender.   There were two matters to which he attachedimpo r t ance: -       (1) The agreement contained no .alt^irartdon  of-the         &apos;  existing rate of exchange rat6s-within-&apos; the           German-Roumanian Clearing and       (2) in the agreement Roumania-had not agreed to           any definite obligations as-to-the minimum           amount of Roumanian trade to^be done with           Germany in each year-       THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF DEFENCE pointedout that the military and political aspects of theRoumanian problem were different and might indeed beconflicting.   It had been assumed that Roumania
was likely to be Germany&apos;s next victim, but if germany had intended to overrun Roumania in thenear future itfeemed strange that she should start off by making this Commercial Treaty withRoumanian   It looked indeed as if Germany was proposing to launch an attack elsewhere andthat her object was to ensure that she couldcount on Roumania&apos;s oil and food supplies.At the same time he realised that Germany mightinstigate Hungary to attack Roumania in the hopethat she, Germany, might profit substantiallyfrom the outcome of the conflicts   So far as great Britain was concerned the worst that could happen  would be for us to get involvedin war without any allies on the Eastern Front.It should be our objective to endeavour toobtain the maximum possible amount of support in Eastern EuropeG   On the whole Poland was*from the military point of view, probably the best of potential eastern allies, but he  boughtSoviet Russia would act as a greaterdeterrent so far as Germany was concerned.
                                                      &amp; (J i      THE SECRETARY 05&apos; STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS referredto the recent appreciation of Russia&apos;s Military and air strength contained in the Despatch of H.Mo Ambassador at moscow of the 10tho March.   This appreciation intimated that while the Russian Army had been greatly weakened by recent purges and that its offensive value was small, itmight be expected to show good defensive qualities.    Asregards Air strength the appreciation was very discouraging,a substantial portion of the total number of Russian aero-planes were out of date and supply, etc.  arrangements would soon become chaotic in v/ar.      THE MINISTER FOR C0-0RDIN.ri.tion OF DEFENCE enquire whether the Foreign Office had received any similarappreciation in regard, to Poland1 s Military and Air position.       THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS thoughtthat there was nothing very recent.   The Polish Armyconsisted of some 50 Divisions and might be expected tomake a useful contribution0   A recent appreciation by our military Attache in Berlin had emphasized the point that inhis opinion Germany was not as yet in a position tosupport a war on two Fronts0       THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF DEFENCE hopedthat we should be very careful not to get drawn into anycommitments with Russia which might involve us in hostilities with Japanc   There was another consideration.Roumania was at present dependent on Germany for her military equipment which she obtained from the formerCzecho-Slovakiao   From this point of view she mustnecessarily be an unsatisfactory ally.   He could not help wondering whether from the military point of viewRoumania was worth the candle,-
                                                            o                                                         ^1 /v 0       THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION AFFAIRS pointedout that Roumania had &quot;been mentioned not ,-,o much as apossible ally but as the country which was likely to bethe next victim of German aggression,       THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS addedthat the nrral  effect on countries like Turkey, greece and Bulgaria of Roumania&apos;s subjection to Germany was ofgreat importance.       THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF DEFENCE assumed that so far as Eastern Europe was concerned Roumania wouldcount for something in a military sense.  The question was whether we could do anything effective on the West whichwould stop Poland and Roumania from being overrun andabsorbed by Germanyr.   For example,  would the number ofGerman troops which Poland and Roumania would draw offenable France successfully to attack and breach the                                            JSiegfried Line.   This aspect of the problem had not, sofar as he knew been examined from the military point - ofviewc       THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE reminded theCommittee that the Chiefs of Staff had recently expressedthe opinion that the independence of Roumania was of vitalimportance to us and that her subjection by Germany was an issue on which we must fighta       THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF DEFENCE pointedout that this appreciation by the Chiefs of Staff had been based on a possible German, ultimatum to Roumaniao    In the interval the situation had changed in as much as roumania had made a Commercial Treaty with germany   At the Meetingof the Cabinet on I8th0 March (Cabinet 12 (39) Conclusion l)he had conveyed to the Cabinet?  not his own views                those which on the problem    t-7the Chiefs of Staff had provisionally                      -14-
                                                   2 2 3reached in the very short  time available-       THE PRIi,3J MINISTER  pointed out the position thatwould  arise if we decided  to take no action in any circumstances in regard to Roumaniac  The German-Roumanian Commercial Treaty was now in existence.No doubt Roumania would endeavour to work that Treaty in her own interests-   Germany would at once represent  to roumania that the Treaty must &quot;be operated in the wayGermany desired.   If Roumania rejected this demandGermany would threaten her with compulsion,)   In theresult the position would- have been reached that germany would have compelled Roumania to sacrifice her independ-ence without any actual invasion or use of armed forces.It wouldy in fact, be an example of Germany&apos;s newtechnique..-       THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat he had been reflecting on the anxieties which hadbeen voiced by the minister for Co-ordination of Defence.He agreed that there was probably no way in which Franceand ourselves could prevent- Poland and Rov.ma.nia from being overrun.   We were faced with the dilemma of doing nothing, or entering into a devastating war.   If                                       awe did nothing this in itself would mean/great accession to Germany&apos;s strength and a great loss to ourselves of sympathy and support in the United. States, in the balkan countries, and in other parts of the worldo   In those circumstances if we had to choose between two great evilshe favoured our going to war       THE MINISTER FOR CO-OHDIKATION OF DEFENCE saidthat he agreed with this appreciation of the situationIn a sentence we were in a weak military position tomeet a political situation which we could, not avoid.
                                                     Cb S&quot;^ A                                                     &amp; 6 &apos;J       THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that ourprimary objective was to persuade Poland and Roumania to resist if attacked and to show them conclusively that ifthey did resist we would come to their assistance.    when this was generally known what prospect would it have of influencing Germany&apos;s view and attitude?       THE PRIME MINISTER observed that our diplomaticadvisers thought that the present proposals would greatlystrengthen the morale of other States and tend to bring them on to our side.       THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER enquired whatmeaning was to be attached to the words in paragraph 4(b)of the draft telegram to Warsaw and Bucharest &quot;If so GreatBritain and Prance would be prepared to support them&quot;.       THE PRIMS MINISTER pointed out that by manning theMaginot Line we should be holding up large German fGrceswhich otherwise would be available for overrunning poland and Roumania.    This argument applied both to the Eastand to the West and that was why we attached so much importance to the inclusion of Poland in the Pact.       THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS observedthat Poland was getting into an encircled position.Colonel Beck must be very uncomfortable and must realise that without the assistance of France and ourselves theposition of Poland was hopeless,  while with our assistancethere was some ground for hope.     -  THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS askedwhether the Staff Coiwersptrons had extended to this aspect of the problem.
                                                 S -&apos;. 1                                                  U       THE MINISTER POR CO-ORDINATION OP DEFENCE saidthat the Staff Conversations had covered matters suchas the number of troops which France and Poland couldmobilise,   Up till now he had discouraged theOhiefs of Staff from going too much into detailuntil decisions had been reached on the political aspects of the question.       THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs thought that the first sentence of paragraph 4 (b) ofthe draft Telegram meant that we should go to war,and if so he agreed that we ought to say so.-17-

At the Meeting on March 20th theCabinet had in effect agreed that we should consult with france, Russia and Poland &quot;with a view to determining thenature of any action that might be taken&quot;.   He did notthink that the new proposals contained anything which was                                              in this respect.in advance of decisions already reached by the Cabinet/     THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR DOMINION AFFAIRS drew attention to the words in paragraph 4 (a) of the draft telegram &quot;or may undermine these countries&apos; independence&quot;.These words seemed vague and indefinite, and moreovermight be regarded as inconsistent with what we had alreadypublicly stated in regard to Germany&apos;s right to reasonableexpansion.     THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE thought that thelast sentence of paragraph 4 (a) was the important one:-          &quot;Are Poland and Roumania prepared to resist           if their independence and integrity are           threatened in any of these ways?&quot;     THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION AFFAIRS asked whatwas to happen if Poland and Roumania did not resist.     THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS thoughtthat in such circumstances we could not be more Papal than

THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE thought that thelast sentence of paragraph 4 (a) was the important one:-          &quot;Are Poland and Roumania prepared to resist           if their independence and integrity are           threatened in any of these ways?&quot;     THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION AFFAIRS asked whatwas to happen if Poland and Roumiania did not resist.     THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS thoughtthat in such circumstances we could not be more Papal than
the Pope.   The knowledge that Great Britain andFrance would come to their support would undoubtedlystiffen Poland and Foiimania in resisting Germanattempts to undermine their independence.     THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTERreferred to paragraph 8 of the draft telegram andenquired whether in fact it would be possible to preserve secrecy in regard to the arrangements,particularly vis k vis Soviet Russia,    &apos; THE SECRETARY OF STATS FOR FOREIGN affairs said that a statement had been drafted for possible use in Parliament when the stage of Parliamentaryannouncement was reached.   It would, however, benecessary in advance for the Government to takevarious Parliamentary elements into their confidenceso as to obviate the asking of inconvenient andembarrassing questions, etc.     THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER feared that if it was essential to maintain secrecy in regardto arrangements vis a vis Russia, it might be verydifficult to ensure against any leakage.     THE PRIME MINISTER agreed that this would be so if our arrangements with Russia were reduced towriting.   It might therefore be necessary to havea gentleman&apos;s agreement with Russia of a verbalcharacter.   In practice leakage in Russia might be
                                                  2 3 -avoided because &quot;by tradition and habit the russians were well accustomed to procedure of this kind.     THE CHANCELLOR OP THE DUCHY OP LANCASTER recalled that Russia had favoured a large conference, and thatshe might react actively when she learnt that she wasto be excluded from the pact,     THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR FOREIGN affairs thought that alternatively Russia might sulk.     THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE feared thatthe exclusion of Russia was bound to have serious consequences.   Was it not possible to find some formof declaration in which Russia could join, whichwould not be open to the objections stated.   Russianpropaganda was representing that our policy was directed to pushing Germany into a conflict withRussia.     THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs pointed out that Germany could not in fact invadeRussia except through Poland or Roumania,     THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OF TRADE enquire whether it would be possible for us to have aseparate agreement with Russia to the effect that if either Great Britain or Russia were attacked inEurope, each would come to the other&apos;s aid.
       THE PRIME MINISTER agreed that this suggestionshould he examined, hut clearly no decision could be taken  upon it until we had received the reply ofPoland to the questions contained in the draft telegram.       THE HOME SECRETARY saw great difficulty in iexcluding Soviet Russia from the proposed Pact after all that had happenedo   As had been pointed outRussia constituted the greatest deterrent in theEast against German aggression^   All experience showed that Russia was undefeatable and he was apprehensive of the possible consequences that might result if at this juncture the enmity of SovietRussia towards this country was increased,,       THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR DOMINION affairs said that the Prime Minister of Canada had recentlyindicated his dislike of Russian participation in the pact *-       THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that the line which he had taken with Poland inregard to the Danzig question was that if Poland saw-fit to make some voluntary agreement with Germany inregard to Danzig we should raise no objection.   If,however, Poland was subjected to such pressure byGermany over Danzig as amounted to a threat to Poland&apos;independence then we would regard the matter as one in which we were interestedc       After some further discussion the Committee
agreed     (l) To approvef  generally,  the policy  proposed         by the Prime Minister and the Secretary  of         State for Foreign Affairs as outlined in the         statement made by the Prime Minister to  the         Gonnittoe and summarised in the opening pages         of these Conclusions *     (2) To invite the Secretary of State  for Foreign         Affairs in consultation with the  Chancellor         of the Exchequer to settle the final form         of the draft telegrams to Warsaw,  Bucharest         and Paris in the-light of the discussion at         the Meeting, and of certain amendments  and         alterations suggested by  Members of  the  Committ     (3) To authorise the Secretary of State  to         arrange for the dispatch, forthwith, of         the telegrams in their finally approved  form*/NOTE:  Copies of the telegrams as dispatched will be handed round at the Meeting of the Cabinet onWednesday, 29th March, 1939^7Richmond Terrace, S.W.I.,      27th March, 1939.
