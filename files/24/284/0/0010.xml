                   I.- INTRODUCTION                   Progress of Provincial Autonomy.    In an Appendix to this Survey will be found a summary of the legis-lation passed in the Governors Provinces under the new constitution upto the end of 1938.  A perusal of this will show  at any rate  the reality of provincial autonomy.   The  Legislatures have been  busy, and  among&apos;the enactments passed m  most Provinces  are some that bear unmistakably thestamp of a new regime.   Only popular Ministries could have fathered thelegislation which drastically affects landholders,  particularly  in their rela-tions with  their tenants, and creditors and  debtors; or  touches religion,for instance by  providing for the opening of Hindu temples to &quot;Harijans&quot; ;or commits Provinces  to &quot;prohibition&quot;; or restores to Congress followersthe lands they  forfeited  in  the civil  disobedience campaign.  The  formalintervention of  Governors has been rare; only three Bills have been returnedby Governors to the Legislatures for  amendment under   section 75 of theConstitution Act.  In only one instance has a Governor withheld his assent,and that Bill  had been introduced by a private member.    A large number of Bills have been reserved for the consideration of theGovernor General: but  the  reservation  has mostly  been for reasons of technical repugnancy  to  the provisions of existing Indian law: and in no case has the Governor General ultimately withheld his assent.    It must not, however, be deduced that Governors, the Governor  Generaland the Secretary  of State have  not  had  frequent occasion  for carefulconsideration of provincial  measures.   Though  the &quot;repugnancy&quot; provi-sions of the Constitution  Act have not hitherto- proved of material interest,those contained in section 299  of the Act and  in the Governors&apos; instrument of Instructions  as a  safeguard  against  unconscionable   expropriation of rights in land have given cause for much discussion and close examinationparticularly of agrarian measures.  Governors have in a number of instancesprevailed on their Ministers to modify features which appeared to go beyond what could be accepted1 without nullification of  the  safeguard, the  duty of preserving which has  hitherto proved   the  most  important  and the mostcontentious of Governors&apos; functions in  matters affecting the Legislatures.    2.  The history of the new constitution in the Congress Provinces hasbeen one of office  assumed,  and in some degree exercised, at the  biddingand under the control of  Gandhi  and  the right-wing leaders who interprethis will;  With all its inconveniences,  this, arrangement has  given theCongress Ministries some security from  fadtidus caprice and  dividedcounsel.  The close of the quarter saw  Gandhi,  while   engrossed in thestruggle which  is spreading among the States, suddenly confronted  with anapparent revolt  in  the Congress from the domination so confidently exercised by: himself and  his lieutenants.  The  meaning of this is still obscure: but from one cause or&apos; another possibly from Gandhi  losing control and theCongress organisation  swinging to the left, or possibly from an attempt tohold the  party  together by a  campaign on a wide  front  against  &quot;BritishImperialism&quot;-the next  few weeks  may  see  a  diversion of the forces of congress from the tasks of provincial administration.            II.-CONGRESS PROVINCES.                (a) Ministries: stability and reputation.    3. Assam. Although only the Premier and one other  member ofcoalition Ministry belong to the Congress party, it was formed under    405(S) SeoytoGGPubUo
 aegis of that party and its policy is likely to follow the Congress programme : Assam must now&quot;be counted as the eighth &quot;Congress  Province&quot;.  During the period between Bardoloi&apos;s formation of a cabinet (middle of September) and the meeting of the Assembly (December 1st ), the coalition  succeeded in winning over a few members of  the opposition; and the no-confidence motion, which had appeared likely to bring the Ministry down at its first appearance in the legislature, was defeated  by  a  margin of four votes. Bardoloi has insisted on the release of the few &quot;political&quot; prisoners,  but in general has not shown himself unreasonable.   In view of the Ministry s narrow majority and the proved fickleness of the legislature, the  outcome of the next session cannot be confidently predicted.     4.  Bihar. Although it appears to be generally agreed, both in Congress circles  and outside them, that the Ministry is not numerous enough to cope with its work, no  decision has yet been made to enlarge it.  The comfort of the Ministry is still threatened from the left (in both agrarian and labour agitation) and by communal discord.   Feeling between Hindus and muhammadan- madans has  not  been improved by  the Patna  Conference of the Muslim.&apos; League at the end of December: and the preservation of   public order is likely to be  tested during  the Bakrid  celebrations  at the beginning of February.     The  rivalry between Bengalis and Biharis   has  not been settled. Rajendra  Prasad&apos;s report  on this  controversy  has been   considered and accepted by the Congress Working Committee.   The general principles are that identical treatment should  be given to Biharis and Bengali-speaking residents in  Bihar, and that all persons holding appointments under Gov- ernment must be treated alike.  It remains to be seen whether these con- clusions can be so  applied as to remove  discontent.     5.  Bombay. The Ministry&apos;s determination&quot; in tackling any threat to law and order was again demonstrated during the attempted general strike in Bombay city in  November.  The Ministry  is firmly seated in the saddle; while claiming to adhere to Congress principles  and the party programme, it  is generally regarded as preserving  successfully the momentum of pre- autonomy  government.     6.  Central Provinces. -The Maharashtra revolt has collapsed; Khare- seems to have made his exit  from the political stage.   No more  has been heard of Dr. Raghavendra  Rao.   The empty  places in  the Ministry remain unfilled.  Ministers were previously so much occupied with, party dissen- sions that they had little time for  administration; they have found a fresh- diversion in the preparations  for the next session of the All-India  Congress, which is to be held in this Province in March.  Budget prospects are gloomy.     7.  Madras. Raman Menon, Minister for Courts and Prisons, died on January 3rd.  He  was a competent Minister whose loss will be felt.  His place has been filled by an Indian Christian, C. J. Varkey.     There are signs from  various quarters of  challenge to the Premiers supremacy.  The anti-Hmdi  agitation  is   by  no  means  dead  - and  the distrust of Brahmans which  is at the bottom of it has helped to produce symptoms of an awakening of the non-Brahman (&quot;Justice&quot;) party from its lethargy under incompetent leadership  since  the general election    From within  the Brahman  community S.  Srinivasa Ayyangar (an  ex-President of  the All-India Congress  who retired  from politics as a  protest  against gandhis leadership) has emerged to attack the Ministry : though he himself is not a likely champion of a forlorn hope,  he  may&apos;   rally  discontented elements.   Again,  the report recently published by the Committee of the legislature appointed  to examine conditions in the zamindaris is believed to be a serious inconvenience to the  Premier, both from the extravagance of its proposals on behalf of  the tenants and from their being sponsored by  the  Revenue Minister   (Prakasam)  as  Chairman  of  the  Committee. Prakasam  is an Andhra : and the undercurrent  of Andhra restlessness and intrigue may  explain  the Premier&apos;s  unwillingness  to   accept as final the refusal of the Secretary of State to consider the proposal  for a  separateAndnra Province (see  para. 7 of the last Survey).
 -    8.  North-West  Frontier  Province. Gandhi&apos;s visit to  the  Province, which ended early in November, does not appear to have strengthened the position of the  Congress.   Hindus  were  disappointed because he&apos; did nothing to redress their grievances, and they failed to appreciate his  non- violent prescription for combating frontier  raids.  Muslims were not  im- pressed.  Gandhi is believed to have taken the Ministers to task in private, but his public utterances were not critical of them.     During the November session of the Assembly, Government on several occasions escaped defeat by a margin of only three votes.   Three Ministerial supporters deserted, but the opposition still lacked the necessary cohesion to make a determined attack.  Bribery is said to have been used in enticing away a Muslim Ministerialist whose defection the opposition hope will enable them to upset the Ministry in the next session.  The opposition has formally assumed the name of the Muslim League coalition party.     9.  Orusa. This  Province, from  which agitation in the neighbouring States has been fomented, is also the resort of some thousands of  States subjects who are alleged to have been driven from their homes by repression and of agitators  whose extradition is demanded by the  States.  Though the shock of Major Bazalgette&apos;s murder (see para. 84) induced the Ministry to allow provincial police to be sent into Ranpur State, and though they have used  their influence behind the scenes to  damp  down   agitation  in  the Province, their unwillingness to assist the Rulers  by overt forms  of co- operation still makes conflict  possible with the  Governor and Governor- General.     10.  United Provinces. Until  the Tenancy  Bill, which  is  still under discussion  in the  Assembly,  takes its final form, the Ministry&apos;s future is bound to he uncertain. At present the radical elements, though powerful, are subordinate to the right-wing direction of the Premier.  But the  pro- vincial Congress Committee is both further to the left, and more assertive m its attitude towards the Ministry, than in other  Congress Provinces :  and pressure from the extremist forces  in  the  fields of  agrarian and  labour agitation may shake the authority of the Premier or drive him further than he wants to go in concession to subversive influences.                 (b) Legislatures: events of the  sessions.                 g     11. A summary of all the legislation passed in  Governors&apos;  Provinces during the period  between  the introduction of Provincial Autonomy and the end of the year 1938 will be found in Appendix III.   It is intended to issue annual supplements.     12. Assam. The Legislative Assembly met, as  arranged, on December 1st.   The session was brief.  As mentioned above, the Government defeated the no-confidence motion by four votes on December 8th.   On  the 6th  the Assembly passed a Bill reducing Ministers&apos; salaries to the level prevailing in other Congress  Provinces.     13. Bihar. The Legislative&quot; Assembly  began a session  on January 16th, and the Council on January 23rd.  A Bill has been, passed to  amend the Moneylenders&apos; Act of  1938,  by repealing and re-enacting a section of that Act which the Patna High Court had held to be invalid, on the ground that under section 107 of. the Government of India Act the Bill should, have been reserved for the consideration of the Governor-General.   The intention is that the new Bill shall be so reserved.    14. Bombay. The sessions of the Legislative  Assembly  and Council which-were in progress at the beginning of November ended on November 17th.  The Trades Disputes Bill was passed by the Assembly on November 4th, by the Council on November 15th with some amendments,  and again by the Assembly on November 17th.   The  Tenancy Bill was  formally introduced.     15. Central Provinces.-There has been no session of  the  LegislativeAssembly.                           I
     16. Ma.dras.-The Legislature sat from  November 28tb to  December 12th.   The most important Bills  passed were the Malabar Temple Entry Bill and a Bill which enables the Government to divert to general revenues any excess over 20 lakhs of rupees in the Minor Ports fund.  The Legis- lature  held a second session from  January 17th to 27th, during which an important Public Health Bill was  passed.&apos;  There was a seven days&apos; debate in the  Assembly on  the  Estates  Land  Act  Enquiry Committees report. (See para. 67).                                       J     17. North-West  Frontier Province. The Assembly held a session from November 3rd  to the 22nd.  The Government  defeated a series of adjourn- ment motions by a margin of  only three votes;  one motion  was to discuss the failure of the authorities to combat the Bannu raid; another discussed the curtailment by Government of the liberty of the press.  The Prohibition Bill was finally passed, and the Agricultural Debtors&apos;  Relief  Bill; also a Bill to  fix the allowances of Members of the Assembly.     18. Orissa. There has been no session of the Assembly.    T9. United Provinces. The Legislative  Assembly met on November 10th, and,  with intervals  for holidays, sat throughout the quarter : the session  was still proceeding at the end of January.   The Tenancy Bill has occupied nearly all its time, and has not yet been passed.  Prom December 1st to the 5th a joint session was  held of both Houses  of the Legislature, to consider the  Stamp  and Court  Fees Amendment Bills, about  which no agreement could be reached independently.  This is the first  ioint session to have been held in India under  the new  constitution.   Both Bills were passed  by a large majority.  The Stamo Amendment Bill has been reserved for the consideration of the Governor-General.    (e)  Relations of  Ministries with the Central Congress Command.    20. In the  last  Survey (para.  18) mention was made of contemplated arbitration by the High Command in the agrarian legislation of the U. P. and Orissa the pending  Tenancy  Bill in the  former and in the latter the Bill which has been reserved for the consideration of the Governor-General. The opposition  of the  Oudh landowners led  the Congress  Parliamentary Sub-Committee  to refuse intervention in  the United  Provinces.  Rajendra Prasad, the member  of the Working Committee who has been designated for arbitration in Orissa, has been prevented by illness  from taking it up, but is expected  to give his attention to it in the near future.    The Working Committee accepted generally the principles recommended by Rajendra Prasad for settling the conflict of Bihari and Bengali interests in Bihar, and have   advised that  they should be  made  the basis of a settlement.    There has been controversy about the distribution of revenues between the Central Provinces and Berar.   The  Governor has a special  responsi- bility under section 52  (2) of the  Constitution  Act  for securing that a reasonable share of the revenues  of the Province is expended in or for the benefit of Berar.  In March 1938,  Berar  members of the Assembly showed dissatisfaction with the distribution, and Khare, who was then the Premier, appealed to the Congress  President  to arbitrate.  In  April the question was placed before the Working Committee, who deputed Vallabhai Patel to arbitrate; later this  duty was delegated to Mr. Aney,  a Berar leader.When preparation of the budget  for  1939-40 was  in  hand the question again became a  live  issue.  In December, Patel, Aney  and the Ministersmet for discussion of the  problem and asked the Finance Secretary to the Central Provinces Government to be present;  as he was1 well qualified toadvise,  the Governor raised  no objection.  The  formula suggested by theFinance Secretary was  adopted;  and if it appears to meet  the wishes ofthe Berar members of the Assembly the Governor, who regards it as suitable,is likely to give  it his sanction.    The Working Committee continue to  dictate  policy on questions ofall-India importance.  They are reported  recently  to  have  framed  for
  Congress Ministries an &quot;instrument of instructions&quot;  as to the manner in  which they should treat the Muslim minority.  When the Income-Tax Bill  was pending before the   Central  Assembly,  Vallabhai  Patel urged all  Provincial Governments  to demand certain amendments in it,  and some  of  them complied.   The  support he gave to the Bombay  Government in  the labour riots  of  November 7th  strengthened  their hands  against  the  forces of the left wing.   The Orissa Ministry are known to have been in  close  touch with the High Command regarding the measures to be taken in  connection with the  States agitation.   Gandhi&apos;s  peremptory  insistence on  more  rapid progress towards complete &quot;prohibition&quot; is undoubtedly pushing  some  Ministries further along this. expensive course than, if left to them-  selves, they would be willing to go.     Mention is made in para. 91 beloW of the &quot;National Planning Com-  mittee&quot;  which has emerged from a conference of Congress Ministers  for  Industries.  The Bombay Minister returned from the conference with  the  report that the Congress President  had  appointed  the  Committee with  representatives of the Congress  Governments on  it.   The Ministry wrote to the President pointing  out that it was hardly proper for him to appoint  such  representatives,  and  that the proper course would  be  to ask Govern-  ments to make their own  appointments.   It is understood that  other Gov-  ernments  took  the same  line.   Subhas Bose further  announced that  the Provinces participating in the Committee&apos;s  work would, contribute towards the necessary  expenses.   Giri,  the Madras Minister, in  his capacity  as convener,  wrote  to  each  Province  asking  for  &quot;its first  instalment of Rs. 1,000&quot;.  The United Provinces agreed to give Rs.  1,000  as a grant- in-aid to a useful investigation,  and the money was found from the Indus- tries&apos;  budget.   The  Government of  Bihar  also paid up Rs.  1,000.   The Government of Bengal expressed1 considerable  resentment at  the attempt of the Congress &quot;High Command&quot; to set itself up as a parallel authority, and the Finance Minister  was of the opinion that the reply should contain a protest  that the plan had been started without consulting  the Govern - ment from whom assistance was asked.  It is not known how other Provinces responded.     21. The &quot;Vidya Mandir&quot; Scheme, In the Central  Provinces Muslim feeling against the   &quot;Vidya  Mandir&quot;  scheme  (which owes its origin to Gandhi&apos;s dictation) has been increasing in bitterness; against the advice of the provincial Muslim League some Muslims  decided to  start civil dis- obedience  in protest; and  on  January 26th  (&quot;Independence Day&quot;),  which was the day fixed for the inauguration of a number of  the new schools,  ten Muslims marched to the Nagpur Secretariat to commit satyagraha, and were removed by the police; on subsequent  days parties of Muslim  volunteers courted arrest  in the same manner, defying the magistrate^ order to dis- perse.   A number have been arrested.   The enthusiasm of the Premier for the scheme has led him into proposals which, if accepted,  would have inten- sified the opposition to it.     On December 4th  the Council of the all-India Muslim League appointed a sub-Committee to consider the  scheme and investigate the  possibilities of a separate system of education  for Muslims: nothing has  yet been heard of its activities.   The Central Advisory Board of Education has considered the report on the scheme submitted by a sub-committee,  and has accepted&apos; the recommendations  generally and decided to send copies of the report to Provincial Governments for consideration.    The  Governments  of Bihar, Bombay and Orissa, are reported to have decided to start the scheme experi- mentally in the near future. (d)  relations  of  Ministers with Governors:  social  contacts:  special                            responsibilities.    22. Relations  between  Ministers and  the Governor and officials in theCentral Provinces have  improved considerably;   the  beginning  of this tendency was mentioned in  paragraph 21 of the last Survey.    405(S) SeoytoGGPublic

The Government of the Central Provinces issued  a  notification inDecember,  asking the public not to make representations  direct to Minis-ters, but to take their grievances to the district authorities.    In paragraph 24 of the last Survey mention was made of disclosure of official records in this Province.  A further instance is the publication in a local newspaper of photographs of a confidential report submitted bya Superintendent of Police about an abduction  case  in which  a Minister(Misra) was said to have been concerned.  The case dates  back to the time before  Congress took office, and the report came into the hands of Khare,the ex-Premier,  while he was in office:  he is suspected of  having shown itto the press in order to discredit Misra.       III.-NON-CONGRESS   PROVINCES.                (a)  Ministries:  stability and reputation.    24. Bengal. In an attempt to strengthen the  precarious  position ofthe Government, the Premier has enlarged the cabinet by the addition oftwo new Ministers.   One, Shamsuddin Ahmed, is the leader of the KrishakProja  party, and is expected to bring four votes  with him; the ether,Tamizuddin Khan, is the leader  of the Independent Proja party, who maybring another 8 votes.   The Proja parties represent generally the  peasantinterests.   The Krishak Proja party by no  means  unanimously approved the appointment of- Shamsuddin, and  has since &quot;directed&quot; him to intro-duce various forms of legislation as a condition of his  remaining in theMinistry.    Congress intrigue, and  efforts  towards   the formation of a coalition government, have continued.  Much speculation  arose from the conduct ofSarkar (Finance Minister) :  when in December he paid a visit to Gandhi,Nehru and Vallabhai Patel,  his previous connection  with  Congress wasnot forgotten, and it was surmised  that he was lending  himself to theintrigue :  but nothing came of it except an emphatic  denial from Sarkarof any negotiations for a coalition.   It  is  said that Gandhi has  advisedSubhas Bose to abandon the attempt  to form a coalition as  Congress hasnot.the requisite strength in Bengal to impose its programme on any Ministrythat could he formed.   The Congress  party in  the Province is still rentby faction.    25. Punjab. A few defections among Government supporters  and theestablishment of  an  Independent party  numbering  about nine have not seriously weakened  the  Ministry&apos;s position.   Further  agrarian legislation has been received with the same modified hostility from Congress, governedas they are by urban interests.    Provincial finances  have  been seriously affected by expenditure on famine relief in the  south-eastern areas,  anddrastic economy will be necessary as well as some  new form of taxation.    26. Bind. The  Ministry has had unexpected success  in  weatheringthe storm.&apos;  Towards the end of November, the Premier again parleyed withVallabhai Patel,  who is believed not to be  opposed  to the Lloyd Barrageassessment proposals; Abul Kalam Azacl,  who maintains his opposition tothe proposals, could not be  present at the negotiations, and  nothing  cameof them.  The Congress demand was that the orders should be postponed for one year, and should then  be modified  in consultation with the  SindCongress  Committee.  In January, when the Assembly  met  for the first time since last June, the long-expected motion of no-confidence, after  three days&apos; debate, was defeated  by 32 votes to  7; Congress remained  neutral,
   in spite of the Premier having repeated his inability to postpone the orders;   and oir Gnulam Husam (ex-Premier) caused surprise  and speculation by   resigning his leadership  of  the  Muslim  League and  of the opposition on   the opening day of the debate.  Dissatisfied with the attitude of the Muslim   -League, he secretly expressed his readiness to join the Ministry, with some   of his  followers; the  consideration for this  support  is to  be&apos; an increase   m the number of Ministers to five or six.   Two  Ministries in succession   have been unable to do anything effective because of their feeling; of in-   secunty, and it is hoped that this coalition will  enable  the Ministry to   formulate and execute a progressive  policy.    The new coalition and&apos; the   increase in the number of Ministers are not.to  be  announced till  a date in  February.      Later, on January 25th, a Congress resolution (supported by the Muslim  League) on the assessment proposals was defeated by 30 votes to 20; the  Premier announced some slight modifications.      The Ministry is  unique in refusing allegiance to  either Congress or  the Muslim League : its adoption  of many items  of the Congress programme  has not destroyed its  independence,  and its antipathy  to  the League is  remarkable in a Province  where Muslims  are in the  majority.    In its  existing form it is probably  not  so secure as  the result  of  the recent trial  of strength would suggest,  for  resistance to  demands  for abandoning  increased taxation has no popular appeal.                  (b) Legislatures: events of the  sessions.      See Appendix III  for the legislation passed up to  the end of 1938.      27.  Bengal. -There has been no session of  the Legislature.      28.  Punjab. The Legislative Assembly held a session from November  10th to December 2nd,  and another special session commencing on January  9th, summoned to continue   consideration of   the Agricultural  Produce  Markets Bill.  The first session came  to  an abrupt conclusion before this  Bill had been passed; the Opposition adopted dilatory tactics and eventually  forced from the Speaker a ruling of doubtful validity about the days on which the House could sit: at the Premier&apos;s  suggestion the  House then  adjourned sine die.   The Bill was passed on January 24th : the session ended the same day.     Both sessions have   been  marked  by  scenes of disorder;. the  level of parliamentary  behaviour in the Punjab  has proved to be well below  the average.   Towards the end of January the Government  introduced a Bill providing for  the appointment of  a Ser^eant-at-Arms;  the object of this is to give the Speaker assistance in enforcing discipline; the Bill was  strongly opposed,  but the motion to refer it to Select Committee was carried.     29.

Mention was made in paragraph 33  of  the   last  Survey of thetendency in Bengal for  officers to approach Ministers and  politicians directfor favours.  In November the Government warned subordinate officers thatthey are liable  to disciplinary  action if  they  try   to approach  Ministersotherwise than through  the proper official  channels.    Another order  laiddown that any memorial against dismissal submitted by a subordinate officerwill be referred to the Public Services Commission before a Minister dealswith it;  and if it is to  be  considered seriously, it will be brought  to thenotice of the Governor before final  orders are passed.
    The Punjab Premier, who is feeling the strain of incessant work and heavy responsibility,  has  suggested to  the Governor  that he should be assisted by an I.

There is nothing of interest to report about events in. the AndamanIslands,  Coorg or Panth Piploda.-   The further history of the communalunrest in Delhi is described in paragraph   81.  The  Province  has  beensuffering from the wrost drought in living memory, and of the last instal-ment  of land revenue amounting to Rs.  1,81,000,  the collection of no lessthan Rs. 1,31,000 has had to be suspended.   Conditions in the rural areasof Ajmer-Merwara also are such as to cause much hardship.              V.-GENERAL  SUBJECTS.              (a) Treatment of Services: Service  feeling.    33. This subject is one on which it is difficult to add matter with the certainty of conveying a correct impression.   To quote particular incidentsthat come to notice may  have the  effect of stressing  what is  not typical  :and only from time to timers material available  for an estimate even of conditions in one Province.  The appendix  to Survey  No.  A (May 1st to july 31st 11938) gave an analysis of data received in reply to the Governor-General&apos;s enquiry from Governors about the strain placed on the services by the circumstances of Provincial Autonomy :  in a general way it wouldprobably be safe to say that, since that material was  supplied, the stressesdue to adaptation of the old machine to new conditions have diminished  :the machine is being &quot;worked in&quot;.  This accords in fact with the forecast of most of the Governors  at that time.   But  there are circumstances which require caution in deducing that the process of adaptation is on the way to satisfactory achievement.   First, the strain has naturally  been  felt  mostby the senior officers, on  whom generally the greater responsibility falls:and if these on their retirement and a number are likely to  retire before they would have done under the old conditions are not replaced by officersof equal ability and enterprise, the machine will suffer a permanent weaken-ing.   (It is unfortunate  that the  circumstances which prevented normalBritish recruitment to the more important Services  during and for a whileafter  the Great War have left a gap just where present  conditions speciallycall for strength).   Secondly, it may be found, at any rate in some Provinces,that much more is expected of the Services  than an  adjustment  here andthere in the performance of their duties.  The requirement of a  &quot;changedattitude&quot; on their part is in some  degree inevitable, and one to which theworking  of  the new constitution demands obedience :  but  if  it goes,  orthreatens to go, to the length of reducing the officials of the key Services tononentities,  subservient to the will of persons wielding political influence,the results will be serious not only for the Services but also for the work-ing out of the democratic principles which are erroneously  supposed  torequire a weakening of the administrative arm of Government.   (It is fair to add that among&quot; the Ministries which avoid this error are some of theCongress Ministries).  Again,  the motive of retrenchment   mav producedisturbing results.  Under the present constitution,  revenue tends to slipawav with sometimes alarmins facility.   Apart from, definite items  of apolitical programme-such as &quot;prohibition&quot;, or reduction of rents with con-sequent reduction  in the ability of landholders to  pay revenue to Govern-reassessment -the vagaries of the season and natural calamities cause demands for
 iemissions or expenditure which responsible Ministers can with difficulty resist.   With tailing revenues,  the temptation to economise by an  inroad on the pay and allowances of the Services is strong : and a deterioration in the nuances of the  Provinces may become one of the main threats  to the effi- ciency and contentment of their servants.     The  difficulty of gauging  feeling in the Services may  be  illustrated by enquiries recently made in one of  the  Congress Provinces.  In some quarters it was  stated that apprehension is widespread, that administrative standards are deteriorating in  consequence, and  that there  is a  general desire to get, or keep, out of trouble by any means possible.  In other quar- ters the view expressed was strongly reassuring : it was denied that officials are generally apprehensive: things are settling down well:  even  though some deterioration is inevitable it will not  be serious, and there is hope that in the next few years relations between the permanent Services will settle themselves on lines satisfactory  to both.   With such conflicting views, it is probable that the truth lies somewhere between them.     34. The movement for  the suppression of corruption in the  Services is a  matter  where cordial approval of the aim must be&quot; tempered with  caution m  accepting suggested measures.  Previous Surveys  have  mentioned  the apparatus set up  in the United Provinces.   The objectionable features of this are said to have been. somewhat mitigated.  The Punjab Government have now decided  to form a staff of trained  investigators to assist heads of departments in  dealing  with   complaints.  The Madras Premier,  when questioned in the Assembly on the subject of corruption, stated that   his Government had no intention of appointing an anti-corruption officer, and would not &quot;commit the obvious  error of distrusting their officers without adequate proof&quot;.    The Bihar Corruption Enquiry  Committee has recently published its  report.   This deals with every department of Government and analyses the extent, and the causes, of corruption which  it finds to exist in greater or  less degree in  almost  all departments,  and not to be wholly confined  to the lower ranks : the culprits include some members of the Provincial Services and even some members of the all-India Services. Proposed  remedies of general application include, increase in the  pay of the subordinate clerks and peons; the appointment of a  standing  Provincial Committee consisting of heads of departments and non-officials  nominated by Government; and the appointment of a special officer  of high rank inone locality as an experimental  measure,  to report suspected  instances ofcorruption and  to help heads  of offices and departments  and the general public in  suppressing the practice.    35&apos;. In  the  Central Provinces relations between Ministers and bothcivil and  military officers are reported to have much improved.   nothing more has  been heard of the Bilaspur  election enquiry.  In  Madras Raja-gopalachari again expressed his appreciation of the work  done by the  Ser-vices in a speech which he made as a guest at the St. Andrew&apos;s Day&apos;s dinner.The N.-W.. F. P.  Government  have under consideration the total abolitionof lambardars, village officials whose office is hereditary and one of whosechief duties is to collect the land revenue, and their replacement by a specialstaff of revenue collectors.   The reason given for this proposal is  that itis  essential to check corruption, but the real object  is in some degree poli-tical, because lambardars do not support  the  Ministry, alienated as theyhave&apos;been by the general attack on the position of the Khans.    The Punjab is  probably the Province where the pre-autonomy condi-tions of service  have suffered least change : yet even here  the Premier has .recently complained that permanent officials have caused difficulties to theMinistry by failing to appreciate fully the implications of the new consti-tution : some of the more senior officers resent what they  regard as undueinterference by Ministers and do not. make allowances for the exigences of party government: local officials do not suffer gladly requests of Ministerialsupporters,  and are not always scrupulously loyal to Ministers in casual    405(S) SecytoGGPublie
conversation : moreover a certain type of Hindu official works in subtle waysto embarrass or discredit the Ministry.    36. Separation of judicial and executive functions. No definite pro-gress has yet  been made with the  schemes prepared in Bihar  and U. P-which were mentioned in paragraph 39 of the last Survey.   In Bombay theMinistry have decided  to  postpone consideration of the proposal for thepresent.  The Sind Re-organisation  Committee recommended that a  startshould be made, and  have, suggested  a scheme of modified  separation.    37. Abolition of  posts. On the  advice  of the  Government of India,the Secretary of State has  approved the  proposal to abolish one of the twoposts of Commissioner  in  Assam, on the understanding  that his sanctionmust not be taken as pre-judging in any way the  question of continuing thesystem of Commissioners generally.   The post is likely to be abolished  fromthe 1st of April  1939.   Although political changes were responsible forthe proposal being made, past history supplied some authoritative support for the recommendation.  The policy  of the Secretary of State remains as itwas : he is prepared to consider on the merits  any proposal for reducing aparticular  post of Commissioner, but the view is still held that the systemof Commissionerships cannot be abandoned wholesale without serious detri-ment to the efficiency of the administration.  It is recognised that the needfor Commissioners Would be especially felt if  the Governor had to resumecontrol  under  section 93 of the  Government of India Act.    Early  in November, the United Provinces Ministry took up the questionof abolishing  Commissioners, and  a  formal proposal for the abolition ofall the posts is expected.   The Bombay  Ministry proposed that one of the posts of territorial Commissioners should be abolished and replaced  by  a commissioner for Rural Reconstruction, but soon abandoned the idea.  TheMinister in charge of rural reconstruction preferred to have a more juniorofficer to do the work :  and when it was known that a particular division was to  be  selected for the abolition  of the Commissioner,  resentment was shown in that locality.   One of the Ministers favours the abolition of allCommissioners, but his colleagues show no great keenness  for this, and havenot questioned the validity of the  objections taken to it by the Governor.The report of the Bihar Retrenchment  Committee, most of whose recom-mendations&apos; Were mentioned  in paragraphs 40 and 42 of the last Survey,suggested that instead of  Commissioners the-Board of Revenue should be abolished and  its work entrusted to the Commissioners; they calculated thatthe saving would be greater thereby than if  Commissioners were abolished.     The Madras  memorandum  recommending   the  abolition  of the civilbranch  of the  Indian Medical Service has been forwarded to the Secretaryof State with advice that it should be rejected.    38. Pay and Allowances. The  Sind Re-organization Committee has produced a comprehensive  report recommending  inter alia that the IndianCivil and Indian Police Services should be completely provincialised withinthe space of 10 years; reductions, in some cases  drastic,  in the pay of offi-cers of the Provincial Services;  the  total abolition of the Sind allowancepaid  to officers as compensation  for the bad climate; the revision  of allhouse-rent concessions; that compensatory allowance  for the high  cost ofliving in Karachi should be paid only to officers drawing Rs. 350 per men-sem or  less; and a revised scale of special  pay.    Consideration of  theseproposals does not appear  to have  been pressed.     The United  Provinces Ministry  have produced  a complete scheme ofnew scales  of pay  for new entrants to the Services under their control; theyinvolve a considerable reduction of the present scales.  Late in January thePremier was enquiring as  to the effect of a ten per cent, cut in the pay ofGovernment servants  in case the Provincial revenues suffered a heavy lossas a  result of bad harvest.  It is  understood  that he does not propose topress this  point.  Detailed proposals will shortly  come before  the  Bengal
 SerSces^ reduCtion in the scales of Pa7 for new entrants to the Provincial red^^T was.^ade in Paragraph 42 of the last Survey of proposals for reduction of special pay m Bihar and the Central Provinces.  No progress in tne  consideration of those proposals has been reported.   This matter nas  come to a head m the United  Provinces.  The  Premier accepted the secretariat proposals, which  make reductions in  special pays and compen- satory allowances yielding an annual saving of about Rs. 1,05,000 in the former and Rs,  1,06,000 in the  latter.   So far as the proposals affect the Secretary of State&apos;s Services  his sanction is required.   The proposals are Tiow before the Governor.   In the North-West Frontier Province proposals for  reduction of special pay have been formulated.  In prolonged  Cabinet discussion the Ministers, who at first proposed drastic reductions, accept- ed the need for examining each case on its merits,  and in the end decided on cuts which the Governor considers justifiable.  As regards the Secretary of State&apos;s Services, the Ministers are  unlikely to put forward proposals  for the consideration of the Secretary of State unless they are sure  of the Gov- ernor&apos;s support.                                  &apos;                      \     With regard to travelling allowance, the  C. P. Ministry are pressing a proposal similar to that made  by the Bihar Ministry (see para. 55 of Survey No.  4 and para. 42 of the last Survey) which was the occasion for the Secre- tary of State taking the matter into  consideration.  In January the Secre- tary of State made  rules which provide that the travelling allowances admis- sible to his civil officers holding reserved posts or military officers appointed to civil employ shall be regulated by the rules in force on January 1st, 1939, and  that no alteration which would operate  to their disadvantage shall have effect save with his approval :  the  Governor in his  individual judg-ment, or (in the transitional period) the Governor-General in Council, as the case may be, shall determine any question that may arise whether an alter- ation does  so operate.     The Government of Assam were compelled to order a 10 per cent, cut in travelling allowance, as a temporary expedient, in November,  because the financial outlook was so gloomy.  The Premier of  Madras, on being told  that the  Governor&apos;s special responsibility. was attracted,   abandoned with a bad grace the proposals for reducing- travelling allowance which were mentioned  in paragraph 42 of the last Survey.    The Sind Reorganisation Committee have  made  reasonable recommendations for the reduction  of travelling allowance; amongst other things they propose that all All-India Service officers, and officers of Provincial  Services drawing Rs. 1,000 or more, shall still  be included in the  first  grade, i.e.,  they  will  continue todraw first class railway fares.  Previously  all Government servants draw- ing over Rs. 750 per month were placed in the first grade.     The Madras Ministry have agreed that their orders depriving medical officers under their control of  the privilege of engaging in private practice shall not take effect until  the beginning of 1940; women doctors are to be exempt from this prohibition; but  the  Premier now proposes to demand from officers statements showing  the  amounts received as consultation fees, of which 15 per cent, will have to be paid  into the Treasury.     The same  Government published a scheme for a Nursing Service onreduced scales of pay which was to include male nurses.  The Governor hadto intervene to protect-the prospects of  nurses in service who  would  in future be promoted as Ward Sisters.  The scheme has met  with  a good dealof opposition; the orders have since been slightly  modified.     The Government of the North-West Frontier Province have recently made a proposal to deprive medical officers of the privilege of private prac-tice  without the special permission of Government.     The Madras Government have decided not to allow members of Provm-cial  Services to commute their pensions in future.   The Sind Re-organisa-tion  Committee, on the  other hand, have recommended that commutation of
pensions should be made easier and that certain conditions which used to-be required should be withdrawn.                  (b) Interference with the Administration.      39. Following the lead given by the  Congress Working  Committee^  resolution mentioned  in paragraph 43 of the last Survey, the  United Pro-  ymces Provincial Congress Committee issued a circular in December warn-  ing Congressmen to abstain from interference with police and  magistrates.      40. Rural Development Schemes. The United Provinces scheme, des-  cribed in para. 58 of Survey No. 4, appears to have made a beginning on  lines that permit official supervision and co-operation and have not proved  objectionable.                             ;;      41.  Local Self-Government Reform. The United Provinces Govern-  ment intend to concentrate on a scheme recommended by the Committee for  reorganisation and  expansion of village   panchayats.    A  Bill  is  being  drafted.   In the Central Provinces  Islow  progress has been  made  with  Misra&apos;s proposals (see para. 51  of Survey No. 2) :  a Bill of an  extravagant  and impracticable nature has been drafted :  it proposes to increase the num-  ber of village panchayats from  1,000 already existing to about  20,000, and  to form two types of panchayat,  one of which will be responsible for admini-.  strative duties and the other for civil and criminal judicial work.    The  association and control of Deputy Commissioners is to be abolished, and in  fact centralisation is  actually to be increased in  direct opposition to the  idea of local self-government.      42. District  Councils. The Premier of the   United Provinces has  recently revived  a proposal, which  has been considered in  various  forms  from time to time in the past, to appoint councils in every district to advise  District Officers over a large field in which the advice of non-officials might  in his opinion be  useful.    The Council would consist of the District Magis-  trate and Superintendent  of Police, with the President of the local  Bar  Association,  the  local  members  of the Legislative Assembly  and Council,  and  two or three  other members to be  nominated by the  Government.   The  scheme is at present in embryo: its effect on the status of district officers  might be  detrimental, and would certainly be so if  they were generally- expected to follow the  advice of  the Councils.     43.  The, Volunteer Movement. The  information  which   has   been collected about the progress of volunteer organisations in India leads to the conclusion that at present there  are large  gaps between professed aims  and achievement,  that the drive behind the various movements is fitful, and that their development is neither co-ordinated  nor rapid.   The Congress enter- prise lacks central control and unity of effort; this is rather less true of the Muslim  organisation.   The danger of the parallel growth of imperfectly disciplined volunteer corps of communal and nationalist origin is obvious. A feature  of the whole movement is the tendency towards training on mili- tary lines; almost all volunteers have a distinctive uniform and flag and carry lathis.  Another potentially dangerous feature is the training camp, which is liable  to become a seed-bed of subversive  doctrine or communal enmity. It appears that: generally speaking the volunteer movement has  made more progress in the United Provinces than  elsewhere.    The Congress volunteer movement has  aroused very little  interest in the Punjab, Bengal or Madras,  and.has hardly  passed beyond the  talking stage in most other Provinces.  In the United Provinces attempts are being made to form a Congress &quot;army&quot;, whose &quot;commander&quot; hopes to raise a lakhof volunteers by 1940, to be trained on police and military lines, and  intend-ed: eventually, to  replace  the police  force.   The organisers&apos;  attempts toextend the  influence of the  &quot;army&quot;  beyond  the  Province  have met  withnegligible success,  but a number of training camps have been started inside the Province.   Elsewhere schemes have been prepared,  camps  have  been
opened,  and; volunteer  organisations have * begun recruiting, but nowherehas the movement yet developed - strongly.    Response to Gandhi&apos;s  call for &quot;peace brigades&quot;&quot;  to  function  duringcommunal&apos; trouble has been slight.  Feeble attempts to organise brigades.were made in Bihar,  Bombay and Sind, but nothing is ever heard, of their activities.    The Muslim League sponsors two organisations,  viz,, volunteer  corpsand the- &quot;Muslim National  Guard&apos;V.   Again if  is the United Provinces.where  these movements have made most progress..  The volunteer corps issaid to have a membership of 11,000 in this Province, and 6,000 in the North-West Frontier-Province; the &quot;National Guard&quot; (which was mentioned inparagraph 46 of the  last Survey) is-3,000 strong in the United  Provinces.Small  &quot;guards&quot; also exists-in:Sind and in Calcutta.  The volunteers arerequired to, keep lathis and knives.    There are-a number of other purely communal volunteer organisations,e.g., the Ahrars in the Punjab and the United Provinces, who number 4,000odd, and a Hindu movement run under-the auspices of the Hindu Maha-sabha.  One&apos;revolutionary body exists  in the United Provinces; the Jaun-pore Youth. League, whose- activities; include  the preparation- and issue of revolutionary literature.  The present membership- of the  League is about1,150 and  is increasing.  The only other organisation, of1 which mentionneed at present be made is the&apos; labour volunteer corps known as the &quot;MazdurRed Army&quot; inGawnpore (United Provinces), which has a strength of about,000;  and which may become a danger to public order.    The training of volunteers on. military lines and in the use of  weapons usually lathis, but swords and spears also have made their appearance ismeaningless unless they- are expected some day to use force.  It has already-been hinted that the  Muslim National Guard will remain non-violent onlyso long as suits its purpose-.   Behind the movement is a volume of youthfulenergy which might prove useful to the country if means  could  be devised to divert it into other channels, such for instance as could be linked withthe defence forces.   Interest  therefore attaches to-the-proposals made to-extend military&apos;: train-jug, in the. Provinces.:  The Governments  of   Bihar,Bombay, the. Central and, United Provinces,, have all been considering thedevelopment of military training in. schools, and Universities.  The MadrasLegislative Assembly accepted, a resolution urging Government  to provide facilities for military training in- schools -and. outside.them;- but the Premier,while agreeing, with;the.principle- saidvthat it, was impossible to give-effectto the  resolution- for want of money.

    The Congress Ministries vary in their attitude.  The less resolute, ormore sentimental, of them are still averse from using some of the customarylegal weapons,  and are apt to prefer their own methods of restraining theunruly; but this aversion seems to be less pronounced than it was  (except where,  for instance in dealing with agitation  against  States, there areSpecial reasons  for hesitation); and the  use of section 144 of the criminal procedure Code is now common and  passes almost unnoticed.    46. The Government of Assam have released all the &quot;political&quot;  prison-ers in the Province (see para. 58).    47. In Bihar, industrial labour is continually restless; and communalfeeling, aggravated by the recent Patna  conference of the All-India  muslim league, may give rise to awkward problems in the near future.   The fieldin which the Ministry&apos;s capacity to  govern seems now to be seriously chal-lenged is that of  agrarian agitation, under the leadership  (but apparentlygoing beyond the control) of extremists with whom the Ministry  is still notprepared to deal firmly.    The Ministry proposed to repeal the Bihar Public Safety Act,  1933,which is in force till March, 1941.   This Act gives powers of internmentand externment,  to secure reports of public  meetings, and to deal withagitation to prevent the payment of rent or taxes.  The Orissa Governmenthas already repealed the Act in  its application to that Province; and  similar,or stronger, measures have been repealed or allowed  to lapse in Bombay andBengal.  As long as the present Ministry is in  power the Act is likely  tobe a dead letter; and although  its repeal will deprive Government of usefulpowers against labour and agrarian disturbances, it was considered impos-sible in the circumstances to  over-ride the Ministry.   The Premier  was in-tending to introduce legislation, on the lines of the Goondas Acts  existing in  some other Provinces, and  to embody  in this measure  provisions notunlike some appearing in the  Public Safety Act:  but this idea has been dropped.    48. The Bombay Ministry  have shown their customary firmness  in deal-ing with labour disturbances (see para. 76).,     The Ordinance drafted  by the  Home Minister  to replace in an emer-gency the repealed Bombay Special  (Emergency)  Powers Act (see para.  66of  Survey No. 4), does not give the Provincial Government power to controltraffic and transport, or to secure reports of public  meetings; it omits alsoall the powers given by the Act to deal with no-rent and similar campaigns;otherwise it is an almost exact replica of the repealed Act  and gives thesame powers of control over  suspected persons, externment and  so  forth.     The security taken from the newspaper &quot;Al-Hilal&quot; under  the IndianPress (Emergency Powers) Act was refunded in December under section 7  (2)of  the  Act.  In  November  the Legislative Assembly rejected a resolutionrecommending  the return of all securities forfeited  under the Act  between1929 and 1937..     49. The Madras Government have had nothing more serious  to cope with than the anti-Hindi agitation, which  showed signs of subsiding inNovember  but has since  revived.  By the  end  of   January  669   personshad  been  convicted.  The  movement has become   more   violently anti-Brahmin.   Picketing of schools in Madras has been more or less continuous;on January 24th, 45 arrests were made, the largest contingent up  to date.A  new feature has been participation in  picketing by women, a number of whom have been sent to jail.   In December, E. V. Ramaswanii  Naicker, an agitator  of some influence who was about to be elected leader of the Justice party,  was arrested for abetting picketing and sentenced to a year&apos;s imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 1,000.  Though his prosecution was initiat- ed without the knowledge of the Premier, he remains in jail.  His brother, Krishnaswami Naicker,  is the editor who was prosecuted in October  for sedition and exciting communal hatred (see paragraph 54 of the last, Survey) : he was acquitted of the  offence of  sedition but convicted of the offence of exciting communal  hatred and sentenced to six  months&apos;  imprisonment.

    This Ministry has decided to abandon the forcible feeding of hunger-strikers in jail,  and to issue orders for artificial feeding only when a pri-soner, as a result of his own obstinacy, is in a state where he is not respon-sible for his actions.    50. The policy of the Orissa Ministry towards  anti-State agitation is described  elsewhere (see para.  84).    51. In the United Provinces there was  a serious outbreak of indisci-pline among the students of the Aligarh University  on January the 26th &quot;Independence Day&quot;.  A number of students, apparently irritated by the behaviour of a policeman who is alleged to have struck one of them duringan altercation outside an exhibition,  attacked the  police camp,   beat   anumber of policemen and set the camp on fire; some 40 policemen were in-injured and some students also were hurt. The next  day several hundredstudents made a demonstration in front of the police station and also at thebungalow of the Superintendent of Police.   The authority of the police inAligarh was considerably shaken; police reinforcements were sent and quietwas^ restored.   The University  authorities,  instead of   expressing  theirregret and offering their assistance in restoring discipline, publicly identified-fied themselves with a version of the events  which appears to be quite in-accurate.    52. Reporting of speeches. Swami   Sahajanand,   the  kisan leader,visited the Central Provinces in January; his utterances were so objection-able that the Government have issued orders that  full reports shall be secur-ed of  his  speeches  if   he  returns.   The s United Provinces  Govern-ment instructed  District  Magistrates in November that all speeches deliver-ed at communal  and agrarian meetings  are to be reported  by the police,unless the  District Magistrate considers  it unnecessary.  These orders re-present  a slight  advance  on those mentioned in para. 58 of the last Survey.    53. Honorary Magistrates. The Central Provinces  Government  havedecided to abolish all the &quot;special magistrates&quot; appointed to take the placeof honorary magistrates (see para. 73 of Survey No. 4).  As a result allthe criminal work of the Province has now  to be done by the stipendiarystaff.    54.  Tear gas. A contingent from Bombay has received training in the punjab; only  contingents from Bengal, Bihar, Sind and  Delhi  are expect-ed to attend the next course  in April, 1939.    55. Remission of sentences. A case which occurred in the  united provinces has  been vigorously criticised.   One Makhan Singh was sentenced to transportation for life in January 1936, for the murder of two Muslims.The High Court upheld the verdict and sentence.   Under the p re-autonomyregime the Government considered a  representation of the District Magis-trate and  Commissioner that local opinion held the men to be guiltless : butrefused to interfere on  the ground that such opinion should not  prevailagainst the findings of the Courts.  The present Ministry were induced to reopen the case,  and after studying the material with care decided that the prisoner should  be released  on the ground that  facts had been  overlookedwhich rendered  his guilt doubtful.    Questions were  asked  in the Assembly,  and an  adjournment motion on the subject  was debated and defeated.   The Ministry, however fully con-vinced of the  innocence  of the man,  were the more certain to be attackedfor unwarrantable interference  with the course  of justice from the  com-munal  aspect  of the case.    The storm brewing  in Madras between the Government and  the HighCourt (see para.  61 of the last Survey) happily blew over.    In  Assam an instance of interference by the Government in  a criminalcase has been condemned in scathing terms by  the High Court.   Severalaccused were  under  trial for fabrication of evidence and forgery, one ofthem being a  Sub-Registrar whose prosecution was  sanctioned by&apos;the Gov-ernment.   In  August 1937  the  Government called  for the records of the
case and kept them for six months.  In March 1938 the Government Pleaderasked for. withdrawal of the case,, one of the grounds being&apos;that the Govern-ment considered, that, the evidence was insufficient to warrant further pro-ceedings although the prosecution evidence was by no means finished-  the magistrate allowed, the accused persons to be discharged, noting at the time that&quot; in his opinion there were sufficient grounds for holding  that serious.offences.had been committed.   Later it came out that one of the accused.wasclosely related to one of the Ministers (not now in office)  and  that two otheraccused also  were his relations.   The High Court returned the case to the magistrate for retrial, holding/that the  action of the  Government  was entirely illegal and based on worthless pretexts.    5.6,. Conferences.-^-The.  conference, of Home Ministers (referred to in.para, 62 of the last Survey) was arranged for the middle, of December, eightProvinces: having accepted the invitation.  Of those who refused, the Gov-ernraent of. Assam,said they could not afford to send their Minister; the HomeRjini.gter. oi thfi.U;^ite4..i?rpjviftc^,.was- busy with  an Assembly  session; andPajagdpalachari, of Madras, thought, that, the conference was premature.!Afc, tljs    &apos;^oment..the;.Ministers..Qf. Bihar,  the Central Provinces and Sindwere prevented from, attending, so  the conference had to, be  postponed.  Itis now proposed to hold it in May or June next,  in Simla.    In, accordance with a recommendation of, the Indian  J ails  Committee,conferences, of. Provincial Inspectors. General of Prisons have, been held-periodically.   In,, response, to the, Central Governments  invitation to. theconference to bp, held in, January,  1939, the. Governments of Bihar and theCentral Provinces indicated, that they, were, opposed to; the nature and prin-ciple of such. a; conference, however useful a purpose it  may have served inthe past.   The. Bombay, Government, also  refused to send their  InspectorGeneral, and Sind. were, unable to do so.,  The Inspectors-General of theother seven Provinces assembled in Delhi, at the end of January; the agendaincluded subjects such ,as the. classification, of prisoners  with special refer-ence to the treatment of &quot;political prisoners&quot;; treatment of hunger-strikers;remissions, premature releases, and the like.                 (e)  &quot;Political&quot; prisoners and detenus.    57. &quot;With- the  release of. all the. &quot;political&quot; prisoners, in Assam by thenew. Congress coalition Government, this  problem should now be confined to Bengal and the Punjab, unless other Ministries  discover in their jailsprisoners; hitherto, not. defined, as &apos; &quot;political&apos;\    58;-In A ssam there were ten terrorist convicts : one was released tempo-temporarily early in 1938 on-grounds of health, and later freed unconditionally.On December 5th,  a resolution was accepted in the  Assembly to the effectthat,alt &quot;political&quot; prisoners should be released forthwith; and on December14th the remaining, nine,were set free.  Among these nine were two who had served only 5 years of a. life sentence..  It was regarded as certain that the.Ministry would resign- if the proposal, were  rejected,   The Governor was unable  to plead grave menace to the peace and tranquillity of  the Provinceas ground for rejecting it; and though the possibility of  embarrassmentbeing caused to the neighbouring Government of Bengal  was  appreciated,it was. hoped that this would be mitigated by the terms of. the announcementwhiph. made, it clear that, the Assam Government had examined each, caseindividually  and were satisfied: with  the assurances obtained from the pri-soners that they had. abjured: terrorism.    59. The Bengal  Congress Committee decided  early in November to start a campaign for the release of the 242 terrorist convicts still in jail.  OnNovember 11th,  226. prisoners went on a three-day hunger-strike, apparent-ly ip concert with  the,agitation.  On the 12th,/Subhas Bose launched thenew campaign,; it has created no excitement and has received little response.Bose  announced that,  Congress do not, propose to precipitate  an all-Indiacrisis over this question, although, the demand for releases has the supportof the Working Committee.
    In the middle of December the Bengal Government announced the per-sonnel of the Advisory Committee appointed in accordance with the policypreviously  announced (see para. 75 of Survey No. 4).   The President is are tired High Court Judge; the leader of the Congress  opposition,  SaratBose, has agreed to sit on the Committee, which includes six other membersof the Legislature and an official of the Bengal Government.  Gandhi isbelieved.to take the view that no drastic action should be taken by Congressuntil this Committee submits a report: but it may be presumed that he hasnot forgotten his undertaking to secure the release of the prisoners by April,13.     Towards the end  of January the committee submitted its first recom-mendations.  Of 83 cases examined consideration of 36 has been postponed until the prisoners are interviewed; the committee recommended that theother 47 should be released unconditionally.   Of these, 43 have half or less of  their sentences to  serve. The  Governor has agreed  with his Govern-menfs proposal to release the convicts in small groups early in February.     A census of released detenus has recently been taken in the districts ofNoakhali,  Jalpaiguri  and  Tipperah.  In the first, out of 112  ea;-detenusonly 34 have settled down to jobs : 15 who have employment are still engaging in their  old activities, and  63 are unemployed, of whom 31 are taking partin the activities of revolutionary  organisations.  In  the last two districts,the census shows that about a half or more of the e^-detenus are still engagedin their old subversive activities.  Released  detenus have also been agita-ting among the cultivating  classes and students, under the guise of politicalpropagandists.,     60.  There are 28 terrorist convicts  in  the Punjab.  One Sham Lai, amember of the Central Assembly, in a letter to Gandhi expressed his regret that the prisoners would not  give an assurance of belief in non-violenceeven to  Gandhi  himself.   Eight have recently  been  prematurely released,most  of  them   on  grounds of health.  All have   served  the   greaterpart of their sentences.  From one of them an undertaking, has been obtain- ed not to  enter the Punjab without written permission.     61. In the Delhi Province there are three persons detained on account of revolutionary activities under Regulation III of 1818, by order of the Central Government.   After consulting the Governments of the Provinces in which they had been active,  the Central Government decided to offer them their freedom on their giving certain undertakings.  For instance, the Con- gress Government of Bombay  asked that one of  the prisoners should under- take to  remain outside Bombay Province.  They were also required to give an  assurance that they would  refrain from violence.   The prisoners reject- ed  this  offer in contemptuous  language  last November: they have therefore been kept in jail.  A Congress member of the  Central Assembly tried but failed to persuade them to change their minds and give the required under- takings; he was however much impressed by the comforts which the prisoners enjoy and which may in some degree explain their refusal to leave the prison.                       (f) The Agrarian situation.    62. Agrarian discontent has been widespread, and agitation has beenreported from nearly all Provinces.,    It was reported in January that in one district in Assam tenants werewithholding rents on the advice of  agitators.   In Bengal   -detenus havebeen instrumental in creating discontent and spreading Communist doctrinesamong the peasant classes.  There appears to be a general feeling that rentsare bound to be reduced soon,  so that there is good reason for postponingpayment.  One Commissioner reported that collection of rent is likely to be seriously affected by the provision in the Bengal Tenancy (Amendment) Actwhich abolishes the system of summary procedure for  recovery of rents.    405(S) SecytoGGPublic
Tenants are expecting a lowering of rent-rates as a result of the enquiriesby the Land Revenue Commission,  the personnel of which was announced on November 5th.   The Chairman is Sir Francis Floud, and the personnelincludes three members of the Legislative Assembly, a retired High court judge,  and a member of the I. C. S.  The Commission has prepared an elaborate questionnaire and is prosecuting its enquiries.    In  Bihar the agrarian situation has continued to be unsettled.  SwamiSahajanand has kept  up his&apos; virulent  propaganda  against  landlords and congress; he has lately been preaching a modified no-rent campaign thatkisans should refuse to pay  any part of their produce to zamindars unlessthe latter behave themselves; and that then they should pay only what theycan afford after satisfying their own needs.  The Provincial Kisan congress in December attracted large  crowds: an important resolution stated that inorder to fight for their rights kisans had &apos; &apos;no other means but to offer satya-graha with full strength, in an organised way, remaining peaceful under allconditions&quot;.  Another resolution attacked Congress for drifting away fromkisan sabhas towards constitutionalism.  In the Gaya district, in November,kisans defied magistrates&apos; orders; the Ministry gave the District Magistratea free hand to deal with leading agitators under the security sections of the criminal Procedure Code, but were opposed to the use of  prohibitory orders.In December so-called satyagraha commenced in the same district: crops ondisputed lands were cut, and the police had to harvest crops on one occasion.Four volunteers were arrested for criminal offences.  In  January the situa-tion deteriorated.   A lightning strike broke out in the Gaya Cotton andJute Mills and was immediately taken up  by  the  Socialist-cwm-Kisangroup; the strike was marked by a number of attacks on the police who were on duty near the mill and culminated in a riot on January 4th, when, imme-diately  after Swami Sahajanand had addressed a mass meeting.of strikers,,a mob of 300 attacked the police of whom about 20 received injuries.   Thir-teen leaders were arrested during the strike and received sentences varying from  six months to a year.  Organised  crop-cutting and  ploughing con-tinued in the district and volunteers came from other districts in the Pro-vince to assist; a resolution  of  the Provincial Congress  Committee that nodistrict Committee  may start satyagraha without its sanction has given thekisan leaders a check; their local President threatened  to resign from theCongress unless the resolution  was  withdrawn.   There were indications that, the situation was getting beyond the control of the  kisan leaders; at a demonstration organised by Sahajanand at Gaya on January 16th, a crowdwhen wishing to return home rushed the railway station barrier and occu-pied the train; a similar scene  occurred at a neighbouring station.   Satya-graha has also been started in other areas and threatened in two other dis-tricts.   In Monghyr a volunteer camp  organised crop looting at night overa large area and a force of 100  mounted and armed police had to be deputedthere.    There has been instigation  to the non-payment of rent in the Surat dis-trict of  Bombay, where a volunteer corps of kisans was being organised.Sahajanand visited Gujarat in December,  freely criticised the policy of non-violence and advised  peasants  to meet zamindars&apos; violence  vgith lathis in self-defence.   His preaching seems to have had less effect  in^this Provincethan elsewhere.    The Ministry decided to create a portfolio of rural reconstruction- underthe charge of the  Finance  Minister,  to whom most  agricultural subjectswould be transferred from the portfolio of the Revenue Minister.    In  the Central Provinces  the agitation has been comparatively  mild;but it took a serious turn in  Berar in January, where the worst feature was an apparently effective boycott of land  sales.   Sahajanand visited this Pro-vince also in January and made objectionable speeches; the Government haveordered full reports to be taken of  his  speeches if he returns.    A&apos;  no-rent campaign in the Malabar and South Kanara districts ofMadras, fostered by  Socialists,,  achieved,  some success,,  and intemperate
speeches were common.  In January the situation was reported to beimprov-ing after the Revenue Minister and local Congressmen denounced the agita-tion.    The publication of the report of the Estates Land Act Committee (see para. 67), has aroused exorbitant hopes in.the tenants of Zamindaris, andrents are being collected with great difficulty.    There has been no recrudescence, of the Galladher agitation   in  theNorth-West Frontier Province, mentioned in  para. 64 of the last  Survey.Before the Assembly session began in November the Premier released 159  ofthe agitators who had been sentenced to imprisonment.    In  Orissa, kisan  leaders were reported  in December to  be  advisingtenants to pay only half the rent  due to landowners.    Congressmen and Socialists stirred up unrest in the  Multan district  ofthe Punjab; speeches were anti-British and glorified terrorism.  The situa-tion improved when the  Cotton-Growers&apos;  Association conceded many  oftheir tenants&apos;  demands.  In the Hoshiarpur district there has for some time been friction between tenants and landlords; 16 tenants were recently acquit-ted on a charge of assaulting a  commissioner appointed to  arbitrate  in a dispute, with  the result that tenants  in  the area declared their determina-tion not to pay any of their dues to their landlords.     There have been few reports  from; the  United Provinces of any danger-ous agitation; the Tenancy Bill was still under discussion in the assembly at the end of January.  The Premier  agreed to the use of the  security sec-tions of the Criminal Procedure Code to  deal with agrarian  agitation  inLalitpur district..    63. Land Revenue. The Bombay Government have decided  to grantrevenue rebates,  in view of the fall in prices, of fourteen lakhs of rupees asagainst a previous average of eight lakhs.  The position in the Central Pro-vinces appears to be serious; the cotton crop  in Berar and in the Nagpurdivision has been a comparative failure., and a vigorous  agitation  began inwhich  impossible  demands  were given  currency an agitation partly in-tended  to embarrass the Mahakoshal  Ministers.   The latest report statesthat proposed suspensions of revenue  amount to  more than  eight lakhs  ofrupees in Berar and six lakhs in the C. P.  In Madras a cyclone in one area and failure of the monsoon elsewhere will necessitate remissions amountingto about half  a crore of rupees.   In the Punjab,  various forms of faminerelief have cost about 56^ lakhs in the current financial year and are esti-mated  to cost 75^ lakhs more in the next year.   Drastic  economy will  benecessary to remedy the financial situation which would otherwise have been satisfactory.   In Sind a disastrous frost in November caused much damage to the cotton crop and large remissions of revenue will be necessary.  In theUnited  Provinces land revenue collections have begun; they are progressingsatisfactorily and are said to be somewhat better than last year.    64. Agrarian Legislation. Details  of all legislation,  agrarian  and otherwise, passed into law between April, 1937, and the end of 1938, willbe found in Appendix III.   It will be seen that  agrarian  enactments  have formed  a large part of the output of nearly all the. Provincial Legislatures.Measures of wide scope, or involving important principles, have been passed in.Bengal, Bihar,  Madras, Orissa, the Punjab, and the  United Provinces,the effect of which is to benefit agriculturists at the expense of landlords  ormoneylenders,  or both.  (See also paras.  65 71 of the last Survey    65. Bombay.-The Tenancy Bill was formally introduced in the Legis-lative Assembly during November but discussion was postponed  till the next session.    66. Central Provinces. The  Revision of Land Revenue of Estates Billreceived the assent of the  Governor-General in December.
    67. Madras. In 1938  a Committee of the Legislature was appointed,with Prakasam, the Revenue Minister, as Chairman, to enquire into rela-tions between Zamindars and tenants in permanently settled estates and tomake recommendations for legislation.  Its report  was signed on Novem-ber 7th; the Committee was divided in its opinions, and  the  main recom-mendations were carried by a majority of 5 to 4, Prakasam being among themajority.  The majority report proceeds on the assumptions that  the ryotand not the Zamindar is the owner of the soil, and that (in spite of variouslegal decisions to the contrary) the intention of the Permanent Settlement of1802 was to fix rents (as well.as the sums &quot;peshkash&quot; payable by theZamindars to Government)  for all time. Whatever the merit of these assump-tions, and however  unfavourable the conditions of Zamindari tenants may now be as compared with those of ryots holding under  Government, the re-commendations of the Committee, particularly the main proposal to restore the level of rents prevailing in 1802, would be devastating  in effect; and theimmediate result of the publication of the report is the withholding  of rents,whether high or low, by the tenants.   The Premier in private professed tobe much alarmed by the recommendations; and most of the Ministers are believed to be  against the more drastic of  them.   But the  result of the debate in the Assembly which began on January 20th, and lasted seven daysis reported to be acceptance of the Congress party  motion recommending that immediate steps should be  taken to introduce legislation based on the Com-mittee&apos;s proposals.,     In October the Madras Government requested the Central Governmentto introduce legislation to  remove doubts and difficulties that  had  arisen inthe enforcement of  the Agriculturists&apos; Relief Act, 1938.  Courts had givenconflicting interpretations as to whether debts of a certain kind could validlybe reduced under the Act. The proposal was not  one which the CentralGovernment  could  accept.   Either the disputed matter is valid  as  beingwithin the powers of the Provincial Legislature,  in which case intervention by the Central Legislature  is unnecessary : or it is invalid, in which case theCentre could reasonably require a  ruling of the highest Court before con-sidering whether by introducing legislation it should endorse methods ofdealing with debt which have aroused a good deal of controversy in the Pro-yince.   The Central Government declined to comply with the request.     68. North-West Frontier Province The Agricultural Debtors&apos; Relief Bill was passed during November, but has not yet received the Governors assent.  Its provisions appear to be more  sweeping than those of similar legislation passed in other Provinces.  The Muslim League party supported the Bill. It is  heartily disliked by all Hindus in the Province and is one of the main causes of  dissension  in  the Congress  ranks.  The &quot;Teri Dues&quot; Bill, mentioned in paragraph 92 of  Survey  No.  4 was passed in  November in the form recommended  by  the Governor, and  received his  assent in Dec- ember.     69 Orissa  No progress has been  made   with  compromise over the&quot;Madras Estates Land  (Orissa Amendment)  Bill.  A conference was  to have  been held with landowners in  November, with Rajendra Prasad pre- sent as the Ministry&apos;s expert  adviser : but Rajendra Prasad&apos;s illness has prevented him from taking part so far.   It  is now expected that discussions  will begin early in February.      70 Punjab -Three more Bills to benefit  agriculturists  have been  passed  The provisions of the Alienation of Land (Fourth Amendment) Act  and of the Punjab Debtors&apos;  Protection (Amendment) Act will be found m  Appendix TIL  The  Agricultural Produce  Markets Bill  was  passed  in  January -  it  is intended  to secure a higher percentage of the sale price of  agricultural produce for  the producer, by regulating the numerous charges  levied from him.   The Alienation of Land (Second Amendment) Bill, deal-  ing with benami transactions, which was reserved for the consideration of  the Governor-General, is still under discussion  with  the Secretary of State.
    71. United Provinces. Towards the end of the year two Acts  were passed, the terms of which appear in Appendix III.  They are the Tempo-rary Postponement of Execution of Decrees Act and the Rent and RevenueRelief Act.   The Tenancy Bill was introduced in the Assembly on Novem-ber 10th; it has been under discussion ever since and is expected to be passedabout the end of February.  The Congress Working Committee declined to intervene to secure a compromise, the talukdars of Oudh having refused topledge themselves to  accept the Committee&apos;s decisions as final.  The inten-tion of the Ministry appears to be to carry through  the Bill essentially inthe form recommended by the Select Committee.  Even so,  it is by no means certain that the left wing will be content,  and that  section of Congress ispowerful enough in  the Province to cause  the Government a good deal of:inconvenience.  The principles for the fixation of rent have gone  throughpractically unchanged, and these appear to give much less scope for reductionof rent than the left wing demands.                           (g) Communism.    72. Communist plans have continued to concentrate on left-wing unity.At the beginning of  November, Communists, Socialists and other left-wingelements, decided to act as a united bloc with a common programme.   A newworking formula was evolved, which has been published and distributed asa &quot;Call to Congressmen&quot;.  This manifesto  appeals to  Congressmen to up-hold the revolutionary principles of t-he^Congress,  criticises Congress Minis-tries  for repressive measures, and demands uncompromising opposition to federation,  active support for the States&apos;  people&apos;s agitation,  and  enlarge-ment of civil liberties.     Subhas  Bose&apos;s re-election as President  of the Congress, in a straightfight  with a moderate who was admittedly the right-wing nominee,  must give great encouragement to  the extremist sections which look to  him forleadership:  and it may be expected that the left wing  will not be so easilythwarted at  the Tripuri  session in  March  as they were  at Haripura andDelhi.     The Bombay strike of  November 7th  is described below.  This was organised with the full force and energy of  the Communist party, in opposi-tion to the Congress Ministry and to establish a hold on labour in  competi-tion with the claims of  Congress.  Cawnpore is still a hotbed of Commun-ism;  elsewhere  in  the United Provinces at Lucknow,   Allahabad,  andBenares the Communist aim is against the electricity  and other  publicutility services:  a  strike at  Lucknow  on  &quot;Independence Day&quot;  (January26th) was averted, but may only have been postponed.                       (h)  The Labour situation.     73. Assam. The situation in Digboi has been quiet; the parties wereawaiting the report  of the court of enquiry; this came out in January andits finding was that conditions of labour in the Assam Oil Company are not unsatisfactory.  At Dibrugarh, a number  of contractors&apos; labourers had tobe discharged, with  a month&apos;s notice, when the site for stacking coal onwhich they  were employed was washed  away by river erosion : a campaignwas started  to boycott the Dibru-Sadiya railway : the station and railwaybuses were  picketed.  The Premier intervened in the  dispute; the boycottwas called off on December 22nd, and a settlement reached.     74.  Bengal. As a protest against  the refusal  by the management ofa jute mill in  Titagarh to reinstate six workers who  had been dischargedfor carrying on propaganda  against the Jute Ordinance, (as to which seeparagraph 31 of the last Survey), more than 20,000 workers in the jute millsin that area went on strike on November 14th.  By the  end  of November,the number  rose to 43,000  and 10  mills were  affected.  The strike early     405(S) SeoytoGGPublic
assumed a communal character; on November 17th three persons were killed and forty injured in rioting.  Many arrests were made, a  curfew order,was issued,  and police  and troops patrolled the area.  Another clash  onDecember 5th resulted  in  twenty-five  more injuries.  Attempts made  tocall a general strike failed, and the strike collapsed early in January whenthe mills reopened with a nearly full complement.   The managements have since  been accused of victimization, more particularly of labour recruited from Madras.   Though labour  unrest in Bengal  may at times be instigatedand financed by rival business  interests or be prompted by non-industrial,for instance communal, motives, as soon as trouble breaks out leaders of the professional revolutionary type  step in to enhance their own importance andthe danger of the spread of Communist propaganda and of control by Com-munist leaders is always present.    A hopeful sign is that all  the members of the Indian Jute Associationhave  recently executed  a working agreement,  to come into operation  by march, and  to last for a period of five  years, to  regulate production.  Thiswas the  purpose of  the  Bengal Jute Ordinance; the Association hopes tosuggest very shortly a. date for  the withdrawal of the Ordinance.    On January 4th workers in the Bata  Shoe Factory at Batanagar wenton strike,, instigated by agitators amongst whom was a notorious Commun-ist.  Qn the 9th the police  had to open fire on. an unruly mob during a dis-turbance between, strikers and  loyal workers.  Two men were injured :  noone was. killed.   The .dispute  was settled. by   January 19th.   A strikewhich,began in  October at the Indian Standard Wagon Company&apos;s works at. Asansol was  continuing at. the end  of  January : on November 17th oneof the European staff was attacked and escaped with difficulty.  Anotherstrike, at the Bengal Paper Mills,  Raniganj,  which began on  November13th,  had not been settled at the end of January.    75. Bihar.-There  has been a. general improvement.    The disputes atthe Tatanagar Foundry and the Copper Works have been settled by arbitra-tion.   The strike in the coal-fields  spread no  further; though  stalemateexisted for sometime, a settlement was reached at the end of December.   the cable company  agreed  to the appointment of a. conciliation board, and inthe meantime the parties engaged in private negotiation; a settlement wasreached on December 31st and all the strikers  resumed work a few days later. *    76., Bombay.-On November 4th, the Trades Disputes Bill was passedby the Legislative.Assembly (see paragraph 12of the last Survey).   Opposi-tion to the Bill  found vent in. a call for a&apos;general strike in Bombay city onNovember 7th.   The idea was started by Communist agitators who  foresaw-that their chances to organise lightning strikes would be seriously curtailed;but they were joined by other parties who were determined to  use the oppor-tunity for  an   anti-Congress  demonstration.   The   &quot;Harijan&quot;  leader,Ambedkar, and  his Independent Labour party,,  and Jamnadas Mehta withthe Bombay T.  U.  C, accepted the Communist  scheme for their own pur-poses, and called  for volunteers.  The Home Minister warned the public that,,  while a peaceful, demonstration would be tolerated, Government were bound to afford,  adequate protection to  those who did not join in the strike.On November 7th, in.Bombay city 60 out of the 77 mills and factories open-ed and about half the  workers attended : in Ahmedabad,  Sholapur,  andother industrial centres, there  was even less response to the  call to strike.In.Bombay city there were serious disturbances  which compelled the police to open fire; 11 people were injured by the firing of whom 2 died.   VallabhaiPatel and Munshi, Home Minister, had stones thrown at their car.  traffic was dislocated by crowds of demonstrators.-  About 75 persons in all wereinjured,  including 11 policemen.   Order was restored and.on the next dayall was quiet,    Vallabhai   Patel at once  issued a statement stressing the  miserable.failure of the strike as a whole, and later spoke in justification of the firing.The Bombay Government  appointed a Committee  to enquire into all  the.
                                  2Sevents of  the strike, under the chairmanship of. a High Court Judge:  the bombay T. TJ. C. decided to boycott the enquiry, because the terms of refer-ence were unacceptable and PaiePs statement had prejudiced the Commit-tee&apos;s  impartiality.   Under MunshPs  personal direction the. Governmentdrew up an elaborate note for the Committee, attributing the strike to themachinations of Communists,  tracing the history of Communist activity inIndia and justifying the measures taken to suppress disturbance.   the bombay  Provincial  Congress  Committee has taken disciplinary measures against, a number of.persons who took part in the strike.    Tne Government can claim to have handled the situation with firmnessand success: and to have once more  shown  their capacity  for pursuing a-definite policy without yielding to clamour and for dealing  effectively witha challenge to public order.    The long drawn out strike at the Gokak mills  came to an end on Novem-ber 15th. when workers returned to work unconditionally.   A-number ofmischief-makers among  them succeeded in creating a fresh disturbance onDecember 23rd; several injuries were caused in rioting;  a number of arrestswere  made, a prohibitory order was issued, and 13 persons were served withexternment orders under the Police Act.    More than 100  violent picketers were arrested. and prosecuted underthe Police Act during disturbances at the  Saraswati Printing Works in;November.    77. Madras.-A. fresh dispute broke out at:the Chittivalsa jute mills&apos;in November,  when  a woman worker was dismissed for insubordination,and the management closed the mill in expectation of a stay-in strike.   Thedispute was settled  on December 12th.  At Madura, a member of the Pror-vincial Assembly brought about a strike in the Mahalakshmi mills in October;he formed a union of mill-workers among whose demands was the reinstate-ment of 14 dismissed workers; the Commissioner of Labour found the demand;unjustified, whereupon the men struck; the mill was kept working.  Eightypicketers  were prosecuted, strikers had to be dispersed by  a lathi  charge,and the member of  the Assembly was  arrested and sentenced to a term of imprisonment.  The strike ended on November 7th, the management havingagreed to  certain concessions.-    78. United Provinces.-There have  been one or two minor strikes in-&apos;Cawnpore, where labour conditions are far from settled.  Communists areactive, revolution is preached,&quot; unruly  meetings are held at the mill gates;and labour is being  kept  in a state of unrest by artificial agitation.   Theemployers are critical of the Governments inactivity and believe that !the 1demonstrations could be suppressed with little difficulty.  While the Mini-stry have.issued, a circular .to District Magistratesipermitting them to de-&apos;mand security from  persons who publicly advocate violence,, the danger re-.mains of an irresolute policy in. the face i of.  the growing strength of; forces-.of discontent.   During January there was some uneasiness about the possi-bility of. strikes in the.Electric Supply Works both at Lucknow. and  Allaha-:bad,, but the efforts  of the Labour  Commissioner were successful in getting:at any rate a postponement of the trouble, and the chances;  of a settlementare.fair.    79. Trades  Unions. No mention has been  made in previous Surveys;of Trades Unions in.India; in fact there  is little to be said.   The AlhIndiaTrade Union  Congress  was founded in  1920; in 1926 the Trade  Unions&apos;Act was passed, conferring on registered  unions immunity from prosecutionfor criminal conspiracy  and from civil  suits for breach of contract,   andsubjecting their accounts to an annual audit.  In 1929 the moderate  ele-ments broke away from the extremists and formed  an All-India Trade UnionFederation, and this in 1933 was amalgamated with the National Federationof Labour under the title of National Trades Union Federation.  In April1938, this body rejoined the All-India Trade Union Congress; which is nota registered association.  The Trade. Union organisation appears  to  have.:
little support or influence, and its importance is negligible in actual disputes between employers and employed.    The President is one Suresh  Bannerji,  who has  stated that the finalobject of the organisation is the establishment in India of a Socialist State,and its present policy co-operation with  the Indian National Congress.                             (i) Terrorism.    80. There  is little that is.definite to say  under this head.  Thoughmany persons who had been in confinement for terrorist  crime are now at large, their activities,  where of political interest, appear  to be for the mostpart uncoordinated.  The desire-among persons with  terrorist inclinationsto make the next political  mass movement a violent  one is  common,  andthis as a rule leads to their  siipport of the &apos;united front&apos;  movement and theCommunist programme.  Among ex-detenus in Bengal,  the   Anushilangroup  favours  the capture  of  the Congress  Socialist  party, and is closely associated  with the leading ex-Kakori convicts  in the United  Provinces;the Jugantar group prefers to base its organisation on  the Congress.  Inthe United Provinces  the main effort  is  directed to infiltration  into youthleagues.    Terrorist organisation  in Bihar  and. the Punjab has not  progressedbeyond the efforts to re-establish connection with other revolutionaries.    As has been mentioned in paragraph 59 above, a recent census of ex-detenus in certain  districts  in Bengal reveals  that about half of them arestill engaged in their old subversive activities.    Another serious railway accident, has been attributed to sabotage, but cannot  be  traced to the work of terrorists.  There have been  two recentinstances of terrorists taking  part in crime a profitable burglary  in ajeweller&apos;s  shop in the Punjab, and a  succession of dacoities  in  the united provinces : the motive was  apparently not political but their  own benefit.                         (j)  Communal  troubles.    81. During the quarter, there have been no serious disturbances,  andthe great Muslim festival of Id-ul-Fitr on November 24th passed off peace-f ully :  but it would be quite incorrect to  make the deduction that communalrelations are improving.   It is scarcely possible for them to improve so longas the blatant propaganda of the Muslim League and the Hindu organisa-tions continues.    The Assam Government have issued orders similar to  those prevailing in Bengal, that music shall  be prohibited before mosques  at certain fixedhours of prayer.   In Bengal, tension arose when Hindus of Burdwan tookout an unlicensed procession, and the Ministry desired to  express the dis-pleasure of Government by the refusal of a licence so long as they remaineddefiant : negotiations were opened through a resident of Burdwan on whosepersuasion the defiant attitude was dropped and a peaceful settlement wasreached.  Stray assaults  and rioting followed a Hindu-Muslim dispute  atAsansol oti January 19th; one Hindu was killed and 18 persons were injured.A prohibitory order was  issued for two  months.    The excitement created by the session of the Muslim League at Patnahas led to more embittered relations in Bihar.  On January 26th communalrioting at Gaya in connection with a flag-hoisting ceremony in honour  of&quot;Independence Day&quot; led to about 50 persons being injured.  A prohibitoryorder under section 144 was promulgated.  The  Committee enquiring intothe Bannu raid in  the North-West Frontier Province (see paragraph 84  ofthe last Survey) has  been recording evidence, but  has not yet  produced  areport.  Asaf Ali concluded his  enquiry on November 8th : his conclusionshave not been published.   Communal  tension was acute at Multan in the punjab during November; on the 15th a Muslim procession was  banned and
 the crowd had to be dispersed by a lathi charge; a prohibitory order was promulgated.  There have been no developments in the Shahidganj dispute.     The  Madhe-Sahaba controversy  at Lucknow,  United  Provinces, has been quiescent, but is not settled.  The Government announced in December that the District Magistrate would decide any application for permission to recite the offending verses, keeping in view the conditions prevailing at the time, and that he would be responsible for  the consequences of his action.     In  the Delhi &quot;temple dispute&quot;,  civil disobedience was kept up through- out the quarter and was continuing  at  the end  of January.  Prohibitory orders have been extended from time to time.  Some excitement was caused by a hunger-striker who announced  his intention of  fasting to death in support of  the  claims of the Hindus; when  he  was proposing to lead a procession through the city, lying on a stretcher, the authorities, in expecta- tion of  a- disturbance, arrested him; he provided the security demanded and left Delhi.  The sadhu who is the source of all the trouble has been released by the  High Court, which  while  upholding  his conviction  reduced the sentence to  the period already served.  He  has been served with an order prohibiting him  from  entering municipal limits.  On  January 28th judg- ment was delivered in the civil suit lodged by Government against the sadhu.  Decreeing the suit for Government with costs, the judge found that Government was the owner of the disputed site.     Ou January 22nd a Hindu celebration of &quot;Hyderabad Day&quot;, to protest against  alleged  oppression of Hindus in that State,  caused  offence  to Muslims in Delhi; 70 persons were injured in the ensuing riot.  On the same occasion a riot broke out in  Bareilly (United Provinces) where 4 persons were killed  and 69 injured; there was grave tension in  Lucknow also.          VI.-POLITICAL   MOVEMENTS.                        (a) The  Congress Party.     82.  Congress and  Federation. No further pronouncements on Federa- tion have  emanated from the &quot;Working Committee.  But  in view of Subhas Bose&apos;s very  recent re-election as President, in circumstances which suggest that his opinions will in future carry more weight than hitherto, it is worthwhile to recall some of his utterances.  In  November he was reported as stating  that the time had come for Congress  to abandon its defensive policy and to give the British Government an ultimatum, backed by the threat of civil disobedience, demanding   complete freedom  within  six months: Britain&apos;s  weakness as  a world power offered an opportunity which should be seized  to secure India&apos;s emancipation. A few days later he demanded that the &quot;drift towards constitutionalism&quot; should cease,  and that the war against  Federation should be waged from all sides: he repeated  the threat of satyagraha, and,  in reply to a question  as to whether or not congress ministries should resign  if civil  disobedience began, said that this was a matter of  expediency which would be  decided when the time came.     In December, referring to a speech made by the Viceroy at Calcutta, he declared that it contained nothing which would warrant a  change of attitude towards Federation; swaraj within a year is  possible if  full advantage istaken of the present opportunity: the Congress is opposed, not to the ideaof Federation, but to the Federal  scheme of the Constitution Act: the Gov- ernment need not delude themselves with the belief that  because office was accepted that scheme also would be accepted.     Subhas Bose claimed to be fighting the election for the office of Presidentof the Congress on the issue of Federation, in opposition to the secret inten-tion of the right-wing leaders to accept it:  and  his victory, whatever its results may prove to be, must for the present  be regarded as an endorsement of hostility  to the Federal scheme stated in more uncompromising  termsthan the other leaders of Congress opinion have cared to use.    405(S) SecytoGGPublio
    83. Congress and the States. Since paragraphs 90 and 91 of the lastSurvey were written, interference by Congress in the affairs of the states has grown to the  size of a first-class issue.  The  unacknowledged,  butpalpable,  motive is the securing of a majority in the Federal  Legislature.Of the ,250 British Indian seats in the future Assembly,  Congress cannothope to secure more than half.  To obtain  a majority in the whole Housethey must secure the allegiance either of Muslims or of States&apos; representa-tives.   The wooing of Muslims having proved a failure, the only possibleline of advance is through the representation of the States :  and that is openonly if election is accepted as the method of appointing the States&apos; represen-tatives, or some portion of them.  An obvious method of forcing Rulers toagree to this method  is to foment, such unrest  in  the States as will induce them to make terms with the power which can pacify  the storm it has raised.    It is  beyond the scope of this Survey to describe in detail  the prosecu-tion of this design.  The main points of recent attack have been Rajkot inthe west,  Jaipur in Rajputana, Nandgaon and  the Orissa States in  theeast.    On December 3rd, Gandhi, writing in the  &quot;Harijan&quot;, made a pro-pronouncement of the greatest importance.   He  acclaimed the simultaneousawakening in various States, and declared  that there is no halfway housebetween the total extinction of the States and full responsible government.Professing to have heard a rumour that the British Government would  go back on the statement of Lord Winterton in Parliament about the ability ofthe Princes to grant responsible government to their people, he announcedthat any  such recantation would  &quot;precipitate  a  first-class  crisis whosemagnitude it  is difficult to foretell.&quot;  Alluding to stories of excesses com-mitted  by the police of States  in  suppressing  agitation,  he claimed  thatMinistries in  the Provinces had the moral right and duty  to take  notice of gross misrule in the States, and to advise  the Paramount Power on what should be done.  In a phrase which was remembered, in a sense he did not intend, when a month later Major Bazalgette was murdered, he claimed that ministers  in  the  Provinces have  a  moral responsibility  regarding what happens in the States.  He then gave warning  that  the  Congress policyof non-interference might be abandoned : in terms  which can only mean thatthe policy was adopted for lack of power rather than of will, he announcedthat the Congress would be bound to intervene if its growing influence gaveit the strength to do so with effect: and he advised the Princes to &apos; Cultivatefriendly relations with an organisation which bids  fair in the future, notvery distant,  to replace  the Paramount  Power-let me hope, by friendlyarrangement.&quot;     The  Working Commdttee&apos;s resolution published  on  December 14th,repeated the familiar condemnation of repression in the States : and assertedthe right of Congress to protect the people against the unwarranted use ofmilitary or police forces lent by  the British Government to  combat the legitimate demand for responsible government.   Though considerations ofprudence prevented Congress at present from intervening directly and as an organisation  in the conflict, the right is reserved to guide and assist thepeople of the States, and the Congress must be increasingly identified withthem.   But the advice was repeated that persons not belonging to the states should not intervene :, and the necessity of non-violence was enjoined.  Thefull text is in Appendix I.     The policy of the Paramount Power was comprehensively defined in the reply given to a question in the House of Commons on December 16th ; therewill be no obstruction to proposals for constitutional advance initiated byRulers, but His Majesty&apos;s Government will bring  no pressure on them to initiate such changes: it is for the Rulers themselves  to decide what  formof government they should adopt  in the diverse  conditions of the States:the obligations of the Paramount Power extend to protecting the Rulers against violence and  disorder,  and  to  advising  and  assisting them in remedying such legitimate grievances of  their subjects as may be found to exist.
-0 O f*1 U &apos;-&apos;)    Gandhi has shewn bitterness especially in  his reference to  affairs inRajkot and Jaipur: and it is noticeable that his animus is  shewn against british officers as such.  In both States members of the Working Committeehave interfered in the former Vallabhai Patel  and in the latter JamnalalBajaj.  Alluding to the ban on Jamnalal&apos;s entry into Jaipur  State, Gandhiannounced that if Jamnalal &quot;disregarded the ban and was arrested and putin jail with his  &quot;peaceful co-workers&quot; Congress would have  no alternative but to make the matter &quot;an all-India issue&quot;.    Thus Congress intentions and practice have gone well beyond the termsof the Haripura and Delhi resolutions; and GandhTs threat may mean that,unless the emissaries of Congress can  have their way in the States, thewhole of India will be brought into the struggle.  Jamnalal  announced his intention of defying the Jaipur ban on  February 1st.    84. Mention must be made of the attitude of those Provincial Govern-ments which have been affected  by trouble in neighbouring States.  Some-thing was said about the attitude of the Orissa Ministry in para. 91 of thelast Survey.   Through November and December they continued to give some assistance in minor ways, but still resisted the application of the dormantprovisions  of  the Indian States  (Protection)  Act, and placed obstacles inthe way of extraditing persons who had been  arrested  in the Province.  Anumber of these belonged to the small State of Talcher,  and the issue was complicated by thousands of the subjects  of that State moving into OrissaProvince where they lived in improvised  shelters and refused to return to theState.  Whatever their grievances may be, the migration was largely due toinstigation from British India.    The murder of Major Bazalgette, the Political Agent, early in Januaryby a riotous mob in  Ranpur State startled and for  the moment shocked allbut the extreme supporters of the agitation in the States.  The Orissa Gpv-ernment agreed to the immediate despatch of a force of provincial police tothe State.   In other respects however the Ministry have  not  materiallymodified their attitude.    The Central Provinces Government have not been helpful in connectionwith  the agitation  in Nandgaon and Hyderabad  States.   The   Ministryrefused to lend police assistance, to  prevent local Congressmen from parti-cipating in the  agitation,  or to give information to the State police.  Anumber of students expelled for  indiscipline from the Osmania Universityin Hyderabad State have been admitted into the Nagpur University.  TheNandgaon  agitation is directed  by the Socialist leader Ruikar from C. P.territory and  from  railway lands which belong  to the Nandgaon State butare not under the State&apos;s jurisdiction.    The Bombay Government have shown less reluctance to help : they areprepared to give routine information and assistance to the Hyderabad police,and to help   the  State  authorities  to  take action against newspaperspublished  in  the Province which after  being banned in the State renewpublication under a new name.   But they refuse to stop parties of volunteersfrom  entering the States so long as their intentions appear to  be non-violent.    With  the Congress High  Command disorganised  at present  as theresult of  Subhas Bose&apos;s successful revolt,  it would be  rash to  make anyprediction of  the action that may be dictated  to Congress Ministries as theresult of  the  agitation in the States.  Gandhi&apos;s personal interest in thestruggle is keen : as recently as January  28th, he complained bitterly in  a&quot;Harijan&quot; article of the action attributed to &quot;the  Imperial power&quot; inRajkot and Jaipur, with  a snarling allusion  to  police and military inRanpur State &quot;having a merry time at  the expense of innocent men andwomen&quot; in revenge for the murder of the Political Agent.  Even the presentdisunion in the Congress may enhance the value  of a battle-cry which wouldunite all sections in the forthcoming session at  Tripuri.  Thus the dangercannot be ignored of a crisis in the Congress Provinces resulting from whatis now proclaimed as a conflict, no longer between States Rulers and their-subjects, but  between Congress and  the Imperial Government.
     85. The Congress President. Throughout his  year  of office  SubhasBose has  kept himself prominently before the public in various parts ofIndia: but,his utterances have received the less consideration, outside left-wing circles, because of  the coolness known  to exist between him and hiscolleagues in the Working Committee.  As the time for the election of thenew President drew near, it was at first generally accepted  that MaulanaAbul Kalam Azad would be  Bose&apos;s successor; he had the backing  of theCongress leaders : and if he had remained in the field it is pretty certainthat the election would have been,  as usual,  uncontested.  He,  after somevacillation, professed himself unequal to the  burden of office and withdrewhis candidature  at  a  late   stage.  Only Subhas   Bose  and  PattabhiSitaramayya were then left in the  lists.  All  the  forces  of  the   high command  were applied   to  prevent  Bose&apos;s  election.  Gandhi himselfrequested him to withdraw :  Jawaharlal Nehru discouraged his candida-ture: and seven other members of the Working Committee, known  to  berepresenting the views of practically the whole body, issued a manifestowhich made it clear that Sitaramayya was the official nominee and Bose anunwelcome interloper.  None of his opponents explained precisely why Bosewas not wanted: the plea that re-election was a most unusual course was  alame pretext: and, as the High Command would not frankly proclaim that both his personality and his politics were disliked, Bose had no difficulty in meeting the  objections to his  candidature.   He accused  his colleagues offsecretly working for the acceptance of  the Federal scheme and condemnedthe attempted &quot;moral coercion&quot; of the electors.     India is for Congress purposes divided into 21 linguistic &quot;provinces&quot; :iin each the primary (&quot;four-anna&quot;)  members  annually elect delegates to theplenary session, the number of the delegates in each &quot;province&quot;  depending on the number of primary members enrolled : and it  is these delegates (over ,000 in number on this occasion) who are empowered to choose, by ballotif the election is contested, the President for the plenary session and the ensuing year.  The delegates had themselves been elected  during the monthof January.     The election held on January  29th resulted in 1575 votes  for  Subhasand 1376 for Sitaramayya : majority 199 in a total poll of 2951.   Therecannot be the slightest doubt that the result was totally  unexpected: Bosehimself had  admitted that his followers were in a minority.   The heaviestpolling was  in Bengal   and the United  Provinces:  in the  former  Bosereceived 80 per cent, of the votes, the two factions in the provincial Congresshaving closed their ranks for the occasion to support  the Bengali candidate:in the latter Bose polled  a handsome  majority.  In the Punjab and theKarnatak &quot;province&quot; also  Bose obtained   good majorities:   in  Bihar,Gujarat and Orissa,  and  naturally   in   Andhra  where  he belongs,Sitaramayya received the greater support: elsewhere the voting was fairlyeven.  The Tamil  &quot;province&quot; produced more  votes  for   Bose than forSitaramayya.  It is too  early to give  a considered  appreciation  of  themeaning and probable outcome of this surprising election. It. appears thatit does not represent as  strong a swing to the left as  the  figures  would suggest.  But estimates  from various quarters agree that it does meansomething in the nature of a revolt against  the  flat dictation practised byGandhi and  his favourite lieutenants, particularly Vallabhbhai Patel: andBose&apos;s majority in three of the four &quot;provinces&quot; which comprise the MadrasPresidency is  regarded  as.a vote against Rajagopalacharfs  policy  and methods in provincial administration regarded as  typical of the mind ofthe High Command. Other factors contributing to Bose&apos;s success were hisgreater fame,  and a special  dislike for  Sitaramayya  in  the  importantprovince of Bengal.     Gandhi has admitted frankly  that Bqse&apos;s victory is  a defeat for him-self.  In a statement issued on January  31st he recalls an article he wrotein October on the defiant attitude of the left wing at the Delhi session of the Congress: in  that article (quoted  in para.  98 of the last survey)  he put forward the view that, if his opponents in the Congress fold continued theirobstruction,  the reins should be handed over to  them, and Gandhi&apos;s party
&quot;should come out of the organisation and practise the Congress programmewhile giving up the Congress label.  Most significantly ^ he now says that hisdefeat gives him an opportunity of putting into practice  what  he  then -preached : and he adds that Subhas Bose&apos;s victory &quot;enables him to choose ahomogeneous Cabinet and enforce his programme without let or hindrance.&quot;Gandhi&apos;s  own followers (now referred to as  &quot;the minority&quot; which is the term  by which he  described his opponents in October) will  find that the&quot;current&quot; (i.e.,  the Gandhian) programme of Congress can  be   workedwhether they are in the Congress or outside  it.  Those who now feel un-cqmf or table in the Congress may come  out.  The threat in  this passage of a division in the Congress ranks is unmistakable.   Less lucid is his utteranceon the position of  Ministers: these have been chosen,  and the programmeshaped, by the erstwhile majority :  &quot;but parliamentary  work is but a minoritem of the Congress programme: Congress Ministers have after all to livefrom  day to day: it matters little to them whether they are recalled on an issue  in which they are in agreement  with the Congress policy or whetherthey resign because they are in disagreement with the  Congress.&quot;   What-ever the significance of these words, they do  show an expectation that the ministries, from one cause or another, may give up office in consequence of circumstances arising  out of the election.    Subhas Bose has  himself  taken his  victory,  with  unwonted modesty:and, perhaps from bewilderment, has  refrained from any  indication of thecourse he  will follow.   He is however  committed to the  view that the Presi-dent is like a Prime Minister rather than a chairman of a deliberative body,and must select his Cabinet for himself.    86. The annual session of the Congress is to be held at  the village ofTripuri in the Central Provinces  in  March.   The Central  ProvincesMinistry, after  making this gesture  of   hospitality,  got into difficulties about collecting the large sum required for the construction of the camp.Money came in slowly  : some of it was embezzled by the Congress secretary,a Muslim - questionable methods of collecting funds  were alleged1:  and theMinistry, with  doubtful propriety, made a special allotment towards theexpenses from Government resources.    87. Internal condition of Congress. Gandhi&apos;s dissatisfaction with thecorruption and  indiscipline of   Congressmen,  and  with their failure to practise true  non-violence,  has been repeatedly expressed.  His statementof January 31st on the election of Subhas Bose  roundly  declared that theCongress  registers  contain a very large number of bogus members, and thata scrutiny would result in  the unseating of  many of the delegates elected on those registers.   This was not an after-thought, calculated to cast doubtson  the result of the election :  for on  the eve of the  election  he had stated the same  view,  and written vehemently about the personation practised atthe elections of  the delegates, and the violent scenes that occurred at thepolls.   As an instance of indiscipline he quoted the defiance of the BiharMinistry  by kisan leaders.   He concluded &quot;Out of the  present conditionof Congress I see nothing but anarchy and red ruin in  front of the  country.Shall we face the harsh truth at Tripuri ?&apos;&apos;  The Working Committee passed a lengthy resolution in December  dealing  with  internal   administrative reform; it aims  at ridding Congress of bogus members by a  revision of allmembership  registers  and by the introduction  of constitutional changes toprevent the   enrolment of  unqualified  members;  qualifications  alreadyprescribed are to be strictly observed; and  election  to  the  executives of Congress bodies  is  to be restricted to members of at least three years&apos; stand-ing   The resolution (if carried into  action)  should place difficulties in theway of the plans of the Socialists  and Communists for capturing executivecommittees and other  responsible bodies.     88  The Rupee Ratio.-On December 14th  the Working  Committee massed a  resolution, referring to the Government  communique of June 1938 (see para. 113 of Survey No. 4), and  stating  their  reasons for making a positive demand that the rate should be lowered from Is  6d.  to Is  id. The full  text of the resolution is in Appendix I.   It stated that since June     405(S) SeoytoGGPublie
the balance of trade has turned, more-and more against India,  that  thepresent rate has hit agriculturists hard by lowering the price of commoditiesproduced by them,  and that it.gives an unfair advantage to imports:  thepresent rate has been maintained by large exports of gold which :have beeninjurious to the country, and can now only be maintained by contractingcurrency and  credit and by further   depletion  of  the  gold&apos; and sterlingresources of India.  The Government immediately replied to this-demand in a communique which, by reference.to recent figures of the trade balanceand the trend of prices and of the proportion of gold and sterling reserves to the note  issue, completely controverted each of the specific grounds allegedfor it: the conviction was stated that.a lowering of  the ratio would causeno appreciable rise in the prices of agricultural products but would imme-diately raise the prices of what the cultivator needs tcrbuy : it would seriouslyweaken the budgetary/position of the Central Government and the largerProvincial  Governments; and would benefit no one except the monied  andspeculative interests : the Government would  defend the present  exchange value of  the rupee bv every means in their power, and  were  completelyconfident of their ability.to maintain it.    The  press which speaks both for Congress and for Indian capitalismattributed  the views of Government to a desire to protect British Officersremitting their savings to England  and the interests of  British manufac-turers, and declared that India  was determined  to have a lower ratio  andwould  get  it soon, notwithstanding the opposition  of Government.   Boseand Satyamurti have made statements indicating  that the  Congress doesnot intend  to accept the Government verdict as by any  means final.  OnJanuary  23rd the  Viceroy,  speaking in Bombay,  repeated governments intention of doing everything in their power to maintain the ratio.  (It isworthy of  mention that the Punjab  Government in the middle of Januarymade a statement giving reasons for their dissent  from the demand for  a lower ratio.).    89. Attitude to &quot;untouchables&quot;. The  Malabar.  Temple Entrv Bill,Avhich was described in para. 96 of the last Survey, was passed by the MadrasLegislature early in December,  and  received  the  Governors   assent inJanuary.    90. Attitude to Indians Overseas. According  to  a press report theAga Khaii  has persuaded Gandhi to agree to sending V&amp;lla-bhbhai Patel to east Africa in May next in connection with the interests of  Indians living-there.  It has been alleged that Patel will in some degree be concerned with indian opposition to the return of East African colonies to Germany.    91. &quot;The National Planning Committee&quot;. From the  conference  of congress. Ministers for Industries held  at  the  beginning of October  has emerged  a  scheme for a &quot;National Planning Committee&quot;.    Mention  hasalready been made (in para. 20)  of the response by  Provincial governments to the  Committee&apos;s demand for  financial assistance.   The Committee heldits first session under the chairmanship  of  Jawaharlal  Nehru,  recentlyreturned from Europe,  on December 17th, when Subhas  Bose inauguratedthe proceedings.  The object of national planning is stated to be to improve the well-being of the community by intensifying economic development in ksystematic  manner; it is.hoped to &quot;double the standard of living&quot; within aperiod of five  to ten years at the most,   A questionnaire has been  issued toProvincial  Governments, Indian States, organisations of trade, commerce,labour and agricultural interests, in order to collect the necessary  data  andto obtain helpful suggestions.  The questionnaire seeks information regard-ing raw materials, resources available, transport facilities,  and numerousother subjects.    92. Enlistments to the Congress party for 1938 totalled about  45 lakhs,compared with 30^ lakhs in 1937 : one extra month was allotted for enrol-ments in 1938- Gandhi and the Working Committee are sufficient authorityfor the view that the registers contain many bogus names.
                        (b)  The Muslim League..;    93.  Relations with Congress.-The negotiations for a settlement between. Congress and the Muslim League  have been closed.   The  Congress Presi- president&apos;s reply to Jinnah&apos;s letter  of  October  9th   (which was mentioned in para, 99 of the last Survey) shut  the &apos;door at last; after stating, that the Congress Working Committee found it impossible to  agree&apos;to the basis of the negotiations, it continued &quot;The Working Committee regret  that they are not  in a position to do anything further in the  direction of starting-negotiations with the League with  a view to &quot;arriving at a settlement of the Hindu-Muslim question&quot;.   This was in December.     At the session of the Muslim League at Patna&apos;at the.end of the same month Jinnah laid the blame for  the  breakdown on Congress, who had &quot;dashed every possible hope for arriving  at a settlement on the rocks of congress fascism&quot;.   This was followed by a  resolution  which  accused certain  Congress Ministries  of Committing   &quot;atrocities&quot;  on  the  Muslim minority, and &quot;authorised  the  Working  Committee  to  resort to &quot;direct action&quot;  if  necessary (for text see Appendix II).   The Ministries con- cerned have been at pains to refute these charges; and when the Congress Working Committee met in  January, it is understood to have framed an  instrument of instructions&quot; to Congress Ministries,  calling upon them togive proper representation  to Muslims in  Congress, cabinets,  local bodies and  public  services, to assist in the enrolment of  Muslims, as members of&quot;Congress, and not  to-cause  offence by  flying the Congress flag or singingBande Mataram in opposition to Muslims&apos; wishes.     It appears then that the Congress,  while giving  up  the attempt tonegotiate with the, Muslim League, desire  to find  other  means of wooingMuslim support.   Though it is  easy for Congress dialecticians to rebut theclumsy arguments and. allegations  of the rivaL Organisation, the  Congress,claiming to represent the whole people bf  India,  makes  no   progress inwinning the allegiance of the Muslim community.   Congress machinations in Indian States have alarmed the  Muslims; signs of the League&apos;s militantopposition &quot;are the resolution authorising the committee to resort to &quot;direct action&quot;, the use of the Congress weapon   of  satyagraha  in  the  Central Provinces to protest against  the &quot;Vidya Maridir&quot; scheme, and the develop-xnent of the idea of a separate Federation for Muslim areas.  The  ExecutiveCouncil &quot;of the League in December appointed a committee to send  deputa- tions to  the Punjab, Sind, the N.-W. F. P., and Islamic countries  abroad,to acquaint them with the repressive policy  of Congress towards the Muslim minority.                       :     In  the  middle  of January a visit of the Aga Khan to Gandhi  aroused much speculation; it has been suggested that one object of the meeting was to approach, independently of Jinnah and the Muslim League, the problem of a settlement with the Congress.                                     &apos;     94.  The Patiia session.-^The annual general session  of,the All-India Muslim  League was held at Patna from December 25th ,.to the. 28th.  The full text of  the most important resolutions passed will be found in  Appendix II.  Jinnah had previously been returned  unopposed as President.  . The session is considered to have been the most, successful ever held and displayed the  remarkable advance which has attended ,Jinnah&apos;s  plans for raising the League  to the status of a powerful and coherent political force. , Enthu- siasm was militant,  and at times  hysterical,  and there was a note of defiance in the  discussions which  Jinnah  and the more temperate leaders found it difficult to moderate.   Sustained  and bitter  hostility  to Congress was combined with a large degree of anti-British feeling.  The outstanding feature  of the session was the enunciation  of a new revolutionary principle in the  &quot;direct; action&quot;  resolution.    The  Bihar group were in  favour oi heincr  authorised to start satyagraha when and where they liked, but the wordino- of the resolution seems to have been dictated by practical consi-&apos; derations-; civil- disobedience by Muslims in a Congress Province could onlV provoke retaliation in  Provinces  predominantly  Muslim.   Anti-British
 feeling was concentrated on British policy in Palestine and on the  alleged apathy of Governors in Congress Provinces towards the Muslim minority.     95. The League  and Federation. The change  of  Congress  policy towards agitation in Indian States is an  irritant  to Muslims.   Apart altogether  from sympathy with Muslim Rulers, e.g., the Nizam, Muslim feeling has been  roused by the political design behind the movement the design to  make Federation safe for Congress by compelling the Rulers to accept popular election as the method of appointing the States&apos;  representa- tives  in the Central Legislature.    The resolutions passed on  the  Indian States and on Federation by,  first, the  Executive  Council of the League and later  the Patna session,  should be read  together (see Appendix II). The Executive  Council, meeting early in December  in  Delhi,  countered Gandhi&apos;s threats  addressed to the  Rulers and the British Government with a warning of dire consequences if  the British Government yielded to them : the Patna  resolution on  Indian States declared that,  if  Congress did  not desist from its subversive activities in the States, the League would be forced to take action to  guard its interests.   The,Patna resolution on Federation authorised the President to explore the possibility of &quot;a suitable alternative which would completely safeguard the interests of  Mussalmans  and other minorities in India&quot; : this vague phrase is known to cover, if not to endorse, the scheme of a separate Muslim federation which was mentioned in para. 101 of the last Survey.     Sir Abdulla Haroon, the principal exponent of  this scheme,  addressed a letter  in November  to about fifteen States, in which  he gave further details of it.  The Muslim and Hindu federations would be based as far  as possible on geographical convenience and similarity of outlook; each would include such States  as desired affiliation.  The Muslim  federation  would allow  to minorities such rights as the  other   federation would allow  to Muslims.   Federating  States would have complete internal  freedom gua- ranteed and their treaties with the Paramount Power  would be preserved. All minorities would have a statutory guarantee permitting them to adhere to their own religion, customs, language and personal laws.  The nucleus of the federation  would   be  the   north-western  Provinces and  Kashmir State.    96. &quot;Attitude  to war. &quot;When the Executive  Council met early in Dec- ember, a resolution was moved criticising Sir Sikandar Hayafs pledge  of the complete support of the Punjab in the event of a war (see para.  109 of the last Survey).  Accounts differ as to the trend of the discussion thereon. According to the  pro-Congress press,   Sir   Sikandar  was   rebuked and humbled : his own account is that  Jinnah spoke in praise of the offending pronouncement, and took the earliest opportunity of closing the discussion by insisting on the withdrawal of the resolution.   That on one occasion  or another there has been some explaining away of the uncalculating generosity of the  pledge seems certain.  It is probable, and not unnatural, that among Muslims  Sir  Sikandar  would  wish  it  to  be   regarded   as quali- fied by a reservation that no advantage should be taken of Punjab support for action detrimental to the interests of Muslims in any part of the world.    97 General. The progress of Muslim League volunteer organisations is described  in para. 43.  The League&apos;s lack of political ability is illus-trated  by its failure to keep the Saadullah Ministry in  power in Assam,  orto dominate the Sind Ministry, or to upset Congress control of the Govera-ment of the Frontier Province.                    (c) Other opposition to Congress.    98. The session of the All-India Hindu Mahasabha  held  in  Nagpurat the end of December was attended by immense crowds,&apos; including a con-tingent of volunteers armed with swords and lathis.  Strong anti-Congressfeeling was in evidence, though a Congress emissary is said to have been sent
t-o dissuade the Mahasabha authorities from passing any anti-Congress reso-lution.  Savarkar, the President, in his inaugural address asserted extrava-gant claims for the Mahasabha,  describing the Hindus as the Indian nation and Muslims  as  but  a  communal minority; he  attacked the Congress forturning against the Hindus who had  raised it to power, and declared thatHindus should vote, not for Congress, but only  for genuine Hindu nation-Nationalists.  Among a large number  of  resolutions, the session, alarmed by the design attributed to the Muslim League to organise a federation of Muslimunits,  desired the  inauguration of the statutory federal  scheme howeverdefective it may be; condemned  Congress only less vigorously than Muslimsand claimed that the  Mahasabha was the  only national organisation in thecountry; and demanded general military training in order to counteract thepreponderance of Muslims in the Indian army and to lay the foundation fora national militia.    99. At about the same time the  National Liberal Federation held  itssession  in  Poona, under the Presidency  of P.  N.  Sapru (member of theCouncil of State), who dealt in  familiar  terms  with the modifications re-quired in the administration of  defence and with the economic  problems ofthe country, but  for the most part  criticised the Congress programme and practice the  demand for  a constituent  assembly and  threat  of renewedcivil disobedience in opposition  to the Pederal scheme; the  &quot;totalitarian&quot;tendency of the High.  Command; its financial policy of unnecessary sacrifice of revenue, ill-judged economies, and new taxation for  expenditure  onhastily considered schemes; the failure to separate judicial and executive functions;  and the unsound basis of the Wardha educational scheme.  Oneresolution while describing the new constitution as utterly unsatisfactorystated the amendments which would make it acceptable; another cautiouslyadvised Indian Princes to satisfy the legitimate aspirations of their peoplesfor civil and political liberties; the Congress &quot;Working  Committee&apos;s inter-ference  with Provincial Ministries was strongly  condemned; and  a demand was put forward for the rapid nationalisation  of  India&apos;s  defence forces,the speedier development of the Indian Army and Air Porce,  and  system-atic organisation of air-raid precautions.              VII.-SPECIAL  PROBLEMS.r                             (a) Palestine.    100. The report of the Woodhead Commission and the British Govern-rnenfs  findings thereon at first attracted  little attention in  India;  theabandonment of partition was generally welcomed; Indian Muslims appear-ed to be content  to await the results  of the London conference.  Early inNovember the &quot;Palestine Defence Committee&quot; (mentioned in para. 104 ofthe last Survey) decided to begin civil  disobedience at the end of that month;but later,  when  it was  seen that educated Muslim opinion favoured theLondon conference, they resolved to postpone action until  the  decisions ofthe conference were  made known.  But  at  the session of  the  All-IndiaMuslim League held at Patna at the end of December great excitement wasroused by the discussions on Palestine; rabid abuse of the British Govern -ment was uttered, and Jinnah and  other responsible leaders had some diffi-culty in restraining talk of  jihad.   The  resolution on the   subject  (seeAppendix  II for the  full text) condemned the whole policy of the BritishGovernment in Palestine, and &quot;atrocities and cruelties&quot; perpetrated in pur-suance of it; demanded that the  immigration of Jews should cease, and thatthe Grand Mufti as  well as representative Indian Muslims should be. in-cluded in the conference; and proclaimed that Indian Muslims would be pre-pared to make any sacrifices if justice were not  done to the Arabs.    For various reasons His Majesty&apos;s Government found it impracticable to accept a suggestion that the  Aga Khan should be formally associated *    405(S) SecytoGGPublio
with the conference on behalf of Indian Muslims:  but  the  Secretaries offState for India and the Colonies have had the advantage of discussion withhim.    Gandhi has twice expressed his views on the Palestine problem.   Heholds the balance nicely between the  claims  of Jew and Arab, expressinghis sympathy with the Jews but denying their right to a national home inPalestine which belongs to the Arabs: the Jews should make their homes.in the countries where  they earn their livelihood.  Both in  Germany, andin the struggle with the Arabs in Palestine,  satyagraha should be theirweapon.     There is no real interest in the Palestine question outside Muslim cir-cles, but  the Congress is careful to  keep oh its agenda a subject whichoffers the rare  chance of standing beside Muslims in opposition to British,Imperialism.   The Working  Committee (see Appendix I)  in  Decemberreiterated its sympathy with the Arabs, and amplified previous pronounce-ments in condemnation of  &quot;atrocities&quot; committed  by British troops  and police: the Jews were reproved for relying on British arms for protection;and both races  were vaguely exhorted to co-operate in establishing ah admi-administration based oh the principle of self-determination.                           (b) &quot;Prohibition&quot;.     101.  Again no progress has been made with the introduction of &quot;pro-hibition&quot; in non-Congress Provinces.     Writing in  the  &quot;Harijan&quot; on December 24th   Gandhi stressed the signal importance of &quot;prohibition&quot; as a part of the  Congress programmer he found fault with the Congress Ministers, including even  the  devoted Rajagopalachari, for their cautious  and calculating  approach to the  pro- blem : the loss  of excise revenue must be made up by  fresh taxation, parti- cularly of industrialists in urban areas who  profit by  the increased sobriety of their workers : in the last  resort the Central Government must be asked for grants or loans without interest: unless a rapid  advance is made,  the goal of complete &quot;prohibition&quot; will  not be  reached within  the three years prescribed by the Working Committee.     In most Provinces the revenue that would be lost by total &apos; prohibition&apos; &apos; is second only to the land revenue demand: the zeal of  Ministries  for  a reform which  would cripple  their &quot;nation-building&quot; schemes is generally well below that of Gandhi : but under his urgent pressure it may be expect- ed that further sacrifices of this item of revenue will be made in all Con- gress Provinces in the coming financial year.     The Bombay Government are said to  have  decided  to   extend the measure  to two  more districts in April next; it is also to be extended to Bombay city and suburbs, but the  question of how to finance this extension is under consideration. One of the Ministry&apos;s suggestions is that the Cen- tral  Government should !be moved  to  sanction cuts in service salaries.  All liquOr and toddy shops will  be closed in Bombay city  on  each day in the mOnth fixed for the payment of Wages and on the following day (see para. 105 of the last Survey).  In the Central Provinces the districts of Wardha and Akola &quot;went dry&quot; on January  1st.      The new  Congress coalition Ministry in Assam are  considering total prohibition of the consumption of opium in  the two worst opium-consuming areas, as well as the closing of all liquor shops on Sundays; the latter measure will particularly affect tea-gardens, where Saturday is pay-day and Sunday is a holiday.      Reports from Bihar, Bombay and the  United Provinces indicate that the Provincial Governments  profess  satisfaction with  the  results of  their experiments,  though  it is too soon  yet to  calculate the  economic benefits&quot; which have accrued.   In Madras,  the Government report on the working of  &quot;prohibition&apos;- in  Salem  district  during the first  year claims success  for
               (d) The Congress flag and Bande Mataram.    103. Early in November Gandhi, commenting on a complaint that theCongress flag was used  in  rivalry with religious symbols or for factiouspurposes, admitted the truth of it: if he had his way the flag would not beexhibited at any meeting, other than a purely Congress meeting, if a single person objected :  the flag is out of place in religious gatherings or proces-sions :  and &quot;in the present tension&quot; Gandhi would not  hoist it on Govern-ment buildings or municipal offices unless by unanimous consent.    Little is now heard of the exhibition of the Congress flag or the singingof Bahde Mataram,  except as a standing grievance of anti-Congress orgahi-sations.                        (e) War  and Recruiting.    104. Public interest in India&apos;s attitude to a war in which Britain mightbe involved has  naturally waned with the passing of the crisis in Europe.There is no reason to revise the estimate made in para. 109  of the lastSurvey of the attitude  that would then have been  adopted by Congress ingeneral and Congress Ministries in particular,  if war had broken out.   Butthere are influences which  may have  an  increasing effect in opposition tothe Gandhian demand for complete dissociation from war in any circums-tances.   First, there seems to be a growing recognition that India will notbe unaffected by  a great war, and by  its results : this may be explained -inpart by the progress of Japanese  aggression.   Those who put any faith inJawaharlal Nehru&apos;s announcement that the British Empire is doomed mustface the question what then will  become of India.  Secondly, India is notunaffected by the identification of nationalism  with militarism in a numberof countries: and the confidence that has been bred  by provincial autonomyand the hope of obtaining control of Defence under Federation have inspireda more purposeful demand for the right,  if not the obligations, of militaryservice.  Thus the  United Provinces Government  have made a request tothe Central Government for assistance in a  scheme of  compulsory militarythe measure; and the Collector&apos;s report states that it is removing &quot;one ofthe main causes of indebtedness, semi-starvation, unhappiness and degrada-tion&quot;.   The Professor of Economics in the University of Madras has recent-ly estimated the economic results; the earnings of former drinkers have not increased except in the case of some mill-labourers, and those of some work-ers have actually  fallen owing  to certain unfavourable physiological andpsychological reactions, which may not be permanent:  most of the  moneyformerly used for  drink  has been  diverted  to the  purchase  of food and clothing, some to the repayment of  debt, and not much to the purchase of tobacco:  there has been a striking increase in the consumption of tea, brass-ware utensils are  to some extent replacing earthenware, and cinemas are more frequented : urban labourers are more inclined to purchase books.  he added  that  it is still too soon to calculate economic  results with certainty;but if &quot;prohibition&quot; continues  successfully further improvement  in the welfare of the working classes and a  steady expansion of trade and businessmight be expected.                     (c)  G-ujarat Lands  (Bombay).    102. After consulting the Governor-General, the Governor  of Bombayin November gave his assent to  the Forfeited Lands Restoration Bill  (des-cribed  in paragraph 106  of  the last Survey).  The Act was  brought intoforce on  December 13th,  and the necessary notifications have been issued.Not many owners  have agreed voluntarily to accept the terms of the  Act,so the  majority  of  cases will have to be decided by the tribunal: a HighCourt judge has been appointed as the tribunal.
 training in the higher stages of the educational system : the growing interest in Air Raid Precautions is described below:  and reliable secret information shows that Asaf Ali, a prominent member of the Congress party  in  the Central Assembly, expressed to Jawaharlal Nehru in December a view which illustrates the consciousness of political disadvantages in a creed of non- violence.  Asaf Ali deplored Gandhi&apos;s attitude to the September crisis, and argued that, if Congress subscribed to the view that armed forces are un- necessary, the British Government could then more plausibly decline to hand over control of defence and external affairs.     The interest of the Muslims in the Army, service in which is of material and political  importance to the Punjab especially,  discourages them from participation  in propaganda against recruiting  or  against India assisting in a war.  But sympathy with the Arabs of Palestine, and in some  degree with the  tribes on the frontier-affected by  the alleged  &quot;forward policy&quot;, would make the League hostile to the  Army  being used for purposes consi- dered to be prejudicial to Islam.     105.  Air-raid Precautions. As a result of the recommendations of a committee set up to examine this subject, the Government of India came to certain conclusions in June last and conveyed them in the form of  advice to  Provincial  Governments, who were informed that  if they wished to adopt the proposals the Central Government would be ready to assist in technical  matters and in co-ordination.  A somewhat modified appreciation of the nature and extent of the danger, and of the measures to be  taken,was issued in January.     Provincial  Governments generally are co-operating; Congress Govern- ments have made the stipulation that such measures as are at present being undertaken shall  not involve any expenditure.   The Bombay Governmentquestioned the Centre&apos;s  view that expenditure  on  all  measures taken in prosecution of civil air-raid precautions should be civil departmental expen- diture and not expenditure on defence, and that  all measures for the general protection of  the public,  as opposed to the  special  protection  of certain sections thereof, would be a charge on Provincial  or municipal  revenues. They argued  that defence should include all measures  adopted to protect the country from enemy acts of aggression,  and that  air-raids  are acts of aggression undertaken not only to damage important works but  to terrorise the civil population as part of military strategy.  Expenditure on precau- tions calculated to increase civilians&apos; power of resistance  should therefore be treated as expenditure on defence, and borne  by  Central revenues  under section 33(3)(e) of the Government of India Act.  The Central Government, disagreeing with this opinion, held that as the term &quot;defence&quot; is not defined in the Act, it must,  so  far as executive functions  go, be regarded  as co- extensive  with the relevant entries in the Federal Legislative List, in  whichneither &quot;defence&quot; nor &quot;air-raid precautions&quot; find a place: air-raid precau- tions are a collection of non-military measures, expenditure on them is incurred by civil authorities in the executive field of civil government, andthe incidence and classification of it will be  governed by the usual practice and procedure.   At the same time the Central Government recognised thata Provincial Government might have more  cogent  grounds in equity forfavourable treatment, should they ever have to incur extraordinary expendi- ture on such precautions; and they undertook  to consider claims for financialassistance, under section 150 (2) of the Act,  should the necessity ever arise.Such assistance would presuppose prior scrutiny and   approval  of  theexpenditure.   The measures hitherto  recommended need  not involve anyProvince  in any considerable expenditure, so no assistance is yet contem-plated.     The resolution of the All-India Congress passed at  Haripura nearly ayear ago on &quot;foreign policy and war danger&quot; included air raid precautionsamong the preparatory measures of which the Congress entirely disapproved.It is worthy of note that Congress Ministries have not regarded themselves as bound by this doctrine.                    i                ;

The Criminal Law Amendment Act penalising dissuasion  from1enlistment in the Army and instigation of mutiny (see para. 112 of the lastSurvey), the passing of which excited such acrimony during the last Simlasession, has not been brought into force in any Province: even the PunjabGovernment, at whose&apos; instance it was passed, prefer to wait and choose theirown time  for its application.  The number  of speeches directed againstrecruiting in the Province is said to have decreased since the Act was passed.Information as to conditions throughout the  area  (the U. P.  is the mostaffected, besides  the Punjab) where such propaganda was common  is not sufficiently recent to permit of an estimate of the probable effect of the enact-inent.

The special session of the Central Assembly, which wassummoned  for consideration of the Select Committee&apos;s report on the IndianIncome-tax (Amendment) Bill, lasted from November 10th to December 12th.The strength of the Muslim League party has now  risen  to  26.   with official representatives also numbering 26, and support among the nominatednon-officials and unattached members, the Government are now in a positionto carry any proposal if the alliance of the Muslim League and the EuropeanGroup is obtained.   Discussion of the  Income-tax Bill  occupied nearly thewhole of the session and little other business of interest  was transacted.    The Indian Income-tax ^Amendment) Bill. So far  as the Bill aimed athigher taxation of large incomes,  stopping gaps in the law which  enabledtaxation to be evaded, and an easing of procedure in favour of the honesttaxpayer, its provisions met with  fairly general acceptance.  The congress party lent  their co-operation; their leader,  Bhulabhai  Desai, had  thrownhimself whole-heartedly into constructive work on the  Bill in Select Com-mittee.  The Congress attitude may be attributed in part to the desire to benefit the  finances of Provincial  Governments by increasing one  item of central revenue which is shared with those Governments; and in part to the expectation of coming into office at the Centre under Federation.   Contro-versy arose mainly over certain clauses which were alleged to discriminatein favour of British and other non-domiciled residents  in India.  The lawas it stands taxes income accruing or arising or received in or brought into british India.  The Bill proposed to tax also the whole foreign income ofdomiciled residents in India, not merely the income remitted to India.  the distinction  made between domiciled residents and -non-domiciled residents,i.e., foreigners in India, including Europeans and subjects of Indian States,was that the former were to be taxed on ah their income, wherever it might arise, while the latter were  to be taxed on their income which  accrued orarose  in or was received in or brought  into British India, and any income from  business,  profession or vocation  which arose outside  British Indiawhether it  was  brought in or not.   Opposition to this clause was expected;but when  the Congress party amendment for deletion of the clause was moved it received  the united support of all parties including the  EuropeanGroup,  which disclaimed a desire for discrimination in favour of  Britishinterests.   This clause was considered so vital by Government that for sometime the fate of the whole Bill hung in the balance.  A  conference of party leaders succeeded  in reaching a compromise,  by the complicated provisionsof which the appearance of undue discrimination was removed and the taxa-tion of income  accrued abroad was relaxed by the exemption of a  certain    406(S) SeeytoGGPublio
portion.   The position under the Bill now is as follows:-Persons who arenot resident in British India will pay only on income arising or received in British India; persons who are resident but &quot;not ordinarily&quot; resident inBritish India  will pay on income arising in British India and on foreignincome as well, subject to an exempted amount of Rs: 4,500 (about  340).&quot;Ordinary residence&quot; has been so defined  as to exclude persons  who  havenot spent  a  considerable  time in  the  country.    Only  the  CongressNationalist  party of 11 opposed this compromise till the end,  actuatedapparently by a  desire to show that they  are not an  integral part of theCongress  party  as their usual behaviour might indicate,  and  by  theiradherence generally  to old-fashioned anti-State  and  individualist ideas.Their opposition did not hinder the easy  passage of the Bill in its amendedform.     Other business. Amendments made in two  Bills by the Council  ofState were accepted by the Assembly.  Four other official Bills were passedduring the session; one lowers the educational  qualification entitling aperson to be enrolled  as an elector  to a municipality in Ajmer-Merwara;another reimposes on imported  wheat  and  wheat flour  until the end  ofMarch, 1940, a duty first imposed in  1931 and allowed to lapse last year.  a motion to circulate an innocuous measure for regulating the extent to whichrailway property should be  liable to taxation by local  authorities in theProvinces was thrown out by the combined efforts of the Congress and theAluslim League;  the principal motive appeared-to be reluctance to arm thepresent &quot;irresponsible&quot; Central Government with  a power which would pass to the Federal Railway Authority on  its institution.     The private Bill to give Hindu women a  right  to  divorce has been circulated for public opinion; and the time for the presentation of theSelect Committee&apos;s report on the Muslim Dissolution of Marriage Bill hasbeen extended.   .     The House  expressed its disapproval of the present form of administra-tion in Ajmer-Merwara by refusing an excess grant of Rs. 27 to regulariseexpenditure incurred in excess of the grant voted in 1936-37.   An adjourn-ment motion which was carried without a division disapproved of the recenterection (by private enterprise) of a memorial to troops who fell  in a minorengagement during  the siege of Delhi in 1857; the objection was mainly to the description of the mutineers as such,  and to the  Government of  India having associated  themselves  with  the  occasion by the  presence   of  the Commander-in-Chief.     The Governor-General&apos;s use of his power  to  disallow  questions and motions once again  called forth Congress protests.     During the session the death occurred of Maulana  Shaukat Ali, once notorious as a Khilafat agitator, and latterly a prominent personality  in the Muslim League partyJ     The House adjourned as  a mark of  respect to the memory of Kemal Ataturk; the speeches  glorified his resuscitation of the Turkish nation; those of Hindu members also praised his social and legal reforms, but on this point the Muslim speakers were silent.                       (b)  The Council of State.    109. The session of the Council of State opened on January 23rd.   Itis unusual  for the Council session to commence before that of the CentralAssembly,  but on this occasion it was imperative for the Income-tax Billto be passed in  order  to permit  the new scales to be incorporated in  thebudget.  In the  course of the first five days&apos; sittings, the Council passed theIncome-tax Bill, the Bill reimposing the duty on imported wheat,  and  the motor Vehicles  Bill, as well  as  three smaller measures.   There  being  nofurther business  before the House, the session was adjourned for a fortnight.An adjournment motion to discuss a serious railway disaster which occurred in Bihar in January was withdrawn when the Government announced that
earnest consideration would be given to the Bihar Governments request foran inquiry.            IX-THE  FEDERAL  COURT.    110, The Federal Court was formally inaugurated on October 1st, 1937,with Sir Maurice Gwyer as Chief Justice, and two other Judges, Sir ShahMuhammad Sulaiman and Mr. Jayakar.  The last named has recently beenappointed to the Privy Council; his successor has not yet been named.    Of the three cases so far decided by the Court, only one deserves detailedmention a special reference by the  Governor General under Section 213 ofthe Government of India Act.  This important reference enquired whether any of the provisions of the  Central Provinces and Berar Sales of motor spirit and Lubricants Taxation Act, 1938, is ultra vires of the ProvincialLegislature.  Section 3 (1) of that Act is in these terms: -&quot;There shall be levied and collected  from every retail  dealer a tax on the retail sales of motor spirit and lubricants at the rate of five per- cent, on the value of suchsales&quot;.  On behalf of the Central Government it was argued that this  faxis an  excise on goods manufactured or produced in India and  falls withinentry (45) of the Federal Legislative List and is therefore an intrusion upona field of taxation reserved for the Federal Legislature  (which is at presentthe Central Legislature).   The Provincial Government urged that the  taxfalls  within entry (48) of the Provincial Legislative List as a tax on  thesale of goods and is therefore within the exclusive competence of the Provin-cial Legislature.  A second argument on behalf of the  Central  Governmentwas that even  if the Act were within the competence  of  the ProvincialLegislature, it is nevertheless invalid by reason of the non-obstante provisionof section  100(1)  read with section  100(3)  of  the  Act, which makes  theFederal power prevail if  Federal and Provincial Legislative powers over-lap.  The  Provincial Government claimed that the entries do not overlapbut are mutually exclusive.    The Court delivered  its  opinion on December 2nd, 1938,  to the effectthat the Act is within the competence of the Provincial Legislature.  Thisdecision  is  of  great importance, placing beyond  question  the right of provincial Governments to impose taxation over a wide field.  Alreadyseveral other Provinces are considering legislation to impose such taxation.    Another case involving a conflict between the Central and  a provincial government is also before the Court; judgment has not yet been delivered.The United Provinces Government  are claiming from  the Central Govern-ment the return of all fines collected by Cantonment courts since  1934  anddemanding that in  future all  such fines shall  be credited   to Provincialrevenues.
                               APPENDIX   I.  Resolutions passed by the Congress Working Committee,  at Wardha, December  1938.                                   1. INDIAN STATES.     &quot;The Working Committee  welcome the  awakening of the people of  Indian States  inmany  parts of the country  and consider  this as- a hopeful prelude to a larger freedomcomprising the whole of India for which the Congress has laboured.     &quot;The committee support the demand for civil liberty and responsible government underthe  aegis of the rulers in States and express their solidarity with these movements forfreedom and self-expression.     &quot;While appreciating that some rulers  of  States have recognised this  awakening  as  a healthy sign of growth and are seeking to adjust themselves  to it in co-operation with their people, the  committee regret that  other rulers have sought  to  suppress these movementsby banning  peaceful  and legitimate organisations and  all political activity  and,  in  somecases,  resorting to  cruel and  inhuman repression.     &quot;In particular, the committee deplore the attempt of some rulers to seek the aid  ofthe British  Government in India to suppress  their own people, and the committee assertthe right of  the Congress to protect the people against unwarranted use of military or police forces  lent  by the  British authorities for  the suppression of the legitimate  movement  ofthe people for responsible governments within the States.   &quot;The committee desire  to draw attention  afresh  to the  resolution  of  the HaripuraCongress, which  defines Congress policy in  regard to the  States.  While it is the right and  privilege  of the Congress to work for  the attainment of civil liberty and responsible government  in the States,  the  existing circumstances  impose certain  limitations  on this work and considerations of prudence prevent the Congress from intervening organisationallyand  directly in the internal struggles -in the States.   &quot;This policy was conceived in the best interests of the people to enable  them to developeself-reliance and strength.  It was  also intended  as a measure of goodwill of the Congresstowards the States and of its hope that the rulers of their own accord would recognise thespirit of the times and satisfy the just aspirations of their people.  Experience has provedthe wisdom  of this policy.   But this was never conceived as an obligation.  The Congresshas always reserved the right, as it  is its duty, to guide the  people of the States and lendthem its influence.  With the great awakening that is taking place  among  the people  ofthe  States,  there must  be an  increasing  identification  of  the Congress with  the Statespeople.  The  policy laid down  by the Haripura  Congress, which has been  so abundantlyjustified, must continue to be pursued.     &quot;While, therefore, the  Working  Committee  welcome the  movements  in  the states for the attainment  of&apos; responsible government, they advise the people not belonging to theStates concerned  against taking part in civil  disobedience  or the like.  Participation by such - people will bring no real strength  to the  movement  and may  even embarrass thepeople of the States  concerned and prevent  them from developing a mass  movement onwhich  strength and success depend.     &quot;The committee trust  that all movements  in the States  will adhere strictly to thefundamental Congress policy of  non-violence.&quot;                                 2. THE RUPEE RATIO.     Since the fixation of the ratio at 1 sh. 6 d. to the rupee  all trade interests in India andpublic  bodies  have protested  that this measure is against the vital economic interests  ofIndia and have insistently demanded its revision.  The.  Government of  India have  hithertoresisted  all  these attempts  and last issued a  communique  on June  6,  1938, declaring that it did not intend making any change in the ratio for the time being and in support ofthat declaration sought to rely merely on the  instability and uncertainty during the periodof readjustment, which,  according  to them,  was likely  to  cause greater loss  to  Indianinterests than any corresponding gain from the change to a lower ratio.   Since June  last thebalance of trade has turned more and more against India.  The committee are of opinionthat the rate  of exchange of 1  sh.  6 d.  to  the rupee has hit hard the  agriculturist of thiscountry by  lowering the price of agricultural commodities and given an undue and unfairadvantage to imports into this country.  The Working Committee is satisfied that the rateof 1 sh.  6 d.  cannot  any longer be  maintained on the  balance  of trade.   During the lastseven  years  that  rate has been  maintained by large exports of gold which have been veryinjurious to the country.   Matters have&apos;now  reached a stage  when the rate can  only bemaintained  by a  policy of contraction of currency and  credit and  by  further depletion  ofthe  gold and  sterling resources of  India  and particularly  the Paper  Currency Reserve.Those  sterling resources  have already been used  up to  an alarming extent and there is  a danger of further  serious  depletion taking place if efforts  continue to be  made  by theGovernment of India to maintain the present ratio.  The Working Committee look upon such prospect  with the utmost concern and  anxiety.     405(S) SecytoGGPublic
     In view of this situation the Working Committee have come to  the conclusion  thatthe best interests of the  country demand that efforts to maintain the present exchangelevel  should henceforth cease and urge upon the Govemor-General-in-Council&quot; the necessityof taking immediate steps to lower the rate to  1 sh. 4 d.  to  the rupee.                                     3. PALESTINE.    &quot;The Working Committee has  passed resolutions from  time  to time  dealing with the changing situation in Palestine and  sympathizing with the  struggle of Arabs to maintain.their  political and national integrity.  Reports are continuously  coming in from a variety of reliable sources of unnamable atrocities committed by the British military  and police on&apos;the plea of maintaining law and order in this mandatory  territory.  The courage, deter-mination and sacrifices made by the Arabs in this life and death  struggle have evoked theadmiration of the people of India, who once more wish to  convey to them their good wishesfor their complete success in the attainment of their objective.    &quot;The committee express condemnation of the ruthless policy  being pursued by theBritish Imperialism in Palestine, which must lead to grave consequences,  and the com-mittee reiterate the opinion that the issue  of  the  future Government of  Palestine shouldbe left to be decided on  the principle of  self-determination.    &quot;While  sympathizing  with the  plight of. the Jews in Europe  and elsewhere,   thecommittee deplore that in Palestine the Jews have relied on British armed forces to advancetheir special claims and have thus  aligned themselves on the side  of British Imperialism.The committee trust that Arabs and Jews  will endeavour to find a  basis  for direct co-operation with  a view to establishing a freei democratic  State in Palestine with adequate protection to Jewish rights.&quot;
                             APPENDIX  II.Resolutions passed by the  Executive Council of the Muslim League,  and at the  Patna              session of the All-India Muslim  League, December  1938.                                The Executive Council.                                1. STATES AND CONGRESS.    While the All-India Muslim League fully  sympathises  with the  aspirations  of  Statessubjects for their constitutional advance, it deprecates a change of attitude on the part ofthe Congress,  whose main objective in championing the cause of the States&apos; people is onlyto secure  the establishment  in  the  Indian  States  of  an  elective system enabling theirrepresentatives to be returned to  the  Federal Legislature, irrespective of anything else,in the hope that it might get a  majority  in the Federal Legislature.   The Council, there -fore,  views with  grave  apprehensions  the  recent pronouncement of  Mahatma Gandhi,which threatens  the  extinction  of the  Euling Princes and the British Government  withdisastrous  consequences, if  they did not meet the demand of the Congress.                                    2. FEDERATION.    The Muslim League is already opposed  to the Federal scheme embodied in the Gov-ernment of India  Act of 1935, for reasons it has repeatedly made clear,  and it  warns theBritish Government that, if the  methods of coercion and intimidation result in the  BritishGovernment yielding  to the Congress, the  Muslims will  not hesitate  to  resort  to  theextremest measures in their opposition  to such a position  where their  most vital interests would stand to be sacrificed.                                           B.                             The All-India Muslim League.                                     1. FEDERATION.     The All-India Muslim League  reiterates  its view  that  the   scheme  of  federation embodied in the Government of India Act, 1935, is not acceptable, but in view of further developments that  have taken  place  or may  take  place  from  time  to time,  it hereby authorises the President of  the All-India Muslim  League to take  such  steps  and adopt such course as may be  necessary with a view  to explore the  possibility of a suitable alter- native which would completely  safeguard the interests of Mussalmans  and other minorities in (India.                                      2.  INDIAN STATES.     While fully  sympathising  with the  legitimate  aspirations  of the subjects  of  Indian States  for constitutional  advancement and for obtaining redress of their grievances, the Muslim League,  although it is bound by  its present programme and policy to maintain an attitude of non-interference  in the affairs of Indian  States, unequivocally declares that if the  Congress  or  other  Hindu organisations  do  not desist forthwith from the present subversive activities in States,  actuated  by ulterior motives, the League will be forced to take such action as may be  necessary to safeguard  the  legitimate interests of Mussalmans.                                  3. CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE.      That having regard to the atrocities that have been  committed  and that  elementary rights of  the Mussalmans have been trampled  upon  in a systematic manner in Bihar, U. P. and CP., and the Governments  of these provinces have failed to redress and protect even the  elementary  rights of Mussalmans of  these provinces  in  spite  of  all constitutional methods adopted so far by the  Muslims, this  session of the All-India  Muslim League is of opinion^ that therefore the time has now come to authorise the Working Committee of the All-India Muslim League  to decide  and resort to direct action if  and when necessary.                                       4. PALESTINE.      It is the  definite  opinion  of the All-India  Muslim  League&apos; that the  unjust Balfour  declaration and  the cruel methods adopted  thereafter  by  the  British  Government to . suppress the Arabs, are  manifestation^  of  a  decided policy of the  British Government to  keep Palestine as a part  of the British  Empire for ever in the  name of Jews,  strengthen  British Imperialism, frustrate the desire of Arabs to unite and form into a federation, and  also to check unity among Muslim nations and use Palestine as a centre of their  activities  and a  naval and aerial base.  This  object by itself and all atrocities  and cruelties that have  been perpetrated on Palestine Arabs to obtain this object have no parallel in history.   This
session  of the  All-India Muslim League regards those Arabs, who are laying down their lives and sacrificing their all and are being harassed and crushed for the cause of preserving the sanctity of Palestine, to protect their national rights  and free  their country,  as heroesand martyrs, and congratulates them on their courage, sacrifice and perseverance.  It warnsthe British Government that if it does not stop the  influx of Jews into Palestine forthwithand does not include the grand Mufti, the real leader of Arabs,  as well  as representativesof Indian Mussalmans  at the  proposed Conference,  the Conference will prove  a  farce.  Itdeclares that the problem of Palestine is the problem of the Mussalmans  of the world andif the British Government  does not even now do justice to Arabs and fulfil the  demands.of Mussalmans of the  world,  Muslims  of  India will adopt  any  programme  and will  beprepared to make any sacrifice that may be decided upon by a  conference of representativesof all Muslim  nations  in  which Indian  Muslims .will also participate, to  free the Arabs.from  the clutches of  British domination  and  usurpation of Palestine  by  Jews.  this session  also  declares in clear  ternrs  to  the  British Government that if any attempt is.insisted upon to give practical  shape to the  idea  that appears  to be prevalent in some british  and American circles to make  Palestine as the national home  of Jews, it will leadto a state of perpetual  conflict.                                  5.  FRONTIER POLICY.    Whereas the forward policy of the British Government, which in the name of Indiandefence aims at forcible subjugation  of   the independent  tribal  belt   lying   betweenAfghanistan  and North-West Frontier on  the border of  India,  has failed,  with all  its military resources, to  attain  its objective,  and has  resulted only in incalculable yearlyloss of men and money, without any prospect  of coming to a successful end in the near ordistant  future, and whereas the trans-frontier  border tribes, who prefer total extinction tolife servitude, have all  along made it clear that they will  resist to  the bitter end all Britishattempts to  dominate  their homeland, this  session of the All-India  Muslim League  is ofopinion that  the time has now come for the British Government to reconsider its Frontierpolicy  in  a more statesmanlike manner,  based on  the  universally recognised principle ofself-determination.  Further, it condemns the policy  and activities of the  Congress in theN.-W. F. P., whereby  they have given indications that tribal areas, should become parts o the administered territory..
