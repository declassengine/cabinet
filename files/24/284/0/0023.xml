CABINET.SITUATION IN  THE  FAR  EAST.         Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.    I CIRCULATE to my  colleagues a memorandum which has been prepared in the Foreign  Office suggesting certain precautionary steps in view  of the increasing threat from Japanese action and presumed  intentions in regard toBritish vital interests in the Far East.  .  Telegrams giving the views of His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Tokyo on the issues raised in the memorandum are appended.    On such judgment, as I am  in a position to form I  think the conclusions ofthe memorandum are well founded..&apos;;                .                                                      H.    March 30, 1939.                               MEMORANDUM.     Some recent moves by the Japanese must inevitably give rise to a suspicion that they have been undertaken at the instigation of the Germans and Italians,or anyhow in pursuance of some plan concerted with them, and rumours to this effect have already reached the ears of His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Tokyo and:of the  United States Government.  Up  to  now  the evidence which has beenreceived in London has pointed to greater activity on the part of the Italians,than of the Germans, but the diplomatic and consular authorities of both in theFar East are credibly reported to have  received instructions to co-operate ingeneral with the Japanese.     2.  It must be remembered that Japan3s long-term objective is the creationof a self-contained economic bloc which will be impervious to economic pressure by any outside source.  If she succeeds in absorbing China into this bloc,  JapanIwill still  lack a number  of raw materials essential for  self-sufficiency, notablymineral oils and high-grade iron ore.  The  nearest sources  of  supply of these commodities are in Borneo and Malaya,  and the acquisition of these places wouldlogically seem to,be one of the next stages in the creation of the projected  bloc.:Tn matters of real importance the Japanese are rarely in a hurry, and generallyact  on the principle of taking what&apos; they can  to-day in  the certainty  thatto-morrow they will  get a little nearer the  ultimate goal.  It rather looks as though they had made up their minds that what can be taken  at little risk to-dayare various advanced posts on the way to the long-term objective.  Hainan, which,&apos;they occupied on the  10th February, is obviously of immediate tactical value fora campaign along the Sino-Indo-China border, and would always be useful for.$he  control of the  Gulf of -Tongking.   The  Paracel Islands (250 miles  east ofTourane in Annam), which  they are rumoured to be about  to occupy,: and the       10333  [18878]                                               B
Spratley Group (about 500 miles E. of the&apos;souther&amp;most point of Indo-China,375 miles W. of North Borneo and the  south-west corner of the Philippines and750 miles from Singapore), which they  are known to  intend to annex, may be of little absolute utility, but have considerable possibilities as advanced observationposts and as refuelling stations for hydroplanes and submarines.     3.  Hainan is the subject of an assurance given by China to France in 1897that she had  no intention of ceding the island to any third Power (Hertslet,Vol. 2, page 1148).  The Paracel Islands are claimed by France, as against China,in virtue of their alleged attachment  to the Empire of Annam some hundred years ago.  The Spratley Group form part of  a vast aggregation of small islands and  reefs annexed by decree by France  in 1933.  The Japanese Government, whohave  for some years encouraged  the settlement of the archipelago  by Japanesefishermen and have supplied them with wireless apparatus, have always taken theline  in  their voluminous official  correspondence with  the French (which is stillgoing on) that they cannot admit the French claim and must regard the SpratleyGroup as res  nullius.  No formal notification of  Japanese  annexation has beenmade to the French or to the world at  large, principally, it is  believed, becausethe Japanese  Government fear that this would play into the hands of  the BigNavy Party in the  United  States  and render move probable  the fortificationof Guam.    4.  The Japanese Government had some  idea a few weeks  ago of notifyingthe  Germans  and  Italians  of  their decision to annex.   The  receipt of this communication may have suggested to  the European partners  that they might turn  to their&apos;  own  advantage . Japan&apos;s  disposition   to insinuate  herself intoimportant  positions  in  these seas, and they  may well have  encouraged her toproceed, to. the occupation of Other  places claimed by or of  interest  to France.Be this as.it may, so far it has been the position and prestige of France thathas been principally threatened by recent Japanese actions in these waters. Verypossibly Germany and Italy expect that a point will shortly be reached at whichthe French will feel that further passive acquiscence in this nibbling  at  their territory by the Japanese will be so damaging, to  French prestige that they Willbe impelled to  send naval reinforcements to the. Far East,  and will induce HisMajesty&apos;s Government to do  likewise on the score  of community of interest.  Byway of further incentive to France and Great Britain  to move part of  theirfleets eastwards, the  Japanese, in accordance with  the presumed  plan, are to erect permanent works on  Hainan,* in  the  neighbourhood  of Macao,  and atWhampoa, outside Canton,  to intensify pressure on the Shanghai  MunicipalCouncil and on French and. British interests in  Central China, to squeeze outthe French and British Concessions at Tientsin (where the Italian Consul-general has recently received instructions to refrain from further collaboration with hisFrench,  British and  United States colleagues  in opposing  the Japanese)  and generally to take whatever action they  regard as best calculated to  humiliate usboth.  In short, Japan  is to do anything in her power to goad the French aridBritish into an attempt to  protect the remnants of  their prestige in  the far east.  The Japanese are presumably prepared to fall in with  this scheme, partly because up to  a point  it can be made to fit into their  long-term plans,  andprincipally because they are confident that, once France and  Great Britain had sent their ships on the long 42-days&apos; journey to the Far East,  Germany and italy would strike in Europe.                      -     5.  On the assumption  that, at this particular  moment, the despatch of afleet to the Far East is very difficult unless there was a  direct Japanese attackon  British  or  French possessions, it is  necessary to look for  other means of^countering Japan&apos;s moves.  Such means do exist, for we could,  if we so decided,apply the financial and economic pressure of which  we know  Japan stands somuch in dread. At the moment  she appears  to think that, because the  rumours of joint Anglo-American economic action which  circulated so freely a few monthsback have not been substantiated, the  British  and United States  governments must have decided against recourse to  this form of pressure.  So they have-atleast temporarily.   But hitherto retaliation of  this sort  has been  consideredprincipally from the point of view of its utility  and efficacy as a means of saving    * A recent report speaks of machinery for a powerful wireless station being sent thitherand of the transfer of administrative officials from Formosa.                       :;!..&apos;(.;..&apos;
the position in. China.  If, however, the plans of Germany, Italy and Japan are as might  be  inferred from the  preceding  paragraph, it  is not now a question of protecting local vested interests, but of safeguarding our whole world position.  .  6.  When the question of economic reprisals was last considered, the general conclusion was reached that their institution involved a risk that Japan&apos;s counter-measures might lead to war.  Of course, this risk cannot be absolutely ruled  out,but how much real substance it has is  worth careful  examination.  In Japan&apos;scheme of things the final reduction of China and her early economic exploitationis the task allotted to to-day, and  she is unlikely to allow herself to be deflectedfrom this to embark on adventures scheduled in her programme for,  say, 1950,unless  she is absolutely convinced that no serious risk attaches to such an upset toher time-table. Her present  plan,  so  far as China is concerned, would appear tobe to refrain from any further large-scale campaign (with the possible exceptionof operations along the Indo-China border to cut the Yunnan railway and upthe Canton-Hankow railway), to  hold  for an indefinite number of years withgarrisons  of moderate size various areas within which to  exploit  the fruits ofconquest, thus helping to pay  for the occupation, and to meet any Chinese strategicmovements by swift counter-strokes, involving the use of mechanised columns  and large quantities of aeroplanes for reconnaissance and bombing.  To carry this outsuccessfully, enormous quantities of oil and petrol will be required.  Any alter-native plan would entail the maintenance  in the field of even more men and alarge number will be needed even for the light garrison scheme.  A fair number of japanese  ships must be required for an indefinite period to blockade the 2,500 oddmiles of the coast of China, even though there be no Chinese fleet, and a  certainnumber more must be needed for transport and lines of communication work.    7.  No doubt  the larger warships of the Imperial Navy have seen little seaservice since the war began, but these  are not much use unless  accompanied bytheir proper complement of auxiliary ships, of which it is difficult to believe  thatafter  nearly two years of  war many do not  now stand  in  need of scraping orrepairs.  If, indeed, Japan  found her supplies of oil, iron, nickel and so on,suddenly  and completely cut off, it is at least questionable whether she would beable to prosecute her war on a restricted  sc&amp;le in China, let alone engage  in along-range naval campaign against, say, Camranh or Singapore. Not only that.but the reduction of those places would not ease her position, for she would  still have to seize and get working the East Indian oil-fields, an operation which would necessarily  take considerable tirne.    8.  And quite apart from all this, there would be the ever-present  fear of attack by the Soviet Union, and the uncertainty as to whether the United states could really be relied upon to remain  a passive spectator until intervention would come   too late to be  effective.  Germany and Italy could by no  stretch ofimagination supply Japan with the raw materials access to which had been putoff, even if  they did declare  war and strike  in the West.  Indeed, the. Japanesemust  recognise that, as things are  at present,  it  would  not be  an  altogetherunmixed blessing  for  them if  Great Britain became  involved in war with anythird Power, for,  if she did, many of Japan&apos;s vital sources of supply would be automatically imperilled.    9.  With all  this  to deter her,  it is  difficult to  believe that  Japan wouldactually have recourse to war, were economic pressure to be applied.  She would undoubtedly make many threatening gestures and might cause  a  great  deal of serious damage to British trade, but it is extremely doubtful if she would or could go further&apos;  than this.   In recent times a tendency has been apparent  to believethat the  volcanic  temperament of the Japanese will explode on the slightestprovocation.  There is, however, nothing in Japanese history to support such atheory. The Japanese  are extremely calculating in their policies and, if  it paysthem to appear volcanic and  about to explode at any moment, they will play upon that as much as they can; in fact, they have done so with  considerable success.Those  with long experience, of Japan and the Japanese are convinced that  theywould only  resort to drastic action against the British Empire if they thought itwould pay  in the  long run  (and that is a consideration which  must always beborne  in mind).  If His Majesty&apos;s Government make it clear that in protectingtheir interests they are prepared at any moment to abandon their course of actionwhen those interests no longer require protection; if it is made clear that Japan&apos;s       [18878]                                                     B 2
 ruin  is. not the aim, and  if the door  is left carefully, and obviously open for friendly negotiations, then Japan  would scarcely: be likely to resort to drastic action solely on the grounds of the action that  we had taken,  v .    10,. Hitherto;  acquiescence,  except for diplomatic protests;  in  Japanese inrbads on our property and interests, has merely encouraged further depredation; The immediate aim of Japan is undoubtedly the exclusion of all other foreigners froiii the  Chinese market, as  has already happened in  Manchukuo.  If she succeeds.in this, she will obviously be in a far stronger position to proceed to what is probably the next stage in her programme, the acquisition of control over the oil and iron-bearing territories in Borneo and Malaya.  Her economic bloc would then be to  all intents and purposes complete, and she would present for all time, either in combination with Germany and Italy or even alone, a permanent and formidable threat to British interests throughout the Eastern hemisphere.  It is not, therefore, a question merely  of devising measures which would have direct or immediate effect in inducing Japan to pay greater regard to British interests in China.  What  is necessary  is the consideration from the broadest  aspect of vital Imperial needs of what could  most effectively be done,  and at what moment, permanently to defend  British interests  in the Far  East against the  threat inherent in Japan&apos;s plans  for the setting up of what she calls &quot; a new order in East  Asia.&quot;  It is not  suggested  that we  should proceed at once to positive measures of retaliation, but we  should certainly lose no further  time in preparing ourselves against the day when positive action may be  necessary.  &apos;  11:  During the last three months Sir R. Craigie has  frequently expressed the view  that the mere  threat to denounce the Anglo-Japanese  Commercial Convention of 1911  (which incidentally  is generally recognised as being to some extent out of date), coupled possibly  with overt signs of  preparation to  exert financial and economic pressure, might be expected to have a  markedly restraining influence on Japan.  He has also urged very forcefully that action in this sense must be taken at once before Japan has time to  derive any economic benefit from her China  adventure.  While it is too early to  take  any definite view  as  to the opportuneness of resorting to any  form of  overt financial or economic pressure, all the necessary preparation should be made at once  in case it is decided at any time to proceed to such measures.    12.  The present time appears to be specially critical in the Far East  in the light  of what the  Japanese are doing in North  China and  in  the islands  in the South China Seas/  Like their  British associates, the United States and French commercial communities in North China have been strongly  urging their Govern- ments to institute  economic reprisals of  some sort.  The Governments of France, the Netherlands and  Australia naturally  share  our alarm  at the  japanese occupation of Hainan and other islands.  The  Government of India too,  when they reflect on the ugly possibility of seeing the Japanese establish themselves on the coast of the Bay of Bengal, may  well feel more disposed than hitherto to run  the  risk of a  certain  amount  of temporary economic  dislocation,  more especially if it were possible to  represent to them that the measures in which they were  invited to collaborate had as their main  object the  deterrence of treaty- breaking and international gangsterism. The prospect therefore of obtaining the necessary  co-operation of  other interested States is  not  too slender to make it worth our  while to  invite their assistance.  The attitude of the United  States Government in regard to denunciation is shown  in Washington telegram No. 445, of which a copy is annexed.    13.  In the circumstances it is recommended that:     (1) His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom should address com- munications to the Governments of the.Dominions, India, Burma and the United States of America-                                                    /;;:;    (a) informing them that, unless they see very grave objection, His Majesty&apos;s           Government in the  United Kingdom propose, in order to free their           hands,  to decide in  principle to  denounce the Anglo-Japanese  Com-           mercial Treaty  (Canada and Eire are still parties to it), reserving their           decision as to the actual date of giving the twelve  months&apos; notice of           denunciation;   -  &quot;&apos;
 -.   (b)  inviting those Governments which have separate agreements with Japan          themselves to consider,,.denouncing their treaties  (the United States          Treaty is subject, to denunciation at six months&apos; notice);    (c)  suggesting that all these Governments, together with those of France and :.   : ,    - **he.  Netherlands, should  proceed  at  once  to an  exchange of views          regarding possible means: of  applying  pressure  to  Japan with         : particular reference to limiting her access  to free exchange by means          of clearing systems,  increased colonial duties on Japanese imports,          lower  quotas, &amp;o;    (d)  stating that His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom intend          for  their part to seek at an early  date such Parliamentary powers as          may be necessary to give immediate effect to any retaliatory measures          that may be agreed on in the future;  and    (e)  expressing  the hope that the mere threat of denunciation, coupled with          overt signs of  views, being exchanged and general preparatory work          being  undertaken, may of themselves  prove to be a sufficient deterrent          to Japan, and thereby afford Germany and Italy disquieting evidence          of the fragile character of the help they may look to from their Far          Eastern associate.    (2)  The A.T.B. Committee should be instructed to advise as to possible meansnow of bringing effective pressure to bear on  Japan, and the extent to which theco-operation of other Governments is indispensable, with particular reference tothe efficacy of instituting a clearing system in  the United Kingdom and restrictingJapanese imports  into British Colonies by reducing  quotas and imposingadditional duties.Foreign Office,    March 18, 1939.ANNEX  I.        Sir R. Lindsay to Viscount Halifax. (Received December 2.)(No. 445.)(Telegraphic.)                               Washington, December 1, 1938.    MY telegram No. 439, paragraph 2.    Again, to-day, Acting Secretary of State reverted to development of Japanesepolicy in the Far East and  to increasing need for Governments  whose interests were threatened to concert economic action in their  defence.  He indicated that state Department would be receptive if, within a few  weeks, they could learnany conclusions His  Majesty&apos;s  Government might have reached.    I said that the matter had been considered in London, and so far as I knewdefinite conclusions had not been reached. What seemed to transpire was (1) thatno action by any single Government alone would be of any use, and (2) that minorpin-pricks would only irritate  without seriously hurting Japanese Government.Nothing short of  denouncing commercial treaty would  hurt, and. it was quite a question whether that action might not hurt us more than Japan!    His reply to this was that United States treaty was, he believed, open todenunciation at six  months&apos; notice.   United States  cotton interests, which  were already in parlous condition, would.be seriously affected, but, on  the other hand,Japan would suffer  greatly  from the loss of the silk market.   Inference to bedrawn from his language was that in the procedure under contemplation of coursewe must suffer, but that it might nevertheless be worth considering whether theloss ought not to be  faced.

WASHINGTON telegram No. 445.     Provisional conclusion reached by His Majesty&apos;s  Government, as indicated to  Acting  Secretary  of State, may  appear  to United States  Governmentsomewhat  discouraging.  Our  views on  this subject have  been stated fully in  my  despatch No.  880 of  4th Noverriber, : and,  while admitting  that  wedo not possess all necessary data here, we consider economic effect of denunciation-tion on  Japan  would in present  conditions  be  far  more  serious  than uponGreat Britain, and even  more serious if  Dominions were to make  common causewith us.  If United States Government were also to proceed to denunciation (thusincidentally exercising considerable pull on Dominions), effect on Japan would beoverwhelming.  As regards political risks, these would admittedly be great in  theevent of action by Great Britain alone but negligible in the event of parallel action by British Empire and United States of America.                       :.&apos;     If United States Government are really in a receptive mood, I trust every opportunity will be taken to convince them of need for parallel action at the earliestpossible moment in order to bring It home to. Japan in time that her new Chinapolicy will not pay.     Please repeat to Washington.                                         .     (Repeated to Shanghai, No. 1184.)ANNEX III.         Sir R. Craigie to Viscount Hcdifax.-(Received January 28.)(No. 84.  Very Confidential.)(Telegraphic.)1&apos;    -&apos;&apos;&apos;                              Tokyo, January 27, 1939.    YOUR telegram No. 35 to Washington.    1...  In your instructions tovSir R. Lindsay your Lordship appears to. refer to protection of specific trade interests in China as principal object of counter-measures.  As pointed out  in recent telegrams,&apos; however, I feel the main issue isnow far  wider and far more important, since what is at stake is  not only our commercial investment in China, but the whole political and economic future  of countries with interests in the Pacific, to say nothing of the urgency of ensuring the observance of treaty obligations as  a matter of principle.  If  what we arestriving for is to uphold a  principle and avert a future danger, we-are justifiedin taking greater risks in terms of short-run disadvantage than if our aim were merely to preserve existing interests intact.                            .    Question at issue seems to me to be prevention of complete establishment  ofa totalitarian Power in  East Asia with aims similar to  those of Germany andItaly, which is already on  the way to. becoming  a  menace to all countries withinterests in East Asia and the Pacific.  By supplying Japan with all that she hasneeded in the past the British Empire and United  States have already, gone fartowards  building up this menace, and  if they continue  from now oil to allowJapan to obtain what she wants,-they will soon have completed the process.    2.  I therefore  submit that in presenting the situation to United StatesGovernment we should emphasise these wider grounds of action not only becausethey are  likely to carry more weight in America, hut also because Japanese thinkthat,  though they might make a deal with us on  a  question of interests, theycannot reach a compromise with the United States on a question  of  principle,and would accordingly,  if we took a stand  on  principle jointly  with UnitedStates, see no hope of driving a wedge between us.
9 J *3f6 &apos;i vJ    If any change in British and American attitude is to  be effective it shouldbe made quickly, and the most effective change would be to begin at once to reducepurchases of Japanese merchandise  and gold.   I  and my advisers regard thepresent time as opportune  for more resolute action.   With steady increase in japan&apos;s imports from China, and Manchukuo and possible temporary  easing of tension with Russia, we cannot feel sure that in  a few months the situation willnot have become less favourable from our point of  view.  I have  good reason tobelieve that recent damping-down here of fishery dispute with Soviet Russia is notunconnected with firmer attitude of Great Britain and the United States.    3.  As  to  conclusions reached by His  Majesty&apos;s  Government in November1937, I do not think all of them now hold good as regards (b) of paragraph 3 inyour telegram under  reference,  and  I am of opinion that  even without a stateof  war and even if  entrepot  trade were permitted  (which  would  be  most fortunate), Japan could not acquire from alternative sources sufficient suppliesof some essential materials  such as  oil, cotton, aluminium,  tin,  zinc, nickel andrubber. But I do not understand why entrepot trade, even if not stopped entirely,could not be so diminished as  to have a  paralysing effect in respect of suchmaterials, especially where  they can be controlled at the source of supply.    In (c) it is stated, with regard to an embargo on Japan&apos;s export trade, thatno decisive effect could be expected for a considerable period; but this neglects the strong probability that anticipation by Japan of increasing pressure  on her would cause her to moderate her policy long before the pressure reached its  maximumeffect.  This consideration applies to any single  form of  pressure and  a fortiorito a group of various forms of pressure in combination.  I have never supposedthat any single counter-measure would, before becoming fully operative, have animmediately disastrous effect on Japan&apos;s economy, but I do consider application ofa widespread embargo on Japan&apos;s exports would set  in motion a  process thatwould rapidly  prove disastrous.    Point (d). The effect  on Japanese shipping would be far  greater than theeffect of Japanese retaliation on British and United States shipping. We submit that while refusal of facilities to Japanese shipping in  all British and UnitedStates ports would be  seriously disastrous  to Japanese  shipping operations inmost parts of the world, and, consequently, with Japanese world trade, retaliationin kind by Japan would affect operation of British shipping only  in  Japanese-controlled waters.    Point (e). Participation of countries  indicated wrould prevent Japan fromacquiring necessary amounts of raw  materials (see also paragraph 3 above).  Asregards (/),  Canada  is  also concerned because  of her metal exports  to Japan.Without endangering her own economy and her  continental policy,  Japan  is not now in a position to retaliate by making any further considerable reduction in her imports from British [  ? group omitted], in  any case, our object in stoppingJapan&apos;s exports would be to prevent Japan from financing  her essential imports.     Paragraph 9. An element of risk is, of course, inseparable from any actionof this kind, but my considered opinion is that risk of war  is slight  if the matter is properly handled.   Such risk as there  is arises from  possible  irresponsibleaction by younger officers and  reactionary  elements rather  than  from anydeliberate act  of Japanese Government   and  themselves  (e.g.,  by  ill-timedpublicity).   Present  Japanese  policy  is based on the assumption,  to whichthey  still hold,  that  in  no circumstances will  Great  Britain  and UnitedStates be able to take joint or  parallel action  in  this matter.   If such action should finally be decided upon, the problem will  be to convince Japanese Govern-ment without  making overt or public threats.  Everything in my mind would depend on  whether such conviction could be carried  in time to  the Japaneseofficial and particularly the military mind.  With situation  such as it is, the saving of &quot;face&quot; is an all important  factor.   Subject to above comments,  entirely agree with your Lordship&apos;s view that a policy of counter-measures shouldnot be embarked  on  unless we are prepared in the last resort to pursue it tothe end.
