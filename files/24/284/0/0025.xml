Appreciation  of  the  Political Situation,  by the    Government of India, dated 18th March, 1939.    Circulated for the information of the Cabinet by    the Secretary of State  for India.
Confidential appreciation of the Political situationin India, dated the 18th March 1939,  issued on theauthority of the Secretary of State for India.      Mr.  Gandhi  and  Ra.jkot  -  At  the  time when  the last Appreciation  was written Gandhi had offered  to  leave the Congress  field to Subhad Bose and his followers, and was himself sharpening the edge of agitation against the States. It was expected  that he would so  manage the  campaign against the States as to recover  the ground  temporarily lost  by the Congress right wing in British India: but no one foresaw the sensational course which  he  followed.      It was mentioned in the last Appreciation  that the settlement, reached  on Christmas  Day between Vallabhai Patel and the  Ruler  of Rajkot State, had broken down. Gandhi, attributing  this to a breach of faith on the Ruler&apos;s part  and  professing mental agony also over tales of repression,  suddenly descended on the State  on a &quot;mission  of peace.&apos;!  He was given every facility by the State authorities  for the investigation of alleged atrocities.  A few days later he wrote peremptorily to the Ruler requiring  compliance with six demands within 24 hours, failing  which he would fast till the Ruler- gave  in.  The  Ruler  rejected the ultimatum,   and Gandhi thereupon began his  &quot;fast unto death&quot; on March 3rd.      The  demands related for the most part to the constitution of the  Reforms Committee which was to havebeen  appointed under the settlement with Vallabhai Patel. The fast  ended on  March 7th as the result of the Viceroy&apos;s intervention:   with the consent of the Ruler  the Viceroyundertook to consult the Chief Justice of India as to the construction to be placed on the Ruler&apos;s notification ofDecember  26th  as amplified by a subsequent letter addressed by the Ruler to Vallabhai Patel:   the committee would be
set up in accordance with the decision of the Chief justice and the same authority would decide any differencearising  between the members of the committee as to themeaning of any part of the notification.     During the four days of the fast, surprise (inmany quarters tinged with disapproval) at Gandhi1sventure had given place to anxiety which threatenedhere and there to become hysterical.   At his age andin his feeble state of health it was supposed that hecould not long survive:  his death would have producedresults which, incalculable in various ways, would doubtless have included the&quot; resignation of the congress ministries.   The Viceroy&apos;s successful intervention was therefore greeted generally with relief, moreespecially as the terms of the arrangement restrictedthe issue to the circumstances of a particular controversy in one State,  and have not advanced the campaign againstthe States in general.     Since the breaking of the fast the Viceroy hasaccorded interviews to Genohi on March 15th and loth.     2.   The Tripuri Session - Gandhi&apos; s tactical ingenuityis as much admired as his  more spiritual quality:  andit has not escaped notice  that the limelight concentrated on Rajkot left Bose and the Congress  field for a while in the shade;  or that when with the breaking of the fast attention turned to Tripuri p /( the village in theCentral Provinces selected for the annual session ofthe All-India Congress Committee) Gandhi&apos;s followers,deprived of his presence but strong in the emotionaladvantage won by the Rajkot interlude,  were found to besubduing with determination and success, the revoltingwing of the Congress party.-
                                                  ft Ti A                                                  6 tl J      Few people believed that Bose would be allowed to enjoy the fruits of the victory won in the presidential election.   On February 23nd the Congress Working  Committee ceased to  exist:   twelve of the fifteen members announced their resignation in a joint letter which invited the President  to choose his own Cabinet and follow his  own policy;  at the sime time Jawaharlal Nehru in a long statement  strongly attacked Subhas Bose for the false insinuations made by him against his colleagues and for  other  failings.      The Tripuri  meetings began on March 7th.  Bose  was ill  and  attended  against doctors&apos;  orders:   his arrival in an ambulance and his appearance at the meetings on a  stretcher1  failed to  appease the powerful section which was  determined to humiliate him.   The main resolution on Congress  policy moved by  Pandit  Pant,  the United Provinces  Premier,  was carried in the Subjects Committee  by 213  votes  to 135 and in the open  session without  amendment  and without a division,  though  in  the face  of  prolonged  disorder  caused by Bose&apos;s  followers. This  resolution affirmed adherence  to Gandhi&apos;s policies and programme:  expressed confidence  in  the  work  of  the &apos; defunct  Working Committee,  and  deplored  the  aspersions cast  against  the members  of  it:   and  requested the President  to  select  the  new Working  Committee  in  accordancewith  the wishes of  the Mahatma.   In Gandhi&apos;s absenceJawaharlal Nehru dominated the  session:  his weightthrown into  the scale against 3ose  assured  the defeat of the revolt, especially as  to the various factions ofthe left wing failed to  close their ranks.  A resolutionauthorising  the All-India Congress Committee and theWorking Committee to take all steps  that may be necessaryto cure corruption in the Congress organisation is likelyto be implemented  to the further discomfiture of the
rebels.  Thus at the moment Bose, sick in body,has also suffered a grievous fall in repute; and the .;andriiansection appears to he in a position to restore the equilibrium of the party, with no great diminution inits own control of the High Command.     Other resolutions passed at Tripuri attracted lessattention than those dealing:with the internal affairs of the party.  The &quot;nation;::! demand&apos;&apos; was stated in aresolution moved by Jawaharlal Nehru, which in somewhatfamiliar terms decried provincial autonomy, repudiatedthe Federal scheme, and claimed the framing of a freeconstitution by means of a Constituent Assembly.  Theresolution does not contain the elements which had beenadvertised as essential to the policy of Bose and the leftwing -viz. an ultimatum requiring the compliance of theBritish Government within a period of months, and a specificthreat of civil disobedience if this were not conceded.Other resolutions dealt with Indians overseas,  british foreign policy, the Palestine situation, the administrationof Baluchistan, the Egyptian delegation, and the war inChina:  while the resolution on the Indian States affirmedthe possibility of Congress relaxing the restraint it hasimposed on itself and authorised the Working Committee toissue instructions from time to time in order that theCongress may be increasingly identified with the peopleof the States.     3.  Communal Trouble - It is possible to exaggerate theimportance of the incidents above mentioned.  The Congressis not the nation:   and even the fate of Gandhi is nota matter of great concern to some sections of the community,including most Muslims-.  A problem which Congress, either as a party or in its operation through Ministries, hasmade no progress in solving, and which appears in fact tobecome more intractable, is the present state of communal
                                                5,    fC 3 wfeeling.  Religious  and communal differences, which led todisorder  in various  places in January and February, producedvery  acute tension at the beginning of March when the celebration of Muharram and of the Hindu festival of Holialmost  coincided.  In many areas violence was preventedonly  by strigent precatitions.  Of a number of riots themost  serious were in the United Provinces - for instance in Cawnpore where a fresh outburst of disorder resultedin 8  persons being killed, and in Benares where over40 persons were killed and 200 injured.  The strain onthe magistracy and the police has been very great, andin a  number of cities the presence of British troopshas given valuable security.      4.  All the Provincial Governments have now presentedtheir budgets.  The devices for raising new revenue in bengal  and Bombay were mentioned in the last Appreciation.In most of the Provinces taxes on the sale of motor spirit and lubricants are being imposed.  In the United Provincesa proposal to impose a graded tax on persons in employmentreceiving an annual income of Es. 2,500 or more has excitedcriticism on the ground that it invades the Central field.In this Province as well as elsewhere the leyy of freshtaxation is necessitated by the lavish abandonment of income  through the spread of prohibition.  The united provinces proposal will admittedly affect government servants with particular severity:  and in other CongressProvinces (Bombay and Madras) the Ministry have intimatedtheir desire that the loss on prohibition shall be met by a&apos;cut in the pay of the Services.     5.  In Sind a sixth Minister has.now been appointed.-Sir Ghulam Kassain Hidayatullah,  who was Premier in theMinistry which fell in March of last year.  Elsewhereprovincial affairs call for little remark.  In Madras
labour has been giving  serious trouble in various places.      6.  The death of His Excellency Lord 3rabourne in Calcutta on February 23rd was received with a remarkabledemonstration of mourning throughout the country, andparticularly in the Provinces of Bombay and Bengal wherethe Ministers were among the first to pay tribute to theeminent services rendered by him as Governor and to his great personal popularity.      7.  In the Central Legislature the budget shows a deficit on the current year (chiefly due to decrease inCustoms receipts) of Es. 265 lakhs, which thus absorbs thegreater part of the original provision of 300 lakhs for reduction of debt:  a deficit of Rs. 50 lakhs in thecoming year will he met &quot;by doubling the import duty onraw cotton:  and taxes on the higher grades of incomewill be considerably increased.     8.  Vfcziristan -  There has been much sniping of troopsin North Waziristan, especially in the Khaisora Valley,but no real opposition.  Stvtr weather has impededmilitary operations.  Several attacks have been made bytribesmen on Datta Kht-1 post by night:  two guns of localmanufacture have been used in support of these attacks.No serious damage has been suffered.  Aircraft havetaken successful action by night against the enemy andthe attacks have ceased since one of the guns blew up and killed a prominent hostile leader and three of hisfollowing.   It has,  however,  been found necessary to institute extensive air operations against the Madda KhelWazirs, who were chiefly responsible for these attacks,and who have been harbouring the Faqir of Ipi for the last few months.  The Faqir is now believed to be just acrossthe Durand Line in Afghanistan.   Raids in the settleddistricts have been fewer and less successful than in
last month.  In one case two raiders were killed and onewounded and in another a gang of 20 were repulsed &quot;by theinhabitants of the village which they raided, and returnedempt y-hand ed.
