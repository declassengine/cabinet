PALESTINE              THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES apologisedCOMMITTEE                for  not circulating any document  to the Committee.  Therhe LondonConferences     situation changed from day to day and had he circulatedConstitutional  a document two  or three days &quot;before it would now haveProposals.                &quot;been out of  date.                       As regards the  joint meeting of Arabs and Jews                the  difficulty  of the  disclosure in &quot;Tne Times&quot; had been                got  over and that morning a meeting &quot;between representa-                tives of the Arab States  and certain Jewish representatives                had  taken place.   At this meeting British representatives                had  also &quot;been presents  The proceedings had opened                favourably but  at a 1 ater stage the discussion had become                very controversial and the meeting  had  been adjourned  until                the  following daye  In order that the second meeting should                take place in a favourable atmosphere the British                representatives had offered to bring forward certain                tentative suggestions  on  the constitutional question as                a basis for  discussion,,   It was with regard to these                suggestions  that  he,, the  Secretary of State, wished to                have the assistance of the Cabinet Committees                       From  the time when the London Conferences first                opened all the  Arab representatives had consistently                pressed for  the establishment of an independent  Arab                State in Palestine  At the meeting that morning the                representatives of the Arab States had very strongly                urged that the  British Government should declare that                their objective was the establishment of an independent                Arab State,by which was meant a State in which the Arabs                would be in  a majority and the Jews in a minority.  With                regard to constitutional  development the Arab representa-                tives had in previous discussions advocated the
adoption of the Iraq., model but that morning Aly MaherPasha,the principal Egyptian Delegate,who had taken the lead in the discussion had proved helpful and it seemed likely that he would be able to exercise a useful and moderating influence,,  It might, with his assistance, be found possible to move from the Iraq.model to something more like the Egyptian model of procedure.       When the Arab representatives had based their proposals on the Iraq model, they had suggested theestablishment in Palestine of a provisional government under the British High Commissioner, the members of whichwould be Arab and Jew in the proportion of two Arabsto one Jewa  This provisional government would startunder the existing Mandate and the precedent  wouldclosely follow the Iraq, precedent   and would end afterthe disappearance of the Mandate .with an independentgovernment under Palestinian Ministers with some sort                                         with  Palestineof electorerlparliamentary institutions and /in closetreaty relations with this country,       As  the Home Secretary had observed at the meetingof the Cabinet on the previous day (Cabinet 8(39), page 15)the arrangements had not  worked satisfactorily in Iraq,and there seemed every likelihood that they would workmuch less satisfactorily in Palestine.because Palestinediffered from Iraq in the  very important respect that whereas Iraq had a more or less homogeneous arab population, the population of Palestine comprised alarge and vigorous non--Arab element,,
                                                      A J?                                                      ID     There were, moreover, other grave difficulties in theproposal that the Iraq model should he followed.    In thefirst place it was clear that a Ministry composed of arab and Jewish Ministers would not work together as a teamso long as the present strained relations between arabs and Jews continued.    In present circumstances, andprobably for a considerable time ahead, it could not beanticipated that an Arab-Jewish Ministry would be able to function satisfactorily and efficiently if, indeed, itcould function at allo   Secondly, in the existingPalestinian Administration each Department dealt fairly andimpartially with the interests of the Arabs and Jews in thematters, e.g. public health, agriculture, etc,, with whichthe Department was concernedc   If, however, Arab or JewishMinisters were placed in charge of the Departments itwould be taking a very optimistic view to expect thatthose Ministers would, in present circumstances and perhaps for some time to come be free from continual charges which might be justified., that they were not exercising their responsibilities impartially as between the two races.     The High Commissioner was strongly opposed to any suggestion that the Iraq model should be adopted as, inhis view, such action would merely result in anarchy inthe Administration and increased friction between the tworaces in Palestine,     There was also another  consideration to be borne in&apos;mind.   While there were  large differences of opinion inthis country as to how the Palestinian problem should be solved, everyone&apos; was  agreed  that we must continue toprovide the effective government of the  country.    Publicopinion here would regard the  setting up of a provisionalGovernment of the kind suggested as the first  step  in thedirection of a  complete  surrender  of  our duties and responsibility-responibilities in Palestine.

     He had discussed the matter with Lord Halifax and uiv.Butler, whose views,he thought,generally  coincided with his   andown,/he would like to have authority to put forward,  not as a definite conclusion hut as suggestions for consideration, the following tentative proposals.;-     (l).   That the British Government should make a         formal public Declaration that in our view the         Balfour Declaration did not mean the establishment         of a Jewish State in Palestine, and that the         British Government had no intention of establish-         ing a Jewish State in Palestine.     (2)    That we should also declare-that we favoured         the establishment of an independent Palestinian         State when the conditions were, in our view,         ripe for the establishment of such a State.         It would be our intention that the establishment         of an independent Palestinian State should         synchronise with the disappearance Qf the Mandate         and that the future relations between Palestine         and Great Britain, should ? e regulated by a Treaty.     (3)    That we should further   declare that * if a         settlement resulted from the London Conferences *or         when peace was re-established/in Palestine,         we would appoint an authoritative Body to  examine         and report  &amp;s to the constitution of the  inde-         pendent Palestinian State and  on the provisions         to be incorporated in the Treaty regulating the         future relations between Palestine and this         country..   The Body in question would have an                                          Indian         imposing character similar to  the/Round  Table         Conference and would consist of British, Arab and
                                            1 %                                            A. OJewish Representatives.  The British Represent-atives might comprise Representatives of theGovernment and of the Opposition Parties.   TheAra.5 and Jewish Representatives should be confin-ed to Representatives of those races from palestine itself.   In this way the difficulty that the Palestinian Arabs would refuse to re-cognise the Jewish Agency would be surmounted*and no harm would be done because some of theablest Jewish Representatives were themselvesPalestinian Jews.  He contemplated that the arab and Jewish representation on this Body would beproportionate to the Arab and Jewish population-of Palestine at the present time.      Although the Arabs and Jews on the body would be drawn from Palestine itself, eachDelegation should be able to call in outsideExperts to assist theme   This provision would &quot;be useful and valuable since it would enable the AralsDelegation to  obtain the assistance  of nen  like AlyMaher Pasha, who had been an active and valuablemember of the Body which had drawn up theEgyptian Constitution  and would be able fromhis knowledge of constitutional matters, ETE.,not only to give valuable help and guidance to                Ithe PalestinianSArabs, but by exercising amoderating influence would be of considerable assistance to the British Delegation on  the Body-.Similarly, the Delegation of the PalestinianJews would be able to  call in outside constitut-ional and other Experts to help them.    The body would meet in London and might, in due course,
     visit Cairo or Jerusalem,    It would, be for     consideration whether it should, be given Terms     of Reference in quite general terms,  such as to     examine and report on the  future Constitution     of Palestine and the  provisions of the  Anglo-     Palestinian Treaty, or it  might be thought     desirable to be more  specific and include in     the Terms of Reference directions covering the     safeguarding of the interests of the different     communities in Palestine,  the protection of the     Holy Places in Palestine,  etc.            Apart,  therefore, from the Declarations     mentioned in (l) and  (2) above, the important     suggestion would be the offer to set up this     Round Table Body,(4)          In addition, as an interim measure, there     would be a proposal to add Palestinian  Arab and     Jewish Representatives to  the two Councils which     at present advised the High Commissioner for     Palestine.    The first of these was the Advisory     Council which might be given a more dignified status     and converted into a  Council of State.    At present     this Body consisted of the 10 head Officials of  the     principal Palestinian Departments.   The proposal     was that there should be added 10 non-officials     (6 Arab and 4 Jewish) which would give  the Council     of State a total membership of 20.   Its functions,     as at present, would  be purely advisory*
                                                     so       The second hody was the Executive Council which     was at present composed of four official members,     these four being themselves heads of Departments     and members of the Advisory Council,  The proposal     was that the official element should, be increased     by one and that there should be added five     Palestinian representatives (3 Arabs and 2 Jews)-.     The Executive Council would, therefore in future     consist of ten members, five official and five     non-official.       The non-official Palestinian representatives on     the Executive Council would, be Ministers without     Portfolio and would havevthe salary, status, etc.     appropriate to their ministerial rankc.  The     Executive Council would have the same adviscry     functions as at present.  Prom this point of view     the position of both councils was much the same.     Both were advisory and while the Advisory Council     was concerned with legislative business the     Executi.ve. Council-..vra^eoncerned..wi-th^-exje-e-ui-Lve    .business.     In reply to an enquiry THE SECRETARY OF STATS FORTI-3E COLONIES said that the British High Ooromissionej1 hadnot, as yet, had any time to express an  opinion on thes^general proposals.   Pie was, however, strongly  opposed  to\;any proposals on  the Iraq model,   One  of  the maindifferences between these proposals and  the  Iraq model  wasthat  in Palestine the  Arab and Jewish &quot;Ministerial&quot; Members
 of the Executive.Council  would be Ministers without Portfolio and would  therefore have no Departmental responsibilities. Under  the  Iraq, model,  on the  other hand, proviam wssrca&amp;e for normal departmental ministerial responsibility.  His proposals  had  the great advantage that a start  could be made with  representative Government without  the necessity for any electoral proceedings.  The British  High Commissioner was definitely  of opinion that  any attempt to  hold elections in Palestine at the present time  and in  the present state of the  country would be disastrous.       THE PRIME MINISTER enquired what was  the difference between the Secretary  of State&apos;s proposals and  the proposals  of fuad Bey  Hamza.       THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR THE COLONIES  said that the Fuad proposals were based  on the full Iraq  model, e. g. Palestinian  Ministers at  the  head  of  departments  straight  away.       THE HOME SECRETARY understood that apart from the Declarations our offer would be Palestinian  representation on  the two Advisory Councils and to have a Round Table Conference.       THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES  agreed that this  was  the position.  The representation on  theAdvisory Councils might &quot;sugar the pill&quot; so  far as the Arabs  were concerned.  They no doubt would  be very disappointed   at not getting their Independent  Palestinian State out  of the discussions of the London Conferences.He  contemplated that our Mandate would continue until the proposed Treaty came into effect.
       THE MINISTER OP HEALTH asked what reason there wasto  think  that the proposed Round Table Conference would reach  any agreement       THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR THE COLONIES thoughtthat the  prospects might not he very bright hut if theLondon Conferences could reach some agreement this might,in  itself, facilitate agreement at the Round table conference,,     .  THE MINISTER OP HEALTH enquired as to the positionof  the immigration question,       THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR THE COLONIES said thata representative of the Arab States had suggested thatimmigration should continue at the present rate for thenext five years0   The difficulty was to know what was to happen at the end of five years.   He, the Secretary ofState,  agreed that a solution of the immigration questionacceptable both to the Arabs and Jews had still to befound.    With regard to the Mufti he hoped the Muftiwould not he a member of the Round Table Conference hutit might be found difficult to exclude him.    The Secretaryof State then briefly indicated the present  position inregard to the question of land transfers,       THE HOME SECRETARY thought that the great meritof the Secretary of state&apos;s proposals was that they wouldtide us over the immediate crisis.
       THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER thought that verymuch would depend on the attitude which the Jev/stook up in regard to the proposals.  He would have thoughtthat the Palestinian constitutional problem was far moredifficult to settle by the method of Round Table Conferencesthan had been the Indian constitutional problem.  InIndia the constitutional question had had a long historybehind it.  All parties were agreed in desiringconstitutional reform and progress but they differed asto scope and method,,  In Palestine, on the other hand, one side had wanted a popular Assembly and the other sideobjected to anything of the kind.  Again one side hadwanted an independent state of a certain character andthe other side had vehemently repudiated any suchsuggestion*       THE HOME SECRETARY observed that we had nothing to lose by gaining time.       THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR INDIA thought that itwould make a very great difference throughout the moslem world if we were able to make a public declaration that our ultimate objective was an Independent PalestineState.  The impression that he had formed from thediscussions was that the Jews were much less rigid in maintaining their extreme demands than were the Arabs.The Jews recognised that in the present state of theworld they were in a weak political position and that inthe long run it was imperative that they must stand in with us.  Por reasons such as these he thought that whenit came to the point the Jews would make the best of abad job.
     THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR THE COLONIES said thatthere was no doubt that the Jews were very apprehensivein &quot;regard to the world Jewish position and that theyhad haa a considerable shock at the London Conference.Up to the present the British Delegation had neverbudged from their original suggestion for ten yearsimmigration plus an Arab veto at the end of the ten years(B of CP. 4 (39)),  While we had made it clear thatwe were not committed to this solution the Jews had been warned that they might in the long run have to acceptsomething of the kind.  There was no doubt that the jews would react badly to the constitutional proposals whichhe had outlined, but they might be able to consolethemselves by the reflection that, while they would start .under the Constitution as a minority, they might hope  so.long as immigration could be maintained ultimately to become a majority,,   Prom this point of view it was of course of importance to them that there should be nohard and fast denial of further immigration after aperiod of years or, what seemed to them much the same thing,arrangements under which the Arabs would at the end of theperiod be able to veto further immigration.       THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS thought that :.both the Arabs and the Jews regarded the immigrationquestion as of  fundamental  importance and both  of  themlinked  this question  closely with  the.  constitutional   .question.   He  had always thought that it v/ould be possibleto reach agreement with the Arabs and Jews on  the immigration to be allowed in the next five or ten years.
The real difficulty was to decide what was to he done atthe end of the period.   The Jews had resolutely refused .to accept any solution which would then place immigrationin the hands of the new Palestinian administration, while on the other hand, the Arabs were intensely suspicious ofany proposals which in effect would deprive them of theright of vetoing further immigration at the end of the periods   He had wondered whether it might be possibleto suggest that after, say, 5 years there might be aRound Table Conference on the question of futureimmigration into Palestine,,  In su-ggesting- this to theArabs we might argue that after five years of Arabparticipation in the Palestinian Government the probabilitywas that if we were convinced of the case on merits weshould be more likely to favour- restriction of immigration than we might otherwise have beeru\\\\;
                                                       n f*     THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER thought it clear thatthe independent Palestine state envisaged under Mr,MacDonald&apos;s plan would sooner or later he a sovereign state.    We should, of course, do our &quot;best for the Jewsby stipulating for various safeguards.   In the end,however, the position in Palestine would be the same asthat in all other sovereign states, i.e. there would beno practical limit to the powers of a majority government,     The Chancellor thought that the above would be the fear in the minds of the Jews,   It would be our part at the Round Table Conference, when framing the newconstitution, to do whatever we could to put it out ofthe power of a majority government to indulge in activelyanti-Jewish measures*     THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR THE COLONIES suggestedthat the real safeguard, though it would not appear on the surface, was that none of the parties concerned wanted tosee the British clear out of Palestine  for many years tocome.&quot;  It would be a safe assumption that the transitional period would be a long one.   Even after that theJews, although a minority, would not be a helpless minority.They would be a large, able and determined block of thepopulation - so large that they could not be oppressed ordowntrodden in any real sense.   It might be taken ascertain that the Jews would do all they could in&apos; the transitional period to encourage large  families, with the definite idea of increasing their percentage of thepopulation.     THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR india pointed out  that, onthe assumption that they could have an  Arab state, the palestinian Arabs themselves had offered to give adequate safeguards for the Jews,   The neighbouring Arab states
could &quot;be relied upon to see to it that the PalestinianArabs were at least as good as their word.   These safeguardswould be permanently enshrined in the treaty between thiscountry and Palestine.     THE HOME SECRETARY was afraid that he was not sooptimistic   None of these paper safeguards would amountto anything once we had withdrawn cur troops from thecountry.   The position in Palestine would never be reallysimilar to that in India.    Quite apart from paper sanctionswe had innumerable real sanctions available on the spot inIndia.   The presence of British troops was only one ofthese..   In Palestine., on the other hand? we were not part and parcel of the life of the country to anything like thesame extent.     Sir Samuel Hoare said that he was not arguing againstthe Colonial Secretary!s plan.   It was a good plan initself, and there was no available alternative.   Theessential thing was that, whatever was contained, in thepaper constitution, we should retain our garrisons inPalestine and keep the rnachirerjr of government in our own hands.   The success of the whole thing would depend onour remaining there..   We should never be able to givePalestine a promise of virtual independence in the longrun, which we had in effect given to India.     He thought that there was a fair prospect of a successful issue to the present Conferences,   TheArab negotiators would tire of the long drawn out contro-versy.   One reason at the back of their minds in favourof coming to terms with us would be their fear of theItalians.     THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR THE COLONIES said that oneconclusion which seemed to emerge from the  discussion was
9 0that our future treaty with Palestine must he a stiff one.It must, for example, he stiffer than our treaty with iraq, if only because we had  more vital defence interestsin Palestine than we had in Iraq.     THE MINISTER OF HEALTH was afraid that this would hevery difficult ground to cover when the Government had todefend their solution in the House of Commons.   Membersof Parliament would ask awkward questions, e.g, &quot;Do youcontemplate that a time will come when Haifa will  not beavailable for the use of the Ro:yal Navy?&quot;     THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES said that the answer to this would certainly be &quot;No&quot;.   We should put itin the treaty that we were going to stay in Haifa.     THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA suggested that in thebusiness of framing the new constitution it would he desirable to bear in mind the precedent of our Treaty with egypt.   It might be a more useful precedent than the IraqTreaty.    The Egyptian Treaty  contained proper provision for the maintenance of British troops in thecountry.     THE SECRETARY OF STATS FOR THE COLONIES said that hecould not  guarantee  that  the ARABS  would accept this solution.   If they refused it, we should have to thinkagain.   It seemed very likely, however, that in that event we should be compelled to bring the Conference to an end,and to impose a unilateral solution, following prettyclosely the lines of his present plan.     The Palestinian Arabs woald then have put themselvesin the wrong, and he did not see how, in such circumstances, they could keep the rebellion going.     In reply to a question by the Prime Minister, Mr.MacDonald said that his suggestion as to tactics would be                       -15-
to put his plan to the informal joint body which had, met                                                    iearlier that day, i.e. the Meeting at which both the jews and the representatives of the neighbouring Arab stageshad been present, and at which the only party unrepresentedhad been the Palestinian Arabs.   The plan would providesomething for that body to get its teeth into.     THE PRIME MINISTER asked whether the Colonial secretary had been able to estimate what would be the Jewish reactions to his plan.     THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR THE COLONIES said that hewas not too pessimistic as to the Jewish reactions.   TheJews might be able to save their faces by accepting hisplan as a temporary and transitional arrangement, on theunderstanding that all permanent arrangements for thefuture would remain matters for discussion at the RoundTable Conference.     As regards immigration, Mr. MacDonald said that his present inclination was to abandon his 10 years&apos; plan andto make the Jews a firm offer of a pretty advantageous5 years1 plan.   The 5 years&apos; plan might be on the basisof a continuance of immigration at its present figure ofabout 12,000 a year,   On top of that, we might offer to let in 10,000 Jewish refugee children in each of the first two years.   This would have to be justified to the Arabsas a humanitarian step, undertaken in view of the Jewishpersecutions.     In all, this would give the Jews 80,000 entrants inthe 5 years&apos; period.   When asked what was to &quot;follow, weshould decline to be drawn.   We should say that all thesematters must await the Round Table Conference.     Iv;r. MacDonald did not believe that his 5 years&apos;immigration plan would greatly astonish or offend the Arabs.                      -16-
so the figure of 80,000 immigrants had already &quot;been used inthe presence of Paad Bey Hainza and Jamal Eff. Husaini withoutexciting  any very strong comments on their part.   In the last resort, if the Arabs should take serious offence at his5 years&apos;  immigration plan, he (Mr. MacDonald) might beprepared  to recommend offering a cessation of all immigra-tion at the end of the 5 years, except in so far as it wasagreed to by all three parties - British, Arabs and Jews.     Turning again to the question of the duration of theBritish occupation, the Secretary of State thought thatit would be a much more difficult matter for the Palestiniansto get rid of us than it would be for the Egyptians.   Whendeprived  of the backing of the neighbouring Arab states,the Palestinian Arabs were weaklings, and badly neededsupport such as we were in a position to give.   Again,the large and growing Jewish minority would want us to stay.     Another argument for staying would be that Palestineoccupied  a unique position,as it contained the Holy places of three  religions.     THE  CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER said that he felt some reluctance to use the expression &quot;independent Palestinestate&quot;.   It would certainly not be a Jewish state, but could it not be called simply &quot;the Palestine state&quot;?     THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OP DEFENCE thought thatany real  independence was so much a matter for the distantfuture that the use of the name would do no harm.     THE  SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS was in   :favour of retaining the word &quot;independent&quot;.   In his view it would have considerable psychological value.     THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA&quot;thought that the wordmight keep the Arabs happy.    The technical position wouldbe that they had been given independence and, in the                       -17-
                                                       i) 1exercise of that independence, had made their treaty with us.     THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR THE COLONIES said that he -had used the word &quot;independence&quot; that day in the presenceof Dr. vVeizmann.   Dr. &apos;7eizmann, with his usual penetration,had at once grasped the fact  that independence meant thatthe British would remain in Palestine, and had offered nooh jection.     THE MINISTER OF HEALTH said that he was inclined toprefer a 5 years&apos; plan for immigration to a 10 years&apos; plan.He thought the Jews would accept a 5 years&apos; plan.   Onthe other hand, they would probably fight to the deathagainst any veto after thst period.,     THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES said that dr. Weizmann had up to the present time preferred a 10 years&apos;plan.     THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS wondered whether there would be any possibility of a solution being accepted under which the Arabs could not exercise theirveto except after consultation with us, and possibly withthe neighbouring Arab states.     THE SECRETARY OF STATE POR THE COLONIES was afraid that the Palestinian Arabs did not trust us sufficiently to make this solution possible.   He must admit that he himself saw some distinct advantages in a veto.   In thefirst place, it was theoretically just, in view of Arabpolitical considerations.   In the second place,  it mightafford a practical incentive  to the Jews to settle downto work for the unity of Palestine.    In the absence of have to, the Jews would not exert themselves to reach agree-ment with the Arabs.                      -18-
     THE MINISTER OF HEALTH reminded his colleagues of thenecessity of commending the eventual solution to Americanopiniom   He was very much afraid that American opinion would he against us if the three salient points of theagreement were an independent state, restrictions on landpurchase and a veto on immigration after the first 5 years.Jewish opinion in America would he very excited against us,and there would he a distinct possibility of adventurousyoung American Jews coming over to Palestine to join in thefighting.   They would find means of trickling across thefrontier.     THE PRIME MINISTER said that in his view there was no practicable alternative to the Colonial Secretary&apos;s plan.He thought, therefore, that the meeting ought to authorisethe Colonial Secretary to go ahead.     THE MINISTER OF HEALTH enquired what the colonial secretary intended to say about the veto.     THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES said that he intended to say nothing about it for the present.   Hisimmediate offer would be confined to the constitutionalside of the problem.   Immigration would come up in due course.     THE PRIME MINISTER was not clear as to what exactlywould be said in the Secretary of State&apos;s offer about the summoning of a Round Table Conference,,   Was the conference to be suiamoned (a) as a direct result of an agreed solution to the present discussions, or (b) when peace was restored in Palestine, which might not be for some time to come?     THE HOME SECRETARY said that his advice would be strongly in favour of the first course,.    He would not hold up the summoning of the Round Table Conference.     This was also the general view of the Meeting.
     THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER asked whether theHigh Commissioner for Palestine had teen consulted aboutthe proposed temporary arrangement, i,e. the infusionof Arab and Jewish elements into the Advisory Counciland the Executive Council, pending the results of the.Round Table Conference.     THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR-THB COLONIES said thatthe High Commissioner had been  consulted, and had agreedto an arrangement of this kind being offered.     THE MINISTER OF HEALTH enquired whether it  was  intendedto allow the Mufti to appear at the Round Table  Conference.He (Mr. Elliot) thought it very important that the Muftishould not attend,   If he did, his presence would  certainly be interpreted as meaning that  we had  sold our friends  andthat the Mufti had won.     THE SECRETARY OF STATS FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS  was  not sure that he completely agreed.   He would certainly hopethat the Mufti?s presence might be avoided.   On the otherhand, if it appeared that the 3P.ound Table Conference wouldmake real progress if the Mufti were a Delegate, and  wouldmake no progress if he were excluded;  it would probably benecessary to let him come.   On the whole, therefore,Lord Halifax favoured keeping an open  mind on this  point for the present.     THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES said that  hisown desire was to maintain the  exclusion  of  thevMufti.   The Mufti himself, of  course, was keen  to  get  back into the picture,  &quot;It might be that&apos;an. invitation  to the round Table Conference wculd turn ait  to be a way of p;-chasing the Mufti 1 s
acceptance of our solution.     THE MINISTER OP HEALTH hoped that no decision needhe taken that day as to what subjects were to appear onthe Agenda of the Round Table Conference.     THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES agreed thatthere was no need for a decision that day..   The termsof reference of the Conference might, as he had suggested at an earlier stage in the meeting, be either in quitegeneral terms or more specific.     THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS thoughtthat we should have to lay it down, at the proper stage,that no treaty would be acceptable to us which did not include satisfactory provisions on certain specified heads.     THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR T^E COLONIES suggested as a matter of detail that we ought to avoid in ourpronouncements speaking of &quot;safeguards for the minority&quot;..The Jews would resent the implication that they were always to continue as a minority.   vve should employ insteadsome such phrase as ^safeguards for the various communities&quot;.          A general approval was given to the tentative          proposals developed by the Secretary of State          for the Colonies, and summarised on pages 4          to  7 above.          The Secretary of State for the Colonies was          authorised, in the light of the discussion          at the present Meeting, to put forward those          proposals as a basis of negotiation.Richmond Terrace, S.W.l,   February 24th, 1939.
