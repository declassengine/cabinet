I                              SHIPPING AND SHIPBUILDING.                    Memorandum by the President of- the Board of Trade.                  (1)  The Cabinet on the 18th January last               considered my memorandum /c.P, 6(39^ on the request               of the  shipping industry for assistance and decided               /Cabinet 1(39) Conclusion 7/ to set up a Cabinet               Committee composed as under:-                    The Lord Chancellor.                    The Chancellor of the Exchequer.                    The Lord President of the Council.                    The President of the Board of Trade.                    The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.                    The First Lord of the Admiralty.                    The Secretary of State for Scotland.                    The Minister of Transport,               to consider -                  (a)  requests for financial assistance made                       by the shipping industry;                  (b)  proposals for assistance to the shipbuilding ^ &quot;                       indus try,               and to  report to the Cabinet.                  (2)  I submitted a memorandum to the Committee at               their first meeting on 21st January,    I asked for  no               immediate decisions at  that meeting as much work remained               to be done before I could submit any final  schemes.               The Committee v/ere, however, in general agreement with               my tentative conclusions, namely -                  (a)  that the question of a tramp shipping subsidy                      deserved further consideration both  from the point  of                      view of the shipping industry and of its effect on                      shipbuilding;                  (b)  that the proposal of the shipping industry for  a                      defence fund for the  assistance&apos;  of liners, though                      inacceptable in many of its details, required further                      examination in principle;                  (c)  that the proposal for a subsidy for  coastwise                                      -1-
     shipping did not merit further investigation,     and that no action in respect of tankers was     necessary;     (d) that, in view of the urgent needs of     national security, consideration should he     given to a scheme designed to stimulate the     immediate building of ships, and the     possibility of linking this with the formation     of a shipping reserve should be explored;and I was authorised to proceed on this basis, keeping in close touch with the Treasury,,   (3) At their second meeting, on the 14th March, theCommittee considered another memorandum by me - seePaper Solo 39  (g) (Annex  A) - in which I submitted proposals on  the following subjects  :-         (a)  Tramp shipping         (b)  Shipbuilding         (c)  Reserve&apos;of  tonnage         (d)  Liner shipping   (4)  It will be  seen from  annex  B  that,  subject tofurther siscussion for the purpose  of drawing updetailed schemes,  the  Committee  agreed with  proposalsfor -          (i)  the grant of  a  subsidy  for  tramp shipping;         (ii)  the offer of  loans  on favourable terms  for               the  building of  tramps and cargo  liners;        (ill)  the formation of  a  reserve  of tonnage.
     (5) As regards my proposal for the  appointment of  aCommittee with the title Liner Defence Committee  to examineapplications of individual Liner Companies  for financialassistance in meeting State-aided foreign competition,  theCommittee agreed that the necessary financial  provision should &quot;be made to enable such assistance to be renderedin cases approved by the Board of Trade  and Treasury.   TheChancellor of the Exchequer raised certain  questionsregarding the  functions of the Committee,  and the committee decided to leave this matter over for further  discussion between the Chancellor and myself.     (6) The Committee also considered the  proposal explained!in my memorandum for offering a special  inducement  toshipowners to order ships in the next twelve months in  orderto maintain the activity of the shipping industry.  TheChancellor of the Exchequer found himself unable  to agree  tothis without further consideration, and  the committee decided in this case  ,also to leave the  matter for further discussion between the Chancellor and myself.     (7) Since then, I have discussed these outstanding points with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, with thefollowing results.     (8) Liner Defence Committee -  The  Chancellor  of  theExchequer thought it essential to be satisfied that theCommittee would not have the independence or the  wide  termsof    reference proposed by the shipping industry, and  thatit should be made clear to the industry  that the  Governmentcould not accept their proposal that the recommendations ofthe Committee would necessarily be followed.  He  considered it ver3/ important that applications by  liner companies should receive close and impartial scrutiny and should  notbe accepted, unless assistance was clearly Justified.
   (9) I fully realise the importance of  these  considerations,and I have informed the Chancellor that I shall do  my best  to select as members of the Committee men who will apply astrong and independent judgment to shipowners&apos;  applications,and that the terms of reference suggested by the shipping industry will be reduced to narrower and more satisfactorylimits.  I shall be quite prepared accordingly  to make itclear to the industry that the Committee which  the  government propose to set up does not fu&apos;lfil all the conditionsproposed by the industry, and, in i^articular, that  theGovernment do not accept the industry&apos;s proposal that therecommendations of the Committee should necessarily beaccepted by the Government.  On this basis, the Chancelloragrees to the proposal that the Committee should be appointed.   (id) Shipbuilding. The Chancellor agrees that someinducement, besides those afforded by the measures  referredto in paragraph (4) should be offered to ensure the earlyplacing of shipbuilding orders in order to maintain the productive capacity of the shipbuilding industry.  I haveagreed to do my best to meet the needs of the tramp shipping industry for subsidy within the limits of a total annualsubsidy of  2^ millions instead of a total of  3 millions as requested by the industry and proposed by me to  theCabinet Committee, and the Chancellor has agreed that thebalance of  ^ million per annum for five years may be expended in the form of  some special inducement toshipowners to place orders for tramp ships within a period not exceeding the next twelve months, and that a further sum of  ^ million per annum for five years may be expendedto achieve a similar result in the case of plain cargoliners.  The nature of the schemes to be adopted for thispurpose will be further  discussed between the Treasury and theBoard of Trade, who will also take the tramp and cargo linersections of the shipping inuustry  into consultation.
                     Conclusions,   (ll) As a result of.the deliberations of the CabinetCommittee and the subsequent discussions between theChancellor af the Exchequer and myself,  the following arethe positive measures which are recommended to the Cabinet ,for adoption:-   (i) That a tramp shipping subsidy of  2f millions per       annum should be made available for a period of five       years subject to an arrangement for determining, by       reference to the index number of shipping freights,       whether in any given year subsidy should be paid in       full, or paid at a reduced  rate,  or not paid8              Conditions would be  attached to the subsidy,         similar to those attaching to the previous subsidy,         regarding employment of British crews, compliance         with National Maritime Board Agreements where         applicable and maintenance of freight co-operation.         Shipowners would also be  required to do their         utmost to promote the formation of an international         laying-up scheme which would help to safeguard the         level of freight rates.              The industry would also be required to organise         itself so as to satisfy the Government that at the         end of the subsidy period it will be in a better         position than:it now is to maintain itself without         Government assistance.   (ii) That  10 millions should be made available for        lending to shipowners over a period of two years at        favourable rates of interest for the purpose of        building tramps and plain cargo liners.              The loans would be made on financial terms         similar to those in the Scrap and Build Scheme under         the British Shipping (Assistance)&apos; Act, 1935, i.e.         repayment over twelve years and interest at         favourable rates.  (iii) That for the purpose of forming a reserve of tonnage        by the purchase of useful cargo vessels which would        otherwise be sold to foreign owners or sold for        breaking up, a sum not exceeding  2 millions,        together with the sum required for the maintenanoe        of the vessels, should be provided.
   (iv) That as regards the defence of liner shipping from        State-aided foreign Competition;, financial provision        should he made to enable assistance to be rendered to        individual liner companies requiring such assistance,        and that an Advisory Committee should be appointed        to examine and report on applications for such        assistance.               The industry asked for  5 millions for five          years, though without expecting anything like          this sum to be spent.  It is not considered          necessary to-indicate a sum.  If one is called          for by legislative practice then  10 millions for          two years might be stated.               As a condition of setting up the Committee the          liner section of the industry should be required to          work out a plan for the maintenance of a defence          fund, if such a fund is necessary, out of the          resources of the industry after Government          assistance comes to an end.   (v)  That expenditure should be authorised of a sum not        exceeding  -g- million per annum for five years ( ^        million for tramps and  ^ million for cargo liners)        to provide a special inducement for the placing of        orders for new&apos;ships in the next twelve months.               I propose to meet the shipbuilding industry,          and the industries supplying shipbuilding          requirements, with a view to getting such guarantees          in respect of prices as may be practicable.   (12) These proposals, if adopted, would, of course,require legislation and the details of this would need a considerable amount of working out involving discussions with the shipping industry.  If and when my proposals are authorised by the Cabinet, I should wish to make animmediate statement on general lines in order that there might be no avoidable delay in the placing of o;r.derrs :for new ships.
   (13) To secure this it will &quot;be necessary to say that,when legislation is introduced, the House of Commons willbe asked, so far as assistance for shipbuilding isconcerned, to agree that orders placed after my announcement,but before the passing! of the Act, will not &quot;be excludedfrom consideration for this assistance.O.F.G.S.BGaRD OF TRADE,  17th March, 1939,

Since the last nee ting of the &apos; Cabinet Committee, I             have considered the needs of the shipping and shipbuilding             industries and 6&apos;iscv.ssions on the subject have taken place             between the Board of Trade and the Treasury.   I desire             to submit proposals on the following subjects:-                       (a) Tramp shipping.                       (b) Shipbuilding.                       (c) Reserve of tonnage.                       (d) Liner shipping.                2. I approached the  matter primarily from the  point             of view of wartine needs, but I an satisfied that  the             proposals I a:i making are consistent with the welfare of             the shipping end shipbuilding industries on a long-tern             basis.                3. As regards wartime needs, it is essential (a) to             maintain and, if possible, to increase the mercantile marine             and (b) to maintain the productive capacity &amp;f the             shipbuilding industry.  The prospect of being able to avail             ourselves of neutral shipping in wartime is  not such;, in             my view, as to relieve xis of the necessit:?&quot; of taking             measures to secure these objectives.                                  TRAMP jSEI.shipping.                4. Wartime requirements :.uake it essential to conserve             British traiup shipping, which represents about 40  per cent.
of our cargo tonnage and. includes a. large proportion of the medium sized ships  most valuable for maintaining sup-pliesin time of war.  The danger of serious decline isparticularly great in the case of tramp shipping, sincetramp trade .is immediately affected &quot;by market conditions and. the owners of a large proportion of the British trampfleet are small men without the financial resources to resist prolonged, depression.   5* Depression has again fallen on the industry and hasdestroyed confidence in the future.  It is essential,  inthe present international situation, to ensure the industry&apos;spreservation and only the renewal of the tramp shippingsubsidy for a period of years would, in my view, achieve this object.   6. My proposal is that we  should make ava.ila.b3e a  trampshipping subsidy of  3 million per annum for  a period  of  fiveyears, with an arrangement  similar to  that  in operation underthe previous subsidy to ensure that the  subsidy  is reducedas the freight index  rises above a certain point until  thesubsidy is extinguished.  There  should also be an arrangementpermitting adjustment of  subsidy in the event of a veryprosperous year during  the  subsidy period.   7. The details of the;  arrangements  for reducing subsidy by reference to the freight  index will require further  discussionbut the proposal put forward  by  the . shipowners, which hasin my opinion much  to commend it, is that in  order to  meetincreased expenses  and  assist them.against  intensified foreigrcompetition the maximum amount of subsidy ( 3 million) should.be payable in  each  year when  the average index figure  is100;] of the 1929 average  instead of 92% as  in the previoussubsidy; and should be less if the index figure  is above100;.; until it  is extinguished at 110$  of 1929.
   8.  I suggest that conditions should he attached to thesubsidy similar to those attaching to the previous subsidyregarding employment of British crews, compliance with national Maritime Board Agreements where applicable andmaintenance of freight Co-operation.  I would also proposeto require shipowners to do their utmost to promote theformation of an international laying-up scheme which would help to safeguard the level of freight rates.   9. A further condition to which I attach importance is that the industry should organise itself so as tosatisfy the Government that at the end of the subsidy .period it will be in a better position than it now is tomaintain itself without Government assistance.   10. My hope is that the subsidy could be broughtinto operation as from the 1st July next.  The expenditurerequired in the current financial year would not exceed lg- million.                      SHIPBUILDING.   11. In the memorandum on the British Mercantile Marinecirculated to  the Committee of Imperial Defence on mybehalf on 8th  November, 1938  (C.I.D.  1481-B), it  is  shownthat  the merchant fleet at its present level  is sufficientto meet our estimated war-time needs, but barely  so.The  conclusion involves the assumption that  our shipyardswould be able, allowing for warship  production, to produce in the first year of war about a  million  gross tons  ofmerchant shipping,  excluding  tankers.  Production of one million  tons in  the first  year of war could  not be attainedunless  the yards were working to  about that  capacitybefore war broke out.   12.   Owing  to the heavy decline in merchant  shipbuildingorders,  the rate of building  at  present  has  fallensubstantially  below that  level  and will  fall further unlesssomething  is done  to  check and  reverse the  process,  andespecially  to  retain  the  supply  of shipyard  labour.                     -3-
   13.  The decision to grant a tramp shipping subsidy for ?period of years would probably lead, to the early placing ofsome orders, but not sufficient to restore building in thenext few months to the level necessary to provide againstwar-time requirements.  Two factors militate against earlyresumption of building on a substantial scale: (l) thepresent high price of new ships; and (2) many Companies arewithout the liquid resources necessary for building,   14,  I have two proposals to make to meet this situation(l) an inducement to shipowners to place orders for trampsand plain cargo liners in the next twelve months; and (2)loans for building tramps and cargo liners during the next two years,     (1) Inducment for ordering ships in the next twelvemonths,   15,  We must, as a temporary arrangement, do something to encourage shipowners to surmount the price difficulty.               Tramp ships - Bonus under the tramp                     shipping subsidy scheme,   16.  My suggestion is that vessels ordered during the twelve months after the announcement of the scheme, whichsubsequently became eligible for tramp subsidy, would receive in each year up to the termination of the subsidya special allowance over and above the amount received bythem in respect of the ordinary subsidy.  This specialallowance would be fixed at such an amount as. would, overthe whole period, yield to the shipowner enough  to overcome the obstacle of the present high prices of ships,,   17,  The amount of special allowance to be given pership would need to be worked out in discussion with the shipowners, but would probably be  about  1 per gross tonever and above the amount of tramp shipping subsidy.
   18. As regards the total cost sf the scheme,  I should consider a successful response to it about 50 new shipsordered during the next year.  On this basis, the amount required when all the vessels were completed would probably not exceed  250,000 per annum or  1^ millions over thewhole period.  The sum needed in the financial year1939/40 would be very small, even if the tramp shippingsubsidy came into cperatiem on 1st July, 1939.                    Cargo liners.   19. It is more difficult to suggest the form inwhich some equivalent assistance could be given toshipowners for building new cargo liners.  I should prefer to do it in connection with the scheme of loans for ship building which is discussed in the next section of thismemorandum - perhaps by an arrangement under which, in thecase of loans for the building of cargo liners orderedin the next twelve months, the interest on the loans wasremitted in any year (during the five years of the trampsubsidy) in vrtiich, owing to the low level of freight rates,tramp shipping subsidy was paid.  Whether an arrangement on these lin.es would be sufficient to secure the orderswe desire, or whether some other scheme would be preferable,would be a matter for discussion with representatives of the cargo liner owners;  and it might be found necessary toprovide for them an inducement equivalent to that suggested above for tramp owners, namely, the payment  of a definiteamaunt far each of a definite number of years.   20. I suggest that I should be authorised to workout with the cargo liner owners a suitable scheme for thepurpose, to cost not more  in total than, say,  1^ millions *The amount required in the financial year 1939/40 wouldnot be large.
in. oJL U&apos;J21. In connection with the above proposals for encouraging the building of tramps and cargo liners,  I should propose to discuss with the shipbuilders the possibility of their making some reduction, in price and certainly press them for an assurance that they will not increase it.(2) Loans for shipbuilding.22.  In order to meet the case of shipowners willing to build but without the liquid resources necessary, my proposal is that we should provide  10 million to be lent to shipowners over a period sf tv/o years for the purpose of building, on financial terms similar to those in the Scrap and Build Scheme under the British Shipping (assistance) iVct, 1935,  i.e. repayment over twelve years and interest at favourable rates.23. The scheme should apply to tramps and plain cargo liners ordered after the date of its announcement.    I would propose to set up a Committee to consider applications.24. Vessels receiving assistance under the schemes dealt with under (l) above - paragraphs 15 to 21 - would be eligible for loans equally with other vessels.    The  10 million suggested should, be sufficient to build about eighty ships averaging 5,000 tons gross each.    The amount to be provided in 1939-40 would not be likely to exceed  2 million.RESERVE OF TONNAGE.25. The measures I have proposed regarding assistance for shipbuilding should meet the immediate needs of an emergency situation so-far as the shipbuilding industry is concerned. The tramp shipping subsidy should also help to conserve an important part of our cargo shipping.
   26.  These measures will not,  however,  necessarily increase-atany rate in the immediate future, the total  tonnage under  theBritish flag, as it would normally he expected? under presentconditions, that for every new ship added the equivalent wouldbe sold either to a foreign owner or for scrapping.   I am convinced that our margin of safety is at present so small thatsome  steps should be take^ to increase it.   27.  I consider that we should retain as  a Government reserve for use in time of war as many as possible of the vessels  whichwould otherwise be lost to foreigners in the immediate future  orsold  for breaking up, provided that they are fit for furtherservice in wartime.   The number of suitable vessels normallydisposed of in a year is about fifty of, say, 250,000 gross tons.   28.  The most direct way of achieving this object would befor the Government to buy vessels and to place there in reserveduring the present period of international instability.   Thevessels would not be brought out for trading except in anemergency but would be maintained in condition so that theycould be brought out for use in war when required.   Thevessels could be sold for breaking up when the need for retaining  them was at an end.   29.  I propose  that the Goverximent should immediately begin the formation of such a reserve.   30.  The cost *f acquiring the vessels would be about  million.   Some part of this would be recovered when thevessels were eventually sold for scrapping.    The initial  costof purchase would  fall mainly in the financial year 1939-40, butprovision would have to be made in subsequent years for themaintenance  of the vessels,,  The amount required f*r thispurpose would be about  100,000 a year.   31.&apos; The  details  wf the  scheme, particularly regardingarrangements for purchase and sale of the vessels and for  their maintenance  would  require discussion with shipowner.                        -7-
to any section of the shipping industry that shipowners&quot;belonging to that section who wish to dispose of any of their ships either to foreign owners or for breaking up should firstoffer them to the Government for inclusion in the reserve,  ifconsidered suitable.                    LINER DEFENCE FUND.   33.  An undertaking was given by the Government in 1934 toconsider and if necessary give assistance to Liner Companiessuffering from subsidies and other special forms of competition.There are a number of cases of this kind which must arise for investigation and there is a good case for establishingmachinery to enable us to carry out the undertaking of 1934.   34. My proposal is that we should establish an AdvisoryCommittee to receive requests for assistance from LinerCompanies and to advise the Government as to the measures tobe taken in response to the request.    The decision on such recommendations would rest with the Government.   35&apos;.  In order to make decisions effective without loss oftime Parliament should be asked to grant authority to theBoard of Trade to make payments (loans or grants) out of themoney provided to that Department by parliament, in cases wherepayment was recommended by the Committee and approved by theBoard of Trade and the Treasury.   36.  I should much prefer not to fix in the legislation atotal amount for such payments, but if a sum must&apos;be stated i suggest that the limit to be fixed should be a figure of 10 millions to cover two years.    I frankly do not think thatsuch an expenditure could be justified or would be incurred.The number of instances in which a case could be made outfar  assistance  will  not  be  large,  and  theexistence  of  the  Committee  should  tend  to  reduc- thenumber of cases in which  assistance  would  need tj be sought..
Actually I should estimate that the amount required in thefinancial year 1939/40 would, not he likely to exceed  500,000.But if a sum has to be mentioned at all it muet be a largesum or the deterrent effect on foreign competitors will bereduced, and the actual claims on the fund may be increased.   57.  A. period Of two years would be sufficient to see whether the scheme worked satisfactorily.   38.  The Committee would be empowered to considerapplications where the British service is threatened withcompetition which derives its strength from foreign government financial aid or some other element with which it would not be economically practical for the shipowner to contend.   there might also be power for the Board of Trade to ask the Committeeto consider cases falling outside these limits.   39.-  As a condition of setting up the Committee the linersection of the industry should be required to work out a plan for the maintenance of a defence fund, if such a fund isnecessary, out of resources of the industry after government assistance comes, to an end. -            SUMMARY OF PROPOSALS AND PROCEDURE.   40.  The proposals I have put forward are briefly asfollows:-     (1)  The grant of a subsidy to tramp shipping amounting toa maximum of  5 millions per annum for a period of five years(paras. 6-10). -     The cost of this scheme in the financial year 1939/40, ifinstituted from 1st July next, would not exceed  l-g- millions.     (2)  A special inducement for cargo ships - tramps andplain cargo liners - built in the next twelve months.   Thedetails of the schemes remain to be worked out with the ship-owners, but authority is required to spend about  2-g- millions over the next five years (paras. 16-21).   The cost of thisscheme in the financial year 1939/40 would be small.                           - 9 -
     (3) The provision of . 10 millions over a period ef twoyears for loans for the building of cargo ships (paragraphs23-24).     The amount required in the financial year 1939-40 wouldnot be likely to exceed  2 millions by way of loan.     (4) The creation of a reserve of cargo ships for use inwar, with authority to spend up to  2 millions in the year1939/40 for the purpose (paragraphs 25-32).   This sum, i submit, could justifiably be raised as a loan.     (5) The appointment for- two years of an Advisory Committee-to examine applications from liner companies for financialassistance, and the provision of money to enable such assistanceto be given if recommended by the - Committee and approved bythe Board of Trade and the Treasury (paragraphs 34-39).     The legislation should provide  10 millions for thepurpose to cover two years.   The cost in the financial year1939/40 would not exceed  500,000, part of which might,nominally at any rate, be by way of loans to the shipping companies.  41. These proposals, if adopted, v/ould of course, require legislation and the details of this v/ould need a considerableamount of working out involving discussions with the shipping-industry.   If and when my proposals are authorised by theCabinet, I should wish to make an immediate statement on general lines in order that there might be no avoidable delay in the placing of order?; for new ships.                                           0.P.G-.S.Board of Trade,    10th March, 1939.
              COMMITTEE&apos; S CONCLUSIONS REGARDING:-               (1) Tramp Shipping Subsidy               12) Loan3 for Shipbuilding               (3) Reserve of Tonnage.   (1) Tramp Shipping Subsidy.     The Committee agreed with the proposal that a subsidy of 3 millions per annum should be made available for trampshipping over a period of five years on the understanding thatthe scale of freight index numbers which will determine whether .in any given year the subsidy should be paid in full or paid ata reduced rate or not paid should be subject to further discussion between the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the President of theBoard of Trade (who would also have to discuss it with the TrampShipping Industry) with a view to fixing the point at which fullsubsidy should be paid below the point (namely the averagefreight level of 1929).which had been suggested by the industry.   (2) Loans for shipbuilding.     The Committee agreed with the proposal that  10 million should be made available for loans to shipowners over a period oftwo years at favourable rates of interest for the purpose ofbuilding tramps and plain cargo liners.   (3) Reserve of tonnage.     The Committee agreed with the proposal that authority shouldbe given to the Board of Trade to spend a sum not exceeding 2 millions in purchasing useful cargo vessels which would otherwise be sold to foreigners or for breaking-up, with a viewto their being kept laid up during the present state ofinternational instability and maintained in condition to bebrought out for use should war break out.    The arrangements f*racquiring  and maintaining the  vessels v/ould be the subject ofdiscussion between the Chancellor and the President.
