MIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S  GOVERNMBIfi1.              TO BE KEPT UNDER LOOK AMD KEY,       COpY m              It is requested that special care may be taken to                 ensure the secrecy of this document                            CABINET.                 A  meeting of the Cabinet  will be  held at            10.50 a.m. on Monday 20th March at Ho.  10 Downing Street.                 In connection with this meeting,  I circulate            herewith a draft telegram, for despatch to our            Ambassadors at Paris, Moscow and  Warsaw,  which has            been prepared at meetings held today.                                     E.E.  BRIDGES.MOST  SECRET. .P.  75  (59)Richmond Terrace-,  S.W.I.    19 March, 1959,
    DRAFT TELEGRAM to paris,   MOSCOu,   WARSAW.     My telegram No.     In spite of doubts as to accuracy of reports of Germanultimatum to Roumania, recent German absorption of Czecho-Slovakia shows clearly that German Government are resolved  togo beyond their hitherto avowed aim of consolidation of Germanrace.  They have now extended their conquest to another nation and if this should prove to be part of a definite policy ofdomination there is no State in Europe which is not directly orultimately threatened.     In the circumstances thus created it seems to His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to be desirable to proceed without delay to theorganisation of mutual support on the part of all those whorealise the necessity of protecting international society from further violation of fundamental laws on which it rests.     As a first step they propose that the French, Soviet and polish Governments should join with His Majesty&apos;s Government insigning and publishing a formal declaration the terms of whichthey suggest should be on the lines of the following:-     &quot;We the undersigned hereby declare that inasmuch as thesecurity and political independence of European States are  mattersof common interest and&apos;concern, we have pledged ourselvesimmediately to consult together in the event of any action beingtaken which appears to constitute a threat to the  said security or independence.&quot;     It appears to us that the publication of such a declaration                                                      would
would in itself be a valuable contribution to the stability of Europe and we should propose that after publication thereshould be an examination by the signatories of any specificsituation which seems likely in existing circumstances to cause anxiety, and that consideration should be given to thenature of any action which might he taken.     Please endeavour immediately to obtain the views ofGovernment to which you are accredited.  His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwould he prepared to sign declaration immediately the three other Governments indicate their readiness to do so.     we should propose to say nothing of this to otherGovernments before the four Powers are agreed on the declaration.
