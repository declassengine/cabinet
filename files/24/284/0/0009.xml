COPY No.  5 0CP. 62 (39)THE CABINETTHE ARMY  AND AIR  FORGE  (ANNUAL)  BILL      MEMORANDUM BY  THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR    1. I circulate  herewith  the Army and Air Force  (Annual) Bill,  with a    110prefatory  memorandum explaining the amendments of the Army Act and the  GeneralAir Force  Act.                                                                  5284    2. I think that I need draw special attention only to  Clauses 4 and 5 of theBill, which relate  to billeting; and to Clause 11, which relates to certain flyingoffences.    (a)  Clause 4 (which is applicable also to- the  Air  Force Act) is a natural out-          come of the process of mechanization.  It will permit the billeting of          vehicles in use  for the purposes of the military or air forces in buildings          or on open land in time of emergency (but not in peace).   As is the          case in  the billeting in an emergency  of officers, men and horses, the          prices to be  paid  for the  billeting  of vehicles  are  to  be fixed  by          regulations made  by the Army Council (or the Air Council), with the          consent of the Treasury,  subject to  annulment  by Parliament.   No          payment for billeting will be made when vehicles are billeted in the          open on land not made up for the passage or parking of vehicles, or on          land so made up where vehicles are normally allowed  to stand free of          charge.   In all cases, however, compensation will be payable when          buildings or land are damaged as a result of billeting.    (b)  Clause 5 amends  the Second Schedule  of the  Army Act and Air Force          Act in regard to the meals to be supplied to soldiers and airmen when          billeted.  The  amendments  are designed to bring these meals more          into line with  the  meals now  supplied  to soldiers  and  airmen in          barracks, and,  in particular, to  supply them with a  fourth meal in          this case, tea.               The prices to be paid  for  the four meals, as laid down in the          Schedule to the Bill, total 2s. 3^. as compared with is. gd. now payable          for three meals. The difference  covers the retail cost of the  extra food.    (c)  Clause 11  (which relates primarily to  certain offences in  connection with          the flying of aircraft) comprises  amendments of Sections 9  and 39A of          the Air Force Act.  Section  39A of the Air Force Act  has no counter-          part  in the Army Act, and  corresponding amendment of  the Army          Act is not needed.    3. As my colleagues are  aware, the Bill must receive the Royal  Assent  by30th April, and, in view of the  incidence of Easter,  I desire to circulate the Billimmediately after its First Reading which  follows automatically on the report stage  of Vote A of the Service Departments&apos; Estimates.

Army and Air Force (Annual) Bill.               NOTES ON CLAUSES.                     CLAUSE 4.    This clause enables vehicles to be billeted in times of emergency  in the  same way as horses, but  has no application to  ordinary times when no emergency exists.    All that can be required under the clause is standingroom for the vehicles, and payment is to be made in thecase of buildings and artificially made-up parking placeson a scale prescribed  by regulations.  Subsection (2) ofthe clause applies  to these regulations the provisions ofsection 108A requiring them to be laid before parliament and enabling  Parliament to present addresses  with aview to their annulment.    Subsection (3) of the clause  requires compensation to be paid in all cases of damage occasioned by billetingunder s.  108A whether done by officers and men, horsesor vehicles.  The  existing section  is limited to  damage done by  officers and men to the premises in which  theyare billeted and omits damage, e.g., to a stable in whichhorses  are billeted, the men being billeted elsewhere.                     CLAUSE 5.    This substitutes new provisions as to the meals whichhave to be furnished for billeted soldiers, in place of theexisting  provisions  which  are  expressed  in   archaiclanguage, do not take account of the fact that a soldieris now allowed tea and supper as separate meals,  and are otherwise not in accord with present-day ideas as to  diet.The Schedule to the Bill has been drafted so as to accord with this clause,  and the amounts to be  paid  under there are calculated  on the assumption that it will become law.    It should  be observed that (1) the obligation of theperson on whom soldiers are billeted is to provide the specified meals or meals  substantially equivalent  to them,(2) under s. 108A  (3)  (c) of the Army Act the standardof the  meals to be provided can be lowered during anemergency and the prices paid varied by regulations.    92-3                 A
                      CLAUSE 6.    This clause makes a formal amendment consequentialon the Eire agreement of last year.                      CLAUSE 7.    This applies clauses 4 to 6 to the Air Force Act.                      CLAUSE 8.    One of the punishments which can be awarded  inthe case of an officer whose promotion depends on thelength of his service is forfeiture of the whole or any partof his service for  purposes of promotion.  In the caseof an officer who is dealt  with summarily under sectionforty-seven of the Army Act and in the case of an officerof the Indian  Army who  is tried by court-martial, thispunishment can be  combined  with a  severe reprimandor reprimand; but this is not  so under the Army Act asit stands in the case of an  officer  tried by court-martialwho does not belong to the Indian Army.  This clauseremoves this anomaly by extending the powers possessedin  this respect by courts-martial in  the  case  of officersof the Indian  Army to all officers.  Most officers of theBritish Army  are now on a  time promotion basis upto the rank of major.  Subsection (2) of the  clause isconsequential.          a                      CLAUSE 9.    Under section ninety of  the Army Act,  a soldierwho is sent home to the United Kingdom after the time has arrived for his discharge  or transfer to the reservehas normally  to be discharged  or transferred with  allconvenient speed  after his arrival, but  may,  with his consent, be retained with the  colours for a  period notmore  than three months.   The purpose of the retentionis to enable a  soldier  to re-establish himself in  civil life,before ceasing to draw army  pay.  This clause extendsthat period up to a maximum of six months, so as to give time,  in proper cases, for a  full course of vocational training on army pay prior to discharge or transfer to thereserve.   In  all  cases, the   consent  of  the soldier isnecessary.

The separation of India and  Burma on  1st  April,1937, necessitates the formation of an Army  in BurmaReserve  of Officers to fill,  in  Burma, a correspondingrole in relation to the Army in Burma to that which theArmy in India Reserve of Officers fills in India  in relationto the Army in India.   The amendment contained inthis  clause will render the officers of the new Reserve,when it is formed, subject to military law in like manner as officers of the Army in India Reserve of Officers.                      CLAUSE 11.    This clause makes express provision  for the trial by court-martial of certain  Offences which   have hitherto been usually  dealt with as &quot; conduct to the prejudiceof good order and air force oUscipline &quot; under the general provisions  of section  forty  of the Air Force  Act.  the offences dealt with are all  of them offences in connectionwith the flying of aircraft, except the first one  which covers the case of, e.g., the mechanic who signs a certificatethat the petrol tank of an  aircraft is full when he hasnot verified that that is so.    Subsection  (2) makes it clear that, where an  officer or airman  has been nominated to be the captain of an aircraft on a particular flight, all present in the aircraftmust obey his orders, even  though they are of superiorrank.                      CLAUSE 12.    The definition of &quot; officer &quot; in  section one hundredand ninety of the  Air Force Act at the moment includesofficers  of  the Indian air force when they are serving with the Royal Air Force.  The present clause  extendsthe definition to cover an  officer of the Burma air forcein similar circumstances, if and when such  an air force is created.
