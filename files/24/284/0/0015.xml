SECRET.CP.  68 (59).                                            COPY NO. 3*                           CABINET.                     THE BUILDING SOCIETIES BILL.                   Memorandum by the Lord Chancellor.        1.       I attach a draft of the Building Societies Bill,        WHICH THE Committee on Building Societies recommend the        CABINET TO approve for introduction at a very early date.        2.       The Bill has been considered at different stages        BOTH BY THE Home Affairs Committee and by the Committee on        BUILDING Societies, as well as by an Official Committee        WHICH HAS discussed the major points with representatives        OF THE Building Societies.   While these representatives        HAVE NOT SEEN any actual draft of the Bill, they are in        GENERAL agreement with its provisions.        3.       When on 1ST February, 1939 (Cabinet 4 (39) Conclusion 3)        THE CABINET last considered the question, judgment had NOT BEEN        GIVEN IN THE Borders case.   This judgment, which was given        ON 13TH February, assumed a form so different from that which        HAD BEEN anticipated that considerable changes have had TO BE        MADE IN THE draft Bill.   Certain changes have also been made        IN order TO meet points of criticism of existing practice        DEALT with (but in an unsatisfactory way) in Miss Ellen        Wilkinson&apos;S Bill.[THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENT).
4.      The main changes in the Government Bill are:-        (i) Clause 4.   Provisions designed to prevent the            &quot;borrower from assuming unjustifiably that the            making of an advance to him by the Society is            evidence that the estate is sufficient security            for that advanceo       (ii) Clause 5.   Provision to ensure that, when a            borrower falls into arrears and the Building            Society decides to sell the property in the            exercise of its powers as mortgagee thereof, it            must do so for the best price that can reason-            ably be obtained in the circumstances, notwith-            standing any agreement with the borrower to the            contrary.      (iii) Clause 6.   Provision to restrict payment of            commissions, etc, by a Building Society to            builders and. other persons having an interest            in the sale of property for the purpose of            inducing them to introduce business to the            Society.
