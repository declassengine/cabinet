              BOARD OP TRADE ADVISORY COUNCIL.              STATE OF TRADE AT JANUARY,  1939.     Summary of Reports submitted by the  members  of  the Boardof Trade Advisory Council (supplemented in some cases  withstatistical information from other sources.     OVERSEAS TRADE.   Imports in January ( 75.6 million)showed a decline of  9.3 million as compared with January,1938.  Imports of raw materials and articles mainlyunmanufactured were  4.3 million less and imports of food,drink and tobacco  1.1 million less.   Exports of UnitedKingdom products ( 39.5 million) were  1.7 million lessthan in January, 1938.     RAILWAY TRAFFIC.  In the 4 weeks ended 29th January1939 railway traffic receipts decreased by  957,000 or83*S? as compared with corresponding period in 1938.     EMPLOYMENT.. Employment shewed a decline between the12th December and the 16th January.  A marked reductionin employment normally occurs in January in many industriesowing to a temporary slackening in activity after Christmas.The effects of this seasonal decline were accentuated at the16th January by the severe weather which restricted outdooremployment at that date.     It is provisionally estimated that at the 16th january the number of insured persons, aged 16 to 64, in employmentin Great Britain (inclusive of persons insured under theAgricultural Scheme and in the classes of domestic employment which became insurable on the 4th April, 1938) . was 12,079,000This was 184,000 less than at the 12th December and approximately 50,000 less than at the 17th January, 1938.
a 0     SHIPPINGb  The principal freight markets showed littlematerial change, apart from some activity in the River PlateSection,,  The Chamber of Shipping index number of freightswas 12008 in January as compared with 124.1 in December, and138,2 in January, 1938.  Laid up tonnage in United Kingdomand Eire ports amounted to 452.366 net tons on January 1stas compared with 455,667 tons on October 1st and 174,633tons on January 1st 1938,  The corresponding figures forBritish vessels only were 342,423, 363,252 and 95,377respectively.     SHIPBUILDING,,  Orders for Merchant Shipbuilding are practically non-existent.  Naval work continues to providethe bulk of employment in shipyards-^     BANKING, Provincial clearings in January amounted to 115,651,000, a decline of 6 per cent, as compared withJanuary   1938.  This decline is smaller than thecorresponding decline in any month within the last year.     The bill rate has remained at 17 per cente since                                   32mid-January.FINANCIAL conditional.I0NS ABROAD.     France.  The improvement in French monetary conditionswas marked by a further reduction in the French bank rate to2jh. on January 3rd and by a reduction in the rate of treasury bills to 1^!.  The resumption of bond issuesfor industrial borrowers is another encouraging sign.pthe amount placed in the course of the month amountingto nearly as much as in the whole year 1936, when about 3,500,000 was subscribed.  Industrial production isimproving;  the production index is said to have risen by six points in the last two months,     Germany,,  The financial and economic situation appearsto have reached a critical point.  In the last six years the issue of Government long term loans has exceeded
 1,000 millions, and a very large volume of short termfinancing is also outstanding.  Either a slowing-down ofrearmement and the drive towards self-sufficiency orinflation appears to be. inevitable  The note circulationhas increased during the past 12 months by over  200,000,000of which sum  80,000,000 can be attributed to the absorption of Austria and the Sudeten territories in the reich.  The favourable visible balance of trade of  3 millions for the 2nd Reich in 1937 became an unfavourable&quot;balance of  16 millions in 1938: for Greater germany the adverse &quot;balance in 1938 was  36 millions.     United States of- America.,  Business has not improvedowing to nervousness about political devlopments athome and abroad.  A return of confidence would release  thelatent demand for goods - particularly capital goods.     NON-FBRROUS METALS..  Buying of non-ferrous metals  forre-armament purposes has diminished;1  the pause in the recovery of business in the United  States has also reduced the demand for metals.. Prices declined  slightly in  thecourse of January.     ;     ENGINEERING.,  The proportion  of  unemployment for january  in  the  engineering  industry was  8.5 $ as  comparedwith  7o9;&apos;&apos;  in December, and  8.2   in November.      Not  enough  new  business  is  at present  being placed to  guarantee a  recovery  in  the  industry.  The recent reductions  in  iron and  steel  prices may  not yet  have had time,  it is thought,  to  &quot;oil ng about the  expected revival of  enterprise.      The aggregate tonnage  of machinery  exported during 1938, 459,990  tons is  the largest for any year since 1930; the value of exports was greater in 1938 than in 1930.
     ELECTRICAL INDUSTRY.  Enquiries covering a wide range of plant  were again plentiful.  There was no change in thegeneral level of prices during January but several orders forplant for purchasers in the Empire were lost to Continentalcompetitors, who quoted abnormally low prices.     Exports of products of the electrical industry inJanuary 1939 were valued at  1,903,000 as compar&amp;d with 1,317,000 in December ana  1,344.-,000 in January 1933.      2,704 million units of electricity were generated byauthorised undertakings in Great Britain in January 1939, anincrease of 13.5 per cenc. as compared with January 1933;      MOTOR INDUSTRY.  New registrations in December were35,131,- a decline of 114 as compared with December 1937.  Oarstaxed on horse power increased by 223, buc goods vehiclesdeclined by 730.  Figures for the first quarter of the presenttrading year (October - December) show no deterioration fromlast year.     Exports of private cars and private car chassis inJanuary 1939 were 3,317 and 1,172 as compared, with ^-,^10 and2,002 respectively in January 1938.     COAL/   The downward trena of business continued inJanuary.  In the first three weeks- of 1939 there was a further increase in stocks ana output declined by about 6 per cent, ascompared with the corresponding period of 1933.  Industrialdemand is stagnant and there has been a decline in exportsas compared with a year earlier.     CHEMICALS,  Exports of chemicals in 1933 were valued at 22.0 millions as compared with  24.7 millions in 1937 and 21.1 millions in 193G.  The decline compared with 1937 was due almost entirely to reduced exports to the U.S.A., Chinaand Japan.
1 3 &apos;1JL L:i J-     Deliveries of alkali and chlorine products increased bothin the home and foreign marlcets in January 1939 compared withJanuary 1933, but the demand for mineral acids has declined.The demand for.dyestuffs has fallen heavily.     POTTERY.  Unemployment in the pottery industryincreased in December;  the percentage unemployed was 23.0,as compared with 16.5 in December 1937.  The only branchesof the pottery industry in which trade was satisfactoryduring December were the manufacture of sanitary ware of fire-clay, ana the manufacture of electrical fittings.     GOTrOl,.  $here was a small increase in the volume ofnew orders towards the end of January.  The index of cottonyarn output per working day in January was 90 as comparedwith 90 in December, and 131 in January 1933 (1935 = 100).Got ton prices fell slightly during the month.  Exports ofcotton yarns were 12.9 million lbs. compared with 9.5 million lbs. in December, and 10.3 million lbs. in January1933;  exports of cotton piece goods were 121.0 million square yards compared with 103.1 million square yards in December,and 153,2 million square yards in January 1933.     WOOL.  There was a considerable recession in the woollen and worsted industry in January as compared with December.     Exports of tops, yarns and tissues showed an improvementin January on  the low levels of December.  In the industry generally, there is reported to be a scarcity of orders,particularly in the export market.     TIMBER/.  There is an upward tendency in prices ofEuropean  softwoods, though the United kingdom market forthe:n has been reduced by the recession in house-building.     Consumption of beech wood in the United kingdom has been  satisfactory owing to armaments work.
1  o11&amp; i-J     RETAIL:TRADE.  The money value of daily retail sales in December 1936 was 1.9 per cent, higher than in December1937 and 10.4 per cent, higher than in December 1936.Average daily sales of food and perishables increased in value by 1.8 per cent, in December as compared withDecember 1937;  Central London was the only area in whichthey did not increase.  The money value of daily sales ofnon-food  -merchandise was 1.9 per cent, higher in Decemberthan in December 1937 j  there was a decline of 0.3 per cent.in the period February to December 1933 as compared with theperiod February to December 1937.      The cost value of stocks at the end of December was2*9 per cent, lower than at the end of December 1937.      AUSTRALIAN TRADE.  Bales of wool received into storeduring the second half of 1933 amounted to 2,301,514 ofwhich 1,251,793 bales were disposed of by sale and shipment.The figures for the corresponding period of the previous year were 2,433,251 and 1,175,978.  The average price forgreasy wool in January 1939 was about 5/- per bale(Australian currency) above the average for the six preceding-months.     Exports of wheat and flour in the first six weeks of thecurrent season were equivalent to 9 million bushels of wheat,compared with 19 million bushels in the first 3 weeks lastseason.  This season^ butter exports are up by nearly 2Q/o.The production of canned fruits in the 1937/33 season wasa record.     CANADIiuN TRADE.  The Index of the physical volume ofbusiness for December was 115.6 compared with 123.4 inNovember.     There was a decline of 4 per cent, in the value of mineral production in 1933 as comparea with 1937, due mainly
to the fall in the prices of base metals.  Gold production at 16^.6 million dollars showed an increase of 14 per cent.over the previous year.  The prosperity of the Canadianmining industry as a whole gave stability to general economicconditions in Canada during 1933.  There was,however, adecline of 14 per cent, in the value of Canadian exports duringthe year.     IRISH TRADE.  Exports to the United Kingdom in Decembershowed a large increase in value as compared with thecorresponding months of 1937, owing partly to the betterprices obtained for exports of cattle and agricultural produce.  There was also an increase in the value of imports into Eire from the United Kingdom whereas imports from othercountries declined.     SOUTH AFRICAN TRADE.  Exports from the Union of SouthAfrica decreased in value from  125.2 millions in 193 7 to 33.2 millions in 1938;  the latter figure, however, excludes 20.7 millions worth of gold sold to oversea purchasers butearmarked and retained in the South. African Reserve Ban&amp;.Exports of merchandise (including diamonds) in December 1933showed an increase of over 5 per cent, as compared withDecember 1937.-      Imports fell from  103.2 millions in 1937 to  95.9millions in 1933.-SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE.     Argentina.  In 1933 Argentina had an adverse trade balance of 60,600,000 pesetas as compared with a favourable balance of 753,000,000 pesetas in 1937.  This change has been due chiefly to the comparative failure of the 1937-8 grainharvest.-  During the first 11 months of 1933, Argentina hadan unfavourable balance of 134,000,000 pesetas with theUnited states and exchange permits for United States imports
are reported now to &quot;be virtually suspended.  This willprobably be to the advantage of United Kingdom exports toArgentina which declined in 1933 only by. 3.5 per cent.as compared with 1937, despite the decrease in Argentinepurchasing power.  Prospects for the future depend largely upon the success with which the present bumper wheat crop isdisposed of.     Brazil.  A programme of public works and defence expenditure has been inaugurated by a recent decree.  Thewhole plan is expected to cost 3,000,000 contos of reis or 37,500,000 at the current rate of exchange.      Chile;.  A public works programme involving an expenditure of 500,000,000 pesetas was announced by theGovernment on January 12th.     Ecuador.  Owing to low world prices for the principalexports of Ecuador ana to reduced crops, economic conditionsin 1933 were unsatisfactory;  exports of cacao fromGuayaquil for the 11 months of 1933 were 17,500,000kilogrammes valued at 2,500,000 dollars compared with19,500,000 kilogrammes valued at 4,500,000 dollars in thecorresponding period of 1937.  Prospects for 1939 seem betteras the cotton crop is good and the import control system hasbeen reformed.     Peru.  Prospects for the cotton crop are satisfactory.Exports from Peru for the first 10 months of 1933 werevalued at 272,300,000 soles as compared with 303,000,000 soles in the corresponding period of 1937.      Uruguay-   1933 was less prosperous than 1937 largely owing to a reduction in exports of wool by 24 per cent.
