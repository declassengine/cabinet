O 10 wTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S                      GOVERNMENT.                     &quot;SECRET.CABINET.Copy No.C. P.69 (59).MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER OF TRANSPORT.       RESTRICTION OF RIBBON DEVE10PMENT ACT, 1955.                      AMENDING BILL.          At the end of 1934 there was an urgent demand for legislation, even if of an emergency and provisional character, to restrict ribbon development.;  and the Restriction of Ribbon.Development Act of 1935, notwithstanding consultations withrepresentatives of local authorities, landed interests andpreservation societies, was bound to be somewhat experimental,     2.   Valuable as it has proved, I recognise the force of the representations made to me by the highway authority associations,that the objects of the Act - the prevention of damage to the traffic value and amenity value of our roads - are not being as fully achieved as was hoped.   The inability or unwillingness -ofmany authorities to make full use of their powers has been duelargely to the financial provisions of the Act.     3.   When the Bill was being framed, emphasis was laid onthe importance of inducing highway authorities to take long views as to possible future road requirements, and to this end to lay downstandard widths on all the more important roads in the exercise oftheir powers under Section 1.   As an incentive, the Act providesin Section 19(2) that the Minister may make grants towardsexpenditure (including compensation) incurred by reason of thecoming into force of restrictions under Section 1, that is after a standard width has been laid down.   The Act contains no provisionfor grants to compensation which an authority may have to pay as aresult of effective exercise of their powers under-Sect ion 2 tocontrol building within 220 feet from the middle of the road and access to the road.&apos;
     4.   In practice it has &quot;been found quite  impossible to make as speedy progress as was hoped with the adoption of standardwidths. .  The accurate surveys required, for this purpose take aconsid.era.ble time to complete;  and many authorities have experienced difficulty in securing adequate trained staffs for thework.    Approximately 72,000 miles of road, are subject to Section 2restrictions;  hut for only 1,130 miles have standard widths beenadopted to date.   In consequence, whilst Section 2 was primarilyintended to be used for the preservation of amenities, authoritiesare being forced to rely upon it for the protection of roads,particularly in the matter of access.   In these circumstances,it is urged by the Associations of highway authorities that compensation paid for restrictions under Section 2 pending theadoption of standard widths should rank for Road Fund grant,     5.   I do not agree that grants should be made to expenditurearising from restrictions on building under Section 2;  but togive grants for the purpose of meeting expenditure arising fromrestrictions on access under that Section would be merely anextension of the principle already agreed by Parliament that, wherea road is subject to restrictions under Section 1 of the Act, all restrictions on access should be regarded as restrictions under that Section (Subsection (4) of Section 2) and thus eligible for grant under Section 19(2).     6.   I propose accordingly to ask for power to make grants towards the compensation which a highway authority may have to pay for injurious affection arising from restrictions on access in thecase of a roe/&quot; controlled by virtue of section 2, just as I canalready give a grant if the control be by virtue of Section 1.(In the Trunk Roads Act,  1935, Parliament has in fact given me this power over any trunk road, which is controlled only by virtue ofSection 2, no standard width having yet been determined.).   It isnot expected that the effect   of the amendment will be to imposeany substantial charge on the Road Fund,  since under the Act
compensation is payable only when it can be proved that therestrictions do in fact prejudicially affect proposals for development.     7.   The original conception of standard widths ranging from60 feet by 20 feet units  to the maximum of 160 feet was a soundone, but serious practical difficulties arise in particularinstances, of which two examples may be given:-     (1)  For a certain length of road in open country it is            accepted that the proper standard width is 100 feet;            but at one point it is proposed to retain an            existing line of trees by splaying out the up and            down carriageways some 4 feet on either side thus            bringing the  total width to 108 feet.   Under the            Act as it stands,. the Authority must at this point            adopt a standard width of 120 feet, involving the            imposition of unnecessary restrictions on strips            on either side,     (2)  In a certain road which is already partly built up            all that is effectively possible is a road width            of 85 feet.   To prescribe the next highest unit            width (of 100 feet) would mean that every person            building between the 85 feet and the 100 feet            lines would be put to the trouble of seeking          .  consent, which the highway authority would in            fact give automatically.     8.   The imposition  of restrictions on a greater area ofland than is actually required for the improvement invitesopposition,  which might not arise if the restrictions were confined to the exact width of construction contemplated.   a procedure which necessitates the application of restrictions toa greater area than is required is unsound in principle.     9.   To overcome this difficulty, I propose that Section 1should be amended to provide that a highway authority may by resolution requiring my approval, adopt,  instead of a standardwidth as at present, an improvement plan or a plan for theconstruction of a new road, as the case may be;  and thatadvertisement of the approval (as under the existing procedure)will bring into force the restrictions of Section 1 on access toand building,  etc.,  on, the land shown on the plan as required forthe road, improvement or new road.   In order to preserve as far as-possible the principle of standard, -widths, the new Clause should include a direction to the Minister and to the highway authority
                          - A -that, when considering a plan for the improvement or constructionof a road, they should,have regard to the need for securinguniform widths for roads.   The provisions for advertisement, fornotice to owners on the register and for deposit of particulars,will remain as at present.    10.   I do not think I need trouble my colleagues with thedetails of some minor amendments of the 1935 Act which I propose,with a view to removing doubts as to interpretation or simplifyingthe machinery*   These proposed amendments have been agreed withthe other Government: Departments concerned.    11.   The object of the proposed Bill is to ease thefinancial and administrative obligations on the highway authority,but none of the amendments can fairly be represented asprejudicially aifooting the position of landowners.   I do,not therefore expect the Bill to prove controversial.   In the courseof my dealings with highway authorities in the currentadministration of the 1935 Act it- will be of great assistance tome if I can assure them of the intention of the Government tointroduce the amending legislation set out in paragraphs 6 and 903? this memorandum.    12.   I therefore seek the authority of the Cabinet:-          (a)  to inform highway authorities, as occasion may                 arise, that the Government intend, when possible,                 to amend the 1935 Act:-               (i)  so as to enable Road Fund grants to be given                      in connection with cornpensation payable for                      injurious affection arising from access                      control under Section 2 (paragraph 6 above);              (ii)  so as to substitute an &quot;approved plan&quot; for the                      &quot;approved standard width&quot; as the means by                      which Section 1 control will be brought into                      force (paragraph 9 above);  and
(&quot;b)   to instruct Parliamentary Counsel to draft a Bill,       with a view to its submission to the Home Affairs       Committee and subsequent introduction into       Parliament, to give effect to these proposals       and to Inclucbe minor amendments by way of       removing doubts as to interpretation or       simplifying the machinery.E.
