Annual Report upon the Financial Conditionof the Unemployment Fund at  51st December, 1958.Memorandum by the Minister of Labour.1.   The Unemployment Insurance Statutory Committee have presented their annual Report upon the financial condition of the General Account of theUnemployment Fund on the 31st December,  1958,  together with  a similar  reportin respect of the Agricultural Account of the Fund.   A proof copy of  the tworeports is annexed.2.   The General Account of the EMnd.    The balance of the General Account was 45,954,000, a smaller figure than last year owing to the fact that  20,000,000 was used to pay off debt  on the 31st March last.  The bulk ofthis balance is required as a Reserve, but there remains a surplus of 3,100,000 for distribution by further improvements of the scheme if the liabilities remained the same.   The Committee point out, however, that their estimates of the income and expenditure of the General Account of the  Fundvri.ll be affected in future years by recent or prospective changes in theUnemployment Insurance Scheme.   On the one hand, certain classes of domesticworkers were brought into insurance in April,  1938, resulting in a net gainto the General Account estimated at  500,000 in a full year.   On the  otherhand, the Committee, in their Report on Holidays in relation to UnemploymentInsurance, have recommended, and the Cabinet have recently approved, changesin the Unemployment Insurance Scheme,  which will increase the annual expenditure on the General Account by  about  200,000.   (Effect is  being given to these recommendations in the  Unemployment Insurance Bill about tobe introduced in Parliament).   Further, it is estimated that the charge for administration on the General Account  will increase by nearly  400,000 a year.These counter-balancing factors leave  an annual adverse balance of  about 100,000.
3.   IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES,  THE COMMITTEE  PROPOSE  THAT  3,000,000  OF THE SURPLUSSHOULD BE USED TO DISCHARGE PART OF THE DEBT  OF THE FUND WHICH STANDS AT present at  81,530,000 WITH A RESULTANT SAVING OF  150,000 IN THE ANNUAL  DEBT CHARGE.THE COMMITTEE CONSIDER THAT THE PROSPECTIVE LIABILITIES AND RESOURCES OF THEGENERAL ACCOUNT OF THE FUND MAY THEN BE REGARDED  AS BALANCING AND CONSEQUENTLYTHEY MAKE NO RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CHANGES  IN THE GENERAL SCHEME.4.   THE AGRICULTURAL ACCOUNT OF THE FUND.   THE  COMMITTEE REPORT THAT THE income of THE AGRICULTURAL ACCOUNT EXCEEDED EXPENDITURE  BY  949,000 DURING 1938 WHILETHE BALANCE AT 31ST DECEMBER, 1938 HAD INCREASED  TO  2,774,000;   THEY REPORT  THATTHE AGRICULTURAL ACCOUNT IS AND IS LIKELY TO  CONTINUE TO BE MORE  THAN REASONABLYSUFFICIENT TO DISCHARGE ITS LIABILITIES.    MAKING ALLO-WANCE FOR THE operation for A FULL YEAR OF THE COST OF THE IMPROVEMENTS IN THE AGRICULTURAL SCHEME,MADE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RECOMMENDATIONS IN THEIR REPORT OF A  YEAR AGO, ANDFOR AN INCREASE IN THE ANNUAL AMOUNT OF BENEFIT WHICH  THEY ASSUME WILL BE PAIDOVER A PERIOD OF YEARS, THE COMMITTEE MAKE THE FOLLOWING RECOMMENDATIONS AS  to changes REQUIRED TO MAKE THE FUND, IN RESPECT OF  ITS AGRICULTURAL ACCOUNT, NOTMORE THAN REASONABLY SUFFICIENT;   (A) THAT THE EXISTING RATES OF CONTRIBUTIONS BY EACH PARTY TO  THE SCHEME       SHOULD BE REDUCED IN RESPECT OF CONTRIBUTORS  AGED 18 AND UPWARDS BY ID.       FROM JULY, 1939 TO JULY, 1942 AND  BY -GD. THEREAFTER.   THUS, THE       CONTRIBUTION BY EACH PARTY IN RESPECT  OF AN ADULT MAN WILL BECOME 3D.       INSTEAD OF 4D. FOR THE THREE YEARS ENDING JULY, 1942 AND,  SUBJECT TO  ANY       FURTHER RECOMMENDATIONS BY THE COMMITTEE,  3-GD.  THEREAFTER.  THE  OBJECT       OF THE HIGHER REDUCTION FOR THE FIRST  THREE YEARS  IS TO REDUCE THE       PRESENT LARGE BALANCE IN THE FUND, WHICH IS IN EXCESS  OF  ANY PROBABLE       REQUIREMENT S.   (B) THAT THE FOLLOWING INCREASES SHOULD BE MADE IN THE WEEKLY RATES OF BENEFIT:PRESENT RATE.PROPOSED RATE.INCREASE.MEN AGED 21 AND  UPWARDS14/-15/-V-WOMEN AGED 21 AND  UPWARDS12/613/-6DYOUNG MEN BETWEEN12/-13/-V-18 AND 21YOUNG WOMEN BETWEEN  18 AND 219/610/-6D

(D) THAT THE MAXIMUM LIMIT IN THE WEEKLY RATE OF BENEFIT SHOULD  BE  RAISED       FROM 30/- TO 33/-.   THIS INCREASE OF 3/- CORRESPONDS TO THE INCREASE       OF 1/- IN THE PROPOSED WEEKLY RATE OF BENEFIT FOR AN ADULT MAN,  AND  OF       2/- FOR AN ADULT DEPENDANT AND TO THE ESTIMATE MADE BY THE COMMITTEE OF       THE AVERAGE INCREASE THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY IN AGRICULTURAL  WAGES.  THE       CONRNITTEE POINT OUT THAT WHILE THEY THINK IT DESIRABLE TO RAISE THE       LIMIT THE INCREASE PROPOSED WILL ESTABLISH A BENEFIT LIMIT WHICH FOR       MANY COUNTIES IS VERY HIGH IN RELATION TO THE MINIMUM WAGE.5.   THE COMMITTEE ESTIMATE THAT THEIR RECOMMENDATIONS  WILL DECREASE THE annual income OF THE FUND ON THE AGRICULTURAL ACCOUNT BY APPROXIMATELY  380,000 FORTHE THREE YEARS FROM JULY, 1939, AND  190,000 THEREAFTER;  WHILE expenditure will BE INCREASED BY ABOUT  78,000 A YEAR FOR THE FIRST THREE YEARS AND ABOUT 101,000 A YEAR THEREAFTER.6.   I THINK THAT WE SHOULD ADOPT THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE COMMITTEE WHICHARE UNANIMOUS IN RESPECT OF BOTH REPORTS.   THE RECOMMENDATION TO APPLY THESURPLUS OF ABOUT  3,000,000 ON THE GENERAL ACCOUNT TO THE REDUCTION OF DEBTIS, IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE ONLY COURSE WHICH COULD BE ADOPTED WITHOUTIMPAIRING THE FINANCES OF THAT ACCOUNT.   THE IMPROVEMENTS PROPOSED IN THERATES OF BENEFIT UNDER THE AGRICULTURAL SCHEME SHOULD COMMAND GENERAL  approval and IT IS REASONABLE TO ASSUME THAT THEY SHOULD ASSIST IN CHECKING  TO  SOMEEXTENT THE DRIFT OF MEN FROM THE LAND, YFOLCH STILL CONTINUES.   IN  MY  view the PROPOSED REDUCTION IN THE RATES OF CONTRIBUTIONS IS AN ESSENTIAL PARTOF THE PLAN FOR BRINGING THE FINANCE OF THE AGRICULTURAL SCHEME MORE INTO line with REQUIREMENTS.
7.   Subject to the chancellors concurrence,  I propose  to adopt  therecommendations as indicated above and to take the necessary action forgiving effect to those regarding the Agricultural Scheme by affirmative resolutions in both Houses.   Effect will be given on my authority to therecommendation to pay off  3,000,000 of debt under Clause 3 of theUnemployment Insurance Act, 1938;  the approval of Parliament is  notrequired.8.   In addition to their recommendations as to changes  required  to makethe Agricultural Account not more than reasonably sufficient, the Committeefurther recommend the abolition of Section 10 of the Unemployment Insurance(Agriculture) Act, 1936, which provides for a repayment  of part of thecontributions where men have been engaged under &apos;long hirings&apos; (yearly orhalf-yearly contracts of service)*   The Committee give  reasons to showthat the grounds on which these repayments were based have proved to  beunsound;   moreover, the scheme is complicated and expensive to administer.In the view of the Committee the abolition of Section 10 should be effectedunder full Parliamentary procedure.   I have already taken steps  tointroduce a clause in the new Unemployment Insurance Bill to give effect tothe recommendation of the Committee, and this has been approved by theCabinet.   Abolition of the system will save about  10,000 a year in rebatesand about . 12,000 a year in administrative costs.                                         (int.)

UNEMPLOYMENT  INSURANCE STATUTORY COMMITTEESixth Report  on  the  Financial  Condition    of  the Unemployment Fund (General    Account), as at 31st December,  1938TO THE RT. HON.  ERNEST  BROWN, M.C., M.P.,        MINISTER OF LABOUR.SIR,  BY SECTION 59 (1) OF THE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE ACT, 1935, WEARE REQUIRED TO MAKE A REPORT ON THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE UNEM-PLOYMENT FUND AT THE END OF EACH CALENDAR YEAR.  BY  SECTION 8 (1)OF THE  UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE  (AGRICULTURE) ACT, 1936, WE  AREREQUIRED  TO  EXERCISE THIS FUNCTION OF REPORTING  ON  THE FINANCIALCONDITION OF THE UNEMPLOYMENT FUND SEPARATELY WITH REGARD TO THEGENERAL AND THE AGRICULTURAL ACCOUNTS OF THE FUND.   WE SUBMITBELOW A REPORT WITH REGARD TO THE GENERAL ACCOUNT OF THE UNEMPLOY-MENT FUND, WITH A RECOMMENDATION FOR THE APPLICATION OF AN AMOUNTSTANDING TO TIRE CREDIT OF THAT ACCOUNT TOWARDS THE DISCHARGE OF PARTOF THE DEBT OF THE FUND.  WE PROPOSE TO DESCRIBE THIS REPORT INFUTURE AS OUR SIXTH GENERAL REPORT.   WE ARE  REPORTING SEPARATELYWITH REGARD TO THE AGRICULTURAL ACCOUNT.  1. WE BEGIN BY PRESENTING IN APPENDIX A A FORMAL ACCOUNT OF THEWORKING OF THE FUND IN THE CALENDAR YEAR 1938, WITH corresponding figures  FOR 1937 IN PARALLEL COLUMNS FOR COMPARISON.   THE  FIRSTPORTION  OF THIS  APPENDIX  DEALS  WITH THE GENERAL ACCOUNT.  the account HAS BEEN PREPARED FOR US BY THE ACCOUNTANT GENERAL FOR THEMINISTRY OF LABOUR.   IT IS NOT AN AUDITED ACCOUNT, BUT IT IS IN THESAME FORM AS THE ACCOUNTS OF THE FUND  WHICH  ARE  PRESENTED TOPARLIAMENT AFTER AUDIT, FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDING ON 31ST MARCH.  2. THE RECEIPTS FOR THE CALENDAR YEAR WERE  65,894,665, OF WHICH ALLBUT  1,443,412 REPRESENTED INSURANCE CONTRIBUTIONS BY EMPLOYERS,EMPLOYED PERSONS,  AND THE STATE.   THE OTHER RECEIPTS INCLUDED A NETSUM OF  1,431,243 AS INCOME FROM INVESTMENTS, INCLUDING A SMALLPROFIT ON  REALIZATION OF  CERTAIN  SECURITIES.  THE  EXPENDITURE WAS 62,320,027, MADE UP OF  51,662,000 FOR UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFIT, 5.874,592  FOR  ADMINISTRATION,  4,259,389 FOR DEBT  SERVICE,  AND 524,046 FOR MINOR ITEMS.   INCOME DURING 1938 EXCEEDED EXPENDITUREACCORDINGLY BY   3,574,638.  THE  BALANCE CARRIED FORWARD AT  31STDECEMBER, 1937, WAS  60,379,006 OF WHICH  20,000,000 WAS SUBSE-QUENTLY APPLIED, TOWARDS THE DISCHARGE OF PART OF THE DEBT OF THEFUND.   THERE WAS ACCORDINGLY A NET BALANCE AT 31ST DECEMBER, 1938,OF  43.953.644-  3.  AS COMPARED WITH  1937, CONTRIBUTIONS FROM EMPLOYERS ANDEMPLOYED PERSONS  SHOW A  DECLINE OF  65,820.  THE INCREASE OFUNEMPLOYMENT HAS BEEN SUCH  AS  TO INVOLVE A LOSS OF contribution income MUCH IN EXCESS OF THIS  FIGURE.  BUT THE LOSS HAS BEEN OFFSETBOTH BY THE GROWTH OF THE INSURED POPULATION AND BY THE EXTENSION    x 093                                              A
of insurance as from 4th April,  1938, to about 220,000 persons  ininstitutional  and  outdoor  domestic employments.  contributions from the &quot;Defence  Departments in respect of men  discharged from.M.  Forces  show a marked increase, due  to  the adjustment,  in1937, of previous capitation payments by the Defence Departments.The Exchequer contribution, being proportionate to the aggregatecontributions from other sources, shows a small increase of  56,294.Income from investments has risen materially from  674,105  to 1,431,243; the rise is due largely to the receipt in 1938 of interest payments on certain investments made,  at advantageous rates,  in1937.   Taking all items together, the income of  65,894,665 in 1938shows  an increase of  927,752  as  compared  with the income  of 64,966,913 recorded in 1937.  4. On the side of expenditure, increase of unemployment, and  ofthe proportion of unemployment ranking for benefit, has led to anincrease in the expenditure on  benefit  of  18,502,000.  The  sub-stantial rise of  1,004,592 in the cost of administration is due mainly to the  increase in unemployment and in the  proportion ranking for benefit, but partly also to improvements in Employment Exchangepremises and organization and improvements in salary scales,  etc.,for certain grades of staff.  There  is a decrease  of  1,317 in the minor item of refund of contributions paid in error and of  10,600in the item of contributions to courses of instruction.  The first  ofthese items depends on the claims made by employers and employed persons;  the second depends, as regards juveniles, on the rate of the approved  expenditure  by  Local Education  Authorities, and,  asregards adults,  on the programme  of training of  the Ministry  ofLabour.  Taking all items together, the  expenditure of  62,320,027in 1938 shows  an increase  of  18,754,840 as  compared with theexpenditure  of  43,565,187 in 1937.  5. The position as regards debt service has been materially altered by the repayment, on 31st  March, 1938,  of  20,000,000 of the out-standing debt, in  accordance with the recommendation made by  usin our  last report.  The half-yearly debt charge on the Fund wasproportionately reduced from   2,500,000  to  2,006,259 3s- 0&amp;-For the first quarter of 1938 the charge  was  at the higher rate andamounted to  1,250,000, while for the other three quarters it was  atthe reduced rate and amounted to  3,009,389, making a total for theyear of  4,259,389. The debt at the end of September, 1938, was 81,530,000, and from that date  till the end of the period laid down for repayment the rate of interest on the outstanding debt will  be^ per cent,  per annum.  6. As regards investments, the policy  was continued of investingthe growing balance of the Fund in short term securities, this policybeing  governed by the  conclusion that the securities would need  tobe  realized to meet deficiencies in the present trade cycle.   Theposition on 31st December, 1938, in relation to investments is shown
at the foot.of the Statement of Account (Appendix A).  The net rateo  interest that was being received on these investments,  after allowing for loss or profit on redemption, was slightly under 2 percent.  7. In our earlier financial reports we supplemented the formalaccount of the Unemployment Fund in the year under review, by a table showing the general course of unemployment and the financialworking of the unemployment insurance scheme, month by month from November, 1931.   In this report we limit the table, printed inAppendix B, to the three years 1936-1938;  figures for the earlier years  can be obtained, if required, from any of the  earlier reports.In: the three years covered by our present  table there are two or threeminor changes in the basis of the figures  to which attention is called in notes to the table.   The figures of income and expenditure arestatistical approximations only, but are sufficient as a general guideto the operation of the  scheme.  8. In our earlier reports we gave also a somewhat detailed accountof the principles adopted by VIS in adjusting the finance of the insur-ance scheme and estimating its surpluses or deficiencies.   It will besufficient here  to summarise this  in a few words, since those reportscan be  referred to for further information.   Starting with a state-ment  submitted to  us  in  1935  by the Committee on economic information of the Economic Advisory Council, as to what appearedthen to be the most probable mean level of unemployment for thenext complete trade cycle, we made assumptions as to the rate ofunemployment in  each  of the eight years 1936 to 1943 that would yield this mean over the eight years as a whole. The actual unemploy-ment in each of the last two years having  proved less than theassumption, at the end of each of those years we found ourselves in  aposition to declare a substantial surplus in the Unemployment Fundover and above the reserves required to meet a depression.  We dealtwith those surpluses^ amounting  in the two years together to nearly 24,000,000, by recommending  their distribution during the nexteight years in improved benefits or reduced contributions.   9. On the same assumptions as  those used in our earlier reports,while  we allowed for  the probability that unemployment  during1938 would be materially greater than in 1937, we expected during theyear  1938 to  make-a  further gain of income over expenditure of&quot; about  3,000,000,&quot; as is stated in paragraph 22 of our last financialreport.  The exact figure in our table of expectations was  3,133,000.How does the experience of 1938  compare with this expectation ?   10.  The table in  Appendix B shows clearly the change in theexperience of  the  Unemployment  Fund which followed the rise ofunemployment in  the autumn of 1937.  From May to October, 1937,the Fund was making  a weekly surplus ranging from  414,000 to
 708,000, and averaging  517,000 a week over the six months as awhole.  In February, 1938, the weekly surplus had almost vanished,falling to  26,000, and though a large surplus was recorded once more in July, in the last four months of the year there was a net loss at therate of about  20,000 a week.  This change reflects both the rise in umemployment as a whole and a rise in the proportion ranking for benefit.  The first  additions to the unemployed after a period ofgood employment  are predominant^&apos; workpeople with a record ofcontributions qualifying them for benefit, as distinct from assistance.As appears from column 5 of  the  table,  the proportion  of  totalunemployment ranking for benefit,  which ranged from 44 to 48 percent, in the six months May to October, 1937, has been nearly 60 percent, for the greater part of 1938. It should  be added that the weeklysurplus or deficiency shown in the column for any particular month is liable to disturbance by interest on investments, and by variations inthe  sale of insurance stamps;  in  July,  for instance, when unem-ployment  books,  are  due  to  be  exchanged,  the  receipts areregularly  swollen by  purchases  of stamps which legally shouldhave been purchased arid affixed before then.   11. In spite  of the changes recorded in  the last paragraph, theincome of the Fund  during 1938 has exceeded  expenditure  by anamount which, if smaller than that recorded in previous years, is stillappreciable.  From about  60,379,000 at 31ST December, 1937, thebalance of  the Unemployment Fund on 31ST December, 1938, hasbecome  43,954,000.   Allowing for the  20,000,000  used for thepayment of debt, the excess of receipts over expenditure during theyear  has been about   3,575,000.  From this, however, a deductionhas to be made for depreciation  in the capital value of investments.Part  of the  Unemployment  Fund  has been&apos; invested in securitiescarrying  relatively  high rates of interest,  and due for  earlyredemption, and in calculating the  liabilities of the Fund allowance has  been made for this loss.  In the  account itself this allowancecannot be made directly, though reference  is made to it in note (d)at the foot of the table in Appendix A.   Deducting this sum of 400,000, the true excess of income  over  expenditure during 1938becomes about  3,175,000.   12. At first sight it looks  as if our expectations for  1938 of a gainof  3,133,000 had been all but exactly realised, by the actuakgainof  3,175,000.   This  comparison, however,  does  not  correctlyrepresent the position in respect either of  resources or of liabilities.   13. On the one hand, the resources  are greater than appears.  Ineach of our last two reports we recommended changes in  the scheme,to be financed by drawing on a lump sum surplus over  a period of eight years.  These surpluses are included in the accumulated balanceof  60,379,000 with which we began in 1938.  The gain of  3,175,000made in 1938 is a  net gain, after  providing for the changes in thescheme out  of income and not by drawing on  our accumulated
 balance. Allowing for this, and making other necessary adjustments, the true position is that at the end of 1938 we have not just realised expectations, but have improved on expectations to the extent of about  3,100,000. That is to sa)&apos;, we should have a surplus of about that size for distribution by further changes of the  scheme,  if our liabilities remained the same.   14. This, however,  is not the case.  In two respects which we are bound to take into account the liabilities of the Fund have increased.   First, in our report on holidays  in relation  to Unemployment Insurance, we recommended several changes, including a lengthening of the period within  which a fresh waiting  period  should not be required,  whose  net  result would  be to  increase  the annual expenditure of the Fund by about  200,000  a year.  &apos; It  is possible that H.M. Government may introduce legislation to give  effect to this report.  At any rate, until we know that they are not likely to do so, we are bound to regard this additional expenditure, which we have recommended,  as one of  the liabilities of  the Fund.  When making the recommendation, as we did, with  the  assurance that the Fund could afford it, we had in  mind the substantial gains  above expectation  made by  the Fund  in the first half of 1938. -  Second, we have received a Memorandum from the Accountant General to  the  Ministry showing  that we must  provide  for  a substantial  increase  in the cost  of  administration in  1939,  and thereafter, as compared with the year now ended.  This prospective increase is due in the  main to improvements in the remuneration of the  staff,  and  in  the  offices   and ; premises  provided  for * the administration of unemployment  insurance.   The  additional charge in 1939 as compared with 1938  is put at  350,000.   15.  Nor, in considering the prospective charges on the general account, can we leave out of reckoning the effect  of the recom- mendations which we  are making simultaneously,  in our agricultural report, for a reduction of agricultural contributions. As is explained in paragraphs 35 and 36 of that  report,  an automatic consequence of any reduction of agricultural contributions is a reduction  of the sum charged to  the agricultural account for  administration;  since the cost of  administration is not changed thereby,  this means an increase in the liabilities of the general account.  Adoption  of our recommendations in  the  agricultural report would increase the liabilities of the  general account  in the next three years by  nearly 50,000 a year.   Adding this to the  350,000 mentioned in paragraph 14, the total additional liability of the general account for admini-stration is nearly  400,000 a year.   16.  Over and above this prospective increase in the liabilities  of the Fund,  reference  must  be made to  two other  considerations.&apos; First, part even of the  3,100,000 estimated above as the  real excess   003  &apos;                                            &apos;        B
of receipts over payments during 1938 is of the nature of a windfall,^because  part of  the expenditure  in respect   of  some  of  the improvements of benefit made in our last report  has been  incurredonly during  a portion of the year under review.   The  rate ofexpenditure  during  a whole  year will  be higher.   Second,  the 20,000,000 which last year we devoted to repayment of debt wasnot a disposable surplus.   If unemployment should work out at thelevel of our calculations we should need to borrow again  later in thetrade cycle.  Only if unemployment proved materially less than inour calculation should we be able to avoid recourse to  borrowing.Under  the terms  covering the repayment of debt,  our power of borrowing diminishes each year,  and may be materially less  than 20,000,000 if and when the necessity for borrowing arises.  On theother hand, the Fund will still have in hand, for several years to come,a substantial proportion  of the disposable surpluses declared in our last two reports and allocated for expenditure over a period of eight years.  Actually, therefore, our borrowing powers, even as diminished,should prove sufficient.  While mentioning these  two considerations,accordingly, we  do not think it necessary to take account of themexpressly in judging of the current resources  and liabilities of theFund.   17. It is clear indeed, even without taking them into account, thatthe estimated excess of income over expenditure  in 1938, amountingto  3,100,000, cannot be regarded as a disposable  surplus.  If it stoodby itself it would fall far short of providing the means of meeting boththe increased  administrative charge of   400,000  a year and the net increase of  200,000 a year due to the recommendations of our reporton holidays.  Fortunately the year 1938 has&quot; witnessed another changein the general insurance scheme, namely, the inclusion of institutionaldomestic  servants, as well  as  certain  other classes of employees,which, on balance, seems likely to strengthen  its financial position.The rate of unemployment among the persons newly brought into thescheme is below the average.  As appears from the monthly record ofthe  Unemployment  Fund  since  July,  1938,  the unemploymentpercentage, inclusive of the new classes of insured persons, has beeno-i or 0-2 below the  percentage without them.  If this  difference ismaintained, the net gain to the Unemployment Fund from the latestextension of insurance may be about  500,000 a year.  This is nearly,but not quite, enough to meet the additional liabilities of  600,000 ayear for which provision must be made.   18.  In the circumstances, it appears to us that the most appropriateway of adjusting the finance of the Unemployment  Fund on this occasion will be to devote to the reduction of debt, and the consequent reduction of debt charge, such portion of the balance now  standing in the Unemployment Fund as will be sufficient to ensure that ourincome is not less than our expenditure, and at the same time will
not involve us in increased risk of having to borrow.  Both these  endswould be accomplished by using for the repayment of debt a sum ofthe order of magnitude  of  the excess of receipts over paymentsactually realized in 1938.  To  allocate to the reduction of debt asum of  3,000,000 would reduce the debt charge by nearly  150,000 ayear.  In so far as we have a sum just exceeding  3,000,000 availablewhich was not taken into account in our former financial estimates,the whole of this reduction of the debt charge is a net gain to theFund and has not to be offset by allowing for loss of interest whichhad been expected.  With this repayment, the Fund in effect willhave, on the one hand,  150,000 a year of reduced debt charge and about  500,000 a year of increased income, to set against  liabilitiesamounting to about  600,000 a year in  respect of the  recommen-dations in  our report on holidays, and of increased charges  for administration.    19. As  required  by  section  59 (3) of  the  UnemploymentInsurance Act of 1935, we gave notice in the press on 6th December,I938, and directly to the  principal organizations of employees and employers, of our intention to make a report on the financial condi-tion  of the  Unemployment Fund.  We  received written and oralrepresentations from  the  National  Confederation of  Employers&apos;Organizations  and the Trades  Union Congress General Council.  Incommunicating with these two bodies we indicated our view that theFund was unlikely at the end of 1938 to  show a substantial surplusor a substantial deficiency, and that, as a consequence, we should probably  not  be  in  a position  to  recommend any  considerablechanges in the scheme.  20. In the light of this communication, the National confederation of Employers&apos; Organizations emphasized the importance of taking any possible opportunity of reducing contributions and of avoiding any increase in the liabilities of the Fund.  They suggested that should there be any disposable surplus of an amount  insufficient to bringabout a reduction of contributions,  it should  be allocated to thereduction of debt.               .  21. The Trades  Union  Congress General Council,  after namingthe changes which they would desire if  considerable  changes  were possible, urged that any  small disposable surplus  should be  usedfor amendment of the Anomalies Orders, putting first those relatingto married women, and second those relating to seasonal workers.In the circumstances reported above, we have no disposable surplus,and are not  in a position to act either in the direction of changingcontributions or of changing the amounts and conditions of benefit.As regards  the suggestions made by the Trades  Union congress general Council that we should recommend revision of the AnomaliesOrders, it appears  desirable to refer to the discussion of this  topicon pages 14 and 15 of our second Financial Report.  For the reasons
given there, we are of opinion that change of the provisions in regardto Anomalies should normally be undertaken only by the procedurespecially provided for  that  purpose  under section 55  of  the Un-employment  Insurance Act, 1935, and  not as part  of a  financialadjustment under section 59.   22. We received representations also from the National Federationof Grocers&apos; and Provision Dealers&apos; Associations, proposing  that anyavailable surplus should be used for  the reduction/of contributions.The National Council for Equal Citizenship urged  the  equalizationof contribution  and  benefit rates for men and women, while theAssociation of Women Clerks and Secretaries asked for an increasein benefit rates and for the  equalization of benefit rates  for men andwomen.   23. In the light of the foregoing  considerations, the prospectiveliabilities and resources of the Unemployment Fund may be regardedas substantially balancing, and no  occasion arises for  us  to report under section 59 (2) of the Act &quot; that the Unemployment Fund is oris likely to become and is likely to continue to be insufficient to dis-charge  its liabilities, or is and is likely to continue to be more thanreasonably sufficient to  discharge  its liabilities,&quot;  or to make anyconsequent recommendations for any amendment by Order of those provisions of the Act which can be so amended.     We  conclude our report on  the financial condition of the Unemployment Fund in respect of its general account by recommend- ing under section 3 (1) of  the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1938,that an amount of  3,000,000 standing to the credit of the General Account of  the Unemployment Fund  should be applied to the discharge of the liabilities of the  Fund named  in subsection  (2) of section 60 of the Unemployment  Insurance Act of 1935.              We  have the honour to be, Sir,                      Your obedient servants,                                W. H.

Third  Report on  the Financial  Conditionof the Unemployment Fund  (Agricultural    Account) as  at 31st December,  1938To the RT. HON. ERNEST BROWN,  M.C., M.P.,            Minister of Labour.SIR,                    ;  By  Section 8 (i) of the Unemployment Insurance  (Agriculture)Act, 1936, we are required to exercise our function of reporting onthe financial condition  of the Unemployment  Fund separately inrespect of its General and  of its Agricultural Accounts.  We submit below our third report  in respect of  the AgriculturalAccount, which we propose to describe in future as the Third Agri-cultural Report.  1. We attach in the second part of Appendix A a formal accountof the. receipts  and expenditure  of the Fund orithe agricultural sideduring the year 1938, similar to that  given in the first part of theAppendix for the general scheme.   The receipts of the agriculturalaccount shown in this table were  1,942,533, of which  all but 43,854 represented insurance contributions by employers, employed persons and the  State. The expenditure  was   993,649, made upof  742,000 for unemployment benefit,  and  251,649 for admini-strative and minor items.  Income  during 1938 exceeded expenditureaccordingly by  948,884,  making, with  the balance of  1,824,987carried  forward  at 31st December,  1937, a net  balance at 31stDecember, 1938, of  2,773,871.  2. As compared with 1937,  contributions from employers andemployed persons show an  increase  of  26,466.  The scheme was extended as from 4th April,  1938, to  include grooms, gamekeepersand certain  other classes of outdoor domestic servants, and theincome  for  1938  included  contributions  in  respect of  private.gardeners for a full year as  compared. with less than a full year in1937.   On the  other hand the rate of contribution  for most insuredpersons was reduced by id. for each party as from 4th July, 1938.There was an increase of  25,715  in income from investments, dueto the increase in the balance standing to the credit of the agricul-tural account.  Taking  all items together, the income of  1,942,533in 1938  showed an increase of  64,905 over  the income of  1,877,628in 1937.  3. On the side of expenditure, an increase in unemployment and.in the proportion ranking for benefit, together with  the improve-ments in benefit rates and  conditions  recommended in our lastreport,  led  to an  increase of  287,000  in the  expenditure on
agricultural  benefit.  There  was  an  increase  in  the  amountallocated to cost of administration of just under  5,000, i.e., one-eighth of the increase in the net income from contributions.  Therewas little change in the other minor items of expenditure.  taking all items together, the expenditure  of  993,649 in 1938 showed anincrease of  293,633 over the expenditure of  700,016 in 1937.      Working and Prospects of Agricultural Insurance Scheme.  4.  We give  in the second part of Appendix B, and in the  first three tables of Appendix C, statistics as to the working of insurance,and  as to. unemployment, in agriculture,  corresponding  to thoseprinted in our  last report.  The fourth table in Appendix C isnew.   It shows  the distribution in certain age groups of  insuredmales in the general scheme, in farming and forestry, and in marketgardening respectively.  It will be seen that, in the general schemeand in market gardening, the proportions over and under the  ageof 20 showed little change in the last three years.  In farming and forestry, on the other  hand, the proportion  of  the male  labour force  that is under 20 has fallen from 20-3 per cent,  to 18-5  percent.; the entry of young men  into  agricultural employment inthose three years has grown visibly smaller.  5.  As appears  from Appendix B and from the figures given above,the income on the agricultural account during  1938 has been nearlytwice the  expenditure on that account, exceeding the expenditure by about   949,000  for  the year.  In  this  respect the year underreview has repeated the experience  of earlier years.  The outstand-ing feature in  the working of the agricultural scheme of unemploy-ment insurance  from its beginning has been excess of  income  overexpenditure.   As a result, by the end of 1938, the UnemploymentFund in its agricultural account has accumulated a balance of about 2,774,000.  This is not far short of three times the present annual expenditure.   6. The comparison in the last paragraph of income and expen-diture in  1938 has to be adjusted  in  two  ways if it is desired todetermine how agricultural income  and expenditure on the present basis of the scheme are likely to  compare over a period of years.  7. First, as is stated in paragraph 2 the rate of agriculturalcontributions  of most insured persons was reduced by \d. a week from each party as from 4th July, 1938, while on the other hand thescheme was extended to certain classes of outdoor domestic servantsas from 4th April, 1938.  We estimate that  if these  changes  hadbeen in operation throughout the year, and allowance is made fora higher rate of unemployment as suggested in the next paragraph,the total  income for the year would have been  about  1,820,000.The reduction in contribution income, for the reasons set out in
paragraphs 34 and 35 below, involves a consequential reduction of administrative  expenditure by  about   15,000 a  year to  about 220,000.  8. Second, 1938 was a year of good trade and of less than averageunemployment, in which the general account, like the agriculturalaccount, has had a surplus of income.  Exactly how agriculturalunemployment  and the finance of the agricultural account will beaffected by the trade cycle it is impossible to  say.  Among  work-people insured under the agricultural scheme  the rate of unemploy-ment during 1938  has been  5&apos;5 Per  cent.   Among workpeopleinsured under the general scheme, the rate of  unemployment during1938 has been 12-6 per cent, as compared with an expected meanrate, taking good and bad  years together,  of 15-1 per cent.  Thatis to say, in adjusting the finance of the general scheme, it is assumed that the mean rate of unemployment  over a trade cycle will be about one-fifth,  or 20 per cent.,  above that experienced in 1938.  on general grounds it is likely that agricultural employment will beaffected by cyclical fluctuation less violently than industrial employ-ment.   On the other hand,  the agricultural scheme is still something of a novelty;  it is likely that, as agricultural  workers becomefamiliar with the machinery of insurance, the claims on the agricul-tural account will tend to  rise.  On a balance of considerations itappears to us prudent to allow for  agriculture, taking good yearsand bad years together, a rate of unemployment 25 per cent,  above that experienced in 1938.  A proportionate increase of 25 per cent.on the current rate of expenditure on agricultural benefit  wouldbe  185,000  a  year,  making  the average annual  expenditure onbenefit  927,000 and the total expenditure on  agricultural accountabout  1,164,000 per annum.   9. The real gap,  accordingly, between  agricultural income andexpenditure,  on  the  present conditions  and  experience, is  that between  1,820,000 and  1,164,000, that is to say  656,000 a year.That is prima  facie the  excess of resources  over liabilities, afterthe adjustments referred to in the preceding paragraphs.  10. To  what  is  the  difference  between  expected and  actual expenditure on benefit  in  agriculture to be attributed ?  To someextent it is due to unemployment in agriculture having proved lessthan was  allowed for.  To  some extent it is due to the fact that, ofthis  smaller unemployment, a larger proportion than was expectedis that of women, having  lower rates of benefit  than men.  To amuch larger extent it is due to the fact that so small a proportionof the  unemployment which does occur ranks  for benefit.  Duringthe year 1938 the proportion of unemployment in agriculture rankingfor agricultural benefit has  been 48 per cent, for males, 60 per cent.for females,  and 50 per cent, for both sexes together.  This is con-siderably  lower  than the proportion in the general scheme  (now    a  093                                                B 4
about 60 per cent.).  It is considerably lower also than the expecta-&apos;tions  and  intentions  with which the  agricultural  scheme was established.  11.  The unexpectedly small proportion of the total unemploymentthat has ranked for benefit hitherto is a feature of the agriculturalscheme  second only in importance to  the  excess of income overexpenditure.   It will clearly be a matter of importance to discoverjust what forces are operating to keep the percentage ranking inagriculture as  low as it is, and which are the types of employees atpresent  excluded.   We  hope that,  before it  becomes necessaryfor  us to make a further financial report on the agricultural scheme,it will have been possible by means of enquiries made through theMinistry of  Labour, or otherwise, to  throw light on  this problem.The unemployed men  insured tinder  the agricultural scheme whofail to draw benefit under it cannot, to any large extent, be drawingbenefit under the general scheme, while many of them are clearly in need of an income, since the number of agricultural workers receivingallowances from the unemployment^nent Assistance Board  is substantial.  12.  Whatever the cause of the low  percentage of unemploymentin agriculture  that is now covered by  insurance, it is  difficult to be content with  the result.  In an industry with unemployment aslow as 7 per cent., a scheme which provides for no more than half that unemployment cannot be regarded as fulfilling the purpose of insurance.  It may be  that the  percentage ranking for benefit  will rise automatically  under the existing rules  determining  the periodof benefit,  as  men  accumulate  more  and  more contributions.  Itmay be that some amendment of these rules will become necessaryto  bring about  such a rise.   In any  case, it  appears to  us thatcovering of a  larger proportion of the total unemployment than atpresent should be regarded as one of the essential purposes of theagricultural insurance scheme.   That  is to say,  we should assume that the rate  of expenditure ultimately experienced by the scheme will be based  not upon a 50 per cent, proportion ranking but on amuch higher proportion,  such as 70 per cent.  13.  An increase  of the percentage  ranking for benefit to  about70 per cent, would make the average annual expenditure on benefitabout   1,298,000   a year  in   place  of  the  figure  of  927,000named above.  The  total  expenditure,  after  allowing  for  thereduction in the charge for administration referred to in paragraph above, would  be  1,535,000.  We should reckon our liabilities onthe latter basis, as  the  figure  to which, by suitable adjustments(if necessary) in the rules regulating the period of benefit, we expectand desire that expenditure should  rise.  The  difference between 1,820,000 (our assumed average income) and  1,535,000 is  285,000.That is the maximum that we should regard as available for imme-diate  distribution in any way  other  than  by  the  changes of the
ratio rule or other extensions of the period of benefit.  Even this,having regard to the scale of the agricultural scheme, is a substantialdisposable surplus.  In addition there is the balance already accumu-lated in excess of any probable requirements to meet depression.                         Representations.   14. In accordance  with section 59 of the Act  of  1935 we gavenotice in the Press, and by direct communication to the principalassociations of employers and employees in the agricultural industry,of our intention to make  a report on the financial condition of theUnemployment  Fund in  respect  of  its agricultural account.  Inthis communication we called attention both to the excess of incomeover  expenditure and to the  low  percentage of unemploymentranking for benefit, and we invited special comment upon the latter point.  We received oral evidence  in  respect  of the  agriculturalaccount from the National Farmers&apos; Union (in  England), from theNational Farmers&apos; Union and Chamber  of Agriculture for Scotland,from  the Trades Union Congress General Council, the National Unionof Agricultural Workers,  and the Transport and  General Workers&apos;Union and  its  Scottish  Farm  Servants&apos;  Section.  We receivedrepresentations  also from the Ministry  of Agriculture and fisheries and from the Department of Agriculture for Scotland.   15. The  representatives of  the employers emphasized the viewthat employment conditions were still far from normal and urgedthat having regard to the short experience  of the scheme it wouldbe undesirable to make drastic changes in it.  They suggested inwriting that if there were a sufficient disposable surplus this shouldbe used to reduce contributions.  In oral evidence, they expressedthe view that they would have no objection to a moderate increaseof benefits.   16. The  representatives of the employees submitted a memoran-dum containing  a number of proposals for improvement of benefits,including  abolition of the  three  days&apos; waiting period,  giving of cash benefits between  14 and 16 years of age to boys and girls who now receive no such benefit, increase of rates of  benefit  by varyingamounts in each of the other sex and age classes (the  proposition inrespect of  the largest  class namely men over  21 being a rise of. a week from  14s. to  16s.), increase of the adult dependants&apos;allowance from  7s. to 8s., and the removal of the present limit of30s. a week as the maximum benefit that can be drawn. They statedthat none of those whom they represented favoured  a reduction ofcontributions;  on the contrary agricultural workers would prefer,if  necessary, to  pay higher contributions in order to secure  higherbenefits.
  17- The representatives of the agricultural Departments advocatedin the first place  an increase in  benefit rates, though not on so high a scale as those proposed by  the employees;  they did so withthe express object of increasing the attractiveness of agricultural work and so checking the drift  of men from the land.  They com-bined with  this recommendation a proposal for the raising of thelimit on maximum benefit.  They  agreed that if after these changeshad been made, funds were still disposable, it would be reasonable to reduce contributions.                 Disposal  of  Current  Surplus.   18.  In considering the question of an increase of rates of benefit in the agricultural scheme, it is not in our view possible, nor indeed would it be in the interests of the employees themselves, to leave out, as has been  suggested in some quarters that we  should leave out, the consideration of wages.   We have already expressed the view in an earlier report that unemployment insurance is insurance against the loss  of wages.   The case both for  an increase in benefit rates and for the removal, or raising, of the present maximum limit upon total benefit, was argued by those who put it forward largely on the ground that  since the scheme  was started, wages  in agriculture had advanced materially. We asked the Ministry of Labour accordingly to supply us with such  information  as they could about  wages in agriculture and their course in recent years.  We print the  memo- randum  supplied in  Appendix  D.   The main  results of this  raerao- randum  may be summed up as follows : From  31st  March,  1936 (just  before  the introduction  of the agricultural scheme) to  30th November,  1938, there  have  been  substantial  increases  in  the minimum rates of wages in practically all parts of the  country. The smallest  increase is is., recorded in one county of Wales, and the largest is 4s. recorded in one county of England; the commonest increases are 2s.  6d., or 3s. a week.   The average  increase, whether reckoned by counties or in  accordance with  the  number of adult male workers employed in each area, is about 2s. jd. a week.  19.  The minimum wages do not represent the  whole  annual earnings  even of those who  are paid  at these rates, and many men of all classes are paid more.  There are large classes paid considerably more.  As far as it is possible to give a  single figure for the average wage  of  all agricultural  workers in England and Wales, the most defensible figure for 1936 is one of 35s. gd. a week.  If it be assumed that  since 1936 total earnings  have  risen in the same proportion as the weekly minimum  for agricultural workers, the correspondingaverage total earnings in 1938  would be about 38s. gd., or a rise of3s. a week.   These two figures  of 35s. gd. and 38s. gd. are estimatesonly,  but they are estimates prepared  with care  and are  the  bestguide  that we can get for our  action at present.  In Scotland the
increases in the past three years have been rather greater than the increases in England and Wales, and the current wages in Scotlandcompare favourably with those in the rest of the country.  20. The average  wage of insured applicants  under the generalscheme, as shown in our last report, is about 55s. 6d.  From thesefigures it appears that the  rates of benefit now  in force under theagricultural scheme are much nearer to the wages normally earnedthan is the case in the general scheme.  A man with wife and threechildren  receives when unemployed  36s.  a  week in the generalscheme,  as  compared  with  the average  wage  of  55s.  6d.  an agricultural worker in the same position gets 30s. as compared withan  average  wage  of just  under 39s. Considered  accordingly  ascompensation  for loss of wages, insurance under the agriculturalscheme is already on a more generous scale than under the generalscheme.  This, however, arises essentially from the  relatively low wages  in agriculture.   It  was  common  ground among  all  thosewho made representations before us that we  ought  to contemplatean increase in the  remuneration of agricultural workers as a meansof preventing the further continued drift from the land into industrialeihployment.  In the light of these considerations we believe thatthe case for an  increase of benefits under the agricultural schemeis made out and we make the following proposals accordingly.                                         Weekly rate of                                         Benefit to be         Class of Insured Persons           increased      Men aged 21 and under 65   ...  from 14s. to  15s.  ,  -      Young men aged 18 and under         21     ...     ...    ...     ...  from 12s. to  13s.      Boys aged 17 and under 18   ...  from 6s. to 7s. 6d.      Boys aged 16 and under 17   ...  from 4s. to 5s.      Women aged 21 and under 65   from 12s. 6d. to 13s.      Young  women  aged 18 and         under 21     ...    ...     ...  from 9s. 6d.  to 10s.      Girls aged 17 and under  18   ...  from 5s. to 6s.      Girls aged 16 and under  17   ...  from 3s. 6d.  to 4s.      Benefit for an adult dependant  from 7s. to 9s.  21. These proposals will  mean,  for every  adult  married maleworkman, an increase of 3S. in the  weekly rate of benefit.  This isthe same as he would have got under the proposals put before us bythe trade union representatives, though it is made up in a differentWA3&apos;, by adding is. to the benefit of the man (in place of 2s. as pro-posed by the trade unions), and 2s. to the benefit for adult dependants(in  place of  is.  as proposed by  them).   The increases  which we propose in  other classes are  generally smaller than the  proposals ofthe trade unions, though there is  some increase in all cases.  We
are not satisfied that a case is made out for the complete abolitionof the waiting period, and we make no proposition for benefit tcMboys and girls under 16.  Their inclusion in the insurance schemefor contributions without benefit was a deliberate decision of  policy by Parliament;  this should not be changed without a full considera-tionof the educational and other issues involved.  .22. Raising of the rates of benefit in the manner proposed  by us,for men with dependants,  involves in otir view the raising  of themaximum,limit of benefit.   We propose that this limit should beraised by 3s.  to 33s. a  week, so that it will continue  to affect thesame class of persons as are now affected by it.   While we think itdesirable to raise the limit in order to avoid extending its operation,we are  bound to&apos; point out  that the increase  proposed is  more,rather than less,  than the  average increase of minimum  wagesthroughout. the country, and that  it will establish a  benefit limit which for many counties is very high in relation to the minimum wage.   In the 49 county areas of England and Wales there were, inNovember, 1938, 10 with minimum wages at 33s. or less, 4 at 33s. 6d.and 8 at 34s.  23. We estimate that the  foregoing proposals will  increase theexpenditure of the Fund, assuming both the increase of unemploy-ment and the  increase in  the  proportion ranking  indicated  inparagraphs  8  and  12 above, by about  125,000 a year.  This will still leave something like  160,000  a year as a  disposable surplus.This is  the  surplus which remains after  providing for extension inall  directions, by  an increase of unemployment,  by an increase inthe proportion ranking for benefit, and by substantial improvements in the rates of benefit.   There appears to be no possibility of absdrb-ing this surplus in  any reasonable further increases of rates of benefit,or  in improvements of the  conditions  of benefit,  which we  areprepared  to  recommend.  In the  circumstances,  we  think it is right  to conclude  that the finance of the  agricultural scheme  as originally framed,  though not unduly cautious  having regard  tothe scanty data available, has proved in fact to be too conservative.We believe that it would be reasonable to use the remaining surplus in a reduction of contributions, and we propose accordingly that thecontributions  of men aged 21 and under 65, of young  men aged 18and under 21, of women aged 21 and under 65, and of young womenaged 18 and under 21, should in all cases be reduced by -id. a week from each party.  These changes are estimated to reduce the income of the agricultural account  by  190,000  a year.  Incidentally  theywill reduce  by one-eighth of that sum, that is to say by  23,750 ayear, the sum charged to the account as expenditure for adminis-tration.  The net cost accordingly  to the  agricultural  account ofthe reduction of contributions proposed is  about  166,000  a year,which is practically the same as the sum of  160,000 a year  namedabove as still  disposable.
                     Rebates for Long Hirings.   24.  There is one further saving to the agricultural account which we hope to see realised, though for the reasons given below we do not feel justified in seeking to  bring it about directly by financial Order.  This is a possible saving in respect of the provision made by Section 10 of the Unemployment Insurance (Agriculture) Act, 1936, for refunding part of the contributions paid, where men have been engaged under yearly or  half-yearly  contracts.  Such contracts, described hereinafter as long hirings, are common for certain classes of agricultural employees in Scotland and, to a less extent, in the North of England.  In our report last year we pointed out that the number of  long hirings for which rebate of contributions had been claimed had been much below expectations.  We added that,  in view of the heavy administrative expense involved in giving rebates, it might soon  become a question for consideration  whether  the system of rebates was worth while.   25. We have now been furnished by the Ministry of Labour with a memorandum setting out fully the working of this provision of the agricultural insurance scheme,  with estimates of the cost involved. The  gist of this  memorandum is that the administrative cost of giving the  rebates appreciably  exceeds the amount of  the rebates themselves. The  estimate of  the Ministry  of  Labour  is that,  in order to return a sum of just  under  10,000 a year as rebates to particular employers and employees, it is necessary to incur expen- diture on administration, that is to say, on the time of clerical and other officers and on stationery, postage,  travelling and on other items, of about  12,000 a year.   These figures by themselves make it difficult to justify continuing the system of rebates.   26. The  origin  of the system is to be found in a proposal made by  ourselves  in  our report of  December,  1934,  upon which the &apos; agricultural insurance scheme was based.   In that report, however, we recommended that the concession which we  thought -reasonable in respect of long hirings should be given, not by a refund of contribu- tions already paid, but by the introduction of  a special stamp for six months&apos; or twelve months&apos; contributions, to be affixed in advance. Obviously such a system would have involved far less administrative expenditure than  the giving of rebates.  The Ministry  of  Labour, however, after considering our recommendation, came to  the  con- clusion that the use of special stamps for long hirings was impracticable- able  and that  the reduction of  contributions could only  be made by way of rebate.  It was in this form that reduction of contributions&quot; for  long  hirings  was embodied  in  the  legislation  establishing agricultural unemployment insurance.   27. We are not in a position to question the view of the Ministry of Labour  that our proposal, in the form in which it was made, was
                              i8impracticable.  But even if there appeared to be any hope of mater-ially reducing the  administrative  cost  of  giving  this concession,the reason which led us to propose the concession has ceased to bevalid.  When in 1934 we were considering the question of unemploy-ment insurance in agriculture, it was urged upon us by the represen-tatives of the farmers in Scotland that it would be unfair to extendunemployment insurance to Scotland on  the same terms in regard tocontributions as to England.  They argued  that the risk of agricul-tural unemployment  was  materially less  in  Scotland than inEngland.  On the data then before us (secured through a question in the ordinary census) we raised some doubt as to the claim that agricultural  unemployment in Scotland was materially less than inother parts of Great Britain.  These data suggested that, taking allclasses of agriculturalists together, there was little difference betweenthe two countries; according to  our estimate, the rate of unemploy-ment in England and Wales  was higher than that in  Scotland onlyin the proportion 11 to  10.  The  actual working  of agricultural  unemployment  insuranceshows that, so far from Scotland having  a lower risk of agriculturalunemployment than England, it has a higher risk.  The unemploy-ment percentages for 1937 and 1938 have been as follows : Farming, Forestry,  etc.Market  Gardening, horticulture-  ture, etc.Other  Gardening   (excluding  Private gardening)1937             1938England		England	and	Scotland	and	ScotlandW ales		W ales	4-0	4-8	5-5	6-45-i	12-0	7-1	15-43-6	6-8	4-2	7-0  It may be of interest to add that the experience of the North ofEngland,  in which also long hirings  are  common,  confirms theexperience of Scotland that this system does not lead to a low rate ofunemplo3&apos;ment  among  agricultural workers as  a whole.   In theNorthern Division of England the unemployment percentage amonginsured persons engaged in farming and forestry was 7-0 in 1937 and-5 in 1938, as compared with the percentages  of 4-0 and 5-5 given above for England and Wales as a whole.   28. The giving of special discounts for long hirings which took offthe risk of unemployment from the Fund for six  months or a year at atime was recommended by us in 1934 as being &quot; in our view the best way of meeting the claim put forward on behalf  of the farmers inScotland either for exclusion from insurance or for special treatment.&quot;But this  greater temporary security of employment for some of the employees is now  shown to be  accompanied by a rate of unemploy-ment among other workers in the same industry so high that the
53unemployment percentage  over all  employees taken  together  is actually higher in Scotland and in the North of England than it is inEngland and Wales as a whole.   The claim of the Scottish farmers tocome into the insurance scheme on more favourable terms than theEnglish farmers loses its justification.   In these  circumstances, itdoes not appear to us worth while to explore the possibility of being able to give a reduction of contributions for long hirings by some method costing less in administration than that now in force.  We areof opinion that the system itself should not be continued.   29.  We  should add that in  preparing  this report we invitedexpressions of opinion from representatives of agricultural employees and employers as to the desirability of continuing the rebates for longhirings.  The representatives of the agricultural trade unions, both inEngland and in Scotland,  expressed  themselves as opposed to therebates.  The National Farmers&apos; Union  in  England expressed  nostrong  opinion.  The National  Farmers&apos;  Union  and  Chamber  ofAgriculture for Scotland, while  recognizing that the administrativecost of the rebates made them hard to justify, thought that a reduc-tion of contributions for long hirings should continue in some form or another.  Finally, we may add  that,  since the  agricultural schemewas established, the contributions of emploj^ers have been reduced bya  id. per man per week (representing   60,000  a  year)  and that afurther reduction is proposed in this report.   30. Section 10 of the Unemployment  Insurance  (Agriculture) Act,1936, which provides  for reduced contributions in yearly or half-yearly hirings, is included in the Fourth Schedule of that Act amongthe provisions of which amendments may be recommended  by theUnemployment Insurance  Statutory Committee,  in adjusting thefinance of the agricultural scheme.  But, in our view, our power toamend section  10 should not be interpreted as  a  power directly or indirectly to abolish  the section  altogether.   We have given reasonsfor concluding that the rebates for long hirings should be abolished,and they can now be abolished, without hardship to anybody, as  anaccompaniment to the reduction of contributions which we propose.But, as a matter of constitutional practice, we believe that a provisionintroduced  so recently by  Parliament  should  not be  rescinded,directly or indirectly, without full parliamentaiy procedure. We hopethat an early opportunity will be taken of any  legislation affectingunemployment insurance, to include in  such legislation  a clauserepealing section  10  of the  Unemployment Insurance  (Agriculture)Act, 1936.                      Accumulated  Reserve.  31.  There remains for consideration the question of dealing withthe reserve that has already been accumulated.  This stands now at 2,774,000,  and is  increasing steadily.  Even  on the  view  taken
53 unemployment  percentage over all employees  taken together is actually higher in Scotland and in the North of England than it is in England and Wales as a whole.  The claim of the Scottish farmers to come into the insurance scheme on more favourable terms than the English farmers loses its  justification.  In these circumstances, it does not appear to us worth while to explore the possibility of being able to give a reduction of contributions  for long hirings by some method costing less in administration than that now in force.  We are of opinion that the system itself should not be continued.   29.  We should add  that  in  preparing this  report we invited expressions of opinion from representatives of agricultural employees and employers as to the desirability of continuing the rebates for long hirings.   The representatives of the agricultural trade unions, both in England  and in Scotland, expressed themselves as opposed to the rebates.  The National Farmers&apos; Union in England  expressed no strong  opinion.  The National  Farmers&apos;  Union and Chamber of Agriculture for  Scotland, while recognizing that the administrative cost of the rebates made them hard to justify, thought that a reduc- tion of contributions for long hirings should continue in some form or another.  Finally, we may add that, since the  agricultural scheme was established, the contributions of employers have been reduced by a  Id. per man per week (representing  60,000 a year) and that  a further reduction is proposed  in this report.   30. Section 10 of the Unemployment Insurance (Agriculture) Act, 1936, which provides for  reduced  contributions in yearly or  half- yearly hirings, is included in the Fourth Schedule of that Act among the provisions of which amendments may be recommended by the Unemployment  Insurance Statutory Committee, in adjusting the finance of the agricultural scheme.   But, in our view,  our  pow7er to amend section 10 should not  be interpreted as a power directly or indirectly to abolish  the section altogether.  We have given reasons for concluding that the rebates for long hirings should be abolished, and they can now be  abolished, without hardship to anybody, as an accompaniment  to the reduction of contributions which we propose. But, as a matter of constitutional practice, we believe that a provision introduced so recently  by Parliament  should  not  be  rescinded, directly or indirectly,  without full parliamentaiy procedure.  We hope that an early opportunity, will be taken of any legislation  affecting unemployment insurance  to  include  in such legislation  a  clause repealing  section 10  of the Unemployment Insurance  (Agriculture) Act, 1936.                       A ccnmidaled Reserve.  31. There remains  for consideration the  question of dealing  withthe reserve that  has already been accumulated.  This stands now at 2,774,000,  and is increasing  steadily.  Even  on the view taken
above as. to what should be the annual expenditure of the agriculturalscheme, it will shortly exceed twice the annual expenditure.  Thereis no justification for keeping so large a reserve.   32. In the general scheme we have been able to dispose of lump sum surpluses by spreading them over short periods of years, because we were working on the assumption that the trend of unemployment was  downward.  We have now a second means of disposal of lumpsums, in paying off debt.   In the agricultural scheme neither of these methods is open to us.   33. The only  means of disposing of a  lump sum surplus  in theagricultural account is by an improvement of benefits or reduction ofcontributions, which both in form  and in substance  shall be made only for a limited^time  and shall then stop.  Practically this means areduction of contributions made for a specific limited period.  we propose accordingly that, in addition to  the   d. a week reductionwhich we  recommend from our current  disposable  surplus, there-should be a reduction of another -id. for the same classes of contribu-tors,  limited  to the next three years.   The net cost of this,  to theagricultural account, is  166,000 a year ; if  the Fund in other respectsbalances, it would involve reducing our present accumulation in theagricultural account by about  500,000.  It  is a simple means  of returning to  the industry past contributions in excess  of require-ments.   34. In making this proposal of a  reduction limited to three years,we do not of course affect the powers given to us by the Act to recom-mend changes in the finance of the agricultural scheme, including therates of contribution, at any time when this appears to be necessary.Our  proposal, as formulated in paragraph 37 below, does not mean that  no further  changes, upwards  or  downwards, can be  made  incontribution rates before July, 1942.   It  means that if our recom-mendations are accepted and contributions are now reduced by id.a  week from each party,  for the principal classes of contributors,the rates of contribution will rise again automatically by -id. a week from each party in July, 1942, if no further Order is made about them.                           Conclusion.   35. In summing up  the financial results of  the various proposalswhich we make in this  report, we have to call attention to the effectof the arrangement whereby the sum charged to the agriculturalaccount, as the cost of administering the agricultural scheme, is fixed,not by reference to the administrative expenditure actually incurred,but as a proportion of the income of the agricultural account.  Undersection 9 of the  Unemployment Insurance (Agriculture)  Act, 1936,the sum charged to the agricultural account for administration maynot exceed one-eighth  of the contribution income of that  account.
In practice the charge made has been one-eighth of the contribution income.  This practice gives effect to a recommendation made  by ourselves in paragraph 133 of our report of December, 1934, where we suggested that &quot; at  least for the first five  years the cost ofadministration charged to the agricultural scheme should be i/&apos;8th ofthe  agricultural  contribution income.&quot;   We added that &quot; at theend  of that time it will be possible to determine whether a detailedallocation of costs is desirable.&quot;   In view of the difficulties at thebeginning of agricultural insurance, both of judging the kind and thecost of administration that  would  be  required,  and of allocatingadministrative expenditure as between  the general and the agricul-tural accounts, the practice adopted hitherto has great convenience.  36. But  this  arrangement, however  convenient,  has incidentaleffects which complicate in unexpected ways the  finance of theinsurance schemes.  In the first place, any reduction of agriculturalcontributions automatically reduces the sum  charged to the  agri-cultural  account  for administration, and throws a correspondingadditional  burden on the general  account.   Thus the proposals made above to  reduce the contribution income  of  the agriculturalaccount in the next three years by  380,000 a year, simultaneouslyrelieves that account of a charge of  47,500 a year for administration and  adds this charge  to the liabilities  of the  general account.  Inthe second place,  the special expenditure involved in administering the provision for long hirings, excessive as it is, falls, in effect, not onthe  agricultural account, but  on the general account.  If, as  we hope, the rebate, for long hirings is abolished, the agricultural accountwill  gain by having  10,000 a year of additional contributions, lessan additional  1,250 which  will then  be added to its  charge  for administration,  while the general account will benefit both by the dropping of the  12,000 a year  of actual administrative cost thatis now incurred, and by transference of  1,250 a year from general to agricultural charges. In the third place, the fact that reduction ofagricultural contributions automatically reduces agricultural adminis-trative expenditure, makes it difficult,  without special explanation,to show the real effect of our various proposals.  Actually, as stated above, we are proposing to increase expenditure on benefits by about 125,000 a year,  but as our accompanying proposal  to  reducecontributions automatically reduces the expenditure of the agricul-tural account on  another item, namely administration,  the net increase  of agricultural account expenditure is not  125,000 a  year,but about  78,000 a year for the next three years and about  101,000a  year thereafter. It is in this form that we are bound formally topresent the effect  of our proposals on the expenditure of the agricul-tural account. As is stated in paragraph 35, the present arrangement regard to costs of administration  was- proposed by us as  an experiment  for  five years, and  should be regarded  as  subject to revision at the end of that time.
  37- We conclude this our Third Report on the financial conditionof the Unemployment Fund in respect of its agricultural account :        (i) By reporting formally under Section 59 (2) of the Unem-    ployment Insurance Act of 1935 and Section 8 of the Unemploy-    ment Insurance (Agriculture) Act, 1936, that the Unemployment    Fund in respect of its agricultural account is, and is likely to    continue to be, more than reasonably sufficient to  discharge its    liabilities.       (2) By recommending as changes required to make the Fund    in respect of its agricultural account not more than reasonably    sufficient:            (i) that in  the Second  Schedule of the Unemployment         Insurance  (Agriculture) Act, 1936, as amended by  the        -Unemployment Insurance (Additional Benefits and Reduc-         tion in Contributions)  (Agriculture)  Order,  1938,  dated         25th March,  1938,               for 4d. as the weekly rate of  contribution by  the            employed person and by the employer in the case of            men who have attained the age of 21  years  there            should be substituted  3d.  as from  3rd July,  1939,            until 6th July,  1942, and 3^d. thereafter;               for 3Id. as the weekly rate of  contribution by  the            employed person  and  the  employer in  the  case of            women who have attained the age of 21 and in  the            case of young  men between  the ages  of 18 and 21            there should be  substituted 2-l-d. as from  3rd  July,            1939, until 6th  July, 1942, and 3d. thereafter;               for 3d. as the weekly rate of  contribution by  the            employed person and by the employer in the case of            young women  between the ages  of 18 and  21  there            should be substituted  2d. as  from 3rd  July,  1939,            until 6th July,  1942, and 2^-d. thereafter;           (ii)  that  in the Third Schedule of the Unemployment        Insurance (Agriculture) Act,  1936, as  amended  by the        Unemployment Insurance  (Additional  Benefits and Reduc-        tion  in Contributions)  (Agriculture)  Order,  1938, dated        25th March, 1938, there should be substituted for the rates        of benefit now in force, set out  in column (2)  below, in        respect of the various classes of contributors set out in        column (1), the rates specified in column (3).Col.

(3) By estimating that these recommendations will decrease    the income of the Fund on the agricultural account by approxi-    mately  380,000 a year for the three years beginning 3rd July,    1939, and by  190,000 a year thereafter, and will increase the    expenditure  of  the Fund on the agricultural account  by ap-    proximately   78,000 a  year  for  the  first  three years,  and     101,000 a year thereafter.  In  presenting this report it is necessary  for us who sign it torefer to the heavy loss which we as a Committee, and all the causesthat the Committee was  intended to serve, have  suffered by therecent sudden death of Mr. Arthur Shaw.  As  a member of the Unemployment Insurance Statutory Com-mittee from its  beginning,  and, before  that,  of the  AnomaliesAdvisory Committee, to some of whose duties the Statutory Com-mittee succeeded, Mr. Shaw by his experience, by his abilities  andby his personality had rendered services which were invaluable, and
had secured the respect and affection of all of us.  To the preparationof this Third Agricultural Report and the Sixth General report which precedes it, he had contributed his usual full share in dis-cussion and his agreement in the conclusions.  But for his untimelydeath, he would have joined with  us in signing both these reports.Missing  his familiar  name, we  realize most clearly how  much our deliberations have owed to him and how much weaker we are leftby his loss.              We have the honour to be, Sir,                           Your obedient servants,                             W. H.

                              APPENDIX D.                          WAGES IN AGRICULTURE.  The principal  sources of  information regarding  agricultural  wages  inEngland and Wales are the Orders made by the Agricultural Wages Boardfixing minimum rates of wages for male workers in agriculture.   For thispurpose the country  is divided into 49 areas, and minimum wage rates are fixed for each  area  separately.  In some areas only one  minimum  rate is fixed for adult male workers, with provision for overtime  rates for workin excess of a specified  number of hours.  In a number of areas, however,minimum rates are also fixed for special classes of workers, such as horsemenand stockmen, these rates being usually payable in respect of hours longer than those  to  which the minimum rate for ordinary workers  applies.   InTable 1 figures are given showing, for each of  the 49 areas, the minimum rates of  wages  for  ordinary adult male  workers at 31st  March,  1936(just before the extension of  unemployment insurance to agriculture) and30th November, 1938,  as  fixed by the Agricultural Wages  Board.  Thefigures  are inclusive  of  the  value  of  certain &quot; perquisites,&quot; and employers are authorised to  make deductions, at stipulated  rates,  in respect of boardand lodging or other specific allowances.  The lowest minimum rates fixed are those for Merionetli  and Montgomery-shire, viz., 28s. 6d. in March,  1936, and 31s. 6d.  in November, 1938. Thehighest minima are  in Northern  Lancashire (36s.  6d. in  March, 1936, and39s. 6d. in November, 1938).  For England and Wales as  a  whole the averageminimum has risen in the same period  from 31s. n d. to 34s. 7d., or  by2s.  7M. per week.  As regards  Scotland, legal minimum rates of  wages were fixed  in 1938for the  first time under the Agricultural  Wages  (Regulation) (Scotland) Act,&apos;937J !m(t these rates became operative  in the different districts at variousdates between July and September. Some particulars are available, however,of the wages paid in previous  years, and in  Tables 2 and 3 figures are givenshowing for  each  of the 11  areas into  which Scotland is divided for thepurposes of the Act (a) the  average  weekly wages  (including the value of allowances)  for each of five classes of workers  at Whit-Sunday,  1935, andWhit-Sunda3&apos;,  1938,  as ascertained by the  Department of Agriculture  forScotland, and  (b)  the minimum rates of wages in operation  at November,1938, as fixed by  the Scottish Agricultural Wages Board.  These figures show that the increases in Scotland in the past three years have been rathergreater than the increases in England and Wales, and the current wages inScotland compare favourably with those  in England and Wales.  All the figures for England and Wales  and the current figures for Scotlandare, of course, minima, and it is possible that the actual rates of remunerationmay be appreciably different, particularly  in  the  case  of horsemen  andstockmen, wdiose hours usually exceed the normal week.  Very little infOrma-tion. is available as to the actual wages being paid, but the following extractfrom the Ministry of Agriculture^  &quot; Agricultural Statistics&quot; for 1936 givessome indication of the comparison between  minimum rates and actual ratesin England and Wales in that  year.       &quot; As regards  the  actual earnings of agricultural workers,  although     no precise statistics are  available, some particulars in this respect arc     obtained by the Ministry&apos;s Inspectors in the course of  their duties in the     enforcement of the minimum rates.  Such  particulars are  obtained, to     a large  extent, - from workers  on farms at which  investigations have     been made following complaints as  to non-observance of the minimum     rates and, therefore, since the number of  investigations varies considerably
    in different parts  of the country, the averages calculated on this data    are submitted  only  as  an illustration of the difference between actual    wages and the minimum rates and must not be taken as an authoritative    estimate of actual  wage levels over the country as a whole.      The calculations in question show  that, on the  basis of the figures    obtained, the  average  total  earnings of  ordinary  male workers were    34s. yd.  per week, while for horsemen and stockmen the averages were    37s. 4d.  and 39s.  8d. per week respectively.   In view  of the limitation    of the information upon  which  these averages are  based and for  the    reasons already mentioned, comparison  of the estimates with those for    previous j&apos;ears would be  unreliable.   It  may be  stated, however, that    estimates for  previous  years  would appear to indicate that there have    been no  very  wide fluctuations in the average earnings.  In the case of    ordinary workers  the estimates have ranged over the  previous 9 years    from a maximum  of 33s.  nd. in 1931 to a minimum of 32s. 8d. in 1933,    while the average earnings of horsemen have ranged  from 37s. 5d. in    1929 and 1930 to  36s. 6d. in 1933 and of stockmen from 39s. 5c!. in 1931    to 38s. 6d. in 1933.&quot;  On the basis of these figures for average total earnings in the three mainclasses,  the weighted average  in  1936 for all workers in England  and wales would probably be between 35s.  6d. and  36s.  If total  earnings  have risensince 1936  in  the same proportion as the  average  weekly  minimum for ordinary workers the corresponding average  total earnings  in 1938 would be between 38s. 6d. and 39s., showing a rise of about 3s.  Information is not available as to the extent to which the average actualearnings in Scotland exceed the statutory minimum rates of wages  shown inTable 3.Recent changes  in Rates of Wages.  As  stated above, the average of the minimum rates of wages for ordinaryagricultural labourers  in England and Wales rose from 31s. njd. in 1936 to34s. 7d. in 1938, or approximately 8 per cent.  At the end  of January, 1939,the average was 34s. 7-id.  In Scotland, the average weekly  rates of wages,inclusive of the estimated value of allowances in kind, as shown in Table 2,rose by amounts varying from 3s.  9d. to 8s., in different occupations, betweenWhitsun, 1935, and Whitsun,  1938. Comparable figures are not available forany later date, but there have probably  been further  increases  in rates ofwages in some  cases as a result of the recent Orders fixing  minimum rates ofwages.Ministry of Labour.
