THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT&quot;.             ACCESS TO MOUNTAINS BILL.       Memorandum  by  the Minister of Agriculture       and  the  Secretary of  State for Home  Affairs.    .  1.    This Bill, which  was introduced  by Mr.  Creech Jones (Labour Member for Shipley) on behalf of English  Rambling Associations, was considered by the Cabinet on 30th  November, 1938, when it was agreed that it should be blocked,  (Cab. 57(38) conclusion 19) but it received Second Reading on the 2nd December, and is to be  taken in Standing Committee on Tuesday, 7th March.      2.    As introduced, the Bill gave a right of access for recreational purposes to all uncultivated  mountain, heath, moorland or  downland, and afforded no adequate safeguards to the landowners.   On Second Reading it was at first opposed by representatives of landowners.   The supporters of the Bill  admitted that it was defective, but expressed readiness to make reasonable amendments in Committee, and reference was made  to negotiations already proceeding between the Land Union, the Central Landowners Association, and the Commons and Open Spaces and Footpaths Preservation Society, with a view to reaching agreement upon proposals that access to  uncultivated lands  should be legalised,   subject to provisions  based upon section 193 of the Law of property Act, 1925.   Under this section certain restrictions are imposed under penalty upon public access &quot;to commons in urban districts and theMinister of Agriculture is  empowered tc add to them.   In rural  districts the lord of the manor can  secure  the application of the section voluntarily by  depositing a deedwith  the Minister.SECRET.CABINET.CP.57(39)
     3.    The feeling of the House was overwhelmingly in favourof the principle of the Bill and by means of discussion duringthe course of the debate with the promoters and opponents ofthe Bill the Under Secretary of State for the -Home Department,who was to speak for the Government, found that a compromisewas quite possible.   With the agreement of the Home secretary and Chief Whip, he left the Bill to a free vote, but, afterpointing out that the Bill as it stood was a bad Bill, mentionedas one possibility that - if the Bill received Second Heading -the Committee stage might be deferred to some extent in thehope .that the above mentioned negotiations might lead to anagreement which could be embodied in the Bill.   The idea was generally welcomed and on this understanding the landowners&apos;representatives withdrew their opposition and. the Pill was read a second time without a division.     4.   The negotiations resulted at the end of last week in anagreement, accepted by a great majority of the English RamblingAssociations, and this has been embodied in amendments which will result  in a very different and much longer Bill.   Only a fewwords of the original Bill are retained, and. the scope has beenenlarged so as to extend to the seashore.   Mr. Creech Jones,however, is understood to hope that the Chairman of the StandingCommittee will not object to the proposed amendments in view ofthe understanding upon which the Bill received Second. Reading.     5.   The original Bill imposed penalties for a list of offences, such as ore commonly prohibited, by by claws for commons and. open spaces.    The revised Bill extends the list considerablyand requires persons availing themselves of access to give their names and addresses,  if required., by any person authorised by thelandowner or occupier.     6.   A new clause based on the procedure embodied inSection 193 of the Law of Property Act, 1925 (which has worked
                                                         insatisfactorily) would empower landowners voluntarily tosecure the application of the Bill to specified land bydepositing a deed with the responsible department.    It  wasno doubt, this provision which secured the assent of thelandowners to the new proposals.     7.   Another clause empowers the responsible Minister on application (and after holding a public enquiry if necessary)to apply the Bill by Order to specified land (with additionalrestrictions if needed).   This proposal gets over thedifficulty of defining exactly in the Bill the land to whichit is to apply.     8.   The Bill places responsibility on the Minister ofAgriculture and Fisheries and the landowners are understood to have pressed for this.   The Bill has so far been dealt withprimarily by the Home Office, but the department possessingthe appropriate machinery for dealing with work of the kindnow envisaged seems to be the Ministry of Agriculture andFisheries.     9.   The Bill is obviously a measure of considerable public importance, and calls for very careful consideration by theGovernment.   Detailed consideration by the 7th March isimpossible.   The Bill seems to be on workable lines, but thework involved is likely to be considerable.     10.  The Minister is required to deposit with localauthorities concerned copies of deeds and orders &quot;conferringrights of access, so that they  may be available for inspectionby the general public.   They are required to be accompaniedby 6 inch maps and provision is further made for modificationfrom time to time.     11.  Applications for Orders might come from a landowner, alocal authority (including a parish council) or a ramblingassociation.   The responsible Minister is required to give
0 Onotice to local authorities and landowners concerned.   If apublic enquiry were involved the work would be greatly increased.Something might be done by amendment to put more of the burden on the applicant, who might well be expected to take allpossible steps to secure agreement before approaching the responsible department.     12.  The Bill Is framed to apply to Scotland, but it isunderstood that Scottish ramblers may ask for Scotland to be excluded.   If so, the promoters would agree.     13.  As a large measure of agreement on this  contentioussubject seems  somewhat unexpectedly to have been reached, we feel that it would be a pity to -let the opportunity  slip of enabling the general public to have Increased rights of air and exercise subject  to reasonable restrictions for preventingdamage being done to the interests of those who own  the landover which the rights are  to be granted.   We recommend,therefore, that  the Cabinet should give general approval to thenew proposals.     14.It would  seem, however, that  the  Government  spokesmen,at the  commencement of the Committee  stage  of  the  Bill,  should explain that the  Government has had  insufficient  opportunityto examine the amendments  proposed  in  the Bill,  and  that  as thenew proposals, are likely  to  Involve  considerable  labour  and increased  staff,  and consequent expense,  the Government  is bound toconsider  them  seriously  and may have  to move  amendments  at  alater  stage.                                        R.H.D.S.                                            S ,H.28th February, 1939.
