Copy No.4CP 72 (39).               TO BE  KEPT  UNDER LOCK AND  KEY.It is  requested  that  special care  may  be taken to      ensure  the  secrecy of this document.                   CABINET.CONVERSATIONS WITH THE FRENCH.               Note by Minister for Co-ordination of Defence.    AT their meeting held on the 16th March, 1939,* the Committee of ImperialDefence had under consideration the attached Memorandumt by the Secretary ofState for War in which he proposed that discussions  should take place between british and French scientists on the subject of  chemical warfare.    2.  In the course of the discussion, it was  pointed out that the  StrategicalAppreciation Sub-Committee, while examining the scope of our forthcoming staff conversations with the French, had  taken the view that on balance we stood! to gain more than we had to lose by taking the French completely into our confidencewith regard, not only to our plans, but also in the matter of such secret equipment as R.D.F. and asdics, on the grounds that, as the French were to be our allies, itwas to our advantage that they should be as effective as possible.  It was, therefore,suggested that the Committee of Imperial Defence should take the opportunityto make a decision on the  question of R.D.F. and asdics in conjunction with theproposals of the Secretary of State for War  about chemical warfare, as it seemedlogical that: the same general principle should  apply to the whole field! of our defensive preparation.    3.  The Committee of Imperial Defence, after a full discussion&apos;, agreed-   &quot; (a) to approve the  proposal of  the Secretary  of  State for  War contained           in his  Memorandum (OLD. Paper  No. 1535-B)  that there  should           be discussions between  British  and French  scientists on chemical           warfare.    (b) that  these discussions should  cover  the whole field of experimental, as           well as approved  matters, and  be conducted with Frendh civilian           scientists.  They  should  be completely  unrestricted in scope, but it           should  be stipulated that  British processes of  manufacture  should           not be  divulged.    (c) that the arrangements for (b) above should  be  the subject of negotiations           between  the  respective  representatives  at the forthcoming   Staff           Conversations.    id) to take note that the Strategical Appreciation  Sub-Committee had           reached the conclusion  that  the forthcoming  Staff Conversations           should  include  disclosure to the French  of most secret  equipment,           such  as R.D.F. and  Asdics, subject to  the stipulation that such of           our  secret equipment as the French may  desire  to  adopt must be           manufactured in this country : and to approve action on these lines.&quot;       *  351st Meeting, Minute 6.                  f O.I.D.

    4.  The Committee of Imperial  Defence recorded the following additionalconclusion    &quot; (e) that, in view of the fact that  the proposals in conclusions (a) to (d) above           to take  the  French into  our  confidence about the technical&apos; details           of R.D.F., Asdics and  gas warfare are  somewhat  in  conflict  with           the Cabinet decision quoted on page 10 of these minutes (reproduced           in footnote below), the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence should           be invited to bring conclusions  (a) to  (d) above to the  notice of the           Cabinet for  their approval:&quot;    5.  I  accordingly seek the  approval of my colleagues  to  the  conclusions reached by the Committee of. Imperial Defence as set out in paragraph 3 above.                                                       (Initialled)       C.    Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,         March 28, 1939.     [FOOTNOTE. &quot; That the Chiefs of Staff should have authority to impart tothe French such information as to our plans and resources (other than certain technical  details) as is necessary  to ensure co-ordination in peace and efficientco-operation  in war,&quot;   (Cabinet 6.

1535-B                        ANNEX         TO BE  KEPT  UNDER LOCK  AND key it IS REQUESTED THAT SPECIAL CARE MAY BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THE                 SECRECY OF THIS DOCUMENT.        COMMITTEE OF  IMPERIAL  DEFENCEDISCUSSIONS BETWEEN BRITISH AND  FRENCH SCIENTISTS                     ON CHEMICAL WARFARE    MEMORANDUM  BY THE  SECRETARY OF  STATE  FOR  WAR    i. In September,  1938, a  delegation comprising members of the Chemical   0144Defence Committee and the Chemical Defence Research Department proceeded to   7364Paris, under my. instructions, to discuss with a representative of the French war department, General Pognon, matters concerning anti-gas protection.    The main object of the interview was to find out what were the views of  theFrench Authorities on the question of protection against particulate clouds, andthe discussions were limited largely to approved matters.    2. These conversations undoubtedly served a useful purpose, and it is desiredto  continue them but  with  a much  wider scope, covering the whole  field ofexperimental as well as approved matters,  and conducted with  French civilianscientists.    3. There seem to be three methods of conducting those conversations :     (a)  Completely unrestricted in scope and conducted without any reservations.    (&amp;)  Unrestricted in scope but conducted on our side with definite reservations           as to specially secret matters.    (c)  Conversations limited to defensive problems in the first  instance.    4. With regard to (a),  we should have to disclose many experimental mattersregarded of the highest secrecy which are at present withheld from the majorityof  British  officers,  and  which   equally involve   departments other than  theWar  Office.   To communicate  these matters  to  our friends must  inevitablyincrease the  chance of their getting known to potential enemies. This woulbe  a  more serious matter  in peace  than in war, as it would give  the potential enemy  time  to  find an antidote and would  do  away with  the elements of surprise in our measures.    5. In the Appendix is  a list of specially secret items.  Of these, Items 1,  2, 3and 6 are regarded as most important for the reasons given.    6. With regard to (&amp;), it is very doubtful  whether  conversations  on such abasis would  do  any  good  and it is  even possible  that they might do harm.Experience has shown that  when scientists start discussing a subject on whichthey  are specialists, it  very quickly becomes apparent  when one or other is with-holding important information, and that thereafter  useful results can hardly beachieved.                          3E   Not  reproduced.
    7. With regard to (c), there seem to be two objections :     (i) It is difficult to keep the defensive aspect apart from the offensive  aspect,           as the one is so dependent on the other.    (ii) On the defensive side we have the impregnation process, which is regarded           as specially secret.  Knowledge of this process by a potential enemy           might  result in  his   producing a  gas against which it  would  be           ineffective.    On the other hand  we are  preparing to  go to production  on impregnatedclothing,  and in  these  circumstances it is  doubtful whether discussions withresponsible  French scientists will add appreciably to the risk  of the  processbecoming known.    8. It is desired to emphasise that if conversations are to  take place and be effective, the delegations of each country must  include civilian scientists and notbe composed of soldiers alone.    This being so, it is for consideration whether any conversations that  may beconsidered desirable should be arranged by the  respective Governments and not by the Military Departments.    9. It is now desired to obtain instructions  from the Committee of ImperialDefence whether -    (i) conversations with the French Authorities should take place, and    (ii) if approved, under which  of these methods they should be conducted.
