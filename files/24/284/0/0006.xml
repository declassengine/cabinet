THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  March  1939.SECRET.                                                         Copy No.CP. 59 (39).CABINET.THE FORM  OF  EIRE PASSPORTS.         Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.     I  THINK that my colleagues should be aware of a development which hasrecently taken place regarding the form of passports issued by the Government of eire.     2.   Hitherto these documents (which have not, I understand, been amendedsince 1936)  have borne two indications of relationship to the British Common-wealth of Nations, namely :      (a)  On  the inside of the front cover a &apos;&apos; request&apos;&apos; page  in  the following-           terms :                     &apos;&apos; We, the Minister  for  External  Affairs of the Irish Free               State, request and require, in the name of His Majesty George V               King of Great Britain, Ireland and the British Dominions beyond               the Seas,  Emperor of  India, all those whom it may concern to               allow the  bearer to pass  freely without let or hindrance, and to               afford  .... every  assistance  and  protection of  which ....               may stand in need.&quot;           This is  followed by  a facsimile  signature of the  Secretary of the           Department of External Affairs in Dublin.     (b) On  the front page, underneath the words &quot; Irish Free State &quot; (in Irish,           English and French)  appear the words &quot;British Commonwealth of           Nations.&apos;&apos;     3.   For some time it has been known that Mr. de Valera has not felt satisfied with the existing form of  passport.  In September 1937 he mentioned the matter to Mr. MacDonald  in the course of a general conversation at Geneva on Anglo-Irish relations.  Mr. de Valera then stated that the mention of the King in the passport was a matter  to which attention was frequently called  in the Irish FreeState,  and that he might  have to consider raising the question of  an alteration,though he had not yet reached a decision on the point.  Mr. MacDonald suggestedthat as passports were connected with External Relations it was proper, in accord-ance with the Irish  Free State External  Relations Act of 1936, that  the King&apos;s Name should be used,  and urged that no change should be made, at any ratewithout prior consultation with the United Kingdom Government (CP. 228 (37),pp. 2-3).  &apos;     4.  It will be recalled that the Irish Free State  External Relations Act of1936 provided in effect that the King  should continue to perform for the IrishFree State those functions in relation  to External Affairs which are performed by His Majesty for  other members of the  British Commonwealth of Nations.  Anattempt  was made  to persuade Mr.  de Valera to incorporate this Act into thenew Constitution of Eire, or, at any rate, to give it equal status as regards the requirement of a special  procedure for amendment or repeal.   Mr. de Valera,however, felt unable to do this.  Nevertheless, the conclusion was reached by theUnited Kingdom Government that, having regard in particular to the existence       [18736]
Dominions Office, March 1, 1939.T. W.  H. I.of this  Act,  it would be proper, notwithstanding that the effect of the newConstitution  was- to eliminate all references to the King from the internal con-stitution of the Irish Free State, to treat the new Constitution as not effectinga fundamental alteration in the position of the Irish Free State as a memberof the British Commonwealth of Nations.  A copy  of  the statement issued onbehalf of  the United Kingdom Government at  the time of  the  coming intooperation of the new Constitution is annexed (Appendix I).    5.  Recently, in the course of  a conversation in Dublin with the Duke of devonshire, Mr. de  Valera raised again the passport question.  He said that theposition of Eire with regard to External Relations was not unsatisfactory to him and  was  seldom obtruded  on  the notice  of  those people  to whom  it wasobjectionable. They did not know, for instance,  that when he appointed a repre-sentative abroad he did so in the name of the King.  But every time one of themwent abroad they could not fail to notice that the &quot; request &quot; page of the passportwas made out in the name of the King, who was, moreover, specifically mentionedas King of Ireland.  Mr. de Valera said that he did not want to do anything to upset us,  but he  would very  much  like,  as  a compromise between  having the  request&quot; page in the name of the King and in his own name, to leave it outaltogether.  He pointed  out that  the  United  States passport  contained  no*&apos; request&apos;&apos; page, and he would very much like  to omit  this page from the Eirepassport.   The Duke of Devonshire said that this seemed to him to be a matterof considerable constitutional importance on which he could not  possibly give an answer, and that he hoped that Mr. de Valera would not send a despatch  on thesubject, but would take some opportunity of discussing the question verbally.    6.  About a week or two later the High Commissioner for Eire called to seems and left with me a letter, of which I attach a  copy as Appendix II, intimatingthe intention of the Government of Eire to alter  the form of passport, not, as hadbeen suggested by Mr. de Valera to the Duke of Devonshire, by the omission ofthe &quot; request &quot; page, but by the substitution of a formula omitting the King&apos;s Name.  Further alterations  to be made in the existing  form of passport would include the omission on the first page of the reference to &apos;; British Commonwealthof Nations &apos;&apos;  and the substitution of &apos;&apos; Ireland &apos;&apos;  (not Eire though presumablyEire and  Irlande would appear also as the Irish and French versions) for IrishFree State.  Mr. Dulanty explained, in handing me the letter, that this was tobe regarded  as a  definite decision, and that it was politically impossible for mr. de Valera to avoid making the change.  I attach as Appendix III a note ofmy talk with Mr. Dulanty.    7.  I am afraid that, in the circumstances,  there is  no real hope of inducingMr. de Valera to change his attitude on this question, and the point on which  Ishould like to have my colleagues&apos; views is whether any written reply should besent to Mr. Dulanty&apos;s letter.  It is  clear, of course (as I told Mr. Dulanty), thatthe retention of forms is not a matter of major importance;  the essential feature of the relation between members of the British Commonwealth of Nations is theirfree association as members of  the Commonwealth, and their co-operation with each other, as members, in matters  of common concern.  A common allegiance tothe Crown is, moreover,  in our view, the very substance of their union, however much this has been strained by recent developments of the Constitution of Eire.But Mr.  de  Valera&apos;s action  is, without doubt, a further  definite  step  in  thedirection of eliminating  the visible signs of the connection between Eire and the King, and I am very doubtful whether it is right to allow this step to be taken without some written comment. I should  propose, therefore,  if my  colleagues agree, to  hand to Mr.  Dulanty a brief written reply to the effect that His Majesty&apos;s Government in  the United Kingdom greatly regret the  proposed elimination of the King&apos;s name from  Eire passports;  that, in their  view, this omission, when it comes to be known, is bound to create a bad impression in the United Kingdom;  and to widen the  separation  which Mr. de Valera deplores between Eire and Northern Ireland.  To say more than this might raise questions which ft was the object of the statement of the 30th December, 1937, to avoid.
APPENDIX I.statement-ent issued on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom,  &apos;&apos;1                 &apos;  published on December 30, 1937.  ,. HIS Majesty&apos;s  Government in the United  Kingdom have considered theposition created by the new Constitution which was approved by the Parliamentof the Irish Free  State in June 1937, and came into force on the 29th December.They are prepared to treat the new Constitution as not effecting a fundamentalalteration in the position of the Irish Free  State, in future to be described underthe new  Constitution as  &quot;Eire&quot; or &quot;Ireland,&quot; as a member of  the  BritishCommonwealth of Nations.    His Majesty&apos;s Government  in  the  United Kingdom  have  ascertained thatHis Majesty&apos;s  Governments in Canada, the  Commonwealth of  Australia, NewZealand  and the Union of South Africa are also prepared so  to treat the newConstitution.    His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom take note of Articles 2,3 and 4 of the new Constitution.  They cannot recognise that the adoption of thename Eire or Ireland, or any other provisions of those Articles, involves any rightto territory or  jurisdiction over territory forming part of the United Kingdomof Great Britain and Northern Ireland, or affects in any way the  position ofNorthern Ireland as an integral part of the  United Kingdom of Great Britainand Northern Ireland.  They therefore regard the use of the name Eire or ireland in this connexion  as relating only to that  area  which has hitherto been knownas the Irish Free  State.APPENDIX II.   Letter from the High Commissioner for Eire to the Secretary of State for                 Dominion Affairs dated February 16, 1939.Dear Secretary of State,    MY Government wish me to inform you, as a matter of courtesy, that theMinister for External Affairs wishes to let you know that he is  considering achange in the existing form of the Irish passport.  The Request Page would read as follows :          &quot; I, the  undersigned, Minister for External Affairs of Ireland, hereby    request all whom it may concern to permit safely and freely to pass, and in    case of  need  to give all lawful aid  and protection to......a citizen of    Ireland.         &quot; Given  under my Hand and Seal at Dublin.&quot;    The first  page of the passport would carry simply the description of thebearer with the heading &quot; Passport,&quot; and underneath &quot; Ireland.&quot;    The model being followed generally is the United States passport.    The association of the States of the Commonwealth is bound as time goes onto depend less and less on the use of forms and symbols and more and more onthe real advantages, social and economic, which the individual States may derive from it.  These forms and symbols have very little binding force  in themselves.They may even have the opposite effect, and in the case of Ireland they do definitelycreate antagonisms and discontent which tend to make isolation from the Common-wealth group a desirable aim of all Nationalists,  Ireland is the only member ofthe association in which the form of the Request Page of the passport is opposedto the will of  the majority of the people, and the people do not understand why they should have  to accept such a humiliating position.   It is not necessary to recall that the King in Ireland is ineradicably associated in the minds of ourgeneration with domination  and ascendancy.   The proclamations and the laws
(down to the year 1921) intended to suppress the aspirations of the Irish people were issued in his name, and the continued use of it in the passport can haveno other result than to perpetuate bitter memories between the two countries. TheIrish  Government, in proposing to eliminate it from the Request  Page of the passport, feel sure they are taking a step which is not only in accordance withthe will of the Irish people, but which will also remove  another obstacle  in theway of friendly  relations with England.                                              Yours sincerely,                                         (Signed)      J. W.* DULANTY.    The Right Hon.        Sir Thomas Inskip, K.C.   .        ;APPENDIX III.Note of Conversation between the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs and         the High Commissioner for Eire on the lQth February, 1939.    MR.  DULANTY called to-day in order to make two communications to me.        ^fc           ^          $fc           $fc           ^    The  second communication which Mr. Dulanty wished to make  to me wasthat an alteration would be made  in the existing form of the Irish passport witha view to eliminating any reference to The King.  I gathered from Mr. Dulantythat a decision to make this change had been arrived at and that the new passportwould be in use at the next holiday season.  The letter which Mr. Dulanty handed to me,  however, merely says that the Minister for External Affairs wishes to let me know that he is considering the change.  Mr. Dulanty repeated the argumentshe had used in connection with the bomb outrages as to the political difficultieswhich  Mr. de Valera would have to meet unless he made  the alteration.   Herecently had been asked in the Dail two questions by two Members as to  theremoval of The King&apos;s  name from the passport,  and it was impossible for himto avoid the change.  Upon reading the letter  handed to me by Mr.  Dulanty Iobserved  a reference in  the last sentence to the removal of &quot; another  obstacle inthe way of friendly relations with England.&quot;   I  told Mr. Dulanty that I hopedMr. de Valera would be under no misapprehension on this point.   As soon asit became known, as was certain sooner or later,  the elimination of The King&apos;s Name  would be seized upon at once in  Northern Ireland  as another  reason  for refusing  any closer relations with Eire.  So far  as the suggestion contained inthe letter went that the proposed change was merely the removal of a form orsymbol, whereas what was important was the advantages which  individual states may derive from their association with each other, I made the observation that what was significant was that the form was being abolished because there wasno desire  to preserve the  substance of the association.  Speaking for myself, I did not regard forms and  symbols as being of primary importance, and the moresubstance there was in  our association,  perhaps  it might be said that the less importance ought to be attached  to forms.  Mr. Dulanty did  not dispute this.His only plea was that Mr. de Valera was forced by his political position to take this action.  I  told Mr.  Dulanty  that, while  I personally  did  not feel  anyresentment,  I felt the greatest possible regret, because I thought  this was achange that presaged the abolition of any mention of The King even in connectionwith external affairs.  I hoped I was wrong, but apparently if Mr. de Valerawas pressed upon  that  point he would feel the pressure  of political influencesto be too  strong for him.....                                                             T. W. H.  I.    February 16, 1939.
