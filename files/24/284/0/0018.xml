(THIS DOCUMENT  IS  THE  PROPERTY OP  HIS  BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT).SECRET.Joint Memorandum by the Lord Chancellor and the Secretary              of State for Dominion Affairs.in dispute between the Secretaries of State for War andfor Air on the one hand, and the First Lord of theAdmiralty on the other hand, with reference to the status of the Judge Advocate General and the Judge Advocate ofthe Fleet.   The difference of opinion arose out of adraft Cabinet Paper prepared by the Secretaries of Statefor War and for Air making certain recommendations inconsequence of a report of a Committee (presided over byMr. Roland Oliver, K.C.) appointed by the secretaries of State to examine the existing system of trial by court martial under the Army and Air Force Acts.2.     We had no formal terms of reference and we havebeen in doubt as to the precise scope of the matters which we should take into consideration.3.     The Courts Martial Committee were of opinion thatthe position of the Judge Advocate General should be oneof absolute independence.   They therefore recommendedthat he should be appointed on the reconiuenaation of, and0..P. 71(39).copy cabinet.POSITION OF THE JUDGE ADVOCATE GENERAL AND THE JUDGE ADVOCATE OF THE FLEET.We were asked to adjudicate upon certain matters
                                                   1J ebe responsible to, some Minister other than the secretaries of State for War and Air.   They also recommended that the functions of the Judge advocate general&apos;s office in connection with the conduct of prosecutions should be transferred to an independentdirectorate with a separate head and a separate staff and office.    The Committee further recommended that thewhole status of the Judge Advocate General and his staff should be raised;  that in the case of petitions raisingquestions of law ana referred to the Juage advocate general for his opinion, his reasons for his advice to the responsible authority should, be given to thepetitioner in writing;  that the Judge Advocate general should.be empowered to hear arguments with reference toany question under consideration by him;  that the judge Advocate General should have the right to obtainthe opinion of the Court of Criminal Appeal upon apoint of law of novelty or exceptional difficulty;  andthat the Judge Advocate at a court martial should notretire with the Tribunal except for consideration of sentence.4.     The Secretaries of State on receiving this reportproposed to give effect to its recommendations byalterations of the law to the following effect:-        (l) that the Judge Advocate General should be           appointed by Letters Patent on the           recommendation of the Lord Chancellor, with           the approbation of the Secretaries  of State           and that he should only be removable from           office  in  the same way as a Judge of the           High Court, that is, by a decision  of both           Houses  of  Parliament:
       (2) that the emoluments of the Judge Advocate           General should be paid out of the Consolidated           Fund of the United Kingdom:       (3) that the new Letters Patent should provide           that the Judge Advocate General should not           be called upon to observe the orders of the           Secretaries of state or to advise before           trial as to the prosecution of any offence           before a court martial:       (4) that the Judge Advocate General should retire           at an age to be determined:       (5) that the Judge Advocate General should, if he           so desired or if so required by the Secretaries           of State obtain the opinion of the Court of           Criminal Appeal upon a point of law:       (6) that the Judge Advocate General should hear           argument on any matter under his consideration           if he so desired.5.     Upon being furnished with a copy of the draft memorandum prepared by the Secretaries of State,  theFirst Lord took strong objections to the proposals onthe ground that, although they did not expressly concern the position of the Judge Advocate of the Fleet,  itwould be difficult,  if not impossible, for him to beon an entirely different basis from that of the judge advocate General ana that the Admiralty were thereforedirectly and immediately concerned in the proposals.The First Lord&apos;s main objection as we understand it wasto the proposal to give the Judge Advocate General thestatus suggested in the Courts Martial Report.   TheFirst Lord also took exception to the proposal that the
Judge Advocate General should hear evidence himself or should he at liberty to obtain the opinion of the Courtof Criminal Appeal, the ground of this objection being that the proposals come dangerously near opening anappeal from the court martial.6.     We have had the advantage of discussing thematters in question with representatives of the threeSer-vices.   In the course of these discussions it became apparent that the circumstances with wnich Naval courts martial have to deal differ, and in some respectswidely, from those which relate to offences under theArmy and Air Force Acts.    Stating the matter very shortly, four things should be borne in mind as regardsthe Navy:       First, offences against the ordinary criminal       law of the United Kingdom committed on shore       (not including arsenals, dockyards ana other       premises use a for naval or military purposes)       are not dealt with by Naval Tribunals.       Secondly, offences committed by men living       under the conditions of ship life are often  so       serious as regards their reactions on the ship&apos;s       company as a whole that they have to be regarded       and dealt with from a special standpoint which a       landsman may not very easily understand.       Thirdly, offences of tue nature of breaches  of       discipline and charges in relation to negligence       or default in carrying out professional duties       are matters which can only be dealt with       efficiently by naval tribunals.
       Fourthly, the Naval Courts Martial have often       to he convened in far distant places and in out       of the way ports, thousands of miles away from       this country, and it is necessary in the interests       of discipline, both in times of peace and of war,       that the sentences awarded by Courts Martial       should be given immediate operation.7o     For these and other reasons we have come.to theconclusion that, as in the past, there should be noappeal in the proper sense from any of the findings of a naval Court Martial, and that it would be a seriousmistake so to alter the present system as to suggest tothe public that some kina of Court of Appeal is nowbeing contemplated.   The functions of the Judge Advocateof the Fleet should in substance remain as they are,that is, of a -purely legal character.   Ke is and shouldbe concerned with nothing more than the legality of the trial and sentence.   In performing these duties he holdsa position analogous to that of Counsel retained toadvise the Board of Admiralty.   We think therefore thatit is undesirable that he should be given or appear to possess the status of a High Court Judge;  since his responsibilities and functions are quite different andare performed in a wholly different manner from thoseof a High Court Judge.   On the other hand, we are ofopinion that the terms of his appointment should be suchas to render impossible any suggestion that he is thenominee of the Minister whom it is.his duty to advise.We therefore recommend that, his qualifications beingessentially legal, he should be appointed by the LordChancellor under Letters Patent after consultation with,
or with .the approval of the First Lord.   We think thathe should be appointed for a term of years and should beremovable on the joint recommendation of the LordChancellor and the First Lord.    We also think that the judge Advocate of the Fleet should be relieved of any responsibility for advising the Admiralty in matters relating to the provision for or conduct of trials bycourts martial,   We are informed that the occasions onwhich such advice is sought are very rare.   The change which we recommend is therefore rather one of form than of substance..    We have however come to the conclusion -which may be of some importance in dealing withuninformed criticism - that the position of the judge advocate of the Fleet as an adviser on points of law should be marked by a requirement that in the event ofhis advising the Board of Admiralty that irregularitiesin a court martial have produced a miscarriage ofjustice in the conviction of the accused, the Board ofAdmiralty should be obliged to accept the advice andquash the conviction without prejudice to their right to direct a new Court Martial to be held if they think fit.Here again we understand that cases in which the Boardof Admiralty do not act on the advice of the judge advocate of the Fleet when it is to the effect we have mentioned are practically unknown or at any rate havebeen very rare indeed in recent times.   In other caseswe think the Board of Admiralty should be free as now totake such action on the advice they have received asthey may think the case requires.
8.     We are opposed to any suggestion that the judge advocate of the Fleet should have the right to heararguments by the parties or their Counsel after a court martial has been held though it should he permissible forstatements in writing of their contentions to be placed before him for his consideration.   For somewhat  similar reasons we think it would be unwise to empower him toobtain the opinion of the Court of Criminal Appeal uponquestions of law.   It may be observed that questions oflaw and fact are often very closely connected and in ourview it would sometimes be very difficult for the Courtof Criminal Appeal to disentangle the two in a caseinvolving naval matters and. to give a useful decision.9,     Having formed these opinions with regard to thestatus and functions of the Judge Advocate of the Fleetwe proceeded to consider the proposals of the secretaries of State-   If in so doing we have exceeded our termsof reference this part of our report will be disregardedexcept in so far as it may be taken as an expression ofour opinion as members of the Cabinet,.10.    We have come to the same conclusions withreference to the appointment and the dismissal of the judge Advocate General as in the case of the Judge Advocateof the Fleet and we need not repeat those conclusions.Apart from this matter it may well be that the regulations or amendments of the law in relation to Courts Martial inthe Army and Air Force should be different from thosein the Havy for the reasons above indicated.
11.    We agree with the recommendation of the secretaries of State that provision should be ruade in the letters patent of appointment to the effect that the judge advocate General should not be called upon to observe the orders of- the Secretaries of State or to advisebefore the trial as to the prosecution of any offencebefore a court martial.   We are of opinion that either in the Letters Patent or other instrument of appointmentof the Judge Advocate of the Fleet similar provisions should appear.12.    We have not thought it necessary in this memorandum to consider the formal amendments in  the  law if anywhich may require to be made to give effect to our recommendations.    We understand that as the result ofour discussion of the matters in question with therepresentatives of the three Departments,  there will beno difficulty in devising suitable methods of giving effect to our advice if it is accepted ana, althoughthe representatives of the Departments had no authorityto bind the First Lord or the Secretaries of State, webelieve our recommendations will be agreeable to the viewsof the Departments.   The broad intention underlyingour recouiuendations is that the Judge Advocates shouldbe made to appear what in practice they have been formany years, namely, independent advisers of the Depart-ments to which they are appointed, and that they shouldbe relieved of any duties in connection with the conductof the prosecution of accused persons.   So far as the minor details of the recouimendations of the Courts
Martial Committee or of the Secretaries of State in their draft memorandum are concerned, these are matters capableof adjustment and we have thought it unnecessary toconsider them in this memorandum.   We have not expressedany opinion with reference to the proposal that the emoluments of the Judge Advocate General should be paid out of the Consolidated Fund of the United Kingdom.This is a matter primarily for the consideration of theChancellor of the Exchequer, though if our opinion is desired it is to the effect that we should, see no advantage in the proposal.
