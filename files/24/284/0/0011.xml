(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC               MAJESTY 1 S GOVERNMENT ) .COPY NcSECRET.CP. No. 64/39CABINETINDI.      Appreciation of the Political,Situation, bythe Government of India, dated 17th February, 1939     Circulated for the information of the Cabinetby the Secretary of State for India.
Confidential appreciation of the Political situationin India, dated the 17th February,  1939,  issued on the   authority of the Secretary of State for India.      Congress  -  The  Congress world has.been thrown into confusion by the re-election of Subhas Chandra Bose as President.   It  has  been  the accepted practice in recent years for Gandhi&apos;s  choice to become President without a contest.   On  this  occasion three candidates were nominated by  &quot;the electors.    Abul Kalam Azad, a Bengali Muslim, was regarded as .the  &quot;official&quot; candidate.   He after some vacillation withdrew,  a few days before the poll, in favour of Pattabhi  Sitar&quot;amayya, a Madras Telugu.   Subhas Bose, who might  not  have  stood against the Bengali Muslim, refused to leave  the field to Sitaramayya, in spite of a personal appeal  from Gandhi and statements issued by Jawaharlal Nehru  and seven other members of the Working Committee, which were strongly opposed to Bose1 s re-election though vague as  to the reasons for his ineligibility. Bose stood his ground, and was elected by a majority of about 200 in a poll  of about 3000.   The result has caused general astonishment,  jubilation but also bewilderment in  the Left wing, and  scarcely disguised anger among the High Command.   Bose&apos;s majority in. his own Province (Bengal) was alone enough  to win him the election, but his majority was large in the United Provinces,  the Punjab and some other areas.   Sitaramayya polled nearly all the votes in his own area (Andhra) but was in a minority in the other three linguistic  areas which comprise the Madras Presidency.    Though the result represents some swing to the Left,  this is not as strong as the figures would suggests   and it  seems to be now certain that the Eight wingwill be in a majority in the All-India Congress Committee
                                     i                  2. .; session  to  be  held next  month.    Bose  was  personally  much the stronger  candidates   and the  main  contributary  causes of his  success appear  to be  disgust  with the  dictatorial methods  practised by the Working  Committee and its  Parliament- ary Sub-Committee,  and Bose&apos;s effective  propaganda  imputing to his  colleagues in the High Command  a  design to accept  the Federal  scheme.    The  protagonists  on  both sides  haye been so much taken  by  surprise that  it  is impossible  yet  to  calculate their probable courses of conduct.   Gandhi has placed Bose in a dilemma,  by  professing to  accept Bose&apos;s  victory as  a defeat for himself, and  by indicating  that  his  own followers in  the Working  Committee,  the Provincial Ministries,  and the Congress party would be willing to- come  out and leave  the field to the successful  leader  and  his faction.   Bose  can do  little with- out Gandhi&apos;s support and is  conscious  of the  weakness of  the- position in -which he finds himself;  while the  Left wing  now looks to him to implement his threat to force  the British Government  to  throw over  the  new  constitution and parley  with Congress for something more nearly approaching  independence. Both sections  of  Congress, being  thus  at a standstill, will probably welcome  a  battle-cry which will unite  them in a common cause.  This  may  be found  in the quarrel over  the States which combines  the  advantages of Gandhi&apos;s leadership and  an urgent  challenge to constitutional  authority. 2.    Indian States  - There have been rapid and  important developments since the last Appreciation was written.   The settlement  in Hajkot State has broken  down:   civil disobediencehas  been resumed:    and Gandhi&apos;s wife and Vallabhai Patel&apos;sdaughter, who entered the State and courted arrest,  areundergoing a polite form  of confinement.   In Jaipur JamnalalBajaj, a member of the  Congress (forking Committee, has defieda ban on his entry  into the State, and on his  third invasion
                                                        11) w has been similarly interned.    Trouble  continues  in  small States  bordering  on the  Central Provinces  and  Orissa,  and is being- fomented from those  Provinces.    Gandhi&apos;s utterances have imputed  unscrupulous  repression  to the  Rulers,  and acquiescence  or abetment therein to the British officers connected with the States.    He and Jawaharlal Nehru and Vallabhai Patel,  with  increasing violence  since Subhas Bose&apos;s election,  threaten tile overthrow of the States&apos; administra- tions,  and show a determination to involve in  the  struggle the  Congress  Ministries, particularly those  of Provinces contiguous to  the States affected.    The usefulness  of the agitation as  a cloak&apos; to  discord in the  Congress party  can be  deduced from Nehru&apos;s  statement that  &quot;everything else is secondary to  this  major  struggle, for in its sweep it will comprise  Federation, provincial  autonomy, and  other  impediments to our  freedom.&quot;    Thus  the original  motive  for a  conflict, namely  a  desire to  cause such embarrassment  to the Rulers  as would induce  them to accept election  as the  means  of appoint- ing  States&apos; representatives to  the future Federal Assembly and  so  make Federation safe for  Congress, is now reinforced by the  need for diverting attention from the dissensions within the party.  - 3.   Meanwhile  communal  trouble  is serious in many parts of India.   The attempt to celebrate  &quot;Hyderabad Day&quot; on January 22nd  in protest against  alleged ill-treatment ofHindus in that State caused riots in several places inBritish India?  in Delhi 70 persons were injured,  and atBareilly 4 persons were killed and many injured.   Thoughthe festival of Bakrid on February 1st passed off without as much disturbance as was  feared, this was secured only byelaborate precautions in many cities.    In a village in Bihartwo persons were killed in a riot over the  vexed question ofcow-sacr if ice, and some persons wounaed -when the  policeopened fire on an  immense mob.   In Dera Ismail Khan (Frontier
Province) the casualties in a fight between Hindus and Muslimover the same controversy were 11 deaths and many personsinjured:  much property was destroyed by arson.   The worstdisturbance however has been in Casnpore, where a quarrelover the playing  of music outside a mosque by a Hindumarriage party led to  sporadic disorder in the course ofwhich between February 11th and 13th over 40 persons are said to have been billed and a great number injured;  thecity was in a panic;  the police had to fire on several occasions, and British troops were posted at strategic points in the city.   In Aligarh (United Provinces) students of the muslim University followed up an altercation with the policeby an attack in overwhelming force on a police camp; about40 policemen were injured and the camp set on fire.4.   Some Provincia1 Ministries have now presented theirbudgets for the coming financial year;   these, and probably the budgets under preparation in other Provinces, containproposals for&apos; fresh taxation which will scarcely be welcomed.Bengal hope to get Rs. 12&apos; lakhs by new taxes on betting andon professions, and propose to raise a loan o  one crore ofrupees.    The Bombay Ministry have to find new revenue ofHs.220 lakhs, mainly to cover the loss to be incurred by anextension of prohibition:   among the areas where prohibitionwill be enforced is Bombay city and its suburbs:   the chiefitem of new.taxation is a 10)b impost on the rateable valueof urban property, which will bring home to the people of bombay the fact that prohibition is a luxury which has tobe paid for.   The Bombay Finance Minister announced that inorder to finance the full prohibition programme,  to becompleted next year,  the Government intend to ask.theCentral  Government to anticipate the payment to the province of a larger share of income tax,  and to ask the authorities concerned to agree to- a reduction in salaries of all the
                                                        1 o                                                      1Services, including those under the control of the Secretaryof State.5.   The Ministries in two (Bengal and Sind) of the non-Congress Provinces are still changing?   in the former  one  ofthe two Muslim Ministers added in November last has resigned;in Sind two-new Ministers have just been appointed, bringing the total up to five.6.   Other events in the Provinces may be briefly mentioned.In Bengal, as a result of the examination (still proceeding)of individual cases of terrorist convicts by the advisorycommittee appointed by the Government, 40 persons have been released.   The committee appointed by the Bombay Governmentto enquire into the causes&apos; and handling of the labour  riots ofNovember 7th has recently reported;   it places theresponsibility for the riots on the &quot;Council of Action1&apos;which incited violent methods,  and finds that the policeacted entirely in self-defence in resorting to firing.   InMadras the anti-Hindi agitation shows no signs of abatementsnearly 700 persons have no?/ been convicted.   Both chambers of the Legislature debated the report of an Estates LandAct Committee relating to tenancy conditions in thepermanently settled areas of the Province;  though some ofthe committee&apos;s recommendations are regarded as makingunparalleled inroads into the rights of zarnindars, theMinistry gave the report its blessing and a motion wasadopted in both Houses that legislation should be framedon the basis of it.   In the United Provinces the TenancyBill is still under discussion in the Assembly.   Labour hasbeen restive in some of the cities,  and in Lucknow the threat of a strike in the public utility services at theend of January was averted only at the last moment.7.   Both Chambers of the Central Legislature have beensitting.   The Income-Tax Bill has passed through theLegislature.   The Congress and Muslim League in the Assembly

The  Railway Budget has been presented:  it estimates  for the current year a surplus of Rs.2.05 crores and for  the&apos; coming year a surplus of Rs.2.13 crores.  On non-official initiative the Government have been censured in  the Assembly for failing to secure the safety of life and property of Indians in Burma.   A recommendation was carried that India should withdraw from the League of Nations:   Muslim  League support ,-.as given to this on the ground of  dissatisfaction with British policy in Palestine. Such a resolution is  of course not binding on the Government of  India.   The Assembly also recommended a cut in the  salary of  all servants of the Government of India earning Rs.200 a month or more:  the Government party abstained from the discussion and  vote on the motion, in order to avoid any indication  of what might be contained in the budget proposals.                   WA2IRISTAN. 8.   There- has  been little change in the Waziristan situation.    The  faqir of Ipi has continued to move about in the vicinity of the Durand Line in North Waziristan and further air action has been taken against villages harbouring him.   A column of troops has been operating in the Khaisoravalley in order to increase the pressure on the hostile ToriKhel Wazir  sections who are under blockade.    There has been some slight sniping but no real opposition has been encounter- ed.    The hostile sections however as yet show no signs of submitting.  South rtaziristan has been quiet.
