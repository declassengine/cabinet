COPY NO._&quot;UCoP. 60(59).                             CABINET.                    COTTON INDUSTRY (RE-ORGANISATION) BILL.                Memorandum &quot;by the President of the Board of Trade.                  In December last I was authorised by my colleagues (see             Cabinet 60(38) f. conclusion 14) to publish a White Paper             containing the clauses of a draft Bill, based substantially             upon the proposals of the Joint Committee of Cotton Trade             Organisations, for the re-organisation of the cotton             industry, together with a short explanatory memorandum.  The             paper (Cmd.. 5935) was issued on 6th February, and copies were             sent to all producing firms in the industry,&quot; together with a             &quot;ballot paper on which they were asked to record their votes             either for or against the introduction in Parliament of a             Bill embodying the provisions of the draft.    In addition,             the three Chambers of Commerce chiefly interested, namely,             Manchester, London and Glasgow, were ashed to ascertain the             views of their members so far as these were affected, and             the three Trade Unions concerned were invited to express the             views of their organisations.                  The result of the ballot of producers is as follows:-                  The number of effective ballot papers received was             1,997.    The  firms who voted represented  over three-quarters             of  the estimated number of firms in the industry as defined             &quot;by  the Bill;   on the  basis of employment  the proportion             exceeded five-sixths.                  The proportion of votes in favour of the Bill in each             section  of the  industry was  as  follows                                    -I-

As was to be expected;, the views of merchants aredistinctly less favourable.   The Manchester Chamber took apostal ballot of their members on the basis of the White Paper.While the ballot was open to all members of the Chambers, the votes cast were classified as between members interested inthe proposals and those whose interests lay outside.    Theresult showed a majority of some 5 to 1 against the Bill amongmerchants dealing in the home market, and of some 4-g- to 1against the Bill among the export merchants.   On the otherhand, of the members engaged in the -producing sections of theindustry, 436 voted for the Bill and 167 against it.     The Cotton Exporters&apos; Section of the London Chamber ofCommerce passed a resolution against the Bill on the groundthat it provides insufficient representation for exportmerchants and inadequate  safeguards  to maintain a just balance between the interests of merchants and producers.     The Glasgow Chamber recorded a  vote of 8 to 5  in favourof  the Bill.     The three Trade Unions expressed themselves in favourof  the Bill.
63     I do riot think there is anything very surprising inthese results, though the support forthcoming from theproducing sections of the industry is more substantial than atone time appeared likely.   It is, I think, clearly sufficientto warrant the introduction of a Bill, in spite of the opposition of the raer chanting interests.    I therefore ask for authorityto announce that the Government have decided to introduce theBill forthwith.   At the same time, I should propose to invitethe merchanting ixiterests to consider what further safeguardsthey regard as essential to protect them and to formulateproposals accordingly that can &quot;be considered at the proper time during the progress of the Bill.   As&quot; regards the Bill, Ishould propose, with my colleagues; permission, to circulate it tothe Home Affairs Committee for consideration at their next meeting and to introduce it immediately it has received their approval.,                                  O.F.G.S.Board of Trade,     3rd March, 1939.
