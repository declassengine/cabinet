COPY No.  2CP. 66 (39)THE  CABINETPROPOSAL TO PUBLISH  THE  REPORT  OF THE          COURTS-MARTIAL COMMITTEE   MEMORANDUM BY THE  SECRETARY  OF  STATE FOR WAR AND                 THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR    In the course of the debate on the Army and Air Force (Annual) Bill in 1937the then Secretary of State for  War  promised  to look into the question whether there ought not to be a right of appeal against  Court-Martial convictions for civiloffences.  Thereafter there were repeated requests to institute this enquiry, and inMarch, 1938, the formation of a strong Committee on Court-Martial procedure was announced under the Chairmanship of Mr. Roland Oliver, K.C. (now Mr.  JusticeOliver).  Mr. J.  J. Lawson,  M.P., was one of  the  members of the Committee.Last July the Committee made its Report, of  which a  copy is attached as anAnnexure.  The publication of the Report (which was prepared with a view  toits publication) has been awaiting decisions as to  the action to be taken on therecommendations.   Some of the recommendations relate to administrative mattersof a non-contentious  kind,  and  these  are   being dealt   with  as a  Servicematter between  our two Departments.  The main recommendations relate to theappointment, constitution and functions of the Judge Advocate General, and  inconnexion with these we understand  that the  First Lord of the Admiralty hasserious  misgivings.  The differences between us  have now  been referred byagreement to the Lord  Chancellor and Sir Thomas Inskip and  we await theirviews in due course.    2.  Meanwhile, we  are being subjected to  increasing pressure to publish theReport of the Oliver Committee and the time has come when we feel that we must do  so  without  waiting for decisions on  its  recommendations.   Last  October,Sir William Allen, M.P., was  given to  understand that the Report would  bepublished shortly, and  he raised  the  question  again  in the debate on army estimates on 8th March.   It is very desirable   that  the Report should be in thehands  of   Members by the date  of the Committee Stage  of  the Army andAir Force  (Annual) Bill at the end of this month.    3.  We accordingly seek the agreement of our colleagues  to  the immediatepublication of the Report as a Command Paper.                                                              L.

ANNEXURE      Report  of the  Army and  Air force courts-Martial Committee           I938[Com. war. 84](2663)A 2-
REPORT   The Committee was constituted by the Secretaries of State forWar and Air under War  Office letter dated 18th March, 1938,&quot;To examine the existing system of trial by Court-Martial underthe Army and Air Force Acts and matters incidental thereto,and  in particular to consider whether it is desirable and prac-ticable that a person convicted by Court-Martial should haveHie right of appeal to a civil judicial tribunal against his con-viction and to make recommendations &apos;&apos;.   The members of the Committee, were:- -     Mr. ROLAND OLIVER, M.C., K.C. (Chairman).     Mr. TRISTRAM BERESFORD, K.C.     The Rt. Hon. Sir FELIX CASSEL, Bt., K.C.     Mr. J. J. LAWSON,-M.P.     Air  Vice-Marshal  Sir  C.  A.  H.  LONGCROFT,  K.C.B.,       C.M.G., D.S.O., A.F.C., and  &apos;   General Sir FELIX READY, G.B.E., K.C.B., C.S.I., C.M.G.,       D.S.O.                           Secretary.     Major W. R. F. OSMOND (War Office).                     Assistant Secretary.     Mr. H. H. HOBBS (War Office).   The Committee sat on 29th March, 1938, and on 19  laterdates.   1. For the reason that the great majority of the witnesseswould in the nature of things be in His Majesty&apos;s service it wassuggested that the meetings of the Committee should be held in private.  The Committee after consideration decided that thiscourse would tend to ensure that the evidence, particularly fromwitnesses of junior ranks, would be placed  before us withoutTeserve  and it was therefore adopted.   2. In  addition  to  evidence  from  the  Judge  Advocate-GeneraPs Department and from Officers with special knowledgeof disciplinary matters the Committee invited evidence from acertain number of Barristers, Solicitors and others having speciallegal knowledge  in connection with  Courts-Martial.
   3- Persons desirous of placing their views before the Com-mittee were invited to submit written memoranda setting out thesubstance of their criticisms  and suggestions.  After considering these memoranda we invited  a selection of those who had written them to attend personally before us, and further developsuch matters  as  they wished,  and answer  questions put  ByMembers of the Committee.  In all, 382 memoranda were sub-mitted and 51  witnesses.were examined. All persons submittingmemoranda and/or  giving evidence orally were informed that.their identity and views would  not be published, but that theirmemoranda and  a transcript  of their  oral  evidence  (if any)would be  annexed to and form part of our proceedings.  such persons included officers and men of all ranks of both services.   4. Broadly speaking the function of the Committee was to-investigate whether upon the whole the existing system of Court-Martial  worked  out  satisfactorily and  did substantial justice,and further to consider if there were any ways in which it.mightbe improved, and particularly  whether any, and if so whatsystem of appeal  (as understood in Civil Courts) was desirable or practicable.   5. On  the  15th March, 1938, the names of the Members ofthe Committee and the terms  of reference were announced inParliament and this  announcement  was very  widely advertisedin the Press.   6. The very meagre response to this publicity made it earlyapparent  that there  was no wide public  interest in the Com-mittee&apos;s deliberations, from which it seemed to follow there wasno.widespread discontent with the existing system.  The Com-mittee thereupon decided that if they were  to obtain information on a broader  scale they would have to seek  it for themselves,and  on   7th  April  the  Committee  decided to  request  theauthorities to circulate a letter throughout  the Army and RoyalAir Force serving at home respectively inviting suggestions andcomplaints with regard to  the  Court-Martial system from  all ranks of officers and men.  The forms of letter actualfy circu-lated throughout  the  Army  and Royal Air Force  are annexed to this Report (Appendix II).  It was only after the circulariza-tion  of these letters to all Commands of both Services  at homethat memoranda began to come in on a large scale.   7. In  the circumstances  it  would not  be  expected that ^weshould receive many  memoranda from persons who had nothing but praise for the existing system,  or  did not want it altered.We nevertheless did receive  quite a number.  Moreover, a very
5large proportion, of persons who submitted memoranda and / orgave evidence prefaced such  criticisms as  they had  with  theopinion that no fairer tribunal than a Court-Martial was knownto them.    8. Inasmuch as the object of the Committee was to discoverif possible where the system had failed,  in every case wherecomplaint was  made of injustice resulting from  any trial by court-Martial, no matter  how long ago,  we  invited the com-plainant to attend personally before us with  a  view to  testingthe  nature  and  substance of his complaint, at the  same timeinforming him that we could not act as a Court of Appeal.  Thetotal of such cases was 17, ranging in date  from the year 1917to  the present time, an average of less than one a year.   In- every such case the  transcripts and records of the proceedings were before the  Committee.  The Chairman personally studiedthe  whole of these Proceedings and was  satisfied, as  were  theCommittee,  that not one of them disclosed any miscarriage ofjustice.*  In making this statement it  must be understood thatthe  Committee is not expressing any opinion as to the truthful-ness of the evidence in any case.  That was, of course, a matter for  the Tribunal in each case.  We concerned ourselves only tosee  that there was in every case proper evidence  on which the Court-Martial, properly directed, could and  did act.  Our inves-tigations  satisfied us that when  in matters  of substance  thetribunal had erred in law the operation of the Judge Advocate-Generahs Department had set the matter right, and  where ina few cases there had been errors in matters of procedure, these were of a character falling within Rule of Procedure 56, whichprdvides  that,  where guilt  has  been established  by  proper evidence the findings and sentence of Courts-Martial shall be confirmed,  notwithstanding any defect or  objection,  techincal or  other, unless it appears that any injustice  has been done tothe offender.  (It should further be borne in mind that if  any irregularity  goes to  the jurisdiction of a  Court-Martial,  such a-defect at the instance of the aggrieved party  can  be dealt with under the existing law in a Civil Court.)    9. The Committee consider that the facts stated in the  last paragraph constitute the best answer to the critics  of the present Court-Martial system, and furnish a very  great tribute not onlyto  the system as a whole but to the ability and care  exercised in  the Office of the  Judge Advocate-General.  We cannot suffi- ciently emphasize the importance of the result that our studiedsearch for cases of injustice covering a period of 20 years,  and from all over the world, has discovered not a single one.  *  This statement does not apply  to one case  known to the Chairman relating to a sentence which was sub judice at the time and was not beforethe  Committee.
6   ior The general good&apos;health of the system is, in our opinion,.further evidenced by the fact that convictions by Court-Martialduring the last 30  years (omitting for obvious reasons  the war years) show a steady decline.  In 1909 in the Army there were10,761; by  1913 they had fallen to  7,052;  in 1923 there were6,185, and thereafter the figures have steadily declined until in1937  there were only 2,158 (see the General Annual Reports onthe  British Army for the appropriate years).   11. For the better understanding of this Report we think itis desirable that it should next be made clear what is the generalscheme of procedure leading up to, at, and after a Court-Martial.      (i)  The Accused is put under  arrest and taken before his          Commanding Officer who hears oral evidence, and          if he considers the matter should go further directs-      (ii)  A Summary of Evidence to be taken in the Accused&apos;s          presence in writing.     (iii)  Upon his consideration of  this Summary the   Com-          manding  Officer  decides  once  more  whether  the          matter should proceed, and if he so decides     (iv)  A Charge Sheet is prepared and the papers are for-          warded to the Convening Officer whose duty it is, if           he thinks right, to convene a  Court-Martial.      (v)  If  the Convening Officer  considers it  a proper case           for Court-Martial he  orders a Court to be convened           consisting  of  Officers  whose  number  and  rank           depends  upon   the  nature   of the  Court-Martial           ordered whether General  or District and the rank of           the Accused.  In all cases it is open to the Convening           Officer  to  consult  a  Department  in the  Judge           Advocate-General&apos;s  Office (of which more later) in           connection with the framing of the Charges and the           preparation of the case for the prosecution.     (vi) At all General Courts-Martial  and in serious cases at           District Courts-Martial a Judge Advocate attends for           the purpose of advising the Court on  matters of law,           asking  questions to clear  up  doubtful  points  in the           evidence, and summing-up.    (vii) If the Court-Martial convicts and sentence is passed on           the Accused neither conviction nor sentence is opera-           tive unless and until confirmed by  the confirming           authority, who is usually, but not always, the Con-           vening Officer.    Thereafter the  matter passes to           various other reviewing  authorities culminating with           the Army or Air Councils or  H.M. the King advised           by the Judge Advocate-General.
     (viii) Every single conviction by Court-Martial, no matter          where it  occurs, is automatically reviewed in the          Office of the Judge Advocate-General where the pro-          ceedings are critically examined  by a professional          staff of legal experts for the purpose of ascertaining          whether there is any defect in  point of law invalidat-          ing  the proceedings  or any part  thereof.   The          discovery of any such defect results in  the  prompt          quashing  of any conviction .which cannot legally be          supported.  It is unnecessary  for the purpose of this          Report to detail the numerous successive authorities          which have power to  consider and in proper  cases          mitigate,  commute or remit  the  sentence.  There-          after the Accused has the right to petition any of the          reviewing authorities and the  Army or Air Councils          as the case may be and finally His Majesty the King.          Any  such petition which raises  a question of law          must in the  United Kingdom be referred to the Judge          Advocate-General for  advice.  At present there  is          no limit to the  number of such petitions.   12. The  scheme  of procedure above outlined has satisfiedus, as it did the Darling  Committee in  1919, that in  the caseof persons convicted by Court-Martial there exists  a series  ofsafeguards against injustice at least equal to  those which applyto the case of civilians  convicted of crime in the Civil Courts.   13. The constitution and functions of the Judge Advocate-Generals Office must next  be  considered.  It is a widespreadbelief, and we had  it repeated before us again and  again inmemoranda and in evidence, that the persons who prepare casesfor Prosecution and act as Prosecutors before Courts-Martial are often the agents of the Judge Advocate-General, who takes theplace of  a Court of Appeal in  that he advises the Secretary ofState and the Army Council upon matters of law. The argumentproceeds: what is the use  of  a  Court of Appeal  which itselfprepared and / or conducted the Prosecution ?  In fact,  this idea is totally fallacious, though it has undoubtedly been fostered bymisleading expressions in the King&apos;s Regulations,  and the factthat   in  cases  where legally qualified  persons  take  part  inprosecution prior to  and at  Courts-Martial,  they usually belong to a  Department which is part of the Judge Advocate-Generalsestablishment.   14. The present constitution of the Judge Advocate-GeneralsOffice provides for two entirely separate Departments.   (2663)                                                B
     (i) The Military and Air Force Department, consisting of          serving  Officers  with  legal  qualifications,  whose          duties consist, so  far  as Courts-Martial  are  con-          cerned, with the preparation of cases before trial,          and the supplying where necessary&apos; of  Officers to          conduct Prosecutions.    (ii) The Judge Advocate-General&apos;s  Office  proper, the staff          of which consists of Civil Servants who are drawn          from the ranks of practising members of the Bar  and          whose functions  in relation to Courts-Martial  are          confined to reviewing  proceedings after  trial  and          supplying Judge Advocates  to act at  the  trial.   It          is  an absolute rule that no  one who  has acted as          Judge Advocate in  any case takes part in its review.          The  present   establishment   provides   the  Judge          Advocate-General,  one  Deputy Judge   Advocate-          General, two Deputy Judge  Advocates and a Legal          Assistant and Registrar.  In practice any case under          review which presents any real difficulty  is reviewed          ultimately by the Judge Advocate-General himself.   15. It is obvious from the  above that the responsibilities ofthe Judge Advocate-General are very heavy, and in  our opinionit is of the utmost importance, not only  that his position should in fact be one of absolute independence, as in practice we aresatisfied it always has been, but also that the public should notbe under the apprehension that the Judge Advocate-General isin any real sense a subordinate official of the War Office or AirMinistry.  The great importance of  avoiding public misunder-standing in this matter has also  led us to recommend the com-plete separation of the Military and Air Force Department fromeven the nominal control of the Judge Advocate-General.  these considerations have led your Committee to make the following recommendations:       (i) That the Judge Advocate-General should be appointed          on the recommendation of,  and be responsible to,          some Minister other than the Secretary  of State for          War or Air.    (ii) (a) That the functions  exercised by  the Military  and          Air  Force  Department  of  the  Judge  Advocate-          Generahs Office  in connection with the  conduct of          prosecutions or any advice relating thereto, or  any          matter  preliminary to  trial, should  be  transferred          to an independent  Directorate with a separate head          (who might be termed  Director of Military and Air          Force Legal Services) who should have an adequate          staff and a separate office, and would be responsible
          to the Adjutant-General and Air Member for  Per-          sonnel respectively.   It would  be a matter for the          consideration of the  Army Council  and Air Council          whether there should be a combined Directorate or a          separate  Directorate  for War and Air.    (b) That as and  when practicable a  similar separation of          functions should be effected in the office of the Judge          Advocate-General  in India  so far as the British          Establishment in India is concerned.   If the recommendations (ii) (a) and  (b)  are adopted wethink that the fact of this separation cannot be  made too widely known in the Services concerned and elsewhere.   16. Inasmuch  as  the  reviewing  of cases in  the judge advocate-Generahs Office  takes  (if the present  system is tocontinue) the place of all final appeals on questions of law  and procedure,  we  think  that the  whole  status of  the judge advocate-General  and his  staff should be raised.  It is not inthe public nor any sound interest that it should be possible torefer  to him as  a  mere official, a servant  of  the authority headvises, liable (in  theory at least) to  be ignored or even sum-marily dismissed.  In our view he should be in a position more in keeping  with the responsibilities  of his  office.   If there be a weak spot in the whole system in our opinionit is that so  much depends  upon the individual reliability of the judge Advocate-Generahs  staff.   His subordinates  should be selected with the greatest care, and this means, inter alia,  thattheir  remuneration should be sufficient to attract really promis-ing young men who will be capable in the future of taking theirplaces as thoroughly  competent Judge Advocates.   17. If our recommendation  to  separate the duties of the judge Advocate-Generahs Office  be  accepted  and  the newDirectorate of Legal Services  established, it follows that some increase of staff  and some considerable alteration of duties willbe needed  in the office of the Judge Advocate-General.   It is apparent     (1) that it is desirable that Judge Advocates should always           sit with Courts-Martial in serious cases,    (2) that the existing staff of Judge Advocates  is barely           sufficient to cope with the present demands, and    (3) that having regard to the rapid expansion of the  Royal           Air Force the time has  arrived when an increase           should be made.  We therefore recommend that one           more Deputy Judge Advocate should be appointed.   (2663)                                              B 2
IO   In order that there may be  complete liaison between the judge Advocate-GeneraTs-Office and the new Directorate of legal Services, it will,  we think, be desirable that  two senior officers from the Directorate of Legal Services selected by the judge Advocate-General should be seconded to the office of the judge Advocate-General for a period of two or three years, andthat other officers from this service should be  attached for aperiod of six months&apos; instruction before proceeding  to take upappointments abroad.   We attach the greatest importance to the adequate staffing ofall departments which are entrusted with  the  administration ofJustice in the Services affected.   18. With regard  to  India,  it  has  been,  unfortunately,impossible, owing to the distance separating that country fromthis, to obtain any  direct assistance  from  the  India  Office.  Atthe request of the Committee the  War Office wrote to the IndiaOffice on the 21st April, 1938, asking for certain information and  their views upon matters within the  Committee&apos;s terms ofreference.  On the 26th May, 1938, a reply was received statingthat the matter was  receiving the urgent attention of the Govern-ment of  India.  There it has rested.   We  did not think  it worth while delaying this report further.   India has a separate  Judge Advocate-General, who is notat present a Deputy  of the Judge Advocate-General at home,although in fact the whole of his  reviewing work so far as concerns white troops  serving in India is in the end furtherreviewed by the  Judge Advocate-General in England.   TheCommittee thinks that the Judge  Advocate-General  in  India.should in relation to his duties connected with Courts-Martialon persons subject to the Army and Air Force  Acts be a Deputyof the Judge Advocate-General at home, while remaining judge advocate-General in India so far as native troops are concerned.   19. In considering the judicial machinery  best suited to the armed forces of the Crown several  things must be realised atthe  outset.      (i) A citizen when he joins such a  force voluntarily sub-           mits himself  to  a regime which is based  upon           discipline.      (ii)  In the vital interests of discipline many things  may           be forbidden  to  the  soldier or airman which  are           permitted  to the civilian.     (iii)  The exigencies of his service demand that he has to be           prepared to  serve all over the  world.     (iv)  The machinery for dealing with offences which affect           discipline  must be prompt and, if necessary, severe           in its operation.
   The present  Court-Martial system, provided always that itsecures justice in fact, has many obvious advantages  from thepoint of view indicated above.  It provides a uniform machinewhich deals in the end with all cases of every degree of serious-ness and affords the same  standard of justice for everyone.  Itdeals equally with offences committed in distant countries andat home.  It works alike in peace and war.   Very little  reflectionwould bring home to the mind the sort  of difficulties whichmust arise in the actual oral  hearing of appeals in cases fromdistant countries, or from  the front in war-time, or where the accused  and the  witnesses belong to  a Unit which  is under orders to go abroad.   20. The Committee considers, however, that there are severaldirections  in which improvements can be  made.  The mostimportant of these is concerned with the commission of offences against the ordinary  criminal law of the land.  Section 41 ofthe  Army  and Air  Force  Acts  provides  that  with  certainexception such offences are triable by Court-Martial when com-mitted by persons subject to Military and Air Force law. Suchoffences may be charged alternatively as Service offences undervarious sections of the Army and Air Force Acts.   We mostanxiously considered whether  all such charges, at any rate whensufficiently serious to necessitate trial by jury on indictment in:the case of civilians, would not be  better so tried in the caseof persons subject to Military or Air Force law.  We also care-fully explored the suggestion that a right to elect whether hewould be tried by Court-Martial or by Civil tribunal might atsome stage be granted to the person charged with such offences.We  concluded unanimously  that  either course in addition to-raising a  host  of minor  difficulties would tend  to operateunfavourably  upon discipline  and was therefore not to  be recommended.   21. We  did,  however, arrive at the conclusion  that all civiloffences  when   committed  against  the person  or  property of civilians should be tried by the Civil Courts, unless  the Con-vening Officer certifies on  the Proceedings that for disciplinaryor other  good  military reason to be  stated in writing,  it is,desirable  that they should be tried  by Court-Martial.   A sub-stantial number of the cases in which  complaints were made-to us, as recorded in paragraph 8  of  this Report, were cases which would have been tried in the Civil Courts if the rule we^are recommending had been in force, and  it follows that these-complaints  could never have  been made.  It must in our view-be seldom, at any rate in peace-time,  that the Convening Officerwould feel it necessary to  certify for a Court-Martial in  suchcases as the above.
   22. It is the considered opinion of the Committee that if the code  of procedure  at  Courts-Martial  were better  and  more widely  understood there  would  -be a  great  reduction  in  thevolume of criticism, particularly on the part of those who con-sider  that  there  should be given to persons tried  by  Court-Martial a right of appeal comparable with that provided in theCivil  Courts.   Broadly speaking appeals  by civilians fall under two mainheads: -      (i) Appeals from convictions by Courts of Summary Juris-           diction which are heard at Quarter Sessions and are           in the  form  of  rehearings at which the evidence is           given  over again, and    (ii) Appeals  from convictions on  indictment to  the  Court           of Criminal  Appeal.  These take the  form of argu-           ments  on law  arising on  evidence  already  given,           although the Court has power (rarely exercised) to           hear fresh evidence.   The  present  system of review of  proceedings  of Courts-Martial has the advantage at any rate that it provides a uniformcode  of procedure applicable to all convictions by Courts-Martialfrom  the most trifling  to the most serious.  Advocates of the giving of a right  of appeal in all cases to the Court of criminal appeal cannot seriously have contemplated giving it in  com-paratively trifling cases which,  of course, are  far  the  mostcommon.  Two different systems of appeal therefore would haveto be envisaged.   In the  next place, the essence of the  greatmajority of military offences is  that they are offences  againstdiscipline.   They must be punished from the point of view of discipline; and they certainly would seem to be better handledat every stage by persons who are  familiar with service dis-decipline and the  general situation and  surroundings  of  officersand men.   Indeed, the Committee at a fairly early  stage were much impressed  by  the difficulty  of  giving a  right  of appeal from a Court-Martial to the Civil Courts at all.  It would seemto  follow  that new  and  untried  tribunals would  have to be-created.    We have  unanimously  come to the  conclusion  that  in  thelight  of all the facts  no such  experiment is necessary, desirable or practicable, and that  the  present system, as  a system, has fully  justified itself.  If  the  Committee&apos;s recommendation  in para. 21  is adopted,  civil trial (with  its attendant right  of appeal) will be  provided for in all  cases where discipline is unlikely to be thereby prejudiced.  This will be going as far along the road of civil appeals as the Committee think it wise to proceed directly, though  our recommendations in paras. 23, 24 and  25 should, if adopted, furnish additional safeguards.
   23. We think that a sense of grievance is often fostered bythe present system of dealing with petitions based on legal orother grounds.  After  such petitions  have been  considered inthe Judge Advocate-Generals Office it has been the invariablepractice if the petition  is not acceded to that a letter  is written to the petitioner simply announcing that the authority petitionedsees  no grounds for interfering.   The Committee  considers  that just as a Court of  Appealgives reasons  for its decisions, so at  all  events in the  case ofpetitions raising  questions of law and referred  to the judge advocate-General for his opinion, his reasons for advising theauthority petitioned should be given to the petitioner in writing.To counter-balance this  recommendation  we consider that thepresent right to continue to petition ad lib should be  curtailed.An immense amount of  public time is at present consumed indealing with whole series  of  petitions by the  same  petitioneron the same, or substantially the sarne grounds.  These in  somecases continue for years, and apparently are  likely  to do soindefinitely.   We think that once a petition has been dealt withand  dismissed for reasons stated in writing there should be anend, except upon some  entirely fresh ground which was not open to the petitioner  in the  first instance, e.g.  the  discoveryof some fresh evidence.   24. We recommend that where the Judge Advocate-Generalconsiders that a  question arises about which he  would like to hear argument he should be empowered to invite representativesof the convicted person and the Prosecution to attend before him and  argue the matter.   25. We further recommend that when the Judge Advocate-General is faced  with a point of law  of novelty or exceptionaldifficulty means  should  be provided whereby the opinion ofthe Court of Criminal Appeal upon the question can be obtained.This could  be effected by  means of a  slight  modification ofSection 19 of  of the  Criminal Appeal Act 1907.   26. Another  grievance  of  substance concerns the fact  that where there is a Judge Advocate at a Court-Martial he remainswith the Court  when it  is  closed for considering whether theCharges are  proved.  The  function  of the Judge Advocate is.to keep the  tribunal informed as to the law;  he has nothing todo with its decision on the facts,  although he  may, and  oftendoes, ask questions of witnesses for the purpose  of elucidatingthe evidence.  His summing-up takes place in  open Court andis recorded.   There seems therefore  no logical reason why heshould remain with the  Court during its deliberations.  If heis to give further directions in law the  Accused and his advocate
should certainly be  in a position  to  hear them.  Under theexisting system such directions if given are not even  recorded.Our investigations have, satisfied us that in practice the  judge advocate in closed Court acts with complete fairness and pro-priety.    Moreover he would hardly  be  likely  to commit  an obvious breach of duty in the presence not only of the Membersof the Court itself but of any young Officers who happen to beattending the Court under instruction and are present through-out the Proceedings.   Nevertheless and especially in cases inwhich the Judge Advocate has felt it his  duty to elicit facts inevidence unfavourable to the  Accused, it can easily be under-stood that the Accused and his advisers may well  regard withanxiety the retirement of the Judge Advocate with the tribunal.If after the Court has  been closed for deliberation its Membersfeel that they are not sufficiently  instructed as to  the law theCourt could  be reopened and the Judge Advocate invited tofurther  direct them  in the presence   of  the Accused and  his advisers.  We have felt some  anxiety in thus interfering  with amachinery which  has worked so  smoothly.    We  make therecommendation below  in  the  view  that  the  appearance ofjustice may be next  in  importance to the fact.   The  aboveobservations  have no reference to  the retirement of the  judge advocate with the Court when it  is closed  for consideration ofthe sentence, which is an entirely separate proceeding. We aresatisfied that the technical questions  which may arise in caseswhere sentence is being  considered make  it essential that  thespecial  skill and knowledge of the Judge Advocate  should beat the service of the tribunal.    We therefore recommend that the  Judge Advocate no longerretires with  the Tribunal when the  Court is closed for any purpose other than the consideration of sentence.    27.  The Committee has been  impressed by  evidence givenhy Service witnesses to the effect that the administration of theMilitary Code is not  always as efficient as it should  be, owingto  a lack of  knowledge on  the  part of  those who have to administer it.   This was illustrated in the Darling Committee&apos;s Report  (para.  8) by  a  statement attributed to  Field MarshalLord Cavan.         &quot;...  that the remedy for most  of the hard cases com-     plained of is to be found not so much in any great alteration     of the existing law as to the more  effective  instruction of     the proper tribunals for administering that law.&quot;    The Committee desires strongly to emphasise  the necessity for the improvement by  all possible means of the legal education of Officers of all ranks with a view to ensuring as far  as possible that the various Officers who function at Courts-Martial should
be fitted to play their respective parts.  The  comparative in-efficiency of Defending Officers was particularly stressed beforeus.   Also  the complaint,  which we  felt was not  without  sub-stance,  that when an Accused asks  for a particular  Officer todefend him he is too often told that  the services of that Officerare not available.  We think that the  strongest efforts should always be made to see that such Officer  is available.   28. The following points are suggested for consideration:       (a) In the first place  it appears  advisable that a  handbook           for  each  Service should be  prepared setting out in           a manner most convenient and helpful to members           of Courts-Martial and those appearing before them           only those portions of the Army or Air Force Acts,           Rules of  Procedure, King&apos;s  Regulations, Notes and           other portions  of  the Manuals  of  Military  or  Air           Force law  that are relevant and  can be  of any           assistance to them.     (6) The legal education of the  Officers of the  Army and           Royal Air Force is a matter which requires grave           consideration by  the Army  and Air  Councils, and           we  suggest that there should be an  Officer of the           Directorate of Legal Services, referred to elsewhere in           the Report,  in each Military and Air Force Com-           mand, who would act under the supervision of the           Director of Legal Services not only as Legal Adviser           in  all  pre-trial  questions,  but more  especially  be           available for legal instruction throughout the Com-           mand.  We further think that in matters of principle           affecting legal  education  the  Judge   Advocate-           General should be consulted.   29.  There is in the opinion of the Committee a real demandfor  skilled professional assistance  for accused  persons  in casesof difficulty, where they are not in a position by reason of lackof means to provide this  for themselves.  We  recommend thatin proper  cases legal aid should be provided on lines similarto and with safeguards comparable with the cases in which suchlegal aid  is now provided  for civilians who are prosecuted.It may be possible to defray the cost out of funds provided byfines if our recommendation in that direction is adopted; if not,it should be borne by the public purse.   30.  We further recommend that if an accused is found guiltyon  any charge or charges at the conclusion  of the  trial  thepresident should cause the finding or findings and  sentence tobe communicated to the accused under sealed cover  together    (2663)                                                c
                             tp.with an intimation that the  finding or findings  and sentenceare not valid until confirmed and that the accused has the rightto submit  a petition to the confirming or any higher authority.   A good deal of anxiety and suspense will be saved if theprivate communication recommended be promptly made.   31. It  is contemplated by the authorities that in the futuresome warrant  officers  will command  platoons  and  exercisemany of the functions  of  junior commissioned  officers.   we considered suggestions  that  such  warrant  officers  should  be qualified to sit as members of Courts-Martial.  Inasmuch as nosuch warrant officers  are yet functioning, and there is  a com-plete lack  of experience as to how the system will turn out,the Committee  does not recommend at present any change inthis  respect.  We think  that  the matter can safely be  left forfurther consideration  hereafter.   32. We think it is  of great importance that in all, or at anyrate all but the  simplest cases, a shorthand record of the pro-ceedings should  be taken and transcribed.   We had a  numberof complaints to the  effect that  the record in longhand by the judge Advocate or the President is not always accurate.  none of these complaints in  our opinion affected the  justice of theparticular  cases, but it is obviously most desirable  that  an accurate  record  of  all  Judicial  Proceedings  should  exist.Particularly  does this apply  to  a system of confirmation and review which is and  must be based entirely  upon  the record of the Proceedings and which is  not assisted by argument or there-hearing of evidence.    33. The Committee  is  further  of  opinion that a system offines in lieu  of  or in  addition to existing forms of punishmentin appropriate cases under Army and Air Force Acts should beestablished.  Care would have  to be taken, e.g. by means ofinstalment payments, not to  reduce the delinquents daily paybelow a subsistence minimum.  At the present time fines canbe awarded only for drunkenness.    Our recommendation inthis matter is that in  the case of other ranks the fine should beat  the option of the party  charged,  but that  in  the  case ofofficers there being for them  no punishment between dismissaland forfeiture of seniority of rank, such option  should not begiven.    34. We recommend that in cases where  a Summary ofEvidence is taken (an officer can waive his right to a summaryand be content with an Abstract) it should be taken on  oath.    35. We further recommend that the Members as well as the President  of a Court-Martial  should be supplied confidentially,in  advance,  with a copy of the charge sheet.   This will enable them to familiarize themselves  with  the nature of the chargesthey have to try and the issues which will arise for their decision.
   36. It has come to our notice that persons  subject to  theArmy or Air Force Acts  charged with offences thereunder  arenot always familiar with  the  rights  which those Acts and  theRules of Procedure give them.  We think that steps should betaken to ensure that effect is  given  to the recommendation inparagraph 45 of the Report of the Darling Committee that thereshould be  on the wall of  every guard room and cell a printedcard explaining in simple  language the rights of a soldier whenbrought up on a charge and when remanded for trial by Court-Martial.   37. The  Committee  desire  to  place   on  record  theiracknowledgment of the valuable assistance rendered them bytheir Secretary, Major W. R. F. Osmond, and  their assistant secretary, Mr. H.  H. Hobbs, and to  express their thanks to-them for their constant attention.                   (Sgd.)  ROLAND  OLIVER,                          TRISTRAM  BERESFORD.
