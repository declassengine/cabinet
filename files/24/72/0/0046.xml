The Officers exercising this power will be held responsible that such information is imparted with due caution and reserve.   It is intended that matters which seem to be of value to those engaged in anti-Submarine work, such as new systems of patrol and methods of attack,shall be referred to in this publication.   Accordingly it is requested :-       (a) That Anti-Submarine Patrol reports from the various Commands          should give full details of any novel system or idea which promises          better results.       (b) That all Officers and ratings engaged in Anti-Submarine Operations          from the air, or in collating intelligence, should have an opportunity          of studying this publication.infraction of the Official Secrets Act./includingNAVAL STAFF,   AIR DIVISION.(240)
                             NORTH  SEA.   Operations (other than Anti-Submarine) carried out by Aircraft during                           September, 1918.    Yarmouth,  September 16th.-Large  America  Seaplanes,  Nos. N.4550and N.4549 and D.H. 9 Aeroplane D.5709, with a D.H. 4 from Covehithe, whilston a  hostile  aircraft patrol, engaged five hostile machines  12 miles  E. ofShipwash  Light Vessel.  One of our machines was forced  to land owing trengine trouble and was repaired on the water. The enemy was hotly engagedby the remaining machines, and No. 4549 claims to have damaged one of theenemy aircraft which was  seen to be on fire, and is thought to have  been destroyed.    The remainder of the enemy aircraft turned East followed by our machineswhich were unable to overtake them owing to the superior speed of the enemy.                   NO. 5  GROUP,  DOVER PATROL.                             (Overseas Unit.)     During the first part of the month under review, the weather was generallyunfavourable for flying, although favourable during the latter part.  Nigbombing, however, has been seriously hampered raids being possible on fournights only.                           RECONNAISSANCE.     Photographic, W/T., and Coastal Reconnaissances have been carried out Iin spite of unfavourable weather.  Photographs show that Aerodromes round 1Dunkirk are being enlarged, and are particularly active.  An unusually large *number  of cargo vessels were found in the Canal by the Solway Factory,and it is thought that they were being used for the purpose of bringing material for the Dudzeele Dump which  appears to be growing rapidly.  Photographswere taken of  Uytkerke Aerodrome after a raid which.showed  the successachieved one hangar was  seen to be  completely burnt out.  Several otherhangars and the living quarters had also received direct hits.  During a bombraid on Bruges photographs were taken which show  that  at least one largeDestroyer and one of the large Floating Docks have been severely damaged.Another Destroyer which was afloat two days before, and which was claimed to have been, hit, was observed from the photographs to be placed in one ofthe Floating Docks.  No submarines have been seen at Bruges for some time,and it would appear that these Docks are no longer used as a Submarine Base,                            BOMBING  RAIDS.     Objects of  military importance and enemy shipping have been attackedlwith success whenever the weather permitted.  A direct hit was obtained onlan. enemy vessel lying abreast  of the &quot; Vindictive &quot; off Ostende.  Raids werejcarried out on aerodromes where fires were started.     Units other than No. 5 Group have assisted  in the bombing  raids.  Thejsummary of bombs dropped is given in page 5.                            ENEMY  AIRCRAFT.     Engagements with enemy  aircraft have been  above  normal, and havlresulted in 56 enemy aircraft being destroyed and 48 being driven down oujof control.  Total 104.                                 .     No.  210 Squadron whilst  on an offensive  patrol engaged seven FOKTEJbiplanes over Lille.  Lieut. W.  S. Jenkins dived on the lowest enemy machin&apos;1
 firing 300 rounds at 50 yards range, after which the machine side-slipped, and went down out of control.  Whilst on another patrol the same squadron engaged six Fokker biplanes  over  Roulers at 6,000 ft.  A lively fight ensued lasting 15 minutes in which Captain W. A. Patey attacked  an enemy aircraft, at a range of 30 ft. which was seen to crash in flames.  Lieut. E. Swale shot down another machine which was also seen to crash.  Captain Joseph co-operating with Licuts.  Payton, Sanderson, Hughes and  Lewis, drove down one  Fokker biplane which crashed.    On September 16th, whilst on a photographic patrol,  No. 202 Squadron was  attacked by five Phalz Scouts,  which were reinforced by eight  Fokker biplanes, and one Fokker monoplane.  Captain Keeble (pilot)  and Captain Betts (observer),  destroyed two enemy machines, one of which went down in ilames, and the other crashed.  Lieut. Pearson  (pilot) and 2nd Lieut. Darby (observer) shot down one enemy aircraft in flames, and drove another down out of control.    Whilst on a  high offensive patrol of nineteen machines, No. 204 Squadron engaged approximately 14 Fokkcr biplanes between Ostende and Blankenberghe. Lieuts. Bennett and Cormack each shot clown Fokker biplanes. One two-seater machine was shot down  and  seen  to  crash by Lieut.  G.  E.  C. Howard. Captain C. R. R. Hickey  shot down one  Fokker biplane in flames,  and in conjunction with Lieuts.  Bennett,  Smith, Chisman  and Bayley, shot down another biplane in flames.  Lieut. W. B. Craig  shot down a machine, the lower port  plane of which was shot off.  Four  Fokker biplanes,  and one-two-seater were driven down out of control by Captain Hickey and Lieuts. Craig (2) Kelby and Howard.  In all, six  enemy aircraft were destroyed, and five machines were driven down out of control.  All our machines returned safely.    On September 29th,  No. 210  Squadron  whilst on offensive  patrol, was attacked by 15 Fokker biplanes near  Staden.  A fierce fight  ensued during which Captain E. Swale, and Lieuts. Buchanan, Welsh, Hopkins,  Payton, andjJenkins, each shot down machines which were seen to crash.  Lieuts. Boultonand Buchanan each shot down machines out of  control. In this fight six enemy machines were destroyed and two shot down out of control.  One of our machines was lost.   In addition to the  above, other enemy machines have been destroyed orshot down out of control by the following pilots and observers :                                             Destroyed,Lieut. E.

General Remarks. Statistics for the month of September are based on figures for the foureks ending September 28th,  1918. During this period Aircraft (excluding Kite Balloons) engaged on anti-)marine work in Home Waters have carried out 4,304 patrols, covering a
distance of 500,995 miles.  Of this distance, 432,576 miles have been flown bySeaplanes and Aeroplanes, and 68,419 miles by Airships.  The total time in theair for Seaplanes, Aeroplanes and Airships is approximately 10,168 hours.    Submarines have been sighted and attacked on the following occasions                                                       Submarines.           Date.               Station.              Sighted.

Course was altered to attack, and one 230-lb. bomb  was  released at 125Swhich detonated 15  yards astern of the conning tower.  One minute later isecond 230-lb. bomb was dropped,  which exploded  about 20 yards aheadthe submarine which had submerged.  Oil and bubbles were  observed on thfsurface, but nothing further was seen.    No surface craft was  observed in the vicinity, and the aeroplane returnedto base at once and reported.    New  Haggerston,  September 11th-Aeroplane D.H. 6, No. 7336 (PilotCaptain  Kennedy),  whilst  returning from  an escort patrol  on  accountdarkness,  sighted a submarine at 2045 in position 52 S.   One bomb was droppedbut no results could be observed owing to the failing light.    Padstow,September 18th-AeroplaneD.H. 9, No.  7613 (Pilot, Lieut. SaleObserver, Lieut. Hewitt),  whilst on patrol at 1710, sighted a periscope one fobabove the surface, travelling E. by N. at a speed of about four knots, in positioi50o 36&apos; N. 50 11&apos; W.  Attack was impossible,  owing to the heavy  mist, untireturning to the position at 1720 when the mist had cleared.  At this sightinjthe periscope was observed to be  travelling E. at the same  speed  as beforefollowed by an almost  invisible streak of oil about two feet wide.  One 100-1&apos;bomb (two and a half seconds delay)  was dropped  from 1,000 feet,  whiciexploded  about 25 feet to starboard of the periscope.  Upon  the exploding ithe bomb the periscope started to submerge, and another bomb was dropjXfrom  800  feet, which fell  10 feet in advance, and to the starboard  side of fperiscope, but failed  to  explode.  The periscope immediately disappearsleaving only a small swirl.    Fourteen minutes after the dropping of the second bomb a submarilchaser arrived over the  position,  having been communicated with by tljaeroplane.    Low  clouds and mist making further observation  impossible, the machiijreturned  to base leaving the  submarine chaser circling the position of tljsubmarine,

Rosyth&apos;s Report on General Working of         Scandinavian Convoy System for the month  of September, 1918.        On 29th  September, at 1330 Airship  &quot; R.29 &quot;  from East  Fortune, in    company with convoy &quot; T.M.9,&quot; observed oil rising in position lat. 550 12&apos; 5&quot; N.,    long. I0 22&apos; 20&quot; W., H.M.S. &quot; OUSE &quot;  was informed by visual signal  and a    230-lb. bomb was then dropped on the oil patch.  Depth charges were dropped    by destroyers and hydrophone trawlers  in the  vicinity, and at 1400 a second    230-lb. bomb was released from the airship.  Both bombs exploded in correct    position ahead of oil patch. A signal to the effect that a submarine in a damaged    condition had been located by the hydrophone  force, was intercepted later.        On the same  date  an airship from Longside, which was escorting an oiler,    sighted a submarine 12 miles distant in a position  40 miles to the Eastward of    Peterhead.  The submarine  was forced to dive, no attack being made on the    oiler.        There  appears to be no  doubt of the value of aircraft protection in these    waters,  it is hoped that in  the event of winter conditions preventing airship    co-operation every possible assistance will be afforded to convoys by seaplanes    and flying-boats.                      FRENCH NAVAL  AIR  SERVICE.       During the month of August, 1918, the French Naval Air Service (excluding    Kite Balloons) carried  out 4,574 anti-submarine patrols, covering a  distance    of 572,720 miles.   Of this distance 495,700 miles were flown by seaplanes and    aeroplanes, and 77,020 miles  by airships.       Submarines were attacked on 12 occasions, and mines were sighted on oil  8 occasions.       Statistics of the work done in the various areas are given in Tables D, E,    and F, pages       The following are details of attacks :-       Camaret, August 3rd.--In answer to a signal  three machines set out to   search the suspected area in position 9 miles N.W. of Penmarc&apos;h, where a vessel   had previously been sunk. The shadow  of a submarine, followed by a wash,   was seen and two  bombs were dropped ahead of the wash by one machine  I followed by a second machine which dropped two more bombs on the same     (240)                                                             c2
iOit position.  Ten minutes iater a periscope was seen and a bomb was droppc which exploded just ahead of the periscope.  Nothing further was seen of tin submarine, and surface craft and Base were informed by message buoys and W/T respectively.     Guernsey, August 9th.-Two seaplanes whilst on patrol, at 0815, sightce a submarine rise to the surface and steer East in  position 30 miles N. aril 80 W. from Guernsey.     The submarine made no reply to signals sent, but dived rapidly when joint miles distant.  Four bombs (one of which failed to explode) were dropped oil wash left by the submarine on submerging.  Surface; craft and Base wen informed, and patrols were sent out during the day without result.     La Pallice, August 10th.-(1) Two seaplanes, whilst on escort patrol, at 0730, sighted the conning tower of a submarine, 14 miles W. of the Cotmiere Course was altered to attack, and two bombs were dropped on the periscope and form of the submarine which were still visible below the surface.  After!11 the  attack oil and bubbles rose to the surface.  Surface craft were  informed, but  owing to defective W/T an ALLO was not sent to Base.     (2) A patrol sent from Base in search  of the enemy sighted the submarine at 0925, two miles away from its  former position.  One of the pilots saw wh he thought to be another periscope which  dived on his approach bombs were dropped on both positions.   The machines searched the area, but  observed nothing further so returned to Base.     (3) The submarine was sighted again at 1415 by another patrol and bomb were dropped, and the area well searched.     Ten  bombs were dropped on this position,  all of  which exploded, and three of which were well placed. Important convoys were able to pass through the  area without being molested.     Havre, August 10th. Two seaplanes  patrolling ahead of a convoy E. oi Barfleur  sighted  an airship  bombing a suspicious  upheaval.  The seaplanes attacked the position at 1415 with four bombs, which resulted in oil rising to the  surface.  The convoy was warned, and a vessel directed to the spot, which dropped  depth charges on the disturbance.  Patrols searched the area during the  day without result.     Dunkirk, August 11th. One of two machines on patrol having returned to Base owing to engine trouble, the other proceeded alone, and at 0525 sighted a half-submerged submarine steering N.E. in position 25 miles N.  and 40 W, of Dunkirk.   The submarine submerged but was still visible below the surface when two bombs were dropped, both of which exploded near the conning tower, An  oil patch appeared on the surface but no further results were observed,&apos; and the machine returned to Base.   Other patrols were sent out and bombs were dropped on the oil patch and rising  bubbles thought  to be coming from the submarine while lying on the bottom.     &quot; It is probable that this submarine was damaged, but not destroyed.&quot;  It     Dunkirk, August 11th.-A patrol composed of one  triplane and fouijs seaplanes set out at 0500.   A submarine was sighted 0553 in position 30 miles! t N. and 20 W. of Dunkirk, steering in a N.-Easterly direction.  The submarine! r dived two minutes before the attack, and was hardly visible when two bombs! r were dropped.  A circular wash appeared after the bombing.   Surface craft were informed and as nothing further was to be seen of the submarine, the machines returned to Base.     Guernsey, August llth.--A flight of  seaplanes whilst  on  patrol at 0159, sighted a black patch 12 miles N.W.  of the Casquets, towards which course was altered.  On investigation a dark shadow was seen, and later the conning tower of a submarine was observed which disappeared immediately on the dropping of two bombs.   Four bombs were dropped, one of which failed ot explode. A pigeon was released reporting to Base and after searching the positionwinVirraiPS(oTSib0a!ohaI

I    Four minutes after the attack, the  bows of the submarine appeared to be,  NJERY slanting, but it eventually disappeared  changing course, on  totally sub- u jierging. Nothing further was seen with the exception of an oil track in the   ttacked position.   It is  considered that this  submarine was damaged and  oierhaps destroyed.an,e    Bizerte,  August 26th.-In answer to a signal received at Base, a patroljvjet out in search of the reported submarine.  At 0750 a submarine was  sighted   n  the surface steering South about 22 miles N.  of Pantellaria.      The submarine remained on the surface, and the machines passed over it.   wo bombs  were dropped which exploded abeam the  conning tower.  The   submarine dived rapidly leaving  a  muddy patch on  the surface.  Two more  lorribs were dropped on the position where the submarine submerged-neither   f these two exploded.  By this time the submarine had completely disappeared,  ind nothing further was  seen except the oil patch which was still  apparent  in  the following day. *      Guernsey, August 30th.-A patrol of seaplanes whilst on patrol  sighted  a  ong wake and altered course to investigate.  On reaching the position oil and  ur  bubbles were observed and a long shadow was observed below the surface.  t was known that a French submarine was operating in this area, and therefore  the position was run over three times in order to  ascertain the nationality of the  submarine.  No recognition signals were observed, so four bombs were dropped  .o the fore of the conning tower.  All  the bombs  exploded satisfactorily.  Nothing further  was  observed and  the machines  returned to Base after  reporting by W/T.                               AIRSHIPS.          v     Guipavas, August 10th.-Airship C.M.4 whilst on&quot;escort patrol sighted a  submarine in an attacking position turned towards  the  hull of  the leading  vessel.  The submarine taken by  surprise-on seeing the airship  immerge  from a cloud submerged rapidly and deeply.     The convoy was broken up and a zigzag course was steered.  The submarine  was sighted once more at 1205 and an American vessel and a patrol boat dropped  depth charges in the vicinity.hicltin.neitecW.ACEL&apos;er,eclbs)m
    At 1250, in a position 4&apos; from the scene of attack, an elongated sandypatch was observed, as if the submarine was resting on the  bottom.

MEDITERRANEAN  REPORT  OF AIR  OPERATIONS.lrSECTION I.hANTI-SUBMARINE REPORT  AND  STATISTICAL  TABLES.      AEGEAN GROUP.(25th August-21st September.)w     Routine dawn patrols have been carried out by seaplanes from  Talikna (Lemnos),  Suda, Syra and Skyros and other submarine,  swept  channel and escort patrols have been performed as required.     On the 27th August at 1843 G.M.T. a seaplane  left Talikna on a special long-distance night reconnaissance of  the Sea of Marmora and failed to  return.  F    Attacks  on enemy submarines.-On  30th  August, at 1509 G.M.T., a 1 Baby Sopwith sighted a submarine in lat. 40o 42&apos; N., 230 421&apos; E., the periscope only being above the surface.  The submarine was first sighted from a height of P 4,500 feet, and the seaplane at once dived and, whilst so doing, saw a torpedo miss one of H.M. ships.  From a height of 1,000 feet a 16-lb. bomb was dropped * and, on seeing it was  short, the seaplane went up closer and dropped two more 16-lb.  bombs. Submarine then completely submerged and a trawler arrived on the scene.    On. 2nd  September  at 1120 G.M.T., D.H. 9,  whilst  on  patrol  in lat. 40o 27&apos; N., long. 230  55&apos; E.,  sighted  a submarine  submerged.   At the time of sighting  the machine was at an altitude of 600 feet, and only the periscope, which  was  travelling N.E., was visible.  The periscope submerged after the first bomb was released, but  before it reached the water, the bomb exploding in the wash left by the periscopes.  A second similar bomb 100 lb. exploded close by the first, but the resultant patch on the surface of the water was quite a different colour to the first  which was light brown. It is estimated that the first bomb exploded 15 to 20 feet, and the second one 100 feet, from  the hull of the submarine.    A second D.H. 9 and a Baby Sopwith now arrived on the scene, and the former  dropped one  100-lb.  bomb  near the spot where the  other bombsExploded, and the latter machine dropped four 16-lb. bombs in the same place, within ten minutes of the disappearance of the periscopes.    Subsequently thin oil was  observed leading from the above, spot to the I entrance of the bay, and, assuming that  the  submarine might have been I crippled and was endeavouring to escape, another  100-lb.  bomb was  dropped at the end of the oil streak. Nothing further was observed.    On the 20th September a hostile submarine was sighted three miles away by a D.H. 9 but dived before an attack could be made.    On several occasions British and  French warships have been escorted and spotted for.    Otranto-On the 2nd September, at 1457, a Short seaplane was sent outon a special patrol on a south-westerly course, information having been received that an enemy submarine was expected to pass the Barrage, homeward bound,at about 1600.   The seaplane remained on patrol for two hours and five minutesbut sighted nothing unusual.       ADRIATIC GROUP.(1st September 28th September.)            66 Wing.
 aipe ofBo        On the 6th September information was received that two Italian Chaser    ioats which had left Brindisi for Valona had not returned.    A Short seaplane    /as accordingly sent on an emergency patrol to assist certain Italian machines    i searching  for the missing boats.   The flight  was also an anti-submarine    iatrol as bombs were carried, but the machine returned after a patrol of two    ours and twenty-five minutes without having sighted either the chaser boats or    ostile under-water craft.        On the  19th  September at  1035 a hostile  submarine  was reported in    at. 39&apos;  57s N., long. 19&apos; 07c E., and this information was  transmitted by    tireless to a Short seaplane which was then on patrol.  The machine proceeded    o the position but observed nothing abnormal although it remained out for   . director hours.;na!j11(1 :                              om  m.                                  67  Wing.tall   Santa Maria di leuca.-At 1535 on the 25th August a signal was receivedj,  Jrom the Hydrophone Station stating that a submarine was heard at 1525.  At    600 a Sopwith Baby left and  sighting a destroyer 11 miles N.E. of Leuca    ropped a  message to  it, giving the  hydrophone signal.  &apos;Llie  message was    )icked up and apparently acted upon immediately.       On  the 7th September at 0545 a signal was received from S.O. Barrage,^dlhne of  origin  0102, requesting a reconnaissance  of  moored  minefield.  All    nachines were  already on patrol, and having patrolled that area, on their    oturn a  message was sent at 1032 to S.O. Barrage, informing him that machines    lad returned with nothing to report,  but two machines would again patrol the   irea that evening.  These patrols were carried out and machines again returned   vith  nothing  unusual  to  report, so S.O.  Barrage  was informed accordingly,   (it 1807.       On the 11th September a Hamble Baby and a Sopwith Baby left on routine   patrol at 1510 and 1515 respectively and were returning to Base at 1658 when   the Sopwith observed a long  brown track on the  water north and south,  a   niarter of a mile to  the east of Leuca Lighthouse.  At first this was thought to   be spume gathered up by the tide, but upon observing it closely a large swirl was   noticedfor about one minute and a white foam to the north of the track.   This   tvas repeated after about three minutes, so a 65-lb.  bomb was  dropped almost    pon  the swirl.  Two red Very&apos;s lights  were fired to attract the attention of   the second machine which, however, proceeded to land at Base, not noticing the   Very&apos;s lights.  The  Sopwith machine then returned and  reported and at 1710    ie Hamble Baby was re-despatched to position bombed, but could observe   nothing owing to darkness, and  had  to return at  1725.   While the first two   machines were away on patrol an ALLO signal was  received  at  1525 from   S.O.  Auxiliary Patrol Line giving the position of a suspected submarine as   lat. 390 58&apos;  N.,  long.  1*80  49&apos; E.  at 1345.   This was about 11 miles N.E. of   the position bombed and it is possible that the submarine had travelled  S.W..   approaching the coast too close inshore to be heard by Leuca fixed hydrophone.      After several test flights moonlight patrols were carried out on the 19th,  20th, and 21st September, but nothing suspicious was sighted.  However,  much  valuable work has been  done in  training both pilots and observers for  night  flying.  Ships of all classes have been easily recognised by the light of the  moon  from a height of 2,000 feet, and with the aid of an Aldis lamp trained upon a ship  its type can be easily ascertained.     Taranto. On the 4th September a Short seaplane left at 0835 to escort  a convoy into Taranto which it picked up at 0935 and left at Taranto at  1305.     At 0430 on the  19th September a Short seaplane left at 0430 to meet a llarge convoy which was expected  to be in a named position at 0530 bound for ITaranto.  At 0627 information was received that the  convoy was five hours&apos; late and consequently the Short returned at 0915 without having sighted it.
    At 1015 another Short proceeded to the position, and picking up the convoy,proceeded to escort it.  This machine was relieved  later by another Shoiwhich  continued the escort until the  convoy  was inside the Mare Grande ;1430.    On the 23rd September a convoy of merchantmen  was observed by aShort seaplane  whilst on patrol  and was  escorted into  Gallipoli harbour.    On the 26th September a Short seaplane when on patrol 46 miles soutlof St,  Vito, sighted four  large patches of oil connected  by numerous smapatches and streaks.   A 230-lb. bomb of 15  seconds&apos;  delay action  fuse wasreleased, and dropped on the most northerly and largest patch.   The Base waithen informed by W/T, giving the position and time.  No visible result waiseen and no surface craft was in sight to continue the hunt,  so the machinpatrolled the vicinity  for one hour, and, as  nothing  further  was observecreturned  to  Base.     Kite Balloons, Brindisi.-Practically a continuous patrol has been kept up during the period under review.     On the 9th September, Balloon M.M. 133 left on its eighth patrol, but the fabric of the stabtlisers rapidly deteriorated, resulting in the nose blowing in loss of gas and consequent instability.   However, this did not prevent usiia watches being kept and the whole patrol was  carried out.     On the evening of the 12th September a suspicious object, possibly a sub&apos; marine, was reported from  the basket of a balloon which was then  on patrol Owing to the object being  twenty miles away and to the light failing and it being obviously impossible  to cover more than a third of the distance before darkness fell,  the Commanding  Officer decided not to investigate.     On the morning of the 13th September several suspicious and apparently new oil patches were  sighted from the same balloon. The ship was headed for them and a search made near the spot and hydrophones used, but nothing was seen or heard.     During a patrol from the 18th to 21st September a low mist was encounter tered over which the observers in the balloon were able to see. Bearings were given on prominent landmarks and the ship was conned into clear water,,                             EGYPT GROUP,                      (18th August-14th September.) -     The usual  anti-submarine patrols have been regularly carried out.                          GIBRALTAR GROUP.                      (18th August-28th September.)     During the period under review the usual seaplane and kite balloon patrols have been carried out.                            MALTA GROUP.                      (7th September-5th October.)     Regular anti-submarine patrols have been carried out as far as possible, but activity has been rather curtailed owing to lack of pilots, caused by threelarge America machines with six pilots being away from the Station during most of the month.  Two of these were operating on the North African coast,and  details of their work are given in Section III. of this Report.    The third was  successfully flown to  Egypt via  Otranto  and Suda Baj&apos;^Crete, waiting at the latter place to escort a Handley-Page which was also oJpassage from England to Egypt.

On the same night raids were carried out on Galata aerodrome and Nagat Seaplane Base.  In the first raid  the bombs fell 40. yards south of the hangar and  the machines then dived low and machined-gunned them.  Heavy gu fire from machine  guns was experienced at Galata and  heavy  anti-aircral barrage fire over Suvla.    The second raid was carried  out  by a D.H.9 and two Sopwith  bombc&quot; Owing  to engine trouble one of the Sopwiths was forced to return, the boni carried being dropped on Gaba Tepe.  No direct hits on the sheds were obtained but damage was probably caused by splinters.  Anti-aircraft fire was mediu but inaccurate.    27th August. Raids were again carried out on the last two objectives. D.H.9  and a Sopwith bomber carried out the first raid and  dropped bom close to the  sheds.   Anti-aircraft fire was medium in intensity but  general! inaccurate.    A D.H.4 carried out the second raid, the bombs dropping near the quarteand tents.  Anti-aircraft fire was very inaccurate.  A raid was also carried oby five Sopwith Camels on  anti-aircraft guns in the vicinity, but the visibili]was poor and only one gun was observed. This was bombed as also were tsearchlights at Nagara and Helles.  .

Bombing Attack on Cattaro, 6th September.    At 0430 a formation of five D.H. machines (3 D.H. 9&apos;s and two D.H. 4&apos;s)left Andrano carrying 1,804 lbs. of bombs and 80 incendiaries.  A Large Americaand two Short seaplanes acted as escort.    One  of the machines was forced to return owing to engine trouble butthe remaining four reached the objective at 0735.  One 230-lb. bomb fell near the jetty at the Austrian Submarine Base and another close to three submarinesmoored off the same.  Two 112-lb. bombs were observed to make direct hitson the submarine crews&apos; quarters, causing a lire  to break out.   One 230-lb,bomb fell just over the seaplane base across the roadway, and  two 112-lb.bombs close to the seaplane sheds, between the submarine quarters,  and the seaplane  base.  A  number  of incendiaries were  dropped  over  the seaplanebase, the  effects of which could not be observed.    Thirty incendiaries were also dropped on Igalo aerodrome.    Anti-aircraft fire was accurate and fairly heavy.  As the machines were leaving the Gulf they were attacked by six scouts, probably of the Rolanctype, which endeavoured to break up the formation.   One D.H. machine was hit repeatedly in the tail  and the rudder controls were partly shot away buton the observer firing 190 rounds into the fastest  enemy machine it broke ofthe fight  and attacked  another D.H. machine which immediately caught fire and fell into the sea from a height of about 10,000 feet.    The hostile scouts showed eagerness to attack and maintained a runningfight with the formation for about 30  minutes.        Bombing Attack on San Giovanni di Medua, 11th September.    Four  D.H. machines  from  No.  66 Wing, accompanied  by five similarmachines from No. 67 Wing, left  at 0630 carrying 3,154 lbs. of bombs and 30Baby Incendiaries.  A Large America and two Short seaplanes acted as escort.    Two machines were obliged to leave the formation through engine troubleon the  outward  journey, but the  remaining  seven  machines  reached the objective.   Two large merchant vessels and a Torpedo Boat which were lyingat the quay made the  principal target and the following hits were observecto have been made :          One 230-lb. and four 112-lb. bombs on the N.W. corner.        One 230-lb. bomb on the west side.        Four 112-lb. bombs close to the two vessels already referred to.        One 230-lb.  bomb on the beach on the east side of the bay,  possibly            damaging the railway on the fore-shore.        A direct  hit  with one  112-lb. bomb which burst among moving            transport  on the main road close to the camp situated  about             half a mile south of the quay, and        One 112-lb. bomb on the railway sidings near the shore.    The  machines then proceeded to Alessio where thirty incendiary bombs were dropped on a camp situated on the eastern side of the main road betweenSan Giovanni di Medua and Alessio, causing a fire  which was still burning whenthe machines were 10 miles distant.    Anti-aircraft fire was slight and no hostile machines were encountered.              Bombing Attack  on  Durazzo, 17th September.    Eleven machines, from 66 and 67 Wings, left at 0440 carrying 4,952 lbs.of bombs and 90 Baby Incendiaries.   Four Camels had orders to act as escortuntil the bombing machine had  reached their objective and  then to proceedto Kavaja and &quot; shoot up &quot; the aerodrome there.
&apos;s)cautarcsts).Xiele2516    Ten bombing machines reached Durazzo at 0630 and the bomb-dropping was as follows :              Two 112-lb. bombs made direct hits on the western jetty of the         Seaplane Base, and two more fell at the end of the slipway.  Three         112-lb. bombs exploded on buildings adjacent to the Seaplane Base,         causing a fire  to break out.  One 112-lb. bomb fell in the centre of         a new aerodrome which was located just outside the town due north of         the Seaplane Base.            Eight 112-lb. and one 230-lb. bombs and a number of incendiaries         were also dropped on the railway sidings and dumps at Durazzo. A         fire broke out from which dense columns of smoke were  given off,         and  this prevented the effect of other  bombs which  were dropped         at this point being observed.  This fire, and the outbreak caused near         the Seaplane Base,  were  visible for 30  minutes after the machines         had left Durazzo.            Two direct hits with 112-lb. bombs were also obtained on a clump        about three miles south of Durazzo on the Durazzo-Kavaj a road.    On  the return journey a D.H. machine developed engine trouble  and vent down  on the sea about 20 miles on a bearing of 60o from Otranto.  Both Jilot and Observer were picked up by an Italian Destroyer.&apos;    The  anti-aircraft fire at Durazzo  was  heavy but inaccurate. No hostile nachines were encountered.    After escorting the D.H. machines  to Durazzo the Camel formation headed or Kavaj a.  The machines went clown  to the level of the two hangars there and me hostile  machine  was standing on&apos; the ground  covered  with tarpaulin. Eighty incendiary bombs were dropped from under 100 ft., and 700 rounds required  into the sheds and at the hostile machine on the ground, which must havelicen considerably damaged.             Bombing Attack on Rogozina, 21st September.    At 0600 five D.H. machines left escorted by four Camels.    The  bombing formation dropped three 230-lb. and twelve 112-lb. bombs in the camp.  Two direct hits were obtained on the sidings and three bombs xploded amongst buildings west of the hospital.  The remainder of the bombs^11 fell  in  the immediate vicinity of the camp, probably doing damage.    Baby incendiary bombs were dropped by a Camel and caused a fire toireak out among the  hutments.  This machine also reports that the bombs ropped by  the D.H. machines caused three other smaller fires.    One  D.H.  machine &quot;apparently developed engine trouble or perhaps was amaged by anti-aircraft fire, for she endeavoured to make Valona.  Unfor-unately, however, the machine came down some 3,000 yards inside the Austrianines, near Poiani, and both occupants were made prisoners.   Italian artillery,iccording  to the latest report, was endeavouring to destroy the  machine.                        FIGHTER  PATROLS.   The following are particulars of Offensive Patrols  carried out by Camelnachines operating with No..225 Squadron from Valona :    1           On the 26th August three  Camels flew  over  Kuchi,  Lyushna,       Segas and Fieri.  Very little movement of enemy troops was observed       in this district and the anti-aircraft fire was negligible.           On the 27th August three Camels left at  0509 on an Offensive       Patrol over Fieri, Kuchi, Lyushna and Berat.  No hostile aircraft      were sighted, and anti-aircraft  fire at Lyushna was erratic.   Nothing       of importance was observed.
               On the 27th August six Camels left.at 1529 to act as escort          D.H. machines from  Andrano engaged in bombing a hostile can          reported to be situated 6 miles  S.S.W. of Lyushna.  The bombii          formation was not sighted, having left after finding that the &quot; camp5          was  an array of  haycocks  covered  with canvas.  The Camels thi          proceeded to Lake Kranasta where a large camp was located on tl          eastern shore of the Lake.  An ammunition dump was observed i i          be on fire and a number of sailors were endeavouring  to put it on          The formation dived to 100 feet and  fired about 2,000 rounds into tl          camp and the men  working on the burning clump.              At  1520 on the 29th August four Camels left on an  Offensii          Patrol.  About two to three miles north of Ciplaka a number of lo          huts were seen at the  foot of a range of hills.  Shots were fired int          these buildings.              Three machines again patrolled  the region of Fieri, Kuchi, an          Berat on the 3rd September, but nothing of importance was noted,             On the 5th September three Camels proceeded to Tirana  aero          drome and two  large  machines  were  observed on  the  aerodrom          outside the hangars.  The Camels fired Very&apos;s lights and came dow          to 100 feet, but neither of the hostile machines attempted to get o          the ground.  The Camel formation then fired about 1,000 rounds a          the two hostile machines and the hangars, into  which tracers wei          observed to go.  One hostile machine was observed flying at a heigl          of 1,000 feet two miles  south of Tirana by a Camel which according!          climbed to  1,500 feet and proceeded to attack.  When close to tt          hostile machine the Camel dived  firing both guns  and the formt          was observed to dive steeply while close to the ground, but was nt          actually  seen to crash.   Anti-aircraft fire was good both at Than          and over Rogozina.     Three Camels carried out a patrol in the  region of Fieri, Drenovoca an Kuchi  on the  6th September.  Nothing  of importance was  seen  with tt exception of a motor lorry which was fired at and was seen to swerve an overturn and then catch on fire, and a considerable number of horses, cattle an mules which were grazing near Drenovoca were attacked and killed.     On the 9th September  three Camels left on an Offensive Patrol  at 1531 Nothing unusual was seen at Berat, Orjana or Boka, but  at Ura-Hassan or motor lorry was observed on the road moving south towards Kuchi, while second lorry was seen on the road near Kuchi,  north of the bridge, procecdin towards Lyrrshna.  At Drenovoca a mule cart  was sighted, but owing to h visibility it was not possible to observe  any movement. Fieri town was see; to be covered with low-lying smoke from  fires on the surrounding high grounc No hostile aircraft were encountered and anti-aircraft fire was slight.     At  1510 on the T 1th September three Camels left on an Offensive Patro&apos; but one  machine soon after leaving was forced to return owing to engine troublf No enemy movement was observed in  the neighbourhood of  Berat or a Tomorica Maja.     At Fieri nothing of importance was noticed.     At  Tormorica three small fires were seen, probably cooking fires, but n actual troops or transport were noticed.
