Reply addressed to the Army Council by the Minister of Pensions, with reference to the letter from Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig (G.T.6431).

17th December, 1918.

Sir,

With reference to your letter 100/Gen.No./5755 (C.1.) of the 5th instant, forwarding a copy of a letter from the Field Marshal Commander-in-Chief the British Armies in France on the subject of the welfare of officers disabled in the war, I am directed by the Minister of Pensions to state that he cannot but regret that the Army Council should have submitted to the War Cabinet, apparently without correction, a letter which appears to be based upon misconceptions of the steps which have been taken to provide for the pensions and after-care of disabled officers. The Cabinet might not unnaturally suppose that the Field Marshal&apos;s letter correctly  represents the facts, and the Minister is therefore causing a copy of this reply to be sent to them. He hopes that the Council will at once taxe steps to enlighten Sir Douglas Haig as to the actual position, and that in  any future matter of the kind they will consult this Ministry.

The position may be shown by the following brief comments on the successive paragraphs of the letter.

Para. 1. Officers have received the same consideration as men. The Warrant issued in 1917 as to pensions for men was followed by one for officers. A copy of this Warrant was sent to the Field Marshal Commander-in-Chief  with ? Office letter 22/?ounds/97 of the 21st August 1917, in reply to his of the 17th April 1917, No. 24084. The Warrant was dated 1st August 1917, and issued as No. 268 in September Army Orders.

Para. 2. The supposition in this paragraph is quite erroneous. Officers receive disability retired pay under the Warrant quoted.

Para. 3. Officers holding permanent commissions in the Regular Army have the special benefit of Article 1 (2)  of that Warrant. That may be traine for a new career under Article 7, and if they are fairly senior in rank before the war, are likely to benefit from alternative retired may under Article 3.

Temporary, Territorial, and special Reserve Officers who relinquished good positions to join the Army may also be ? by alternative retired pay; and many of the younger officers whose eduction was interrupted may receive training either under Article 7 or under the schemes announced on the 14th instant by the Government.

Para. 4. The same general remarks apply to these officers and it may be observed that those who have Chelsea  pensions as

soldiers

 soldiers may benefit  undei  Article 1 (i3) and those with children over 9 if pomi^sod of sr.,:.11 me ,ns may rot education ^llowuious under Artiole 8.    P;.,r;,, 5.  She degree of    offioerf3 disablement is tho do- tormining factor,  in o,..ch r,aik, in the r,..to of retired pay under Schedule 1  of tho IVarrnt.       Article 6 provides for nucoasary Ivludic il treatment, iii- stitutionul  or otherwise,  ..t tho public expense for off lours in  receipt  of disability retired pay*       llany  disabled officers uro being employed in Government offices,  t,nd it is the policy of tho Minister  of Jonsions to  recommend that  every possible preference should bo given to  dis-blod  officers in Government -aid private employment.       Through the  medium of tho Appointments Department of the  Ministry of labour a schema is&quot;at  work for assisting ox- officers, disabled as  well  as lit, to  find suitable employment,   Para,  6.  Under  the  .A,rrant already  referred to  several millions a year are being s sent on the i ens ions and :.fter-ce,re of dis- abled  officers  on  curefully considered lines,  and  this  pro- vis i an is far more beneficial and  helpful  than tho sotting a- sido  of  tho  capital sum proposed.       The i/arrant  is,  moreover,  supplemented by  the regulations of the  Special  Grants  Committee, which aim at  providing,  also from public  funds,  for oa,ses of hardship.       Projects  such as residcntal  clubs would,  it  is considered be more  suitably     dealt with by  unofficial organisations.   Para,  7*  The Minister of -Pension  shares  the  opinion  of the Oommander-irtrChlef in  Prance that  the  future welfare of our disabled  officers  should be&apos;dealt  with on  a  broad  and liberal basis;  but Sir  Douglas Kaig has  evidently  not  realised  what  is already  being cffoe tod under existing  powers,  and  may bo assured that no  officer whose  disability is  due  to  his  service  in thowar need  suffer privation or want,                        i                              1 am,                                   Sir,                                       Your  obedient.Servant,(Signed)  J..k*FLW.        Secretary&apos;
