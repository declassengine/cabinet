MEMORA^DCM  FOR  VAB  CABINET           With reference to the Memorandum circulated by the Chief Secretary for Ireland, Gr.T.6560,  I desire only to say that I am a little surprised  that this proposal has been communicated to the Cabinet without  first of all taking counsel with the Lord Lieutenant.           I have had an opportunity to discuss tho Memorandum with Hie Excellency who informs me that he, of course,  fully appreciates the gravity of the question and that he proposes immediately to disouss the v^hole situation, legal and political, with his advisers in Ireland to ascertain precisely what the faots are, and then make his recommendations.           I gather that there is some reason to believe that a proportion at all events of these prisoners if released at this moment would in all probability be an immediate cause of grave public danger, and I am therefore confident thai? the Cabinet will await the full report of the Lord Lieutenant  and the Irisii Government before coming to any conclusion.                                     W.H.L*                                       30.1E.18.ICE.
