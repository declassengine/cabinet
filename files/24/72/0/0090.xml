HThte DorColonel W. Dally Jones.ODSHtV  ofT. ^ HALL &amp;J^v      &quot;&quot;S e.c. R jSCOPY NO:110149/5286,The Secretary,     V/ar Cabinet,NORTH RUSSIA.     The War Cabinet decided on 31st  December that while no demobilization measures are  to be  taken  for the present,no further reinforcements to be ordered to  North  Russiauntil&apos;the question can be dealt with  in Paris,  I have wiredaccordingly to the Officers Commanding at Murmansk andArchangelo  The latter decision may entail  a withdrawal  fromhis present forward position by General Maynard,  and he  hasbeen warned to give early notice of such withdrawal.     In view of the proposed discussion at  Paris, I  forward the following short resume of the situation.     It became evident by the Autumn that our  original intention of joining hands with the Czechs  on  the Perm  -Vologda railway could not be realised,  About  the same  timeindications were observed of a German withdrawal  from finland and the menace of a German-Finn attack on the  Wurman railwaygradually became less, finally disappearing about the middleof October,     In  these circumstances it was decided that  nothing wasto be gained by pushing  the advance from Archangel,  but that,should it be decided to adopt a forward policy,  more effectivepressure could be brought to bear on the Bolshevik  government by an advance Southwards from Soroka,-  It was  therefore decided  that it&apos;was essential to hold the Wurman line to apoint South-west of the White Sea in order
        (i)  to open up $*%  secure coM:uuiicatioi:            with archangel  in  cc.sc  of  emergency            after the Port  \?as  frozen,  up.&apos;        (ii) to be prepared  for  forward action  if  such            should eventually bo de tended by Allied            policy.&apos;     Orders to the above effect were  sent to GeneralF0.y2-.ard, who proceeded uith his dispositions accordingly.Since the above it has beer, pointed out to  general &amp;ynard that a purely defensive policy is to be adopted.The nccossity for maintaining  communication withArchangel, however, still exists.     In addition, curadvance has laid upon us the responsibility of protect-irg such of the population  as  lie behind us.   It may beadded, that our forward position has been, and  is  a largeneasure of protection for Finland against Bolshevism.relieving that country of all anxiety  except for  itsSouth-eastern frontier.     The total nuriber of Allied and Local troops  under General liaynard &apos;s command, is as follows                              Rifle       RaTion       T    ______i__Strength.

The above distribution is  necessitated,  not  only  to  hold the front against any possible  Bolshevik attack,  but alsoto protect the line itself from sabotage.     In view of the miserable condition of the iviirman Rail-way, the great length (about 350 miles)  to be guarded and  thedisaffection of part of the population,  the security of theLines oi Communication between Kandalaksha and Kern causesgreat anxiety.  Great hardship, and not improbably disaster,to our troops may result if the necessary personnel forr a I lwayma intenanc e^ i s not sen t jto General iviaynard at anearly date;.     The  severe nature of the climate is well known to theWar Cabinet,  During the next few months temperatures ofmany degrees below zero, with frequent  snow blizzards, haveto be faced.  During the three v/inter months there is little  light during the whole 24 hours,  Foreseeing theseconditions the war Office have made such provision as hasbeen possible in  the time available for the health andcomfort  of the troops.  Clothing, food  and  comforts havebeen provided on  a satisfactory scale,  and  there  is noanxiety  on this score.  The  matter of housing, Includinglighting, however, is  a source of great concern,  and  GeneralMaynard has pressed  for the  despatch of certain  Engineerpersonnel which he considers essential.  If  it is decidedto maintain our present positions in the Murmansk area,it  is essential that the Railway and R.E*  personnel mentionedabove should be despatched without delay,   The total numbers involved are about 1,000.     On  the other hand any withdrawal from  our presentpositions will expose  considerable numbers  of the Russianpopulation, who have supported the Allied force,  tomassacre by the Soviet troops.
     Although the despatch of drafts to Forth Russia nayprove very unpopular, and nc.y even lead to insubordinationend other serious trouble, it roust be realised that theonly alternative nay bo a vritb&amp;raual at least to  )(hhdalaksha     (2)  ARQliANGhL.      General Ironsido lias boon informed that he  is toadopt c. purely defensive attitude, con.tir.uing tho trainingof the Russian troops in the area no,/ occupied.

Good  progress  is being made with the  trainingof the Russians *  With these latter  General  Ironside hasalso had a  little difficulty, but his  firm action,  it  ishoped, will prevent a recurrence  of  any  insubordination.General  Ironside  has  sent  demands for  reinforcements,both for infantry and for  technical  personnel.
It has been impossible to meet these demands largely owing to the fact that eommunication,  save withicebreakers, is now impossible.   General Ironside,however, appears confident of being able to maintainhis position, and it Is doubtful whether, in view oftheir anxieties in other directions, the bolshevikswill be able to stage any serious attack againstArchangel before the opening of that port.     The climate is milder than that of Murmansk.Although General Ironside will probably be faced with considerable difficulties owing to our inability tosupply him with all his requirements in technical personnel, the situation as regards housing and therailway is not so acute as that at ivlurmansk,3,   To sum up, I would earnestly dra\; the attention ofthe War Cabinet to the present unsatisfactory situation of our forces in North Eussia, and  to the urgent necessity of coming to a decision on the policy to beadopted without delay.  Unless it is decided towithdraw forthwith to Kandalaksha,  it Is  essentialthat the railway personnel and other details requiredby General Maynard should be despatched forthwith;and every day!s delay adds to  the risk which is alreadyserious.
