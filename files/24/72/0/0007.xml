NOTES  OA  MAP  2.     1. Turco-Bulgarian Frontier. This  question is being dealt with in the series of memoranda on the British case in relation  to Southern and South-Eastern Europe.  The line shown on this map is  that of the Turco-Bulgarian Treaty  of 1915, and has the merit of leaving  the Dedeagatch Railway  to Bulgaria and the tombs of the Sultans in Adrianople to Turkey.  Any other  line must  deprive  either  Turkey of Adrianople or Bulgaria of access to the  /aegean.     2. Frontiers of Armenia.-The suggested western frontier follows the naturalline&apos; of the Taurus Range, and is identical with  the boundary between the blue and green areas in the agreements (Nos. 11 and  12) up to a point north of Sivas.  From there it is carried northwards to Cape Yasun  on the Black Sea, leaving Turkey in  possession of Samsun, which is the natural port  for North and North-Central Anatolia.   Trebizond and Kerasond, having a mixed Greek, Turkish and Armenian population, should  be assigned to Armenia, since they are the outlet  for a great part of the Armenian interior towards the Black Sea.   There is also an  ancient  trade route from  Trebizond across Armenia to North-West Persia.  This route will certainly regain its  importance, and it would be equitable to make Trebizond a free port, and to  secure free transit across the Armenian hinterland for trade with Persia.     The area marked C is the Karabagli district, and there is a large Armenian popu- lation in the mountains, which preserved its liberty against Persia in the pre-Russian period, and has held out against the Turkish invader during the  last few months.  On historical grounds it should go to Armenia,  but  there is also  a strong  Azerbaijani element in the population, and  the best permanent  settlement might be to bring about a segregation of the Armenians and Azerbaijanis into separate areas by persuading the Karabagh Armenians to emigrate to the Erivan district and the Erivan Azerbaijanis to Karabagh.  If this were done, Area C would of course fall to Azerbaijan.     The area marked F and coloured green has a mixed Armenian, Kurdish, and Arab population, and should  probably be divided between  the Armenian and Arab States when  the exact  local conditions  have been ascertained  by investigation.  If it were feasible to carry a railway  from  Alexandretta north-eastwards through  Aintab, Urfa, and Diarbekir, it might be desirable to keep all these  places on the Armenian side of the frontier, but  such  a  railway might be impracticable.  In any case, the track  of future railways ought to be  taken into consideration in settling the frontier here.     From the Euphrates to the Mediterranean the suggested frontier practically follows the  northern  line of Arabic speech, taking in the Armenian villages of Jebel Musa, the inhabitants of which were rescued in 1915 by the Allied fleets, and have since then been refugees in  Egypt.     3. Frontiers of Georgia. The  area marked  D and  coloured  green  is territory formerly belonging  to  Turkey which is  inhabited by Lazes, that is, tribes which are Georgian in language but Moslem in religion.     East of D  the line  assigns  to Georgia the Akhaltzikh and Akhalkalaki  districts, which are inhabited chiefly by  Armenians,  descended  from refugees  who crossed the Russian frontier  from  Turkey at various periods  during the  last century.  On grounds of nationality, therefore, these districts ought  to  belong to Armenia, but they command the heart of Georgia strategically, and on the whole it would seem equitable to assign them to Georgia, and  give their Armenian inhabitants the option of emigra- tion into the wide territories assigned  to the Armenians towards the south-west.     The area marked A is inhabited by Abkhazians, an indigenous Moslem, tribe who are not Georgians in language.  The Georgians have been attempting to annex Area A during the last few months,  and it is reported that the Abkhazians have been resistingthem by force of arms.  This area should not be forced to unite with Georgia against it will, and should either be left as part of Russia or kept separate and given foreignassistance as an independent unit.    The two areas marked B  are  doubtful as between Georgia and  the tribes ofDaghestan.   As   between  Georgia  and  Azerbaijan,  there  are  no  difficulties  of demarcation.    4. The  area  marked E  and coloured  green belongs  to  the Nestorian (Assyrian)Christians, who speak  a  Semitic  dialect, and are distinct  in  every way from the surrounding Kurds.  The Nestorians  have been badly treated during the war by the      [920-1 A]
 Kurds at the instigation of  the Turkish authorities.  They should be formed into an autonomous principality on  the same lines as the Lebanon, and there should be  the same assisting Power as in Southern Kurdistan.     5.  The Lebanon. The  area marked G and  coloured  green covers  the  Lebanon vilayet  within the boundaries defined in 1861, with the addition of the Beirut enclave.     6.  Frontiers of Palestine. It is assumed that the Jordan and the Dead  Sea will form the frontier on the east.  The suggested frontier on the north is the River Litany. This would give Sur (Tyre)  to Palestine and  said a (Sidon) to  the  Lebanon.  said a is wrongly marked on the map south of the River Litany, where Sur ought to be.     Towards  the south it is  difficult to draw a precise line between settled and Bedouin country, but it would be a sound principle to  include all country capable of cultivation (e.g., in the direction of Rafa and Beershebaj in the settled area.     The  Bedouin  area here  is  marked  H and coloured  green,  and this should probably be attached to Egypt, since the tribes are identical with  those  in the  Sinai Peninsula, and the pre-war frontier is quite arbitrary from the tribal point of view.     Akaba should be left to the Arabs, but it might  be advisable to  include some of the wells on the  east side of  the Bay in Egyptian territory, so that we might be able tomake a  British harbour here if it proved desirable to  do so hereafter.                               NOTES  ON MAP 3.      1.  Natural Areas. In considering the internal boundaries of the Arab area, it is important to realise at the outset that the &quot; desert &quot; cannot be carved up arbitrarily on American or Australian lines.   The Arabian Desert, and above  all the Syrian part of it, is not a no-man&apos;s land.   Every foot of it is private property.   Wells, grazing rights, rights of transit, &amp;c, are jealously defined  and maintained.  And the apportionment of them between the tribes is not a matter of caprice but of economic necessity, just as much as the  apportionment  of mines, harbours, &amp;c, jn settled  countries.   The tribal areas have been  worked  out by the experience of thousands  of  years, and  are so arranged as to support the maximum  population  in  a country where, on  account of physical characteristics, the nomadic life will always remain the most economic method of exploitation.  Any arrangement of boundaries must  therefore  &quot;be based on  the permanent underlying areas.   It must consist simply in grouping them in one way or another, and  if it is to work it must never ignore them or partition them.     At  the same time Bedouin tribal boundaries  are of course more elastic than the frontiers of settled countries, and the lines marked on the map are only approximate.     2. The  &quot;Blue&quot;  or &quot;Feisal&quot;  Group-This  includes  the  settled  towns  and cultivated districts of Syria (blue wash)  and the tribal areas  economically  dependent on them (blue outline).     3. The &quot;Red&quot; or &quot; Abdullah &quot; Group. This includes the settled districts of Irak and the  tribal  areas  economically  dependent on  them.   In  Irak  there are also semi-settled tribes inside the settled area, for example, the tribes of the  Shatt-al-Hai and the Muntefik.  These will  have  to  be absorbed  into  the settled population, and cannot be dealt  with on lines of tribal autonomy.     4. The &quot; Yellow &quot; or &quot; Husein &quot; Group. This includes the tribal areas and oases which are likely  to be dependent on Mecca, especially the principality of Jebel  Shammar, the ruler of which, bin ftashid, has lately sent in his submission to King Husein.     5. The &quot;Jezireh&quot; or &quot; Zaid&quot; Area. This  country  is at  present in  transition from nomadism  to settlement.   There are cultivated patches round Harran, Ras-ul-Ain, Mardin, Sinjar, and Mosul; purely nomadic Arab  tribes, like the Northern Shammar; and other tribes, principally Kurds, which are in process of settling down.     6. Kurdistan-This country is purely tribal in  the mountains and  settled in the lowlands towards  the south-west.   The Kerkuk district has a great  industrial future on account of  its oil-fields, and certainly cannot be treated tribally. &apos;     7. Koweit. The area shown on the map is that assigned to  the Sheikh of Koweit, as the outer limit of. his tribal  suzerainty under the Anglo-Turkish Convention of the 29th  July, 1913.   The,  Turkish military posts of  Safwan and  Umm Kasr on the mainland, just north of Bubian Island, ought now  to be included in his dominions.
