                 MEMORANDUM TO Mi  CABINET.          Much apprehension is  felt  in the Colonies, particul.ai\ly in the Eastern Colonies,  as to the  possible  consequences of the return of the enemy subjects who have been interned during the war,  and  of  thou resumption cf their place  in the normal life of the oormaiity, or  indeed of the  admission of other m%&amp;/ subjects  to  take their placet.   I have received strong represent tations on the  subject from Hongkong and the Straits , and the High  Commissioner for the Western Paciiio has telegraphed to me his fear;?  of  the detrimental moral effect on the native tribes of. the return of tho Germans.   The Governor of Hongkong tele- graphs that ^public opinion here is strongly opposed to any German being  allowed to enter  the Colony of Hongkong at present&quot;; and the China Association have forwarded to me a resolution passed at  a mass meeting; in Hongkong that &quot;no German subject should he  allowed to reside in this Colony or trade here for a period of years11.   In a subsequent telegram the Governor warns me of the  consequences of the interned Germans attempting to                                                        4 &quot;land in the  face of bitter public opposition&quot;.    The  Governor of Jamaica has also telegraphed recommending legislation.         The Governor of the Straits teloyaphs  to me  that theFederal  Council (which includes the  Malay rajahs and unofficialrepresentatives of the European community)haa resolved that &quot;noGerman bo permitted to enter, reside or  trade within theFederated Malay States for a period of years  and thereafter under licence&quot;.   All the  rajahs spoke in favour of this resolution and it wag supported by all the Planters Associations,  chambers of Oormerce and similar bodies,   The  Governor is &quot;sure thatthere  is  every possibility of regrettable incidents if theGermans  are allowed to return&quot;  .   This is hardly to be  wonderedat, seeing the part  the employes of  the  German firm of  BehnMeyer  and Company have played in encouraging Indian sedition,  and                                                       the
  the suspicions felt as to German complicity in the  outbreak of  the Malay States Guides.   He particularly names  certain Germans  whose influence on the natives would be  bad.   The  Legislative  Council of Ceylon has also passed a unanimous  resolution against  allowing any German or Austrian to reside  in the  Colony  till  some years have elapsed;  and the Chamber  of Commerce has passed  a similar resolution.           It will be realized that Colonial conditions make  it  very desirable, and indeed necessary,  to adopt a  firm policy in  this matter.   In many Colonies we have  a  large native population.  The European is often a planter in command cf  a large labour force  and living in isolated spots where he  cannot be effectively watched  or controlled,   jlgain as a missionary or  a trader  he is  brought  into close contact with natives,  his intercourse  with them cannot  be supervised, and his opportunities for making mischief  are  endless.   I am therefore in favour of adopting a policy  of  exclusion of Germans from the Colonies and protectorates  for a  period of (say) five years on four grounds:-      (1) the very real danger of their fomenting disloyalty  in  such communities as Ceylon,  where the feeling  over  the riots has -not yet subsided,  and in general in ail  communities where there,  is a largo preponderance of natkes or black men;      (2) the danger to the Germans themselves,  whom  we may be  unable to protect from outrages,  which will give  our Colonies  a  bad name;      (3) the importance of restoring our  oversea trade without  being hampered by the unfair competition of our late enemies.  This is particularly important in Hongkong, which has so  large a  share in the China trade, and in Singapore, which is a depot for  all the East.
    (4) the disastrous effect on the native mind of the trium-phant return of the German ?honi he has seen igaominiously removed,         I propose that all the Colonies and Protectorates shouldbe invited to legislate without, delay prohibiting Germans fromanterihg,  residing or trading locally in their territory for  aperiod of five years from the end of the war.   And to close  allloop-holes and to provide against the possibility of the aboveevil consequences following the return of ill-disposed subjects of other enemy states,.I propose to ask that the legislation  inquestion shall give the Governor power to exclude individuallysubjects of other enemy states without excluding them as a class.         Provision will of course be made to meet the case ofany Poles, Alsatians etc, who may still remain German subjectsafter the  war.
