The lifting of potatoes is now practically completed. In districts the mild weather has caused considerable  sprouting of

?/18


potatoes in pits. About three-fourths of the turnip crop has been pulled and stored. The yield generally ? below average. inter pastures have still a good bottom of grass, and outlying cattle are in excellent condition. Fodder is being used sparingly.

FLAX.

Scutching Results. The yields of scutched flax in the flax mills are now considerably higher than those obtained earlier in the season, but are still under average.

Labour Disputes. The scutchers in counties Mayo and Wicklow, who were on strike, have resumed work. There have been no further developments in connection with the threat of members of the Ulster Flax Scutchers&apos; Union to go out on strike.

Flaxseed Tests.

Better results have been obtained from Yorkshire. Dutch and Russian ? than from Canadian and Japanese. As between canadian and Japanese, the former of these two seeds has proved the more satisfactory. The opinions of ? numerous flax mill owners which have been ascertained, confirm the results of the Department&apos;s field trials.
