We  shall be muoh obligod if Lord Gave oan ascertain for us what oourse the government propose to adopt in oonnootion with Press  reports of, and comments bout, the proceedings of the Poaoe Conference,  We  have already made arrango- mts to reduce the staff of censors here in consequence of tho cessation of ostilities, and further reductions could be arranged if it is intended that reports  of the proceedings of tho Peace Conference  should bo exempt from any orm of  censorship,     A  simplo and possibly satisfactory method vdth  regard to reports of tho enference weuld be for the Secretaries to issue m official statement once or rrice daily for the whole Press, but we are told unofficially that ilr, Wilson s against any restriction whatever upon newspaper  reports, whilst we are imilarly infarmed that the Fronoh Government desires to put considerable estriotions upon the French Pross,   With so many  delegates and so many different lationalities assembled in Paris, it seems advisable  to  settle some clear method f procedure before the Conference opens.    Of oourse, the simplest method so ar as the Press is concerned would be to leave every correspondent free to send, id every newspaper free to publish, whatever they choose,  but it is possible that his might lead to  great difficulties,                                         F.A.8.                                         2.T.C.
