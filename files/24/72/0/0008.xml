;-[This Document is the proper-ty of His  Britannic Majestys  Government.]                                                                                     33CONFIDENTIAL.12.P. 24.THE  FAR EAST AND NON-AFRICAN  COLONIES.       IN this memorandum  I have attempted to indicate the  principal  changes which  the war has effected in the status quo ante in the  Far East, and to mention briefly the  questions arising out of  ihese territorial,  political, and economic changes which will  probably come up for discussion at the Peace Congress.  I have recapitulated the various  commitments of His Majesty&apos;s Government towards their Allies or co-belligerents in  respect to these questions, and  I  have ventured  to add  some conclusions as to the  policy which it would appear desirable to pursue in each case.       It is perhaps desirable that I should preface this statement by drawing attention  to a factor which will influence the  solution of all the questions relating to  the Far  East which may arise at the Peace Congress.  I refer to the standpoint from which the  United States will approach these questions, and especially  that of the future relations  of China with the outside world.   One of the indirect effects of the war on the situation  in the  Far East has been the opportunity afforded to Japan to pursue an  ambitious and  self-seeking  policy  in China  owing to the  preoccupations  of  the Great  Powers  elsewhere, the  displacement  of the  balance of power  in the  Pacific, and the sudden &apos; increase of her national wealth due to the wave of prosperity which the war brought  to  her trade,  her shipping, and her industries.   In May 1915 Japan extorted from China  compliance with a series  of demands by which she secured the reversion of German  rights in Shantung, the recognition of her special position  and interests in Manchuria  and Eastern  Inner Mongolia, the extension of the terms of the lease of Port Arthur and  Dalny and of the lease of  the  South Manchurian  Railway  and the Antung-Mtikden  Railway to 99 years, the consolidation of her control over the Hanyehping iron  mines,  and a declaration that China would not permit foreign nations to construct dockyards,  coaling stations, naval bases, &amp;c, on the coast  of  Fukien.   Subsequently profiting by  the existence of a military party in the Government  at  Peking who were prepared to  pledge every  conceivable asset in China to raise funds for the prosecution of the civil war against the South, the Japanese have succeeded in consolidating their hold on Manchuria, Inner   Mongolia, and  Shantung  by  concluding  a  series  of  political,  economic, and industrial loans to China amounting to a total of some 36,000,0001. in two years, and in connection with  these loan  agreements have  secured  the  appointment. of  Japanese financial, military, banking, and other experts.   This aggressive policy and the exclusive and selfish  spirit which the Japanese  have  shown towards  all foreign  competition in their spheres  of interest are  diametrically opposed to  the altruistic attitude of America in  her relations with China.   The United States Government have frequently declared that their policy was based  on the preservation of  Chinas  territorial  integrity,  the maintenance of her independence and sovereign  rights, and the principles of the open door and equal commercial opportunity,  but  hitherto they  have shown  reluctance to associate themselves with the other Powers in attempting either to guide the course of internal events or to provide China with the  means to put her house in order.  Now there are abundant indications that the United States Government are resolved to play a far more active part in China in the future, and that the American delegates  at  the Peace Congress, in pursuance  of the aims and ideals  formulated in President  Wilson&apos;s peace terms, will  advocate the creation of a league  of peace under  Anglo-American auspices, which will control militarism in the Far East, and secure that the resources of China are developed for the  common  benefit,  and not for  the aggrandisement of any particular  nation.  Carried  to  its  logical  conclusion,  such  a  policy implies  the renunciation  of  spheres  of interest  and  leased   territories,  and  the  sharing or internationalisation of  all financial  concessions and industrial enterprises in China of sufficient magnitude  to involve a public issue.  The United  States will doubtless expect  His Majesty&apos;s Government to  endorse  this  policy  and to co-operate  in  its realisation, and it will be seen that, however desirable it may be for the future welfare of our interests in the Far  East that we should whole-heartedly adopt  such a policy in close harmony with America,  there will be considerable difficulty  in  reconciling this attitude  with  the pledges of  support  which we have given to Japan in respect to her claims to succeed  to certain German assets in  Shantung and  elsewhere, and  with theprivileged position in respect  to railway construction  and other enterprises which  wehave hitherto claimed for our nationals in the Yang-tsze Valley.       [999]                                    &quot;                          B
                                Territorial Changes.     These consist, so  far  as  the Far East  is concerned, in (1) the  occupation ot the German possessions and islands  in the Pacific by the British Colonial  forces and  by Japanese  forces, and (2) the occupation of Kiaochow Bay and the fortress and town of Tsingtao,  the Tsingtao-tsinan-fu-fu railway, and other  German rights in the province of Shantung by the Japanese.                             -  1. The Pacific Islands.     A very short statement  of the history of events is  necessary to appreciate the actual position.     In the early days of the war His Majesty&apos;s Government attempted, unsuccessfully, to circumscribe Japanese aims and activities in  the Pacific.  Japan, however, declined to give any assurances as to the geographical limits of her action, and, in the course of naval operations, carried out in  co-operation with her ally for the purpose of destroying the enemy naval bases and ships  in the  Pacific,  Japanese forces proceeded to occupy the Marshall Islands and the Caroline, Marianne, and Pellew groups.  In the meantime the Australian authorities  had received the surrender of the German Governor of  New Guinea, including  all these German possessions with  the exception of Samoa.   The Japanese Government, however, claimed that the actual surrender of those north of the Equator had been obtained by Japanese naval forces, and they made it clear that  they had no intention of evacuating these islands   To avoid, further discussion the Govern- ment of Australia refrained  from sending an expedition north of the Equator, which was tacitly adopted as a, provisional line  of demarcation,  Australian forces  occupying German New  Guinea, Kieta,  Bougainville, Nauru, and  Rabaul and a new Zealand expeditionary force the German Samoan Islands, while all the German islands north of the Equator remained in the occupation of the Japanese.  His Majesty&apos;s Government declined to commit  themselves  to  a  promise to  support the Japanese  claim  for the retention of the islands north of the Equator, and  maintained  that  all occupations  of territory must be provisional till the end of the war, i.e., held over for discussion in the final Peace Conference.     This was the position till early in 1917, when His Majesty&apos;s Government, owing to the necessity of obtaining further naval assistance  from Japan in  the  Mediterranean and South  Atlantic, were compelled to modify their  attitude, and finally, after obtaining the acquiescence of the Governments of Australia and New Zealand, gave the Japanese Government  an assurance that they would  support  Japan&apos;s  claims  in  regard to the disposal of Germany&apos;s  rights in Shantung and possessions in the islands north of the Equator, on the occasion of the Peace Conference, it being understood that the Japanese Government  would, in  the eventual peace  settlement, treat  in  the  same  spirit Great Britains claims to the  German islands south of the Equator.     The Allied  Powers, signatories  of the Pact  of London, and  subsequently  the United States Government, who had displayed interest in the matter, were informed ofthis assurance.                                   Conclusions.     The attitude of the Japanese  Government and of public opinion in  Japan, as expressed in  their  newspapers,  demonstrate beyond  any possible  doubt that every endeavour  will be made by  the Japanese delegates at the Peace Congress to  secure the retention of the German islands  north of the Equator.     Similarly the attitude  of public opinion in Australia and New Zealand, and theutterances  of their leading statesmen, notably the  Prime Minister  of Australia,  have made&apos; it clear that the national existence and security of the peoples  of the   Common-wealth of  Australia, and of the Dominion of New Zealand, depend upon  the  retention, either in their own hands or in the hands of Great Britain, of the islands in the Pacificwhich formerly belonged to Germany.  Leaving aside any  claim which  Germany  may put forward at the Peace Conference for the return of her lost colonies, the only possible objection which may be raised to the retention  of the German  islands north of the Equator by Japan, and of those south of that line by Great  Britain or by the Dominions of Australia  and New Zealand,  will  come from the United  States Government, which not only on general principles, but also for  individual reasons, may  not  be disposed to welcome the extension of Japanese  influence in the Pacific.  America is not likely to object to the  transfer of the German possessions in the Pacific to Great Britain. Should,however, such objection be  urged by the  United  States delegates at the Congress,  it
  would appear desirable for His Majesty&apos;s Government to support the Japanese  claim in  -order to secure for themselves the support which the Japanese Government are  pledged  to give in virtue of the assurances exchanged between the two Governments.        2.  Occupation of the Leased Territory of Kiaocliow, &amp;c., by the  Japanese       The reduction of the fortress of Tsingtao was effected by a  Japanese  military and  naval expedition,  in  whi &apos;h  a small  British  force  and some  British  men-of-war  participated.       In the ultimatum delivered by Japan to, Germany,  the  German Government were  required to deliver on a date not later than the  15th September, 1914, to the Imperial  Japanese authorities, without condition or compensation, the entire leased territory of  Kiaochow, with a view  to eventunl restoration  of the same to  China.   Moreoter, His  Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Tokyo was told  by Baron Kato, then Minister for Foreign  Affairs, on the 10th  August,  1914, that the Japanese  were preparing an  attack  on  Tsingtao, that they desired no territorial aggrandisement in  that region,  but that  they would be in a position eventual illy to restore to China the territory from which the  German occupation had excluded her.  Nevertheless the Japanese Government  refused  to join Mis  Majesty&apos;s Government in  a  declaration  to  the  Chinese Government that  Kiaochow would be returned, and eventually an official statement was made in the  Japanese Parliament  that the whole  position had been altered by the fact that Japan  had been obliged to capture the place by force of arms  and that the Japanese Govern-  ment had entered into no agreement wdth any American or European country, or  with  China, as a result of which Japan was compelled to restore Kiaochow to China.      The question  remained in doubt until  May 1915, when Japan made a  series of  demands on China, and those relating to the  future  status of Shantung were embodied  in treaties  and exchanges of notes.   By  a treaty concluded  on the 25th May, 1915,  the  Chinese  Government agreed to give full assent to all matters upon  which the  Japanese Government might hereafter agree with the German Government relating  to  the disposition  of  all  rights, interests, and  concessions  which  Germany, by  virtue of  treaties or otherwise, possessed in relation to the province of Shantung.      By an exchange of notes signed  the same day, the  Japanese Government declared  that &quot;when after  the termination of the present war the leased territory of Kiaochow  Bay is completely left  to the free disposal of Japan, the Japanese Government will restore the said leased territory to  China under the following conditions:           &quot; (1.)  The whole of Kiachow Bay to be opened as a commercial port.          &quot; (2.)  A concession, under the exclusive jurisdiction of Japan, to be established      at a place designated by the Japanese Government.          &quot; (3.)  If  the foreign  Powers desire it,  an international concession may be      established.          &quot; (4.)  The Japanese  and  Chinese  Governments  shall arrange  by  mutual      agreement the disposal of the German properties and buildings.&quot;      The Chinese Government took note of this declaration and made no protest.      By the. assurance  given in  February 1917,  in connection with the German  islands in the Pacific, and in  the circumstances already described,  His Majesty&apos;s Government agreed to  support Japan&apos;s claims  in regard  to the disposal of Germanj^s rights in-Shantung on the occasion of the Peace Conference.                                    Conclusions.     It is  to be anticipated that China, if  represented  at the Peace Conference,  will endeavour to enlist the support  of the Powers, and especially of the  United States, in obtaining the retrocession of the leased  territory of Kiaochow Bay.     It may  be argued  that His Majesty&apos;s  Government are under a  certain moral obligation towards China  to see that Kiaochow is  restored to her, as  His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Peking  informed  the Chinese  Government, on instructions, founded on Baron Kato&apos;s original  statement to Sir C. Greene, that  the Chinese Government need have no apprehension as to the  result of any joint action by the British and Japanese Governments,  and  because  the President of  the  Chinese Republic was no  doubt influenced by the prospect of the eventual restoration to China of Kiaochow when hesanctioned  the  technical breach of China&apos;s neutrality  involved  in  the  landing of  a
Japanese expeditionary force outside the  limits of that leased territory.  On the otherhand,  in  view  of  the fact  that  China  made  no protest  against the arrangementsubsequently forced upon her by Japan, His Majesty&apos;s  Government may perhaps betaken  to  be  released from such  obligation, more especially  as  no written guaranteeor assurances were ever given to China on the subject.     As regards  the Japanese claims to the reversion  of Germanys  rights in Shantungwe are bound by our pledge to support them, but  we should be careful, I think, to limitour support strictly to the reversion to Japan only of the definite  and specific rights and concessions legitimately  acquired by Germany in the province  and recognised by theChinese Government,  and we are under no obligation to  support any extension of such rights and privileges, e.g., Japanese claims to introduce and maintain civil  administra-tion in the railway areas,  &amp;c.                      The Leased Territory of Wei-hai  Wei.    It is obvious that the value to His Majesty&apos;s Government of this  leased territory,which comprises the island of Liu Kung, and all the islands in the Bay of Wei-hai Weiand a  belt of  land  10  English miles wide along the  entire coast-line of the Bay ofWei-hai Wei,  will  be modifh d to a very serious extent if, as  a result of the war, theJapanese retain  possession of the leased territory of Kiaochow and the German rights in the province of  IShantung.    The lease of Wei-hai Wei was  originally  secured  from  China  by His  Majesty&apos;sGovernment by  the convention of July  1,  1898,  as  a  counterpoise to  the Russianoccupation of Port Arthur, and was to last  for so long as that  place  remained in russian occupation.  For various reasons we have never attempted seriously to develop the territory,  nor  have  we  erected any fortresses on  the  mainland or the  islands.Moreover, as it  has so far not been  connected with  the existing railways in Shantungprovince, the volume and value of its trade  has remained insignificant. It has, however,served a useful purpose as a summer station for our vessels of war in the China St as andas a sanatorium..  In  view of the fact that  the object for which  the  territory  was originally acquired had ceased to exist, and having regard to the very small value,  ifany, which, in view of the Japanese occupation of Kiaochow and the Liaotung Peninsula,the place now possesses as a naval or military base in the event of hostilities with that power, the question is under consideration whether we should  not evacuate the territory and restore it to the Chinese.    From  the political point  of  view it  may, I think, betaken for granted that the Chinese would prefer to see us remain in Wei-hai Wei as  acounterpoise to Japanese influence in Kiaochow and Shantung and that we should suffersome loss of prestige if, in the circumstances, we were now to  evacuate either the islandsor the leased territory or  both.  Although our remaining  in Wei-hai  Wei could not bea serious  menace to their position  in  Kiaochow,  the  Japanese  would undoubtedlywelcome our departure, and therefore, subject  to the views of the  Admiralty and theColonial Office, I venture to suggest that,  if the  decision is reached to give  up theterritory, the opportunity should be taken to make a bargain with Japan which might take the form of securing from her certain guarantees as  regards the treatment ofBritish trade interests in  the port of  Chefoo and in the province of Shantung generally..   Effect of the War on the Status of Enemy Subjects  in China, on their Property.                          Extra-territorial Privileges, etc.    Of the four  belligerent enemy States Germany and Austria-Hungary alone were intreaty relations with China.     On China&apos;s  declaration of war on the Central Powers on the  14th August, 1917,the Chinese Government  addressed an official  note  to  the Dutch  Minister,  who hadbeen charged with German interests, informing him  that in  consequence  of the  stateof war existing  between China and  Germany the  treaty of the Mnd September,  1861(the Treaty of Friendship, Commerce, and Navigation under which  Germany obtainedher extra-territorial privdeges in  China), the  Supplementary Convention  of  the31st March,  1880, and all other treaties,  conventions,  and agreements of whatevernature at present in force between  China and Germany were abrogated, as also all such provisions of the Protocol of the 7th September, 1901, and  other similar international agreements as only concerned China and Germany.    A similar note was addressed to the Austro-Hungarian Minister.    The abrogation of the treaties which conler extra-territorial privileges on German.
  and Austro-Hungarian subjects in China raises a variety  of special questions which I  will merely enumerate as briefly as possible.       1. Enemy Residential Concessions in China. These are demarcated areas in certain  treaty ports, viz., at Tien-tsin, tsinan-fu-fu, and Hankow, in the case of Germany, and at  Tien-tsin only in the case  of Austria-Hungary, which  have been  ceded by China in  perpetuity to the Governments of Germany or Austria-Hungary at a nominal rent as  places of residence for their subjects.  The concessions are  administered  by municipali-  ties elected  by the landowners and renters, and all  persons, whether foreigners or  natives, residing in or visiting the concession,  are  subject  to the regulations  and bye-  laws   of  the  municipality.   China  maintains  only  her sovereign  rights over  the  concessions.  Since their declaration of war the Chinese  Government have nominally  occupied these German and Austro-Hungariau residential concessions, but have allowed  the several municipal administrations to  continue  to function.  Similarly, the German  and Austro-Hungarian residents in the International Settlement at Shanghai have lost  their franchise  qualifications  and  right  to participate in the administration  of the  Settlement.      2.  Enemy Public Property in China. -Besides the question of the future status of  German and Austro-Hungarian consular buildings, banks, and post offices in the various  treaty ports, the abrogation of the rights secured to Germany and Austria-Hungary  under the 1901 Boxer Settlement Protocol involves the question of the future status of  the Legation buildings, banks, barracks in the diplomatic quarter at Peking, as well as  the right to maintain a Legation guard, &amp;c.     3.  Enemy Private Property. In respect of such property the Chinese Government have agreed to adopt the policy recommended at the Enemy Property Conference at Paris, and have enacted legislation based on the French model for the sequestration  of enemy property and businesses, though so far the contemplated measures do not appear to have been enforced in a satisfactory or  adequate manner, and  very little, if anything, has been effected.     His Majesty&apos;s Government, through Trading with the Enemy Regulations in China, have provided for the vesting in the custodian of  enemy property in China, the  leases of German public buildings and other leasehold property situated in the British  Con- cessions of the Shameen (Canton), Tien-tsin, and Hankow, and similarly for the vesting of other forms of enemy property in British hands.     4. Enemy Concessions for Railways,  Mines, and other Forms of Industrial Enter&quot; prise in China. These include :     (a) Concessions for railways to be constructed  by a German group for the Chinese            Government under  loan agreements with the  Chinese Government, in part-            nership with other  foreign groups, as in the case of  the German section of            the Hukuang Railways.     (6)  Railways built  by the  German Government and controlled and managed  by           their nationals, such as the tsinan-fu-fu-Tsingtao Railway.     (c)  The northern  section  of the Tien-tsin-Pukow  Railway,  which is a Chinese           Government. Railway built under  an  Anglo-German loan agreement, the           northern section being  built  and managed  by a German  group and  the           southern section by a British group.     As  regards (a) the Chinese  Government have practically liquidated the  German interests under the Hukuang Railway Agreement; (b)  is now controlled  by  the Japanese, and is claimed by them as  one of Germany&apos;s  rights  and  concessions in  the province of, Shangtung;  (c)  the  Japanese Government  have not yet preferred a definite claim to the northern section of this railway, although  it  passes through the province of Shantung, but they have intimated  to us that if such a claim were to take definite  shape they rely on the support of His Majesty&apos;s Government in virtue, of an assurance given by  Lord Grey of Fallodon  to the Japanese Ambassador.     The other enemy-owned railway, mineral, and industrial  enterprises  in China  fall within the category of enemy private property, and call for  no special comment.     5. Enemy  participation in the  International Bankers Consortium in China. A German  group, represented in China by the Deutsche-Asiastiche Bank, formed part of the original Quadruple Agreement  for a currency reform and industrial development loan of April 1911,  which never materialised, and subsequently participated in  the issue of the Reorganisation Loan  of 25,000,000L, in  April  1913, by the quintuplegroup.      -[999]                                                              C
      As a result of China&apos;s entry into the war Germany has forfeited her position in the  consortium and her rights under the above-nentioned loan  agreements, including the  German group&apos;s share in an option on a  currency reform loan when issued.      6. German and Austro-Hungarian Loans to  China. The payment of the interest  on these loans, as  well as on the Boxer Indemnity, has been suspended.                                     Conclusions.      Germany and Austria-Hungary will naturally endeavour, on  the conclusion  of  peace, to  re-establish diplomatic and friendly relations with  China and to renew the  treaties which secure to their  nationals the  extra-territorial  privileges, most-favoured-  nation treatment,  and other rights and advantages enjoyed  by them  before the war.  The Chinese  Government presumably  will be ready to restore those  relations at the  earliest possible moment, unless the Allied  Governments consider it  desirable to use  their influence to induce them to delay  the conclusion of the new7 treaties or to modify  their scope in the sense of cancelling or restricting  the  extra-territorial and other  prhileges conferred by the previous conventions.   The question arises whether  British  interests in China would  be  secured  or  advanced  by the  restriction of the extra-  territorial  privileges  and  other rights hitherto  enjoyed  by  Germans and  Austro-  Hungarians in China  in common with the nationals of the other treaty Powers.      Our policy in  this matter should, I think, be guided by the consideration that there  is a growing demand in China, and especially among the more politically advanced and  foreign-educated elements known as &quot; Young China,&quot; for  the abolition of all extra-  territorial privileges, and that, in view of the fact that the internal conditions of China,  the insecurity, the official corruption,  and the inadequacy of her judicial administration  would make the position of the foreign  communities untenable without the safeguards  of  extra-territoriality, it would create  a very dangerous  precedent to encourage the  Chinese Government to withhold, or even to restrict, these special rights and privileges  in the case of  Germans and Austro-Hungarians.  All the foreign communities in China are equally interested in  maintaining these extra-territorial privileges,  and hitherto  it  has been the solidarity of those interests, as represented at Peking by the joint action  of the Diplomatic  Body and in the treaty ports by that  of the consular  corps, which  has prevented  the  frequent attempts of  the Chinese to encroach on the rights secured to foreign  residents by the treaties.     It does not, therefore, seem to be desirable that the nationals of the enemy Powers should be deprived of  the use  and  control of their residential concessions  in Tien-tsin, Hankow, and  other treaty ports, their status and rights as residents in the International Settlement at  Shanghai,  the special  privileges connected with the so-called diplomatic quarter in Peking created by  the  1901 Protocol, or the privileges of extra-territorialjurisdiction, &amp;c, secured to Germany by  the Tien-tsin Treaty of 1861 and to Austria by the Peking Treaty  of  1869.     As regards the status of enemies and  their  property in our own  residential concessions, it would  seem advisable to provide that  no  public  building, such as  a consulate,  bank, or post  office, leased or owned by  the nationals  of the  States with which we have been at war, should be tolerated in future.     It may prove  possible to prevent  tin leasing of  sites  and buildings to  private persons  of enemy nationality in our concessions, such  as the  Shameen, where  land is held on the Crown  lease system, but there would be difficulties at places like Tien-tsin, where in one part  of  the concession land is  rented  directly from the Chinese owner. It must also be remembered that owing  to  lack of space and other reasons there are British private and commercial interests established  in the German concessions,  andthat we might expose such interests to retaliatory measures  if we withdrew facilitiesfrom, or imposed restrictions on, German  private  and  business interests in our ownconcessions.     The administration of the  International  Settlement at  Shanghai  presents manyserious anomalies and inconveniences.  Occasion should be taken to remedy these,  butin any case the elimination of the enemy interests from the Settlement does not appearfeasible, and it  must be admitted that before the war German officials  and residents,whose interests  and  property are next in importance  to our own at Shanghai, co-operatedharmoniously and effectively with the British residents in the  administration  of themunicipality and in the development of the principal treaty port of China.     In regard to Germany &apos;s co-operation in the International Bankers&apos; Consortium, thereadmittance of a German group and the restoration of its privileges under previous
  international loan agreements with  China will  depend on  the consent of the other  groups and the possibility of German finance being in a position  to  participate  in any  future group  business.   Both  contingencies appear suCciently  remote to make it  unnecessary to take special action in  this matter.       The Chinese Government may be expected to impose as a condition of peace with  Germany and  Austria-Hungary the remission of the Boxer Indemnity payments due to  those two countries, more especially  if His  Majesty&apos;s Government  and the Japanese  Government were to decide, as the latter have already done in principle, to forego their  shares in the remaining portion of the obligation.       On the  31st of January, 1916, Sir Edward Grey informed the Japanese Ambassador  in the course of a conversation that  His Majesty&apos;s Government  had no intention  of  putting  forward claims to German  concessions  in China,  and that therefore, if the  future of those concessions came to be discussed  with the Japanese Government, the  discussion would not be a source of difficulty between Japan and ourselves.   There has  been considerable doubt as to the exact scope of this assurance.  It has been interpreted  as a pledge that we will stand aside as regards the eventual disposal of the German  assets in  China, although it does not commit us  to giving Japan support as against  other Powers.  When,  however, the peculiar circumstances and especially the date of  this assurance are considered, i,e., a time when China  was still  neutral and  there  was  no question of her entry into the war  as  a belligerent against  the Central  Powers, it  can reasonably  be  argued  that Lord Grey could only have had in mind  such  German  concessions in China as  Japan could claim to succeed to as the natural corollary of her  military  occupation of Tsingtao, and in virtue of^the Shangtung Treaty with  China of  May  1915, but  that the assurance was not meant to apply to German railways, mines,  or other forms of industrial enterprises outside the province of Shantung and unaffected  by the Japanese military occupation&apos;, whether privately owned or owned in partnership  with other foreign groups, such as the German share in the Hukuang llai! way ; and we  have hitherto avoided recognising that any of such German concessions fall  within  the  purview of the assurance.     Probable Aims of the  Powers interested in the Far East at the Peace Congress.     Japan. Has  secured all the objects  for which she went to war, as stated in  the ultimatum delivered to  Germany.   As  explained in  the prefatory remarks to this memorandum, she has in addition profited  by the special conditions in the Far East to consolidate her position in  Manchuria,  Inner Mongolia, and Shantung, and to obtain by means of a series of loans to China a lien on some very valuable assets in that country. She has also secured the appointment of military,  financial, and other expert advisers, which will  give her a  certain measure  of control over  the military  and  financial administrations  and increased  opportunities of interfering  in the internal  affairs of China.   The efforts of the Japanese delegates to  the  Peace  Congress will, therefore, in  all  probability  be directed mainly to  retaining the advantages  and  territorial acquisitions secured by Japan in the  North  Pacific,  China,  and presumably Siberia.     China - Entered the war on the 14th August, 1917, ostensibly in defence of inter- national law and the principles of humanity which  the Central Powers had violated by their methods of submarine warfare.  There can, however, be no doubt that the considera- tion which weighed chiefly with the Chinese Government was their desire to be represented at the Peace Conference. Further inducements  were the  concessions  offered  by the Allied Governments in regard to the suspension for  five  years of the Boxer Indemity payments  and the raising of the tariff  to  an effective 5 per cent.  The  suspension of the German and Austro-Hungarian loans  and of the Boxer Indemnity payments due to those countries  was doubtless another  consideration.  It  is to  be anticipated that the  Chinese delegates at the Peace Congress will endeavour to raise the question of the restoration to China of Kiaocliow and of the  German interests in Shantung, in spite of the  treaties which  were  concluded  with Japan on  the subjects.   They  may also be expected  to protest against  any  agreement between  the  Powers which&apos; might be  regarded as  affecting  the independence and sovereign  rights of China,  and to seek  every  possible opportunity to  abolish  or curtail the existing extra-territorial rights and privileges of foreigners.   China will  also look to the Allied Governments to support her in  the event  of any claim for  indemnity or compensation being preferred by Germany and Austria-Hungary  in respect  of alleged breaches of neutrality, acts ofbelligerency, surrender of interned  vessels, recruitment  of  coolies, and all  measures taken  by  China against enemy   persons and  property  at  the  instance of her co-       [999]                   &quot;                      &quot;                     D
  belligerents.   China may also be expected to press for  an increase  of  her tariff, and  especially of the duties on luxuries.      America. The aims of the  United States Government have been foreshadowed  in the opening pages of this memorandum.      France. Is not known to have any special aims in connection with the settlement  of Far Eastern questions at the Congress.      Italy. Has shown a disposition to obtain the reversion of the Austrian residential  area in Tien-tsin, which adjoins her own  concession  in that port.      Portugal. Will probably  take the opportunity of  pressing  for  a  satisfactory  settlement of the Macao  boundary question.      Slam. Declared war on Germany and Austria-Hungary on the 22nd July, 1917,  owing to their methods oi conducting the war in contempt of all principles of humanity  and respect  for  small nations  and  in  flagrant  disregard  of international law  and  agreements, and  owing to the  scanty consideration with  which her former protests  were  met.      These motives  are probably genuine, as the Siamese Government  cannot expect to  get any material  advantages from  her entry into the war.   She trusts to  His Majesty&apos;s  Government to support her in resisting any claims for indemnity and compensation from  Germany and Austria-Hungary on account of the deportation of the enemy civilians of  those nationalities from Siam for internment  in India.  The Siamese  Government w)i  probably  make   it  a condition  of the eventual resumption of treaty  relations with  Germany  and Austria that these Governments  renounce the  privilege  of  extra-  territorial jurisdiction over their  subjects enjoyed  under the abrogated treaties.   His  Majesty&apos;s Government renounced this privilege some years ago.     Great Britain, In addition to the aims already mentioned, the following desiderata should be borne in mind for discussion if the occasion offers :      1. The entire  remodelling  of the  administrative  system of the  International Settlement at Shanghai,  with  a  view to  the control being vested in  the hands of the&apos; consuls of those Powers whose nationals form the majority of the foreign residents &quot;and own the bulk of the rateable property.  The  settlement  of the boundaries  and other outstanding questions with the Chinese.     2. The consent of the Powers to the  levying of  China of an increased import duty of 12^ per cent., such as  was contemplated in the hitherto inoperative clauses  of  the British Commercial  (Mackay) Treaty  of 1902, with  a view to securing the abolition of likin and all further internal charges whatsoever  on  foreign goods imported or  native goods  exported either in transit, at the place of production, or at destination.     3. The promulgation by the  Chinese Government  of adequate and up-to-date mining laws and regulations to enable foreigners freely to assist and participate in  the exploitation of China&apos;s mineral wealth.     4. The ratification  of the 1912 Opium Convention by all the belligerent signatory Powers, and especially by Germany, Austria-Hungary,  and Turkey, and the enactment by all  the Powers  concerned of the necessary domestic legislation to control the sale,production,  importation, and exportation  of  opium and its derivatives,  cocaine, and similar drugs with a  view  to the immediate bringing into force of the convention.     P.S. Since the above memorandum  was written opportunity has been taken to consult Sir  J. Jordan,  His Majesty&apos;s Minister  in Peking,  on certain  points of policy,more especially as  to whether it was desirable that the extra-territorial rights and special privileges previously enjoyed by German  and Austro-Hungarian subjects in China in virtue of treaties, agreements, and the 1901 protocol should be revived on the conclusionof fresh treaties and on the resumption of diplomatic  relations between the Governmentsof those countries  and the Chinese Government.     In reply, Sir J. Jordan has expressed  the  following views :      1. That the German  and Austro-Hungarian residential concessions at treaty ports should be internationalised and administered by local councils, which will include official and  local representatives  of China.   This implies that the leases of these residentialareas conceded by the Chinese Government under special agreements to the Germanand Austro-Hungarian Governments must  be abrocated.     2. That the revival of treaties with the enemy Powers would be a retrograde stepand would  be strongly resented by China.  He  added that, in order to avoid intrigue,it would be preferable, pending  the  conclusion of new treaties  with  other countries,which  would have to be undertaken shortly, to encourage China to conclude short and
simple agreements with the  enemy  countries,  which might include possibly a most-favoured-nation clause.     As it transpires from  Sir J. Jordan&apos;s reply that he does not share the view ex-pressed in the memorandum that a dangerous precedent vould be created if the ChineseGovernment,  when renewing  treaty  relations with the enemy countries, were to with-hold  from the  nationals  of  those  countries the extra-territorial rights  and  special privileges previously enjoyed by them in common with the nationals of all other powers in treaty relations with China, but, on the contrary, is of opinion that it is not desirablethat  those rights and  privileges should be  maintained  or  revived  in the case of the nationals  of the countries with which China has been at war, it was agreed, after con-sultation  with  the Board of Trade,  that  the policy recommended on page 6 of thememorandum, under the head of  &quot; Conclusions,&quot; should be modified to meet his  views.     It was accordingly decided that it would be preferable  to omit from the draft ofthe General Peace Convention any clauses providing :-     (1.) for the revival of the Treaty of Tien-tsin of the  2nd September, 1861, between           Germany and  China,  and the Supplementary Convention signed at Peking           on the 31st March, 1880;     (2.) for the revival of the Treaty of Peking of  the 2nd September, 1869, between           Austria-Hungary and China; and     (3.) for  the maintenance of the  rights which  German and Austro-Hungarian           citizens enjoyed in the International Settlement  at Shanghai.     It was further decided that, instead of providing for the maintenance with all their rights and privileges of the German residential concessions at Hankow and Tien-tsin andof the Austrian Concession at Tien-tsin, the Draft General  Peace Convention shouldstipulate that these concessions should be internationalised.     It is  therefore recommended  that the question of the  renewal  of treaty relationsbetween China  and the enemy countries and of the form the new treaties  shall take,should be left to the decision  of the Chinese Government, who, Sir J. Jordan considers,will not be disposed to renews the old treaties and agreements in  so far as they conferupon the nationals of the  enemy countries  special rights, privileges and immunities inmatters of jurisdiction in China.     The protocol of 7th September, 1901, under which Germany and Austria-Hungaryenjoyed their rights in the Legation Quarter  at Peking, stands on a  different  footing;it  is  a  multi-lateral treaty with  neutral parties and will therefore revive automaticallyon the restoration of peace.  There is no need to mention  it in the Treaty of Peace,  andthe draft is therefore silent with regard to it.     By adopting the above  course His Majesty&apos;s Government will  avoid  the responsi-bility and also  possibly the odium of having advocated  or concurred in the restorationto the enemy subjects in  China  of  the extra-territorial  rights and special privilegespreviously enjoyed by  them, and it  may  be hoped  that British trade and interestsgenerally in China will be furthered by the disabilities and  loss of prestige which theenemy subjects  will suffer owing to  their being placed in this respect  in  an  interiorposition to their British competitors.
