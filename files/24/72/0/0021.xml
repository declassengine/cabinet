Colonel W. Dally Jones.Circulated by th-3 Secretary of State for India,SECRET.[G.T.  6520.]    Memorandum on German East  Africa  by  Sir S,  P. SSnlia, K.O.     India  is directly and  primarily concerned with Gorman East  Africa only,  among the  captured German Colonies, and  I - will therefore deal only with that. Colony  in this Note.   I so  entirely agree with the cogent reasons advanced by General  Smuts in his Memorandum respecting German Colonies (Secret, B. 34, War Cabinet Papers) for  not  restoring German East  Africa  to Germany that I need not repeat those reasons,  I  am also  in  cordial  agreement with tho  position urged  in the India Office Memorandum on Indian Desiderata that German East  Africa  should, as a result  of the  Peace, remain a  part of the British Empire and  be  administered by and through the  agency of the  Government  of India.  I  will, however, briefly glance  at the position  of  this Colony in particular and of East  Africa in  general  as  it existed before the  war.  As His  Highness the Aga  Khan, whose first-hand  and intimate knowledge  of both  German  and British  East Africa entitles him to  be considered an  authority, points out in his recent  work  on &quot; India in Transition,1&apos; East  Africa had been the principal  field abroad for Indian  activity-in  higher services than those of manual labour for more than three centuries, and  from long before the partition  of the mainland dominions of  the Sultan of Zanzibar among European Powers.   In every branch, the development of agriculture, the  supervision of works of  public utility, the higher forms  of  skilled labour, the exercise of no insignificant share of political influence among the African chieftains,  all those were  in Indian  hands for many a decade before  Europeans began the work of thorough  and scientific  exploration  of the East  African mainland.  After the Germans acquired the Colony some time after 1885 the Indian  settlers in  that  part  of  East  Africa  continued  to thrive and the stream of  emigrants continued as before.  So sensible were  the Germans  of the value and importance of these Indian settlers, merchants,  and   traders, that so  late as  .1899 the  German  Government of East  Africa was  willing to  grant Indian agriculturist emigrants various rights and privileges  on condition that they should renounce their  British allegiance.   This offer,  however,  was refused on behalf  of the Indians,  and though for  some little time there was a  reaction in the relations  of Germans and Indians .in East Africa,  shortly before the  war  the  angle of  vision changed  again  and the  German authorities began to talk of placing the  Indians  in their colony on the same commercial and political level as the Greek settlers.  Then came the Great  War, and with it a radical change in the situation  in which the Indians in the Colony suffered severely,  at German hands.  We in India are naturally anxious  that the  position  of Indians should not be altered for  the worse because  of their unshaken allegiance  to the British  Empire ;  and that,  on the contrary, the loyal services of India  might  be recognised  by ameliorating  their position  in the only direction  in  which their  expansion  is possible, and  that  guarantees might be provided that they  shall  not become  subject  to restrictions  and disabilities  which ha&apos;ve had such a mischievous  effect on relations between India and other parts  of the Empire in the past.-     I would like to refer to the eloquent testimony  borne by the Eight HonourableMr. Winston Churchill in his  book li My African Journey,&quot; 1908,  to the part  taken by Indians in developing the. early beginnings of trade and the opening up  of  meansof communication in East Africa.   Sir Theodore Morrison,  after careful observationand first-hand knowledge of German East.Africa as a political officer attached  to the Belgian and other fighting units, came to the conclusion  that in  the interests  of the natives of that Colony themselves, as well as in the interests of India and the Empiregenerally, India&apos;s claim to have German  East Africa  made over to the Government  ofIndia for purposes of administration was incontestable.   The Secretary of State forIndia submitted a paper by him to that  effect  to  the Imperial  War Cabinet,  and I earnestly claim reference to that memorandum in support of the  claim  which  I nowurge.     2. Assuming that the colony is not  returned to the Germans, the  question will arise as to whether it ought to  be administered as  (1) a part of  the  South African Union, (2) as  a part of&quot; British East Africa,  or (3) independently, i.e., as a  CrownColony directly under the British Colonial Office or (4) under the Government of Indiasubject to  the  contiol  of  the  Secretary of State for  India.   As  regards the  first    JO SS 23   CO  12/18
alternative tho geographical j)osition of German  East Africa is  unfavourable  to  itsincorporation with the South African Union  and if 1. have understood General Smuts&apos;memo rand uni correctly, lie does not recommend this alternative, but on  the contrary,very fairly  points out that &quot;the Government of India have obviously also a right to be heard in regard  to  the  disposal of this colony.&apos;&apos;    The  Union  has  quite  enoughterritory to manage already, specially  if German South-West Africa is  added to it,as I hope it will.be.  As  regards (2) and (3) the experience of Indians in British EastAfrica makes me more than doubtful  as  to the wisdom  or justice of administeringGerman East Africa as a  separate British Colony in the same way as British East Africa.The experience of Indians in the latter Colony has been of the most unhappy description.Restrictions and disabilities which disfigure the relations of Indians to the inhabitants of the Slates now composing the South African Union and which  are in course of veryslow amelioration there, have been reproduced in British  East Africa with astoundingdevelopments.   The Indian setters in East Africa  are mostly of a  more advancedand prosperous class than those wdio had gone  to Natal  plantations under indenture,and the endeavour on the part of  a very small number  of White settlers to impose upon their 1 indian fellow subjects in British East Africa  ordinances and regulationsbased on an assumption of race inferiority has already produced a rankling sense ofinjustice which  strains  to  the uttermost  the relationship between Indians and theirWhite fellow subjects in British East Africa.  Attempts  are being made to reserve the best lands for  Europeans,  and a recent case in which  two Mahommedan barristersfrom  the Punjab were prevented  from landing at Mombassa,  notwithstanding the representations of the Government of India to the  British East African Government,is still remembered with  bitterness in India.  I. fear that if German East Africa wereto  be  made  a part of or  placed in  the same  position as  British  East Africa, the inevitable result would be that a very small section  of British,  subjects will bar theirIndian  fellow citizens from lands to which their  labour and  enterprise for centurieshave  given  them an unanswerable claim.   If,  therefore, German East Africa doesbecome a  British Colony  I  would urge  at least  that  assurances  should be  given to suitable Indians of the right of entry and settlement.    3. I recognise fully, of course, that the interest of the native inhabitants is  thefirst consideration, and I will be the last person to urge anything  which should  be inderogation of  their rights  to  a country of  which they are the original inhabitants.But competent observers have pointed  out how India can fulfil a civilising mission in east Africa with  even greater  efficacy than Europeans, and  to  my mind it is plain that if the Colony were to get into  the hands of a few thousand  White settlers therewould be little chance of Indians obtaining  fair play.   If, on the  other hand, german east Africa (and I would urge that the same might  be  done with British East Africa)were to be made over to  the Government of India tor the purposes of  administration the rights of all  parties, native Africans, Indian settlers, as well as European settlers,would   be  impartially   and   justly   looked  after.    The  restricted   field   ofemployment  in India for  Europeans in the  Indian Civil.  Service under  presentconditions   would  receive   large  expansion  and   the  talents  of  Indians   inall  spheres   of   social   activity   encouraged  and.   fostered   for   the  benefitboth of themselves  and of  the indigenous inhabitants  of  Africa.    I  am  aware,of &quot;course, that in order  to render what is  now German East Africa a portion of  theIndian Empire legislation  would be necessary, bit  there ought to be no difficulty inthe way of such legislation, and I for myself sec  no  insuperable difficulties in the wayof the Colony being administered by the Government of  India, subject to the controlof Parliament through the Secretary of State for India.   As I have said, this would ensure  the fairest solution of the  problem so far as  all interested parties  areconcerned.  If, however,  it is  found impossible to carry out this  policy, I would urgewith even greater insistence that whatever the alternative]destiny&quot;of the Colony, means should be  found and guarantees obtained for the protection of Indian settlers bothpresent and future in that Colorry.    May I point out in  conclusion  that India alone of the Empire,  would appear tobe about to receive directly nothing as a result of the war.  Great Britain  seeks tocontrol Mesopotamia and  other countries.  Australia and New Zealand  look for new&apos;territories in the Pacific,  the Union of South Africa hopes to add  German South-west to its territories, Canadians and the men of Newfoundland have at least the assurance of a warm welcome in all parts of the  Empire.  Is the &quot;Indian soldier to encounterdifficulties  in German East Africa?                                                                 S. P. SINHA.
