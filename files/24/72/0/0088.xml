During the week 6 outbreaks of Rabies were confirmed,  allef them in Devon in or near Plymouth. .  This brings the total numberof outbreaks up to 107,  of which 10 are  in Cornwall.          During the statistical week ended the 21th inst. therehave been 24 outbreaks of Swine Fever, 5 of Anthrax, 1 of Glanders,5 of Sheep Stab, and 100 of Parasitic Mange.

Rabies.   During the week in question specimens were receivedfrom 5 suspected outbreaks.                           Fisheries Division.     Dutch trawlers fishing out ,of fleetvrood.   Arrangements, whichhad practically been completed and under which  it was proposed that20 to 30 Dutch trawlers should fish out  of Heetwoed for theBritish markets, have been modified in view of  the altered situation created by the cessation if hostilities.   Dutch owners have been over to this country and have visited Fleetwoodf and although theneed for the assistance of these trawlers is no longer urgent, it hasbeen arranged, as a number of trawlers have been fitted ani crewsobtained, tc aocommodate 16 trawlera to  fish out cf this Port.Steps are being taken to obtain the release of  men from the forces who will be required in connection with the fishing operations ofthese vessels.     fcouaeholo Harbour.   The repair work tc this Harbour in aid *which a grant of r 500 ms sanctioned from the  Development Fund, hasbeen completed, and before authorising the payment of the balance ofthe grant, Mr. Hollingwerth, Ramsgate Harbour Engineer, has been instructed to inspect and report on the  work.   He has also beenasked to report on the additional repair work which the HarbourCourtis si oners1 advisers strongly recoraner.d ^should be carried out.     Location of Sheala of Fiah by Air Craft.   The Air Linistxyhave been communicated vdth in regard to the possibilities of theuse of aircraft for the purpose of locating shoals of fish.   It isthought that possibly assistance might be given where Air stations are likely ts be maintained in the vicinity of  fishing perts.   a communication cn the same subject has been received from theAdmiralty who are making enquiries as to the frequency with whichshoals of fish have been noticed by the  smaller airships and arealso preparing data as to the running and maintenance, costs ofthese small airships.Demobilisation
     Demobilisation of the roon&apos; en&amp;ap;ed An, the Pishing. Industry,.The demobilisation of fishermen and pivotal men in the fishing-industry is being proceeded with as rapidly aa possible andrecommendations in favour of the release of men Are being forwarded to the Ministry of Labour.     Motor Power in Fishing Vesaols.   A new field of activity haslately beon opened for the Committee&apos;s work on the River Mersey.          It appears that the men here had a very good object lessonin the value of the motor in Cardigan Bay last summer, when they saw a vessel which had very recently been engine! catchinglarge quantities of fish at times when they themselves were unableso much as to go to sea.          It is expected that upwards of six installations will  becompleted before the spring season if engines and labour areavailable.                       Intelligence Division.     Commercial Control Branch.   The work of the Branch has mainlybeen **f enquiries and cerrespon&amp;ence as to the improvement *)f ruraltransport and extended commercial control after the war, delay inthe delivery of seed wheat by L. cc N.W.R. and on matters arising inconnection with the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts and the Fertilisersand Feeding Stuffs Act.   One application for the Beard&apos;s consent to the institution of proceedings under this Act has been receivedfrom a Local Authority during the past week.          Local transport enquiries have been made in districts  inLincolnshire, Montgomery and Shropshire.     Publications Branch,    In the fortnight ended 31st Decemberthe number at applications for ordinary issues of the leafletswas  36, in response to which 3,190 copies were despatched.   Inaddition 18,000 copies cf the leaflets were despatched to applicants for supplies in bulk for distribution.   applications were received for 510 copies cf the three Bound Volumes cf leaflets;and 347 copies of the pamphlet &quot;How to Manage an Allotment&quot; were sent iut.   73 copies of the pamphlet &quot;Rats:  How to Exterminatethem;  and the Taking cf Wild Rabbits&quot; were sold.   The Decemberissue of the B*5ard&apos;s Journal was received from the printers an$Circulated tc the Press list,, subscribers, etc.     Flax Production Branch.   Since the last Report deseeding hasbeen maintained at high pressure, subject to the interval for the authorised Christmas holiday.   In seme cases three shifts are being arranged for.   A general tuning-up of the Stations now running  is taking place with reasonable expectation cf increasing the rate  cfoutput with the same labour.   This is shown by the fact that thedeseeding wages per owt. of seed turned out hab already been reducedto 10/7 from an approximate  1. per cwt.          To save dislocation of our emergency measures and to avoidcongestion of material it has been arranged for the Flax SuppliesCommittee to take deliveries of seed as turned out, and the detailshave been arrange! with that Committee with regard to stencillingaccording to type and consignment to Belfast.          The position with regard to the provision by the Office ofworks of the main factories is causing some anxiety through the difficulties and delays consequent upon the War time shortage Cflabour and material.   A general speeding up is tc take place now that hostilities have ceased and the position eased, the Office  cf                                                           Works
    works being Cully alivo to tho danger of the situation arising in    which the means cf conducting the later processes are not available    as and tfjien deseeding is complete.   Certain modifications ofi   policy are &quot;being considered with a view to render tho situation    more cafe in this respect.             A test with a patent attachment to a threshing machine    has proved, sufficiently successful with regard tc deseeding flax    as to cause the Branch to consider carefully for futuro years how    far a scheme under which the seed is taken off on the farm of tho    grower might be the basis of future contracts.             This is an illustration cf the fact that flax production    so far as labour and transport saving devioes are concerned in    dealing with a large bulk, is still in its experimental stage and    il may be that &quot;before flax production is established as a rural    industry, a modification in the relation between the farmer and the    factory mny ultimately be necessary, so that the deseeded straw only    is delivered for treatment, the farmer retaining the oe^d and ohaff,    Trials on these lines are being continued and very carefully    observed.        Officers Training Branch,     This Branch is now &quot;in being&quot;.             Preliminary steps have been taken to bring the Officers    Agricultural Training Scheme into active operation!   Local    Authorities have been circularised with a view to galooting farmers    to take officers as Agricultural pupils on demobilisation.             The Officers Agricultural Training Committee,  to adviss and    assist in ths execution cf th*) Scheme, and to seleat candidates    for Scholarships,  was appointed by the Prasidant cn the 21st   December under the Chairmanship of Professor T.  B. tfood.   The    Committee will hold its first meeting on the 3rd January 1910.             A Press Notice regarding the Scheme was issued on the    27th Decemberi   Numerous enquiries, both personal and written, ha-7*    been received from officers and it appears evident that the Schema   ha3 been well received and that numerous applications for   allowances and Scholarships under it will result.             An Officers&apos;  Booklet (L.S.9) on Land Settlement has boon   printed,  which includes particulars of the Training Scheme, and of   the method of making application for a Scholarship orallowanoe   thereunder.             Arrangements have he^n made both wiuh  thc* ,/ar Offioo and   Admiralty for a wide publication of the Booklet  in tho military and   Saval forces,  and also with the ministry cf Labour for copies to bs   available for Officers already demobilised or released.             Arrangements havo also boon made with  the Ministry of   Labour for information regarding the Training Schomo to Ico brought   unaer tho notice of Officers by Advisory Boards  who aro  proceeding   overseas  on 4th January to assist Offioers in- choosing a oaroer on   demobilisation.                           Land Division.Small Holding Colonies.  -        Patr infftonu   Tho  farming operations during  tho wo ok wore   ploughing, pulling and clamping mangolds,  and tho usual  seasonal work   on the  Colony;   Owing to the very late  harvest  it&apos;was not possible   to got  tho 13 acres of potatoes and 50 acres sf  mangolds up at an   oarly date,  as it  was  necessary to puaft on tho wheat sowings    The&apos;mangold
mangold pulling and potato lifting has been further delayed by the serious outbreak of influenza and the necessity of getting other land ploughed up for spring corn.

The winter wheats are looking well, particularly the fallow wheats. Some of the wheats sewn on clover "ley" are not so good.

It is hoped to carry out in the near future the planting of hedges, wind breaks, etc., on the Colony, in order to improve the general outlook and give the place a mere homely appearance.

Holkeach. The farming operations during the week consisted of ploughing and drilling wheat. As all the potatoes have now been harvested, the women and most of the soldiers temporarily employed have left. Many of the early potatoes are heating in the clamps owing to blight which is very prevalent in the district. Steps are being taken to get these turned and riddled and sold as soon as possible, but the local Food Controller reports a great shortage of trucks, and as there were 5 acres of "Eclipse potatoes on the Colony the beard propose to take special action with regard to this difficulty of transport.

Heath Hill. The chief work on the Colony during the week has been cutting and carting swedes and manure carting.

The actual acreages of winter corn on the colony drilled are:-

Wheat 163.038 acres

Oats 26.404 acres

Rye 14,183 acres

Total 205,625

All of which is now up and 1ooking remarkably well for late ? corn.

?elham Estate. The work referred to in previous reports is proceeding as arranged. The Estate Committee are now making final payments for the outgoing valuations last April, and the valuation as at 30th September last for Balance Sheet purposes is being completed.

The questions of most importance which are being investigated are those relating to labour and labour saving  devices.

(a) Labour. The Committee are endeavouring to secure adequate labour for the estate next year when a larger area is being taken in hand.

(b) Labour saving devices: (sugar beet lifters etc.) The Committee are investigating the question of the most satisfactory machines for lifting sugar-beet and enquiries are being made in foreign countries by the Board through the usual channels: certain British firms and American firms with offices in England, are also being  approached.

A  meeting of the  &quot;Administration&quot;  committee we  held  on the    18th.   Meetings were also  he,(i on the earns day of  the &quot;Allowances&quot;    end &quot;Cottages&quot; Committees to consider the determinations  made  by    District Wages committee as to the values  in their&quot;areas of the    &quot;benefits and advantages&quot; prescribed by  the  Board&apos;8 Order of the    6th September.              She &quot;Selection&quot; Committee met  on  Thursday, the  19th  inst.    immediately  before the meeting of  the wages  Board,  to  make    recommendations  to the Vmges IBoprd as to suitable persons to fill    vacancies whioh had occurred .?unong representative wembers of    District Wages Committees.              The twenty-fourth meeting of the Wages Board v/as hold on    the 19th inet.              A  large amount of  correspondente was reported in regard    to th** rats  of wages fixed  by  the  Board, and in regard to the    employment of prisoners of war in  agriculture.   A  motion, notioe of    which bad been given on behalf of  the Representatives  of  Workers,    for a general increase in the  minimum rates, was deferred to the    next meeting of  the Board.   Iho Beard also  decided st the next    meeting to go into the whole ejeetion of  the  policy  of  fixing the    rates on the basis of  &quot;customary hours&quot;.    In the matter  of the    employment of prisoners of way in  regard to  which the  Board had been    in correspondence with the War Office,  a resolution v?as passed to    the effect that  it would be  In the best  interests of agriculture    that the Government should  immediately take  steps to veleiise from    military service all agricultural  workers nt the earliest possible    moment,  and  that as the question was of paramount importance tho    Bonrd trusted that no  delay  would  take place in dealing with such                                                               an
an urgent matter. Copies of the resolution were directed to be forwarded to the Prime Minister, to the various  Government Departments concerned in the matter of demobilisation, and to the War Agricultural Executive Committee.

The Board adopted a Report from the Committee on "Selection" in regard to a change in membership on the  Yorkshire District Wages Committee.

Sir Henry ? presented a Report from the "Administration" Committee dealing with (a) questions as to the applicability of the minimum rates of wages fixed by the Board, (b) the position in regard to the effect upon the pensions of old-age pensioners, of the rates of wages specified in Permits of Exemption issued to them,    (c) the  question of reckoning as part payment of minimum wages lump sums such as Michaelmas Money and (d)  action taken in regard to cases of complaint of non-payment of the minimum rates. The Board approved certain  general principles to be adopted in dealing with questions as to the applicability of the minimum rates and    opinions were expressed by the Committee in regard to specific questions raised, based on such principles. In regard to the question of counting Michaelmas money, the Board are advised that as regards the period before the Michaelmas money, is ?

? paid, unless it can be shown that a worker has a contractual right to the Michaelmas money, he is entitled to the full minimum rate in each week irrespective of Michaelmas money, and that it is doubtful whether Michaelmas money could be reckoned as part payment of minimum rates of wages before the lump sum is in fact paid, even if the worker has a contractual right to it. This view, appears, however, to be contested in certain quarters,    and the Board have decided, if necessary, to test the point in a Court of Law. In regard to old-age pensioners, the Board have been informed that action is as a matter of administrative concession not being taken at present for reduction or revocation of existing old-age pensions in consequence of the pensioners returning to work or earning increased wages, so long as the means from every source, exclusive of old age pension-money, do not exceed 30/- weekly. This administrative concession does not apply to persons who are not already in receipt of pensions, and in such cases pensions could only be granted, if the means are within the statutory limits set out in the Old-Age Pensions Acts, and if any cases of difficulty arise in regard to persons who are not already in receipt of pensions, the Board would be prepared to take the matter up, if necessary, with the Treasury. In the meantime they are requesting the Board of Customs and Excise to ensure that their local Pensions Officers will act on the basis of the administrative concession referred to.

The Board authorised the institution of legal proceedings under section 4(l) of the Corn Production Act against three employers for payment of their workers at less than the minimum rates applicable under the terms of the  Board&apos;s Orders.

Sir Henry ? presented a report from the "Allowances" Committee which had had under consideration the determinations made by the various District Wages Committees of the value of Milk, Potatoes and Board and Lodging in their areas. The "Allowances" Committee were not, however, yet in a position to make final  recommendations to the Board, and the matter was postponed. In order to be able to deal with cases in which ? District Wages Committee has failed to determine the value of any of the specified "benefits and advantages",  the Board decided to amend their "Benefits and advantages" Order so as to provide that in the case of such failure the value might be determined by the Wages Board itself, and a formal Notice of Proposal
Proposal to amend the Order in this sense has been given. The Board adopted the recommendation of the "Allowances" Committee that no differentiation in the value of Board and Lodging should be made in the case of workers boarded on the employer&apos;s premises and workers boarded out by the employer. This decision affects the position of the soldiers employed in agriculture, all of whom are now required to be paid a cash wage which is not less than the difference between the minimum rate applicable to the area and the value at which board  and lodging is fixed by the Wages Board for that area.

Mr. Acland presented a report from the "Cottages" Committee dealing with the determinations of certain District Wages Committees fixing a lower sum than 3/- as the maximum amount at which the provision to a worker by his employer of a defect-free cottage may be reckoned as part payment of minimum wages in lieu of payment in cash. In all other areas the value at which a defect-free cottage may be reckoned will continue to be 3/- per week, as provided in the "Benefits and Advantages" Order, unless and until the District Wages Committee determine a lower sum. The Board decided to issue a Notice drawing the attention of workers to their power of appeal to the District Wages Committee in the case of cottages which are defective.

After consideration of the objections which had been received to the Notice of Proposal and of the reports of the District Wages Committees concerned, the Board made Orders fixing minimum rates for boys in Merioneth and Montgomery, and varying the Sunday overtime rate for Cattlemen, Shepherds and Horsemen in Oxfordshire, to come into operation on the 30th Docember, 191?.

After considering a recommendation from the Brecon and Radnor District Wages Committee in regard to the Board&apos;s proposal to fix minimum and overtime rates for boys in those counties, the Board withdrew their previous proposal and decided to issue a new Proposal to fix minimum rates on the same basis as those now fixed for Merioneth and Montgomery. The Board also decided on the recommendation of the Oxfordshire District Wages Committee to give formal Notice of Proposal to vary certain of the overtime rates fixed for boys in Oxfordshire so as to bring them into line with the corresponding rates for the neighbouring counties.

The Board decided to take steps at their next meeting to issue a formal Notice of Proposal to give effect to their previously expressed intention of providing that employment in excess of ?½ hours on one day in each week (other than a Sunday) shall be defined as overtime employment to which the overtime rates shall apply.          At the conclusion of the meeting the Board unanimously resolved to record in the Minutes the expression of their appreciation of the conduct of Sir Ailwyn ?ellowes in the chair during the first year of the Board&apos;s work.

The next meeting will be held on the 9th January, and if necessary, on the following day.

During the fortnight 170 cases of complaint of non-payment of the minimum rates were received, the largest number from any single county being 23 in the case of Cornwall; 40 cases were sent to the Inspectors for visit; enquiries by correspondence were made in 140 cases, and 28 cases were completed. Reports were received from Inspectors in 43 cases. Tithe
     Tithe, Gru.Li;ns , Cpjyh oldnand Survey Branch.    In connection withenquiries recoIvec!&quot;regarding*5g the revival fit compulsory redemptionproceedings the fjoardhave intimated that thsy would &quot;be ready toconsider applications by titheowners for compulsory redemption asagainst landowners in the following oases    (a) ,/here the land ics chirgod. with a tithe rent charge of any amount and has been divided since the last apportionment intonumerous plots so that no further apportionment, can conveniently bemade.    (b) here land has not been so divided, but is charged with oneor more tithft rentcharges not exceeding 20/- each,   The Beard will,however, as a  rule, order redemption in such cases, as against anyparticular landowner, only as to rentcharges not  exceeding in theaggregate 2o/-.   -There compulsory redemption would involvehardship to the landowner, tho order for redemption will &quot;be issued on the condition that the cost of redemption is to be paid by aterminable annuity for a short period,  say,  10 years under therecent Act,          Representations hive been received from the Herefordshirel/ar Agricultural Committee to the effect that powers should boconferred on the lvialvern Hills Conservators for tho better grazingcf the lands and commons on the ^alvsrn Hills and that ths betterregulation of the grazing on these lands would be of groatadvantage to the Nation in providing more food from the district.In roply the Board have stated that they have had underconsideration the questions cf improving the pasturage on commons andof regulating  its use, both of v/hich raise some difficulty, but areof sufficient  importance tc make it desirable that legislation should be obtained as soon as practicable to deal with these matters.            Joint Committee of the Beard of Agriculture and                   fisheries, and the &quot;Ministry of  JTOOCH          On the 19th and 20th December a Deputation ofRepresentatives from Glamorganshire and Carmarthenshire visitedHarper Adams College and was accompanied by the Deputy Director andmr, Abel Jones of Aberystwyth University.          Great interest was shown by the Deputation in the work qSthe Harper Adams College, and results of practical value areanticipated with regard to tho solution of problems met with indairying under the ploughing-up scheme hitherto regarded as insoluble.          The publication and issue of &quot;v/eekly Notes&quot; has proceededas usual,   A  revised issue of Leaflet Ho. 11, dealing with tho&quot;Calves (Sales) Order&quot; has been published, and memoranda dealingwith Prices Guaranteed for next year&apos;3 harvest, and future arrangements for the distribution of feeding stuffs have been issued.
