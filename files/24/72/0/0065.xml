IS rOCTOKT IS THE PROPERTY Of HIS  IRIPAMIC MAJESTY&apos;3 GOVERNMENT.)BJBCRJBT.                           IMPERIAL W^R CABINET,                          FUTURE SHIPPING POLICY.                         Hote by Mr. &quot;W. M. Hughes.             (Circulated with reference to Paper No. G.T. 6544*)      I regret I am unable to. agree to the recommendations ofthe Committee appointed.by the, wa.r Cabinet to deal with theproposals of the Shipping Controller that shipping should be free from requisition.      I have read most carefully the Report of the Proceedingsof the Committee and have no reason to change the opinion i expressed at the Meeting of British and Dominion Representatiressummoned by Lord Reading to discuss the future shippingpolicy. &apos;      In order to make my posit ion quite clear, I desire tostate that I do not object to release from requisition as such,but to the absence of safeguards against high freights for freecargo, viz: - other than Government cargo.   I should be quitecontent if the maximum applied to all cargo alike.   Thiswould place the producers of the Commonwealth in a position tosell on equal footing in the markets of the&apos; world.-(Signed)    V. It. HUGHES *Australia House.   27th December, 1918.
