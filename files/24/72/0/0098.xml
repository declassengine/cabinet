New Year Honours. The King has been &quot;pleased to give orders for the followingpromotion in and appointments to the Order of the Bath, in recognition  of services during the war :                              K.C.B. (Civil Division).    William Henry Beveridge, Esq., C.B., Second Secretary, Ministry of Food.                              G.B. (Civil Division).    Frank Herbert Coller, Esq., Assistant Secretary, Ministry of Pood.    Edward Frank Wise, Esq., Assistant Secretary, Ministry of Food.    Inter-Allied Food  Control. An Inter-Allied Commission  consisting of  British,American, French, and Italian representatives, with their headquarters at Berne, isat. present enquiring into the food needs of Austria proper.  Sir William Beveridge isthe British representative.   The  food conditions in Austria are serious and famineis threatened in  Vienna.   The problem ,of  supply is  aggravated by the financial difficulties in which the war has involved Austria.    Relief stores have been  sent by the Allies to Serbia, and further  stores are  ontheir  way.  Reports received  indicate  that  transport difficulties much impede  the prompt distribution of supplies.    The Food Council. At a meeting of the Council on Tuesday, December 31st, thefollowing resolution was passed :-          The  Food  Council desire  to record their  regret  at  the  approaching      termination of Mr. Clynes&apos; occupancy of the office of Food Controller and their      deep sense of the  valuable services he  has  rendered  to  the  country in  that      office.          On  behalf  of  the  whole  Ministry  of  Food they wish to  express their      appreciation of the ^ery cordial relationship which has been maintained between      Mr. Clynes and his staff during his term of office.          The Food Council  heartily wish every success to Mr. Clynes in his future      ; career.    The  Council  considered  the question of increasing the ration  of butter  and margarine to 6 ozs. in the near future and of  releasing margarine from the coupon.It was agreed that before coming to a decision in this matter it was desirable that anestimate should  be made of the probable supplies of fats which would be forthcomingduring the autumn and winter of .1919-20.    A revised schedule of retail  prices for  bacon, making certain increases in theretailers&apos; margin, was referred to  the Consumers&apos; Council for consideration.    The question of reducing  the price of flour in deference to the  representations ofthe bakers was considered.  The  suggested reduction would involve an  increase inthe subsidy of 8^ millions.  The Council decided that  the question should be deferredtill  the new Food Controller was appointed.  It was observed that if the bakers werein fact suffering loss it was open to them to seek economy by voluntary combination.    The Council received a report from  the Establishment Division of the Ministrystating that the reductions in staff in various branches of the Ministry would representa saving of approximately 200,0001. by the end of February in the annual salary list.    The period during which  the public will  be allowed the right to a free change ofretailers has been fixed for the fortnight beginning  the  20th of  January and ending the 1st February.    0-he  Imports Board. The Board have had under review the bacon and hamsprogramme in the light of the present situation.   Briefly, the position is that 113.000tons of purchases  in America still await shipment;  it is very difficult, if not impossible,for  this country to handle a greater weekly arrival  than 12,000 tons ; the provisional order  of 20,000 tons for January  would; if placed during that month,  really resolve    A (33)7008-4  Pk 9 145 1/19. E It S :  ,  &apos;;                                   A
 itself into an order for March or. post-March delivery ; if this order were placed during January  the  bacon and  hams  would deteriorate  before  shipment,  and this would mitigate  against  consumption, already considerably diminished;  the Treasury  take the view that, with the large quantities waiting for shipment in the United States,  it is inexpedient to place  further orders at Diesent.     On the other hand,  the United States Ibod Administration are very anxious that the maximum orders possible should be placed during January in view of the greatly increased production of bacon and hams during the past year in America.     The Imports  Board have agreed :         (1)  That in the  view of the Board no January purchases are required.        (2)  That as regards American purchases the question of the January purchasing              order should be referred to the Inter-Allied Meat and Fats Executive.     The question of the  unshipped balance  of l!xestle&apos;s  Mill,  amounting to 16,000 tons, was considered.  The Board decided  to  inform the Ministry of Shipping that private shipments cannot he allowed.     In view of  the fact that the  supply of  dried  eggs in this country is adequately assured, the Board have agreed to re-exportation.                          RELAXATION OH  FOOD CONTROL.     The extent to which  food control  must  be continued  in this country depends in large measure upon the general food needs  of  Europe, and  these have not yet been clearly ascertained.  Subject to  this general consideration, the view is taken  that rationing should be dispensed with at the  earliest possible moment,  that is to say, as soon as there is  a  reasonable prospect of supplies being adequate to meet the normal demand.  So  far  as  can  be seen, it will be  possible  very shortly to dispense with coupon rationing except in the case of butchers&apos; meat and butter.  Much  has  already been clone.  At  the time the armistice was signed  the following foods were rationed : Meat (including poultry, game, hares and  rabbits, pork, horseflesh, canned, potted and preserved meats, sausages and offals), sugar, butter, margarine, jam, lard, and tea (in fact if  not in name).  Since the armistice the Ministry  have freed tea from  restriction so far as individual consumption is  concerned ; lard has been similarly de-rationed ; poultry, game, hares and rabbits, pork, horseflesh, canned, potted and  preserved meats have been  freed  from  the coupon  as from December  29th;  offals were released  a month earlier.     It is hoped  that jam. and margarine may be released from  the coupon at an early date, but the position is not yet sufficiently clear to justify immediate action.     The sugar ration will be increased from \  lb. per head per week to f lb. as from January 27th, but it would not be safe to  de-ration  it yet.     There remain butter  and butchers&apos; meat.  In the case of butter there appears to be  at present a  world shortage of supplies.   The position with regard to meat is very uncertain.  Therefore,  rationing  for the immediate future is essential if unequal distribution and consequent&apos; queues are to  be avoided.   Up to now  the  shortage  in supply  of these two commodities has  been clue,  firstly,  to  the  world  shortage  of feeding-stuffs, in  particular  cattle cake (the  present  milk shortage  is  mainly  due to  this  cause) ;   secondly,  to  the  tonnage difficulties,  which  prevented  us  from drawing largely  on Australasian supplies.   This latter difficulty is now removed, and already an increase in the meat ration has  been effected as from  December 29th; The next six months should, see  a steady improvement in the  position, even if butter&quot;and meat cannot be freed  from the coupon.     Other restrictions such as those on the  sale  and use  of cereals  have already in large measure been abolished by the Ministry since the close of hostilities.     Import restrictions have been relaxed in the  case of apples, bananas,  nuts, coffee, raw cocoa, and other foodstuffs.     The  following   Orders  have  been  revoked  wholly or  in  part -as from 18th December:             The  Wheat, Bye  and Bice  (Restriction)  Order,  1917, and  the  Cereals       (Restriction) Order, 1918, so far as relates to rye.  Rye&apos; may now be used for       any purpose.            The M.aize, Barley and Oats (Restriction) Order,  1917, except in so far as       the manufacture of glucose is prohibited.            The Potato (Restriction) Order, 1918, the Potatoes  (Scotland)  Order, 1918       (Clause 3), and the Potatoes (Consolidation) Order, No. 2, 1918, so far as concerns     &apos;  the restrictions on  the use of  potatoes, other than sound ware  potatoes, except     &apos;  the prohibition on use in the manufacture of spirits.             -
                  The Apricot Pulp  and Bitter Oranges Order,  1917,  so  far  as  relates  to             apricot  pulp.  A licence is not now necessary in  the case  of dealings with             apricot  pulp.                  The Poultry and Game  (Gold Storage) 0&quot;der, 1918. A licence is not now             necessary to enable imported poultry and game to be taken out of cold store.                  The Pigs  (Sales) Order; 1918, has been  revoked as from 29th December.           .  The effect is to remove  most of the  restrictions on the slaughter and sale  of             pigs, including the obligation to sell  in markets.  The maximum prices of pigs             for slaughter are maintained.   The maximum retail prices for pork are reduced             by 2d. per lb.                                           SUPPLIES.           Cocoa. During December 1918, 13,400 tons  of  cocoa were shipped,  of  which        11,500 tons is West  African cocoa.  5,000  tons have  already arrived, and 8,000 tons        are expected within the course of the next few days.           Coffee. The Department  of Import Restrictions have agreed to  remove the Import        restrictions on coffee, and 4,000 tons  of shipping space has  been allocated to  India,        and the same amount to East Africa.           The question of export is  being carefully considered.           Dried Fruits. It  has been decided to  release from control Egyptian dates  as far        as distribution is concerned, but a retail price has been fixed at 10cZ. a lb.   Importers        will be allowed to sell their own imports instead of handing  them over to the Ministry        of Food, but the public will be protected by the fixed  price.           Small quantities of currants have arrived  from Greece, and 7,000 tons of Cali-        fornian  fruit purchased by the Ministry have been shipped, and are  expected to  arrive        within the next few days.           Meat. The double ration of meat which was  promised for Christmas was fulfilled        nearly allpver the  country in the form of  home-killed meat.   In  some few cases it        was necessary to supplement the supply with imported meat, but there is not a  single        complaint from any area  of insufficient supplies.  To appreciate  fully what this  means        it is  necessary to recall to mind the situation  at Christmas twelve months ago; at        that  time rationing was  not in operation, supplies  were extremely short, and  it was        necessary to dole out the small supplies that were available in single quarters of beef        where tens were required.           The supplies of  live  stock are rapidly diminishing, and while some small quantity        is possibly being held back for the  slightly higher price this month, the  aggregate        cannot he large, and the  grass-fed stock are expected to he finished by the middle of        this month.           Complaints still arise over the grading of the cattle, and although some measures        have been taken to put this right, the difficulty cannot be adequately dealt  with until  ,        Treasury sanction is  received for the appointment of additional supervisors of grading.           There is  still  considerable pressure upon  storage accommodation  for imported        meat.   the stores are full, and the  situation has not been rendered any easier by the        diversion of a  cargo which should have been discharged in France.           The revocation of  the Pigs (Sales) Order on  the 29th December appears to have        given very  general satisfaction.  It may for a time  have the effect of reducing the        supplies of  pork to the large  industrial centres, hut it. is inevitable that any step in        the direction  of de-control should be accompanied  by some slight inequalities of        distribution.           Potatoes. The  supplies of potatoes in all parts of the country  are fully adequate        to meet the demands, and there is a considerable surplus of potatoes which is available        for export.  Arrangements are being made for the export of potatoes  to France  up        to a  total  quantity of  200,000 tons, and the first order for  10,000  tons is now being        carried  out.                                  . i              &apos; . - .   ,           Certain modifications have been introduced  in the  Potato  Distribution Scheme)       with a view to relaxing  the strictness  of  control, in so far as is consistent with the        guarantees given to potato growers.           Tea. It  has been decided to distribute tea, for  export  only, by means of  public        sale, and the  first sale will take place on January 8th.  Prices  will be ruled by        competition.  It is  understood that the War  Trade  Department will  issue licences
freely for  non-blockaded countries for tea  sold in this manner, but that licences forblockaded countries will be limited  by the blockade ration.               ORDERS UNDER DEFENCE OF THE REALM REGULATIONS.    The Edible Offals Order, 1918, dated  20th December 1918, makes several smallalterations in the price of edible offals.    Order amending the Imported  Onions  Order, 1918, dated 20th December 1918,reduces slightly the maximum price for,the importer and increases the wholesalersmargin.  There is no change in the retail price.              PART  II. SUMMARY OF THE FOOD  POSITION.     A summary of the bod situation at the end of the year cannot be made until thefigures of stocks are available.                                    IlPOItTS.     The tables give the imports for the two weeks  ended 21st and 28th December(Tables A and A(l)).  The total imports of the principal foods and  feeding stuffsshowed an increase in the former week of 20 per cent, above the average, but a fall inthe latter week of 28 per cent, below the average.  This  fall is, however, seasonal in character, and is due, not so much to cargoes not arriving, as to importers not entering the goods during the Christmas holidays.  As compared with those during Christmasweek 1917, the imports show an increase.     In the week ended 21st December there were again  good  imports  of wheat  and flour (138,900 tons as equivalent grain), oats (14,400 tons), and meat (21,400 tons), aswell as  of tea (3,500 tons),  coffee (1,100  tons), and cocoa  (3,400 tons).  In  the subsequent week there were good imports of oats (13,500  tons)  and cocoa (3,500 tons),and  a greatly improved import of maize (15,600 tons).  In both weeks there were good imports  of oranges (9,900  and 8,500 tons) and apples (3,200 and 3,100 tons).     The totals for the first 17 weeks of the current cereal year  and of the precedingcereal year are compared in the following tableTotal Imports for the first IT weehs of the cereal year.-	1917.	1918.

The reduction is  more thanaccounted for  by the  fall  in wheat and other  cereals.  A summary is  given in  the table below from which, it will be seen  that the figures are in  many cases an index of the policy of the Ministry and are remarkable  for  the  large increases in bacon,lard, condensed milk, and tea, for the high proportion of flour to grain imported, andthe cessation of the imports of margarine,

Meat. In the two weeks ended December 21st large numbers of cattle and sheeppassed through the markets in Great Britain, and the estimated total supplies of home-grown meat were 19,000 tons and 23,000 tons respectively.  These supplies, however,must be regarded as providing largely for Christmas week, during which the live stockmarkets in England and Wales were closed, while a double ration was to be provided.It will probably prove to be the case that the double ration has  not been taken up.The quantity of  frozen meat released in the  two weeks was 5,500 tons and 6,700 tons respectively, thus  showing a high proportion of  home-grown meat in the  increasedrationed  quantity.  Since the signing  of the  armistice  Live  Stock Commissionersreport a greater unwillingness to accept ration restrictions, and the fact that estimatedconsumption has actually approximated  more closely to the ration quantity is possiblydue to the reduction in the purchasing power of the population.    Fish. Supplies of fresh fish  received at the  principal inland markets during thefirst weeks of December were  steadily maintained at an average of 3,600 tons perweek, which was 18 per cent, below the level of supplies for November,  Supplies atBillingsgate Market alone were steady, being approximately 15 per cent, below theaverage supply in November ; they  continue, however, to be about 40 per cent, abovethe supplies for the corresponding period of 1917.                                     STOCKS.    Stocks of meat and provisions on the 21st December have remained steady exceptfor a fall during the week of 2,500 tons in bacon, a fall of 2,400 tons in cheese, anda  rise of 1,300  tons in canned fish.  The Ministry storage of lard, was reduced hy4,000 tons, while the storage of bacon was increased by 2,100 tons, neither movementbeing yet reflected in the trend of total stocks.    A census of live  stock in Great Britain  was taken  by the Ministry of Food  onDecember  4th.  The  results  are not yet available, but in the meantime the monthlyestimate for that date prepared by the Livestock and Meat Production Committee ofthe Board of Agriculture may be taken as evidence of  the maintenance of the numbersof stock  this winter (Table D).  Starting in June below the level of  the  preceding year,  the total  numbers of cattle and sheep have now been raised above  those  ofDecember  1917.   In view of the scarcity of milk, the increase of the dairy herd isparticularly gratifying ; the number of beef cattle also shows an increase of 4 per cent.on the year before, but calves are  slightly &quot;down.  The reduction in the  number ofbreeding ewes occurs mainly  in arable areas, and  is no doubt  largely due to  theincreased acreage under crops; the effect will be felt in a smaller supply of mutton inthe coming season.  The inclusion of  cottagers&apos; pigs in the census of December 11)17prevents any accurate comparison of the numbers of pigs given in the table, but onthe Board of Agriculture  estimate for 4th December  1917 there has been an increaseboth in the breeding class (20 per cent.), and  in the fattening class (8 per cent).  Itshould, however, be  borne  in mind that the  weights of livestock generally are lessthan those of a year ago.
