    .       REPATRIATION OF BSLOIAl. REFUGEES.&apos;ltet.orandun by tho President of the Local Government Board,           At an early sta^e of tho War the Local Government Board undertook on behalf of the Government -the Quporvioion and care of  the Belgian Refugee a- who; fled to this country:  they have now, in conjunct ion with the Belgian Government, organised measures for the repatriation of the Refugees,           The number to be&quot; dealt with is-approximately 140,000, of whom  60,000 reside in tho Metropolitan area, and the balance chiefly  in industrial centres.-in-England and Scotland.  Host &quot;of the refugees belong to the peasant and industrial classes, and the majority are now-out of work.           The &quot;unemployment donation&quot; is not available for foreign workmen, and the Local Government Board havo, through their Local Refugee Committees, made all necessary arrangements for giving relief to Belgian workpeople who need it.           The Hinistry of Labour have made representations fco my Department as to the great importance of repatriating the Belgian workers, in view of possible labour troubles with our own people.  Similar representations have also been received from labour organisations in this country.           The Heard have been in communication with the Belgian Government, and have informed thorn that they propose to make preparations for returning the refugees to Belgium at a rate of about 10,000 a week during the months of January and February next and possibly later, and the official representative of the Minister of the Interior in this country has agreed that immediate steps may be taken to repatriate the Belgians belonging to Antwerp.           As 45 per cent of the refugees came from the Province of Antwerp, the repatriation of these people alone would occupy six weeks at the rate proposed.           Up to the present time the Ministry of Shipping have only been able to make provision for the return of the refugees by utilising, On their return trip, some of the vessels now allocated for bringing the repatriated prisoners of war from Holland, and five vessels have been or will be available up to December 22nd,           I feel,&apos; however, that the process of repatriation must proceed with greater rapidity and regularity than is possible under present arrangement a, and I have accordingly made urgent representations to the Ministry of Shipping request- ing tho provision of a regular shipping service to Belgium, for refugee purposes, as from the beginning of January next.  The Ministry have not, however, so far, been able to give any definite assuranco that this will be done.           While fully realising the many calls upon shipping at the present tine, and appreciating the assistance already given by the Ministry of Shipping, I feel it necessary to bring the question of obtaining an early and regular service of ships to Belgium before the notice of the War Cabinet,  in order that a direction ::ay be given to the Ministry to giveP:T,C,.
priority to tho repatriation v/orh of the Local Government board as far as practicable.          Apart from the desire of the refugees .to return to belgium, after four yearq of exile,  it is of great and urgentimportance to remove these large bodies of unemployed foreignworkmen &quot;and their families from the  groat industrial centreswhere their presence in districts already overcrowded is lihelyto cause grave friction and trouble  with the British workers,and to destroy the good feeling and harmonious relations built up since their reception as refugees in tbc ,autumn of 1C14;                                 &apos;  A. C. .0EDBES.&quot;Local Government Board,        Whitehall,. B.I.  1.          19th December,  1918.
