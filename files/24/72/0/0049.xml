fiHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP&apos; HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S QQVTOWIRNTijEOR ET,;  &apos;  -         ,  WAR cabinet.NET,5.  T. 6548, ., .             N AVAL  PA Y.              Admiralty Memorandum&apos; for War Cabinet,          The Board of Admiralty view with the greatestanxiety thO&apos; present position with regard to the pay ofOfficers and men of the Fleet,   While it is true that con-cessions have been made - and in ctrtain cases, especially as regards the men, these have been substantial - to meettho cost of living, during the war, they have almostinvariably been&apos;coupled with the statement that they are forthe duration of the war only.   The concessions have alsobeen made mainly in the form of Separation Allowances andChildren&apos;s Allowances, which can never be a complete and satisfactory answer to tho olaim of the Wavy for adequaterates of pay for their profession, as a profession, andwhich give rise to the impression that we are trying toavoid the larger and clearer issue.   Now that the terminationof the war is in sight there is undoubtedly an atmosphere, cfexpectancy and uncertainty in the Fleet to which it is imperative to make sympathetic response at the earliestpossible moment.          The loyalty of the Navy is beyond all pr ise, but none the less, several factors combine to make the presentmoment one of exceptional anxiety.          The extreme feeling of self-restraint which dominatedall othor feelings during the war has suddenly and inevitablybeen relaxed.   The just recognition which the country hasaccorded to the Fleet for its &quot;share in the victory, and the unanimous expression of the bellei that the strength and efficiency of the British Navy must continue to be the Empire&apos;ssafeguard, cannot but impress upon the men the value of their services.   Their own recent experience tell3 them that thework of tho United States and Dominion Sailors who have beenserving beside them is much more adequately remunerated.Renewed facilities for interchange of ideas with the civilpopulation arc also convincing them that,they have received as yet but a large meagre share of the advantage secured bycivilian workers.          For all these reasons there will  be,  not it may be hoped disloyalty, but very bitter resentment,  the ultimateresults of which cannot be foreseen,  if  nothing is done to assure the Fleet that their interests are being duly considered.          The question of recruiting  is  intimately connectedwith that of pay, and even already a  falling off in recruitinghas been observed.   The high rates of pay  in civil life andthe practical certainty of employment will  undoubtedlymilitate against obtaining sufficient volunteers, especiallyin the skilled branches of the Naval  Service,  and.it is onthese branches that the efficiency of the material of theItavy depends..   Wo are faced with the practical certainty thatin the near future few men will re-engage after their first12 years of service, i.e., we shall lose our very best PettyOfficers on whom the discipline of the Navy so largely depends.We shall moreover not only lose these men,  but they willspread prejudice against Naval conditions in the country.
     Along with  tho $il oat ion of tho pay of thj men, the  pay  of the Oiiicors must also bo dealt with.  The junior ranks  of Officers havo received some concessions amounting to a rise in pay of two or three shillings a day, v.ith Children&apos;s Allowances  in tho ease of those &quot;with families, but all  those concussions, valuable as they have been, aro for tho  duration of  the war only,   Tho Senior Officers have received no recognition whatever and ire serving on exactly the  same rato of pay, without any increased Allowance,, as in pro-war  times.   In fact it may bo stctod th^t Senior Captains have received no rise  in ;ay for the last 54 years, while Senior Accountant Officers of Commander&apos;s rank got one penny a day  more than  they did 63 years afOc   It is well known to Naval  members of the Board that many Officers oi tho Wavy havo experienced tho greatest difficulty in keeping out of debt and, in  some cases have not suceoodod in doinp so.   2v.&apos;olve months ago when concessions wore made to the junior Officers of both  Services, the Admiralty endeavourod to obtain an improvement in the position jf Senior Officers but protracted correspondence with tho Treasury has so far been barren of result.     Tho Board have no heSit.. ion in representing with all the  force and earnestness of which they tie capable that it is of urgent importance that the case of both Officers and men should be dealt with liberally and at once, and thtt it should be made  known that the matter is in hand.     There are clear si-ns that popular feeling in the country  is being awakened and is in favour of an immediate and g&amp;nerous improvement of the present conditions,   within the last week strong articles on the subject have aopcared in more than one newspaper.    It would be a deplorable mistake from the point  of view of the prestige oi: the Government, the authority of the Board of Admiralty and the discipline of the Navy if this improvement which is overdue arid inevitable,  should be brought about  in any othor way than by recommendation from theAdmiralty sympathetically received b;  tho  Cabinet,   The tra- dition by which thy Fleet looks to the Admiralty to Protect its  interests is not yet lost,  and in order that it may  be preserved I ask th,.t the Board should receive the authority of tho  tfar Cabinet to make an official pronouncement at once in th,,- following terms : -            &quot;Kef or one es having appeared in the Pro-&quot;s to     &quot;the desirability oi a sympathetic review of the. conditions     &quot;of service in-the Navy,  particularly in regard&apos;to  Pay,     &quot;the Admiralty dosire that it may bo  known to  the Officers     &quot;and men that  the -hols mention had  already been taken     &quot;in hand and tht..t they have reason to believe that  it is     &quot;intention of  H.M. Government to doal with the     &quot;Admiralty proposals  when  they  are ready,  en broad  and     &quot;generous  lines&quot;.i23rd, December,  1918.
