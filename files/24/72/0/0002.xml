  rPiis Document is the Property of His fcjritannic  lyiajest&apos;/&apos;^ G)vemrneot)WAR  CABINET,EXTENSION  OF POWERS UNDiSR DEFENCE OF THE REALM ACTS.sKencra-nduni &quot;by Lord Cave.         Referring to War Cabinet Minutes 511 (5) of the 10th Deoember,  1 beg to  report as follows         The Minister of Munitions  in his memorandum (G.T.62X) recommended  that  the bowers of the Minister  of Munitions under the Ministry of  Munitions Act,  1915, and the Defence  of the Realm Regulations should be extended so as ta  apply to the reinstatement  of industries after the conclusion of peace.         The Secretary-of State for War by his memorandum (G.T.6347) submitted  (l) that a similar extension should be made in respect of powers of the Army  Council and \Z)  that,  in view of doubts as to the validity of regulations  23^ and  7 so far as they apply to compensation, it should be provided that compensation  should not be recoverable otherwise than in accordance with the principles lairl  down in those regulations,                                 already         Effect has&apos; in substance Veen/given to the recommendations of the Minister,  of Munitions by  the Ministry of Munitions Act, 1918, and no^te^ need  now  be  taken in consequence of his memorandum.   This observation does not apply  to, the  memorandum cf the Secretary of State for War;   but I think that it is  desirable,  if possible^ to  deal with his recommendations, not by a separate Rill,  but as  part of the legislation required for continuing emergency legislation.         In this connection I &quot;desire to draw attention to a memorandum of the  Minister of Reconstruction (G.T, (?j597), in Which he suggests that in view  of  the delay which  has occurred in reappointing the Select Committee on emergency  legislation? an  extra-parliamentary committee  should be at once appointed  to  consider and deal with this matter.   I strongly support this recommendation  and suggest that a committee be forthwith appointed on the lines laid  down  in the memorandum of the  Minister of Reconstruction.                                                        C7th Deoember,  1918,
