Li..?-....- CABINET.                SALE  OP TP  SPORT--.TIOH EQUIPMENT TOwemorendum by sir aric Geddes.The (Seeretary to the gsr Cabinet,     r&quot;lth reference to your noto asking for my remarks on&quot;.ar Cabinet Paper G.T.6542 (Sale of Transportation equipment to the French Government.)    The  question raised by theSecretary of State for v,ar is a very big one, and I do notthink that it is susceptible of prudent decision withoutconsiderable detailed investigation, which may or nay not havebeen mode.     So far as Light railway rails are concerned, of whichthere are accordin . to the Secretary of rtste for &quot;ar some3,000 miles in Prance, I think that on the nhole it would notinadvisable to dispose of these, or the major portion thereof,to the French.  i,:het.her the whole  of the locomotives and thewhole of the roiling, stock should  similarly be disposed of Ido not know.   Por agricultural development of light railways in this country &amp; slightly heavier rail than, the one usedFrance on the 60-centimetre track, is desirable if thatgauge is adopted.   I do not know  whether this has beendecided yet.     As regards the broad gauge rails these are generally ofa. lighter section than used in this country at present, butare suitable for Colonial railways to some extent, and theColonial Office y.rould no doubt wish to put forward their demands.  These rails might also be useful-for feeder lins3in this Country.   -s regards broad gau^e locomotives and rolling, stock, some of this 1 have no doubt would be suitablefor use in this Country.  Some of  it would not, -rond probablysome of it is of an obsolete pattern which it would bo better to leave in Pronce if a reasonable /rice could be obtained for it.     .&apos;is regards workshop equipment I should imagine that itwould be very undesirable to sell  the machinery in the work-shops, fit any rate en bloc.     &apos;.s regards construction pl^nt for roads, doc&apos;-s and railways, I should think that there will bo o vary bigdemand for this in tbis country, and that is a natter&apos; hich wo v?ould h-ive to go into vith Contractors,  the RoadPoard,, Railway Companies and Dock Companies.  As  regardsroad plant wc nre under an obligation to Local Authoritiesin tho mottar.   In any event, although without consulta-tion vith the Ror-d Board, I venture tho o;5.rion that  it is vital to get all the  best road plant and men back to thisCountry at once.  You cannot start to build, hou-.es without first making, roads.
      As regards  Canal  plant  generally,  obviously  this question  must  depend u-on  the  canal  policy  of  the  country, and  whether it is  to be  pursued&apos;at the  present juncture.      As roj-ftrds  port and dock  equipment I should  think  a rood deal of it  is v.1 an ted  here  or  in the Dominions  and Colonies.      The  Pourd of  Trade  have no doubt P  ;-ood deal  of informstlon on these subjects,  bub I have not.      Apart from  any international reasons which may exist to the offset  that VTC  should assist  the French in  the rehabilitation of  their  destroyed  country,  there  is the question  of Finance, e.g.  the  increase  of the  indebtedness of France to this  Country, and  the further  question as  to whether we are in  any  way.Justified  in  sacrificing  ourselves to make up for the shortage  of  railway  equipment  in Prance prior to  the      From vbat I hove  said it will be evident  that  my view is that after  these  lares  questions  of  policy  u;?on  which the Cabinet should rronounco,  ths matter Is  one requiring very detailed  investigation and touching  the  policy of  very many Departments,   One  can  quite  see that the French desire an early answer,  and  that it  is possible for the  Americans to give  one  with  much les9  difficulty than  ourselves  -       (a)  because of  tho  ^reat distance of transporting    *        these  materials  back to  the  United States of             *  erica, and       (b)  because -merican  railways  have not  suffered             to the  extent which ours have  suffered               during the v:ar. But  I gather that  the  French will have  to place very large orders anyhow - and vrhile one understands their  anxiety to$et an early decision  I  do not  see exactly why ne should be forced into pivin  one before v.e have had tome  to consider the matter  in  greater  detail,   AS a  preliminary step it v/ould appear desirable to  catalogue,  with the necessary specifications, the  whole  of this plant and ascertain from the authorities concerned  *  the  Board of Trade, Colonial Office, India  Office,  Railway Executive Committee,  Dock Authorities, the Road  Board, and tort Conservancy authorities etc.  etc.  *  information  as to what plant and materials they would wish  to  obtain from  France, e*&apos;&amp; a v eneral indication from  the Cabinet nt  to the4:- views on the French financial situation and  on the International policy of assisting Franceand Belgium  in the rehabilitation of  their countries/&apos; Therewill, I fancy,  be  lsr-;o blocks  of material which v:e canundertake very shortly to sell  because we do not want it: others must wait for further consideration,     &quot; e should also  ?*nov-. the views cf  the Minister of Muni-tions as  to his desire,  on behalf of  the industries concerned,for orders  to  take the place of  this s  plant and material If it 1s sold  to  Tranceii      In fact tv, question raised is  a typical one of the demobilisation of  material as distinguished from the demobilisation of  manpower  in  the various theatres of war.
