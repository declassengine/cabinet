            /Oj                              21st December,  1018.       Proposed &quot;Telegraph Co Enrnmi cations Board&quot;,        : Admiralty Memorandum for the War Cabinot.     L gtf          The Admiralty have for some time been considering, tho-problem&apos;of  Telegraphic communications within the Empire whichsubject was raised at Imperial War Cabinet 42 (Minute 3) and havoarrived at the conclusion that in order to provide a rapid,  re-liable and  economical system of telegraphic communications,  therequirements of cables, land-lines and wireless telegraphy needbareful co-ordination.   2..     Apart from its purely warlike use,  Wireless Tele-graphy must play a large part in the development of trade, safety of shipping, and aerial navigation and should form the basis ofan Imperial News service by which all parts of the Empire willbe bound together in peace as it has been during the war.   3.     The Admiralty  have therefore drawn up a scheme forthe formation of, a &quot;Telegraph Communications  Board&quot;, whosefoundations and functions it is proposed shall follow the general lines shown in paragraphs 5, 6 and 7.   4.     In drawing up this scheme the Admiralty have receivedthe fullest co-operation  from the Army and Royal Air Force  whoagree entirely with tho proposals.  &apos; The scheme has also beenconcurred in by the Postmaster General except in one particular,viz:- as to the Department responsible for the Board,  which  willbe referred to later in this Memorandum.   5.     The general proposals ar^ -      (a)  That a Central body.for the control of tho W/T interests           of the British Empire should be set up as soon as           possible.           This body should be advisory and not executive.           That is to say, it will  have no telegraphic           apparatus or personnel under its orders and its           duties will be to advise the Government as to the           line of action to be taken &quot;by the  executive de-           partmonts concerned.   All the departments con-*-           cerned will be represented,  and the recommendations
     would embody tho collective professional know-     ledge of tho Government departments of th.e     Empire,     It would be in no wa/ concerned with the in-     temal administration of any one department, (b)That this body, to be called the Telegraph Com-     munications Board, should also deal with ..     questions of policy connected with submarine     cables,  telegraphs,  telephones,  etc.,  and all     matters connected with the policy of communi-     cations within the British Empire. (c)That, in order to expedite the formation of this     Board, it should be founded,  in the first place,     so as to embrace the Ifoited Kingdom and the     Crown Colonies only.  As soon as it ..is..fprmed,     the Self-Governing Dominions should be urged&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;     to set up similar&quot;Boards for themselves,  and,     when they have done so,  they bhould be invited     to depute gentlemen to represent their     Dominions on the United Kingdom Telegraph     Communications Board so that this Board can     then be raised in status to that of an Imperial     Telegraph Communications Board for the whole Empire.       flOEEz-  It appears probable that a similar Tele-                graph Communications  Boojrd will  be  re-                quired for India.   If such a Body is                formed it should be represented on                the Imperial Telegraph Communications                Board in a manner similar to the Self-                Go verning Dominions.   6,     It is recommended that the constitution of the telegraph Communications  Board should he as follows  (a)The Board to be under the general charge of the      Committee of Imperial Defence,  its scope to      include all Telegraph i.e. cable, land-line,      telephone,  wireless and visual  communications      questions 0      The functions of the Cable (Landing Rights)      Committee to be transferred to  it.  (b)The composition of the Board should be as shown      in the attached diagram,,   It is suggested that      a member of the Committee of Imperial Defence      should undertake the duties of Chairman, and      that the CVl.D0 should be requested to provide      the necessary psrmanent Secretarial staff.      The Secretary should be a Naval, Military or      Air Force Officer vdth experience of  Communi-      cations and would not be a member of  the Board.
      (o)  The members  of the Board should be divided into two             categories &quot;Permanent&quot; and &quot;Non-permanent&quot; all             of whom should receive all Agenda and liinutcs.             The  &quot;Non-permanent&apos;&quot; members vould. only attend             when required.   The representatives of the             Dominions would (in future) be &quot;Non-permanent&quot;             members *      (d)  The representatives of each Department should as far             as possible be permanentf  but they should be at             liberty to send substitutes when necessary.             NOTE:-  It may be necessary to detail two per-                      manent members from any one Department.                      one for cable questions and one for W/T                      questions,, but this arrangement would                      not give any Department more than one                      voice on the Board.  Decisions should not                      be taken unless the appropriate members                       are present.      (e)  All special inquiries and investigations required             should be carried out by Sub-Committees of the Board)             who should be empowered to obtain the assistance             of any technical experts,  whether employed by the             Government or not, that they may require.   7.     The duties  of the Imperial Telegraph CommunicationsBoard should be as follows:-     (a)  To frame the requirements for the provision of  lines            of communication within the Empire *     (b)  To regulate the conditions  governing the granting of            licences  to all private enterprises  dealing with            Telegraph communications  within the  Empirec     (c)  To fix the  standards of qualifications of W/T            Operatorso     (d)  To consider and advise on all questions of Telegraphic            Communications and questions  of policy concerning            Telegraph Communications  arising with Foreign            Governments and the Overseas  Dominions.     (e)  To deal with the International  Telegraph and Radio- .            telegraph Bureaux  in regard to all questions  res-            pecting Telegraphic and V;/T communications *     (f)  To encourage  the exchange of  technical knowledge            among the  executive Departments.-     (g)   To advise as  to the  general  line upon  which the  work            of  any Central Telegraphic  Research  Establishments            which may bo  founded by the Government  will be            conducted.NOTE: -  It will not be concerned with the internal          arrangements of any of the          Execut ive Departments.

Colonial Office Member.          frith a Permanent secretary who will not be amember of the Board, and the necessary Secretarial Staff,-placing the Board under any Department other than theGeneral Post Office, but it is understood that the objectionsto placing it under the C.I.D* are not as great as thosewhich would be raised if any other department of theGovernment were selected.   9:.     The Admiralty are not aware of any particularargument in support of the Postmaster General&apos;s view otherthan that the General Post Office has always been the statutorybody responsible for cablGs and that wireless telegraphy wastherefore placed under the Postmaster General.   10.    The Admiralty, War Office and Air Ministry are agreed that the Board should come under some neutraldepartment directly responsible to the Prime Minister^ since its decisions and advice must necessarily be guided bythe co-ordinated requirements of the four departments which require communications, Le., Admiralty, Par Office, AirMinistry and General Post Office.   11.    This would leave the General Post Office freeThe Postmaster General does not concuras to
to control the departmental work in connection with Civil communications, in the same manner as the Admiralty, War Office, and Air Ministry control the communications of the Navy, Army and Air force respectively. Further, this arrangement allows each of the four departments to have an equal hearing on the Board.

12. The Admiralty therefore urge that the Telegraph Communications Board be set up as soon as possible on the lines indicated in paragraphs 5,6 and 7 and press for the Board to be attached to the C.I.D.

13. The following are some of the urgent matters concerning the communications of the Empire awaiting action. No single Department can deal with them owing to the multiplicity of interests involved, and to the difficulty of co-ordinating these interests under the present organisation.

(a) Scheme for an Imperial Wireless news service.

(b) Counter measures to keep the British owned cables under effective British control.

(c) Erection of Wireless Stations by British owners in foreign countries.

(d) Wireless Telegraphy as an aid to sea and air navigation.

(e) Measures to raise the general standard of wireless personnel and materiel in order to facilitate and  expedite wireless comnunication.

(f) Co-ordination of cable and wireless communication generally to further the commercial interests of the Empire and for strategical security.

(g) To consider and advise on question of maritime signalling, other than Wireless, with and between Merchant  Vessels.

(h) To consider and advise on the application to commercial and navigational requirements of advances made during the war in various electrical methods of  communication.

(i) Revision of the International Radiotelegraph Convention and the service regulations appended              thereto.
