LUX!*KBURG,         (Note by Mr.  Balfour,  dated___30th Pecember,  19l8t  covering          a Note by the&quot;&apos;Pre rich Am bag s ado r 7&quot;&quot;da t e d 19 th Pe o em b e r, 191B).       I  circulate  to my Colleagues herewith a translation of a  Note from the French Ambassador,  regarding the desire of the  Belgian Government  to sond three  Belgian battalions to participate  in the  occupation of Luxemburgi       From the political point  of  virw I think that the request  Of the  Belgian Government  should  b** add^dei to.       Luxemburg is at pr*B*.nt  occupied by American troops and th^  assent  of the United Ste-t  s Government would I presume   hav to  combat obtained.   Military considerations are also involved and a  Cabinet decision  appears to me to be necessary.                                    (initialled)  A.J.B.foreign Office,   30th iVcemberi 19l8.(-208946A/39).          Trans lot ion of a Note f ro:-?s the Fr - no  Ambassador                       to Mr.  Balfour.     The Belgian Minister in Paris has brought to the knowledgeof Marshal Foch a request that Belgian troops might be allowedto participate in the occupation of Luxemburg,  Marshal Poch roplied that he v/as the Military Representative of the Allies andthat he could not, without authorisation, agre*v to the partici-pation of three Belgian  battalions in the occupation.     The French Government are of opinion that it would be well to  rant the request of tho Belgian Government, who attachconsiderable importance to it.     The French Ambassador would be glad to be acquainted withthe views of the British Government&apos;on this subject as soon aspossible.rench Embassy,    19th Pecemb&apos;-r, 191P.\
