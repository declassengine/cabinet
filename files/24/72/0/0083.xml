This reserve was used up inthe early stages of the war, and the absence of further materiel hada decisive influence on the rate of expansion of the British Army,     At the present time we are maintaining from 75 to 80 divisions and S Cavalry Divisions in various theatres,  As demobilisationproceeds, considerable quantities of warlike stores will become available, but apart from the needs of the British and IndianArmies in the future, large demands have been received from theDominions, and it is essential that the general policy as to the1 isposal of these stores should be settled on broad lines at an   iy date.     Sanction of the War Cabinet is therefore requested to themaintenance of equipment and stores calculated on the following basis it&apos; being understood that the Scheme is subject to revisionafter Peace is signed :-(a)   United  Kingdom -       an Expeditionary Force  of  5  Regular       Divisions  and  1 Cavalry Division       and for a  further 35  Divisions  and       1  Cavalry  Division, total  ,........,Infantry  Cavalry.
