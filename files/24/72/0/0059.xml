       I am somewhat  c once me &amp; at  the  memo,  by the ShippingController, (G.T06543).      He proposes  to  dispose of thenational Shipyards.      I  believe  that such  a proceeding atthis present  juncture would  give rise  to a  great deal of trouble,    There  is  a very  deepseated and widespread feeling in favour  of  retention of  those enterprises  which have forsome years now absorbed  national money.     Of course, I know that some  are redundant  and  the Cabinet  have already agreed totheir disposal,&apos; the matter having  been put up,  I believe,  atthe instance  of the Minister of Munitions through the EconomicDefence and Development  Committee.       But we should  -rooeod, I think, very  cautiously in dis-- losing of national property for -  rofit  making ;ur;oses*-If we do not,  there will Toe a big  political  outcry.-   Of course know that they might be run more cheaply at -present by privateenterprise, but at lecst the Government  h.:.s  not  as yet had afair chance of showing what can be done  under national control^In any case t; e time  is  inopportune, I believe,  for getting rid of them,                             (Initialled) O.NvB.2, Whitehall Gardens, .3%w*    87th December 191B,T7&apos;J3 DCCITJLI-.&quot;:&apos; I-\ TE5 PlCEiTY 0&apos;!&apos; Flo V.ITAMC H  JXTY1 ;  CrOvl:;.*Jl.t FT.                           .7 A H   ft I 3 I g E T.^Ti C it ISGo To 6558,                 MIOIUL 3BIIYAHPS..-                  -                 ^                        Me mo P by Vx.
