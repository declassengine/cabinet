These are all dealt with in a &quot;Weekly appreciation of matters of Naval interest&quot; which ia prepared solely for theBoard of Admiralty.   I enclose this document for the week endingDecember 14th, and shall be glad to hear from individual,members of the V/ar Cabinet whether they would line,  while these matters of general interest continue,&apos; to receive copiesof this Admiralty publication,, it being understood that such things ae the statement on the Military situation in North.Russia and other matterB are not considered as formal Navalreports but merely for the information of Members of t&amp;eBoard.        I would particularly invite the Members of the WarCabinet to look at the parts of the document dealing With theNorth Sea and Baltic,  Black Sea and Caspian, Red,Sea andArabia,&apos; and the German Naval.situation.   There is alsorather an interesting statement on the penultimate page culledfrom the statement made by Admiral Goette who is the german naval Officer in&apos;touch with the Allied Naval Commission forcarrying out the terms of Armistice.

WEEKLY APPRECIATION OP MATTERS OP NAVAL INTEREST - No. 1.            Weok onded 14th December, 1918.NORTH SEA AND BALTIC          The  main interest  during the  week  has  been oentred in the Bolshevik attack in  Esthonia.   Hoping to  tal.ee Reval before the  arrival of the British Squadron, Bolshevik troops, numbering 3,000, assisted by 4 armed ships  (probably T-B.Dts) , landed on the coast to the  west  of Narva on November 28th, and turned  the 19ft flank of the Esthonian  Army, coiopolling the latter  to retire towards Wesenberg and  Reval.          On december 13th,  the Rear Admiral, 6th Light Cruiser Squadron,  arrived at Reval with his Squadron comprising &quot;Cardiff&quot;, and &quot;Caradoc&quot;  &quot;with &quot;Princess Margaret&quot; and &quot;Angora&apos;&apos;1 and 7  Torpedo Boat Destroyers and landed 5.000 rifles and 150 machine guns for the use of  the Esthonian Army,  and left tho next day  for Riga and Libau.    Before leaving he bombarded the rear of the  Bolshevik positions on the Coast and also a bridge over/the River Pourtsioki.          He reports that the Esthonian Array numbering 1,500 (to be raised to 25,000) has joined up- with the Russian Volunteer Army numbering 3,000 (which  it is hoped to increase to  8,000),  under oomaand of  the  former, with tho immediate object of fighting the Bolsheviks.          Ice will  shortly prevent naval operations to tho Eastward of Reval,  and it is considered that the Bolshevik ships  will .show little  resistance, if encountered.          It is reported  that only tho  following ships of the Russian  Baltic Fleet  are in a condition to put to sea :-     Qrm&amp;21&amp;   -  &quot;Olog&quot;      )  Manned  by Bolshevik:  .                 &quot;Bogatuir&quot;   )  Letts and Bsthonians.     pestrovers - &quot;list ilin&quot;                 &quot;Azard&quot;                 &quot;Gavriil&quot;                 &quot;izyaslav&quot;         &quot;Coventry&quot; and &quot;Centaur&quot;, which had been at Danzigin  connection with the repatriation of prisoners of war,  havearrived  at  Copenhagen, and report that  conditions at Danzigare  quiet.         The Hospital Ship &quot;Garth Castle&quot;, and &quot;Versatile&quot;and  &quot;Vortigprn&quot; sailed for Copenhagen in connection with  there patriation of prisoners of war  but the two latter vessels are  at the disposal of the Rear Admiral, 6th Light  cruiser squadron, if required.         The Collier  &quot;Hollywood&quot;  carrying arms and  munitionssailed from Grangemouth for  Copenhagen where she has now arrived.OnSoorot.      For  the information of Members, of the.Board
          On lOfch Decorator  1 Hercules&quot; left Wilhelmshaven forKiel via  the Kiel Canal, and  &quot;Constance&quot; has subsequently sailed&apos;to  join &quot;Hercules1 in order to  assist with W/2? traffic.          s.s.  &quot;Rutland&quot; bringing torpedoes which wore still.to  be  surrendered from Germany  arrived at Harwich, and theGerman Transports &quot;Bremen&quot; and  &quot;Batavia&quot; arrived at Scapa inorder  to  repatriate the crews,  (beyond those necessary as care and maintenance parties),  of  the German Warships and have nowsailed, the former for&apos; Wilhelmshavon and the latter for Kielvia the Cattogat.          &quot;New Zealand11, &quot;Walker&quot; and &quot;Watchman&quot; have sailedfor Bergen in order to bring  the Queen of Norway and her sonto  this country.         Although the weather conditions were adverse for aircraft operations sixteen mine patrols were carriod out during  the week in Howe Waters.   On one occasion an enemy minewas observed and reported to  stirfade craft by a machine - anpatrol  from Westgate.                             ADRIATIC.          The Italian Naval Authorities are concerned as to whether the Allied V/airships in the Adriatic are still under Italian Coixnand, and have asked for a ruling, as they complain that French War ships are being sent to various points in the Adriatic without notification.          Several new dispositions have been made recently in the Italian Fleet.   The First Division of Battleships have been moved from Taranto to Corfu, and two Battleships of tho Seoond Division with attendant Craft under Rear Adiairal Mortola, have been attached to the British Co-ijander-in-Chief at Constantinople for service in the Black Sea.          The Command of the Upper Adriatic has been transferred fror$ the Comiiiander-in-Chief, Venice, and forined into a separate Command under Vice Admiral Cagni, lat.e Comrrjander-in-Chief* at Spezia, who has his Headquarters at Pola.    His Command includes the 3rd Division of Armoured  Cruisers under Rear Admiral Paladini, transferred from the Lower Adriatic, and stationed at Pola, and a Division of Destroyers, Torpedo-Boats,&quot;and other Light Craft under Roar Admiral Ruggiero, based on Pola and Fiume.          Another  new Coiinand has also  been formed*? that of the Couoander-in-Chief of Dalinatia, to which Vice Admiral Millo has been appointed? and he also holds  the post of Governor  of Dalmatian territories, with his Headquarters at Sebenico.   A number of Light Cruisers,  Destroyers and other Light Craft  have been transferred  to this Command and are based on Sebenico.          The Austro-Hungarian Fleet has been placed under Allied and U. S.A.  supervision at Pola  and Cattaro, with a few units at Sebenico and Spalato.          The functions of  the Allied Commission of Admirals who have been superintending the above, appear to have come  to an unsatisfactory end through the withdrawal of the French Admiral on the plea of ill health.It  . * o
         It lias been approved for Rear Admiral Kiddle to hoisthis flag in H.M-S. &quot;Diamond&quot; which arrived at Venice for thispurpose on 13th december-         H.H.S-  &quot;Woymouth&quot; remains at Brindisi until themiddle of January when she will be towed to Malta.                        1MM., SBA.Q.          Our immediate policy  in the Black  Soa is to  &quot;show the  flag&quot; at as many ports  as  possible and  at the same time collect  information as to the  general  situation.?  In  pursuance of this  policy and ensuring the execution of the Terms of Armistice Allied  Ships have visited Ode ssa, Nicolaieff, Kherson Sevastopol,  Eupatoria, Yalta Theodosia,  Novorossisk,  Batoum and  Trebizons, and Berdiansk,  Ghenichesk, Kertch and Marinpol in tho Sea of Azov.     The  Japanese Cruiser &quot;Nisshin&quot; and 4 Japanese Destroyers have visited Constantinople during the week, but have now sailed for  Salonika and Malta.          By  the Convention  of  December?  1917, South Russia was  divided  into  &quot;spheres of military interest&quot;, tho Prencii controlling  tho Ukraine and Crimea, and  the British the Caucasus and Trans-Caucasia-   The French are sending at once a  division of troops  to occupy Odessa and the Ulcrainet in the meantime 500 British and 500 French Marines are held in readiness to land  at  Sevastopol if necessary.          The evacuation of  German troops is proceeding slowly and much difficulty is  being experienced with transport- As transport by rail  is daily  growing more difficult, the Germans  have suggested  that  Gorman merchant vessels in the Black Soa may be usod to repatriate the  troops to Germany by water.          Communication  with  General Denikin&apos;s army (anti- Bolshevik) in the Caucasus has now been  established via Novorossisk,  and a list of his requirements in anas and am-munition etc  obtained.  He  hopes first to get control of tineUkraine  and  having  secured his rear commnications, to make a forward movement^gainst the Bolsheviks.         Tho Turkish Fleet has been paid off and placed under allied supervision-   The ex &quot;Gooben&quot; with a Care and Main-tenance  party has  been moved to the Fleet Anchorage  at Ismid.                          CASPIAN-         The British armed ships now in the Caspianare &quot;President Kruger&quot;, &quot;Venture&quot;,  &quot;Emile Nobe&apos;1% &quot;Allaverdi&quot;,&quot;Asia&quot;, &quot;Slava&quot;, &quot;Babiabut&quot; and &quot;Zoroaster&quot;..         In view of our arming merchant vessels, the BolsheMksare also converting ships into Auxiliaries and three RussianTorpedo Boat Destroyers and one submarine are reported to be atAstrakhan (under the Bolsheviks), and&apos; commanded by professionalNaval Officers.                                                  &quot;Zoroaster&quot;
          &quot;Zoroaster&quot; and  Allaverdi&quot; were in action withthe Bolshevik Fleet on 8th December,, but the action wasinconclusive.          The Bolsheviks are reported as establishing anice free  base 60 miles north of Chechen Island, and it isalso reported that they meditate an attack on Baku.Reinforcements of materiel and personnel arc being despatchedand the six C-MoB&apos;s recently sent to Mediterranean havebeen ordered to be sent on to Balm.          The Senior Naval Officer reports that an aerodromeis available at Balm and the despatch of air squadronsis under  consideration-          In view of Bolshevik tendencies in GeneralBicharakov&apos;s flotilla (2 Russian Gunboats and 4 armed ships now at Balm) the Senior Naval Officer, Caspian, has been directed  to consult with the military as to the feasibility of seizing Bicharakov1s fleet-   It is desirable that thisshould be done as it is impossible to undertake operationswith a potential enemy in the rear.          In this connection the War Office have sentinstructions to the General Officer Comuianding, Mesopotamia,and the General Officer Commanding in Chief, Salonika, forevery assistance to be rendered to the Senior naval officer.         As the Trans-Caucasus railway is now opened,and the present long telegraphic route from Baku to theAdmiralty (via Baghdad)  causes  considerable delay directionshave been given for the Caspian to come under the Mediterraneancommand as from December I5th-      Our policy is to holdBaku,  Enzeli and Krasnovodsk, and to attempt to establish an advance at Petrotsk,  for future operations against  theBolsheviks-
                  RED SEA &amp; ARABIA.         The Blockade in the Red Sea is being maintainedowing to tho delay of the Turkish forces in Arabia in complying with the terms of the Armistice.         On tho 14th December,  it was found necessary to attackHodeida owing to the refusal of the  Turkish garrison to surrender.  About 900 troops were landed and the town was soontaken with very few casualties, assistance being rendered from.M.S. &quot;JUNO&quot; and &quot;SUVA&quot;, .         Said Pasha, the Turkish Governor, and C. in C, of the yemen, surrendered at Aden on the 10th December., and our troops have occupied Lahej without further  incident,,         Fakhri Pasha, in Command of the Turkish forces atModina still holds out obstinately,  and we have warned theTurkish Government that should he persist in refusing to surrender,the Dardanelles forts will be destroyed.                   NORTH RUSSIA.          Active operations are practically at a standstill forthe winter, but patrol engagements and minor enterprises are of daily occurrence.  In the rear, organisation is steadily being&quot;pushed forward for further operations in the Spring,   Recruitingis continuing and the local forces raised now amount  to about   -3,000 all ranks, the total Allied forces to about 15,000.  OnDecember 12th a mutiny ocoured among the Russians at  the barracks, the men refusing to parade.  This was promptly dealt -   .with and 13 of the ringleaders were denounced by their comrades&quot;,and executed.GERMAN NAVAL SITUATION.  .

Tho remainder of the German El cot are in ports as reported in Admiral Mouror&apos;s statement, \tith the exception ofcertain ships  whoso movements have been approved by the allied naval Armistice Commission.          The  &quot;REGEttSBURG&quot; is working in connection with theCommission.          Tho present political position of the German CoastalDistricts, according to a statement made by Admiral Goette,  isas follows :-          Tho ojd Grand Duchy of Oldenburg, with a part of Prussiacxtonding to Emden, tho East Frisian Islands,  Heligoland and the town of Wilholmshaven, has been constituted a Republic called the Oldonhurg-Ostfriesischo Republik.  It is a.t present governed by a President (named Kuhnt) and a Workmen1^ and Soldiers&apos;Council of 21 members.  Naval Officers havo no longer any power,thoir orders having to bo countersigned by tho Council, but atpresent they still havo some influence-   Things arc,  howover,slowly getting worse, and those officers think that when the,Allied Naval Commission leaves, they may all havo to  resign fromthe Service oven if they a,ro not dismissed tyT  tho Council.          At Hamburg and extending down^the Elbo to CuxhavOn is another Republic,  governed in much the.same way.  Officers have practically no influence and the position is cvon more precariousthan at Wilhelmshavon.  Thero is a certain amount of  intercoursebetween tho Oldonburg Ropublie and the Central Government inBerlin, but hardly any between the Hamburg Republic and Berlin.          At Kiel the Berlin Government  has installed theSocialist, Noske as Governor, .and ho is  at present keepingtouch between the control Government and the local Workmen1sand Soldiers&apos;  Council and also with the  Officers, so  that theposition at Kiel is rather better than at either Wilhelmshavonor Hamburg,
          The Dispatch vessel &quot;YSER&quot;  escorted  5  tugs,  eachtowing one submarine, from Harwich  to  Cherbourg  These were theU,57, U,108, U.C.58, -U.B,126 and U.-139.  which  were surrenderedunder the terms of the Armistice.   The last  mentioned  is alarge S/K cruiser, said to be of 3,800 tons.          The ice-breaker &quot;FJKULA&quot;  was handed  over to  tho french navy on 12th December.          Arrangements wore made for a visit  of  British men-of-war to Huolva on 14th December and tho  Spanish 2nd Class Battleship&quot;PELAYO&quot; was ordered there to receive them on behalf of thoSpanish Navy,  ,          Tho Brazilian Squadron now at Gibraltar are leaving for Brazil early in January.          The long discussed project of transferring tho NavalArsenal to tho other side of the Tagus has again come to thefore.  It is said that tenders for  the contract  for carryingout the work will be called for immediately.                     JLSJL.          U,S* ships of war of all classes are being graduallywithdrawn from European waters.  No information as to thenature of tho service into which thoy will bo put is yet to head.As far as is known the tendency in political circles is to defer decisions as to future Naval Policy at least until anestimate of tho results of the Peace Conferonce can be formed.          The strength of the U,S, squadron on the coasts ofSouth America has boon increasod.  The U.S.A. are known to be making great efforts to increase their influence in south american countries with a view to trade expansion.   It isreported unofficially that a la,rge number of U.S. SubmarineChasers are detailed for the Far East, hut whether for Manilaor to show the flag and&apos; patrol Chinese Rivers is not known.Admiralty,  17th December, 1918,
