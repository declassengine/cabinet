Hon. G.N. Barnes  (in the Chair) ,The Rt. Hon. G.H. Roberts.            The Rt,  Hon.  H.W.  Forster.The Rt, Hon. T.J. Ltaonamara,LL.D.     Sir A. Griffith Boscawen&amp;ij tr J.L. Baird, C.M.G., D.S.O.      Mr, G.L,  Bar stow,Sir Charles Harris, K.C.B.            Mr. 0. Walker, C.B,Mr. f*A.  Bland.                             Mr, G.J1.Hodgson (Acting Secretary).1*&apos;   The Chairman informed the Committee that he hadreceived a memorandum from tho First Sea Lord, urging thata public announcement should be made by the Admiralty,informing officers and men that the whole question of payarid conditions of service had already been taken in hand,and that there was reason to believe that it was theintention of the Government to deal with the. Actai rait yproposals, when they were ready,  on broad ana generouslines; and that in the meanwhile separation allowances would be continued for a year after the war, and the wholequestion of pay and conditions of service then put on asatisfactory basis.  The proposed announcement was criti-cised on the ground that :-   (l) A similar pledge would bo necessary in the case         of officers and men serving in the army, and         would tend to render permanent the present high         rates of separation allowances;   (2) The proposal was very far-reaching in character         and should not be taken in hand by an expiring         Government.  If the announcement were made in         the proposed form, it would commit the         Chancellor of the Exchequer of the next Govern--         ment to heavy expenditure; and  .   (3) Any such announcement should be made in the name         of the Government and apply to all three services.      The Committee agreed to recommend to the farCabinet that a public announcement should be made in thefollowing terms      &quot;Referenceshaving recently born made to the        question of pay and conditions of service of       officrsand m^n in the Navy, Army and Air 8prvic.es,       and th- sam- having bnrn much discussed in the       Services, His Majesty&apos;s Government desir1 that       it may be known to the officers and men that the       whole question has already been taken in hand,       and that proposals ar^ in course of formulation.       Meantime-. ,  Separation Allowances will be oon-       tinued for the present,  and before any change       is made, the whole question will be broadly and       sympathetically&apos; reviewed&quot;.PRESS NOT I OS)K  PAY ANDCONDITIONS  &apos;)F  SERVICE,
I  t(At th$o  point  Mr.Barnes  and Mr.  Roberts  left  the Meeting  and  the Chair  was  taken  &quot;by  Er, Macnazaara.)5ALES CP WARFATUITIESOR REGULARPFICERS.&apos;2,   The ccmmittee considered the scales set  out,  (papersNo.113 and 114)  and decided to adopt the following schemefor officers in the Arm\,  viz:- 67 days&apos; pay  for the first year; then  1 a month for ranks up to Lieutenant-Colonel, 2 for Colonels and Brigadier-Generals,  and  3 for migher ranks.  Half increments for officers with no  service abroad.     The Admiralty undertook to draft a similar echeme for naval officers,  including however, Hfishipnien and warrant officers (to which there are no corresponding Army ranks),and to oub-divide the rates payable in the case &apos;jt Captainsso that Captains with less than three years&apos;  seniorityshould draw gratuity at the same rate as a Lieutenant-Colonel,  and those with more than three years&apos; seniority, at the ra-ie of/rull Colonel,     The committee also agreed that 67 days1  pay of an infantry Officer should be taken as the basis of gratuityfor regular officers in the Navy, and that the War cabinet should be so informed, but that no public announcementspecifying the basis of the&apos; gratuity should be made.     Mr. Bar stow suggested that thoBrigadier-Generals and higher ranksinitial rashould betes forfixed a;!;the             nearest round figure so as to avoid disclosing the basis of             the  scale.  This suggestion was approved.8ESSM3SNT OP   3.   Kajer Baird pointed out that an officer who servedOTITIES FOR  four years in the ranks and ^cs then promoted wouldTiJLAR OFFICERS reoeive  the same gratuity as an officer commissioned in;.I0TED FROM   the  last  year of the war, and would have a grievanoeIKS.&quot;TIRED  &quot;JjAR ?h&apos;(;CIRS  TEM- AIRILY LMPL0Y1D,through receiving nothing in respect of his service inthe ranks.     Sir Charles Harri3 pointed out that the rule that only service as an officer should count wouHd not lessen the gratuity which an individual might have received forhiB service in the ranks.   The scale for N.C.0.&apos;s and men had been ss designed as to ensure that a man promotedfrom the ranks should not lose in tho matter of gratuity by taking a commission,  it was administratively very corn-plicated to take service in the ranks into account; thebasis of 67 days&apos; pay for the first year was not justi-fiable if the gratuity earned in the ranks was to be paidin addition, and to abandon the 67 days1 meant a re-opening of the whole scheme of gratuities.     Dr. Macnamara suggested, and the Committee approved,that the Admiralty, when making their announcement asregards gratuities, should Btate that if in any case it was found that an officer promoted from the ranks received a lower gratusty than would have been the case had he not taken a commission, such case would reoeive special consideration.4.   The Committee agreed that all regmlar officers whoserved in tho present war,  should receive the fullgratuity according ta scale,  save in the case of such officers a3 have been cashiered or requested to send intheir papers,  or have been invalided out through illnossdue to their own misconduct.     Where a regular officer  had given a period &amp;f torn-porary service after retiring during the war,  such period should be amalgamated with his service before reoiri&amp;ient jbrthe purpose of assessment of  hi a gratuity under the scale nowproposed,unless he would receive a higher gratuity under toscale for temporary officers  based upon 31 days&apos;   /
Hi             pay for each year cf temporary service in which case he             would receive the gratuity calculated on the latter plan.Gratuities      5.  DR.  MACJAMARA explained that the proposal that temporarily-to temporary ary officers in tho Navy should receive a gratuity based onofficers in  100 days1  service for the first year,an  50 days1  for sub-the Navy.    sequent periods of service, was still under consideration byk&apos;             the Treasury.  If it were approved, the position of officers             who hed served in the R.N.A.S. required consideration,   &quot;&quot;ere             they to receive gratuities based on 100 days&apos;  pay, or were             they to come under&apos; the provisions of Article 497?                  MR. BLANI considered that such men should receive  the             rate of gratuity appropriate tc their rank in the  Air Force,             on the Navy scale for the period of their R.N.A.S, service,             and on the  seal under article 497 for the period after  join-             ing the Royal Air Force.                  The Committee decided that in assessing tho gratuity for             such officers, the following general rules should  apply:--                      (a) The rate of gratuity should be fixed  according                          to the rank held by the officer on the 11th0                          November, 1918*                      (b) Account should be taken of promotion of officers                          after the lithe November, 1918, but no regard                          should be paid in the assessment of gratuity to                          reduction of rank after that date.                      (c) The period in respect of which gratuity was paid                          should be determined by the statutory date for                          &quot;the end of the war&quot;j subject (as in the ease  of                          men) to a maximum period of 5 years,2,.
