fo^vment  is  the  property of His Britcrcnio    ;osty &apos;s Government? 1S           IMPERIAL  WAR Ql&amp;imilG511          hhSOhUTIOilS ON IIESCPOTAIIIA,  HQ3UL, BAGHDAD &amp; BASRA. 1.       There  can be no restoration of these territories to    Turkish rule. 2.       There  should bo no annexation of any of those territory-    ies by Great Britain. 3,       It is  the object of His  Majesty&apos;s Government to set up    an Arab government or governments of the liberated areas,and    not to impose upon the populations any government which is    not acceptable to then, 4,       Whether there should he a single Arab State or a number of Arab States  in these areas is a natter upon which educated native opinion  in the areas affected  is now being consulted. 5.       Ail reports so far received  appear to indicate a    universal repugnance to the incorporation of these terri- tories under a  single Arab-ruler, or  to the recognition of the    temporal sovereignty of the King of the Hejaz. 6.       If it  is found necessary to  provide in any form for    the authority over these areas of  the King of the Hejas,    this should  in all probability, be confined to &amp; REOOGNU/IOR    of his spiritual position, end to  the use of his name in the    prayers in the Mosques.   But the  Committee recognise that    this is a question for Moslem and  not for Christian opinion    to decide. 7.       Whether a single Arab State  or a number of Arab States    be set up in these areas,  the support and protection of a    Great European Pov/or will be found indispensable.
8.      If the inhabitants of these areas,  reting upon the  principle of self-determination,  express  a  desire that  Great Britain should fill this role, the interests of thenative populations, the past that has  been  taken  in their  recovery from Turkish misrule  by  the armies  of  Great  Britain end Indie, and tho security  of the Indian Empire,  require that the responsibility should be accepted by  Great Britain.
