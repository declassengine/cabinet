(b)  Not Involving a Stoppage of Work.-No serious dispute is in progress.                              I. General Remarks.The  Dispute  in the Cotton Industry.    The claim made by the cotton spinners and the Card and Blowing Room operativesin the cotton industry in Lancashire for an advance of 40 per cent, on existing piece priceshaving been refused, and subsequent negotiations under, Sir George Askwith having been unsuccessful, the spinners ceased work on the 9th December.   The strike at present affects100,000 operatives. Its continuance  will  inevitably result in a cessation of work amongthe weavers, even  should the dispute with which  they themselves are concerned on thequestion of  a 50 per cent, advance on their existing piece prices result in an amicable settlement.    During the war both the spinning and the weaving sections have secured an advanceof 60 per cent, on  pre-war rates, the  last advance having been one&apos;of 25 per cent, in themonth of June, 1918, but the fact  that, owing to the shortage of cotton, working hourswere heavily reduced, more than nullified the advances in a large number of cases.    In response to a claim of  the  spinners for a 40 per  cent, advance on current pieceprices the employers replied with alternative offers of 40 per cent, on pre-war piece prices(thus bringing the total War advance to 100 per cent.), or a reference to arbitration.  they stated, however, that if the  first of  these two offers  was not at once accepted  it wouldbe withdrawn.  The difference  between the claim and the offer of 40 per cent, on pre-war piece prices amounted to 24 per cent, oh those prices.    (C 1577)
    The operatives are  supported in their demand by a consideration of the very largeprofits winch had been  secured especially in the spinning trade during the past tvvlevemonths.   A special circular was issued by Mr. Frederick Tatter sail on the 4th Decemberdealing with this subject.  In that circular he notes a feature of the year which cannothut he looked upon as suspicious, namely, a tendency for companies to cease issuing balancesheets.  He analyses the total profit made by  40 companies which worked out at anaverage per company of  14,400  against  only  5,100 in 1917.  He records that statisticsfor the past 25 years proved that more money has been made during the past 12 monthsthan in any similar period in the history of the trade.  After allowing  for depreciation and interest the profits of Share Capital worked out at over 34 per cent.   He concludes thatthe height of prosperity  during the year was reached in July and August, when the margin of profit for spinners was abnormally wide.   Since then a distinct change for the worsein the trade situation has occurred and prices now being secured are much less satisfactorythan they were three or four months ago.    There appears little doubt that the present position from the point  of view of the spinning mills  is  anything but  satisfactory.  A merchant  writes to  the &quot; ManchesterGuardian &quot; to say that  prices of  cloth made from cotton yarn have  decreased  by 20 to33ij;- per cent, since the Armistice was signed.   An examination of the daily market reportsfor the month of December shows that business was practically at a standstill.   Buyersare holding off in the expectation of a further heavy fall in prices and even the most temptingreductions in quotations by sellers fail to bring about any transaction.   The&quot; market  infutures in America shows a gradual decline month by month until futures for April  readat 4^d. per pound below existing  prices.    The position appears to be that on the working of the past year  the profits would justify a material increase in the price-list rates, while the existing uncertainty of the tradeand the impossibility of forecasting the future perhaps justify the employers in makinga conservative  estimate  of what  they  are able to afford in this direction. It also seemsunquestionable that a stoppage of the mills at the present crisis is at the same time a  verydistinct gain to the  employers, and a  serious complication of a  labour position alreadydifficult owing  to Demobilisation and to  the  discharge of  munition  workers.  Thecase would indeed appear to be one eminently  suitable for arbitration.   The operatives,however, impressed as they are by the knowledge of the enormous profits earned in theindustry last year as also  by  certain  experiences in previous arbitration proceedings inwhich results have proved unsatisfactory to them, and finally strongly influenced  by theidea that  an impending General  Election increases their  chances of  success in  theiragitation, are averse from submitting their claims to arbitration in the ordinary way.    Action has now been  taken  by the Prime Minister, and Sir David Shackleton hasvisited Manchester and  succeeded in inducing deputations of employers and employed to accompany him to London, where a meeting  of the Prime Minister was held on the  12thDecember.    As a result of this meeting with the Prime Minister both parties to the dispute agreedfavourably to place before their  Executives  for approval, a suggestion  that an increaseof. 50 per cent, on piece price lists, which is equal to 32 per cent, on current wages, insteadof 40 per cent, on current wages, should be offered and accepted.                               II.-PRESS COMMENTS.                        (1) The Labour and Socialist  Press.                                  (A.) Military.The Question of Indemnities.  .    The Labour press generally  is hostile to the imposition of indemnities on Germany.Two lines of objection are taken.   First, that such indemnities would fall.upon the Germanworking class which was not responsible for the war,  which has now deposed the Kaiserand upset his Government and with which it is desirable  that British Labour should mani-fest its solidarity.   The  other point of view is perhaps best brought out by Mr. Brailsfordin the &quot; Herald &quot; in an article &quot; The Folly of Indemnities.&quot;  In this he points out thatindemnities can only be paid in goods, that the provision of goods to the enormous amountrepresented by the  indemnities Would mean dumping  on an unlimited scale and a conse-quent slack trade in England.  Mr. Winston Churchill has said that ships will be demandedfrom  Germany, and this, if acceded, will decrease the demand for new ships in England,and so tend to reduce the demand  for labour.  The only  correct procedure  is to reduce
  the national debt by a tax on Capital.  The &quot; Labour Leader &quot; reports a threat of occu-  pation of Germany by the allied armies till an indemnity of eight thousand million pounds  sterling is paid.  This is tantamount to slavery in that country.  This paper also points  out the  danger of dumping.   On the other side the  &quot; Clarion &quot; welcomes the popular  demand  for  indemnities which  proves that the British public is sound and does believe  that Germany is guilty.  The Fourteen Points.      &quot; Justice &quot; attacks President Wilson on this question.  No one power can have the  right to lay down a series of propositions for  which its delegates must strive up to the last.  as such a policy  would seriously divide the allied peoples.  The same paper doubts the  conversion of the German people, and points out that the whole of the people supported  the  war. and that even now the Republic has turned out our prisoners without food or  clothing, to make their way home as best they can in an inclement climate. Demobilisation.      The  delay in demobilisation and  the position of the demobilised soldiers is agitated by the leading papers.  The &quot; Herald&quot; alleges that there are jobs waiting for everybody. Even if this were not so, the men should be allowed to go home  at once  on furlough until they can get a job.  They should not be demobilised but discharged, and should not be recalled to military duties in any case. Conscription.      Several of the papers complain that the Government has made no definite pronounce- ment as to the abolition of conscription.  The &quot; Bradford Pioneer &quot; may be instanced, which  quotes Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s reply to a question  at one of his meetings.  He  said that Avhat we  should do would depend  upon what other  nations do, after general abolition has been demanded at the peace conference.  The paper thinks that abolition  should be demanded during the present General Election,  and that  the National Register and all records belonging to it should be destroyed. Discharged Consumptives.     The &quot;Herald&quot; continues its agitation  on the subject  of consumptive  soldiers,  arid prints an article by Captain Donisthorpe on this question, headed &quot; Forgetting the War.&quot;                                (B.) Foreign Affairs. Russia.     The campaign for the immediate  withdrawal of allied forces from Russia continues. The &quot; Call &quot; points out that if the Kaiser is to be tried for unprovoked war against Belgium, our statesmen are equally liable for the present operations against Russia.  The &quot; Herald &quot; prints at length a letter from Mr. G. W. Russell (A.E.) suggesting that the stories against the  Bolsheviks are much, exaggerated.  The  &quot;Labour Leader&quot; gives prominence  to a manifesto issued by the I.L.P., B.S.P. and the  S.L.P., entitled &quot;An  International Crisis  A Call to Labour.&quot;  This  manifesto  demands among other items the withdrawal from Russia, cessation  of interference with the self-determination of- nations in  the central empires, and  the withdrawal  of  the German blockade.   In its leader  dealing with this manifesto the paper appeals to British workers to manifest their solidarity with the workers abroad.  The  socialists of Germany and Russia have appealed to the  British workers to see fair play while their revolutions develop.   Surely British Labour will respond to the appeal.                                (C.) Home Affairs. The  General Election.     On this subject the amount of writing is voluminous, and of  such a miscellaneousand patchy character that a summary even if possible would be of little value.   The papersinsist that the campaign has become a  definite struggle between organised Labour on theone side and organised Capital on the other.   The &quot; Call,&quot; for instance, says that the twoarmies are aligned one against the other for the first time. The &quot; Labour Leader &quot; agrees,and points out that the Liberal Party,  which  has  usually disguised the real issue, is nowunexpectedly out of the way, and Labour confronts Capitalism in a hand to hand conflict.   (C 1577)                                                                 A 2
     Dealing with the Labour Party  manifesto both &quot; Justice &quot; and &quot; Clarion &quot; criticise it on the grounds that there is no clear call for the abolition of the wage system, that free trade is actually disadvantageous to the workers under the present system, that no recog- nition is given to the work of the  soldiers and sailors who have won the war, and that &quot; Justice &quot; demands continuance of the allied struggle against Bolshevism.  The &quot; Clarion &quot; thinks that the programme is indistinguishable in its essentials from the  aims of the tra- ditional Liberal Party.   The Labour papers express considerably more hope of success in the elections than they have previously  done.  The &quot; Herald &quot; thinks  the Coalition is wavering, and the &quot; Daily Maihs &quot; description of  Mr.  Lloyd George as &quot; wobbling &quot; is quoted in this and other papers.     The allegation that the soldiers are being cheated continues, and on this subject the &quot; Herald &quot; has an article which alleges that, so far from arrangements for soldiers&apos; votes having broken down, those arrangements were actually intended to prevent the soldiers&apos; vote.  Though candidates&apos;  addresses  had  to be posted at last a week before nomination day, alterations in the lists were permitted up to two days before that date.  The paper questions whether under these circumstances the  election is valid, and  thinks that the only way to  avert disaster is to have another election directly the soldiers get home.   On this point &quot; Justice &quot; also prophesies a second election before the close of 1919. The Albert Hall Meeting.     The  &quot; Herald &quot;  report shows that among the speakers were Major Gillespie, D.S.O., and Captain Donisthorpe, who are said to have spoken as soldiers on the  damnable treat- ment of the soldiers by the Government. Discharged Soldiers.     The &quot; Call&quot; has the following &quot; To reward the soldiers by dumping a few thousands on small holdings and leaving them  to fight for markets is both a heartless proposal to get rid of men whose heroism has become  an embarrassment, and a desperate attempt to pre- serve private ownership.&quot;   The &quot;Herald&quot;  alleges  that  strenuous endeavours are being made to get  men out of independent  organisations  into a new one, which will be run  by the Admiralty, War Office and the Air Board.Demobilisation of Munition Workers.     In its Trade Union and Labour  Notes the &quot; Herald &quot; states that the benefit is entirely insufficient.  It  also alleges that the  Government  has  asked Trade Unions not to pay anything out of their funds to their unemployed members in order that malingering may be prevented. This action is subjected to very hostile criticism.Government Factories.     &quot; Justice &quot; asks  whether the new  factories and improved machinery which have beenprovided at Government expense during the war are to go to Capitalists.  The paper recom- mends that they should be acquired  and run by the community for the common benefit.A  Call to Revolution.     The  &quot; Call &quot; publishes an article headed &quot; Audacity,&quot; which is an outspoken call torevolution in England.  It says that we will have a better time and a better land, and we will  have it now, and advises the working people to. take over the country and run it inthe interests of the whole people. The Labour movement should be adapted swiftly into an efficient means for accomplishing  the social revolution.   It should join in the Europeancleansing and purging.  The article  closes &quot; Maybe the  Cause will call upon us some  to live  and  some to die.  But we shall win.&quot; General.     The  &quot; Herald &quot;  prints a curiously inconclusive article by Bernard Shaw under the caption &quot; Nothing Doing.&quot;   The writer thinks that peace caught us so unprepared and came so fast that the khaki election is proving a  failure.   The cause of the sudden fall of Russia and of the central empires is to be found in the constant attacks of Socialism, which haveundermined the foundations.  The writer  criticises the action of the E.T.U. at the AlbertHall and  of the Seamen and Firemen&apos;s Union in connection with Mr. Arthur Henderson.He says that under a democratic Government the censorship of public meetings is not forthe E.T.U. nor that of travelling for the S. &amp; F.U.   Mr. Shaw thinks that  Foreign politicsare not understood in England.  He demands the withdrawal of the Russian  expeditions,
and ends with a warning that the air service between countries should be internationalisedand brought under Government control instead of being subject to private enterprise, as appears to be the prospect at present.                (2) The Daily Press  on  Demobilisation mid Resettlement.                       (A.) Discharges  of Munition Workers.   Women.      The majority of papers which make any comment at all on the various demonstrations &apos;   of munition workers which  have taken place recently are of the opinion that, in  the   words of the &quot;Daily Graphic&quot; (5th December), &quot;all munitioners could obtain private   employment very quickly if they were willing to  look for it instead of clamouring for   State subsidies.&quot;  The &quot; Globe &quot; (4th December) endorses this statement, and adds that   there  is plenty of work available in  domestic service and that &quot;it is monstrous that  the   taxpayers should be  mulcted in order to save these young women from the necessity of  returning to their natural work.&quot;      There are undoubtedly  a  large  number of openings for munition girls in domestic  service;  and this occupation  heads the list of the vacancies advertised at &quot;the Acton  Employment Exchange ; the others-according to the &quot; Daily Chronicle &quot; (5th December)  -including waitresses, post office  sorters,  shop assistants and laundry workers.  The  &quot; Daily Mail&quot;  (16th December) expects  that  recommendations  will be made that  domestic servants should live out and be paid an hourly rate, presumably in order to induce  the girls to enter service.  The same paper reports that a number of women from munition  factories in Yorkshire and Gretna are returning to domestic service.  Woolwich Arsenal  Employment  Exchange.      The &quot; Evening News &quot;  (4th December) describes the Employment  scheme  which  has  been established  within Woolwich Arsenal,  where a daily  bulletin  of  jobs  vacant  is exhibited in all the shops.  Firms from all over the country are stated to be sending  a notice of their requirements to the Arsenal.  This is a splendid example both of fore-  sight and of decentralisation. Government  Unemployment  Donation.     The &quot; Newcastle  Chronicle &quot; (5th December) publishes  a  letter from the  Chair- man of the Newcastle Advisory Committee in which he says that the donation will only be refused in cases where a Court of Referees has proved that the applicant has either :      (a) Refused an offer of suitable employment;     (b) Left work voluntarily without just  cause;     (c)  Been discharged for misconduct;     (d) Lost employment owing to a trade dispute, or     (e)  Is not capable of work.     The &quot; Birmingham Post&quot;  (5th  December)  reports a protest on the  part of the Local Executive  of the N.F.D.D.S.S.  against the inadequacy of the donation;  while the &quot; South Wales News  &quot; (5th  December) states that the  executive of the  N.U.R. has unanimously rejected the proposal of the Government that Trade Unions should suspend their unemployment benefits while the State scheme is in operation. War Pledges Bill    There appears to be consensus of  opinion among the papers which mention the War Pledges  Bill  that a satisfactory transition from war to peace industry will be impossible until the Trade Union privileges are restored.    Both the &quot; Yorkshire  Observer &quot; (6th December) and the &quot; South Wales News &quot; (5th December) contend that reorganisation is being hindered because employers and the Trade Unions are still uncertain under  what conditions they will be able to employ and be employed.    The &quot;Daily  News&quot; (5th  December)  foresees trouble  regarding demobilisationon this score among Trade Unionists, especially as the Government have not yet consideredthe amendments to the  Draft Restoration Bill put forward by the unions, which practically &quot;turn that measure inside out.&quot;
                        (B.) Demobilisat!on of the Army.     There appears to be considerable adverse criticism of the Government demobilisation scheme. Delay.     Several of the papers complain of the delay in carrying out the scheme.   The &quot; Daily Mail&quot; (5th December)  is  said  to.be  conducting  a &quot;stunt&quot; campaign against &quot; Dilly Dally&quot;  methods, while the  &quot; Times&quot;  (5th  December)  says that   the  Ministry  of Labour &quot; has  collapsed into chaos under the stress of work for which  it was evidently unprepared.&quot;  The &quot;  Sunday Times &quot; (8th  December) also attributes the  delay to the unpreparedness  of the Ministry ;  it declares  that  the  task of demobilisation should have been entrusted to a resurrected Department of National Service, because this possessed the entire records dealing with the calling up of the men.     The &quot; Daily Express &quot; (10th December), on the other hand, says that the obstruction is really in the War Office and the Army itself. Soldiers&apos; Complaints.     The &quot; Manchester  Guardian &quot;  (7th  December)  says that &quot; however  bureaucrati- cally perfect the Government scheme may be, the soldiers will recognise but one rule  &apos; longest out, first home.&apos; &quot;  Both this paper and the &quot; Daily Mail &quot; imply that the&apos;soldiers are far from confident that  the Government will be able  to find them jobs, and they also suspect that they will be kept in France until they &quot; can be pigeonholed into jobs at home.&quot; Soldiers on the Land.     The  scheme for settling soldiers on the land does not seem to be welcomed entirely without  misgivings.   For instance,  Dr. Addison is reported by the &quot; Scotsman &quot;  (4th December) to have   urged  that every soldier  should be guaranteed absolute  security of tenure so long as  he cultivates his land;  while Viscount  Chaplin, reported in the &quot; Morning Post &quot; (5th December), suggests that they should be established as absolute owners of small holdings.  He also doubts whether land settlement is desired by a large proportion of the men, and remarks that the opinion of the  soldiers themselves shouldbe  obtained before embarking  on any  large  scheme.   The &quot; Manchester  Guardian&quot; (5th December) is entirely averse  to any  scheme  for providing small  holdings for ex- soldiers.   This course, it is suggested, would &quot; set the spade in competition with the plough,&quot; and &quot; any man brought up in the country would  reject  the offer  as unprofitable  and un-progressive.&quot;                              III. DISTRICT  REPORTS.London and S.E.     Little is reported this week regarding the discharge of munition workers.   The Air-craft Manufacturing Co., at Hendon, is arranging to pay the men for 22 hours lost duringthe Armistice holiday, but many are claiming payment for 25 hours,     The London Tube and Omnibus Companies are  reported to be replacing women by men as quickly as possible.West Midlands.     The situation appears to be tranquil at present.  Some  annoyance is reported at birmingham owing to the retention of Chinamen in the various factories and the dismissal of British subjects.Yorkshire and East Midlands.     Trouble is reported in the lace and  building  trades in the Nottingham area.   The laceworkers employed in outlying districts  are demanding that the local price lists should bebrought up to the level of those operating in the centre of the industry.  Otherwise thedistrict remains undisturbed.North  Western.     It is reported that the demonstration of discharged munition workers at Manchester,who were proceeding  to  the  Town Hall to demand an unemployment benefit of 50s. aweek, was broken up amid scenes of disorder by  soldiers, discharged, wounded and inkhaki.  The Lord Mayor  promised that wounded soldiers should be present at any further
 meetings between him and munition workers, and this fact has rather damped the ardour of the discharged workers.  It is stated that the majority of shop stewards were nofcon- nected with the demonstration.     These latter held a meeting at Manchester over the week-end at  which  McManus urged them to spread their influence in the shops and to ensure that only men in sympathy with the Shop Steward movement and in close touch with workshop conditions were elected to official trade union positions.     There is some trouble  at Liverpool  over  the non-payment for 27 hours&apos;  armistice holiday by some of the smaller firms.  The shop stewards have decided to write to the Ship Repairing Federation on the subject.     A certain amount of discontent is reported among various members of the National Union of Dock and  Riverside Workers,  Liverpool.  The captains, engineers  and men employed on the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board floating plant have only accepted the Shipping Controllers&apos; recent award under protest, because it  does  not bring their total advance up to  the total advance  of other transport workers in the port.  The dock- gatemen, stagemen,  chainpitmen, etc., in the service  of the same Board are agitating to be included in the award given by the CO.P. on October 21st to all transport workers. Northern.     At Newcastle it is expected that there will be considerable opposition among members of the shipbuilding and  engineers trades to the employers&apos; offer of a 47 hour week.  A ballot  is now being taken among the boilermakers  on this proposal of the employers and on the claim, for a 44 hour week put forward by the men.   Opposition to the 47 hour week is expected to be stronger among the engineers, who  argue that a shorter working week might help to reduce the large amount of unemployment which is expected to follow on the demobilisation of the  army. South  Wales.     There is nothing to report from this area.   At a meeting of the  South Wales Miners&apos; Federation, the decision of the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain regarding the surface- workers&apos; hours was accepted.  The strike at the Bedwas colliery was also discussed ;  and although a resumption of work was recommended, the men persisted in their determination to remain out.Scotland.    No unrest is reported from this district.                                  IV. DISPUTES.    The general situation remains quiet with the important exception of the strike in thecotton trade.                         (a) Involving a Stoppage of Work.    The Admiralty Labour Department states that no stoppages have occurred in Admiraltyfirms.    The Ministry of Munitions reports that only 30 workers were on strike, and one strikeremained unsettled on December 4th.           A strike occurred on December 3rd at the Castner-Kellner Alkali Company&apos;s works owing       to the dismissal of a workman for making false statements in connection with his work.    The Coal Controller reports five fresh stoppages for  the week ending December 10th.In four cases work has already been resumed.           The strike at the Bedwas Colliery, South. Wales, continues, and an attempt is being made        according to the Press to stop the whole coalfield.    The War Office Contracts Department has nothing to report.
Reported from  Other  Sources.                                     *            The most  serious strike of the week is that of the  cotton operatives in the Manchester        district; this is referred to in Part I.            A strike took place on December 5th among the dock labourers at the Manchester Ship        Canal, Runcorn, they are demanding extra pay for discharging an unusually large steamer.            About  1,500 men are affected by a strike at the Abergerky collieries, Rhondda Valley,        which began on December 6th owing to the alleged unnecessary interference with some of their        number  by a fireman employed at the colliery.                          (b) Not Involving  a Stoppage of Work.     The Admiralty Labour Department and tfie Coal Controller report no cases.     The Ministry of Munitions reports two cases of minor importance.Reported from Other Sources.                                          *            At a meeting of the South Wales branches of the Boilermakers&apos; Society, held at Cardiff on        December 4th, it was decided to demand a 60 per cent, advance on piece-work rates and 100 per        cent, on clay rates, and to tender 21 days&apos; notice if such advances were not granted.     The  Court of Arbitration heard 7 cases in London and 13  in Glasgow during the past week.            These included (1) a claim for the Manchester district rate for anglesmiths, platers, riveters,        &amp;c, to be applied to the same classes of workmen employed at Salop, Staffordshire, Worcester        and the Midland district; (2) an application by the Scottish Council of Textile Trade Unions        for an eight-hour day for a five-days week and an increase in wages.G.
