W A R   C A BLUE T,26                           HOUSING SGHEiJEQ          Suggest iotts by :.lr, Chamjber It In on the, liemor ndum          fry the&quot;^rea Id elit&quot;&quot;oI&quot;The hoc.. &quot;1 Govern.&apos;;ohi Board                            ^&quot;Q T-,6497Jt                    1&apos;  THE RURAL PROBLEM.      The scheme proposed by tho President of the Local GovernmentBoard will, I think, give satisfactory results in the larger urban areas.   I aai more doubtful about its success in country districtsend such information as I possess is to tno effect tlwt there is noquestion on which the agricultural labourers and their wives feelmore strongly and that any failure in our rural housing policy will lead not only to keen disappointment but to bitter nnd dangerousresentment,      Tho points to which I especially dosiro to dr;w attentionare thro3 in number -   1.      uany if not mast Rural District Councils have not           among their members or their salaried staff the           business experience or capacity to carry out a           largo scheme *   To entrust the work: to these           Councils will load to certain failuref   Z (a)   If tho Councils or other public authority erect           grouped houses whore such ere required or possible,           is it to be expected that they should also erect           the  scattered cottages in ones or twos on the           various farms  which must be provided  for the stock-           uen,  carters and so forth?  Those cottages oust be          -on the farms,  cloae to tho homestead and they must           in the nature  of things be practically &quot;tied&quot;           cottages?     (b)   If tho government scheme dees not provide such           cottages, mast ;,o not offer facilities for           borrowing on tho summon terms to landlords to  enable           them  to build  taom?                                    %     (c)   And must we not allow and encourage, landlords to       *           charge an economio  rent for such cottages on their           p: ying the  county fair w/a-los?   3.      In any case will there  not bo many cases where the           landlord using  his  own resources can build more           cheaply than the public authority and is it  not oar           interest to encourage him to build and so to lighten           tho  immense task of the Government?                This point mis originally trucen  by i.r.  Long           and I thought  that  the  Cabinet assented generally           to his proposal that spoci&apos;1 facilities should be           given to landlords  who  wore willing to auild.
II.  ACQUISITION OF LAND.

On what terms is it proposed that the public authority should acquire land for hoasing? The moment Government announces its great scheme and local authorities begin to enquire into particular sites, owners in urban ? and and near villages will make excessive claims for building values. I hear for instance of Â£300 ? being ? in the neighbourhood of a small country village where no cottage has been built for years and the great majority of the existing cottages are unfit for habitation.

I suggest that, failing agreement, the land should be acquired at the valuation under the Finance Act 1909-10. I think this would be fair to all parties. As an urban landowner I should be well satisfied.

III. RATING.

I have already pointed out (I, 2(c)) that unless the land-lord in conjunction with payment of the statutory wage is allowed to charge an economic rent (i.e. an economic rent on normal cost) we shall stop private building for all ?. This difficulty is enhanced by the increase of rates which follows on any rise in rents and acts as further deterrent to building good cottages.

I suggest for consideration that the builder of such cottages should be secured-against rating at a higher level for a period of say 21 years. This would be an encouragement to him and it would not in fact deprive this locality of any rateable value which it would otherwise obtain since unless some such concession is made the cottages will not be built, or will only be built at the joint cost of the State and the Local authority.

I believe that it would be in the public interest to make this concession general and to apply it to all improvements but, ? that ? it may, it seems to ? absolutely necessary in the case of rural cottages which it has been customary to let at uneconomic rents to people who have received an uneconomic wage.
