 This Document is the Property ofHis L \    ;:( !    fs. Government.TIE RAILWAY SITUATION,Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade. //   At the beginning of the War practically the whole. otJhe railway Companies of 3-reat Britain were taken over by thegovernment under the Regulation of the Forces Act, 1871, andin 1916 the Irish Railways were also taken over.  That Actprovided for such full compensation to be paid to the Com-panics for any loss or damage they might sustain by exerciseof the powers of the Act as might be agreed to and in the caseof difference determined by arbitration.   As a result of negotiation it was agreed with the Railway Companies thatduring the period of control they should receive a guarantee of the aggregate net receipts of the Companies as for theyear 1913.   The Act provides that when it is declared by anOrder in Council that an emergency has arisen in which it is expedient for the public service that  the Government shouldnave control over the railroads the Secretary of State may byWarrant under his hand empower any person named in such Vfarrantto take possession.    This Warrant remains in force for one week only, but it can be renewed from week to week so long asthe emergency continues.   This course has been taken and th$Railways are&apos; therefore held on a weekly tenancy, but a guaranteewas given by my predecessor with the assent of the then Govern-xnent extending the period of the guarantee of net receipts to two years after the termination of the War, and a copy of LIr.]Runciman&apos;s letter is given below.My dear Claughton,     Many thanks for your private letter.,  ,The best reply can give you under the circumstances is to tell youwhat was decided at this morning1 s cabinet.,   jftrst we agreed that a concession to the railwayman was advisable- much as we all regretted the short life of the &quot;duration of the war,r agreement;  second, the General ManagerfsCommittee seemed to us to be tie proper instrument for negotiating with the men.   Third, they should do their best under the difficult conditions now surrounding theproblem,  fourth, the Government undertakes to extend theperiod of guarantee of net receipts to two years afterthe termination of the War..     You may show this letter if you think fit to anyof your colleagues who may care to see it,.     The control which has been exercised by the government under the powers mentioned is one that secures a control ofthe undertakings of the Companies and not of the Companiesthemselves.   The organisations of* the Railway Companies arenot disturbed and a Railway Executive Committee, composed of 5th September, 1916.Yours sincerely,   (Sgd) WALTER RUNCIHAN.General
     The problem that now confronts the Railways is how they are to obtain increased income ami diminish ezpenditoe-so as to offset the increased chargee,  assuming thin; thesecontinue when things become more or less auntie    The re isno doubt that through unified control a very considerablesaving can. be effected loth in the cost of operation and instandardisation of equipment&quot;additional revenue ciicharges ajthough this  ________  _____    ..       .......   .when the QQ% fcrease^in paseaxgei^ares; X&amp;M Ltern&amp;uAyor partially removed.                   f  &quot;NGeneral Karwgers, was set up which gives insmxc4d^mstothe Railway SowpaaiaiL as occasion arises.    This unirLed  &quot;*&quot;&apos;control exorcised by the Oommittee has  enabled  the Railways-to carry, and to carry swessfully, with a  depleted  staff and diminished rolling jitock, the eTiormDusly increasedtraffic in a manner that would not otherwise have beenpossible.   During the period of control some general alterstions have been made in rates and charges, but  no increaseof any consequence has been put on for  revenue  purposes andone reason for this was that except up  to the last few months-the railways were virtually self-supporting, if the cost  ofcarrying trie Government traffic, for which no charges were raised, were set off against the amount of compensation paidto the Railway Companies.     The &apos;50% Increase on passenger fares put on in  the   -beginning of 1917 was in no way based  on a desire for in-creased revenue, but was deliberately  intended  to reducethe number of people travelling inasmuch as  passenger services had to be largely restricted.     Changed ragss and conditions of service have apolied toall the Railways uniformly during the  period of control.At the outset of the War the Railway Trades Unions  agreed-withthe Companies that-they would not ask  for any increase  in wages, but this position did not last  for long in view ofthe increase in the cost of living and the increased wagesgiven in other industries.   The early advances in wagesgiven on the railways were negotiated  between representativesof the Railway Companies and representatives of the  Unions, -but the Board of Trade were kept informed of what was pasaijagand agreed in principle that such increases were necessary.Later on it was represented by  the Managers that further increases in wages were not in  their view com^rcitj.lvJustifiable and that they could not as repres jtatives ofthe Railway Companies agree to any further alv*rationsp  con-4equenvl.y succeeding increases  in wages were given by Direct JQStractions of the Board of Trade and the negotiations were [Oisluotsd by members of the Railway Executive Committee at pe  card of TradeTs request.    In the case of an &amp; hour lay, the principle of which was recently conceded with theconsent of the War Cabinet, instructions were given by theBoard of Trade directly to the Railway Executive Committee,     The net income of  the Railway Companies in GreatBritain, in the year 1913 was  50.000,000.    During  the Warincreased wa^es have been granted  and  other concessions suchas the  introduction of an 8 hour day have been given and  *are estimated hy the Railwav Executive Committee; to cost 70.000,000.   The increased expenditure  owing to the risein the  cost of materials is  estimated  at a  farther 20?000j000.   It will  therefore be seen  that  slnoo  the  ,(kvernment took over the Railways  the  estimated increased cost of wages and materials wipes  out  the net  iworn oi theRailwav Companies  nearly twice  over.   The position  of thoIrish ilailways  is even worse.
                It  is impossible  to forecast what the rtrture traffic          Trill  &quot;be  or what will &quot;be the permanent rate of wages or           cost  oi  maJterials,  bxrtrwfcatever relief may be derived from           any of these  sources it cannot possihly approach  90,0001000           a year,  and  therefore  the net income of the railways must           be much  less  than thai prior  to tie War, if not pracirically           non-existent.   As above stated the advance in wa^es and           the 8 hour day  together are estimated to represent an animal.           cost  of   70,0^0,000 which in  itself is an increase of 150$&apos;           on the pre-war wages paid to  the railwayman,   The Unions           are now  asking  for further concessions, either by way of           increase in wages or by alterations in other conditions,           which if granted  must  add still further to the cost of           working  the Railways.   The 8 hour day comes into operatipn           on the 1st February and there should therefore be no delay           in negotiating witn the Unions on the other points  they           raise so that any other alterations that may be necessary           may be as nearly  aa possible  synchronised with the altera-           tions due to  the  operation of an 8 hour day.   This raises -           another  difficulty inasmuch as  the representatives  of the           Railway  Companies can  hardly  be expected to lend  their assisi           ance  in  conducting the necessary negotiations with  the           Unions unless they first can  hava a definite assurance as           to the future position of the Railway Companies.    I re-           cently received the following letter from Lord Bessborough           as Chairman  of  the Railway Companies&apos; Association.                                         17th December, 1918,                Bear Sir Albert Stanley,                    I  happened  to meet  a few of my brother Chairmen                this afternoon and took  the opportunity, which you                permitted  me to do,  of mentioning  to  them  the  con-                versation  I  had with you yesterday afternoon with                reference  to the  General Managers assisting  the Board                of Trade in  their negotiations with  the Trade  Unions                on the  question  of hours, wages and conditions  of                service.                    tie all  felt  that the matter was  so  important  that                it  should  be brought  formally before  the Railway                Association, and  to  enable  this  to be done  I  should                be  much obliged  if you would  tell me  in writing  the                precise nature of the duties which the Government                desire  the General Managers to undertake,                     I  should like  to  add  that there  was an  earnest                desire  on  the part of  those whom I had  the  opportunity                of consulting to  render  all assistance  in  their power                to  the  Government provided  they could be assured  that                the nre-ftar  position of  their shareholders would be                adequately safeguarded.                                      Yours  truly,                                      (SGD) EESSBOfiOUGH.                I am therefore submitting: this &quot;&quot;Memorandum  for the           consideration of  the  V/ar  Cabinet and  I  should be  glad           if it could  be  considered at  the earliest  possible  date           and that I could  have  instructions  as to  the  oourse to be           taken inasmuch  as an early  decision apuears  to me to  be           most  desirable.Board of Trade,                        A.Hi STANLEY,    31st December,  1918*
