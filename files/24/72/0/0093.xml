(o)   The period In respect of which gratuity               is paid should be determined hy the               statutory date for &quot;the end of the war&quot;               subject,  as in the case of men, to a               maximum period of 5 years.         fd)   &amp;hy offioer vsho has been promoted from the               ranks  to a regular commission should               receive payment according to the  scale laid               flown in G.T.6E86 as approved &quot;by the tf/ar               Cabinet for&apos;his period of service Whilst               in the ranks in-addition to the&apos;gratuity               to which he had become entitled for his               service as a Commissioned Regular Officer.         fe)   In the event of a. temporary officer               receiving a regular commission, such               officer would not be entitled to any               gratuity under Article 497 of &quot;the Royal               &quot;/arrant for Pay, but only to the  gratuity               tc which  he would have been entitled as              - a Regular Officer, counting all his              &apos; commissioned service,  temporary or regular,               t oward s isuoh grat uity,         ff)   Any officer who has been promoted from the               ranks  to  a temporary commission should               receive payment of gratuity in accordance               with the  scale  laid down in G.T.6S86 for               his period of service  whilst in the ranks,               In addition to the gratuity to which he               had become entitled for his service as a               temporary commissioned officer under               Article 497 of the Royal Warrant  for Pay.^Soale of Gratuities for Rog?for-Offfloors of the Royal Navy.       The Committee recommend that the basis of 67 days pay should he taken as the basis  of gratuity for Regular Officers in the Navy with similar increments as recommendWor equivalent ranks of Regular Officers in the Army, The scale for Regular Officers in the Navy should,  however,  include Hidshipment and Warrant Officers fto which there- are no corresponding Army Ranks) and  it&apos; is- re oo amended&apos; that the&apos;rates payable ;in the case of Captains R.1L, should be sub-divided so that&apos;Captains with less than three years service in that rank should draw gratuity at the same rate as  a Lieut,Colonel and those with more than three years service at  the rate of a full Colonel,.
C  4*      Soale  of Gratuities to Temporary ftfficorsin the Royal Kavy,              The Committee raoommond that Temporary Officers          of  the Royal  Wavy should  reoeive  a  gratuity based on          10O days pay  for. the first, ye or&apos;.a service and 50 days          pay for  each  subsequent year or part of a year.              In making this recommendation the  Committee would&quot;          draw attention to the  fact  that the  R.H.D.,  has served          continuously  under Army orders and  Army conditions  of pay          and service,  and  is officered  by  temporary Officers of          the Royal  navy.   The  Committee therefore recommend,  that          t&apos;.e scale  of  gratuities to  be  paid  to  all temporary          officers  of this  Division should  not be at the  above         naval  rate, bat  should  be at tho  rate  paid to temporary         officers  of the  Army&apos; as laid down in Article  497 of the         Royal  Warrant  for  Pay.  ,              V/ith  regard  to tho Royal  Navy,  it  is  recommended that          in  assessing  the  gratuity for  Regular  ana  Temporary Officers          the same  general  rulos  should  apply  as those  laid ^dwn         for the Army and  Royal  Air  Force  in  Paragraph 2.(Intld),   G.H.B.2,  -hltehR.ll Gordons,  3/7,1*     7th Janusry, 19191
