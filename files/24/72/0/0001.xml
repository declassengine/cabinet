       Memofandura by the^Pres.1dent of the Local Government Board.%               I circulate a Note prepared in my Department on the      First Report of the Land Acquisition Committee (Cd.8998).                               A,  0,  GEDUSS.-&apos;al Government Board, Whitehall.      16th December, 1918.      (l)  All are agreed that the multiplicity of methods of acquiring land compulsorily is unjustifiable  and that a moreor less uniform procedure is desirable.      (2)  The main question from the Local Government Boardpoint of view is whether - so far as local authorities areconcerned - it is better to extend the Provisional Order and departmental Order system as suggested by the Murray committee or to&quot; set up the new procedure suggested by the Leslie ScottCommittee.      (-3)  The Leslie Scott Committee oppose the first so faras Departmental Orders are concerned on the ground that -       (a) Quasi-judicial functions of Parliament should notbe delegated to executive departments.       (b) Officials tend to adhere too closely to officialformulae and stereotyped methods.       (c) These officials do not. decide anything, but reportto official superiors and their reports are not published.       (d) There may be competing claims for  particular piecesof land and the individual Departments are not competent to reconcile or decide between, these claims.,  (No instances ofthis are given, and no such case has been heard of in theLocal Government Board).     (4)  The Leslie Scott Committee are also opposed to a standing Commission, which tends to lose elasticity and becomeguided by its own precedents.  All Standing Commissions, suchas the Development Commissioners, they suggest, are &quot;more orless committed to certain special interests or methods&quot;.  Inother words, the system of precedent,  upon which all judicialdecisions in this country have been given - inoluding those bySelect Committees on Private Bills - is held to be a bad one.The fact that the Government Departments who at the presenttime confirm Orders or make Provisional Orders for theoompulsory purchase of land have records and precedents whichthey consult and follow, and have officers of experience andtechnical knowledge in dealing with such considerations asarise in connection with compulsory purohase and full know-ledge of the requirements of the District for which the works and land are required,  ia apparently regarded by the committee as a drawback because it is supposed that it cannot cp-exietwith the &quot;element of elasticity&quot; and &quot;breath of fresh air&quot;which is valuable to all parties.  This argument may surely
&quot;be carried too far.      (6)  The Ooumittee state that  &quot;it is  obvious  that  no adequate or fair decision sanctioning the  compulsory  appro- priatien if private property for a  pubjio  purpose  can be arrived at by any Authority without considering the general merits of the undertaking&quot;.           This is of course  true, and the  real question to be considered is whether the general merits  of the undertaking and the real need for acquiring particular land can best be determined by a public Department containing men trained and experienced in dealing with  these questions  or by  a tribunal opnsisting of two or three men  picked out  of the general list whioh has been framed by a  Selection committee before of Parliament.           Chosen in the latter  way  the  Tribunal may possess common  sense,  but they will  have no expert knowledge  and must depend  for this  on expert evidence.   Such  evidence is notoriously untrustworthy, and  it has  sometimes happened that Select  Committees of both Houses of Parliament have been unable  to decide upon schemes before  them    beoause the expert  evidence  on one side  was flatly  contradicted by  the expert  evidenoe  on the other.   Swansea  sewage was a Conspicuous example.           The  practice at the Local  Government Board  is to appoint,  as far  as possible, experts  in the  particular problems  arising,  to  hold the looal  inquiries.  If land is required  for a hospital, a Medical  Inspeotor holds the Inquiry;   if for housing, a  Housing Inspeotor;  for water supply, sewerage,  gas  or electricity, an Engineering Inspector who  has  specialised in the  particular matter.           This fact  reduces  the need  for expert evidence and the explanations  of  such evidence by Counsel  to a minimum.      (6)   We are  concerned here mainly with looal authorities, and it  is  to be  feared that  as regards local  authorities the proposals  will prove much more expensive than the existing system  except  in  the  very exceptional oases in which,  a Provisional  Order  being necessary,   it is fought not only at the local  Inquiry  but  also in both Houses of  Parliament.  As a matter  of  fact opposition  to compulsory purchase Provisional Orders  is  very exceptional,  and only one case in  the  last  15 years can  be recalled  in which a Provisional  Order issued  by the local  Government Board for the Compulsory purchase of land was  lost, and in  that case (Bradford)  the owners  sold voluntarily  a  year or  two afterwards.      (7)   The new  proposals will, in most oases,  certainly not make  for speed so  far as local authorities are concernedwhen compared with a system of Departmental Orders.           Take the case of land required for  housing  in  a rural district under Part III of the Act of 1890.          Under the present law the  local authority make anOrder, serve it on the owners &amp;c,  of the land and advertiseit in 2 weeks  in a local newspaper.   The owners have  a month to object,  and if they object,  an Inquiry is  held by  one ofthe board&apos;s Inspectors after 2 weeks1 notioe  to  those concerned.   After consideration of the Report the  decision  isgiven, and the proceedings are at an end.   Counsel and expertwitnesses are not allowed except with the Board&apos;a  consent.
           Preoumably under the new procedure the resolution to  acquire corapulsorily must be served on the owners, &amp;o,, and they must  be given an opportunity of objecting to the Sanctioning.Authority either on the ground that other suitable land  oan be found or that the powers of the local authority  are  not being judicially exercised.  The Sanction - ing Authority  will probably wish in the first instance to have the views of the local authority on the specific allegation- tions.  They will also have to find a Panel who oan serve, and notify the Board with such particulars, e.g. plans, as will enable the latter to submit.their views through a representative at the Inquiry.  They must give notice of their Inquiry at which Counsel and expert witnesses can be heard. The Inquiry must take place and the Panel must consider and, if  there is more than one member, must agree their report, which has  to be published, and make an Order giving their decision.   In  practice it may be expected that the time occupied will  be longer than under existing prooedure.   But this  is not  all.           There is the further difficulty that this Board will still have  to  inquire into the Housing Scheme itself and sanction the necessary loan, unless this is to be done by the Sanctioning Authority simply because in the particular case land is to  be  purchased compulsorily.  If the Board were responsible  for both matters,  one Inquiry would suffice.  It is  difficult to see how the Sanctioning Authority could settle a Scheme involving financial assistance from the State.      (8)   The  Committee,  as already stated,  object to a Standing Commission,  but it is difficult to see how their own proposals  can  avoid degenerating into a Standing Commission. It  is recognised that they must call in experts.  Naturally they  will  call  in the same expert on the same subject.   Theymust have  a staff to  make their arrangements and draft thenecessary  formal documents,  and it is to be anticipated that in  time precedents will be recognised if only for the sake of  securing  some defensible unity of practice.   Ultimately the  &quot;element of elasticity&quot; and the &quot;breath of freshness&quot; is likely to be lost.      (9)   The  conclusion to which one is led is that if theCommittee&apos;s Report is adopted so far as companies and persons other than  local authorities are concerned,  as it probably should be,   the  question whether local authorities should alsobe brought  under the  new scheme to any extent,  should be separately  considered.        *  wliere the case is one. which can be dealt with byDepartmental Order not requiring confirmation by Parliament,there seems no  good ground for not retaining the present procedure.   It would  also seem that there is no particular reason why  the  procedure by Departmental Order, which extendsnow not only to land  required for housing and small holdingsbut  also to school sites,  should not be further extended to any  purpose for whioh a local  authority con acquire land underthe general law.          If this were done,  the new Sanctioning authority would be restricted,  as regards local authorities,  to dealingwith  purposes  which heretofore properly formed the subject of bills for Local Acts;  and if  the Sanctioning Authority are totake over the  legislative powers of Parliament under this headgenerally,   and not merely where compulsory purchase of landis involved, some logical system would be possible.
          A system which contemplates that the new Sanctioning.Authority shall deal generally with Private Bills, includinglegislative provisions such as are generally found in LocalAuthorities1 Bills, where it happens that the land is to be acquired ccmpulsorily, but refers such Bills to anothertribunal where the land can be acquired by agreement, wouldbp illogical, expensive and indefensible. ,          Anyone dealing with this question must read thememorandum of the Counsel to the Chairman of Committees ofthe House of Lords.  (H.L.Paper (91) of 1918),  So far aspossible the points already dealt with by him in that llemoran-dum have been avoided in this Note,
