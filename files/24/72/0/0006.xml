fTftis Doenment is the Property -of His Britannic Majestys GcfakninenfcJSECRET.POLITICAL INTELLIGENCE DEPARTMENT,          FOREIGN  OFFICE.                     Special I.                                MEMORANDUM     ^iSVJ.                        RESPECTING  &apos; TOE SETTLEMENT OF TURKEY AND THE ARABIAN PENINSULA.              [Maps illustrating this Memorandum issued separately.]     1. THIS  paper is divided into three  parts: (A)  &quot;Commitments,&quot; in which  asummary is given  of  treaties, agreements, and  understandings  at present binding upon His Majesty&apos;s  Government;  (B) &quot; Desiderata,&quot;  in which  the  lines of settlementnecessary or desirable in British interests are sketched out; and (C) &quot; Policy,&quot; in whichsuggestions are put forward for the revision of &quot; commitments&quot; in the direction of&quot; desiderata,&quot; if and when opportunities offer in the course of negotiations.     2. The first part deals mainly  with  questions of fact, the second with aims, and thethird with action, and it has therefore seemed convenient to keep them distinct.     3. The problems of Ottoman finance have been dealt with  separately,&apos;1&apos; and in regardto the questions of Constantinople,  the Black  Sea Straits, the Dodekannese, Cyprus,and  the Italian claims in Anatolia,  reference  should also be made to the series of memoranda dealing with the settlement of Southern and South-Eastern Europe.   * SEE MEMORANDA PRINTED FOR THE TREASURY IN 1916, 1917, AND  1918, AND ANNEXES TO  MEMORANDA DEALING--WITH THE SETTLEMENT OF SOUTHERN AND SOUTH-EASTERN EUROPE (SECTION ON EUROPEAN TURKEY).[D20-11B
(A.)-Part One.   Commitments.     It will be convenient to give, first, a schedule of the principal treaties, agreements;and understandings in which these commitments are embodied,  and  then to analysetheir bearing both in general and in regard to different areas.     Under  the   Anglo-Turkish   Conventions  of  the  29th July,  ID 13,  and the9th March, 1914,  the Arabian Peninsula south and east of a line prolonging the frontier of the Aden Protectorate north-eastward to latitude  20o, and thence running due northto a point on the Arabian coast of the  Persian  Gulf approximately south of BahreinIsland, was recognised as a British sphere.  Nearly all  the independent Arab rulers inthis  area  had  previously entered  into permanent  relations  with  His  Majesty&apos;sGovernment, and  the remainder have done so subsequently.   And since  these relations were altogether in the interests of Great  Britain, and are most  unlikely  to  be  called inquestion by any other Power, it seems superfluous to discuss them in this memorandum.     Our  bipartite agreements with Turkey lapsed with the  war,  and bind neither hernor us unless or until  they are specifically renewed.    Our agreements  with  Russiaregarding the war and the  peace settlement  lapsed either when  there ceased to be a central Russian Government recognised by the Allies, or when the  Bolshevik Govern-ment made peace  with Germany.   This  leaves  the following agreements  to  be takeninto account:      1. &quot; Reglement organique &quot; of the Lebanon vilayet,  dated  June 9, 1861.     2. &quot; Reglement organique &quot; of the  Lebanon vilayet,  dated September 6, 1864.     3. Treaty of Berlin, dated July 13, 1878,  article 61, relative to ameliorations and            reforms in the Ottoman provinces inhabited by Armenians.     4. Proclamation by the Government of India, dated November 2,  1914, regarding            the Moslem  holy places. *     5. Assurance, dated November  3, 1914,  made  by  the British Resident  in the            Persian Gulf to the Sheikh of Koweit.     6. Assurance, dated November 22,  1914,  made by the  British  Resident  in the            Persian Gulf to the Sheikh of Moharamerah.f     7. Treaty, dated April 26, 1915, with Italy.     8. Treaty, dated April 30, 1915, and ratified  November  6,  1915,  with  the Idrisi            Sayyid  of  Sabia  (see Political  Intelligence  Department,  Foreign  Office,            &quot;Special&quot; 4).     9. Understanding with King Husein of the Hejaz.   (Not  embodied  in any single            instrument,   but  see  Political  Intelligence  Department,  Foreign  Office,            &quot; Special&quot; 3.)     10.  Treaty, dated December 26, 1915, and ratified July 18,1916, with Abdul-Aziz            Bin Saud, Amir of Nejd and Al Hasa.     11.  Agreement, dated May 16, 1916, with France.     12.  Agreement, dated August 18, 1917, with Italy.$     13.  Letter, dated November 2,1917, from Mr. Balfour to Lord Rothschild, regarding            Jewish Zionist  aspirations.     14.  Joint Declaration, dated Novemoer 9,  1918,  by His Majesty&apos;s Government and            the French  Government regarding the future  of Syria and Mesopotamia.    * A briefer version of this proclamation was circulated to the Gulf Chiefs on the  3rd November, 1914.    f This  Arab ruler and his tribesmen are nominally Persian subjects and their country Persian territory,and strictly therefore they fall outside the scope of the present memorandum.  But the future of Mohammerahis bound to  be considered in relation to that of Mesopotamia and the Arabian Peninsula.    $ This  agreement was made  (ft) &quot;subject to the consent of Russia,&quot; which has never been given ; and(b) in pursuance of article  9 of  the treaty of the 26th April, 1915 (No. 7 above), which makes it in effectconditional  upon the execution of  the Anglo-French Agreement of the  16th May, 1916, and of  the parallelagreements (now void) which  France and Great Britain made with Russia, this contingent  character beingalso expressly laid down in article 8 of No. 12.    Technically, therefore, No. 12 is invalid, but Great Britain and France  are bound by No. 7 to takeItalian claims into consideration if they ultimately obtain advantages in the Middle East for  themselves.The full text of Article 9 of No. 7 will be found on p. 17 of the present memorandum.
                             I. General Commitment^      (i.) His Majesty&apos;s Government have  not committ. d themselves to  giving up any  of their pre-existing rights, relations, facilities,  or  other interests, political or economic,  in this region  (c.f/., territorial possessions, protectorates, capitulations,  concessions to  British subjects, &amp;c\).      (ii.) They have declared in a general  way  that the non-Turkish populations shall  be liberated from Turkish misrule, and given an  opportunity of national life and economic  development.      (hi.)  They have pledged themselves, in general or specifically, that  the legitimate  interests of the Moslem world, Jewry, the Roman Catholic Church, and  other  interna-  tional bodies in shrines and  holy cities situated in  this region, or in territories in this  region where they have traditional  claims,  shall  not be prejudiced in  the  settlement, or  even that they shall be secured more satisfactorily than hitherto.      They  have also pledged  themselves  to  the satisfaction, if possible, of  specific  desiderata, of their Allies, and  they are morally  bound to take all legitimate  interests  of their Allies into  consideration.  &apos;      (iv.)  They have  entered  into  positive permanent  liabilities,  both   military  and  political, towards certain independent  Arab rulers,  and have assured  the  inhabitants of  certain occupied territories specifically that  they shall not be put back under  Turkish  rule.                        II. Commitments in Different Areas.      (1.) As  regards European Turkey  and Anatolia, His Majesty&apos;s Government are  not pledged to  the extinction of an independent Turkish National State, but they did  provisionally agree (see Schedule, No. 12) that Italy shall establish such direct or  indirect  administration  or control as she desires in the Green Area, and  shall have political and  economic priority in Area C, though the latter  is to form part of an  independent State  (presumably Turkey).   Italian  rights  in the Green Area and Area C are  subject to the  following limitations : Smyrna  is to be  a  free port for British and French trade; the  existing Ottoman customs tariff is to remain  in  force for twenty  years;  and there are to be no internal customs barriers between any of the  u coloured &quot; or  &quot; lettered &quot; areas.      The British-owned Aidin  Railway in the  Green  Area is  protected by a mutual undertaking on the  part of Great Britain, Italy, and France (No.  12) that the interests of each Power in the areas assigned to the  others shall be scrupulously respected.      His Majesty&apos;s Government have not consented to any modification of the Capitula- tion  Treaties in European Turkey or Anatolia, or  in  any other part of the  former territories of  the Ottoman Empire;  but  since  these treaties are bipartite only, they have lapsed with the war and will have to be renewed specifically if their maintenance is desired.      As regards the  control of the Black Sea Straits, His Majesty&apos;s Government are no longer  bound by their  qualified  acceptance of  the Russian circular  telegram of the 4th March, 1915, in which Russia claimed those  portions of the littoral of the Straits which are coloured j^ellow on  the map.  Their hands are now entirely free in regard both to  the control of the Straits and to the disposal of Constantinople.     (2.) As&apos; regards the Dodekannese group of islands, which are still nominally Ottoman territory, but have  been occupied by Italy since 1911, we have pledged ourselves that Italy shall obtain complete sovereignty over them (No.  7, article 8).     As regards Cyprus, we are pledged not  to cede it to any third Power without the previous consent of France (No. 11, article 4.)     (3.) As regards Armenia, we are bound, perhaps juridically  and certainly morally, by  article  61  of  the  Berlin  Treaty  (No.  3), under which  Turkey  is  pledged to &quot;introduce ameliorations  and reforms into the  provinces inhabited  by Armenians.&quot; This article was substituted, at  our instance, for  article  16  of the superseded Treaty of San Stephano, which provided that the Russian troops  should remain in  occupation of these provinces  until  satisfactory reforms  were carried  out.   Turkey  has  actually omitted to carry out her pledge for  forty years, in spite of repeated protests from  His Majesty&apos;s Government, and has added the massacres  of 1895-7, 1909, and 1915 (the worst of all) to her record of misrule.    It is clearly incumbent upon us to put an end to these wrongs  to humanity  andviolations of an international treaty to which we are a party, now that it lies within our power to do  so.
       We are, however, committed  in  regard  to  the south-western half of Armenia  (Sivas, Kharput, Diarbekir, Cilicia)  by its  inclusion in the Blue  Area, where  we have  agreed (No.  11)  that France  shall establish  such  direct  or indirect administration  or  control  as she  desires.0   But we have a  free  hand  in  the Yellow Area, which was  assigned to  russia,  and in those districts west of the  Yellow Area and north of the  Blue  which equitably should  be included in an Armenian State.       We are  also parties to an undertaking, made to Italy by France, that Mersina and  all  other harbours on  the Oilician coast shall  be free ports  for Italian  trade with the  Green Area.       Note. The future of Russian  Armenia will have to be  considered in connection  with  that  of  Turkish Armenia,  but  it falls  outside  the scope of  the  present  memorandum.       (4.) Arab Countries and  Kurdistan.      The Arab countries concerned are the  Arab provinces of  Turkey and the  Indepen-  dent States of  the Arabian  Peninsula the  Aden Protectorate on the  mainland  and  islands,  especially the Protectorate of Bahrein, being excluded.      Our commitments in this area are as follows :       (a.) His Majesty&apos;s Government are parties to  the &quot; Reglements organiques&quot; of the  -Lebanon vilayet (Nos.  1 and 2 in the Schedule).      (5.)  They  have  treaties, agreements,  and  understandings   with the  Sultans  of  Mokalia  and Maskat, Chiefs  of &quot; Trucial Oman,&quot;  Sheikhs of Koweit and Al Katar,  Bin Saud,  the  Idrisi and  other independent  Arab  rulers, and  with  the Sheikh  of  Mohammerah, who is an autonomous ruler under the sovereignty  of Persia.      Some of these commitments are nearly a century  old, others (including the most important) have  been entered into daring the war.  They vary greatly in scope and strictness, as the parties to them  differ in  power and. in the closeness of their contact with  Great Britain; but there  is a standard  &quot; trucial&quot; pattern (see below) to which they more or less approximate.      (c.)  Subject to the maintenance of all the  above obligations and rights, and  so long  as  there is no  detriment  to  the  interests of France, His Majesty&apos;s Government are  pledged  to King  Husein (by  a letter  to him  dated the  24th October, 1915, from the  High Commissioner (Cairo)) that not merely his own  dominions in the Hejaz, but also  the Red and  Brown Areas, the Akka-Haifa  Enclave, Areas  A and B, and the whole  mainland of the  Arabian Peninsula  south of Area B,  with the exception of the Aden  Protectorate, shall  be &quot; Arab &quot; and &quot; Independent.&quot;      We are not committed to the establishment of a unitary State or of a Confederation of  States  in  this area, nor  to  any  suzerainty of King  Husein  outside  the Hejaz. King  Husein  claimed the  boundaries of Arab independence  to which we have assented, not in his own name, but as the  spokesman of the various populations, and our pledge was given to him in this capacity oidy.      Nor  are we committed to him, or to anyone, in regard to the Caliphate.  His Majesty&apos;s Govern-.  ment have consistently maintained that this is a question  to be decided by  the Moslems themselves,  and they  have merely expressed a pious hope that &quot; an Arab of true race will&quot; assume the Caliphate  at Mecca  and Medina.&quot;!      As  a result of agreements with King Husein, other  independent rulers, and our  Allies, we have  obtained  a  special position for ourselves, to the exclusion  of other  outside Powers, in the greater part of the Arab area, with certain  important  exceptions,  which appear when our commitments are analysed province by province.    * Subject to the same limitations regarding&apos; customs tariffs as Italy has agreed to in the Green Area,.and to an undertaking not to cede her rights  (except to the  Arab State  or Confederation!)  without theprevious cousent of Great Britain.  France has also agreed that Alexandretta (which is included  in the BlueArea and should probably be reckoned to Armenia) shall be a free port for British and Italian trade with theEed Area and vVreas A and B.    f Message from Lord Kitchener to Sherif Abdullah, son of King Husein, despatched on the 31st October,1914, the date on which war broke out between Great Britain and Turkey.
          III. Commitments in the different Arab Countries (including Kurdistan).   I.  The Arabian Peninsula, excluding the Hejaz.       (a.)  We  have treaties  with  the independent  rulers  enumerated above (Part  I,   section 4), the standard of which has been set by the series  concluded in the years 1820,   1839, 1853, and 1892 with the &quot; Trucial Chiefs &quot; of the Oman coast.       The fundamental points in a  &quot; trucial treaty &quot; are the following:        (1.) The native Governments agree to keep the peace, and to refer their disputes with one another   to the arbitration of His Majesty&apos;s Government.       (2.) His Majesty&apos;s Government undertake to arbitrate, to enforce their awards, and to watch over   the peace.       (3.) The native Governments undertake to abstain from relations with outside Powers other than   Great Britain, and not to receive representatives of such Powers without His Majesty&apos;s Government^   consent; further, that they will  not alienate or lease territory to any outside Power except  Great   Britain, nor grant concessions to any foreigners except British subjects.       (4.) His Majesty&apos;s Government undertake to protect the native Governments against unprovoked   aggression by outside Powers.       It may be  noted that it has been the practice of His  Majesty&apos;s  Government to  limit their   obligations to the keeping of the peace and defence against unprovoked aggression at sea, but that this   limitation has not been  specified in the treaty  concluded during the war with Bin Saud (No. 10).   This is an important departure from precedent.       Our treaty with the Idrisi (No. 8)  is much looser than the &quot; trucial&quot; kind.  We also made  an  agreement in 1915 with  the Sheikh of  Mavia, who rules a  district  of great strategical importance  immediately beyond the frontier of the Aden Protectorate, but it  has become void through his siding  with the Turks.   We  have no commitments to Imam Yahya of Sanaa (Yemen), or to Bin Eashid,  Amir of Jebel Shammar; and   Bin Piashid&apos;s  recent act  in acknowledging the overlordship  of  King Husein probably precludes  the establishment of direct relations  hereafter between him and  His Majesty&apos;s Government.       (b.) We have pledged ourselves to King  Husein (No. 9) that the whole mainland  of the  peninsula with the exception of  the A den  Protectorate  (within  its  pre-war  limits) shall be &quot; independent&quot; and &quot; Arab &quot; ;  in other words, we have pledged ourselves  to the expulsion  of  the Turks, but in  other  respects  to the  status  quo.  We have  declared further, in a Foreign  Office statement  dated the 11th June, 1918, in  reply to  a memorial from Syrians resident in Egypt, that, &quot; in regard to areas in Arabia which  were free and independent before  the outbreak of  war, and  areas emancipated from  Turkish control by the action  of  the Arabs themselves  during the  present war, His  Majesty&apos;s Government recognise the complete and sovereign independence of the Arabs  inhabiting these areas, and support them in  their struggle for freedom.&quot;       (c.) We are pledged to  France and provisionally to Italy, and they to us (No. 11,  article 10,  and  No.  12, article 7),  that we  &quot;will  not  ourselves  acquire and will not  consent to  a third Power  acquiring  territorial  possessions in the  Arabian Peninsula,  nor  consent to a third Power  installing a naval base either on the east coast, or on the  islands, of the Red Sea.   This, however, shall not prevent such adjustment of the Aden  frontier as may be necessary in consequence  of recent Turkish aggression.&quot;     In subsequent discussions the French Government  have recognised that Great Britain has  &quot; special political interests &quot; in the Arabian Peninsula.     The three Powers are also pledged to consider  measures regarding the arms traffic.  No definite  arrangement has yet been agreed upon, but there have been  discussions between French and British representatives, in which the French proposed to leave it to the discretion of His Majesty&apos;s Government to take the  necessary steps for stopping &quot; any trade capable  of fomenting disturbances, such  as the arms trade, slave trade, &amp;c,&quot; in the  Arabian Peninsula. 2. The Hejaz.      The Hejaz  is  covered by our general commitments to France, Italy, King  Husein, and the Syrian memorialists regarding the  independence of the Arabian Peninsula (see above), and we were pledged specifically that the Holy Places, including Jeddah, should be immune from attack during the war (No. 4).     We have also recognised Husein as an independent ruler with the style and title of &quot;His Lordship the King of the Hejaz.&quot;     Husein, on  his  part, has  never  accepted this  title,  and regards himself as &quot; His Majesty the King of the Arabs &quot; (the  style and  title under which  he was  crowned at Mecca in 1916).   Our  understanding with  him,  in  his capacity of local ruler, amounts to little more than a recognition of independen cand a provisional arrangement  for thejoint conduct of the war.
     The  French Government  have  consented (No. 11, article 11) that  &quot; the negotiations with the Arabs as to the boundaries of the Arab State or Confederation (it,, the negotiations with King Husein) shall be continued through the same channel as before&quot; the Agreement of 1916 (i.c, through His Majesty&apos;s Government), and they have observed ti :s understanding in practice for  instance, in the negotiations regarding King Husein&apos;s title, referred to above.     On the  other hand, there has been a French military  mission at Jeddah and a French Moslem agent  at  Mecca.  And  the  latter  was not only instructed  to  deal  with&apos; the  Hejaz Government regarding pilgrimage facilities for the Moslem subjects  of France (a matter in which His Majesty&apos;s Government could not, and would not desire to, prevent the maintenance  of direct relations  between the Hejaz and other  outside Powers), but was given  written instructions regarding certain purely political questions, which were communicated at the time to His  Majesty&apos;s Government by the French Ambassador.   This has  created an awkward precedent, and  in  subsequent negotiations (which  were not, however, carried  to a conclusion) we virtually admitted  that France  has a status in  the Hejaz which is in some manner an exception to the general political priority of Great Britain in the Arabian Peninsula.     It may be expected, moreover, that Italy will  claim any privileges that are acquired by France. 3.  Mesopotamia (Irak and parts  of Jezireh).     (a.)  His Majesty&apos;s Government are pledged to King Husein that the whole of  this area shall be  &quot;independent&quot;  and &quot;Arab,&quot;  but King Husein  has  consented that Great  Britain shall take &quot;special measures of  administrative  control&quot; in the  former Turkish vilayets of Basra and  Bagdad (together    Irak). , King Husein suggested that this regime should be short, and that he should  be compensated  for it by a contribution from  Mesopotamian   revenues,  but His Majesty&apos;s  Government  have  not  committed themselves to any  such  payment,  nor  to any  limitations on their  control, either of period or function.     As regards those parts of Jezireh which go naturally with Irak  (see below), King Husein  has neither been  asked to concede,  nor  has conceded, any reservations in regard to the independence assented to by us.     (b.)  France and  Italy have  agreed  (No.  11, article 2, and  No. 12, article 1) that Great Britain shall establish such  direct or indirect administration  or control  in  the Red Area as she  desires  and  may think fit  to arrange with  the  Arab  State  or Confederation (see  below), and  that she  shall  have  political and economic priority in Area B (which covers part of Mesopotamia).*    France has also  agreed  to guarantee to Great Britain a &quot; given supply &quot;  of water from the Tigris and Euphrates in Area A for Area B.     His Majesty&apos;s Government on their part  are pledged to France  to recognise and uphold an independent Arab State  or Confederation, under the  suzerainty of an Arab chief,  in Area B ; not to cede their  rights in the Red Area to any third Power, except the Arab State or  Confederation,  without  the previous  consent  of  the   French Government  (No. 11, article 9);  and not to extend  the Bagdad Railway  northwards beyond Samarra, until a railway connecting  Bagdad with Aleppo via the Euphrates valley has been completed.     Further, that in  the Red Area and Area  B the existing Ottoman customs tariff is to  remain in force  for twenty years, and that  there are to  be no internal  customs barriers between any  of the &quot; coloured&quot;  or &quot; lettered &quot; areas.  &apos;  Moreover, those  parts of Jezireh which go naturally with Irak (that is, at least the parts  east of the line Verdi-Jeziret Ibn Omar, including Jebel Sinjar  and Mosul)  are included  in  Area A,  in  which we have agreed that France  shall have political and economic priority, under the same conditions as we in Area B.     (c.)  We are also  pledged  to  the  Sheikh of  Koweit  (No.  5),  the Sheikh   of Mohammerah and Bin Saud, that Basra shall never again be subject to Turkish authority, The same assurance has been given verbally to  the notables  of  Basra vilayet, and the Viceroy of India, in a speech delivered at Basra on the 3rd February, 1915, to  a local deputation, indicated plainly, though not expressly, that Turkish administration  wouldnot be restored.     (d.)  As  regards  the (Shia)  Holy  Cities  in  Mesopotamia, they  were  includedspecifically in the Government  of India&apos;s Proclamation concerning Moslem  Holy Places (No. 4), and in the similar assurance to  the Gulf Chiefs, but reference to them wascarefully avoided in our negotiations with  King  Husein.   Lord  Grey of Fallodon alsoavoided discussion of  their status in his conversation with the Aga Khan on the subject* Including the country of the Amarat-Anazeh tribe, on the Mesopotamian side of the Syrian steppe.
  of the Arab movement and the Caliphate in 1915,*   On the occasion of the occupation  of the  Bagdad district by  the  British forces  in  1917,  His  Majesty&apos;s  Government  informed the Persian Government that the British  military authorities would do all in  their power to protect  the Shia Holy Places.&apos;!&apos;      Our  commitments, written, verbal, or implicit, to the &quot; Mujtahids &quot; and inhabitants of these Holy  Cities since our occupation of Bagdad  vilayet  can only  be reported upon adequately  by the  Chief  Political Officer attached to General Marshall^  Army, and this is also true of our commitments to the  rest of the population  in Mesopotamian occupied territory.      (e.) In reply to a  memorial by Syrians  resident in  Egypt, His  Majesty&apos;s Govern-  ment  declared  on  the 11th June,  1918,  that,  &quot;in areas  formerly under Ottoman  dominion occupied  by  the Allied forces during the present war, it is the  wish and  desire of His Majesty&apos;s Government that the future government should be based upon  the principle of the consent  of  the governed,&quot; and  that &quot; this  policy has and will  continue to have the support of His Majesty&apos;s Government.&quot;  We have since declared jointly with France  (No.  14) that:       &quot; The aim which France and  Great Britain have in view in prosecuting in the East  the war let loose by German ambition is the complete and final liberation of the peoples  so long oppressed by the  Turks, and the establishment  of national  governments and  administrations  deriving their authority from the  initiative  and free choice of the native  populations.      &quot;In order to give effect to these intentions, France and Great Britain have agreed to encourage and assist  the establishment of native governments and administrations in Syria and Mesopotamia  already liberated by the Allies, and in the territories which they are proceeding to liberate, and they have agreed to recognise such governments as soon as they are  effectively established.   So far from desiring to impose  specific institutions upon the populations of these regions, their sole object is to ensure,  by their support and effective assistance, that the governments and  administrations  adopted by these regions of their  own free will shall be exercised in the normal way.   The function which the two Allied Governments claim for themselves  in the liberated territories is to ensure impartial and  equal justice  for  all;  to facilitate  the  economic  development of  the country by encouraging local initiative; to promote  the diffusion  of education; and to put an end to the divisions too long exploited by Turkish policy.&quot; 4.  Kurdistan.     This country may be  defined as the territory  south of  the Bohtan River, and east of the  Tigris and the  Jebel  Hamrin, which has hitherto  belonged to Turkey, and is bounded  on  the east  by  the Persian frontier.     We are pledged to  King Husein that the parts of this territory south  of a line-running west-and-east from Jeziret-ibn-Omar, on the Tigris,  through Amadia to  the Persian frontier, shall be &quot; independent&quot; and &quot;Arab.&quot;     We  are also pledged to  France (No. 11, Article 1) that the same  parts shall beincluded  in the independent Arab  State or Confederation which is to be recognised andupheld by us, and this pledge  has been adhered to provisionally by  Italy (No. 12,Article 1).     It has also been  agreed that in these  parts France shall have political and economicpriority north of a line running up the Lesser Zab River, through Khoi Sanjak to thePersian frontier  and  Great Britain a similar priority south of that line.     We have a free hand in the parts of Kurdistan  north of the Jeziret-Amadia  line,since they were included in the Yellow Area  assigned to  Russia.   These parts contain the  settlements  of the  Nestorian  Christians (Assyrians)  in the upper valley  of theGreater Zab, and we are  under a certain obligation to secure their future, since they were under the auspices of an Anglican Mission before  the war,  and have suffered atrocitiesduring it  at the hands of the Turks and Kurds.    We are thus committed to the partition of Kurdistan into three sections, in the two  largest ofwhich certain rights are secured to ourselves, the  French, and the Arabs, but none to the Kurds.5. Syria (including parts of Jezireh that do not go with Irak).     (a.)  Lebanon: In the protocol signed  at Constantinople on the 6th September, 1864,by the representatives of Turkey,  Austria, France, Great Britain, Prussia, and Russia,* 164776/34982/15.t 60225/55826/17.
 the Ottoman  Government declared, &quot; in  accord with the representatives of the other Powers,&quot; that they maintained all the provisions of the Reglement  organique of the Lebanon, and oi the additional Act, o.&apos;the 9th June, 1861.   The text  of the Reglement, with certain modifications, was attached to the above protocol.      The Reglement defines the boundaries  of the Lebanon  vilayet, provides that  it shall be administered by  a Christian Governor,  calls into being an Administrative Council, and lays down details of local government, justice, finance, and contributions to the Ottoman Treasury.      Since the protocol to which this Reglement is attached is not a mere bipartite agree- ment between Great  Britain and Turkey, it cannot be regarded as having simply lapsed with the war.  His  Majesty&apos;s  Government  are  probably  bound  by it juridically as regards, at  any rate,  the other parties to  it who are at present their Allies, and morally as regards  the inhabitants of  the  Lebanon, in  the sense  that  the  specific rights of autonomy secured to  them under the Reglement ought not  to suffer detriment  through the abolition of  Ottoman suzerainty,&apos;but  ought  to be  secured to  them,  if  they so desire, under  whatever regime  may  be established, in  this and  other adjoining terri- tories which Turkey will  have to cede at the peace.      It may be noted that these  obligations  to  the  Lebanon might be incompatible with the rights that have  been accorded  by His  Majesty&apos;s Government to France in the Blue Area (see below), though  this of course  would depend  upon the  use Erance abos&quot;1 to make of them.     (6.) We are pledged to King Husein that Syria and Syrian Jezireh  east and south of  the  boundary  between  the  Blue Area  and Area A  shall be &quot; independent&quot;  and &quot; Arab,&quot; so  Jong as there is no detriment to  the interests of France.     (c.) In that part of Syria which is covered by the Blue Area  (i.e., in the Blue Area south of the Alexandretta-Killis line) we have agreed that  France shall establish such direct or indirect administration or control as she desires and  may  think fit to  arrange with the Arab State or Confederation, and that  she shall have political and economic priority  in Area A  (which includes the whole of Syrian Jezireh and part  of the  Bedouin country  that depends on Syria).*     The French Government, on their part, are pledged to us to recognise and uphold an independent Arab State or Confederation, under the suzerainty of an Arab  chief, in Area A ; not to cede  their rights in the Blue Area to any third Power, except the Arab State or Confederation, without the previous consent of Great Britain (No. 11, article 9); and not to  extend the Bagdad Railway southwards beyond Mosul, until a  railway connecting Bagdad with Aleppo, via the Euphrates Valley, has been completed.     Further, that, in  the Blue Area and Area A, the existing Ottoman customs tariff is to remain in force for  twenty years, and that there are to be no internal customs barriers between any of the &quot;  coloured &quot; or &quot;&apos; lettered &quot; areas.     Moreover, the  Trans Jordan country,  and part of the Bedouin country that  depends on Syria (that is,  the  districts along  the  Hejaz Railway from Deraa  to Maan,  and the Ruweilah-Anazeh country round  the  Wady  Sirhan), are included in  Area B, in which France has agreed  that His Majesty&apos;s Government shall have political and economic priority,  under the  same conditions  as France in Area A.  Part of the Syrian  Bedouin country,  again, lies south  of Area B, and  is presumably  reckoned to the  Arabian Peninsula, in which the &quot; special political position &quot; of Great Britain has been recognised by France in subsequent discussions (see III,  I above).     Besides this,  France has agreed (No.  11, article 5) that there shall be free  railway transit across the  Blue Area from Alexandretta for British trade with Areas A and B and the Red Area, and that His Majesty&apos;s Government may carry a railway from Haifa to Bagdad (see Palestine below) through Area A.     (d.)  Our statement to the Syrian memorialists and our joint   declaration  with France (No. 14) apply to the future  of Syria  as  well as that of Mesopotamia (see above). 6. Palestine (west of Jordan).     (a.)  We are  pledged  to  King  Husein that  this territory shall  be &quot;Arab&quot;  and &quot; independent.&quot;     (6.)  France (No.  11, Article 4) and  provisionally  Italy (No.  12,  Article 4) have &quot;accorded &quot; the ports of Akka and Haifa  to Great Britain, but His Majesty&apos;s Govern-    * That-is, the countries of the Fedaan Anazeh  (between Horns and the Euphrates), the Sibaa Anazeh(between Damascus and  Der-el-Zor), and a. corner of the Wuld  Ali and  Ruweilah-Anazeh  country, which is .mostly included in Area B and the Peninsula Area south of it,
ment have agreed, on their part, that these ports shall be free for French and  Italiantrade with the Blue Area and Areas A and B.     (c.) France has agreed (No. 11, Article 7) that Great Britain may build, administer,and be sole owner  of a  railway from  Haifa to Bagdc d, and that she  shall have  aperpetual right to transport troops along such a line at all times.     (d.) In the Brown Area,* Great Britain, France (No. 11, Article 3\and provisionallyItaly (No. 12, Article 3) have agreed that an &quot;international administration &quot; shall beestablished, the form, of which shall be decided upon in consultation  with  the other allies and the representatives of King Husein.     (e.) Moslem  Holy Places  in Palestine (i.e.,&apos;the Mosque of Omar, and Abrahaui&apos;sTomb at Hebron, the latter of which is excluded from  the Brown Area) are implicitlyincluded in the Government of India&apos;s proclamation  (No. 4).     (/.) His Majesty&apos;s Government have  conveyed (No. 13) to the Zionist federation the statement that &quot; they view with favour the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish  people, and will  use their  best endeavours to  facilitate  the achievement of this object, it being clearly understood  that nothing shall be done whichmay prejudice  the civil  and  religious rights of existing non-Jewish  communities inPalestine  or the rights and political status enjoyed by  Jews in any other country.&quot;     (g.) The draft proclamation prepared for  General Allenby&apos;s entry into Jerusalemwas  not issued  officially, either on that occasion  or subsequently, but  it  has been published in the English press, and was referred to  in the statement of British policyissued by the Foreign Office on the 11th June, 1918, in  reply to a memorial from Syriansresident in Egypt.

(B.)-Part Two.  Desiderata.                                I. General Desiderata.     (1.) Maintenance of pre-existing British rights, relations, facilities, and other British interests, political and economic, in&apos;this region.     (2.)  A settlement of the whole  of this region (which as lying between Egypt and India is of direct interest to the British Empire) on a stable and friendly basis.     &quot; Stability &quot; means the establishment of an effective Government, or Governments, acceptable  to the populations; &quot; friendliness &quot; means the intention of such Governments neither to  pursue a policy hostile to the British Empire nor to serve  the interests of a third Power pursuing such a policy.     (3.) That in carrying out such  a  settlement  no  arrangements shall be entered into that are  likely to prejudice seriously the good relations of the British Empire with the  Moslem world,  Jewry, the Roman  Catholic Church,  or any other  international body legitimately interested  in the future  of this  region  or in  shrines or holy cities situated in it.                                                   -     A  fortiori, all new arrangements, however desirable in  themselves, are subordinate to the maintenance of good relations with our Allies, so long as our own vital  interests are preserved.     (4.) That, in view of the above  considerations, the desired settlement  shall  be secured with the least possible increase of political and military liabilities for the British Empire.                          II. Desiderata in Different Areas.     (1.)   In  European  Turkey  and  Anatolia  His  Majesty&apos;s  Government  have  no interest in preventing the maintenance of an independent  Turkish  National State, and the substitution of some satisfactory alternative for  the Capitulations in this area; but some effective  safeguard  must be  found  for  the  non-Turkish elements in the population, and especially for the Greeks in Smyrna and  other important centres on the west coast of Anatolia.     With regard to the Black Sea Straits, it is indispensable that they should  be under effective international control;  but His Majesty&apos;s Government are  prepared to discuss the methods by which this control is to be established  and have not  committed them- selves to any particular solution in advance.     With regard to the  future of  Constantinople,  the  establishment  of such control over the Straits would satisfy British  strategical  and  economic  desiderata. But since the  prestige  with  which the  Ottoman   Sultan is  invested  by the  possession  of Constantinople is one of his chief supports in the retention  of the Caliphate, and since the transference of the Caliphate from the Turks  to the Arabs is  distinctly  desirable from the British point of view  (see below), the expulsion of Turkey from Constantinople may perhaps  be regarded as a British desideratum  on political  grounds.   In view, however, of ancient rivalries for the possession of Constantinople, there  are  considerable and, it  may be, convincing objections to this course.     (2.) As regards the Dodekannesc group of islands, it is  desirable that  they should be  accorded to Greece by some friendly arrangement  between the Greek  and Italian Governments,  since they are  purely  Greek in population.  And  as regards Cyprus, it would be  well that His Majesty&apos;s Government  should recover freedom to offer it if they desire,  and if that is the desire of the inhabitants, to Greece.     (3.) In Armenia, it is desirable to establish an independent State  that would secure equal justice  for  all religions  and  nationalities;  this  State  eventually  to  be  self- governing, but to be reconstructed for a term  of years by a third  Power; this Power to be  friendly to Great Britain, and to be capable  of building  up Armenia  into an effective barrier  against Pan-Turanianism, and also against the aggression of foreign Powers in  the  direction of the Arab  countries.    Por the reconstruction of Armenia by an outside Power  to  be effective, Armenia would need a coast-line on the Mediterranean  from which access to the interior would be feasible. So long  as equality  for all elements in the population  is  secured, it is desirable that Armenia  should  be given a, wide extension in the direction of Anatolia,  and that the frontiers of the latter  country  should  be confined to districts where the Turks undoubtedly constitute the bulk  of the population.
       (4.) Arab Countries (as enumerated in Part One, Section (4)) and Kurdistan:        (a.) Subject  to  the  maintenance  of  existing  British  interests and  obligations  (&quot; Reglements organiques &quot; of the  Lebanon  Vilayet,  Aden  and Bahrein protectorates,  possible enlargement of Aden protectorate (see article 10 of No. 1 1:  Anglo-French Agree-  ment of the 10th May, 1916) and treaties with Sultans of Mokalla and Maskat, Chiefs of  &quot;Trucial Oman,&quot; Sheikhs of Koweit, Mohammerah,  and Al Katar,  Bin Saud, the Idrisi,  &amp;c), that the Arab countries should, as  far  as possible, be independent  under effective  Governments, acceptable to the British Empire, and at peace with one another and with  outside Powers.      The federation of  the independent Arab States is a question for the Arabs  themselves.   It  is a  British desideratum in no far as the establishment of a united independent Arab Power (even though  merely nominal) might counteract any odium we may incur  with Moslem  opinion as the chief agents  in the overthrow of the Ottoman Empire (the sole remaining representative of Islamic power  and  independence before the war).  On the other hand, this rather imponderable advantage would  have to  be balanced against the possible detriment to the peacefuhiess and effectiveness of the independent  Governments which a premature attempt at federation  might involve.  And Great Britain could not  allow a precarious federal scheme to prejudice the &quot; trncial&quot; relations between  herself and  various  independent Arab rulers, by which the peace is effectively kept already over a considerable part of the  Arabian peninsula.  jSTor could she admit that the establishment of a  federation  should  prevent the  extension of &quot;trucial&quot; relations to other local Arab  Governments with which she is not yet in treaty  relationship, if such extension appeared  necessary for  the  effective  maintenance of peace over  the  whole Arab area.      The reassumptiou  of  the Caliphate by an Arab  house is a question for the Arabs  to settle with  other Moslems, and His Majesty&apos;s Government can take no  open initiative in  the  matter.   At  the same time, it is desirable from the British point of view that the Caliphate should be  transferred by a consensus of Moslem opinion from the Turks to the Arabs.  The  only other British  desideratum in regard to it is that it should be kept distinct  from  the questions  of Arab independence and Arab federation, discussed above.      (b.) In  the independent Arab countries,  whether federated  or not, it  is a British desideratum that  there should be  the  least  possible  intervention,  both in  internal administration and in inter-State relations,  by outside Powers.      But where outside intervention is necessary as, for example, in  the administration of Syria, Irak, and  Jezireh, and  in the relations between Arab  Governments involving questions of tribal allegiance  or the demarcation of boundaries (i.e., questions calculated to disturb  the peace) it is desirable that, except in Syria, where the question must be left open for the moment, this  intervention should as far  as  possible  be the  monopoly of the British Empire.     The grounds of this claim are as follows: The peace of  the Arab countries  is a vital interest of the British Empire; it  can only be maintained  by a trucial system; a  trucial system to be effective must be in the hauds of a single Power, since, if the responsibility is divided, the local rulers who  are to be kept in order will attempt to maintain anarchy by playing off one mediator against the  other; and if this position is to be a monopoly, Great Britain has an overwhelming claim to it  as the Power with  the greatest interests in this  area and the  neighbourhood, and  as  the  only Power which has established a trucial system in any part of Arabia hitherto.     On the other hand, this claim to a special political position in the Arab countries does not imply a similar economic claim in the same area.  His Majesty&apos;s Government  will continue to take  all legitimate official action for preserving and increasing British trade  and  concessions in  their Arabian territories and protectorates, and in the independent Arab countries, but they  do  not aim at securing a paramount economic position in  the  whole of this area by means of a political monopoly.      British desiderata in the Arab countries may be summed up as  a British  Monroe Doctrine for Arabia, but with certain qualifications, which  appear when these desiderata are analysed province by province.         III.&apos; Desiderata in the different Arab Countries (including Kurdistan). 1. The Arabian Peninsula, excluding the Hejaz.     Independence  for  all  effective local Governments, and  the  conclusion  of treaties, on the &quot; trucial pattern &quot;  (see Part One,  Section III), with all that  have .not already made treaties or agreements with Great Britain.    It is to be noted that the rulers with whom His  Majesty&apos;s Government had treaties  before  the war were nearly all coastal chiefs, with no hinterland except the uninhabited south-eastern desert, and therefore without suzerainty over Bedouin tribes.  Their subjects lived by pearl fishing and  coastal trade, and breaches of the peace on their part generally occurred at sea.    His Majesty&apos;s Government therefore made it their practice to limit  their  rights  and obligations,under these treaties, to  the keeping of the peace at sea.    On the other hand, the rulers&quot; with whom His Majesty&apos;s Government have made treaties duringthe war, are mostly chiefs of inland tribes and oases, drawing their power from the interior  and  apt tq         /           A
 break the peace over questions of demarcation and tribal allegiance, over which sea-power gives us no control.     If we undertake to keep the  peace throughout the Peninsula, we must therefore be prepared, in the last resort, to intervene directly on land, not oidy in case of  aggression by outside Powers, but for the enforcement of our awards between the Arab rulers themselves.     This problem has already been raised by our Treaty with Bin  Saud, and by the difficulties that have arisen in the interior between him and King Husein. 2. The Hejaz.      It is extremely desirable that the Hejaz  Government  should accept a treaty  with His Majesty&apos;s Government   embodying  an   arbitration   clause,  since,  if  any  one Government  in  the  Peninsula  remains outside the trucial system,  the effectiveness of the whole system is endangered.     On the  other hand, Great  Britain  would  find it difficult to apply the same  sanctions as in  other  parts  of  the Peninsula,  since  any  landing of  troops in  the  Hejaz,  or  even  a blockade  of the coast (especially  in  the pilgrimage season) would excite Moslem  feeling against us everywhere; and a treaty giving us the right to do this would be regarded as a betrayal of independence on the part of any ruler of the Hejaz who concluded it.     As regards the renunciation of relations with any outside Power except His Majesty&apos;s Government, there would be less occasion for a clause providing  against alienations of territory or  concessions, since the  ruler  of the Hejaz would  be  debarred from alienating any of the sacred territory to a non-Moslem Power.by Moslem opinion, and concessions to foreign subjects, even if they were operated through Moslem employees, would also  be very  unpopular (though the  case might arise  if  other districts, e.g., Maan, Akaba, Kunfida, were added to his direct  dominions).  Our main object might be obtained by a clause debarring the  ruler of  the Hejaz from leasing or alienating  the sacred territory to  any Power whatever, without that  exception in favour of ourselves  which,  in  the case of the Hejaz, would be offensive to Moslem opinion.  But the question of concessions is more difficult, since public works will be  needed in the Hejaz, and demanded  by the inhabitants, which it will be impossible to carry out without foreign participation.     The elimination of  all political  relations  with  outside Powers except through His Majesty&apos;s Government is of  course entirely out of the question in the case  of the  Hejaz.  This element in  a trucial treaty  can only be reconciled  with independence in cases  in  which the external relations of  the  local Government  contracting are in  fact  almost exclusively with  the British  Empire. But in the  Hejaz  the  presence of the Holy  Cities, and  the  annual pilgrimage to them,  creates relations of the highest  importance  between  the Hejaz  Government and every Power  in  the world  which has Moslem  subjects.  The fact of  these relations constantly puts  the independence of the Hejaz to the test,  and an attempt by  Great Britain to become a recognised intermediary in these&apos; relations would not be tolerated by other  Powers, or  by the Islamic  world, even if the ruler of the Hejaz  were  willing to  countenance  it  himself.   On the  other  hand, it  would be unfortunate if  His  Majesty&apos;s Governments special trucial  rights were to be confined to relations between the ruler of the Hejaz and his Arab neighbours, and we should aim rather at  obtaining a clear recognition from other outside Powers that their direct relations with the Hejaz should extend to questions affecting the Pilgrimage, and  to these alone.     In the Plejaz, then,  /British desiderata  seem to be  limited to the  conclusion of a &quot; trucial treaty &quot; on a restricted basis, and for  the maintenance of predominant influence we have to depend in part upon our present relations with  King  Husein, our position in Egypt and the Red  Sea, and  the relations  we hope to  establish with  the surrounding- Arab countries. 3. Mesopotamia (Irak and  parts of Jezireh).     In this  country the backward state of  the population,  its  religious  and  social disunity and past misgovernment, combined with the potential resources of the country, their present neglect, and  the great undertakings necessary to  develop  them, make a. &quot; trucial &quot; system inadequate,  and necessitate  the conduct of internal administration by a  foreign  Power at any rate, for  a transitional period,  the  duration  of which  it  is impossible to define.     It is a British desideratum that this should devolve, to the  exclusion of all other Powers, upon  Great  Britain.   And since  the necessity is as great in  Jezireh as in Irak, and parts of Jezireh  are  geographically hardly separable from Irak, it is a British desideratum  that British administration in Mesopotamia should extend to such parts of Jezireh also.     On the other hand,  His Majesty&apos;s Government have stated that they do not desire to annex Mesopotamia, partly because they  do not wish  to commit themselves before- hand  to  permanent  political   and military  liabilities  of such  wade  scope, and  partly because they are  anxious  to  give play to the Arab  national revival when&apos;and where itis accompanied by the capacity to realise itself in an effective way.
       His Majesty&apos;s Government therefore desire to  administer Mesopotamia  for  an   indefinite period as mandatories of the Arabs, which may be  done in several  different   ways:        (a.)  As mandatories  of the local population (a metnod which  might involve the              rather  objectionable sham of a titular local sovereign).       (b.)  As mandatories of the head  of an Arab Federation, if such were to be formed              (a  method which would avoid the embarrassments of (a), since the head of              the Federation would presumably be the local sovereign  of the Hejaz, and              would  not be seated in the administered  provinces).       (c.) A  possible compromise between the above alternatives would be the  appoint-              ment of one of King Husein&apos;s  sons as local ruler  of Mesopotamia, with              British administrative assistance.  It is  understood  that Sherif Abdullah              may be a candidate for this office.  4. Kurdistan (within the boundaries specified above in Part  One,  III, 4).       The Power paramount in this country will command the strategic  approaches to  Mesopotamia and control the water supply of the eastern affluents of the Tigris, on  which the irrigation of Mesopotamia largely depends.   It is  therefore essential  that the  paramount Power in Kurdistan  and Mesopotamia should be  the same ; in other words,  that Great Britain  should  have an  exclusive position in Kurdistan  as  opposed to any  other outside Power.      At the same  time, the arguments against annexation apply even more strongly to Kurdistan than  to Mesopotamia.  It is desirable that the county should form  an independent confederation of  tribes  and towns, and that His Majesty&apos;s Government should  assume  functions intermediate between the  administrative assistance, amounting to direct responsibility for the conduct of government, which they  intend to undertake in Mesopotamia,  and the mere control of external  relations, to which they propose  to limit themselves in the case of the independent rulers of the Arabian  Peninsula.  In  the hills  British control should be exerted with  the least direct intervention possible.  In the  lowlands  bordering on Mesopotamia, where there are important oil-fields and other natural resources,  it may  have to approximate to the Mesopotamian pattern.      The  Nestorian settlements in  the upper valley of the Greater Zab,  where the  Kurds,  under  Turkish  instigation, have  worked  havoc  during  the  war,  should  be formed into an autonomous  enclave, under the  Government  of the Nestorian  Prince-Patriarch, with  a constitution modelled on  that of the Lebanon the necessary  outside assistance to be given by Great Britain..  5. Syria (including  parts of Jezireh not assigned to Mesopotamia).      His Majesty&apos;s Government have less  direct  political interest in  Syria than in any  other of the Arab  countries.&apos; So  far as its  internal  affairs are concerned, they merely  desire that  it  shall be independent  under  an  effective Government friendly to the  British Empire.  But  the inhabitants of the Lebanon vilayet, who as  Ottoman subjects  enjoyed  administrative autonomy  under guarantee of the  Powers,  ought not to be forced into any relation with the rest of Syria of which they do not approve.      Syria is  more capable than other Arab countries of providing such  a Government for itself  on  European lines.  But  if foreign assistance is needed in the internal administration (and  it  will  in  any case be needed to a lesser degree and for a  shorter time than  in  Mesopotamia), His Majesty&apos;s Government are  content, as in the  case of Armenia,  to  see  this assistance given  by  a friendly  Power  on the  invitation  of the native inhabitants.  This disinterestedness in the  internal  affairs of Syria, however, does  not  hold if the  conduct of them is found to  affect prejudicially  the  relations between  Syria  and other  Arab  countries in  which  Great Britain is interested  particularly Mesopotamia, the Ruweilah-Anazeh  country (through  which  a  British railway from  Haifa to Irak would run),  and the Hejaz :       (a.) Economic  relations:  Alexandretta  is  the natural  Mediterranean  port for Jezireh, and Tripoli might become so for Irak, while Damascus is the focus of trade for a large part  of  the  Ruweilah-Anazeh  country, Jebel Shammar, and Hejaz.   It  is a British desideratum that there should  be free  transit  across Syria between these ports and  centres and their hinterlands.     (6.) Political relations: Syria has an open  frontier towards  the desert,  and is therefore  bound  to be involved in the demarcation and  allegiance  controversies  of the Arabian  Peninsula.  &quot;Whether Syria be  self-governing or  assisted  in  her internal administration by a  foreign  Power other than Great Britain, it seems important, for the reasons advanced above in the case of the Hejaz, that the &quot; trucial&quot; relations of thoset
  independent Peninsula rulers  whose sp1&apos; ores border upon Syria should be so arranged as  to preclude  the possibility of a  Power which gave administrative assistance to  Syria  interfering in purely Peninsula affairs.      The interaction of tribal politics throughout the Arab countries has been put forcibly in a memo-  randum of the 20th January, 1.917, by Sir Arthur Hirtzel:-*      &quot;No part of Arabia can be completely indifferent to Great Britain, which is the only Power that  at present has a foothold in the country.  Our bold is limited to a narrow fringe along the coast  . .  .;  its security depends ultimately upon the tranquillity of the interior.  Since we are unable to intervene  in or control the interior, it is essential to exclude all possible seeds of disturbance.      &quot; Arabia is not a State in any effective sense, but a fortuitous concourse of tribes ....  under  chiefs, the limits of whose sway are determined not by frontiers, but by the  tribes which they for the  time  being control.  Their polities are closely  interwoven,  and  a quarrel may run right aeross thr-  contincut.&quot;      These considerations were  embodied in a memorandum of the 29th August, 1917, on French and  British interests in the Arabian Peninsula by Lord E. Cecil  : f      &quot; There exists no more fruitful source of trouble in these semi-civilised countries than  a condition  of things in which tribal combinations can entertain the hope of enlisting one European Power against  another.....      &quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government are convinced that the avoidance of internal strife in Arabia can only  be secured through the retention by Great Britain of the influence which this country has so long held  throughout the Peninsula as the European Power most closely concerned with the internal peace and  external politics of Arabia.&quot;     These principles clearly apply  to Syria, in so far as her open  frontier on the east and south-east  makes her a party to the tribal politics of the Peninsula; and this is the point at which the question  of French administration in Syria touches vital British  interests.  6. Palestine^(including safe  and Hebron, but excluding Akaba  and the country  east      of Jordan).      British  desiderata may be analysed as follows :       (a.)  Strategic : Palestine  adjoins the Sinai Peninsula, the Suez Canal, and Akaba,  and  a British  railway from Akka-Haifa to Irak would  traverse  Palestine in its  first  section.   It is therefore a British desideratum that if the effective government of Palestine  demands the intervention of a single  outside Power in its administration, that Power should be either Great  Britain or, failing that, the United States.  An international administration would not, perhaps, have the same drawbacks as a single foreign (even though  friendly)  administering  Power,  but   it  may be doubted whether  it would secure the political  desiderata set out below.      (6.) Political:  In view of the interests, often  conflicting, of  several international religious  communities in Palestinian holy  places, it  is a British desideratum that there should be an  administration capable of conciliating these interests, and this for  two reasons:  (l) To  ensure  orderly government in  a  country where  disorder would react upon neighbouring countries in which Great Britain is  interested ; and (2) to prevent the possibility of any  of  the international bodies interested in Palestine feeling resent- ment against  Great  Britain as a  party to an  arrangement  there which they might consider unfair to themselves.     In particular,  His Majesty&apos;s  Government  desire to insure  reasonable  facilities in Palestine for Jewish  colonisation, without giving Arab  or general Moslem  opinion an opportunity for considering  that Great  Britain has  been instrumental  in handing over free Arab or  Moslem soil to  aliens.     From this point of view it is desirable that  Palestine, whatever  its  administration and  whatever the  facilities granted to non-Arab  elements in  its population,  should nominally be  included in an Arab Confederation; so that in  Palestine, as well as in Mesopotamia, the establishment  of such  a  confederation  is from one point of view a British interest.     (c.) Economic:  It is a British desideratum that there should be  free transit across Palestine  betAveen Akka-Haifa  and the Anazeh country, the Hejaz, Jebel  Shammar, and Irak.     (d.) Trucial:  In this one respect British desiderata in Palestine are less  exacting than  in Syria.  The frontiers of Palestine  specified above would lie entirely in settledterritory,  and a Palestinian Government would not  therefore  be involved in perpetual demarcation and allegiance  disputes with its neighbours.   A  trucial treaty  with GreatBritain for the settlement of disputes with  adjoining Arab States might therefore be* Foreign Office/132784/93808/1917.f Foreign Office/165801/93808/1917.
 dispensed with, but  this would no longer be the  case  if the  area of Palestine were extended to the east and south.     This raises the question of the future frontier betweei. Palestine and Egypt,   On the one hand, it seems desirable that, all cultivated or cultivable land  on the southern borders of Palestine,  in the neighbourhood of Gaza, Rafa, and Beersheba, should go to Palestine.  But,  on the other hand, it would be preferable,  for the reasons suggested above, that the  Palestinian State should not have jurisdiction over  Bedouin tribes. The tribes south  of the Rafa-Beerslieba line and west of the Wady Arabah go naturally with those of the Sinai Peninsula, and the pre-war frontier between Turkey and Egypt, which separated  them, was a quite arbitrary line.     It might  be  desirable,  therefore,  to  attach  this  triangle of formerly Turkish territory  to  Egypt.   But the  consent  of the  inhabitants  would  have  first  to  be manifested in some clear form, in order to preclude any possibility of misinterpretat  on For, since Egypt is a British Protectorate,  the  attachment of  these tribes to Egyptmight otherwise be represented  as an annexation of free Arabs to the British Empire.                                  IV. Summary.     (i.) European  Turkey and  Anatolia: Sovereign  independence  (the balance  of           advantage, as regards Constantinople, remaining in doubt).    (ii.) Black Sea Straits :  Effective international control.   (hi.) Dodekannese: Friendly settlement between Italy and Greece.   (iv.) Cyprus:  A free hand for ourselves.    (v.) Armenia:  Independence,  with   equal  rights  for all nationalities, and with           assistance of an outside Power for a term of years.   (vi.) Arab  Countries  in  General:  Maintenance of existing  British  possessions,           protectorates, and treaties; widest local independence compatible with this ;           widest  extension of  British  trucial system to independent Arab States;           least possible interference of outside Powers in local internal administration.   (vii.) Arab Federation: Desirable, but without prejudice to (vi).  (viii.) Caliphate: To be settled by the Moslems themselves.   (ix.) Arabian  Peninsula, excluding   Hejaz&apos;:  British trucial  treaties  with  all           independent States.   (x.) Hejaz: Independence;  British  trucial  treaty  to cover all foreign  relations           except those involved in the pilgrimage.   (xi.) Mesopotamia: Independence, with British administrative assistance (subject to           no limitations of period or function).  (xii.) Kurdistan: Same desiderata as in Mesopotamia.  (xiii.) Syria: Independence, with outside administrative assistance if necessary; free           transit  for  trade  between  Syrian  ports  and hinterland; independent           Peninsula rulers whose  spheres  border on Syria, to have  trucial treaties           with Great Britain. (xiv.) Palestine: Independence; administrative assistance to  be either American or           preferably British ;  free transit for trade between Palestinian ports  and           hinterland ; British trucial treaty only  in case Palestine includes  country           east of Jordan.
(0.)-Part  Three.   Policy.                                 I. General  Lines,     1.  It would appear from the survey given in Parts One and Two above that the greatest discrepancies between British  commitments  and desiderata  are  those which arise out of the claims of Italy in Anatolia and of France in Syria and  Jezireh.     2.  The  entry of Italy into  the Green  Area and Area C would  be  bitterly and justifiably opposed by the inhabitants.  The  majority are Turks,  there is an important Greek minority, and most nationalities of the Levant are  represented  at Smyrna; but the Italian colony is only one among many, the Italians have no traditional claim and no vested interests, and there is nothing to show that they are capable of looking after the country.  On the contrary, their record in colonial enterprises elsewhere indicates that  they  would be oppressive  and incompetent.  The  population   would probably oppose Italian intervention  on the plea  of self-determination, and are  quite  capable  of&quot;driving them into the sea, or at any rate confining them to a few  strategical points on the coast.   As parties to the Italian  claim we, and the other  Allies, would suffer the greatest moral damage from such  a situation,  and the results  of Italian  reverses  in Tripoli have shown how dangerously the Pan-Islamic  movement would be fostered by a similar reaction against an  invader on the part of the Turks in  Anatolia.   It  may be added that Great Britain has important material stakes in the Green Area in the shape of the Smyrna trade and the  Aidin Railway (the  only railway enterprise  in  Turkey which has paid its own way).  In spite  of Italy&apos;s  undertakings  under the Agreement (No.  12, see  above), it is practically certain that, if the Italians came on the scene, the Aidin Railway as a British enterprise would be  doomed.     3. In Syria (leaving the Lebanon vilayet on one side)  the difficulty regarding the French claims is equally serious.   The French are  not wanted by the Arabs, the Arabs have  established an  effective administration there, not only in  the four Syrian towns (Damascus, Horns, Hama, Aleppo) assigned to  Area A, but in  considerable portions  of the  Blue Area for instance, the  Anti-Lebanon  district   and  Latakia.  It is fairly clear  that they would resist  the imposition upon them of any foreign &quot; assistance&quot; which they did not ask for themselves, and the idea of French assistance is obnoxious tothem.     As regards British interests, they are much more directly affected  by our pledges  toFrance in this region than by our provisional pledges in Anatolia to Italy.  Area A includespart of Kurdistan  and Jezireh, and these  territories--at  least as far west as a linedrawn across Jezireh roughly from Jeziret-Ibn-Omar on  the  Tigris  to Verdi  on theEuphrates go naturally with Lower Mesopotamia, and are perhaps  essential  for theirrigation and  general development  of that country.  Again,  the boundary betweenAreas A and B separates the settled country east of Jordan (between Deraa and Maan)from  Syria, though the population on either side is inseparable  in social relations andpolitical sympathy.   And it also partitions into  three arbitrary  sections the country  of the  Ruweilah-Anazeh tribe, whose Chief, Nufi  Shaalan, is one  of the most powerfulindependent  rulers in Arabia.  If the line between Areas A and B were to be maintained,we should  have  the  choice between carrying out  this arbitrary partition (a solution which it  would probably be impossible to  enforce)  or  allowing Trans-Jordania and theRuweilah country to  realise their natural destiny  and gravitate towards  Syria.   Thelatter solution is indeed bound to  come to pass, but  if this were combined with the enforcement  of French claims under the Agreement, the result would be to carry  Frenchinfluence into the heart of the Arabian peninsula, and  to give France such a footing  inall  tribal  disputes  concerning  demarcation   and  allegiance  as  would  make theestablishment of a British &quot; trucial&quot; system in Arabia impossible.     4. It seems most desirable, therefore, that we should attempt, at least in these two cases&apos;, to obtain a thorough  revision of the Agreements as they stand, and this leads onto a  consideration  of any   contingent  elements there may  be  in the text  of the documents.     In the Agreement with France (No. 11)  there is nothing contingent at all,  but theAgreements with Italy (Nos. 7 and 12)  both  contain contingent clauses.  Moreover,  inthe latter agreement^ (No. 12) the contingent  clause refers not  merely to  the  Italianclaims but  to  the  whole series  of Agreements  regarding Turkey,  and  France,  insubscribing to the document in which this clause  is contained, would appear to have   * It is assumed in the following&apos; paragraphs,  for the purposes of argument, that No. 12 is valid. Butif its validity is not recognised (see footnote on p. 2 above), then  the contingent clause in it falls to theground like the other articles, and article 9 of No. 7 alone has to be taken into account in this connection.
  admitted thereby that the  clause applies retrospectively to  the  earlier Agreement  between her and Great Britain (No. 11).      5. In the two  Agreements with Italy  the following contingencies were provided  for:   ill. \ Total or  Partial Partition of Turkey.          &quot; In a general way France, Great Britain (and Russia) recognise that Italy is      interested in the balance of power in the Mediterranean, and that,  in case of the      total or partial  partition of Asiatic Turkey, she ought to obtain an equitable share      in the Mediterranean region adjoining  the&apos; province of Adalia,  where  Italy has      already acquired  rights and interests which  have been dealt  with in an Anglo-      Italian Convention.   The zone which will  eventually be attributed to Italy will be      delimited, when the time comes, with consideration for the  existing interests of      France and Great Britain.&quot;  (No. 7, Article 9.)      This article  came  into operation  with  the  conclusion  of the  Anglo-French Agreement  (No.  11), and  was  duly carried  out  in  a  second  Agreement  with Italy (No.  12). (b.)  The incomplete  realisation  of arrangements  provided for  in the several  Agree-        ments concerning  Turkey.          &quot; The  interests of Italy have equally  to be taken into consideration in case -      modifications  are made in the  zones  of interest of  the  Powers.&quot;   (No.  7,      Article  9.)      This was duly taken into account in the  second Agreement:           &quot;It  is understood  that, if  at  the  conclusion of peace  the  advantages      contemplated in the  agreements  made between the Allied  Powers regarding the      attribution to each of them of a  part of the Ottoman Empire  cannot be secured      in their entirety to one  or  more  of the said Powers, then in  any alteration or      arrangement  of the provinces of the  Ottoman  Empire  which takes  place at     the conclusion of the war,  the  maintenance of  the balance of power in the     Mediterranean shall receive equitable consideration in conformity with Article 9     of the Agreement of London, dated the 26th April,  1915.&quot;   (No. 12, Article 8.) (c.) Maintenance of  the territorial integrity  of  the Ottoman Empire.         &quot;The interests  of  Italy shall equally be taken into consideration in  case     the  territorial  integrity  of the  Ottoman   Empire  is  maintained.&quot;  (No. 7,     Article 9.)     6.  Of these three contingencies (c)  (the  maintenance  of Turkish  integrity)  is already ruled  out,  and (a) (the total  or   partial partition  of  the  Ottoman Empire among  the Allied Powers) is an anachronism.     The falling  out  of  Russia, the  intervention  of  America,  and  the general development of  the  international situation have  made the principles of nationality and  democracy  and  the  right of self-determination,  in  which these principles are translated into action,  not merely one element among  others in  the aims of  the Allies, but the essential aim and expression of their cause. &apos;  .  This general development has profoundly  affected the local situation in  the Middle East,  and  the  native  peoples themselves Arabs,   Armenians, Jewish  colonists,, Nestorians, and latterly also the  Greeks who in  the earlier stages of the war,  and during  the greater part of the  period  during which the Agreements were made, were contributing comparatively little towards their own liberation have taken a constantly greater part, while the Allied Powers, with the single exception of  Great Britain, have shouldered less and less of the burden of war against Turkey. (Russia has fallen out altogether, France  has contributed practically  nothing since the Dardanelles, Italy nothing at all at  any  stage.)   Under these circumstances the only conceivable  satisfac- tory settlement of the countries formerly subjected to Turkey lies along the lines  of thejoint declaration recently made by  the   French  Government  and  His Majesty&apos;s Government.    The  liberated  peoples  of  Turkey  are  bound  to  have  &quot;national Governments and administrations, deriving their authority from the initiative and freechoice of the native populations.&quot;  Outside Powers  cannot impose  specific  institutions
 upon the populations of these regions, and will have to limit themselves to &quot;ensuring by their support and effective assistance that the  Governments  and  administrations adopted by these regions of their own free  vill shall be exercised in a normal way.&quot;     Tn other words, the peoples must be free to  form what  political  groupings  they choose, to establish what  Governments they  choose within  these groupings,  and  to invite whatever outside Power they  choose  to assist them, without their  freedom of choice  being hampered by dictation or compulsion at any point.     This being established, it will be convenient to consider the situation  with  regard to contingency (6), which  was that the arrangements agreed upon  among the Allies might  have to be altered or only realised in  part.   This contingency has, in fact,  been brought into operation by the changes in the situation  discussed above, and it  is  now incumbent upon His Majesty&apos;s Government to  give  &quot;equitable  consideration  to the maintenance of the balance of power in the Mediterranean &quot;  in whatever &quot; alteration or arrangement of the provinces of the  Ottoman Empire&quot; will result,  under the  new order of things, from the war.     It is, indeed, almost certain that this new order in Turkey will itself automatically maintain the balance of power in the Mediterranean  as  between the  Allies.  For, in place of the Ottoman Empire, as it existed before the war, there will arise no French, Italian, or British dominions or protectorates assigned to each Power on some ratio, whether equitable or not, but entirely new  and  independent national States, and the frontiers of the Allied Powers towards Turkey will remain where they stood under the status  quo.*   Some, or even  all,  of these  new  States will no doubt desire  foreign assistance for setting them on their feet, and  will  be  at  liberty to ask for the good offices of whatever Power they choose ;  but,  in accepting such an invitation, the  Power which is freely chosen will in no sense be obtaining any of the  &quot;advantages&quot; mutually agreed  upon in the various treaties, even though  that Power is invited voluntarily by the inhabitants of an area which had been  pledged to it  under the  Agreements  over the inhabitants&apos; heads.   The choice will be theirs, not ours, and we  cannot be respon- sible for maintaining the balance of power where it is affected by  action  other than our own.     7.  The above considerations suggest a line of policy which might betaken, in  regard to French and  Italian  claims, by  His  Majesty&apos;s Government.   Our Allies cannot  in principle contest that the populations of Turkey,  including the Turks themselves, are to constitute their own Governments, as this is specifically  accepted  in the  joint Anglo- French Declaration, from which Italy cannot dissent.   Nor-are  any of  them likely  to propose that the new independent national States shall be left severely to themselves in case  they ask for foreign assistance.   It seems  to follow inevitably that there should not only be freedom for the Arabs, Turks, Armenians, &amp;c,  to invite  what Power they like, but that the  various  Powers  should be free towards each other  to  accept such invitations.   Any private arrangements  among the  Powers  by which some  agreed  to refuse invitations of assistance for the benefit of others, would  obviously  be simply a roundabout method of imposing  those  very restrictions   on the liberties  of the  new States which we are professing to rule out.    At the same time,  we  are bound in loyalty to take  the  balance  of  power  into equitable consideration in any manner which the new  circumstances  may  permit,  and we can  at least make sure that, in /the areas  allocated to each Power  under  therAgree- nients, that Power shall have the fullest  opportunity for obtaining the suffrages of the inhabitants, and shall have no impediment placed in its way by the other Powers.  We should do well, however, to make it clear from the outset that we cannot either practise or countenance any form of coercion,  and that, as  we shall not exert pressure upon  the inhabitants of the  areas originally  assigned to us  to opt for our assistance, so also we shall not consider ourselves debarred  from accepting an invitation from the  inhabitants of other areas, if they genuinely and spontaneously turn to us.    The upshot, then, is  this.   The  contingency calling for a  revision of  the Agree- ments has in  fact  arisen owing to the general consensus  that  the peoples of Turkey must determine their destinies themselves, and by the terms of our pact we are  bound to give  equitable consideration  to the maintenance of the balance of power in adapting the Agreements to the new circumstances.    We propose to  do so by preserving equality of opportunity for the several Allies to secure, by the free  choice of the inhabitants  of their respective areas, such part of the rights accorded  to them in these areas under the    * This applies only to the balance of power in respect of Turkey, since, when  the whole Mediterranean is taken  into account, Italy&apos;s gains in the Adriatic will upset the balance  to her advantage and to the.disadvantage of Great Britain and France.
  Agreements as is compatible with the  liberties of the inhabitants laid down in the  Joint Anglo-French Declaration  of November 1918.       These suggestions are  put forward tentatively, but there is  a genuine case for  revision, and these are lines on which we might be able to present  it  without placing  ourselves at any stage in a false position.       Proposals in detail for the different regions are given in Section II below.                                     II.-Detail.  (i.) European Turkey and Anatolia.      (a.) Constantinople.- -From  the point of view of British interests, the arguments  for and tigainst leaving   Constantinople under  Turkish sovereignty are very evenly  balanced.  Against leaving it is  the fact that its retention might enable the Ottoman  Sultan to retain the  Caliphate.  In  favour of leaving  it  is  the  rivalry  among  traditional claimants, which a transfer of ownership might bring to  a head.  We shall  see more clearly when the question is actually under discussion, and we should not be  too hasty in making up our minds.      (b.) Anatolia. A  policy in regard to the Italian  claims has  been  suggested in  Section  I  above.   We   should hold  firmly to  our  general  principles  of  &quot;no  annexations&quot; and  &quot;self-determination,&quot; and let the local application  follow of itself.  Smyrna and the iEgean littoral, which are largely inhabited by Greeks, will be certain  to oppose any suggestion of Italian ascendancy.  But it is perhaps  not  inconceivable  that the Turks in the region adjoining Adalia, which alone was contemplated  as the  Italian zone originally, might seek Italian support and assistance. (ii.) Black Sea Straits.     The control of the Straits, as a strategic and commercial  highway, is a separate question from that of the territorial sovereignty over the littoral and Constantinople, and we should  not  allow the settlement of the  latter  question  to prejudice the  former, which is of greater importance to us.     Our interests  require  effective international control, that is, control by a  single mandatory Power, and the Power designated must of course be acceptable to us.  We shall be well  advised io work  for the appointment of the United States, failing which, some  mixed International Board of Control, on the model of  the Danube Commission, may become inevitable. (hi.) Dodekannese.     If we  were not  bound to Italy by the Treaty of 1915 (No.  7),  we could, and perhaps should,  use  our friendly offices  with Italy to  secure  the transfer  of the sovereignty  over these  islands  from Turkey  to  Greece.  Italy  has no more moraljustification  for  remaining  there than  for  entering  Anatolia,  but  His  Majesty&apos;s Government are  not free to take  this line, since we  have promised  Italy &quot; complete sovereignty &quot; over the Dodekannese under the original treaty (No. 7,  Article 8), on the strength of which Italy entered the war.     The best way to approach  the solution of this question might be.  to deal with it in connection with the settlement of the Northern Epirus question  and others outstandingbetween Italy and  Greece :  in  other words, to  treat it as a  South-East Europeanrather than a Middle Eastern problem.(iv.) Cyprus.    The disposal of Cyprus may be treated either as a Middle Eastern or a South-EastEuropean problem.  It was  not included in the Middle-Eastern Agreements (except forthe servitude to France, which  was entered into by  His  Majesty&apos;s Government under no. 11, Article 4), but it was involved in the  earlier negotiations  with Greece.   Thepopulation of the island is Greek, with a small Turkish minority.  On the other hand,it has to be  considered geographically in  relation to the Anatolian, Cilician, and  Syriancoastline.    Juridically, Great Britain&apos;s title to possess Cyprus is perfectly good.   We acquiredthe right to &quot;occupy and administer&quot; it under the Cyprus Convention with Turkey, ofthe 4th June, 1878, in the event of Kars-Ardahan-Batum being retained by Russia, andon the condition of assisting the Ottoman Government by force  of arms to defend theirremaining Asiatic territories against any  subsequent Russian aggression.    This Convention, being bipartite only,  lapsed with the outbreak of war, and Cyprus,,as an occupied enemy territory, was annexed by His Majesty&apos;s Government.
       Nevertheless, it will be well to bear in mind (a) that the  population is  Greek, and   (b) that we have already offered the island to Greece during the war,  and that at a   time when Greece was not yet an ally c;1 a belligerent.       HisMajesty&apos;s Government are not, indeed, called upon to make any sacrifice of terri-   tory which  is legitimately under British sovereignty.  It is only if a political situation   should arise in which it would  be useful for His Majesty&apos;s Government to have in hand&apos;   a pawn convenient for negotiating a general settlement  that a  possible cession of   Cyprus to Greece might come up for  consideration.  To what extent, however, such   cession would affect important  strategical  interests of this country is a question which   could only  be  answered by the naval and military authorities.   In this connection it   maybe noted that, when  the  functions of an  &quot; assisting Power&quot; are defined, it must   be laid  down clearly that an invitation to provide assistance shall not carry with it the   right to make use of strategic points in the assisted country.   For  instance, if France   assists Armenia (see below), there must be no  question of a French naval base being   established  at Alexandretta.   (v.)  Armenia.       The  general  principle of  &quot; self-determination &quot;  applies  to Armenia,  but  in this   particular  case  the principle  of &quot; equal  rights  for all nationalities&quot; should take   priority, since throughout  the  country there is  a mixed population with divergent   economic interests and traditional feuds, which cannot be got rid of so  easily as the   Turkish administration that fomented them.   The maintenance  of this principle should   be the first  duty of the mandatory Power.       It would be expedient to extend the  area of Armenia as widely as possible, so as   to  include  all territories  north of the  Arab  boundary in which  there is a  mixed   population of Turks, Armenians, and Kurds.   This would  at the same time conduce   to  a stable settlement,  and  would indirectly  be of  advantage  to His Majesty&apos;s   Government.  The choice of a mandatory virtually lies  between France and America.   If France were chosen, she would obtain a sphere of activity in  this  direction far wider   than that accorded to her under the Agreement of 1916 (see the boundaries  of the Blue   Area), and this should make her more ready to forgo her  claims, under that Agreement,   in  Syria, in case  these  claims  were  not  confirmed  by  the choice of the  Syrians   themselves.   It would be to our advantage, for the same reason/to encourage Russian   Armenia to unite  with Turkish  Armenia  under a single  regime,  and to  favour the   extension of French assistance to the other Caucasian countries,  which will be in need   of help from outside and will hardly be able to obtain it from Russia.*       The attitude of the Armenians may be gathered from the communication recently   addressed to the French and the British Governments  by their National Delegation at   Paris.  They claim the right to set up an  independent Armenian State under the joint   protection of the &quot;Allied Great Powers,&quot;&quot;)&quot; one  of whom is to  be asked to act as a   mandatory &quot; for the organisation and administration of  the new State  for  a term of   years.  An  organic statute drawn up by  the  Protecting Powers would  lay down the   main lines  of the administration of the  new State  during the period of transition,   sanctioning  the  convocation of  a Constituent  Assembly, at  a date approximately   defined, which would determine the  form  of government to be  adopted permanently,   subject to the approval of the Protecting Powers.   The  provisional  administration  to   last long enough, but only so long, as will be necessary  to enable the  survivors of the   deported Armenians,  and Armenians from  other  parts,  to return to their  &apos; National   Home.&apos;&quot;       The principle of equality for all  elements  in the population  is not disputed.  On   the other hand, in settling the proportional claims of these various elements to a  voice  in the government of the country, it  should be laid down in Armenia that the dead and  the exiles should be taken into  account, and Armenian immigrants from other parts of  the world into Armenia should  be given the same facilities as Jewish  immigrants into.  Palestine (see below) for  settling down in their ancestral  homes.  (vi.) Arab Countries in General and Kurdistan.       We should apply the general principles  of self-determination and  free choice of   assisting Power, and should ask King Husein  formally to accept these principles in lieu  of the territorial boundaries of &quot; Arab Independence &quot; which we are pledged to him  to            * See memorandum by Sir Eyre Crowe, circulated to the Eastern Committee.            f Presumably this formula is intended to include the United States.
  obtain.  On the new basis the Arabs would gain more in Syria than they would lose in  Kurdistan, and we shall have an opportunity of suggesting it if and when we recognise  King Husein as &quot; King of the Arabs,&quot;  which will be a change from a  territorial  to a  national title.   If he subscribes  to  &quot; self-determinati n,&quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government  will be in a stronger position  for  handling  the difficulties between him and the other  independent Arab rulers to whom they are committed especially Bin Saud.   (ii.) Arab Federation.      We should be well advised not to make up our minds on this question till  we  see  whether the different Arab countries opt  for the same assisting Power  or for different  Powers in  different cases.   If both Syria and Mesopotamia opted for us, it would be an  advantage to have some very  loose political  connection between them and  the  Hejaz.  This could be arranged by obtaining the appointment of sons  of King Husein  to the  Syrian and Mesopotamian thrones.  (viii.) Caliphate.      We should abstain from all direct action, whether covert  or  avowed;  but we  can  influence the choice of the Moslem world indirectly for example, by our policy in regard  to Constantinople.  (ix.) Arabian Peninsula, excluding Hejaz.      The principles  of self-determination  and free choice of assistance  apply here also,  but we should make  it  clear that our  existing  treaties and relations with various  independent chiefs  are  pre-eminently  applications of this  principle, since we have  never exercised&apos; coercion  in establishing them.   We should obtain a formal  recognition from the other parties to the Peace Conference of such existing  treaties, and of our  exclusive right to make  similar treaties  with the remaining  rulers of the  Peninsula,. if they on their side are willing to make them with us. (x.) Hejaz.     We shall  have to take  up again with the  French  Government the abortive negotiations  of 1917, and endeavour to obtain their agreement to the principle that their  direct  relations with the Flejaz  Government  shall be restricted  entirely to pilgrimage  affairs.     If the French  can be  induced to agree; to this, a precedent will  be set against which it will be difficult for Italy, Holland, and lesser Moslem Powers  to stand out.     The French will probably try to  obtain  our assent to French economic penetration of the Hejaz (and  especially to the  installation of a French  bank  at Jeddah)  in return  for  a recognition  on their part of our  political priority.   But we  should  be well  advised to resist  such suggestions, since  they would open the way for a  return &apos; of French influence by another channel.     It may be  impossible  to. embody any of  these arrangements  regarding the  Hejaz in formal instruments binding  upon all parties concerned. (xi.) Mesopotamia.     We  shall be on safe ground here in taking our stand upon the  principle of free- option, since it  is  evident that the inhabitants do not wish us to withdraw.     We could also put forward our ancient commercial relations with the country, and claim  our right  to  extend the  Pax Britannica from the Persian Gulf, where the benefits  of our presence are admitted by  all, to its  Mesopotamian hinterland.   This historical line of argument might, it is true, give an opening to  the traditional claims of France in Syria and Palestine, and  would in appearance  traverse our  general line  of policy, which is to rest the settlement, not on the claims of outside Powers, but on the self-determination and free choice of the native populations.   Nor would  a recital  of benefits conferred in the Gulf carry much weight  if  it did not appear to  impress a population that was neighbour to the Gulf and had  had an  opportunity of witnessing our activities there for the past hundred years.     The desire  of the people of Mesopotamia  for us to remain there is  really the best proof that our past  work  in the Gulf has been as  good as we assert, and our case ultimately  stands or falls  by it, whichever line  of argument   we take.  We had therefore better take our stand  regarding Mesopotamia upon the choice of the inhabitants, which is not, after all, in doubt.   Nevertheless, it may become necessary to  proclaim asort of Monroe Doctrine, in our favour, in regard to these regions.   It seems imperative   1% [920-1]                                                           G
 to leave no doubt that, whatever happens in  these  territories, Great Britain  cannot allow any other Power to acquire predominant rights there. (xii.) Kurdistan.                                                                   ,      It would be  almost equally safe to rely here too upon the choice of the inhabitants, though  it might also  be  well to  point  out  that the  country is   bound  up  with Mesopotamia  geographically  and economically, and  could  not  lead a  satisfactory existence  if dissociated from it. (xiii.) Syria.      It will be advisable to draw  a distinction  between  the Lebanon (within the old boundaries of the autonomous vilayet, with the inclusion of the Beirut  enclave) and the remainer of the Syrian area.      It is  understood that Sherif Feisal and the  non-Lebanese Syrian Arabs are willing that the Lebanon should maintain its separate existence,  unless, or until,  it desires  to merge itself in the larger Syrian body politic, and that it should receive assistance from France,  so long as it is clearly established that the  French are invited by the free choice of the Lebanese.  Considerable opposition to the paramountcy of French influence  at Beirut may,  however, be offered  by the United States, since the Presbyterian College at Beirut  is one of the most important American missionary institutions in the Middle East, and it would be in danger of being throttled by the rival Jesuit Mission under a French or Francophil  regime.   British  interests, on the other  hand, would not suffer appreciably by the acceptance of French assistance in  the Lebanon, and we can safely maintain an impartial attitude in case of  disagreement between France and America.      It will be all  the more important  not to thwart French aspirations in  the Lebanon if we intend,  as regards the  remainder  of Syria,  to pursue the policy  suggested  in Section  I  above.      It is  understood that the Syrians are  determined to  assert their right of  self- determination and free choice of assistance, that they  have  no intention of asking for the assistance of France, and  that their  choice will  almost certainly  fall  upon Great Britain.    We, on our part,  have simply  to  affirm the general principle,  and to allow the local  application to work itself  out.  But since  in  Syria,  unlike Anatolia, the result may not merely  be to the  disadvantage  of an  Ally, but also, in all probability, to our own  advantage, it  is  particularly desirable that  in this case our action should be so indisputably loyal and correct  as  to  leave no ground for permanent French ill- feeling.      It may be best, therefore, to be perfectly frank with the  French Government, and to tell them beforehand that we insist upon the Syrians exercising a genuinely free choice, and that  we shall do  nothing on our part to bias their decision,  but that we think it not  impossible that they will opt for us,  and that, if  they  do,  we intend to accept the invitation. (xiv.) Palestine.      The problem  of Palestine  cannot be  solved entirely  on  the principles of  self- determination and free choice of  assistance.   As  in  Armenia, there  will  be  a mixed population, and there will be one element in that  population,  in this case the Jewish colonists, which, for  special reasons, will be entitled  to  a position more  than mathe- matically proportionate to its numbers at the start.      Moreover,  in  Palestine there are international  religious interests so important, and so difficult to reconcile, that they almost overshadow the internal  problems of the native inhabitants.      For these reasons, the  desires of the  inhabitants, or of the several sections of them,^will have, to some extent, to take the  second place.  The assisting Power will  be bound to act not merely as their mandatory, but as the mandatory of the world,  and in  cases where local and international interests conflict, the former may often have to give way.      It is essential, therefore, that the mandatory  should be impartial and  effective. An &quot; international administration,&quot; in the literal sense of mixed executive bodies, would evidently  be the  very  worst regime which  could  be  devised to  meet the special Palestinian conditions, and should be  decidedly ruled out.  The practical choice lies between a mandate to the United  States  or a mandate to Great Britain.*  From the British point of view, the balance of advantage  as  between these two solutions is not    * It understood that the Arabs would be less opposed to  Zionist  aspirations in Palestine if  these wereto be realised under British auspices.
 altogether easy to discern, and it might be wise to keep an open mind on  the  question, till we see how the general discussion of the  Middle  Eastern settlement goes, and to take the general situation  into account in eventually making our decision.     As regards boundaries, the Zionists are certain  to  ask for the country  east of Jordan, but there are no Jewish agricultural  colonies  there,  and the inhabitants have clearly manifested their desire to join the Syrian Arab State.-     In the case of  the southern frontier  there  are strong  arguments, on  grounds of tribal geography, for attaching the triangle south of the Rafa-Beersheba line and west of the Wady Arabah to Egypt (see Desiderata III,.6, above), and it is not improbable that this solution would be favoured by the tribes concerned.  But this aim is of minor importance from the British point  of view, and would not be worth pressing if it seemed likely to give our Allies an opening  for representing  that we  were  making a special exception  in our  own favour to the principle of &quot;No  Annexations&quot; as applied to Ottoman territory,  while  insisting upon &quot; Independence &quot;  in areas  which, under the Agreements, had been assigned to them.     The acceptance by all  parties of the principle of &quot; free choice &quot; as the general basisof settlement in Turkey and the Arabian  Peninsula is the  paramount  interest from theBritish point of view.
