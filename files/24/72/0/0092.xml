     MEMORANDUM  ON  THS  FUTURK  OP  THE  AIR  FOgjg      ,     357     Y&apos;  &apos;           AND  AIR  MINISTRY.        Since I submitted -the&apos;proposals for the post-war strength of the Royal Air For ok and the post-war functions of the Air Ministry in G.T, 6478, I have continued to give&quot; consideration to the important questions involved, particularly,  as^no definite or intelligent scheme of1 demobilisation of the Royal *ir Force. can be put in hand until a decision has been given by the Cabinet.   The fact is we cannot demobilise until we know What to demobilise to.        I  thoroughly realise the far-reaching character of the proposals embodied in the memoranda, and the necessity of full discussion and consideration,  but we are faced with the necessity of an Immediate decision on account of the grave unrest existing in the Service due in the main to all  our officers  only holding temporary commissions and therefore boing in complete ignorance as to their caroer and future; while at the same time,  no&apos; intelligent action can be taken in regard to innumerable questions regarding aerodromes, accommodation, buildings, and equipment, Further it is becoming cloar that the  part of the proposals  . dealing with civil aviation must be carried out on  the lines       . indicated at the earliest possible date.        IVhilo an excellent case has been made cut for the        &apos; constitution of a very strong  post-war Air Force, with ample        *, reserves  and in a position to  be available for action on a declaration of war,  I am prepared to admit that a preponderating factor In the whole matter must be finance,  a question of balance, how much  should the country spend on its Air ^force  ,  and how much the  country can spend,        The true solution would probably involve treating the permissible expenditure on the Navy, Army and Air Force together  - as a national premium which must be paid to secure  national security, and constituting a central defence authority to work out the allocation to each Service in  conjunction with the different staffs.  This procedure, however,  will not meet the present situation where a decision is  required at once,  and accordingly,  I have again $one carefully over the estimated  sums required.and quoted in G,T,  6478 as 41 millions. As stated, this is an ftstiihaVe of a very approximate character indeed,  the d:iff$rerrt-. factors involvod being impossible to estimate correctly &quot;at present;  moreover,  the sum in question was based on what&quot;would be  required to maintain  a Force  without regard to the amount  of technical equipment  inherited from the war.   Accordingly, I  have  had the estimate revised,  with  a fuller knowledge of  the commitments of the Ministry  of Munitions oh contracts,  as regards the item  of technical material on the  basis of utilising as  far as possible  the supplies of aeroplanes and engines which are either on charge of the Royal Air Force at present,  or must be accepted by-the  air Force from the Ministry of  Munitions In  view of the operation of the break clause  In the contracts.        As a result  of this further revision,  the estimate for each of the  years&quot; 1919 and 1920 can be reduced by approximately  10,000,-000,  leaving for each  of these years a total estimate of some  30,000,000.  I still include in  this estimate  two millions per annum to be definitely allocated to experiment  and research.        I  have already pointed  out that any estimates which can now be given  are purely  provisional and it is conceivable that in actual  working the  sum required may bo less  - no allowance has been made for such  factors as  the increased efficiency  of personnel In peace  time as compared with war tine.
