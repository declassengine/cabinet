December  5th. i9l8,      2 Whitehall Gardens, S.W.Sir,       At a Conference just held, representative of the retail  ,trade in Great Britain, at which the following Organisationsviz  :-       The Licensed Victuallers&apos; Central Protection Society            of London.       Licensed Victuallers&apos; lefence League of England and            Wales,       Beer, Spirit and Wine Trade National Defence League,       National Federation of  off-licence Holders,       London Free On-licence Holders&apos; Association,       Manchester Central Board,       Northern Districts&apos; League, \       Scottish- Licensed Trade Defence Associationwere  represented by their responsible heads,  it was reported, asthe result of an interview with the Ministry of Food,  that theWar Cabinet has under its consideration the making of a new BeerOrder, and in so far as this will affect retail licence holdersI was requested to ask the War Cabinet to kindly receive a smallDeputation, representative of the Organisations named-  with a viewto placing before the Cabinet material points- bearing&apos;on thequestion mentioned.&quot;       I trust  it may be convenient  for the Deputation to bereceived at an. early date.       Awaiting your kind reply,              I am Sir,                 Your obedient Servant,                      (Signed)  ALLAN S,  B1LSHBR,                                   Chairman of the Conference.
                            III                                     December 13th, 1918.      I think that there is very little in these requests, it isonly natural that parties interested in any new legislation should try and get special interviews with the powers that be, moreespecially as they consider that any suggested alteration or nowintroduction to existing conditions might, interfere with orprejudice their interests,.      In this case the Brewers were in agreement with the greaterpart of the scheme and I think it is the larger proprietaryBrewers alone who think that, although they can still make goodprofits, their goodwill may be injured, while the LicensedVictuallers asserted that they did not mind what prices were fixed so long as their profits were not reduced, which means thatthey desired that oho Brewers prices to the licence holders shouldbe fixed, and I am given to understand that it is universallyagreed that it is not pcssible to fix a flat rate,  and only &quot;by setting up in the various areas Committees, consisting of Brewersand LiceVice holders,  can the matter be satisfactorily dealt with,      In those areas  where the experiment has been made thissystem is working satisfactorily, and I am informed that the brewers Society met the representatives of the LicensedVictuallers and agreec. that this basis of procedure should be recommended to the. trade in general,                              Tho Brevrers,&apos;  Society,                                  tyueen Anne1 o Chambers,                                      Westminster,                                         December 10th.  1918.Sir,       I am directed to ask-through you whether the  War  Cabinet will grant an interview to a small deputation from  this  Society, who are anxious to discuss the reasons why the schedule  of maximum retail prices for beer in the form at present proposed should not be included in any Order.    They feel strongly that such extended schedule :-.3 not only uncalled for by  the  jfcublio but will prove altogether impracticable in operation.       At the eame tine the deputation would wish to discuss the Memorandum and Resolutions I had the  honour of transmitting to the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer  on November 28th,                   I am.  Sir,                      Yours faithfully,                          (Signed)  P, C. $ORGAN, The Secretary,                                Secretary,   The &quot;War Cabinet,     2 Whitehall Gardens,  S.W,
      I do not see ths/fr-emy good purpoee would be scr-re-d.vhygranting the interviews asKtsd for, hut quito realise that ihio-is a point which the War Cabinet alone should decide, but itshould be pointed out that it is imperative that the cabinet should give its. decision at once, us the trade must receivenotice in advance of any alt oration GO that it can make thenecessary adjustments, and as the  Customs and Excise pointout it is desirable that any new regulation should only comeintr\ force at the commencement of a quarter.                         (Signed)  G-, WALTER ROFFEY.IV.      I have read the letter from the Licensed Victuallers1Central Protection Society of London, Ltx., of December 5th,and the letter from the Brewers&apos; Society of December 10th.      This Department ha3 not taken part in the discussion between the Pood ,Controller and the Trade regarding the nowOrder affecting prices, but the changes are unquestionably astep in the right direction..  The schedule proposed represents an improvement on present conditions both as regards the inte:&apos;r^of the consuming public and the interest of Tenporance,                           &apos;(Intd.)
