WAR  CABINET.FINANCIAL   RISKS  ATTACHING  TO  THE  HOLDING   OF   TRADING                                   STOCKS.                  NOTE BY THE MINISTER OF RECONSTRUCTION.    I CIRCULATE a summary of the report of  the Financial  Risks  Committee.The proof of the draft report has already  been circulated  (G.T.-6487).                                                   (Signed)    C.  ADDISON.    Ministry of Reconstruction,        December 21, 1918.FINANCIAL  RISKS COMMITTEE.                             SUMMARY OF REPORT.     1. The terms of reference are as follows :          &quot; To enquire and  report as to any measures which could be adopted with a     view to securing that manufacturers and others should  be financially in a position     to hold stocks after the war, and that reasonable  safeguards are established to     prevent serious financial losses as a result  of possible depression following on a   ,  period of great inflation in respect of stocks of materials required for industry.&quot;     2. The Committee draws attention  to the  enormous rise, &quot;which  has  taken place during the war, in the prices of raw materials and goods.     3. There are five main causes likely to operate in reduction of prices :      (L)  The disappearance of war risk insurance, etc.     (2.)  Increase in the available shipping will lead to a reduction in freights.     (3.)  Increase in available labour supply on demobilisation will cause a fall in wages,           compared with  rates prevailing during the war.     (4.)  The  cessation  of  demand  for military  material will release additional pro-           ductive capacity for the supply of staple articles now  standing  at &quot; scarcity           prices.&quot;     (5.)  The reduction of the note issue until  an effective gold standard  is attained.           In other words, &quot; deflation.&quot;     Prices are, however, unlikely to  fall to the level  prevailing before the war, at anyrate for a very considerable period.     4. The Committee  consider  that  the  apprehension  of losses  due to a  drop inpresent inflated prices is well founded.     5. The trader puts forward-three lines of possible relief:-     (1.)  Lower rates of taxation during the war.     (2.)  The Government to bear a  share (out of taxes now received) in  any losses           after the war.
      (3.) A re-definition of &quot;profits&quot;  now f, chargeable  to taxation by  way  of the            allowance of special reserves as expenses in arriving at profits, or  more            particularly by the  adoption of principles of valuing stocks, when making up            periodical  accounts, other  than those  generally  obtaining  in  industry            hitherto, or admitted by the taxing authorities.      6. Up to the present relief has  been granted by two concessions contained in the White Paper (Cd. 8623), viz. :-      (1.)  An  allowance is made for the fall in  the value  of stocks held in the  last accounting period, to the extent to which they are realised in the succeeding two years.      (2.)  The privilege  of taking a -constant quantity of stock  at a constant value is allowed in any class of trade      (a.) which requires for its manufacturing processes to keep such stocks, and     (b.) in which a  recognised practice has obtained of taking a constant quantity at a            constant price.     Only a very limited  number of industries have  obtained  this second concession.Those who have  will commence the  post-war  period with  stocks valued considerably below their market  price, and in the opinion of the Committee  &quot; have established  nofurther title to relief.&quot;     With regard to the first concession, the principal criticisms are :      (1.) It is unworkable, because the  physical  indentity of the stocks sold cannot in           practice  be ascertained.     (2.) It is inadequate, as relating only to one set of sales.     The Committee recommend that, when effect is given  to these  undertakings, bythe promised statutory regulation, it should be clearly conceded that the trader will notbe required to prove that the stock sold is the identical stock originally held.     (The question of relief in the case of those who have paid no excess profits duty, andthose who have denuded themselves of stock at the instance of Government, is discussed in paragraphs 14-15.)                                Suggested Remediest     1.  The more hopeful line of approach to a partial solution of the problems lies in a consideration of the  present rate of duty.     An 80 per cent,  duty  encourages extravagance and  discourages  enterprise, thereward being paltry.     Little margin is left for renewals, development, and capture of new markets,  to say nothing of reserves against bad  times.     If the  rate  had not  been  raised  beyond, say, 65 per  cent., it  would have beenreasonable to require taxpayers  to furnish reserves to meet the difficulties which theCommittee have to consider,  and they think  there is  much  force  in the  contention  of witnesses that the revenue from such a  rate would have been little, if at all, lower than80 per cent. rate.     The Committee  prefer, as a remedy, a reduction  in  the excess  profits duty from80 per cent, to 65 per cent, for the accounting period approximating  to the year 1918,and now in course of assessment, on the understanding that the  duty so given up is retained in the business and not distributed.  They regard it as most desirable that theposition of business  should be specially  strengthened when entering on the threshold ofa period in which markets have to be reorganised or created, and in which industrial conditions are in a high degree uncertain.  Such a reduction  might be accompanied bythe withdrawal of the first concession in the White Paper.     2.  If this course be impracticable, they suggest that a portion of the duty now tobe paid, should  be  treated as  a suspensory reserve  for a period  of five years.   Theamount so treated to be represented  by a special kind of war loan  to be  held  on jointaccount by the Government and the taxpayer.  The amount  of the reserve to be 20 percent,  of the average  excess of profits above the standard in the last two years under thecharge to excess profits duty.   After five years the reserve  to revert to the State, or,in the following circumstances, become wholly or in part the property of the taxpayer:      (1.) If his average annual profits over that period are less than the amount of the           percentage standard  to which  he was entitled, or would have  been  entitled,           under the Excess Profits Duty;  and
262     (2.) If these  deficiencies have been connected with holding stock at falling  prices           (as distinct, for example, from bad management or reduced turnover) during           that period;     (3.) He would be entitled to claim relief against the reserve to the extent of 80 per           cent,  of his deficiency, but such relief is in any case limited to  the  total           amount of the reserve;     (4.) Should a taxpayer desire to close the transaction before  the expiry of five           years,  he may do so at the end of three or four years, by taking the average           trading results up to these dates, with  the right to claim respectively three-           fifths or four-fifths of the reserve.     The undertakings given in the White Paper should continue to stand,  and eachbusiness should state,  when  making its  return  for assessment for  the  last period,whether it proposes to come under the White Paper, or, waiving all rights thereunder,to come under the five-year war loan system of relief.     A Reservation has been signed by four of the  ten members of the Committee thatin their opinion :      (1.) All firms and companies so electing should be permitted  to adopt  the  base           price  method  of  stock  valuation,  but that  prices  must  not   be  lower           than they  have actually  reached &quot;at  cost  or market value&quot;  within the           traders  experience (the  base  stock method  of valuation  is discussed  in           paragraphs 9-18 of the Eeport);     (2.) If the reduction  of the  tax cannot be  granted, the amount allowed  as  &amp;           suspensory reserve is too low and should be at  least double.)
