GOVERNMENT PURCHASE OF 1919 FLAX CROP.

Memorandum by the Chief Secretary for Ireland.

Lord Colwyn, Chairman of the Flax Control Board and the Empire Flax Growing Committee, has informed me that in order to secure a sufficient acreage under flax in Ireland in 1919, it will be necessary to guarantee a price for the crop.

He points out the danger of relying on external sources of supply for a raw material as vital to industry in times of peace as it is to military operations in times of war.

In Ireland last year there were about 142,000 acres under flax, an increase of nearly 100,000 acres over pre-war figures. The Flax control Board consider that the increase will vanish entirely next year unless a price  is guaranteed. The whole benefit of the war-time development would thus be lost, and the linen trade of the North-east of Ireland might find itself without raw material in the event of supplies not coming in from Russia, which supplie? about 80 per cent of the fibre used by flax spinners in the United Kingdom before the war.

The price being said by the Ministry of Munitions for Irish fibre of the 1918 crop is from 35s. Od. to 45s. Od. per stone, and that said for 1917 crop was from 25s. Od. to 35s. Od. per stone. The Flax Control Board have recommended that the price for the 1919 Irish crop should be the same as in 1917, and I ask the Cabinet to sanction the purchase by the Government of the 1919 Irish crop at these prices.

The English Board of Agriculture have already made contracts with farmers in Great Britain guaranteeing them £16 per ton for ? flax straw of the 1919 crop. This is estimated as equivalent to an average price of about 35s. Od. per stone of scutched flax produced under conditions obtaining in Ireland.

The Ministry of Munitions and  War Office, in contemplation of a continuance of war in 1919, had already purchased large supplies of flax seed, which if not required for sowing in Ireland may entail a very substantial loss.

It is not  ?ossible to state the loss that might be incurred in guaranteeing the above prices for Irish  flax, but Lord Colwyn in his letter to me states that it might range from £800,000 to £1,600,000. The actual loss


however will depend  largely u,?on the supply of fibre  thatrosy be obtained from ;.ussia, and the consequent effect upon  the worlds  or ice.      It has to be remembered  that the world&apos;s demands  forlinen goods must be  vory great Indeed since, for  the  past few yerrs, r,,ar requirements have absorbed the bulk  offibre supplies,.   It is possible therefore that the world&apos;smar,cot nice of flax fibro may remain so high that  theactual ioss may be less than the above estimate,      As , -irmers arc now preparing their lands for next year&apos;s crops and as their plans with record  to theserins&apos; of flax - ill  defend upon the policy of the government regarding the 1919 crop, i desire tc ma icean immedi&amp;te announcement on the matter.                              (Signed)  miAIW SHORTT,ISISH OFFICE j  5,17,     29th December, 1918.
