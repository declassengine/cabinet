1  HBsi Document is the  Property  of His Britanaio Majesty^ $mmmmtl      h nCONFIDENTIAL.p. ar.THE QUESTION OF ITALIAN CLAIMS.    THE Congress will be faced by very great difficulties over the question of Italian claims, and the possibility of giving Italy satisfaction alike for her efforts in the war and for her territorial, strategic, and  economic  require- ments.   These Italian claims may be divided  into three parts:     (I.) Territories justly claimed by Italy on the ground of  the racial affinity of their  inhabitants, or  of a con- siderable  portion of them, with the Italians, or of their wish to be united with Italy.    (2.) Territories which, though not containing popula- tions which can be regarded  as  Italian on the  grounds either of race or of self-determination, are considered by Italy vital for  the protection of her frontiers and coasts or  to which  she  conceives  herself,  owing   to  their vicinity  to possess a prior claim to any other Power.    (3.) Asiatic and  African territories which are con- sidered by Italy  as  falling naturally within the proper zone of Italian control either on grounds of strategic and economic interests, or because the  political equilibrium between the colonial  possessions of the  Great Powers is thereby safeguarded in the interests of Italy.    Further (4) (overlapping and partly including  both (1), (2), and (3) ),  are  the territories already mentioned under these respective headings which have been assured to  Italy  by her Agreements with  the British, French, and former Russian  Governments in 1915  and  1917, as well as previous engagements entered into by Italy with any or all of these Governments.    It is proposed in this Memorandum, without entering into geographical detail or urging any particular solution, such as can only be proposed and accepted after consul-; tation between all those responsible for British interests in  the different spheres enumerated, to pose the question of  what possibilities there are of satisfying Italian claims without serious injury either to principles such as self- determination, for which we have declared  ourselves to; be  fighting, or for vital British, colonial,  strategic,  and economic interests.                                  1  ,    (1.) The different areas may be  examined  in turn.1, Under heading (1) are the territories inhabited by Italian majorities outside  the present boundaries of Italy.  This roughly   includes  the  part  of  the  former  Austrian, province of Tirol, generally known as the  Trentino, from., the Italian frontiers as far north as a  line running  from the Ortler  group south-eastwards  to  Mezzo  LombardO&apos; and thence north-east .to [the  Marmolata group, as well as  a few  small adjustments  of frontier  further  east. Further, within this category fall the territories (I) round Gradisca  and Aquileia, between the Italian frontier and the Isonzo, and in  some cases beyond it; (II) a thin;, coastal strip round the Gulf of Trieste,-including the city of  Trieste; (III)  the western, coast  and about half of the hinterland of Istria within a line running practically due south, from just east of Trieste to just east  of Pola. Beyond  these  territories there is nothing  that can be- claimed on the eastern coast of the Adriatic as Italian hf       [990-28]
 race, with the exception of the cities of Fiume and Zara, which,  though they contain small  Italian majoritit,  in the  two  towns  themselves,  are  surrounded  by over- whelming- Slav populations.    (2.)  Under heading (II) the  territories enumerated under   heading     are  considerably  expanded.  For instance, on strategic grounds, probably legitimate, Italy claims not only the Italian-speaking  Trentino, but  the whole of Tirol  up to the  Brenner  Pass, enclosing  con- siderable  German-speaking majorities.*   Not only  does she claim the Gradisca-Acjuileia district, hut a line running considerably furtlfer east &apos;and enclosing both  territories, with mixed  Italian affd- Slav populations and territories purely Slav.  This  line includes within her frontiers the whole of Istria.  Passing further&quot; south  it takes in not only thegreat majority of the islands in the Adriatic, but half of Dalmatia (ix., the northern!half down to Cape Palanka), although, both in the case of the islands and of Northern Dalmatia, the  population  is  practically  entirely Jugo- Slav.   Further down the Adriatic she not only proposes to annex Valona,  but to obtain a  Protectorate over the whole of Albania.    Mention  has only been  made  here  of the territories officially claimed by the Italian Government, not of those which a section of  the  Italian press, led by  &quot;LTdea Nazionale,&quot; would like  to  see included  in  Italy.   The latter&apos;s  chauvinist  pretensions would include, further, Piume and practically the whole of Dalmatia as far south as  the  river Narenta..   On  the other hand,  moderate opinion  in Italy, as typified  by the &quot; Unita,&quot; &quot; Secolo,&quot; and to some  extent  the &quot; Oorriere della Sera,&quot;  i.e. mainly Eadical  and reformed Socialist opinion,  fearful of  pro- voking a permanent quarrel with the Jugo-Slavs, would, while maintaining the full  measure of Italian claims in the Tirol and round Trieste, abandon the  eastern corner of Istria (east of Monte Maggiore) and the  whole of Dalmatia,  with  most of the  islands,  to the  Jugo-Slav State.    In the  case  of  Albania there  appears to be no difference  of opinion as to  the need for  an  Italian Protectorate, though there may be  difference of opinion as to the way in which this  Protectorate shall be secured.    (3) The territories  falling under  this heading  are (a)  The regions  of South and  West Asia Minor, in which Italy claims  a prior  interest, and which  the  1915  and 1917 Agreements acknowledged to be within her sphere ; (b)  the  Dodekanese, regarded  as  important  both as controlling the entrance to the kEgean  and as  command- ing the approach to the Anatolian coast;  (c) adjustments of the Libyan frontier giving Italy certain points, mainly oases, at present under Tunisian or Egyptian admiuistra- tion;  (d) territories  connected with Eritrea and Italian$omaliland, with  which is bound   up the question of Italian influence on Abyssinia.    It  is hard  to  say  to  what  extent   Italian public opinion  is interested in these  acquisitions.   They  are naturally considered as  offering good outlets for Italian capital and colonising energy, and  the  relative insuccess of the Libyan venture does not seem to have altogether damped  colonial enthusiasm.    (4.) Our official commitments to Italy come under the   * According to  the  &apos;;Neue  Freie Presse&quot; (November 17;, the-figures for Central Tirol are : German, 215,853;  Ladin, 9,462;  Italian, 7,047.
 two headings of the Treaty of London, the 26th April, 1915, and the Anglo-Italian Agreement, the 8th August, 1917.    I, By the Treaty of London, Italy was to receive    (a.) Tirol, as far north as a line running from Stelvio through the Brenner Pass  up to the  Venediger-Spitze, and then south to the old Italian frontier east of Cortina.    (6.)  The Austrian provinces of Kiistenland  and Istria up to a line running from Triglav east of Adelsberg down to  the coast just west of Fiume.    (c.)  All  the  islands of the Adriatic except Veglia, Arbe, Solta, Brazza, and Sabbioncello.    (d.) Northern Dalmatia clown to Cape Palanka.    (e.) Valona and an enclave round it.    (/.) Protectorate over  Central Albania.    (g.) The Dodecanese.    (k.) The recognition of her interest in the maintenance of balance of power in the Mediterranean, and, in the event of  the partition of the partial partition of the Ottoman Empire,  or even the redistribution of zones of interest in Turkey,  an equitable share in the region of Adalia.    li.)  If Britain or France obtain  an increase in their colonial  possessions  in  Africa,  Italy might in principle claim equitable compensation, particularly in the shape of  a favourable settlement of questions affecting frontiers between Eritrea, Somaliland, and Libya and the adjacent British and French colonies.    (Only territorial commitments are here stated.)    II.-Under the  Agreement of the  8th  August, 1917,  we pledge ourselves, &quot;subject to the consent of Russia &quot; (which has not been obtained), that     (a.)  Italy might  administer a zone consisting of  the southern  half of  Asia   Minor  stretching   from  the northern point of  the Gulf of Smyrna,  east  to  the Erjies JDagh, and bounded on the east  by a line running thence  south-west to the coast  between  Mersina  and Maidan.    (6.)  In the zone north of this, running up  to just south of Edrimid and  Brusa, and including Kutaya  and AkSheh, Italy might  appoint functionaries, &amp;c, on  the same terms as  France and Britain  are allowed to do so in the zones created under the Sykes-Picot Agreement.    (c.)  Italy   was  to   enjoy  reciprocal  commercial privileges in the Allied  zones.    \d.)  If, as  a result of  the war, it were found impos- sible to partition the Ottoman Empire to the full extent contemplated in the above agreements, then the principle of the balance of power  in  the Mediterranean  will be observed in any distribution which takes place.    It is, therefore,  a  question for. British and  Allied policy  as to  which  of these claims, enumerated  under the four  headings, can  be  accepted  as conforming with Allied  engagements and not  clashing either  with  the principles for  which, we have  declared  we are fighting or with our vital interests.  It is clear that the territories enumerated under (1) pass without dispute to Italy, both on  the  grounds of the  principle  of   nationality  and because they are all  included in the territories assigned to  Italy by  the Treaty of  London;   (2) and (3)  are closely connected, and they are both in  the main coveredby (4).   Territories enumerated under (3), however, were
 granted  to Italy with a less binding sanction than those under (2), for the 1917 Agreement, to which the signature of Russia was never affixed, may possibly be regarded as having lapsed.  The Treaty of  London, on  the other hand, is  certainly still binding.   It is true that casuistic objections may be raised from our side that the Italians have  not fulfilled the letter  of the  treaty in  several respects.   In one  or two cases they have gone further, and  may even  be considered  to  have violated  its spirit. For instance, whereas by the treaty only a protectorate over Central Albania was accorded to Italy, Northern and  Southern  Albania being  left open to Serbia and Greece respectively,  the  Italian Government  in June, 1917, on their  own  initiative, proclaimed a protectorate over the whole of Albania.  Further, the agitation, which the Italian Government have taken no measures to dis- courage,  for the annexation of Fiume to Italy would be, if it  came to anything, a flagrant violation both of the letter and spirit of the treaty.   But it may be submitted that it is  not the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government to insist  too much  on these infractions  of the  treaty  by Italy.   We must make it perfectly  clear (1)  that we have not had and have not now any intention  either of breaking  our  pledged word or of appearing to break it; (2) that, on the other hand, President Wilsorrs  principle that  no populations  should  be  transferred  from  one allegiance to another without their own consent  has been accepted by all  the belligerents, the Italian Government included; (3) that we have, both indirectly and directly, given every encouragement to the movement for Jugo-Slav union  and independence, and  are obviously,  therefore, bound in honour not to put any unreasonable obstructions in  the way of the attainment  of this object;  (4) thatthe Italian Prime Minister himself has recognised thatthe achievement of Jugo-Slav unity is not opposed  to the vital interests of Italy.
