Circulated by the Secretary of  State for India  with reference  to the Resolutions submitted    to the Cabinet  by the Eastern Committee.   (G.T. 6512.)SECKET.     I regret that I am unable to agree with the  Recommendation No.  7 on  the future of the Caucasus, which, 1 understand, my colleagues propose to submit to the Government, and I must ask that the following reasons for dissent, on my part should be communicated to the Cabinet.     The circumstances which led us to intervene in the Caucasus and on the Caspian were to my mind  entirely  temporary.  With the  collapse of Russia,  the door of Afghanistan via the Caucasus, Caspian, and  the Trans-Caspian Railway has been thrown open to our enemies, and it was realised that even  the  appearance of a small Turco-German force on the confines of Afghanistan might render the Amir&apos;s position impossible and throw Afghanistan and the tribes of the North-West Frontier of India into the war against us.  It had been  a difficult and  complicated enough task as it was to enable the  Amir to restrain the forces of  fanaticism aroused  at Turkey&apos;s participation  in the Avar,  It was, therefore, essential in  these  special circumstances to do what was possible to assist such  anti-enemy elements as  there might be in the Caucasus.     Now, however  the whole position has altered, and  so far as the defence of India is concerned, it does not seem to me necessary  for  us to give a thought to  the Caucasus.   I feel  that  this region is entirely outside  the range of our interests. Recommendation No.  7  contemplates,  it is true reluctantly, the possibility of  our undertaking the retention of troops ill the Caucasus,  not indeed as a permanency,  but for an indefinite period, a commitment which appears unwarranted on either political or strategic grounds.     I feel confident that public opinion in this country will view with grave suspicion any new military commitments when the war has ceased, and I do not think we should take the role of  preserving  law and order in  all countries where without our inter- vention law and order may be jeopardised.  When  a de facto  Government or group of Governments have emerged from the present chaos there, it will be time enough to consider what our relationship to each should be, though in view of our very nebulous interest in those regions, it is difficult to see that any such arrangements will be called for, provided that the integrity of Persia is respected.     I have not forgotten  the Baku oil-fields and the allegation that they are of inter- national interest, but if this is  so, their protection  should, I think, be undertaken by an  international force based  on  Batoum.   Even  though we  have troops  there at present, I do not think we should accept the task of  safeguarding the oil-fields alone. Our own interests in them  would not appear to justify this.  I.am not convinced myself that the Caucasus has any political or strategic  interest  to  India, aiid  our troops should, it seems to me, be removed  as soon as possible.  I do not think a request that India should contribute in money, men, or munitions to the maintenanceof order or to the occupation of this region would be justifiable.                                                                     E.  S.  M.     17th December 1918.10 SS 27   60  12/18
