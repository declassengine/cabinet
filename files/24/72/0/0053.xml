IgHIB DOQUhhhT 1^ gHS xtiO?i,KTY 0/ HItt BHlJLUhllQ ^JiaSgY&apos;&amp; QOWIiUlMU)IS   0 RE rf.G.T.-6552,&apos;7 A II   0 A 3 I II E T.   *   H0USI1IS  OP  THE  V/ORICIirGr  CLASSES.Memorandum from the first Commissioner of vjorks.IV      With roforenco to the memorandum  by the President  of  tho Local Government Board on the housing  of the working classes, G.2.6497, I wish to refer to the proposals  sot out  in part 3 regarding central Departmental machinery.   I would like to urge most strongly that the question of the supervision  of the erection of houses by local authorities and the erection of houses by the Stato, is part of the duties which must properly fall within the province of His hajesty^ Offioo of Works, rather than the Xooal Government Board.   The Office of &apos;,orks not only has the necessary technical staff with practical experience  of tho provision and building of houses,  but it has throughout  the war been engaged on tho erection of very important Government  Garden Cities,  such as tho ;:ell Hall Estate,  Woolwich (which is now regarded as  one of tho models of this  type of work) Farnbo rough,  Hosyth,  Hendon,  etc. ,   2?ho architects of tho  Office  of Works have  also carried out an enormous amount of building  work during the  war and aro therefore  thoroughly up to  date  in  regard to the  important tochnical questions that have arisen  and will arise  in the  near future regarding  material, sourcos  of  supply,  organisation of labour forces,  and other difficulties,  all of vhich  //ill be  o  the utmost  importance. -   I might further  point  out th&amp;t  the  Offico of  Works has in  tho past been the  advisory authority on the building of  houses  to  the Public Works Loan Board,.                     ^     It  would  seem to  mo a grave  administrative mistake,  when centralisation  of function has  beoomo  the accepted standard of administration,  as instanced  by  the  creation of the  Linistry of Supply, to  again have two  departments with  separate staffs dealing with the  same  question.    I  would point out  that  in the memorandum which  I sont to tho Machinery of  Government Committee of which  Lord Haldano was tho Chairman, and  in other variousmemoranda which  I have  submit tod from time to time,  I have very strongly emphasised this important point, .     I may further state that the Department which the LocalGovernment Board now proposes to set up will bo only one  of the many activities of a very large and unwieldy Department,  of whichhe-is tho head, while it will bo possible for the i?irstCommissioner of Works, if this question is placed under his department,  to give it more personal supervision as  a hinisterthan can reasonably be expected from tho President of the LocalGovernment Board,fc,Office of Works.(Signed). -AIuPBBD MOIID.ggrd December,  1918,
