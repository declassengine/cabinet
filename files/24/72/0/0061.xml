RELEASE OF IRISKTOS.JVHD WOKEN INTERNED IK               ENGLISH PRISONS       IpMv 0r[j5f THE&quot; REALM                          &quot; pGllLATiOH 14 B.     (Memorandum by the Chief Secretary for.....Irglandj        It hag become  necessary again ti raiso the  question of the   Irishmen and women  who  are interned in English Prisons under   Defence of the Roalm Regulation 14B.        The provisions under which they are interned are as follows:-        Section one  of the Defence of the Realm  (Amendment) Aot,   1915,  can be suspended  &quot;in the event of invasion or  other special   military emergency  arising out of the present war.&quot;  Where the   section is so  suspended, as has been the case in Ireland since   the  rebellion  cf Easter, 1916, any person can if he  or she is   &quot;suspected of  acting or having acted or being about  to act in a   manner prejudicial  to the public safety cr the defence of the   Realm11 be arrested  ana  interned without trial.        It is, therefore,  necessary to bear clearly in  mind two   things :-        First, that  the powers of the Regulation can only bft&quot;   exercised where an  Order has been made based upon invasion or   spec.!.;::], military  emergency arising out cf the war; and second,   *hci these men and  women are net convicted cf any crime  but   cv.-t!  detained ou suspicion without trial; and  the question has   arisen how much longer  in present circumstances  it is possible   to maintain the suspension of section one of  the Act of 1915   and  to keep these people looked up.I        I have net had an  opportunity cf discussing the matterj   with His Excellency before sending in this memorandum, but when   wo last discussed it we were agreed that it was  highlyI   desiiable that these people should he kept out of Ireland as   long as possible, and I have no doubt that Hie Excellency will   adhere to that opinion, as also do I myself.  But it is   neoeasary to face the situation vliich is bound to arise.  Already   indications of an agitation for their release have appeared, and   the  prisoners  themselves are demanding that they should now be   allowed to return to their homes as there ian ne longer be   any  fear of Germany.  In one or two of the prisons they are   threatening mutiny. If the agitation grows it will  be extremely   difficult to contend -that there is now any such  special military   emergency arising out of the war as would justify detaining them   indefinitely without trial.        It is highly important that if they are  to  be released   they should be released with as little- show of weakness as   possible.  I have consulted vdth the Inspector General of theRoyal
&amp;yal Irish Constabulary and the Chief Commissioner ot theWblin Metropolitan police and they both adrise me that to release them quietly and return them quietly to/their homeswoukd have a much les3 evil effect in Ireland t&apos;han wouldtheir release if brought about &quot;by agitation outside and mutinyinside the prisons,  if the reports are correoJj that the meninterned in Australia in similar fircumstances are beingunccnditicnally released, it- would lend an added weight to anyagitation in this country.     I would a3]c for a decision of the War cabinet upon thepolicy which ought to be pursued in all the circumstances.(Sgd.)   EDWARD SHORTT.Ian ?,fficc,  SIW.27th December, 1918.I
