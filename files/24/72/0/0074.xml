D0CU3EKT IS THE PROPERTY 01 HIS BRITANNIC ] AJ!S5TY!S GOVERNMENT.)    296IMPERIAL WAR CABINET.NOTES ON INDEMNITY.           I venture to oirculate the following  Paper  by  Colonel    Amcry to the Imperial War Cabinet.                           (Signed)   M.P.A.  HANKEY.2 &quot;fcltehall Gardens,Secretary.list &quot;Dncembor ,191b.         It is not necessary here to discuss the question how far1   the Allies may, by their correspondence with President Wilson, have   limited their right to exact from Germany any indemnity they think   fit.         There is,* however, a clear distinction between an indemnity   which only aims at making good the loss actually Buffered in   consequence  of the aggression of the Central Powers and one which   goes beyond that, and aims &quot;both at securing a direct profit  for   the conquerors and at crippling the conquered in order to prevent   their recovery from the -war.   Both these latter aims were present   in the mind of the Germans when, in 1871, they imposed on Prance   an indemnity greatly in excess of the gross cost of the war to   themselves ^nd only limited by the mistaken assumption that  Franoe   could not pwssi,bly pay more.   But it is assumed in these notes   that the Allies are only concerned with reparation, the making   good of loss actually suffered by them.         Given this assumption there is, however,  only one intelligible   and logical basis for the assessment of an indemnity,  and that   is the total loss suffered hy the Allies.   There Is no reason   in equity why the Enemy Towers should be taxed with less.   If they prove that they cannot pay it, then the amount  may have to.   be scaled down.f like a bankrupt&apos; s composition.    But the basis of.   assessment should still remain the total loss,  in whatever shape   it may have been incurred.    Any other basis would - entirely   apart  from the consideration of what the enemy can or  cannot  pay  -   result in a hopelessly unfair apportionment of  the indemnity   between the Allies.         To realise this it is enough to glance at two tables   given  in the Treasury Memorandum (P.  46).   One table  gives  the   total  gross cost of  the war to each of the Allies,  showing that   the British Empire has expended  6,660,000,000,  exclusive  of  loans   to its Allies,  as against   4,100,000 000 spent  by France.    The   othertable gives the loss  incurred bj  each Ally in the  shape  of   direct damage inflicted on  civilian property by ene-my  action.I   On this basis the whole British Empire could only claim a maximumI   indemnity of  600,000,000,  while  France could apparently ask  for    2-, 500,000,000,  or over four tim?s  as mucfr.   It  is  obvious  that   the basis of direct  damage  to civilian property would be grossly   unfair to the British Empire.SECRET.G.T.  6m.
      It  would work out no less unfairly as &quot;between different parts of  tho British Empire   The direct loss due to thc^enemy^sair  raids  and submarine warfare has fallen almost wholly uponproperty  owned in the United Kingdom.  Cn the other feand  thereduction  9f our shipping by tho submarines&apos;has created indirectloss to the whole Empire, but mere particularly to the remoterDominions  and Colonies,   Australia and New Zealand have had their whole economic life strangled by the-, shipping shortage.   In theUnited Kingdom the &apos;gre.at development of agriculture, the  opening up of new  mines,  the impetus to shipbuilding, oan all be  reokonedas a partial set off against the direct and indirect loss in-flioted by submarine warfare,   America and Canada ha\2 both pro-fited tc  some extent by the practical exclusion of Australasiancompetition in wheat and meat,   The Australasian Dominions alonehave had no mitigation of their losses.   Yet, on the basis of direct damage only,  which the Treasury Memorandum seems toadeept as  reasonable,  they would get practically nothing at allin compensation either for their heavy direct expenditure or fortheir indirect losses.                 .&apos; .     Obviously then the British representatives on the allied commission must stand cut for total lose,  direct and indirectas the basis for the assessment and apportionment of the  indemnity-nity.   Total not loss is., however,  not quite the same thing astotal gross war expenditure.   All war expenditure is not  in an equal degree dead loss to the nation.   A million pounds expendedin the purchase of munitions abroad by means of a foreign loan isclearly a  much greater national burden than a. million poundsspent in the country,  stimulating industry, giving employment,and largely ooming back again through taxos and war loans,.   Thegreater part,  for instance,  of the. 660,000,000 whioh will havebeenraised by the Sxcess Profits Tax by the end of the financialyear and applied to the cost of the war,  has already figured inour previous war expenditure,  and i3 really a rebate on that expenditure,   The same applies in principle to the relation ofall our internal war expenditure to war taxation   It appliesno less to war loans in so far as they have come out cf warprofits.    As for the  1,800,000,000 of our advances to our allies and the Dominions, which were furnished,  in the main,  inthe shape  of  cods manufactured in this country,  these representthe export side of our war industry, and - unless repudiated -will eventually prove a highly profitable transaction.   In otherways, too, the war has involved /great expenditure on the  equip-ment of our manufacturing industries which will remain as a positive asset,     Here  again the ratio between ,gros3 expenditure and net lossvaries considerably as between the various belligerents.   Prance,.by reason  of having the war waged on her own territory,  has notonly suffered the greatest direct&quot; damage,  but aha8 also enjoyedthe greatest degree of indirect compensation.  By far thegreater part of her expenditure has been in her own territory,and has been supplemented by the vast sums with which theBritish, and latterly the American,  Armies have irrigated that territory.   At the other end of the scale stand Australia andFew Zealand whose expenditure has been mainly outside their territories, and which have enjoyed practically no speoial corn-pen sat ion  in the development of war industries,     To attempt to analyse the war expenditure and war losses of the various Allies, in order to ascertain the real net losssuffered by each, is beyond the scope of these hasty notes.   Buta rough analysis on the lines suggested need present no insupera-ble difficulties,   The resultant total,  whether it works out athalf, or two thirds or three quarters, of the gross war expendi-ture of the Allies,  is the sum which the Enemy Powers should becalled /
 upon to find, up to the limit of their capacity to do so, if our object really is reparation, and not malting a profit out of our victory.         Tht next question is that of the fore in which payment is to  e made.  Payment can be in money, in kind, or in territory. Of these three forms the last is one whose proper assessment is of supreme importance, if we are to secure a fair apportionment of the indemnity as between ourselves sad our Continental Allies. In the Report of Mr, Hughes&apos;s Committee this aspect of the indemnity question Is lext out ot. account entirely.   In the Treasury Memorandum it is dealt with, but in a very inadequate fashion, as if it were only a question of the Government assets in the territories transferred, or of those private assets which the new Government might decide to expropriate.   On this basis the Treasury Memorandum rechons the acquisition of Alsace-Lorraine by France as a possible off-set of at most  100,000,000 against the Indemnity due by Germany.         But there is really no justification for this arbitrary distinction between Government and private assets in the case of annexed territories.   Alsace-Lorraine was from the industrial and mining point of view one of the richest parts of the German Empire..  If the total wealth of Germans/assessed at  20,000,000,000 that of Alsace-Lorraine- paxi hardly be lest than.  1,000,000,000, And if Germany is capable of yielding a  20,000,000,000 indemnity, Alsace-Lorraine would, if left with Germany, be capable of yielding its proportionate share.  The measure of Germany&apos;s loss in losing Alsace-Lorraine is also the measure of Pranced pain.   As a source cf private and public revenue, as a market for.French goods - not to speak of the addition to French military man-power - Alsace-Lorraine is probably well worth , 1,000,000,000 to France at present prices.   If so it ought to be credited at that figure both to Germany&apos;s share of the total indemnity to be paid by the Central Powers, and to France&apos;s share in the receipt cf that indemnity.        In this particular instance the French will, no doubt, attemp to claim that the restoration of the lost provinces is merely psrt of the righting of the wrong done in 1871, and should be left out of account.,   But the wrong consisted not in the economic loss  to  France,  but in the moral injury done to the people of Alsace-Lorraine by annexing them against their will. Undoing that&apos; wrong does not affect the foet that France will now receive a great accession of wealth and economic strength.   There is no reason why  she should make that profit at the expense of the Allies who have assisted her in righting that wrong,  and have, in fact, -saved her from destruction - for that is what would be involved if in her claim to her full share in the indemnity ehe took no account of the v.:lue of Alsace-Lorraine./      The same applies to the territories which will  be taken from Austria-Hungary.   The- Trentino-, Trieste and Istria will represent a very&quot;substantial  off-set against Italy&apos;a  claims  to a money indemnity.   The YugoslfV provinces, vdth a population of 5,5C0,CC0,  and with considerable mineral and agricultural resources, can harday stand at a lose total valuation than  500,000,000. what ever the  figure it is large enough to justify bur treating it as more than sufficient to cover all Serbians claims  to restoration
 and  indemnity.    So,  too,  Rumanians claims  should be amply covered  by  the  increase  to her resources  involved in the acquisi- tion of  Bessarabia  and Transylvania.    whether  German Austria and a  reduced Hungary are capable of aoinr.  any  more than bearing the burden of thew-.ar debt of  the &apos;-vhole former  Austro-Hungarian&quot; Empire,  and whetherthe new Czecho-Slovak  Republic should bear any  portion of  that debt,  are questions of  detail rhich will have to be  worked out.   Bulgaria should be  capable  of pay.&apos;nc: at any rate an  apprec  able share  of money indemnity, even  if she loses n* territory.    &quot;hat  !s  left -of Turkey  is hardly likely to be able to  meet even the existing obligations  of the Ottoman Empire.       German colonies,  where directly  annexed  and  incorporated in the fiscal and economic system- of the  conquering state, &quot;.111 naturally have  to be  reckoned in on the game basis and credited to indemnity.    The same rule can, however, hardly be applied without  some modification  to German colonies or ex-Turkish territories  administered in a  mandatory  capacity by Powers vhich deliberately preclude themselves from taxin^ these territories in order to  relieve them cf their ovn war,debt, confirm^ their market to their  cm industries, or utilising their man-power to sup- complement  their own military res urces.   But  even if these territories are  credited to  indemnity  in the ordinary way,  the total co ing to the  British  Empire, or the assumption that  re retain South &apos; est Africa ,last  ..frica, the  Pacific Islands,  Palestine and kesopotamia, vill at  the  outside reach  the figure of  250- 35r,000,000*   This immense  difference  between the total money  value of small but closely  settled  and highly developed European territories, and vast but  backward areas, is one which it  is essential for us to insist on throughout, not  only in mitigation of the envy ^hich mi0ht  otherwise  be  excited by our rjreat territorial acquisitions, but  also  to  insure  fair treatment to ourselves  in respect of the indemnity.   The  inclusion of ceded enemy territories on any other basis  than that  of their full value in  the  assessment and appor- tionment  of  the  indemnity  would mean that the British Empire would receive&apos;far  loss  than its  just share of the remainder of the indemnity whether pa  d in kind or in money.       The total  amount of  indemnity  lvhich  can be paid in the immediate future, mainly in foreign assets, gold, ships and raw materials,  is estimated in the Treasury Memorandum at a maximum firure of  1,150,000,000.  It is possible,  in view of the present condition of Germany  and the need for setting her industries at work  amain, that this total cannot be  reached, and that even  1 *000,00*%000 may be an outside figure       As  regards  Germany^ capacity for making an annual payment over a  term of years  the Treasury memorandum concludes that no really substantial  payment can be secured unless we are prepared to :ive a soeclal stimulus to German exports, and, more oarticularly, to those  exports vhich most compete with our own. industries, and Unless we are to give Germany a preferential supply of the rawmaterials required for those exports.   The argument depends on the  assumption that Germany&apos;s pre-war exports were based directly on her pre-war imports of raw materials.       It  is  sufficient to analyse a single  instance, to see the economic  fallacy underlying that assumption..   In 1913 Germany imported  25,670,000 worth of wool and exported  29,400,000 worth of woollen goods.    Wow the argument of&apos;the Treasury  emorandum is that  the difference between these two amounts (which constitutes Germany1s capacity to pay her debt) could not be increased unless
Germany wore supplied with more row wool arid secured a markedfor a  corresponding increase in her sale of woollen roods.This would only bo true  if tho &quot;hole of the imported woolwere required to make the exported woollen ;oods.   The actualprocess Is, however, somewhat as follows:   23,670,000 of imported wool is worked  up into say  190,000,000 worth of vool-len ;oods, of which  90,000,000 are consumed in Germany and less than  30,000,000 exported.   In other words only about 6,000,000 of the imported v-ool ;.oes out again and  18,,000,COOis retained for borne consumetion.   If the Germans could reduce their domestic consumption by half - and they havedone with far less during tho war * the import of wool into Germany could be reduced by  9,000:000 without affectingGermany s export trade,  and Germany s capacity to pay wouldbe correspondingly Increased.          In other words the measure of what Germany can payannually is the measure  of the comforts and luxuries whichthe population of Germany has enjoyed in tho past and which,for a generation, it can afford to do without.   the doesnot necessarily involve  a ,-reat increase or oven any increaseof German exports.   But It does involve a drastic decreaseIn German imports, firstly of luxuries, secondly of food-stuffs, and thirdly of all that portion of her Import ofraw ^aterialc which has hitherto rone to meet the demandsof her domestic consumption.   It is not the province of thesenotes to attempt a calculation of the actual amount germany could be made to pay In  this way without driving, herpopulation below subsistence level.   But there is at anyrate fair ground for supposing that it will be considerably in excess of the  125,000,000 a year suggested in theTreasury ^enomr-dum, possibly even in excess of  250,0^0,000a year..          The present value of this latter figure, paid over30 years would be  3,800,000,000.   As a very rough guess,then, one mir.ht perhaps hazard the estimate that the HtaemyPowers could pay altogether, partly in tho immediate future,but mainly over a period of 30 years^ a total  in money orkind of say  5 - 6,000,000,000 over and above  cessions of territory of a  Value of another  4 - 5,000.,000,000,  or a gross total of   10,000,000,000 in all.   Assuming tho total net cost of the :&apos;?r to the Allies to be about  two thirds ofthe gross cost,  iic. about .n6,000,000,000, this would be equivalent to a composition at 12/6 in the pound, though asa rood deal of  the territorial indemnity .woulc&apos; ro to newstates like Poland, Czechoslovakia etc. the majdf *llioswould, as a matter of fact., get rather less than that.proportion.          The object of these notes,  however,  is not to attemptto arrive at definite figures,  for which much  more exhaustiveinvestigation is required, but to indicate the ruMing princi-ples which should be --opt in view in order to  protect Britishinterests in th3 settlement of this question.    To Sum up,these are;     (1)   that  the only fair basis of assessment and apportion-          merit  of indemnity le  the total not loss suffered by          tho -lilies collectively and individually;     (2)   that  in assessing :W a portioning the indemnity          -p^dod torritoric  should bo tehon Inte account at                full value j
(3)   that the payment of a substantial indemnity     spread over a period of years rood not involve an     increase of German competitive exports, but only     a severe limitation on Germany&apos;s internal con-     sump- t ion, in other &quot;/ords a prolongation, in a   .  modified form, of the conditions under which     Germany has been living during the wars25th December 1918,(Frgd)   h, e, Amery.
