It may be useful to  the Members of  the Imperial Y/ar  cabinet if they have a copy  of these Resolutions before them  at Friday&apos;sMeeting, and I therefore circulate them  in advance.   An explsnatiocan  then be given  of any of  them, or  a general statement made, if so desired.                             (signed)  Curzon of  edieston.19th December, 1918
