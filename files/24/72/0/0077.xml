G.T.6576

POST WAR POLICY FOR DEFENSIVE ARMAMENT OF MERCHANT VESSELS AND TRAWLERS.

Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.

With reference to the memoranda by the First Lord of the Admiralty and the Shipping Controller (Papers G.T. 6448 and 6565), the Board of Trade are in agreement with the policy of requiring all merchant ships when building to be stiffened for guns, and they further agree with the Shipping Controller that the best arrangement, both from the point of view of equity and of administrative convenience, would be to require the shipowner to pay the cost in the first instance.

A. H. STANLEY.

Board of Trade.

31st December, 1918.
