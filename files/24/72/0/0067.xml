They have put for-   ward&apos;an. application to the Treasury for %^ sanction to  the general  principles of the Scheme, and-the following provisional estimate of  cost has.also been submitted.  -      -        &apos;    (1) 10 scholarships of  175  per annum and fees        6000    (2) 150 allowances of  125 per annum for 2 years.    37500    (3) Maintenance allowances of  24 per annum for          children..................................   ^JlgS                                                       46600,V.  STOLUS OOVSRHIEHT PROPERTY.          Tho Board are at present in communication with the  Surplus   Government Property Advisory Council regarding the  possibility   of lands, buildings and stores, that have  on account  of the   cessation of hostilities become surplus to the requirements  of   certain Government Departments, being made available  for agrioul-   :tural purposes in Scotland,          The following considerations have been laid  before  the   Council:-     1. &quot; andJjttlejnent,  3)urln,-v the past 4 years the  normal  land   settlement&quot;&quot;oyeraTiVas of the  Board under their existing statutory   powers have been greatly curtailed owin^ to the  scarcity and   oxceesivc cost of building and other materials.   This  work  will   have to be resumed at an early date and there are in  addition   the large Bohemes already referred to in connection with the   settlement of ex-service  men  under the Small Holding  Colonies   Act.   Large quantities ofc material will be required  for build-   rings, steadings and fences,  and it has occurred to the  Board   that a considerable proportion of the material used- in  the equip-   rment of military camps throughout the country would  be  eminently   suitable  *f or this purpose,     8\  l&amp;J*h Z^P$0?S -  5he  Kwl Transport Committee  appointed   oy /
by tho Secretary for Scotland to inquire into the wholequestion of rural transport in Scotland have in advanoc of thepublication of their Report submitted an estimate of rails and rolling stock, etc. that may be required in connection with the Iconstruction of rural railways in Scotland.   As the Department!interested in the Committees&apos; recommendations the Board have written in support of their application.  3.  farmers.&apos;; Reouirements,  individual farmers and. agriculturalassociations &quot;have aTread&quot;y&apos;approached the Board on tho subjectof these surplus materials, particularly corrugated iron and.fsnoing wire, being offered to farmers at reasonable terms.        The Beard h&amp;ve recommended that after the requirements&apos; ofthe Board&apos;s schemes have beonmet the agricultural community inScotland should have nest claim.        Tho Board havo inforaed tho Council that they are strong]6f opinion that .schemes initiated by the Government should haveabsolute priority and that olaims of private individuals-should only be considered after the needs of these schemes have been met
