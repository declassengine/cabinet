Reply by the Chairman of the Committee (Mr. Leslie Scott) tc the      Memorandum of the Local Government Board (G.T. 6501) submitted to      the War Cabinet by the President of the Local Government Board cn      the 18th December, 1913.1,         I have given careful consideration to the  Local Government     Board Memorandum, and submit  the  following  comments.2.         I observe the Local Government Board  agree vrith my     Committee -           (a) that a uniform system is  desirable (Memo.  para.  1);  and           (b) that the grant of powers  to acquire  particular  land               cannot be divorced  from a consideration  of the  merits               of the whole undertaking.  (Memo, para,  5),3,         This latter aspect of the problem is  cardinal.    It was     for this reason that my Committee were unanimous in  the view     that whatever machinery we advised  must be  suitable  for disposing     of all the business involved  in local legislation, whether     involving the acquisition of  land or not,    (Report  paras. 95  &amp;     96).   We were thus driven to consider the  wider problem,  in     spite of our limited reference.hyCompulsory powers for the acquisition of land are required(a) Private undertakers (mostly for commercial purposes).  %4            (b) Government Departments.            (c) Local Authorities.  5 ,         Private Undertakers.            The commercial, agricultural and mineral development  of      the country will be greatly facilitated if there is  a simple,      cheap and quick procedure for obtaining a grant of compulsory      powers for acquiring land whenever such a grant is in the      public interest,   But on applications for such purposes,      questions of policy will frequently arise, and over  these my      Committee think that Parliament  should keep control.    This object      will be attained if the Sanctioning Authority we propose is\]%    created, viz: a sub-committee of b*Uh Houses (with added ncn-      Parliamentary members),&apos; and an appeal on matters of  principle  to      Parliament itself, although we do  not anticipate many such  appeals      in practice.
      It is most satisfactory to note that under this head,the proposals of my Committee have the approval of the LocalGovernment Board - &quot;if the report is adopted so far as companies,and persons other than local authorities are concerned, as itprobably should be.,.&quot; (Memo. para d).      Gov eminent Department s.      The Local Government Board Memorandum does not purport tcdiscuss this question.   In para. 2 they say that the main question from/Local Government Board point cf view is Whethers(q far as Local Authorities are concerned, it is better toextend the Provisional and Departmental Orders system as suggested hy the Murray Committee, or to. set up the new procedure suggested by the Leslie Scott  Committee&quot;.      Ky Committee in paras. 19 to 22 of its Report expressed a reasoned opinion against the system of Departmental orders, and I need add little.      Where a Department of State has already heon entrusted byParliament with certain duties, the due performance of whichnecessitates the compulsory acquisition of land, the decision asto whoso land shall be taken is, to some extent, of a judicialcharacter.   Obviously, it cannot be entrusted to the Departmentitself.   Some independent authority must decide.   A fortiori is this the case where the Department is seeking new powers,Tor sucha case involves the exercise of legislative, as well as of judicial functions.      In my view, one of the chief constitutional dangers to beguarded against In the future  is an undue growth of bureaucraticpower in the hands of the Executive, exercised through theDepartments of State&quot;.   This is the chief lesson taugh/,&apos;us byD.O.R.A.   There is only one safeguard - the maintenance of efficient Parliamentary control.   Ky Sanctioning Authority, if adopted, will ensure it.      I understand that the Committee on Governments presided overhy Lord Haldane, which has just reported, holds a similar view, viz:that as the activities of Government Departments increase, aconcomitant extension of Parliamentary control over their administration is essential.      Local Authorities.      Even under this third head the L^cal Government Board approvesof half the proposals of my Committee.   The memorandum concedesthat for &quot;purposes which have heretofore formed the subjects of bills for Local Acts&quot; the Sanctioning Authority might appro-appropriately take over the powers of Parliament.      It is only in regard t* the system of Departmental Orders thatthe Local Government Board part company from my Committee,   Herethey take up-the position that wherever a Local Authority seeks toacquire land for any purpose for which a Local Authority canacquire land under the general law, the procedure by DepartmentalOrder should be used.      My Committee gave careful attention to this possible solution, but were unanimous in rejecting it.   Their reasonswere set forth in paras, 15 to 22 of the Report.   In addition I-2 -
  would  say  -        (u)  Local Authorities dislike the system;        (b)  The absence  cf Publicity, the possibility of the            Department consciously or unconsciously, but in secret            enforcing particular views or principles of its own;            and the  impossibility of know ing who i&amp;i really            responsible  for  the decision - all these are factors in            the public distrust of the system.ii which undoubtedly            exists to-day..        In further answer tr  the F^ard&apos;s criticism in this  context, I draw particular  attention to my Committee&apos;s  proposal/in para. 66 of the Report, that &quot;wherever land sought  t** be  acquired by a Local Authority is within that Authority&apos;s own  area,  and  is needed for the purpose of statutory duties or powers  already existing, sanction  should not be required from the  Sanctioning Authority (i.e. the Local Authority can acquire by  simple resolution) unless the owner alleges that otner land  can and ought to be found,  or that the powers of the Local  Authority are not being judicially exercised.&apos;&apos;        This extension of their powers should be of great value  to Local Authorities; and,  I submit, entirely disposes of the  suggestion of delay made by the L.G.B. in para. 7 of their  Memorandum.        The power of punishing improper *v even unsuccessful  objections by costs will prevent the misuse of the protecting  provisos-contained in&apos;the above recommendation.        The fundamental ground of my Report was the fact that the  ordinary Parliamentary  Committee commands public confidence.  The objections to the Parliamentary method have been expense and  delay.   The proposed Sanctioning Authority preserves the  essencej whilst getting  rid of the formalities.   At the same  time,  it permits a devolution of Parliamentary functions,  capable of wide extension,  which should assist materially in  reducing the congestion of business in Parliament itself.        The suggestion of  the L.G.B. (Memo, paras. 4 k 3) that  a sub-coroittee of Parliament re-appointed each session can  degenerate into a Standing Committee, as if its personnel were  paid functionaries holding appointments Is not intelligible to  me.    Nor is their criticism of my Committee (in para. 4) that  we do  not recognise the value of precedents in the wise  discharge of judicial functions.   Vhat we deprecated was an  undue -adherence to precedent in the discharge of - legislative  functions by the Authority entrusted with the sanctioning of  local  legislation, or the acquisition of land for industrial,  agricultural or mineral development.   We did not dispute  the propriety of entrusting certain types of semi,-judicial  work to a Standing committee proposed, but ^ur view is that neither  judicial nor legislative functions should be entrusted to a  Government Department.        An extension rather than a relaxation of Parliamentary  critic ism and control over Government Departments is needed toincrease,, their efficiency, particularly in view of the probable  extension of their activities in new fields during the ensuing  years  of HeconstructIon.   Publicity is the essence of  efficient administration.   If, as proposed b; my Committee,  the officials- cf the Department concerned could come as of
right before the Sanctioninp; Authority in order to state the considered opinion of the Department, it would disarm public criticism by demonstrating the care and thorougtose-ss of theDepartment&apos;s consideration of the case; and also, encourage the officials to embark boldly qn ens true live measures rather \&amp;air as,is some tines the cane to-day, to seek safety from parliamentary criticism - which is often uninformed - by adhering closely toprededent.   Under the procedure proposed, every scheme would automatically.be submitted in advance to the Department concerned,and&quot;&quot;the Sanctioning Authority would have the expert assistancefrom the representative of the Department as a witness.   On anyquestion of policy, the Department would be able to appeal as of right ^o Parliament which could recommit the measure to a SelectCommittee,      Even in these cases where to-day a Department has a finaldiscretion - e,g, land for small holdings - more public confidencewould exist, and the Department itself would, in the long -run,be in a stronger position if the independent SanctioningAuthority recommenced by my Committee were adopted,      Hy Committee has now reported on the assessment ofcompensation and cognate matters; am\ in this Heport proposesto abolish the Hands Clauses Acts altogether, and to entrust the assessment in disputed cases to a Tribunal appointed byand subject to, rules of procedure settled by the SanctioningAuthority.   It also proposes to utilise the SanctioningAuthority for many purposes in connection with compensation,particularly In regard to Betterment and Injurious Affection.      Mining Questions,      My Committee has been specially strengthened hy theaddition of distinguished representatives of the MiningIndustry, viz;      Of the above, the last three were Chairman and Membersof the Coal Conservation Committee and Mining Sub-Committee,(Sec Heport Cu,9084)      tr*e are now engaged On a special reference which Includesmany questions affecting.                     -      (a)  the Mineral Development of the United Kingdom, and      (b )  the Law of Support.Ve have not yet reported, but we are all agreed that theSanctioning Authority proposed in the first Keport of my committee will,be eminently suitable for dealing with anumber of most important questions under both the above heads;and are, accordingly baste our proposals upon it.      Water Queations.      Ply Committee heave yet to deal with various water questions,the conservation of sources of supply affecting riparian and-otherrights etc/, and from what I know of their views, I am satisfiedthat they will desire to utilize the Sanctioning Authority-4-
and its procedure for the adjustment of the many difficult questions of water conservation and supply throughout theUnited Kingdom,   I have discussed this aspect with Sir JohnSnell, the Chairman of the Water Power Committee, and havemade arrangements with him for the co-operation of our two Committee      FINAL.   For the above reasons, I strongly urge that aBill should be drafted for immediate introduction embodying the proposals of my Committee,   In order to facilitate the transition from the existing- multiplicity of systems, itmay.be desirable to provide for the new provisions cominginto force on different appointed days, to be fixed hereafterby Order in Council,   By this means the system of DepartmentalOrders might continue to be utilised as a temporary expedient.
