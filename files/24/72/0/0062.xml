t71 ,L^c:ument is     Property of        &quot;&apos;&apos;Jc (VJaJesty&apos;8 Government(I    27PitlSOHEKS OF ;/Aiu  0        4?)                      mm\&amp;m\M  by  the  home   secretary,HALL      There are two urgent matters  connected with the  repatriation  of british prisoners of war upon vrhioh I should like  to have the  directions  of the V?war cabinet .      (l) A large number of British prisoners of  v;ar,  probably  about 24,000are ready tc be repatriated  from Hamburg  and Bremerhaven as  soon as shipping is available to bring them away.    One  transport  (the  &quot;Poona&quot;)  has made ajourney to Hamburg for thio purpose and is returning &quot;ith about 1,500prisonero.   She oan make other journeys;   but unless  more  ships  can befound it will take a long time to repatriate these  prisoners, und the position at some of the OampB is critical.    No  more British tonnage can be found; but some German ships are available at  Hamburg and these ships, or  so many of them as may be allotted to this country  o*uld bring these prisoners  over quicklywith German crews under a British guard.    The Admiralty think  it preferable that the prisoners should bo brought here  in British ships, and of course this would be so if tonnage were  availablei  but  the condition  cf these prisoners is such that immediate  steps  are necessary,  and,  in the circum-stanoes I ask the Cabinet to direct that these ships or  so  many of them asmay be allotted to Great Britain shall  be  made available at   once for thetransport of prisoners of war.      (2) There appears to be Borne  delay in getting the  prisoners from certain camps to the Baltic ports at which they can be embarked on british vessels, nr to Holland.   It appears from  the records  cf the Ocnferenoe atSpa that the German delegates say that  no  rolling-stock  is  available for thispurpose.and suggest that part of  the rolling-stock which has  been deliveredor is to be delivered to the Allies under  the terms cf the  Armistice shouldbe used for the purpose of taking supplies and medioal comforts to the prisoners still in Germany and of bringing the prisoners away.    This may possibly be a device for obtaining  the  return of  seme  cf this rolling-stock,but General Adye (who is watching the interests of  the British  prisoners atSpa) does not hold that view and  recommends that  the suggestion be adopted.The representatives of all the Allies who  are dealing  at Berlin with thequestion of repatriation of prisoners of war, take  the same view.   As thispropesal affects the Armistice terms. I apprehend that it must  come beforethe Cabinet J  and 1 request the Cabinet to give directions  accordingly.                                             CAVE.                                               26th December, 1918.
