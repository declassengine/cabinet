Admiralty Mohprandum for tho                             WAR OABINCT.          Tho Admiralty consider it necessary that  tho  War Cabinet should now docido tho  standard upon which  tho  post war reserves of oil fuol for tho British Navy in Hone  Waters should be maintained and in this connection desire to  put forward the following observations-          The Wavy is now dependent upon tho goodwill of tho United States of America for its vital supplies of oil fuel and this dependence must continue  unless and until alternative supplies can bo dove lope (L          During the war no less than 80$ of our oil fuel has been drawn from the IT. S. A- direct  or from Mexico and Trinidad Which are stragetically dominated ly tho U. S. A.          At one period  of the War  the  position  became  extremely critical and was only savod by  the utilisation  of  double bottoms (at the oxponso of other necessary supplies)  and by the goodwill of the U-S.A.          So far as can  at present  bo foreseen thero aro only two sources of supply which might  bo sufficiently  developed tooovor any large proportion of our Naval  requirements-   Those arc    1*   Homo Pr o duct ion .    2.   Tho Persian and  Mesopotamian Oilfield-          Supplies  now available or likely to  be  available from any othor sources  are so deficient either  in  quantity  or in quality that they  may be regarded  as negligible.          The possibilities of Homo production aro  dependent upon tho carbonisation  of  coal on a  groat scale  and  on  tho  result of the boring operations now being carried out by Lord Cowdray on behalf of the Government.          The output from the first of tho so can, in any case, only be  developed  gradually over a long period  of  years? while the rosult of the  borings is at present quite problematical.          The ultimate production of the Persian and Mesopotamian Oilfiold may bo very largo but  it  must  take years  to dovolop. Supplies havo to corao by a long and difficult soa  route and oven if a pipe line is  constructed to a Syrian  Port  it  will always be vulnerable and  transport through tho Mediterranean may be hazardous.          We have therefore to visible moans of &quot;avoiding absolute dependence on tho  U*S. A*  for vital supplies of  Naval oil fuel except by providing adequate storage and maintaining largo post-war reserve stocks.&apos;hc iSrndralty
         Tho Admiralty a::-7 of opinion that tho niniummreserve which it is safo to provide should bo 13 monthsconsumption on a war basis-   It is not possiMo to furnishacour ate figures until tho futv.ro standard of tho Navy isdocided on but on tho assumption that tho strerigth of thepost-war Navy may bo four-fifths that of the pro-war Navy,12 months war reserve, would be 4,500,000 tons.         Tho prosont storage capacity completed&apos;or completingis 1,750,000 tons so that on the abovo assumption additionalstorage for 2,750,000 tons would bo required.  This would cost  1 por ton or probably rather loss.         Tho expenditure though largo would be spread over aconsiderable period and is relatively negligible when it isremembered that the mobility of the British Navy is dependentupon it and that all other measures for the defence of&quot;thoEmplro may bo rendered nugatory, if oil fuel is not available and is known not to bo available at moments of diplomaticpressure^(Sd.)
