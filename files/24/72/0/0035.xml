[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]    1^printed for the War Cabinet.  December 1918.r,  CONTIOEXTiAL5^ALL GKv;:&apos;I CIRCULATE the following for the consideration of the Cabinet.L W. E,LEAVE OR HOME SERVICE FOR 1914 MEN.      I HAVE had  many strong representations made on behalf of men in the old  army who went abroad in 1914  that they should  be sent  back for a long leave  or for home service.      As an example, a married man went out in  1914, since  when he has had  ten days&apos; and fourteen days&apos; home leave, and this is now his fifth winter in France.      I suggest that a public  announcement should  be made that such men should  be given at least a month&apos;s leave, and  that as many as possible should be transferred&quot;to home service.L. W. E.December 1$, 1918.
