[IS jOC&amp;ffE^ 15 THE PROPERTY OF HIQRITAMIC MAJESTY -s&apos; GO vtilR^ENlhj B C JLILX: IG.T ,6 512 .   I &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;IMPERIAL  WAR OABiKET.,RESOLUTIONS Oil THE^OAUCASUS,,AID ARMENIA. 1.   We  desire  to  see  strong  independent States - offshoots, of the  former Russian  Empire  -  in the Caucasus. 2,   Of  these States Georgia  is the most advanced and has the strongest  claims  to early  recognition. 3.   Recognition of  the  remaining States, viz. Daghestan, Azerbaijan, and Russian Armenia,  must depend on the march Qf events  and their  successful  assertion of an autonomous existence 4,   Whether Russian Armenia  shall have a separate existence (as  distinct from Turkish  Armenia) will he determined in the main by  the attitude  of the  people themselves, 5,   Whether the independent  States cf the Cauoasus combine hereafter  in a Federation  or prefer to remain separate is a matter  for their  own  determination. 6,   Similarly their relations to the present or future Govern-&apos; merit of  Governments of  Russia is a matter that in the main noneeras themselves. 7.   If it  be decided  at the peace Conference,  either as the result of  a request from the States or at the instance of the League of  Nations (should  such be set up)  that the services of a Great Power are required for a period to protect international interests  in the  areas  concerned, the selection of America would, be preferable to  that  of France, but is not in itself desirable.  The selection  of France would on broad grounds of policy and strategy be  undesirable,  only in the last resort and  reluctantly if  pressed to do so,  might Great Britain pro- visionally accept the task. 8.   In any aase we  have no intention of annexing any of these territories or converting  them into a British Protectorate, or cf accepting any commitments which will involve the per- manent maintenance  of large British forces in the Caucasus. 9.  It is  important for the time  being to maintain British Naval control of  the Caspian- 10.  The ultimate settlement should provide if possible for the declaration as  Free Ports of  3aturn,  Poti,  Trebizond,  andBaku, and  for free  transit on the railway ixom Batum to Baku,11.  Special steps may  require to be  taken for the due safe- guarding of international interests in the oity and oil-fields of Baku.
12.  In the re-constituti on  of Georgia, it will  be  dr;-nir?.tbLeto include within ito bound-tries the ILc-alexi /Jeoicsjiaris  ofBatum and Lazistan.1?.  If an independent Armenian State be constituted out  of either the eix Armenian vilayets or a smaller area, and  if aGreat Power be called upon either by the League  of  Nations orby the people themselves  to  act as protector to  the new  State,Great Britain should refrain from advancing any  clains,  andshould support the cane either of America or Prance; prefer-ably, in the interests of a  revision of the Sylces-picotAgreement of 1916, of prance.
