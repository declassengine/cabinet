But as    the  article in the &quot;Daily NewB&quot; accuses ne of &quot;surprising    ignorance&quot;, and  calls my letter a &quot;tissue of half-truths and    complete mis-statements&quot;,  I think that my colleagues, some of    Ytfioni may not have had the same  opportunities that 1 have had    of following closely the course of military events in Russia-    are  entitled to  see the answer  that I am able tc make to these    accusations. ,              I maintain all my assertions, and I think that anyone    who  will do me the&quot; favour to look through this paper, will    see  that the &quot;surprising ignorance&quot; is on the side of my    critic.

Examination01ord Hilner&apos;6  Case  for  Intervention.(Daily News,  23rd Dec.  1918.)    Lord I,Iilner!s letter in defence  the  Allies1  policy in Russia hasttracted so  much attention,  and isUll &quot;being  so  v/idely discussed thatt  may  he useful to examine it  pointy  point in  the light of the latestuthoritative information that  haseached this  country.   Lord minereclares that his correspondent hasisapprehended  the facts of the case  well as the  motives of thedvernment.It       will  not he  difficult  toiow  that  Lord Lllner  is himselfurprisingly  ignorant  of the realtate of affairs,  and  would find ita.rd,  to say  the least, to  squareiQ Government&apos;s alleged principlesith  their undoubted practice.    Lord milner  begins by aphasiaing the fact that the aterventionist expedition in Russia onsists of Allied, not merely British orces - &quot;indeed, the British are illy a small proportion of the total Hied troops :.    The words are accurate, the aplication completely misleading^ he Archangel expedition is under ritish command, and the vihole affairs oth there and en the Murmansk coaft as been run entirely by tfce British,.le fact that American, and other troops ppened to be mhe most readily radlable does not alter the essential haraater of the undertaking.   lord Milner  says  that  the  reason or  sending  the expedition  was  that  &quot;theIshevists  were....assisting ournemies in every possible way&quot;.  &apos;   Vih ere is  the  evidence?.Comment     Intervention in&quot;north russia was recommended by theSupreme War Council at versailles, on which the fourprincipal Allies have equalrepresentation.     In order to ensure unity of control it was necessary to entrust the command of the expedition to one or other of the Allies.  As theundertaking involved in thefirst instance a Naval andMilitary expedition from aBritish base, it was natural that this expedition should beentrusted to a British Commander.Moreover this criticism entirelyignores the Allied intervention in Siberia.  The Allied Troops in siberia, which are under Japaneseor French command,  number some72,000 of which 2 to 3200 only-are British.  They are 3 times asnumerous as the Allied forcesin North Russian, of which about half arc British.     The Foreign Office havea nunber of Consular and otherreports which could with great advantage be published.AsIf
Examination offcilhcrfs Case for Intervention [C/ntd)Comment.   If  this is a fact  why has  it  &quot;been proved &quot;by the  publication  of  reports of our consular  agents Russia?.   Have reports been  asked    Have they been furnished?.&quot;   If y have been furnished, where are they? re is Mr.Lockhart&apos;s  report?. Where  is young1s report from  Archangel?.  If se reports are not published, the sumption  is that  they would  condemn the eyes  of the world either the ion of  the British Government or the ion of  the British Government&apos; Bante.   It  would be  well for ticisra  to concentrate upon this nt of  a demand for the production the evidence  upon  which the eminent decided to act, and  also subsequent consular reports.of    Lord jfilner says  it  waslung to  the Bolehevii betrayallat  Rumania fell into the hands  the  Germans.    That statement  can best beswered  by  citing dates.

Here weave at least one provable pointpon which Lord Milner is convicted? gross  ignorance.      As an instance,  cne out    many,  I might call attention to a report by lb?.Pros ton (H.M.Consol at Ekaterinburg) illustrating very forcibly -     (a) the methods ef barbari          practiced by the          Bolsheviks,     (b) their hostility to the          Czechs.     (c) their co-operation          with the  Germans.      I  perfectly  remeaber the 3.of State for Foreign Affairs stating to the Cabinet that, while he  was not prepared to say the Bolsheviks wanted to help the  Germans,  their action had been  consistently of assistance to the  Germans and of  the  greatest injury to the Allies.   He  supported this by  a no.  of  illustrations, such as their dealings with the Russian  fleet,  their condust towards Roumania,  etc., none of which were or can be controverted.      Rumania  was not  completely defeated  by December,  1916, She  had lost  Wallachia and the  principal  oil  fields  buther  Government  and Army retired into Moldavia.. Incessant  fighting tookplace during  January  1917, the Rumanians having  6f*division  in the front  linewhile the  rest  of  the army was being  re-organized  under General Berthelot1s supervision.     0n July  24th, 1917. the human!an&quot;&quot;Seoonct Army begunan offensive  in conjunctionwith the 4th  Russian Armybut owing  to  the Russianretreat the Rumanianoffensive  was brought toa standstill  on the 27thJuly.     5,3:0111  August, 9th to themiddle of  September thebitterest  fighting tookplace in the  neighbourhoodof Marasesti  and thanks tothe bravery of the Rumaniantroops Mackensen&apos;s army was repulsed  with very heavy losses, at that timethe -Romanian  Army consisted of
 Oase  of the Czecho-Slovaks. Lord  Milner father  says:- &quot;The  Czecho-Slovaks  were  savedidestruction&quot;. The Bolshevik  contention  was! the Czecho-Slovaks had possessed elves of  arms  which  were  theerty of  Russia, and,  therefore.he de  facto  Government of  Russia.hey would  give  up  these arms would be  in no danger ofruction, but vrould oe at livertyeturn  to their  homes.of 15 divisions.     By November, 1917.Rumania had.increased her Army to 18 divisionswith a combatant strength of 284,6^0men.  It was in this month that the spread of Bolshevism in the russian army led to its complete demoralisa-tion and owing to the fact that theRussian troops acting in conjunctionwith the Rumanian Army refused toremain in the trenches or fight,the Rumanian High Command was forcedOn the 6th December to associateitself with the Russian Command inthe proposal of an armistice andhostilities were suspended.  Atthis time the possibility of with-drawing the&apos; Roumanian Army throughBessarabia and the Ukraine to the black Sea was considered, but owing to the increasing hostilitybetween Russia and Rumania, dueto the Bolsheviks insisting onthe disarmament of the Russian troops the proposal was necessarilyabandoned.  Hatters grew worse andRumania was forced to send 4 Division(including 2 Cavalry Divisions)to Bessarabia to maintain order.Frequent encounters took place and on the 28th January, I918, theRussian Bolshevist Governmentbroke off relations with Rumania andsequestered the Rumanian Goldreserve at Moscow.     Marshal flackensen took advantageof this situation and on the 1stMbruary invited the RumanianGovernment to send parlementairesto Focsani.  On the 3rd February theywere given 4 days within which to engage on peace negotiations.     On the ?th February pea*e waBsigned between the Ukraine and theCentral Powers and on the same dayMarshal Mackensen was inf oimed thata new Rumanian Cabinet was being formed to open peace negotiations.     (l) The Czechs obtained, their arms from 3 sources     (a) Many of them had beenissued with anas on being organizedinto formations to fight with theRussians against the Germansbefore the Bolshevik betrayal.     (b) By purchase fromdispersed Russian soldiery.     (c) By collecting materialabandoned by Ruselans at the(2)front
1 1(2)  It is necessary in this matter p&apos;f the Czech-Slovaks to try to &quot;grasp the significance of the  conclusions which the Bolsheviks  not unnaturally drew from a combina-  tion cf events.  They linked  ogether three occurrenoea:-  1) The Czecho-Slovak rising in the  Sast; Cid) the Allied operations  in the North; (iii) the counter-  revolutionary outbreaks at  Jaroslav and elsewhere.  Thia,they  said, is obviously a plot to seize  the main lines of coianumicaion  with Petrograd.  There was evidence  that the three movements were  intended to synchronise.  It is not  a matter of surprise that,  as the  only Government existing in the  country,  they took action to prevent  the Got eminent * 8 overthrow.352front; materialotherwise havehands. which wouldfallen into German     The Bolsheviks were prepared to Ilet the Czechs return to their homes,!only if they would first layd down their arms.     To have done so, would haveamounted to suicide on the part ofthe Czechs, as even if the bolshevikoffer were sincere,  the Bolshevik:leaders haa at that  time ve^y littlecontrol over their soldiery.way(2) The 3 incidents were in notimed to synchronise.  ..     The first collisions &quot;betweenthe Chechs and the Bolsheviks in eastern Siberia occurred in May1918.  Largely as a result of theBolshevik attitude towards the Czechsthe Allies landed at Hurman on June23rd.     A British naval detachmenthad been already landed early in lay.     The anti-Bolshevik outbreakat Yaroslav occurred on the 2nd July,The Allies had no knowledge of the intentions of the leaders of themovement, whose action, from the joinof view of the prospects of success,was undoubtedly premature.The Military Stores.      Lord Milner says that enormous quantities of military stores belonging to the Allies and lying at Archangel and Vladivostok were &quot;being  appropriated by the Bolsheviks  for the benefit of Germany.      AB  a matter of fact the  tores at Archangel were irretr i ev- ably lost before the archangel landing.. The moment the Bolsheviks &quot;smelt a rat&quot; they cleared everything off.  liatever may have happened at Vladivostok,  the Allied troops certainly did not. as lord Milner claims wput an end to the process&quot; at  Archangel,  because by the time they arrived  there was nothing toI put an end  to.  Lord Milner declaresMat these  stores were being^transferred  to the GenaansS   Let Him prove it.   The Bolsheviks deny it  emphatically,  declaring that the metal was needed to rehabilitate Russian  Industries*     It is possible that owing tothe disorganization and mismanage-ment of the Railways by theBolBheviks no very large quantityof stores actually reached theGermans, but there is every reason zip believe the reports received from the 3ritish officials at Archangel that the removalwas arranged by the Germans andfor the Germans.     As regards the statement thatthe process of removal had beencompleted prior to the Alliedlanding the following is an extractfrom a notice posted at Archangelby the Bolshevik&quot; CommissaryDelegate&quot; on or about June 22nd1918.     &quot;In view of the international and political situation thepresence of a foreign vessel of ,war, especially with, an armed crew,at Archangel where \there areimmense quantiUes of war material and explosives, v/111 be regardedaa the beginning oi aotireoperations.....&quot;                         This
m      Lord Milner says that  as a I result  of our intervention  tta vast  portion of the earthTs  surface ;and millions  of people  friendly I to the  Allies have &quot;been spared the  unspeakable horrors of  Bolshevik  rule.,n      (1) It is really difficult to If a thorn what this is intended to [mean.  What has happened as the fresult  of intervention  is that a Ifew square miles of territory at  Archangel have been cut off from. Ithe rest of Russia, and Bolshevism lin the rest of the country - l&quot;a vast portion of the  earth&apos;s suif If ace&quot; - has been given  the tremendous  impetus that must always result in I such cases fro:: foreign attack. 1(2)  As for &quot;the unspeakable horrors lof Bolshevik rule&quot;, is lord Hilner I aware that anything from 100 to 150 British subject are living peaceably in Moscow of  their own. I choice,  and are not exposed to any I hardships other than tfaose endured ... [by the rest of the population?. True,  the Bolsheviks have killed lone British official,  Captain Orombie, but if he could Bpeak today he would probably say that I he knew he waa playing a dangerous I game and was ready to pay the * - price.                        -  &apos;     Lord Milner says that in thecourse of the Allied interventionthousands of Russians have taken uparms and fought on the side of the(Allies .     ThiB is simply not true. Alarge number of Russians have certainly &quot;taken up arms&quot; i.e.fJmt on the uniform of one or other of the Allied forces, but theyhave not fought.  It may be                       doubted      This from  the Bolshevik representative  speaks for itself, Moreover the  critic  entirely gives the^o-by to the much greater. quantity of stores at Vladivostock.      (l) Had  it not  been for the Allied intervention  in St Russia, followed by similar  action in Siberia, the  whole of the latter country would have inevitably been  over-run by the Bolsheviks.      The area of Siberia is 4,832,000 sq. miles  with a population of about  14 million.      The area actually protected by the Allied troops in Archangel and Iviurniansk  is some 40,000 sq.miles.      (2)  The fact that all theNeutral States have found itnecessary to break off relationswith  the Bolsheviks as a protest against the reign of terrorwhich the Bolsheviks exerciseat i&quot;oscew is sufficient answer-to the writer1 s observations.      figures are notavailable as to the effects ofthe Bolshevik terror on thepopulation of Moscow, but thatof Petrograd has been reduced from  2J- Billion to between800,000 and 1 million.      Some insight into theconditions endured by txhepopulation of Moscow, can begathered from the attached extractfor a Lecture by Mr. Killerof the British Labour Party,who returned from Russia aboutOctober last after 15 monthsspent in travel and study inthat  country. (See appendix A).     In the Archangel and murmansk regions some 6,000Russians, Karelians and Finnshave taken up arms and Joined theAllied forces.  The Karelians have themselves reconquered their own country.  This allegationmoreover, is stultified by a consideration of the situation on the Eastern Bolshevik fro-nt.Here a line, some $00 miles longas the crow flies, from the                  neighbourhood

Is not that a sufficienti^lanation ?.The German Menace.   lord Milner says:- &quot;Inter-ntion were successful V.  *e resources of Siberia and Southstern Russia was denied to thepmyo   Tile northern ports ofiropean Russia were preventedpm becoming &quot;bases for German^marines.M On the first point, the German    was dead by &quot;the middle of?7&quot;&quot;Ue. some weeks before theiliangel landinga  It is highly,.rob able that there were any man troops at the bedimingAugust within don miles ofhangel. On the second point, couldhangel, a port that is ice-lad for eight months out oiry twelve, ever have become effective IKboat base ?.  Other point could be taken, enough has been said to showneighbourhood of Perm to Orenburg,is held almost exclusively by russian and Siberian troops whohave mobilised themselves and aresuccessfully defending theriches of Siberia against the attack of 5 Bolshevik Armiestotalling some 112,000 men.     further, is the NorthCaucasia and on the Don, somelfOjOOO Russians, organised bythe late General Alexiev, have consistently adhered to theAllied cause and have held theirown against the Bolsheviks,although completely isolated fromall external assistance untilthe opening of the Black Seaafter the Armistice with Turkey.Through this long period thesemen have not received a riflea great-coat or any army rationfrom Allied sources, but theypinned their faith on. the successof the Allied Amies, and trustedthe honour of the Allies toprotect them ultimately againstBolshevik aggression.-      (l) The withdrawal of german divisions from the Eastern tothe Western front completelystopped for 3 months as from thedate  of the Allied landing at archangel, a fact which contributedvery materially to the Alliedvictory in the Westo  In theperiod between the accession of the Bolsheviks to power andthe said landing, no fewer than 48divisions had been transferred from  the Russian to the Westernfronts      (2) :;urman and Petchenga are both  fC(v-free ports and it isknown &quot;mat the Germans contemplatedobtaining possession of oneor &quot;both of them for use assubmarine bases *  This wasone of the chief aims of theGerman expedition to Finland,which failed in itB object mainlyowing to the Allied occupationof the Murman railway.
