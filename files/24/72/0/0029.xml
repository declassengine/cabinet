THE  COVENTRY ORDNANCE WORKS  LIMITED,                              3,  Central Buildings,                                   Westminster,                                          London,  S.W.1,                                13th  P?december,  1918The Secretary,     War Cabinet,        2,  Whitehall Gardens.     Sir,6057 .       I have the honour to refer to my letter of October 14th/     in which I  ashed what policy the Government intended to adopt     in regard to private armament firms after the War.  It was     pointed out that firms like the Coventry ordnance Works, which     are engaged almost exclusively on armament work both naval and  .  military, are placed in a position of great difficulty until     they knew what policy t&amp;e Government intend to adopt, and that    they are precluded from formulating a definite reconstruction    programme so long as a state of uncertainty exists.         My letter was acknowledged on October 23rd,  but we still     await enlightenment as to the Government5 s -policy.         We are told to cease war work at the earliest possible    moment and.our contracts have been largely cancelled by the    Ministry of Munitions and the Admiralty with the  rese.lt that in    a few months time we shall be altogether -without  orders.         We do not suggest,  of course,  that orders, for unnecessary    materials should be placed with us,  but it is essential that    we should know where we stand as regards the future4         If the Coventry&apos;Ordnance Works  are not required as a    nucleus armament factory in the future it  will be necessary    for us to break up the expert and highly efficient staff that    years of training has produced.   We  shall  regret  it extremely    if we are compelled to adopt this course,  since in our opinion    the Coventry Ordnance Works are eminently  suitable for the    purposes of a nucleus armament factory.   It would be possible    to combine this  work with a pease industry thus securing a    maximum of economy and efficiency.   But  it  will be obvious that    we shall be unable to retain our staff indefinitely with an    empty  order book,  and that  some  limit  must  be  put to theparalyzing
paralyzing uncertainty which surrounds the intentions of theGovernment.      Certain National factories are &quot;being retained, in being at great, cost on the off*chance that they $ay be requiredpermanently or as the result of a pclicy of drift., and if nobetter scheme oan be devised I suggest that the same prijocdpXes-should be applied in the case of private armament firms - viz,that  they should receive sufficient financial assistance toenable them to remain in being until a definite policy can be formulated and an undertaking that the cost of conversion to apeaoe footing will be borne by the State.  For it would begrossly unjust if, after having taken every advantage cf the organisation and facilities possessed by the Coventry ordnanceWorks, the Government were then to throw them on to therubbish heap like a sucked orange.      Seme consideration is due to these firms in return for what  they have done,  end in order that they may be enabled tooontribute to the future industrial prosperity of the Country.      I venture to urge that the present polioy of retainingNational factories on the off-chance that they may be requiredpermanently as armament factories is wasteful in the extreme.Some  cf the retained factories are larger than v/ill be foundnecessary under any probable&apos; conditions and will,  ho doubt,eventually be disposed of.  It is, therefore,  a great waste of public funds to delay a decision.  Surely the time has oomewhen  the Government can make up its mind on some line of polioycr at least indicate what is being done to prepare such apclicy.     The Coventry Ordnance Works is marked out by its positionand by its organization as eminently suitable for the purposesof a nucleus armament factory in combination with a substantialpeaoe industry,  A scheme for both has been worked out by us,and as far back as last July we v-rote to the Minister,of&apos;Munitions urging that some action should be taken.  But beyond formal acknowledgment our representations have received no attention,  1 trust,  however,  that we may now be given some assurance that these big reconstruction problems have advancedbeyond the long and dreary stage of formal acknowledgments. 1                I have the honour to be,  Sir,                           Your obedient Servant,                                (Sd.)  W.L. HICHENS.                                           Chairman.
