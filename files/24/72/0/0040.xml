Political  prtellicence Department,confidential.Foreign Office,december 20th,  1918)Russia /017.a.                  MEMORANDUM                         on                  THE CAU&apos;:&apos; 3 US.               (by Mr. Consul Stevens)turn.    On the occupation of the tcwn by the Russians the oversea trade of Batum grew rapidly.  At that time it was a free port.  Prac-tically all the raw produce of the Trans-Caoaasua founii its way teBatum for shipment fj foreign countries,  and all goods fromabroad intended for consumption in the Trans-Caucasus and theRussian possessions in Central-Asia were imported through thePort of Batum.   At the end of the Eighties,I believe in 1889, the&apos;RussianGovernment deprived Batum of the privileges it possessed as a free Port, and the import trade,  which up till then had been  very prosperous declined considerably owing tj its being limi-ted to the importation of feoods needed for use only in the    markets c\f Trans-Caucasus.   Thereafter the import trade of the    place remained more or leas stationary.   Eiport trade,  however,    continued to prosper.   Batum became the principal p*rt of the    Trans-Caucasus at which the raw produce of the country was shipped    and large Quantities of the various denominations of petroleum    products,  manganese ore,  liquorice root, cotton seed cake, box-    wood,  walnut logs,  wool,  raw and dried hides and a variety jf    other merchandise were shipped at the port for conveyance to    overseas countries until  the outbreak of war in 1914, when all    the shipping trade of the port ceased in consequence of theI    closing of the Dardanelles.the
   The ports of  Saturn and.  Poti,  I believe, aye  i/i  future  to be freeports.   This measure is d stmed to benefit trade and  industries and all classes  of the populations, not  only of the Trans-Caucasusbut also of the  Middle East;   Goods frvr/rnthe United Kingdom,Europe and America which have hitherto been precluded,  -  owing to                                              fromthe payment of a heavy import duty at Batumi -/finding their wayinto Trans-Caspia, Russia  Central-Asia and the northern provinces of ^ersia will reach the markets of these countries at  compare/--tively moderate  prices to the great advantage of the native c^n-(gumers who are much in need of every kind if agricultural machin-ery and implements, other modern machinery, textile, woollen andcotten gcodi? . .; all of which will penetrate into the.,  so  to speak,heart of Central Asia and mil assist in promoting all farmingindustries,  the eultivatifflnbf cotton,  development  of mineral resources and ether industrial enterprises en modern principles inthe vast territories situated Bast cf the Caspian  Sea.    Further-mere,  the revenues of the Trans-Caucasian and Trans-Caspian Rail-ways will be considerably enhanced owing to the greater volume ofgoods they will  have to transport.    For the same reasons greaterprosperity in shipping conditions on the Caspian Sea is to beforeshadowed. .  The gree transit of goods through the Trans-Caucasus willmoreover encourage industries  in the districts situatMi  seuth andsouth-west cf Batum along the  Valley of the Tcherekh in the direc-tion of Ersindjan.    The Whole of this country is said to be richin mineral  resources and the Erzindjan district, the so-called&quot;granary&quot; of Armenia possesses fertile soils which are able toproduce cereal  crops in great  abundance.,  but which owing  to thepoverty,  apathy,  laziness and  indolence of the natives and perpetualstrife in the region have not  been  cultivated to anything.like theextent to which  they can produce corn.    A railway to  follow the
 valley of  the  river  TcherecL v/oul d have  a  stimulating  effect on tho hitherto  downtrodden  and  much  persecuted  population  of  the district.   A  permanent market like Batum  at  which  the  peasants of that district  could dispose of  their  agricultural products at remunerative prices  would  encourage farmers in extending their aBsas  of cultivation, abandoning their present very primitive methods  and gradually adonting modern up-to-date machinery  and implements for working their land.    The  railway referred to could,  of course,  be built in the di- rection  of Trebizond in lieu of  Batum.  The ;  high range of mountains which ran  length-wise  through Lazistan is, however,  a formidable barrier which renders the construction of the line to Trebizond most difficult and costly, beside which Trebizond possess-    as es/:;.&apos; harbour only an open roadstead which affords no shelter for shipping.   Vessels  lying at anchor off Trebizond are ooliged to slip their cables in bad weather and to proceed for shelter under the lea  of the land at   Platana.   The winds that affect the Trebisond roadstead are from all  prints of the compass except due south.    The cultivation of tobacco in the province of Batum and in Lazistan is a very important industry and is capable of being still further,profitably developed,   During the war prices of tabaccc advanced very considerably. .   In the province of Batum three copper enterprises already exist. Many copper claims havebeen pegggd out within recent date and several allotment^plots for copper prospecting were parcelled out by the old regime  Government to would-be mine-owners who,  after the con- elusion of peace and the return of the co&apos;&apos;ntry^t$ mormal conditions  -will, in all probability,  seek to acquire in Europe the capitalneeded for  the  exploitation of their deposits.   Unexpleited deposits of coal -results of analysis made in Italy state equal to Cardiff coal - are situaWdn a few miles
 north  of Poti near Otchemchiri.     hese  deposits  could be  linked  up, without  difficulty by a  branch  railway line  to  the  oort of Poti where  the coal  could bo  shipped.0    The distance btwenn the coal mines  and Poti  is  only about -20 miles.    Coal deposits also exist in  the district of Olti,  province  of Ears.   The coal  fcund here is stated to be  of excellent  quality  and  the field covers an  expensive area.    The mines  are  owned by a itussian  Company  in v/hich  l[r, Pitojeff,  a rich Ammenian  gentleman, and Dr. Gad^making  of Tiflis are the  principal parties Interested.   The field has been explored to some extent and these gentlemen were on the  point of commencing to exploit  the mines  when war broke out.   As the  mine is  situated  al- raost on  the former ausse-Turkisb border all work had to  be  stopoed and the adjacent districts witnessed some of the bloodiest battles fought between  the i\U? sian and Turkish forces in Deoember,;  1914. Olti is not far removed from the valley of the  Tcherekh.?t A branch : line from this  latter point tc the coal field could be constructed at a small cost and subsequently with the further development of                trade industries and/     in the district, could be extended as far asKars.   The railway route  from the Black Sea at Batum tOHorth Western Persia  and Tabriz nould thus take a more direct  direction than the  line through Tiflis.   The distanoe between Batum and Tabriz would be considerably shortened and a corresponding saving in railway rates for the transport of merchandise  tc Persia Kwould thereby be effected.   In the Koteneby Scupsa lowlands of Gouria outcrops af oul are much in evidence, &apos;  Bituminous sands,  carrying a considerable quan tity of asphalt occur in the same locality.    An English company was boring for  oij in this district before the outbreak of war,  butas soon as hostilities commenced all drilling operations had to  be suspended...   An abundance of mineral oil found in this locality would soonrevolutionise the  oil industries of the world..   The impt-rtanoe  of
    prolific  oil-fields  situated so  near  the  Pert  of  Batum and.  only    seven  miles distant  from  the 3aku-Batum petroleum pipe-line with    any amount of  oil-storage accomodation  at Batum,  installations poss-    essing all necessary communications with the harbour and appliances    for pumpling the oil into ship,  is beyond description.      The cultira&amp;tion of oranges and lemons  in the province of Bajrum    in recent years has  assumed  commercial  importance.   As soon e.s    security  to life and property are ensured in the  distriot the indus-    try is likely  to extend.   Large consignments  of  oranges and lemons    grown  on  the Batum coast used to be forwarded  to &quot;the markets of    Petrograd and  Moscow and there disposed of at  very remunerative    prices.                                    inngan-   The manganese ore  territory    the  district cf Sharopan in thee.                                   ^    Government of Kutais  is reported to be the mist  extensive field in    the world.    The supply is  said to be  inexhaustible,   Seme three    hundred mineownnrs  were exploiting deposits in the dis&amp;fcict at the .    outbreak of war.    Two or three English Companies were also en-    gaged in the  industry at Tchiatcuri in the same  district and two    German properties possessing it is stated the best equipment and    installation  with every other technical detail,  barracks for single    men,   quarters for workmen&apos;s families and employees all in tip-8,    top order and state  of repair.   The Greek element is much to the    front  in the  manganese industry and trade.     The ore is shipped at    the ports ef  Bjpti and Batum.   The exports of manganese from the    two pcrts dm  1913 exceeded a million tons,  and manganese exporters,    especially the German firms, were ve/y active with their shipments    of ore during the first half of 1914.   Large stocks of ore were    stacked on the quays at Poti and Batum just befixe the Germanic-I    Turkish occupation  of the Trans-Caucasus took place,   I expect    these  stocks,  for the most  oart, have been shippediato Germany.
       Peorgia.   The aristocracy  of Georgia and  other  proprietors jf landed estates were dispossessed cf  their lands by decree  of the lepublioan Srvernment at  the beginning  of  the present year.    ?he  land-lords being ellowed tc retain only a certain limited area  for their(personal needs, but not mnre than  they  actually could deal with without the assistance of outside manual labour.   These  lands were distributed to the peasants who should,, therefore,  now rest content.   I  am afsaid though ,that Bolshevism&apos;- is working hard amOngst them, and  the more &apos; they get the more they seem to want.    Georgian labouring  classes, morelor lesft restleso since the 1906 Revolution,  have become more  trouble-isbfne in recent year3 and are a difficult element to deal with.   Work- Di4n&apos;s Committees (Soviets) headed by men who  talk much and fan  discontent[amongst the  Proletarian are ever carrying  *h  energetic agitation against employers of labour.    So soon as a point  of  dispute between  employer and employed is settled,  or a demand made by  the men acceded  to, seme fresh claim,  at time:.of a trivial nature,  is  immediately put  forward and insisted japon.    The- Committees invariably side with the men ether-wise  their members  would not long act  as a representative bedy for them.a large number of Georgians,  said to be about 250,000,  mostly desertersfrom the  Russian Army hafe gradually found their way baok to  their homes.in  the Trans-Caucasus.    They are, with a vevy few exoeptions,Bsfcshevists  and doubtless are carrying on Bolshevik oropagan$a inmost  of the  villages  in the country.    Many of them have returned withtheir rifles and a  fair stock of cartridges which renders the situationVery  difficult to deal  with.   The (Tatars nt in the Eastern Caucasusare also  mostly armed,  having either ourchased or seized the riflesthey  possess  from the  Russian soldiers when the latter were runningaway from the  Turkish  front in Asia Minor.
[          invasion by an enemy from the north or south of the Caucasus          and the likelihood of antagonism,  friction and civil war          between the three nationalities inhabiting the Trans-          Caucasus being now remote,  it is essential that the whole          population should be called upon to disarm and surrender all          rifles and ammunition in the possession of the natives, *         If the latter are alljwee to retain their arms all attempts          by the Xllies to maintain peace and-order in the country          will remain futile.   Hatred biween Armenian and Tatar dates          back mahy conturies  and can only be eradicated by the segre-          gation of the tro nationalities,  i.e.,  by removing all          Armenians from the government of Elizavetpol to the govern-          ment of ,Brivan  and  the Tatars frem Erivan to that of          Ell^avetpol.  -  I feel  convinced that this separation would          meet the  necessity of the case and I should.think would          -not,  to any great extent,  be opposed by the two nationalities.enisn        The present boundary between Armenia and the Republic ofadary.          Azerbaijan cruld thus  be retained  without hazarding the          interests of either  netionalities,ttkhoum.       Soukhoum has always been a separate, circuit.    At one         &apos; time there was much  talk of embodying the district and          Black Sea littoral situated between that pert and Kobuleti          in the province.of Batum,    Bad the Imperial Government          continued to remain  in power it is.probable that the          fusion of the two districts w*uld  have  taken place on the         vclose of the :war.  Soukhoum is populated principally by          natives of Abhasian  origin  who are Moslems and who,  I          believe,  would favour  being included in ths&quot; country ad-          jacent to their own  kith and kin like Georgia&apos;in prefer-          ence to being absorbed in: the-Government of Tchernomoria.m                                                    absence ofisarming     in view of what I have  said above,  the/danger  as regardsfrpulation.
A number of Esthonian colonists took up their abode in the dis-trict of Soukhoun some fifty years or sd ago.  T h?ir villages areftr the most part situated along the valley of the river Koder..A large number *f Greek tobacco planters from localities on theAiatolian coast visit the district of .*oukhoum anually and obtainremunerative work *n the tobacco plantations which are numerous.Railway construction, with a view to linking up the Government ofTchernomoria with the Trans-Caucasian railway system at Uovc-senakiwas undertaken a year or so before the outbreak of war, but had tobe abandoned for want of funds, the Russian Government having wit In-drawn all assignments for the purpese.    At some points of the roadembankments, masonry and earthworks are well advanced.  A gooddeal of land and house property at Soukhoum was purchased by Russianfamilies from Petrograd and llosoow who were in the habit of spendingtheir winters in the milder climate of the place.   I expect allreal property in the dit  district of Soukhoum has been dealt with ina similar manner to that of ether parts of the Trans-Caucasus andall lands have probably gone over to the peasantry.al.     Sakatal is another separate circuit of the Tsans-Caucasus.The  native population here is Georgian,  Armenian and Tatar; theletter element,  I believe,  predominate.    The district is separated from the Government of Elisavetpol by portions of the Governmentof Tiflis and *n this gsraund should be  included in Getrgia.   Thedistrict is  conterminous  with ICahetia which is purely Georgian.Some years ago Georgian enterprise built a railway into Kahetiaout of funds provided by the Georgian people.
lem         I consider the Moslem populations  of  Georgia  should  heonomy.      --granted -complete-outonomy in their  home affairs.    I  think       this  would meet with the  views  and  wishes  of the majority       of Moslems in the  country.            Both in Georgia and  in the  Tatar  districts of the       Trans-Caucasus Moslems  as a rule are  completely domineered       hy their Begs.  . The overhearing attitude  adopted  hy  the       latter towards the uneducated classes is much resented and       the Moslem proletariat  would he glad to shaice off  their       yoke.    The feeling against the Begs, in some localities  of       Tatar country,  is  so strong that in the early part  of the       present year,  a whole family belonging  to  the so-called       Mussulman aristocracy of  the Government of Elizavetpol was       assassinated hy the peasantry.            Railway.    The Condition of most of the rolling stook       on the Trans-daucasian  railway is anything but satisfactory.       A  great number  of  locomotives, passenger cars and goods       trucks are  unserviceable  and need thorough overhauling and       repair..   In this  connection I should think: it would be as       well  if a  railway battalion accompanied the force  vtiich it is       intended should occupy  and maintain order  along the line       between&apos;Batum and Baku,   Subject to modification by the       Military authorities, I think that  an approximate force of       20,000 would  be  sufficient to guard the railway and that       portion of  the Trans-Caucasus whioh it  is proposed the       British should police.   This estimate  is based on the       following distribution  of the force:           2,000 men at Batum.           1,000   &quot;   &quot;  Kutais.           5,000   &quot;   &quot;  Tiflis.           1,000   &quot;  &quot;  Elizavetpoi,
3,000 men at Baku.1,500I!along the line between Batum and Tiflis,  500of whom should be stationed at Mihailovo andanother 500t Santredi.250at Poti and1,000along the line between Tiflis and Baku,        A  further  force, the numerical  strength of which I am not        competent  to define, will be required to guard  the Daghestan        boundary.   The  country here is very hilly and  difficult and        I  am  afraid a  force of some strength will be needed.   Any        balance  of troops I should think could be advantageously em-        ployed in  the  country south of the railway, as  for instance,        the Berjon, Abastuman, Akhalkalaki and Akhaltsikh districts.        A  few men  would also have to be distributed in the province        of Batum,  i.e., in Adjaria and in Lazistan which is to be        incorporated in Georgia.   In order to efficiently police the        country  my idea is that a mixed force of local natives under        the control of British officers should be formed and employed        in their respective rural districts.   It is useless importing        men from outside districts to perform these services.   The        Christian  population would strongly resent being policed by        Moslems; in the same manner the latter would object to order        being preserved In their districts by Christians.freoks *       A great number of Greeks reside alon^ the Black Sea        coast, most of the towns situated between Kovorossisk and        Trebizond  have large Greek communities.    As a rule they have        their own  clergy and schools and churches and do not inter-        mingle to  any great extent with the natives or inhabitants        of other than their own nationality.            Cotton.    Cotton is extensively grown in the  Mougan and        Miel steppes of the Government of Elisavetpol,    In order to        render land in the two districts more productive and to
       foster  tlie  cultivation of  cotton,  the Russian Government,  at       a very  considerable  expend!4;.ure  spread  over  a number of years,       carried out irrigation works  in  the two districts which now       possess (unless  destroyed  during the civil war  which was waged       in March last) a magnificent  system of  irrigation canals with       the necessary plant  for pumping  water and the whole of these       extensive areas  of practically arid barren lands have been       converted into fertile soil of high productive power.   The       cotton  growers in the  two  districts were mostly Russian       peasants to whom grants of land  were gratuitously made and       cotton-growing before  the  war was  in every way encouraged.       During  the  troubles  in the early part of the year these settlers       abandoned their  lands  after  several of  tneir villages had  been       wiped out and all their belongings looted by Tatar bands,           A  large number, in fact probably all, the Duhobor, Molokan       and Baptist Sectarians  who had been banished by the Russian       Government  to the Trans-Caucasus for their separation from       the  Orthodox Church  and their exclusive religious views and       convictions have, I-  expect., now  left the Caucasus.    In May       last, when  I was travelling from Tiflis to Vladikavkaz, the       Georgian military road  was simply packed with refugees       belonging to the above  sects, to Turkish and Russian       Armenians and to dismissed Russian-military officers.    A       rough estimate would set the number of refugees on the road,       during the  four days I  was travelling along it;  at  least at       50,000 souls. tude      From conversations  I have had with members  of  theRussian nians.   Armenian community  of Tiflis many Russian Armenians       favour federation with Russia, although  the great bulk of      the Armenians of the Trans-Caucasus would  favourably      countenance  close union with the Turkish Armenians  and  the      formation of a separate Armenian Kingdom or state under the
       guarantee and protection oi&quot; western European Powers and/or      the United States of America.           Baku.  It appears almost a crime to allow an important      industrial and commercial centre like the town of Ba^i to      fall into the hands of - the Republic of Azerbaidjan although,      of course, a very large proportion of the oil industry is in      the hands of Tatar magnates who possess very considerable      wealth and have great influence over the Moslem inhabitants      of the town and alee the working; classes, a full I if ty per      oent of the latter, in the district oi Baku, are of Tatar      origin.   Pew, if any, purely Russian firms are en?;ae;ed in      the Baku oil industry.   The principal producers of petroleum      are, as I have just said, Tatars,  also Armenians whose      interests in the oil fields are about equally divided? next      in turn come the British Companies and subsequently French,      German and Belgian Interests are represented in the order in      which they are ;.;iven.   Should Baku become the capital of      the Azerbaidjan Republic it will be necessary, as a set-off      against the exclusion of the town from the Russian dominions.,      to guarantee a permanent supply of crude and illuminating oils      for consumption in Russia.   At least 60 to 65 per cent of the      output of oil in normal times was shipped at Baru and con-      veyed to the river Volga for distribution to the various     , industrial establishments situated along; both banks of that      river, for use in the Moscow and Petrocrad distriots and      other Governments of Northern Russia.   The other 35 per      cent of petroleum products were conveyed by rail and pipe      line to Batum for export to foreign countries and for ship-      ment to Russian Black Sea ports. Hn-      The boundary between Georgia and Armenia is more  or less-niandarj. defined by the existing southern borders,of the Governments      of Tiflis and Kutais and of the province of Batum.   Accord-                           i                1      ing to these delimitations the whole of the Government of.

The Government of Tchernomoria  comprises the territoryIftstretching along the Black Sea coast from north-west to south-east as far as the confines of the district ofSoukhoum being separate.:&apos;, from Circassia by the main CaucasianChain,   The seat of Government of the province is Novorossisk,a thinly populated town but well equipped port for the exportof the abundant corn crops raised in the black-soil regions ofthe province of Kuban, the Government of Stavropol andportions of the province of Terek.   The populations of thenorthern localities of the Government of Tchernomoria aresettlers of Little Russian origin principally engaged in agricultural pursuits,   The southern end of the Governmentis inhabited by Russians and  Moslems, agriculturists and persons engaged in the culture of tobacco, climatic con-ditions in the district and the nature of the soil beingespecially favourable for this particular kind of industry.Several vast virgin timber forests exist in the Government;The magnificent harbour oi Gelendjik, a naturally closed-inspace of deep water free from the Bora winds which are soprevalent and dangerous for shipping, at Novorossisk, is situated a short distance south of the latter mentioned part.Gagri and Sochi are two points of some importance on thecoast of Tchernomoria.   Many Russians from Petrograd and moscow have acquired lands at these two places and severalmillion roubles were expended by Prince Eugene of Oldenburga few years ago in erecting a large hotel at Gagri and con-converting the town into a winter resort of the most modern type.A good metalled road runs lengthwise through the provinceas far as Soukhoum and Tuapse,a port of the future, isconnected by rail, through Maikop, with the railway station
        of Armavir on the Vladikavkaz Trunk Railway,Ikop,        In the Maikop district,  province of  Kuban,  British        capitalists are interested in oil territories  to  the  extent        of fourteen million sterling,    Extensive  boring  operations        were in progress in the district on the  outbreak  01 war,  but        in view of the unsettled conditions obtaining  in  the        locality and trouble with the Cossack population,  I am        afraid all work in connection with the oil fields  has been        suspended for some considerable time.    A  petroleum pipe        line from Maikop to the station of enemy  on the Ekaterinodar        branch line carries the output of these  wells  to  the  markets        of the northern Caucasus.    The production of  oil  here        averages about 2,500 to 3,000 tons per month.roani,        British petroleum Interests are also  well represented        at Grozni in the Terek district.   The oil fields  here are        very extensive,   In course  of time,, with  further develop-   *     ment,. these fields are likely to be as important  as the        Baloi oil territory.   Fresh petroleum areas were  being        steadily explored and included in the oil-bearing zone        on the outbreak of war.   Unfortunately, since the advent        of the revolution serious troubles 32V*G taksn. place  at  Grozni        and a state of civil war and complete anarchy  has  prevailed        in the district for over a year.  &apos;It is reported the .
