The opinion of the Labour press on Military Affairs,with special reference to the Leagueof Nations,  the Army  of Occupation,  and Conscription, and on Home Affairs, withspecial reference to the General Election, is described.          (2) THE DAILY  PRESS ON DEMOBILISATION AND RESETTLEMENT.    The views of  the daily press on the Discharge of  Munition Workers, with special reference to Women, to the Future of Government establishments, and to the Unemploy-ment Donation, and on Demobilisation of the Army, with special reference to Delay andto Disabled Men, is described.Part III : District Heyorts.    The country generally is tranquil, the  strike of the cotton textile workers havingbeen settled.Part IV :  Disputes.                         (a)  Involving a Stoppage of Work.    The strikes in  the Lancashire Cotton industry, in  the Bedwas Colliery and amongthe Dock labourers on the  Clyde,  have been settled and no other serious stoppage is inprogress.                       (b) Not Involving a Stoppage of Work.    There are disputes at  several large  collieries on Wages  questions; other  disputesare unimportant.                              L-GENERAL REMARKS.The Labour Situation.    The terms of settlement of the dispute which led to a strike in the Cotton  textile industry have been, accepted on both, sides.  They were detailed in this report for  lastweek.  Work was resumed to-day  (19th December).    The strike at the Glasgow docks which had led to complete paralysis of the Port hasalso been settledon terms which amount to acceptance of the demands  made by themen.  Finally, the strike at the Bedwas Colliery, which has been in progress for some time,has now been settled, the cause of the dispute being remitted for public enquiry.    With these settlements the industrial position is for  the moment tranquil.   Thereare, however, certain questions at  present being  agitated  which promise to give rise todifficulty in the near future.  Of these perhaps the most important is the demand which.is now being very generally made for a considerable reduction in  the  number of hoursof the working week,  Beginning with the men employed on the North-East Coast, who made a claim for a 44-hour week, to which the employers replied with an offer of  47, thequestion has been raised in many quarters.  The transport workers, for  instance, are    (C 1588) ,
 asking for a general advance of 10s. a week, combined with a reduction of hours to an eight-hour day for five days and a half per week.  The shop stewards have taken up the case nationally and are calling a  meeting of representatives of shop stewards from all centres to decide whether a general demand for a reduction shall be made, if so, at what number of hours the working week should be fHed and what action should be taken if the demand is refused.     The arguments in support  of the claim are manifold.  There is  a natural desire on the part of the men that the working week should be as short as possible in order to allow a certain minimum of leisure.  Generally, however, an additional argument is used, to the effect that a reduction of hours  will lead to the  employment of additional men, and will create vacancies lor those who  come back from the front on demobilisation.  It seems probable, however, that the demand is in essence a claim for higher wages put  in a different way.  In every case the claim for a  reduction in the working hours of  the week is accom- panied by a condition  that this reduction should not affect the weekly  wages.   Special rates are demanded for overtime arid Sunday work, and it appears probable that, should the demand be accepted, the actual number of hours worked might in  fact show  little trace of reduction.     Though 44 is usually the number of hours  mentioned  by applicants, extreme cases have been instanced in which 36  hours, and even in one case 35 hours, have been claimed as  a working week.  It is true that in certain industries experience has shown that a reduction  of hours has coincided with maintenance of production or even with  increased production.   It is clear, however, that these results will not be  by any means universal, and that the reduction of hours  has very definite limitations in  relation to the  economic position of each industry.  It is  a question which can only be dealt with by the industries themselves, and the transition from the artificial conditions created by the war is almost certain to be marked by severe struggles, in which the workers put forward claims which the employers feel are  impossible to meet if their business is to continue.  The State will be unable to intervene as it  did in the munitions trades during the war by allowing the employers to charge higher prices to meet the labour costs,  as the State is no longer the employer. Oases will therefore probably arise in the near future in which conciliation will be practically powerless and a strike the only solution.  This is a position which will have to be faced, and it may arise in connection with the Transport Workers&apos; claims, unless they are modified.  The A.S.E.  ballot  on the employers&apos; proposal of  a 47-hour week isalso said to show a strong demand  for a 44-hour week which may lead to trouble.                                II. PRESS COMMENTS.                       (1) THE LABOUR AND SOCIALIST PRESS.                                   (A) Military.League of Nations.    Dealing with this subject &quot;Justice&quot; points out that it is impossible  to constructsuch  a League at the Peace Conference while  Russia, Turkey, Austria Hungary  andGermany are in a state of chaos.  A beginning should be made by combining the AlliedPowers in a League to enforce peace.   The paper criticises  common talk of a &quot; Leagueof the Peoples,&quot;  pointing out that directly Central Government  is dissolved,  no such.thing as  the people exists, but only a collection of  parties, factions and individuals ineach country.                                                                      *Armistice Terms.    The  &quot; Labour Leader &quot; returns to the subject of the hunger war on Germany in anarticle by &quot; an Englishman.&quot;  Extracts from German newspapers are quoted to prove that women and children are being slowly starved to death.   The German claim is one onHumanity, pure and simple.  The article demands the revision of the terms, and thinks that British Labour will surely, support this demand.  The &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot;notes that no single labour leader has raised an emphatic protest against the harsh punish-ment  which was intended for a capitalist Kaiser being imposed on the German peopleby a combination  of capitalist states.The Kaiser.    &quot;Justice &quot; has an article by  Robert Arch anticipating  that the Kaiser will not be executed, because the case will be decided by statesmen.  The writer thinks that humanquality is at stake, and that the Kaiser should not escape because he is a King.
  The Army of Occupation.      The &quot; Herald &quot; considers that the demand for salutation of Allied Officers, and the  knocking off  of hats from civilians  who fail to salute, are  destroying every chance of  friendship, and thus preparing for future wars.  The &quot; Call &quot; reports that heavy contri-  butions are being laid on occupied towns by the Allies, just  as Germany did in Belgium  and France.  The paper also resents the refusal to treat with  the Soviets, and both the  &quot; Call &quot; and the  &quot; Herald &quot; report an ultimatum to Germany  that it must dissolve the  Soviets if it wants food.  The &quot; Herald &quot; concludes that the  whole power of the Alliance  will be used to compel the revolution to take the form desired by Whitehall.  British Prisoners in Germany.      The &quot; Herald &quot;  prints  an article describing the experiences of Captain Lewis, R.N.,  in which it  describes the perfect consideration and courtesy with which he was treated  throughout the period of his detention.  Conscription.      All the papers combine to  agitate against the continuance of conscription.   The  &quot;  Herald &quot; points out that  Mr. Lloyd George has made its abolition dependent on the  action of other nations.   Other nations will clearly,  not disarm while we retain our Navy.  It seems  certain, therefore, that conscription will  remain.   The constitution of  Army  Reserve Z conies in for scathing criticism both in the  &quot; Herald &quot; and in the &quot; Call.&quot;  Major  Gillespie, D.S.O.,  in the former paper, suggests that this forms a new contract of liability  to recall in case of emergency and &quot;in consideration of early release from military duties.&quot;  The &quot; Call &quot; thinks it is the result of capitalist clamour for  consciption, because of the  increased power which this  gives  to them, and suggests that conscripted men will be used  to starve  the  worker into submission by the employment of the armed section of the  working class against the unarmed.     On this  subjectie Justice &quot; agrees in the advisability of the  abolition of conscription,  but thinks that it is essential that armed force of some kind must be maintained pending  universal disarmament.  The  paper  suggests abolition  of the  standing army, and the  substitution of universal military training, free from military law in time of peace.                                 (B) foreign Affairs. Russia.     The campaign against intervention  is continued with vigour.  The &quot; Herald &quot; refers to  the  Governments obstinate silence on the subject, pointing out that there is no news from Odessa, except the fact that  the  Imperial Flag  is flying on  the Russian Fleet.   The paper concludes from the fact that the delegates for the Peace Conference are to be Prince Lvoff and M.  Isvolsky, that Allied Intervention practically means war on the whole revolution. It is suggested that negotiations through M. Litvinoff are possible and should be  initiated.   The &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought &quot; reprints from the &quot; Liberator &quot; an article. by Mr. John Reed, Bolshevik Ambassador in New  York, condemning intervention and justifying the Bolshevik Government.   The &quot; Herald &quot; also prints, an article on Britain and Russia by Mr. Douglas  Young, who was British Consul at Archangel up to the time that the Expeditionary Force landed there.   This gentleman makes a bitter attack on the Foreign Office.  He alleges  that problems of the first moment are  being dealt with by ignorant officials of minor rank.  He accuses the British Government of having played a dirty double  game in which it stabbed the Soviet Government in the back.  He denies the charge of violation of the British Embassy, on the ground that it no longer existed, and explains  the action of the Soviet  Government as due to organisation on the part of the representatives of the War Office and the Admiralty to overthrow the Russian Govern- ment.   He admits that Bolshevism is  bad.   He alleges that it has been strengthened by the British Expedition, which compelled the Soviet Government  to adopt cruel and inexperienced- cusable methods for its own preservation.  He thinks that war  can be avoided, and an understanding acceptable both to extreme socialists and to capitalists be arranged, if a Soviet Delegation were to meet members of all political parties.  To this end M. LvinofT is in Stockholm ready to negotiate.  Mr. Brailsford has an article in the same paper con- demning the expedition.  The &quot; Labour Leader&quot;  describes  the expedition as a war against working people rrdio  want to mind their own business.  It means that the boys will not come back for many a month, and that thousands will never come back again,and it concludes: &quot;Vote for Labour and stop the war with Russia.&quot;  The &quot; Workers&apos;Dreadnought &quot;  as usual prints a laudatory article on the Soviet  Government.  It printsthe text of a law to introduce an eight-hour day, and to prevent employment to any young    (0 1588)                                                                 A 2
 people under 20 years of age from 1st January, 1920, or under 15 from 1st January, 1919. It also reports that the  Bolsheviks are providing free medicine,  schools in very large numbers, and universities, and are also running a Literature Train.   The &quot;Call&quot; reviews with approval a book entitled &quot; Unchained Russia,&quot; by Mr. C. E. Russell, an American, who describes the Bolshevik Leaders as cultivated, pleasant and interesting men, and the Bolsheviks generally as being in no  way  sansculotte.   He says that nothing is further from their cherished aim  than a red terror.                                (C). Home  Affairs. General Election.     As was to  be expected, the papers  are almost entirely occupied with propaganda in connection with the Election.  In the&quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought &quot; there is a somewhat remarkable article by W. F. Watson in which he suggests that the Election was simply fixed at this time in order to maintain among the working classes the disunity originally caused by the war.  He says that Parliament is discredited after four years during  which time reference to it  has been in abeyance.  The workers have had  to rely on  their own industrial organisation, and the abject failure of their constitutional officialism forces the rank and file to rely upon itself.  One fact of the General Election has been to induce Trade Union Officials and in certain cases Shop Stewards to stand for  Parliament&quot; wasting valuable  time messing around  with  the  abominable Parliamentary  machine.&quot;   The writer is convinced  that  revolutionary industrialists will have to repudiate it, and  to build up a National Administrative Council outside the capitalists&apos; structure, in  order to supersede it.     It seems clear from the tone of the papers that  the Labour Party is anxious as to the opinions of  the soldiers.   Urgent appeals are made  to them to support the Labour Party, and attempts to divide the soldier from the civilian are deprecated.   The &quot; Herald,&quot; for instance, in  appealing to workers and soldiers  to join hands, quotes the instance  of an officer at the front, who addressed his men returning to England, advising them  to retaliate on those who had struck while they were  at the front.   The same paper  prints a special address for soldiers in connectionWith the Election.  The Labour  Party does not escape criticism.   The &quot; Clarion,&quot;  which occupies rather a detached position, quotes with approval the saying of a woman  voter &quot; all three parties promise the same things and we don&apos;t believe&apos;any of thern.&quot;   &quot; Justice &quot; remarks on the unaccountable absence of the Pacifists  from electioneering platforms.  The &quot; Clarion &quot; thinks that Labour will find it difficult to excuse to soldiers and sailors the strikes that occurred during the war. &quot; Justice &quot; has a critical article on the action of the Labour Party.   It thinks there is no real solidarity in  the party nor any combined enthusiasm.  Self-seeking middle-class politicians have been  accepted as Labour Candidates, while intrigue has been evident against some of the  ablest and most devoted trade unionists.  There has been a lack of real socialist statesmanship in the party, and the idea of progress held by the Executive amounts to  commonplace compromise.  At another place the same paper  anticipates that perhaps 70 Labour candidates will be elected,  and thinks that  number will be quite sufficient. The more numerous the Labour members the weaker the party will be, because of the  divergency of  views which are prevalent among Labour candidates  on almost  every question.   The &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot; describes the Labour party as a medley of ex- Liberals, ex-Tories, Jingo  Trade Unionists  of  narrow outlook, middle-class Pacifists and a  small sprinkling of Socialists.  The  Labour Programme is the product of Mr. Sydney Webb, and the ideas he expresses have long been discarded by the  rank and file.   Even should the Labour Party obtain a majority it could only form a wishy-waslry Reformist Government.  In. any  case there is nothing to be hoped from any  Parliament, and the sooner Britain gets its Soviets  the better.     The &quot; Call &quot; has an attack on Mr. Lloyd George under the caption, Our &quot;promising &quot; Premier. President Wilson&apos;&apos;s Visit.    The &quot; Herald &quot;  calls upon organised  Labour and upon women to assemble in force to welcome President Wilson on the grounds that, though they may differ from him largely on other questions, they are with  him on the issues of war, and, like him, want a  clean peace.                                                          ^Release of John Maclean.    The &quot; Call &quot; prints a special message from John Maclean of the normal red flag  type, suggesting that if he  is returned to Parliament the days of an unjust capitalism are  done. It also prints an article by Mrs. Dora Montefiore on impressions of Maclean&apos;s reception in glasgow.  The manifesto and the  impressions extend to a whole page of the paper.
           (2) THE DAILY PRESS ON DEMOBILISATION AND RESETTLEMENT.                        (A). Discharges of Munition Workers.     There appear to be considerably fewer references to the subject of discharged muni- tion workers this week. Women.     With regard to  the women, though their discharges  continue, prospects for their re-employment  in peace-time industry seem to be  improving.   The  &quot;Daily  Mail&quot; (December .16th) states that the largest number yet registered signed on for unemployment donation during the week-end.  Conflicting opinions as to  the condition of  unemployed women at Birmingham are expressed.  The &quot;Daily  Telegraph&quot; (December .1.1th) for example, states that  crowds of women munition workers visited the Brimingham Em- ployment Exchange on  December 10th, the number of unemployed women in that city being ten times greater than  the number of men.  The majority refuse to  return to domestive service.  The &quot; Birmingham Post&quot;  (December 13th), on the  other hand, announces that  &quot; applicants for women&apos;s unemployment donation this week  numbered only a few hundreds.&quot;  it also states that although the majority, who were previously employed in factories, will return to their old work as soon as possible, a large number are tired  of factory life and are returning to domestic; service.     Referring to the prospects of  women&apos;s  employment,  demands for  1,000  dress- makers and  also for  waitresses in London are mentioned by the &quot;Daily  Telegraph&quot; (December 14th), while  the &quot; Daily Mail &quot; states that the post office has asked for 7,600 women ; but has failed to get them.   It is said that munition workers will not accept the rates of 37s. Qd.  and 38s. Qd. per week which are offered.     The &quot; Liverpool Post &quot; (December 9th) mentions the long queues of women standing outside the employment exchanges waiting to register, and the suggestion is made that they should, be able &quot; to fill up the forms for the Labour Bureaux at their leisure,&quot; pre- sumably at home, instead of having  to wait for hours in a queue.     The &quot; Daily Express &quot; (December 12th) published a letter from Viscountess Rhondda giving Lloyd George&apos;s answer to the memorial presented  by the Women&apos;s Industrial League, in which he promises, among other things, that new industries shall be opened to women, that they shall receive  equal pay for equal output, and that they shall have more effective representation on Government Committees.  According to the &quot; Morning Post &quot; (December 13th), a committee of women has been set up &quot; acting in an advisory capacity to Dr. Addison,  Minister of Reconstruction,&quot; for the purpose of protecting the interests of women during reconstruction. Future of Government Establishments.     Some anxiety is expressed concerning the future of National Factories.  The &quot; Glasgow Herald &quot; (December 9th) quotes the resolution of the  Parliamentary Committee  of the Scottish Trades  Union Congress, demanding  that the Government should make an im- mediate statement of  their proposals in regard to the future use of the Georgetown and other factories.  Mr. Hodge, speaking at Manchester (&quot; Manchester Guardian,&quot; Decem- ber 13th), proposed that peace-time commodities should be produced in National Factories.     According to the  &quot; Daily Telegraph &quot; (December 14th) &quot; considerable  anxiety  has been evinced as to future employment in the Royal Dockyards.  The Admiralty, however, repudiates the rumour that a large number of discharges are to take place immediately in these yards.&quot; Unemployment Donations.     Two special objections to the  increase  of  this  donation  are  emphasised.  The &quot;Westminster Gazette&quot; (December 11th) expects  that it will raise the whole level of wages over the country :  &quot; the greater the unemployment benefits the worker  can obtain, the higher will have to be the wage that will tempt him to resume his tools.   The process of getting workers back to  civilian industry will be hindered, the more profitable it is made to be out of work.&quot;     &quot;Truth.&quot; (December  11th) describes the increase in the donation as  &quot;collective bribery  &quot; ; &quot;  while the fact that the cost of it is being  added to the burden  of war debt seems to pass unheeded.&quot;                          (B). Demobilisation of the Army. Delay.     Complaints of delay in carrying out the scheme continue to appear in some of  the papers : but reasons for this delay are also mentioned.
     The &quot; Daily Mail &quot; (December lltli) demands a dictator to speed up &quot; the machine,&quot;&quot; and according to the &quot; Daily News &quot; (December 11th)  &quot;the lack of forethought and pre- paration in the restoration of industry to peace conditions becomes more manifest every day.&quot;   There then follows  a. long hostile review of the Government plans.  A  eorres- correspondent in the &quot; Globe&quot; (December lltli) asks &quot; Is Germany preparing to resist  the Allies&apos; demands ?  If  she is not, then why not demobilise promptly  as the Americans are doing ? &quot;     Both the &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot; (December 11th) and the &quot;Daily Chronicle&quot; (December 13th)  put  down the delay  in demobilising, to the transport difficulties in France, especially as the Germans have mined tire railways in the evacuated areas.     (Several papers give figures of the number of men already demobilised, the &quot; Daily Mail &quot; (December16th) reports that the first detachment of pivotal men 40 officers and 2,042  men were to arrive at Southampton on December 16th ; the &quot; Times &quot; announces that 25,000 miners, 1,000 shipbuilders, 11,000 miscellaneous  men have  already been demobilised. Priority Claims.     Several papers announce that priority claims have  been  granted  to certain classes of  workers, for example, policemen, men with jobs  waiting for them, and in some units, men over 41 years.  Nevertheless, demands are made for the speedy release of other classes of  labour.  The &quot; Glasgow  Herald &quot; (December 12th) calls for the quicker release  of skilled shipbuilders,  the  &quot; Manchester  Guardian &quot;  (December 12th) suggests that boys between the ages of 17^ and 18^ should be demobilised &quot; at once and without red  tape,&quot;     The &quot; Railway Review,&quot; as may be expected, demands the early release of all rail- waymen.  It is  stated in  the &quot; Birmingham Post&quot;  (December 13th) that many officers are retaining  the best  of  their N.C.Os., even  though  these gave up good positions  to volunteer at the beginning of the war ; &quot; and it is feared that they may lose their chance of rejoining these positions, while the comparative &apos; waster&apos; will be free to come  home and fill them.&quot; Disabled Men.     Some anxiety is felt regarding the future prospects  of these men in industry.  Lieut- Col. Sir John Norton Griffiths writes to the &quot; Times &quot;  (December 11th) advocating that &quot; the Government compel every employer to engage at least 5 or 10 per cent, of wounded men&quot;  ; and Mr. Hodge,  speaking  at Manchester (&quot;Manchester Guardian,&quot;  December 13th) voices the same  demand.  The &quot;South Wales  News&quot; (December  10th) reports that the  Iron and, Steel Trades Association has decided to establish a  War Disablement Fund to  pay special accident grants to members permanently&apos; disabled  through the war.. A monthly levy is to be raised, for the purpose. Conscription.    The  &quot; Daily News  &quot; (December 12th.)  reports that the Labour Party lias issued a manifesto demanding the immediate abolition of all compulsory military service.Demobilisation a  Military Question.    The  &quot;Morning Post,&quot; both on December  12th  and  13th,  strongly emphasises thepoint of view that demobilisation is a military matter, and that in the words of Lieut-Col. Repington &quot; to talk of general demobilisation, and still more to carry it out, beforepeace is signed, would be an act of lunacy.&quot;                            III. DISTRICT REPOETS.London and. South Eastern.    The situation generally continues to be tranquil.  At Cubitts some trouble has arisenbecause a girl received a week&apos;s notice on disciplinary grounds.  It is believed that this method is to be employed merely as an excuse to get rid of girls, and will be used in many other cases.   The matter is being placed before the Management.West Midlands.    In this district also, conditions are generally satisfactory.  At Coventry it is reportedthat work is proceeding very smoothly at the moment and not much unemployment isanticipated.  The raising of the unemployment benefits is said to have had a conciliatoryeffect.
 Yorkshire and East Midlands.     The trouble in the Nottingham Lace Trade lias become so serious that a strike in the plain  net section is regarded as certain.     There is also some unrest among the miners at several collieries in this area.                                    i North  Western.     A considerable  amount of unrest is reported  from Manchester, this is principally due to the hostile attitude shown by the engineering employers towards the shop stewards, who are&apos; being discharged wherever possible.  The feeling aroused among the workers is so strong that a strike has broken out at A.  \.  Roe&apos;s, and a second is threatened at another firm.     At Barrow,  a mass meeting held on December 9th, under the auspices of the Iron and Shipbuilding federation, passed a resolution in favour of a 35-hour week.   It was also decided to hold a National Conference of shop stewards to discuss the question of hours  and to adopt a common policy for enforcing any decision which they may arrive at. Northern.     Two meetings have been held at Newcastle  (one on December 7th and  one on the 12th)  to protest  against the G-overnmenfs policy with regard to the demobilisation of war workers.  The speakers predicted a, considerable  amount of unemployment during the period of reconstruction  and resolutions were passed protesting against the inadequate out of  work donations.     It is reported that the  opposition to the employers&apos; offer of a 47-hour week in the engineering and allied trades, is growing stronger.   The majority of the workers are in favour of a 44-hoiir  week, while extremists are advocating a week of only 36 hours. Wales.     Several strikes are reported to be in progress at various collieries.   No unrest, however, appears to exist  among other classes of workers.     With regard to the strike at the Bedwas Colliery, it is stated that the matter in dispute is being pressed from an ulterior motive, namely, to destroy the colliery examiners&apos; union  and compel its members to join the Miners&apos; Federation, and thereby to strengthen the miners&apos; position against the coal owners. Scotland.     With the  exception of  a  strike among  the workers employed by the Clyde Trust,the district continues to be quiet.                                  &apos; IV. DISPUTES.     Conditions  appear to  be tranquil in most spheres of industry,  except  among thecoal miners in several districts and the lace makers in Nottingham.           In South Wales,  three strikes have been in progress lately which all seem to be directed        against the firemen.  It seems undoubtedly true that these are part of a concerted plan to        destroy the Colliery Examiners&apos; Union to which the firemen belong in -order to compel them        to join the Miners&apos; Federation.(a) Involving a Stoppage of Work.     The Admiralty Labour Department reports four minor  strikes for the week endingDecember 14th.  Two were demarcation disputes which lasted not more than two days.           On December 9th, 15  cablesmiths and strikers ceased work at Lloyd&apos;s Proving House,        Cradley Heath, owing to the refusal of the firm to concede the men&apos;s claim for 25 per cent        advance in wages.     The Coal Controller reports 13  fresh stoppages for the week ending December 17th,in 10 cases work has already been resumed.   None are of  very serious importance.-     The War Office Contracts Department has nothing to report.
