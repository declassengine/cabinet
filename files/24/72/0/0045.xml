Lewis,  Bt.           j                   Sir Kenneth  Anderson,  K.C.I.G.J  Ministry of                  Mr.  Graeme Thomson, C.B.      j  Shipping,                  Mr.  John  Anderson, C.B,       j                  Mr.  Salter,  C.B.   and        j                  Mr.  p.p.  Robinson.            J     SIR JOSEPH MACLAY briefly explained the considerations whichhad led the Ministry cf Shipping to submit the two memoranda tothe War Cabinet.  Immediately the Armistice took place a large amount of tonnage which had been ear-marked for the carriage of  *troops and war material was suddenly released; no less than 146ships engaged on military service,  principally large vessels.,became  available; the import of munitions stopped; the stoppageon the cross-Channel service to prance amounted to 66,000 tonsweekly; the discontinuance of convoys increased the carryingpower of ships; the space, set aside for the carriage of horsesin 77 vessels was set free; the import of troops from Americaand Australasia ceased; the amount  of tonnage under repair gradu-ally fell.  The position to-day is  that the various Committeesdealing with imports have made up returns shewing that  theestimated requirements of the United Kingdom in the next sixmonths will be 18,000,000 tons,  or  at the rate of 36,000,000 ayear.  Practically every port in the United Kingdom is blockedwith commodities.  Sir John Beale had told him that there was sufficient wheat in the country to  carry us over until the nextharvest.  The stock of nitrate is very high.   As against this theamount of tonnage available on a conservative estimate represents an import of 42,000,000 tons,  even  allowing for maintaining thetonnage available for imports into  France and Italy at the pre-armistice level.  The world&apos;s tonnage is but  little short of the
 pre-.war figure whereas the volume of world trade is not likely to&apos; approach the pre-war fi -ure for some tine.  Ships are being sent to Australia to fetch cereals and it is anticipated that hy next harvest it will be possible to bring to Europe,  princi- pally to the United Kingdom,  about 2.OOO,000 tons.      The shipping Controller referred to the present hi/an freights on commercial cargo from Canada to the United States of America and explained that the present system was to allow the  Lines  to offer 10% of their cargo space in the open market.   For this  10% there was naturally very great competition and hence, high freights.  The Ministry of shipping look for relief froa the anomalous position by gradually extending the percentage offered on the open market,  and are satisfied that the policy of gradually increasing this percentage will result in reduced freights all round,      There is the further point that the cost of running ships at the present time is about  three times the pre-war cost and the Ministry of Shipping do not believe that this cost  will be reduced until the ships are returned to the owners,      Yuliat the Ministry of Shipping propose is to give up the system of requisition and in  its stead to exercise  control by requiring every ship to obtain a license for the employment on which, it is to be engaged  - a system which would enable both rates and cargoes to be controlled as necessary. Further,  the Ministry of Shipping retains  the power to revert to requisition should it prove desirable in  individual cases or generally.      As regards the enemy tonnage,  it is estimated  that this will he sufficient not only to carry the imports for enemy countries but that there will be a surplus if needed.      Administratively if is impossible for the Ministry of Shipping to continue as at present.   During the war it  has had the  use of the big shipping  organisations all over the world ,, and also the unstinted services cf many prominent shipowners working in the Ministry of Shipping;  tnis obviously cannot continue when the war is over.      SIR JOSEPH COOK said, that one-fifth of our total shipping has been lost in the war and  in consequence the fear is very general that with a smaller number of ships unless  strict control is exercised the rates will  inevitably rise.      MR. CHURCHILL said that  he would not be opposed in principle to giving up Government controls,  and in particular the  control of&quot; tonnage which is  the root  of all  other controls.  The  case for continuing control of raw material and food is  that tonnage is being controlled and rationed and if the control of  tonnage is swept away it may seriously embarrass those responsible for the control of food and raw material.   If  the removal of  Govern- ment control leads to a fall  in the  price  of food,  everybody would welcome it,  but if perchance the shipping were released and the price of food went up,  it  might give rise to a  serious outcry.      MR.. CHURCHILL also explained  that the view of  the Ministry of Shipping that there was now no  tonnage  stringency was  an entirely new idea to him,  he  had always been led to believe that there would be  a serious tonnage  stringency after  the war.      THE SHIPPING CONTROLLER  explained that the fundamental fact was that the estimated requirements  were much less  than  the estimated amount which can be imported into the United  Kingdom. There would he believed be no shortage of  world tonnage  and it was essential to relee.se British tonnage from Government  control.at the  earliest possible date in order that the British Mercan- tile Marine might re-establish itself  in the trades which  it had
 lest during the war.   The Ministry  of Shipping.had yesterday heard that  150,000  tens  of  American additional tonnage had just been released from  Government control in  order that it might take up commercial  work,      As regards rates  of freight, it is a complete fallacy to suppose that  freight is  the main  cause of high prices.  On a 4  lb. loaf  freight  accounts for less than Id. out of about l/3d. (excluding  the  subsidy).  In any  case the present Government rate will be  maintained  as  the maximum for Government cargo. But  it was  hoped  that  if the policy proposed were adopted the commercial  rate might  gradually fall even lower than the Govern- ment rate and then, of course, the  Government rate would disappear altogether as  a separate  rate,      -SIR GEORGE FOSTER explained  that Canada had suffered very seriously from the  shortage of tonnage.  Goods for export had gradually accumulated  and when the  10% space was thrown open there was very serious competition  with the result that the rate of freight  was very J;igh.   If  the amount cf space available were gradually increased as proposed by the Ministry of Shipping the  amount  of space available  would gradually overtake the amount of cargo offered  and the rate would fall.  The Ministry of Shipping must keep  control  of  the vessels&apos; voyages,  but they cannot oontrol the  commercial  freight.  The best thing they can do is to increase  the percentage of space available for  ordinary  commercial cargoes until ultimately a time arrives v/hen they can abolish  the difference between Government and commercial  rates.  He  ^as in favour of the Ministry of Shipping proposal.      GZiSERAL  BOTHA referred to the position of South Africa. South  jJTrica  has a considerable quantity of food stuffs to e:.t  but  can get no  shipping.  They have a shipping contract which  cannot  be carried out owing to the fact that the ships have  been requisitioned.  If these  ships are released South Africa will be able to export  her produce.  Unless the Imperial Government  give a lead in going back to normal conditions there will  be  great trouble  in South Africa.   He was,  in favour of Sir  Joseph Maclay&apos;s proposal.     LORD READING drew attention to the fact that nobody had suggested that the policy ef the Ministry of Shipping would be likely to  raise rates.   So  far as rates were concerned, therefore,   at the worst we  should be no worse off and we shouldhave  the advantage of having got British ships back into their original trades,      SIR ALBERT STANLEY said that if the Shipping Controller would  give  an undertaking that all goods which have hitherto&apos; been  imported at the Goverrmicjit rate will not i&apos;n the future pay mere  than the Government rate&quot;%ould be  prepared to support the proposal.     THE SHIPPING CONTROLLER said that  he fas prepared to give that assurance so far  as any assurance  oanreasonably be given.     LORD READING summed up the position by saying that theMinistry of Shipping were not proposing tc give away anything which  they  cannot get  back  if  necessary;  they are only changing, the  form of control so that if  the  rates do,  contrary to expectation, rise ,  the  Ministry cf  Shipping can at  once revert  to the present  system of requisition.
     MR. CHURCHILL said that he was prepared  to  concur  in  the suggested policy provided it was carried into effect gradually.     As regards shipbuilding,  Sir Albert Stanley explained thatif standard shins were sold to foreigners,  the position of theBoard of Trade in relation to its duties under the  TransferRestriction Acts, might be difficult,  as &quot;British shipownerswould press for permission to sell their old  ships  to foreigners     THE SHIPPING CONTROLLER said that he thought that  thedifficulty could be got over.     After further disoussion the Meeting decided unanimouslyto approve the policy in regard to shipping and  shipbuildingset out in the Ministry of Shipping memoranda G.T.6472  and 6482.i2,  Whitehall  Gardens,  S.W.23rd December,  1918.
