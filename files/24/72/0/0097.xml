                       ^&quot;7       AThis Document is the Property of./4     His  Qntannic Majesty&apos;a Government.)/O)  AERIAL NAVIGATION  BILL 1919       Memorandum to Cabinet.ET.  is^m,**^Bsass5SSS^       Civil  flying  in this  country has been prohibited           since  August 2nd 1914 under  the General Order of the Home           Secretary issued on that date under the authority of the           Aerial Navigation Acts 1911  and 1913,                                                    *                   It is  not possible to maintain this prohibition           indefinitely and an early relaxation permitting civilian           flying is pressed for by public opinion.                   The enormous  development  of aviation since 1914           precludes a return  to the unrestricted flying lawful up to           July 1914,  when it  was open  to anyone to fly without any test           of  the pilot1s competency or  of the airworthiness of the           machine,  and further  securities for the safety of the public,           particularly those  travelling In  passenger machines, are           considered essential.   This&quot;policy was considered essential           by  the Civil Aerial  Transport Committee whose view has been           generally accepted  as sound.                   The Aerial  navigation Acts 1911 and 1913, while           authorising the imposition of conditions upon the flight           of  aircraft coming  from abroad, do not empower a Secretary           of  State to do more  as regards aircraft in this country than           to  prescribe areas  over which, flight is forbidden.                   These  safeguards being inadequate to-day, an           International  Conference is  to be held at Paris to draw up           a Convention,  to he  followed  by a comprehensive domestic           enactment based on  the Convention regulating the whole           position of aircraft  here,                   Considerable  time will be required to get the           Convention agreed and to pass a comprehensive Act through           Parliament.   The alternative courses are (1) to wait for           that and to retain  the present absolute prohibition of civil           flying (2)  to  obtain temporary powers by Act of Parliament           to  regulate civil flying in  the interests of public safety           pending the passage  of accomprehensive Act.                   The situation has been discussed.at various meetings           with the Society of  British Aircraft Constructors and there           is  general a re emeu t that temporary measures must be taJlen.           Safeguards are obviously desirable in the interest of thys           aircraft industry Itself which would be jeopardised in the           public view by mishaps attributable to lack of publio           regulation and supervision.                   The Bill of  which a  draft is attached. Is accordingly           for War Cabinet approval.   It empowers a Secretary of State           (who will be the Secretary of State for the Royal Air Force)           to  control all civilian flying in this country by requiring           a licence in each case and compelling the licencee to           conform to orders made  by the Secretary of State under the           Act.    The orders will be published In the London Gazette           and laid before Parliament, becoming operative however from           the date of publication^P.T.0,
        The conditions embodied in the licence will be Ibroadly on the lines recommended by the Civil Aerial MTransport Committee supplemented by the teachings of relflying experience.        I would urge that this matter should receive thiconsideration Of the War Cabinet within say the next teidays and that stops may be taken to press the suggestedbill through Parliament right at the opening of the new session.3/1/19.(Si).
