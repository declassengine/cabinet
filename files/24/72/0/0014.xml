UKJKT IS TEE PROPERTY OP LTI3 Bli I T after IC * I I A J&apos;1&apos;J.. T Y1S GOVSAlfA hrTC ft 3 I 11 E T.WETILLIED  OPERATION  IK RUSOIA.Mote by htr,G,N..Barnes,(Previous  apers G.T.631-1,, 6433,-Ad442, &amp; 64$0.)          I feel sure there is a very  general  feeling  of uneasinessin regard to Allied.operations in  dussis, es  eeially An the part  ofsome of our womenfolk.   They are&apos;  afraid th- t  their men,, now havingfought the Germans, may be sent to fight the  Aus dens4  They are.obsessed with the idea that &quot;oa italist&quot; Governments are disposed to make war upon what they regard  as a socialist government inRussia.   This idea is being fostered  by a  section of  the labour  and ;Socialist Press, although I note quite recently, (within the last week or two in fact) t that the more responsible  leaclers of  the labour  &quot;artyare now becoming anti-Bolshevists  an  are talking loudly about light in-&quot;the Bolshevist here at home.           In order to help on thia -:nti-Bolshevist feeling,  the.iross ought to be saturated v/ith statements as  to  what Bolshevism inRussia really     1 means.  I have not yet myself  seen IiOckharfs reporton Russia, but I know from other sources that Bolshevism has  reduced the Russian population to starvation, and, 01 course everybody knows ina general way how &quot;Russia has been reduced to    position of unprecedenteddegradation anA humiliation.  These things ou ht to be  adebeing repeated in the Ares a,known by           I think that we should be careful not  to co rait  ourselves to unnece sary inroc As into Russia.  The repor a  from Eastern Siberiain regard to the condition of the railways and the desertion of therailway employees are not at all encouraging.  We have men  now far remove-  ed from vladivostock, and it seems to me there  is some danger of their being cut of:,..  I should like to  e the&apos; Czecho-Slovaks go eastward assoon as posible, so that they may get away home, an -. if that were done,I should certainly do nothing none to support the Eastern SiberianGovernment than we have hone.  There may be a better case for&apos;the protection of the border states from the Baltic to the Black Sea,  becauseof the risk of Bolshevism spreading westward, - but aha utmost I ahoul-be disposed to assent to there,  &apos; ould be arming of the people to protectthemselves. -            I : m somewhat concerned moreover, in regard to the -Northernforces,.   I note prog 0 sals made for an expedition to hetrograd, aided  *by forces - f governments the Baltic.  Mow that the Aangor on the litirmanj  coast isgone,  I REE no adequate reason for such an EX.&quot;edition.  It is true that*e are in honour bound to see alter those - ho have helped us.  But allthat we , re Bound, to do in that res- ec- ,: ou&quot;&apos; : be to arm them and. drillthorn,  and  I Ahouls not  e disposed to commit ourselves to anything fur-theiw         -  Putting it *jenerall;v,. I -chink our policy should be to extricate&apos; ourselves as speedily as possible from Rufeaia..   Publicopinion in this country would, sot support us, in an offensive against th
the Bolshevists,    It wouia  ho  a very large tuodertaldjag,  withouadequate  justification  or  reasonable  prospect  of success.  Ibelieve that Bolshevism will come to  a natural end,   It is a fto be consumed from vlthin rather than a  some thin.&apos;  to be  foughtfrom vim.out,                                                  \           I am sis- osed to  ru..;vo t Mr, 5&apos;i sherds proposal  thatthe whole question  of Husf..ian settlement  might be  submitted tothe Veaco Canierenee as early as ^os  ible,  so  th.\t,  if necessaryrepresentative&quot; my bo  sent  for  x-om  ,ms: ia itself  to confertogether.           I noted  recently  a statement by  Litvinoff that the bolshevist Government was  disposed to  go  a  long way to satisfy the Allied Governments,  Tin&quot;! may indicate  some inclination tomja  ane policy on their  sart,  and might be del  ed on  by contact vthe 11 on-Bolshevik governments of Outer Rus  la.    But the  settle!of Ail&apos;/ i,- is   mattex primarily for Russians themselves ane not for us,  and the utmost  that  we  should  do  is to afford them evenfacility for settling into sanity,                              (initialled)G, .N.   3,2, Whitehall Gardens,                sV./,l19th &quot;December 1918,
