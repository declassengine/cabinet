                            ftCOMMITTEE  OP  ENQUIRY  INTO  BREACHES  OF                THE  LAWS  OF  WAR.         INTERIM REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE.    1. At the first meeting of the Committee held in  Committee  Room No. 5 at the House of Commons on 6th November, 1918,  the Attorney-General  in  the Chair,  the  Attorney-General de-  livered the following address to the Committee:           THE  ATTORNEY-GENERALS  ADDRESS.  The ATTORNEY-GENERAL :  Gentlemen,  the object of our meeting  here to-night is known to all of you, but it appeared to me that  it might be convenient if, at this the first meeting of the Com-  mittee, I made a few general  observations which may remind  you of the circumstances under which this Committee has  been  asked  by the Government to undertake  certain duties.   The  general points affecting the whole sanction of Public Law which.  have been raised by this War are well  known  to all of  you,  Many of you have  written,  and written with great weight and  authority about them, and all of you have thought and spoken  about  them.  I can very shortly  describe  them.   We do  not,  at  this stage,  invite or  propose  to consider other views  upon  this question.  Our  own view  is that an aggressive  War was  forced upon the world, by an ambitious and  unscrupulous power,  and that the challenge so developed involved the whole future  of  the Public Law of States.   In other  words,  the  challenge  which proceeded from Germany meant this, and it meant nothing  else: We think that we are strong enough to conquer the world;  believing ourselves strong enough to conquer the world we care  nothing for all the doctrines of International Law; if we  win,  and we are convinced that  we are strong  enough to win,  the  inherent weakness of International Law immediately makes itself  manifest, in other words, inasmuch as  we shall be the conqueror,  inasmuch as International Law has no sanctions which it can  apply to the conqueror, it is a matter of the most complete indif-  ference to  us whether in the judgment of those,  whom by our  hypothesis we shall  have vanquished, we have  broken Inter  national Law or not.    Gentlemen, it is necessary  freely to admit that  had Germany  been right in. her anticipation of the result of this struggle, the  view which  that country had  formed of  the  future  of Inter-  national Law would have been  well  founded; in other words,  if the weight of  those doctrines had been defeated by a power  which in  the first place had publicly challenged  them, and  in  the  second place had made good  that challenge by the success  of her arms, public law and the sanctity of treaties would  have  disappeared in our day and our generation from the world.   The,  German Empire,  assisted by her Allies, made this  challenge and
F  submitted it now for four and a half years to the arbitrament  inns.  It is, indeed, fortunate for us  and our Allies, and it  orturiate for the whole cause of civilisation that that challenge  failed.  For observe the consequences of failure.  The point  issential difference between Municipal Law and International  T has long been a  commonplace with those who have written  hought upon such subjects.  In our Municipal Laws punish-  lt waits upon the wrong doer, and  the presence  of punishmentimmediate,  inevitable is  one of  the primary and  essential[ :&apos;ks  of a  civilised community.   All of us have  been  familiar,  those, who have contributed immeasurable industry and great  Piling to the gradual evolution of the doctrine of Internationa]  V, have been well aware of the weakness of  International Law  n this point.  But they have been content to believe, since  day when the genius and the humanity of Grotius first created  foundations upon  which the great doctrines of InternationalAV were  to be built, that there  would never be such a  retro-^ssion into savagery that any great community would challengei^e doctrines with the result  of Hinging the whole world backe: n civilisation  into a welter of savagery.   Gentlemen, thatli Uenge  was made.  As I have said, happily and providentially,  i how narrow a margin of success few even of those who  here know  completely, only those can. know completely who  e partaken  of the immediate secrets of the Government  in  last four and a half years it  has failed  and it has defini-  ily failed, and the  question has now arisen,  what steps  ought)i )e taken, not for the purpose of wreaking any spirit of idleijclictiveness,  but for the purpose of re-establishing the  autho-   of  International  Law.  I hope,  gentlemen,  and I believe  i when  we say, as  we say to-day,  that we  are  determined to  s any  steps that  are necessary to reassert, and to reassert  er  circumstances  of  the  utmost  possible  notoriety,  the1 liority  of those doctrines,  that we  say  so not in the spirit ofVI who  are greatly  concerned to exercise or take pleasure  inQfcising punitive functions  (I do not think that is in the minds  ny  of us) but looking as far as we can with cool and passion-  eyes into the future of theWorld,  we are determined that our  dren and our grandchildren, and  those even who come aftertin, shall be spared what this generation has gone  through.  us it seems that the most effective  deterrent of  all is that foripges men who are tempted  to follow the wicked and the bloody   which  the Governors of the Central Empires have trodden  ing  the last four years, shall have present before their eyes,  a picture merely of the brilliant and meretricious  glamour  military success, but also the recollection  that in this  great  fiict  punishment  attended  upon  crime.  Gentlemen,  it  is  ain  that in  the events that have taken place in the last four  a-half  years many great crimes  against International  Law  e been committed.&quot; That conclusion is not  very  vigorously luted even in Germany to-day.  The very origin of the  War,  violation of Belgium,  will for all time,  I  think, be reniem-  d in the pages of history as one of  the greatest crimes against  isation.  I  do not invite  you,  it wrould  not be possible that 1 a  task  should be  imposed upon you,  to consider how  far a J0962                                                A 4,
ia:dgiven individual should be made responsible for the highestall the crimes against civilisation.   The enquiry into the orij &quot;0of the War cannot usefully be undertaken by you.  As to tincrimes, which necessarily raise questions of the highest and mdelicate politics, I think it probable that you will deem it necsary to make  certain investigations of fact,    But  the  grq-questions  of  policy which will then  be  raised can obviously .dealt with neither by you, nor by me.  They must be dealt wi \by  Councils in which all the Allies will be represented.  Soas the examination of documents, so far as the statement of c( jelusions upon questions of fact are concerned, I think that even .relation to those the highest  questions of all you may rent ,a very useful contribution, but it is evident that the work to whi &apos;you can  most usefully  contribute at  least I  think  this wemerge  as your enquiries proceed will be that of fixing a.assigning  responsibility for specific breaches  of  Internatioi  Law in very many branches and  departments of the War.   Inot pretend to attempt an  exhaustive classification of those cabecause to do so would be to attempt a history of the War, butI select one  single illustration it is  because in relation to tbranch of the enquiry there has been already very considerainvestigation.  I have in my mind the case  of wrongs and oi&quot;rages and crimes which have been committed upon the  bodiesprisoners of Avar.  There are obviously very many other matters that class to which you may devote yourselves.  But it is far fixbeing my  purpose even by suggestion, because I cannot preteto have considered this matter as deeply as it  will very  sobecome your duty to  consider it,  to attempt to give you a clasfication of the various branches of the subject to which you wprobably think  it necessary  to devote your  attention  and  yotime.  I may, however,  perhaps  usefully read to you the Terof Reference and you will then see what generally is the workwhich the War  Cabinet has asked you to devote yourselves.  The  Terms of Reference are expressed in the  following If ^guage:  The Law Officers of  the  Crown have  been authorising -by the War Cabinet to appoint a Committee  to enquire into aireport upon the following: (1)  The facts as&apos; to breaches of tlaws and customs of Avar, affecting members of the British AnnForces or  other  British subjects,  committed by the Forces of german Empire and  their Allies on Land,  on  Sea,  and in 1Air, during the present War.  I pause to make an observation upon that.   As many memhof this Committee will  be aware there  is already  in  existenin France a Committee which has devoted itself,  I  cannot tyou, with precise accuracy, to how many of  the problems whiare suggested by the very general language of this first pa:^graph of the Reference, but it is  within  my knowledge  that th ^have devoted themselves to many  questions  affecting the  tre nment by the Germans of French prisoners of war,  and mc rjparticularly to the treatment of the French  inhabitants in wlare usually known as the occupied  regions.  It will  certainbecome necessary at  some stage  of your enquiries that Liaisibe  established between  the  French Committee and your Comittee,  and  proper steps  will be taken by  your officers to iygc(1e;1
e:317 HI C It rt * e 31&apos; f;il! 1     such Liaison is conducted  in the most convenient manner.    per facilities will be given by &quot;the Government for such inter-  ? ununication as may become  necessary either in this country  1 n France between your Committee and any Committee formed  e my other of the Allies to enquire into similar matters.  &apos; lie second  paragraph  of the Reference is:  &quot;The degree of  3ionsibility for these offences  attaching to particular members  vhe German forces, including the German General Staff, or  &apos; ;r highly  placed individuals; (3) The constitution and pro-    are  of a tribunal APPROPRIATE to  the trial of these offences;    Any other matters cognate or ancillary to the above which    1 arise in the oourse of the Enquiry, and which the Committee    s it useful or relevant to take into consideration.&quot;    lie words in which clause 4 of the Reference are drafted have    ii very deliberately adopted.  Their object is that the Com-    tee should feel itself at liberty, without any limitation at all,   ise its own  discretion to apply itself to any subject cognate to   se more  precisely indicated,  the exploration of which in their   gment may prove  fruitful   to the  general purpose of  the    eminent, and I hope  that the Committee  &quot;will consider that    War Cabinet so far  from wishing to limit in any way the   ge of their Enquiry,  has rather given an  indication of the   tidence which  they place in  the Committee, having regard to   constitution for which equally with the Law Officers they are    lonsible, by leaving it so  entirely in their discretion as is   icated in clause 4.   That precisely shall be the  range of their enquiries?  I am    lorised  to state to the Committee that it is the intention of    Government to give  them any  assistance in any  facilities    ch may be  required.  It is obvious that the general range of   uiry  for which  the Committee  will  be  responsible involves   uy  departmental and  inter-departmental  questions and all    Departments of the Government will receive formal and clear   ructions that they are to&apos; assist the Committee by  supplying    ence, or by sending, if it be necessary, witnesses before them,   making all relevant documents admissible, and in short in any    which  may suggest itself to the Committee as being useful.   h instructions  either have already been given or will be given   1 the very constitution  of the  Committee itself,  embracing as it   s very responsible members  representing the War Office, the   iniralty and. the Foreign Office, will guarantee that the efforts   the Committee will  not at least fail through the.lack of au-   ritative  information.  I  have, I think, only to add  this,  in   h matters the  responsibility  of the  Law Officers  is  perhaps  perly considered one which  arises at  a later stage.  My col-P?sjue and  I,  as  of course  everybody knows,  have  the respon-  :lity of giving  definite and final advice in such matters to the^eminent before decisions  are taken, and this  Committee,  litly looked  AT; must be regarded as a Committee which  has   n good enough to assist my colleague, the Solicitor-General,  1 myself  at a time when the  burdens which are imposed upon  are very weighty and very numerous, by clearing the ground  order to  make  certain preliminary enquiries.  I need hardly    that either, or both  of  us,  will  always be  available if any y.&apos;e:irlin).friifiinlte:t  1VLI m w ai: ai CJo
 point of special complication arises in which it is thought by Committee that our presence will he useful; we shall  be  ahvj ready  to attend and the Committee  must take the view that shall at any moment be willing to mark our sense of the servit which  the Committee is rendering to the Government by making any contribution which it is in our power as Law Officers to mal   JSTow gentlemen, it is of course necessary that you  should ha a  Chairman,  and a Vice-Chairman  and  Secretaries.  I do even venture to forecast  the method  which you may judge to the most convenient method of  carrying out  the laborious quiries which will become necessary, but I venture to  anticip that you will  soon  form the conclusion that  some  sub-divisions of your labours will be required.    The subject-matter of yc enquiries is varied, many subjects are raised, and it may be tl you will consider it  a  convenient course to sub-divide yoursel and to  form sub-committees in order to present reports, to the mi Committee.    The Government  have  thought  it  right  at 1 outset  to inform you,  as I do to-day,  that if  in your  discreti the number of those  sub-Committees makes an  undue strain up the  personnel of the  main Committee, that  we give you  fr discretion to co-opt  such persons as may lie suitable to ass you in any subordinate  or  further  enquiries  that may becoj necessary.  I need hardly point  out  to you that expedition is j very great importance.  Events  move  so  rapidly to-day  thati] may be that at least a preliminary recommendation might prig \to be valuable in a period of time which may be very short, ani would  therefore venture  to  urge  upon you as  far as it maypossible-most  of those who are serving here have other  dutto perform, and indeed  if  they  were  not in  the  habit of  icharging other duties  competently they would  hardly  bo herat the same time, making all due allowance for that circumstaiidespatch is a very important part of your duties.  I would  thfore venture, as far  as circumstances permit,  to urge  upon  ;the importance of despatch.   It has become necessary, of courjfor the Government  to consider the question of who shouldcharge the duties which belong  to  a  chairman and to a vichairman and secretaries.  Here  again, of course, we  shouldextremely unwilling in any way to  fetter the  discretion ofCommittee, but after very careful consideration  I have decided!recommend to you the following names,  making it  quite c\that the  discretion of the Committee is in no  way fetteredthe first  place  it is  proposed,  and I do propose it to  you, t! Sir John Macdonell  should be the Chairman of this  CommiThe name of Sir John Macdonell is known to every studentInternational Law; his public services, his courtesy as  a Mas!his great learning, need no words of  mine and I cannot lithinking that you will be fortunate,  if you  should shareview, in  obtaining a Chairman of his  industry and  of his great attainments and knowledge.  I propose also that  Professc I do not know whether  I ought not to call him Captain MorgaProfessor and Captain Morgan, whose authority on ConstituticLaw is known to all of you, and  who has the  very great ad\tage of having made  many preliminary researches  and a nmasterly report upon  the earlier  outrages of the War,  she
tosis vv, undertake the duties of Vice-Chairman, and I understand he is   irilling, if that  be  your wish,  to  undertake  those duties.  The vi (fork of the Secretaries is hardly less important than that of the   hairman and Vice-Chairman, and I think you  will agree  with lame that we have been fortunate in securing two gentlemen as joint h Secretaries of the Committee from whose industry and knowledge   if the subject I  expect, and I think the Committee will expect,   eery great results.   Dr. Hugh H. L. Bellot and Mr. J. E. G.  de   Uontmorency are both  willing, if it be the pleasure of the Com-   committee, to undertake the duties of Secretaries.   I would, there-   ore, venture to make a  comprehensive motion, thinking this may   wt  prove  in practice to be inconvenient, but susceptible at any   mint  of  amendment, that Sir  John  Macdonell and  Professor ei Morgan  lie appointed respectively Chairman and Vice-Chairman nnf the Committee and that Dr. Bellot, and Mr. de Montmorency   ie  appointed  Secretaries.  I  have only to add, in conclusion, etjiefore I formally put  that motion, that the  Government fully   ealises the sacrifice  which busy men are being asked to make  in  jiving up their time, and so much of their time, to this Enquiry,  nit  realising that they  nevertheless do  not hesitate to make the (lemand, because  they sincerely believe that there never has been   moment in  the history of  civilisation in which it was in the  lower of a conquering country or of conquering Allies to do more  o assert and place upon a firm foundation for all time the sourcesmmd  the  only  sources upon which  public law  can depend  and  urvive.   I beg to move  that these gentlemen be appointed officers.  Is  t your pleasure that those names be adopted  as  the Chairman,ei^ice-Chairman and  Secretaries of the Committee?   If there is no other suggestion  or name that proposal  is carried  tnd  I will ask Sir John Macdonell to take the Chair.  I myself  nust go to other  duties now,  and I will only  add once again    think I am speaking for my colleague as well as for myself   hat  we  are both at  any time entirely  at the  disposal of  the   ommittee. uasc ilaI&apos;1!aylumthtioulb)fdei  c 1 iiit en las t e S A !SSC gn iti(a(bl ishePROCEEDINGS OE THE COMMITTEE.  2. At the outset of our enquiry we found it necessary, as sug- ested by the Attorney-General, to divide the subjects covered bymr Terms of Reference under various heads, and to refer these  Sub-Committees for detailed  investigation  of the immensenass of material already collected and to be collected; the offences,or instance,  alleged to have been committed on land amountingo many  thousands of  cases.   These heads  fell naturally  into director divisions, viz. :&apos;- (1) Breaches of the Laws of &quot;War on Land.2) Breaches of the Laws at Sea and  in the  Air; and (3) the Law iplicable to  such breaches. Accordingly, three Sub-Committees were  appointed, viz.: (1) lie Sub-Committee for Offences on Land; (2) The Sub-committee or Offences at Sea and in the  Air;  (3) The Sub-Committee on aw.   Subsequently it was found convenient to appoint a separateub-Committee to  deal with offences committed from  the Air,
,IIH1 on December 19th, .19.18, a Sub-Committee for Offences in tlAir was appointed.  3, The first question to engage tlie attention of the Committewas the determination of the nature of the Tribunal to be createfor the trial and punishment of offences deemed contrary to &quot; t]laws and customs of war and the laws of humanity &quot;-and of tlconstitution of the Tribunal.  After discussion as to whether the Tribunal to be created shoulbe of a National or of an International character, it was resolveby the Committee at their meeting on November 19th, 1918, tk&quot; an International  Tribunal be established, composed of rept,sentafives of the Chief Allied States and the United States for tltrial and punishment of offences contrary to the laws and  custoiof war and the laws of humanity,&quot; and that such &quot; Inter-AllieTribunal be empowered to sit in Divisions  to try such cases amight  be assigned to them by the Inter-Allied Tribunal, and icases peculiarly affecting the subjects of  any one nationality tlmajority of  a Division might consist of national members.&quot;  4.  It was further resolved by the Committee that it be provideby the Treaty of Peace, or preferably by some earlier arrangemeat:    &quot;That the enemy Governments shall recognise the jurisdictioof the said Tribunal, that all enemy persons alleged to have beeguilty  of offences against the laws and customs of war and tllaws of humanity  shall  be excluded from any amnesty to whicthe belligerents may agree, and  that the Governments  of  suepersons shall undertake  to surrender them to be tried by the salTribunal.&quot;  5. It was resolved by the  Committee  &quot; that  in the  even of it proving impossible to  secure the consent of the Allied anlAssociated Governments to  the establishment of an Inter-AllielTribunal, the British Government be recommended to take step!to establish a National Court.&quot;                             j  (i. On November 21st, .1918, a special and wholly independeii 1reference  was made by the Attorney-General to  a  Special  SulCommittee,  consisting of the members of the Sub-Committee oi!Law,  together with  the  Chairman, Vice-Chairman,  Mr.  JusticiPeterson and  Mr. C. A.  Gill, with a request to report to hiiidirectly, with as  little delay as  possible  and without  waitiiij!for a  meeting  of  the  Main  Committee,  upon the  followinj]questions:      (1) Whether it is desirable to take  proceedings against tli           German Kaiser?    (2) What  should  be the  nature  and  constitution  of  til           Tribunal for the trial of the German Kaiser ?    (3) What should be the  chief  heads of the charges  to m           preferred against him?    (4) What should he the law to be applied by the  Tribunal? 1    (5) What should be its procedure?  7. On  November 28th, 19.18, the Report,  as adopted by tbSpecial Sub-Committee was  presented to the Attorney-General.&apos;* For this Report gee p. 95.
   8. On November 29th, upon the instructions of  the Sub-Corn- mittee on Law, the Secretary, Dr.  Bellot, drafted the  Ink/im Report to  be  submitted  to  the  Committee  for  approval and adoption.   9. On December 1st,  the Secretary received a communication from Sir Maurice  ilankey, Secretary to the War Cabinet, asking for a copy of the Committee&apos;s Report.    Dr. Bellot  forwarded a  copy of the Report mentioned in  para. 7, and also  a  copy  of the Interim Report of the Sub-Committee on  Law  mentioned  in para. 8, with a letter stating that it was only his draft,  based upon the Sub-Committee&apos;s instructions,  and that it had not yet received the final  approval of  the Committee.   .10. In his reply acknowledging the receipt of the two Reports, Sir  Maurice Hanlcey stated  that,  acting  upon the  Attorney- GeneraFs instructions, lie had circulated the  Interim  Report to the Imperial War Cabinet with the following note :        &quot; This Report  lias not received the formal sanction of the    Law Officers of the Crown, but  is circulated  by them as a    contribution towards the  discussion, of the question of the j  attitude of the Allies towards the ex-Kaiser.&quot;   11. On December 2nd, .1918, at a  Conference of the  Govern- nients  of  France, Great Britain and Italy,  it was agreed  to recommend that a demand ought to  be presented to Holland for the  surrender  of  the person  of the Kaiser  for  trial  by an International Court.  12. In pursuance of a request from the Attorney-General for expedition,  the   following   Recommendations  of the  Main Committee  were forwarded to  him, in an Interim  Report  dated 19th December, 1918.      1.3.

(.1), and shall determine  (subject to Recommendations IV. (7) and IV.  (8) IIOAV the  Divisions  of the Tribunal shall be composed from  time to time, and shall assign to each Division the cases to be tried by it.   (10) That at any stage of a case assigned to a Division for trial, it may be referred by such Division to the Full Court or may be transferred to  the Full Court by order thereof.   (11) That the Full Court and any  Division of the Tribunal have power to appoint  assessors to assist it in the trial of any particular  case or class of cases.   (12) That in the event  of it proving impossible to  secure the consent of the Allied and Associated Governments to the  estab- lishment of an International Tribunal, the British Government be recommended to take steps to establish a National Court for the trial of offences against  British subjects. V.-THE LAW TO BE APPLIED BY THE TRIBUNAL.  That the IOAV to be applied by the Tribunal be &quot; the principlesof the LaAv of  Nations as they result from the usages  established among&apos; civilised peoples,  from the laws  of humanity and  the dictates of public  conscience,&quot; and in particular the regula-tions contained in  the Hague Conventions and Declarations andthe Geneva Conventions so far  as the same or any of them maybe applicable.VI.-POAVER OF  PUNISHMENT.  When the accused  is found by the Tribunal to  have committed an act in breach of the  laws and customs of&apos; war or the  laws of humanity  with which,  he is charged,  the Tribunal  shall havepoAver to  sentence him to  such punishment  as  it shall thinkproper,
 VII. PROCEDURE OF THE  TRIBUNAL.   (1)  That tho accused be entitled at all stages of the proceed- ings to be represented by  counsel or&apos; other legal  advisers, or, subject to the permission of the Court, by any other person whom he may nominate.   (2)  That the charges against the accused specify clearly the alleged offences, that they be in writing, and that copies of them be given to him and his legal adviser in a reasonable time before the trial.   (3)  That the Court  have power  to amend any  defect in the charges at any  stage of the proceedings.   (4)  That the accused be supplied with  a list of witnesses for the prosecution with their names and descriptions, and a  sum- mary of the evidence to be given by each of them; but this shall not preclude the Court from  admitting  the  evidence of  such witnesses as it shall think proper, notwithstanding  that  their names  are not included in such list.   (5) That,  except by permission  of  the Court,  the evidence be given orally, and that  the  evidence  and  the arguments be heard in open Court.   (6) That the witnesses be liable to cross-examination.   (7) That a   bare  majority  of   the  judges  determine  the decision of the Court as to  guilt and sentence, except  in case of liability to a death  sentence, in which case the majority should consist  of not less than two-thirds of those present.   (8) That the judgment be given publicly by the Court as such, and that it should state the reasons  upon which it is based.   (9) That in  fixing the punishment &quot;the Court may take  into account extenuating circumstances.   (.10)  That  if  the  accused, having been duly cited,  does not appear, the Court  may proceed in  his absence,  and  may give judgment upon the evidence at its disposal.   (11)  That the Court officially notify to the accused, so far as is practicable, the decision arrived at  in his absence.   (.12)  That the Full Court have power  without re-hearing to revise  any sentence passed by  a Division of the International Tribunal, but subject to this power,  the  sentence passed by a Division shall take effect, unless within fourteen days  from the passing thereof  objection shall  have been taken to any irregular- clarity in  the proceedings.  Such objection shall be heard  and determined by the Full  Court, and in the meantime the execution of the  sentence  shall be suspended.  &quot;(13)  Sentences&apos; to  be  imposed by  the Court shall be carried into effect by such persons and in such manner as may  be deter- mined  by the Chief  Allied States and the United States. VIII.-RULES OF EVIDENCE TO BE APPLIED BY THE TRIBUNAL. &quot;  It is  not considered  desirable to  offer  any  suggestion  as to evidence; a matter which may safely be left to the Court which no doubt will take precautions to exclude  irrelevant matter. ! - It is  obviously impossible to apply English rules of evidence to  the  proceedings  of a Court the  majority of the members ofwhich may be unfamiliar with such  rules.
 IX. CHARGES TO LE PREFERRED BEFORE THE TRIBUNAL.   The enquiries of the Committee have not reached a stage  at which it is possible to state precisely the charges which should be preferred against offenders&apos;.  The Committee are still engaged in investigating these charges.    Subject,  therefore,  to  recon- sideration and  modification the  following heads  of charges are provisionally suggested, viz. :       (1) Systematic Terrorism in Belgium, Prance and elsewhere.     (2) Wanton  Devastation,  Destruction   of  Property,  and           Pillage.     (3) Illegal Levies.     (4) Illegal Executions.     (5) Deportation of Civil Population in Occupied Territories           and  Forced Labour.     (G) Murder of Hostages..     (7) Indiscriminate Bombardment from the Air.     (8) Indiscriminate Bombardment from the Sea.     (9)  Illegal Methods of Submarine  or other Naval  Warfare.    (10)  Destruction of Hospital  Ships.    (11)  Wilful or  Reckless Bombardment of Hospitals.    (12)  Ill-Treatment of Prisoners of War.    (13)  Directions  to give &quot; No Quarter.&quot;    (14)  Use  of  Illegal Methods of Warfare.   The Committee desire to point out that if  it be determined to bring  before the Tribunal  for trial persons who  are responsible for the infringement of the Neutrality of Belgium or luxembourg - burg,  or for  commencing the war, it will be  necessary that the Terms of Peace shall expressly  provide  for their  surrender and trial, and their punishment, if they be  found guilty of the act or acts with which they are charged,  and that the provisions relative to disclosure of documents must be extended in order to cover such cases.  These Recommendations cover  a  considerable  portion of the matters  referred to the Committee under the terms  of  their Reference.  They deal Avith  subjects upon which the enquiries of the  Committee are still far from complete.   In view, however, of the urgent necessity for despatch, the  Committee have  pre- sented  the   above Recommendations  without  stating   their reasons, which will  be submitted  subsequently.  In conclusion, the  Committee  desire to express their strongopinion that the Article or Articles in the  Treaty  of Peace pro- viding for jurisdiction over enemy offenders should, if  possible,he drawn in the most comprehensive terms.               Signed on behalf of the Committee,                        (Signed)    JOHN  MACDONELL. &apos;  19th December, 1918.  14.  The Committee now proceed to give their reasons  for theabove Recommendations.
         REASONS  FOE  RECOMMENDATIONS.                        JURISDICTION.  15.  The  Committee  are of opinion that the jurisdiction to try the offences referred  to them should be based on the laws and usages  of  war as observed  by  civilised  nations.    Beforestating these reasons for this conclusion,  we may briefly mentionsome other suggested foundations for jurisdiction.   They are., itseems to us, uncertain, insufficient or inapplicable.  We namethem only to show that they have not been overlooked.  16.  The terms of reference chiefly  relate  to offences committedagainst British subjects.   These fall into four classes, according as they were committed (1)  upon British territory (e.g, air-raidsupon undefended towns); (2) in British  territorial  waters (e,g.,the torpedoing of merchant ships without warning); (3) upon theHigh   Seas  in  similar circumstances;  and  (4)  upon  foreignterritory.  Are  these offences  or  any of them  &quot; crimes &quot;  according toEnglish law?   In other words,  is there any Court which, by the laws of this country,  has  jurisdiction to try and punish thepersons who have committed them ?                  ENGLISH CRIMINAL LAW.  IT.  As to the  first  class, offences committed upon british territory by enemy subjects during a  state of war, there are grave doubts  whether  they  are  triable  at English  Common Law.According to one view,  all such  offences are  cognisable, while war war exists, only by military tribunals.  In support of this opinion is quoted the dictum of Hale :       &quot; When it is tempus belli within the kingdom  and one    either steals, robs or plunders the house or goods of another    .   .  .  tho&apos; these kind of offences  committed by  those of    the same  party, or  those  that  are  not in hostility one to    another, are  felonies, yet in the time of war, when done hy    an enemy,  they put  on another  name  as  acts of hostilities,    misprision, and the like.&quot;*  There is  also the dictum  of  Coke  (Inst.,  4th part, 123),  &quot;tothe constable  it  appertained  to have  conusance  of  contracts and deeds of amis, and  war out of  the Kingdom, and also ofthings  which touch Avar within the realm, which cannot be deter -mined  or discussed  by the Common  Law.&quot;  But such  dicta, ifstrictly true, are, it is said, on the  other hand, consistent withthe doctrine that even  in a state of war, when the ordinary Courtsare open,  they possess jurisdiction  as to certain matters, e.g.,when acts of violence  are done  by one of the belligerents not inaccordance with, but  contrary  to, the laws and usages of war.At all events, the law as to this point is  not expressly coveredby authority and is  uncertain.* Pleas of the Crown I. 565.
   18. As to the second class of offences, those committed in Britishterritorial waters, Section 2 of the Territorial Waters JurisdictionAct, .1878, provides that any offence on the high seas  within oneleague of the coast, though committed in a foreign ship by a non-British subject,  may be tried as if within the Admiralty  juris-diction.   The exact  scope  of  this  section has not, so  far  as we know,  been judicially  determined,* and its validity from thepoint of view of international law  has been disputed  by foreignwriters.t  The section appears to do no more than permit exerciseof  the  Admiralty criminal  jurisdiction  within the  three-milezone.  It does not contemplate  acts done during a state of war,and affords no certain ground of jurisdiction.   19. As to the third class of  offences,  acts committed on thehigh seas, the same observation  applies-the Admiralty criminal law dealt  with  offences committed in time of peace.    Nor cansuch acts be regarded as acts of piracy, the essence of which is,that the  wrongful acts  are done without the  authority of theState whose subject the pirate is or whose flag he flies.   The acts -of  commissioned vessels are not   piracy.   As  Hall remarks,&quot; most acts which become  piratical through being done withoutauthority, are acts of  war when done under  the authority of  astate.&quot;J    Even if  the  acts  were those of  non-commissionedvessels, those who committed them would not be triable as piratesif they were  the subjects  of  a  State at  war  with  us.jj  CokeIIsays, in  effect,  that, if the subjects of different States commitrobbery upon  each other upon the High Seas, if their respectiveStates  be at enmity it is not piracy, for it is a general rule thatenemies can never commit piracy on each other, their depredationsbeing deemed  mere acts of hostility.  20. The great majority of the acts which  are the  subject ofour enquiry were committed on foreign territory by subjects offoreign States.   Such wrongful  acts were never offences at Com-mon Law,  even  in time of peace.  When  ex-territorial acts havebeen made punishable by statute,  they have been held, on theprinciples  laid down in R.  v. Jameson^  and E. v. Keyn,** toapply to the acts of British subjects and not to those of aliens.  The  conclusion to  which, on  the whole, we come is, that noEnglish  Court,  administering the ordinary criminal law, wouldhave jurisdiction to  try an enemy alien in  respect of any, or at all events of the great majority, of the offences in question.  * See Stephens Criminal Law, II., pp. 17, 31 ;  also Lord Cairns&apos;s Speech in introducing the measure, Hansard (1878), 237, p.  1601.  f See Oppenheim, I, p. 260, referring to Perels, pp. 69-77.

    21. There remains  the question of Military jurisdiction,  i.e.,  the jurisdiction  exorcised by Military Courts in virtue of their  Statutory  powers,  such  as  the  Army Annual Act, or that juris-  diction which all  armies in  the  field and in occupied territory  assume in  virtue of what the &quot; American Instructions &quot;  call &quot; the  Common Law of War,&quot; or, to quote the  title of The Hague Con-  vention IT.,  &quot;The Laws and Usages of War.&quot;                       MILITARY  LAW.    22.  As regards military law as exercised under Statutory powers,  the Army  Act is confined in  its ex-territorial operation to mem-  bers of the British armed forces and army followers.   In  this  respect it  differs from  the  Code de  Justice Militaire and  the  Militar-Straf  Gesctzbuch, which make  statutory provision for  punishing  foreigners who commit offences against the national  armies on foreign soil.  The German Military Code, for  example,  Article .161, makes it an offence for any foreigner on foreign terri-  tory to commit against German troops or any German authority  an act which, if committed in  German territory, would be punish -  able by the laws of the German Empire,  and  in particular it  applies to  such cases  the German statutory  definition  of  &quot; war  treason.&quot;   These  provisions,  however,  are not  primarily con-  cerned with breaches of- the laws of war by enemy troops; they  are mainly concerned with the inhabitants of occupied territory,  and they only refer to members of the enemy forces in the case  of espionage.   Sections 63 and  64 of the French Military Code  give the Trench Military  Courts jurisdiction over foreigners, whether within or  without French  territory, if they  commit espionage,  embauohage,  and certain denned offences against  the laws of war such as pillage, arson, and despoiling the wounded.* This would certainly cover some of the chief, though not all, of the offences which we have to consider.             THE  COMMON  LAW  OF  WAR.   23. There has always been a body of laws  and usages, codified or  uncodified, known as &quot; the laws of war,&quot; imposing limitations upon the use of  violence.  These usages might not always be very clear; they were generally  far from complete; and to  some extent  they varied from country to country and according to the humanity  of individual  commanders.   Many  of  these  tempera- menta  belli originated  with commanders desirous of maintaining discipline.  The right of non-combatants to be unmolested was recognised by  generals before it was  declared  by publicists.t Articles of war prepared by  soldiers  for  soldiers, not drawn up  in  the  interests of  humanity,  but  intended to maintain  * The French law of 24th July, 1913, has given effect to Article  28 of  the geneva Convention of 1906 by modifying Articles 249 and 266 of the Code de justice Militaire by making anyone iiable (&quot; tout individu&quot; which, as Renaultobserves, covers foreigners, including  enemy troops) who despoils the wounded,&amp;c, in the &quot; Zone $operations des forces militaires.&quot;  Merighnac gives cases (cf.Eevue genii ale du droit international public, Jan., 1917, p. 35) of French militarytribunals punishing German soldiers during the present war for pillage, &amp;c,  f See Bluntschli, Das Moderne Kriegsrecht, Art. 573,
 discipline and  repress license  in  armies  in  the  field par- ticularly the articles of war  of  Maxamilian  I. and Gustavus Adolphus were  known  to  commanders,  and  were  enforced more or  less strictly.   Many manuals epitomising or explain- ing the  effect  of these articles were published.&apos;&quot;&apos;   Lord  Wood- houselee, who was  a  Judge of the  Court of Sessions in Scot- land, and who had  been Judge Advocate for that  country, and had large experience of military law, in his learned work, &quot;An Essay on  Military  Law,&quot;  refers  to the opinion of  Hale,  C.J. (Pleas of the Crown, c. 10, 15), that aliens are in  certain cases subject  to, and punishable  by, martial  (i.c, military) law, and proceeds  thus:  &quot;It is  allowed by every writer on the law  of Nature and Nations, that: although in general it is lawful in war to take all those  means of annoying an enemy which, nature and occasion  afford, yet  there are certain modes  of hostile operations which the sentiments of all polished nations have agreed to repro- bate as contrary alike to good policy and morality, and, therefore, as  evidencing  a  baseness and treachery which removes  their perpetrators  from the  condition of  ordinary enemies.  When, therefore, such persons are reduced by  the fortune of war to the state of prisoners, their conduct may justify a measure of revenge or  punishment  beyond  what  is authorised to  be  inflicted on ordinary captives.   It is not common to put to death prisoners of  war.    They  are  detained  in  safe  custody till  they are exchanged by cartel, for an equal number of our subjects  who may be in the hands of the enemy&apos;,  or till  the  conclusion of a peace restoring them to their liberty; and in the meantime they are treated with humanity.  Such is the rendition of ordinary captives.  If, however, the subjects of a foreign Power engaged with us in warfare  shall, either after a hostile  invasion of flu; country,  or clandestinely insinuating themselves into its bosom, employ themselves there in stirring up the subjects to treason or rebellion against  the Sovereign or Government of the country,  it is evident that such  persons, when  made prisoners, ought not to be considered as ordinary captives of war.  There is  no principleof justice that can condemn the forfeiture of  the lives of jiich base and treacherous enemies; but as the human and liberal spiritof our constitution does not allow the taking away of life without a judicial sentence,  so it is customary to subject such persons,though aliens (and as such in general not amenable to our laws),to trial by court  martial; when the facts being sxibstantiated byproof, that sentence is awarded which  is justly due to the atrocityof the crime.&quot;t  These  laws and usages  were at first&quot;  confined to  particular countries  or  armies.   But in course  of  time,  and  no  doubt,owing, in some degree,  to  the  influence of Grotius  and otherwriters,  they  became generally known and accepted  among rivi-lised States, though  conformity to  them was very imperfect.  Among the first attempts to codify and reduce them to writingwas  that  made by  Dr. Lieber in his  &quot; Instructions  for  the  * The bibliography of the immense literature of this  subject is collected inJcihns Geschichte cler Kriegswissenschaflen.  f Tytler&apos;s &quot; Essay on Military Law,&quot; p. 121.
Government of the  United States Armies in the Field,&quot; issued in 1863 and re-issued  in 1898.  A subsequent attempt was madein Brussels in 1874,  and in 1899 and 1907 many of these laws andusages were incorporated in The Hague Conventions.  Before  these Conventions  were  adopted,  infractions  of suchlaws and usages were punished by reprisals against the offendingbelligerent State or by the punishment of individual  offenders,if captured, of whatever rank, and whether or not a subject ofone belligerent State  or the other.  In  early times the  offenderwas often dealt with promptly and summarily.   But the  modemprocedure  has  been to bring him  before  a Military Court, whichadministers the laws and usages  of war against its own  subjectsor the  subjects of  its adversary.    For centuries  individualoffenders  against  such  laws  and usages  have  been tried andpunished by the Military Courts  of the offended  State,  whenever they have  come within its jurisdiction or power.*  24. It is true that The Hague  Conventions nowhere prescribepunishment for breaches of  the  laws of  war.    But  the well-known usages as to punishment are not  abrogated; and they  areimplied in  the  Regulations  annexed  to  Convention II. of 1899and Convention IV. of 1907.  As late as .1880 the Institute of  International Law accepted  theprinciple that  a belligerent is entitled  to punish by such lawsas he prescribes violations of the  laws of war.t             EFFECT OF THE CONCLUSION OF PEACE.  25. In applying such laws  said usages a difficulty  might arise if, before or after trial, peace Avas concluded.   Instances  of trialor punishment after such conclusion are not numerous.   Whenhostilities are ended there has usually been a general feeling to let bygones be  bygones.  This feeling has often found expressionin a general amnesty  provision  inserted in  Treaties of Peace,Avhich signifies an immunity  or exemption from prosecution  of,or other interference with,  the members of the armed forces  ofbelligerents or their respective subjects for acts committed  bythem  during the war.  But there is no  reason Avhy an amnestyclause should not contain an exception as to the trial and punish-ment  after  the conclusion of peace of  the subjects  of onebelligerent by the other belligerent for  acts contrary to the laAvsand customs of Avar.  * See the Black Book of the Admiralty (1,282).

   2G. An example of such an amnesty clause is contained in the terms of Peace  offered by  Sir Evelyn  Wood and  accepted  by the Boers after Majuba, and  ratified  by  the British  Government on March  22nd,  1881.*  Art.  1 provided &quot; Complete  amnesty to all, including the leaders, except to persons who had committed acts contrary to the rules of civilised warfare.&quot;  The representa- tiyes of the Boers  also agreed in the terms of peace  to  &quot; gladly co-operate with Her Majesty&apos;s Government in bringing to justice those who  had committed or were directly responsible  for acts contrary to the rules of civilised warfare.&quot;&apos; By Art. 5 of the Convention of Pretoria, of  3rd  August,  1881, it was provided  that &quot; All  sentences passed  upon persons who may  be convicted  of  offences contrary  to the rules  of  civilized warfare, committed  during  the recent  hostilities will  be duly carried out, and no alteration or mitigation of such sentences will be  made or  allowed by  the Government of the  Transvaal  State without Her Majesty&apos;s  consent,  conveyed through  the British Resident.&quot;  A number  of persons accused of breaches of the laws of war were under  this  Convention  brought to trial  before the  High Court of the Transvaal and the Orange Free State.t  27.  A  more  recent  example  of  an exception in an   amnesty clause is to be found in  the Treaty of Peace of Vereeniging, May  31st, 1902.  It provided that all burghers who  surrendered and accepted the position of British subjects, would be protected in their person and property and that &quot;  no proceedings, civil  or criminal,&quot; would  be taken against  them &quot; for any acts in con- nection  with the  prosecution of the Avar &quot; (Art. IV.).    The benefit,  hoAvever, of this clause was not to  extend to  certain acts contrary to the usages of  Avar  which had been notified by the Commander-in-Chief to the Boer Generals.   These offences Avere  * The British Government had on Feb. 8th directed General Colley to informPresided Brand  that H.M. Government would give all reasonable guaranteesnot to treat the Boers as rebels.  f Among such cases Avere ; that of Captain Elliot, reported to have been shot byan escort of Boers, Avhile attempting to cross the Vaal river ;  The case of William Finlay, who it was reported, having  Avith others beentried and found  guilty at Potchefstroom by a Court-Martial on a charge of violence against  the  South  African Republic, was sentenced to a term of imprisonment  with hard labour, and was sent with others under the term of imprisonment to work in the trenches exposed to the fire of the British garrison at Potchefstroom, and while so working was killed by a shell;  The case of  Andrew Malcolm,  reported  to have been beaten or kicked to death by Boers in a store between Pretoria and Potchefstroom ;  Some  of those accused of having  committed acts contrary to the rules ofcivilized warfare  were  brought to  trial,  whilst others, as to whom  there wassuspicion or evidence, were not charged as it was found under the circumstancesundesirable tolnsist on prosecution.  Two of those accused of the murder of Captain Elliot  were tried before theHigh Court of the Transvaal at Pretoria, and two of those accused of the murder of Mr. Barber were tried before the High Court of the Orange Free State.  In the case of Andrew Malcolm, the accused was brought to trial before theHigh Court at Pretoria upon a charge of ordinary murder.  In all of these cases the  accused were acquitted by the Jury.* Parl. Papers, 1882 [C. 3114], pp. 23-26.
to be tried by Court-Martial immediately after the close of hostilities-ties.   Under this  clause a  Boer officer was tried by a MilitaryCourt at Heidelberg on June 10th, 1902, for an abuse of the whiteflag and was condemned to death.*   It  is  to be observed that in  this  Treaty  the usual  reciprocalconcessions of amnesty and exemption are  absent.   The special provisions stated above were  rather in the  nature of terms dic-tated  to a defeated  enemy  than of  mutual concessions  between states treating on an equal  footing.   In this respect the analogybetween the position  of the Boers  and  that  of  the Germans isclose.   28.  Another precedent is  furnished during the American civil war,   A German, named Henry AVirtz,  who held a commissionin &apos;the Confederate Government, was in charge of the prison atAndersonville.   In violation of the  laws of war, he  caused manyof the prisoners  there detained  to be killed.   After the Declara-tion of  Peace he was  arrested and tried  on  charges stated belowbefore  a  military commission at Washington on  August 23rd,1805.t   He  was defended by counsel, found  guilty, condemnedto death and executed.   29.  In referring to these examples from South  Africa,  we havenot overlooked the fact  that these agreements were  made by  the  * Wyman&apos;s Army Debates, 1902, Yol. 2, p  1051.  f Wirtz was charged with :-      (1)  &quot; Maliciously, wilfully  and  traitorously, and in  aid of the existing    armed rebellion against the United States of America on or before  the 1st    day of March, A.D. 1864, and on divers  other occasions between that  day    and the 10th day  of April, 1865, combining, confederating and conspiring,    together with John H. Winder, Richard B. Winder,  Joseph  (Isiah  H.)   . White, W. S. Winder,  R. R. Stevenson and others unknown, to injure the    health  and  destroy  the  lives of soldiers in the Military  Service  of  the    United States, then held and being prisoners of War within the lines oi&apos; the    so-called Confederate States, and in the Military prisons thereof, to the end    that the Armies of the United States might be  weakened and impaired, in    violation of the laws and customs of war.&quot;      The  following  were counts  or &quot; specifications&quot; in  the above rharges,    viz.: &quot; unhealthy and unwholesome quarters-neglect to furnish tents,    barracks or other shelter  taking from prisoners clothing, blankets, camp    equipage and other  property unwholesome food-unwholesome water     establishing a &apos; dead line&apos; and instructing the prison guard to shoot any who    crossed the &apos; dead line,&apos; &amp;c.&quot;      (2)  &quot; Murder in violation of the laws and customs of war &quot; ; the  specifically -              cations including             &quot; Shooting a man with a pistol.&quot;            &quot; Kicking a prisoner  so that he died.&quot;            &quot; Shooting a prisoner with a pistol.&quot;            &quot; Putting a prisoner in the suocks and causing death.&quot;      Upon the first charge Wirtz was found guilty in that he combined, etc.    &quot;in violation of the  laws of war, to  impair and  injure the health and to   destroy the lives by subjecting to torture and great suffering ; by confining   in unhealthy and unwholesome quarters ; by exposing to the inclemency of    the winter  anl  to the  dews and burning sun of summer;  by  compelling&quot;   the use of impure water and  by furnishing insufficient and unwholesome   food, of large  numbers of  Federal troops,  to wit, the  number of about   45,000 soldiers  .  .   .  held  as prisoners of war at Andersonville.&quot;      Upon the second charge Wirtz AS as found guilty of  the murder  of    prisoners of war  upon the counts above mentioned and in  addition of   causing the deaths of three prisoners &quot; by means of dogs.&quot;  &quot; The War of the  Rebellion,&quot; compiled under the direction of the  Secretaryof War.   Series II.,  vol. viii.  Washington, 1899.
 British Government  with persons whom it claimed  to  be its subjects or  under its suzerainty.    In Wirtz&apos;s case, it may be observed,  that the  accused  was in law a  subject of the United States, though at the time of the acts committed he was in the service of the Confederate Government,  then recognised  as  a belligerent. *   Wirtz was exempted under the Sixth Exception  to the Presi- president&apos;s  Proclamation of Amnesty of 29th May, .1808, viz.:          &quot; All who have engaged in any way in treating,  otherwise     than  lawfully  as prisoners  of  war,  persons found in the     United  States service as officers, soldiers, seamen or in other     capacities.&quot;   80&apos;.  The Committee are of opinion that  it  would be in accord- ance with  the principles of the laws and usages of war, as hitherto understood among civilised people to bring to trial,  while a state of war  exists, persons  of whatever rank, captured or surrendered, charged on credible evidence with committing breaches of such laws and usages.   In  order to maintain clearly such jurisdiction after the  conclusion of Peace it seems necessary, however,  that in the  Treaty of Peace or other  arrangement with  the State of which the offenders are subjects, there should be express  recog- nition of the jurisdiction  of the Tribunal  before which they are to be brought.   3.1. The creation of a  Special  Court after the conclusion of Peace  for the trial of  offences  committed  during war is not wholly  without precedent.  But none  of  the precedents exactly cover the  present case.   If the  persons  who ordered or  sane- tioned  breaches of the laws of Avar  by the Central  Powers and their Allies  as well as the actual perpetrators are to be brought to trial, it seems to the Committee that the Chief Allied Powers and the United States must  accept  fully and without reseiwe the  responsibility of  creating  a  tribunal  of a novel  character such as they think appropriate for  that purpose and of clothing it with adequate powers.          *                CONSTITUTION  OF  THE TRIBUNAL..  32. As  to  the Constitution of the Tribunal two courses  seem to the Committee to be open :       (1) The establishment of an International Tribunal on Avhich           all&apos; the leading Allied Powers  and the United  States           should be represented; or     (2) The creation of purely national Courts appointed by each           of the chief Allied Powers  and the United States for           the trial of offences committed against  their respec-           tive subjects.   The  advantages of  the former  course  are the  greater  moral Aveight  attaching to the opinions and acts of such a Tribunal; the fact that it would be  the  mouthpiece of the  united  voice of the Associated Governments  upon the questions  involved; that all  * The  Confederates had been recognised as belligerents by the Supreme Court (see Moore&apos;s Digest  of Intern. Law, I, 190). See Winthrop&apos;s Military Law and Precedents II., 1295-6, where he says :  &quot; The Constitution confers upon Congress the power to define and punish offences against the laws of nations,&quot;in virtue  of which military  commissions were set up.  Cf. pp. 1304-5.
the offenders  would be dealt with  by an  International body;that such  a Tribunal would afford  security  against  decisionsof different character or  punishments  of  varying  degrees  ofseverity  being inflicted  for  similar  acts;  that  duplication  oftrials of the persons guilty of outrages against  the  subjects ofdifferent nationalities might be avoided; and that such a tribunal would  be better suited than a National Tribunal  for the trial of high officials,  naval or military, responsible for the employmentof methods of warfare by which all Allied Powers were affected.  Against this course it is urged that in order  to constitute sucha  Tribunal difficult negotiations  would  necessarily  take placeinvolving delay and possibly differences of  opinion between theStates  concerned.  The  decisions as to what States  should be represented andto what extent on  the  Tribunal, and what should be the manner of procedure would also  give rise  to  differences of opinion.  33.  It is obviously impossible that such a Tribunal could trya large number of individual cases.  Sections or  divisions wouldhave to  be  constituted, and  delay and difficulty would arise asto the  constitution, procedure and  scope of each of such sections.I]) the meantime offenders might disappear, some of the evidencemight  possibly he no longer forthcoming; and questions, which ought  to be settled and disposed of promptly, might be kept open for a long period.  The  moral effect of any decisions given andpunishments inflicted would be less after a lapse  of time.   The Committee;,  after  weighing these arguments, have  by amajority come to the conclusion that (he preferable course wouldbe the establishment of au International Tribunal constituted inthe manner suggested  in  their recommendations.   34.  The  Committee have considered  the  question  whether there should be on the Tribunal representatives of neutral States.The Committee recognise the  advantages attaching  to the pre-sence of such representatives; they would lend, it might be said,to the Tribunal a more distinct International  character.  Thereare, however,  as it seems to us, decisive objections to their  ad-mission.  The Committee cannot ignore for  instance the fact thatin  all  probability,  having  regard  to  ethnical, economic  and geographical factors, the representatives of certain  of the neutralStates might  not he free from pressure  or apprehension  of pres-sure.  In the  course of  the  war,  it may be added, those states which  most distinctly represented  neutral interests,  or which took steps to assert the rights of neutrals, became belligerents.           THE LAW TO BE APPLIED BY THE  TRIBUNAL.   35.  The Law to be applied  by  the Tribunal should be basedupon  &quot; the principles of the law of nations as they  result fromthe usages established among civilized peoples, from the laws of humanity and the dictates of the public conscience,&quot; to use  thewords contained in the preamble to Convention IV. of The hague conference, 1907.   These laws and  customs are contained in such ancient collec-tions  as the  Consolato del Mare, in  Treaties, Conventions and Declarations;  the  decisions  of Prize  Courts  and  of naval and
military courts-martial, and  of  civil courts;  naval codes and regulations;  military manuals  and  rules  for  land  warfare;Statutes,  Orders in Council,  Decrees and  Ordinances  and  un-written usages.  36. Some*of these laws and usages  havo been embodied in  the conventions of The Hague Conferences and Declarations of 1899and 1907.  At these Conferences it was found impossible to frameregulations covering all the questions arising in  the  conduct ofwar, and  no attempt to produce an exhaustive  code of rules wasmade.     The  contracting  parties expressly stated  in  Conven-tion II., 1899, that it was not intended &quot; that cases not  providedfor should, for want of a written provision, be left to the arbitraryjudgment of military commanders.&quot;  87. It has been contended by the German Government  since  thecommencement of the war that the Conventions of The hague conference, .1907, could not be applied to the conduct of hostilities-ties, since all  the belligerents  had  not  ratified  them.   this contention would appear  to  be well-founded.    The laws  and customs of land warfare are dealt with in Convention II. of 1899and in Convention IV. of  .1907.  38. By  Art. .1 of Convention  II., 1899, and Convention IV.,1907, the  contracting  Powers agreed to issue instructions to theirarmed  forces in the field framed in conformity  with the Regula-tions respecting the laws and customs of war on land  annexed tothe respective Conventions.  By Art.  2 of Convention IV., .1907,it was agreed that the provisions contained in these Regulations,as well  as those contained  in Convention  IV.,  .1907,  should notapply except between the contracting Powers,  and then only if all  the belligerents were parlies to the  Convention.  39. By  Art.  4 of Convention IV., 1907,  it  was agreed thatConvention IV., when ratified, should, as between the  contract-ing Powers, be substituted for the Convention II.,  1899.  It was further agreed that the Conventions of 1899  should remain &quot;inforce as between the Powers which signed it&apos;&apos; and  which did not also ratify Convention IV., 1907.  Bulgaria, Greece, Italy, Montenegro  and Serbia signed hutdid not ratify Convention  IV.,  .1907.  The Committee are of opinion that the Convention of 1899 is applicable, since to this Convention all the belligerent States wereparties.   All signed and ratified, or subsequently  adhered to it.By  Art. 2 of Convention II.,  1899, it was agreed that  the pro-visions contained in the Regulations were only  to be binding&apos; onthe contracting Powers in  case of war between two or  more ofthem, and it was further agreed  that  these provisions^should cease to be binding  when in a war between contracting Powers anon-contracting Power joined one of  the belligerents.  All the belligerents having signed the Convention or subsequently adhered to it,  and no non-contracting Power  having joined any of  the belligerents, this Convention  would appear to apply to  the con-duct of the war.  By Art. 25 of Convention X.,  .1907, it was  agreed that Comvention  III.,  .1899, relating to the  Geneva Convention, 1864,should  remain in force as  between the Powers which signed it
  * Declaration IV., 2,  of 1899, whereby the  contracting Powers agreed to abstain from the use of projectiles the sole object of which is the diffusion ofasphyxiating or deleterious gases, Avas declared only binding on the contractingPoAvers in the  case of  a Avar  between two or more of them.  It was furtherdeclared that the Declaration should cease to bo binding from the time when, ina war between the contracting Powers, one of the belligerents should be joined by a non-contracting Power.  Brazil, Cuba and  the United States, did notratify or adhere to the Declaration.  Consequently upon the entry of Brazil andCuba into the Avar as allies of the United States, the Declaration ceased to apply.  f In the opinion of  the Committee, the statement to the contrary effect in chapter XIV., para. 443 of the Manual of Military Law lacks authority.but which did not also ratify Convention X., 1907.   ConsequentlyConvention III.. 1899,  also would appear to be applicable in thepresent war.*   40.  It  cannot be too,strongly urged  that, whether these Con-ventions and Declarations have been ratified or not,  they are to avery large extent merely declaratory of existing laws and usages.                       SUPERIOR  ORDERS.   4.1.  The Committee have devoted considerable attention to thequestion  whether an accused  person can  plead  superior orderseither in  bar of his  trial or as  a mitigation of his  offence.  Theyare of opinion  that  no  person should be punished  for  the corn-mission of an act which  he did not know to be forbidden  or whichhe could  not reasonably  be expected to know  to be unlawful.They  recognise  the  fact  that  military  discipline requires that members of the armed forces of a State should obey the commandsof their superiors,  and  that such discipline  also requires thatthose who execute such  commands should do so with a knowledge that they  will be immune from punishment for so  doing.  TheCommittee cannot,  however, accept the doctrine that  it is theduly of a sailor or  soldier never to question an order which  he receives.f  They consider that, if the act constituting the offencecharged was-done in obedience  to  the order of a superior, thisshould be treated as primd facie  a  defence, but that  such defencemight be  displaced by proof:      (a) That the order  did not relate to a military duty.    (b) That the act charged  Avas  in excess of  and  not covered           by the order given.    (c) That  the  act  charged  AVUS flagrantly   and obviously           contrary  to  the  laws  and customs  of  Avar  and  of           humanity.    (d) That there  were circumstances  from which knowledge           of the illegality  of  the  order could be  imputed to the           accused.    (c) That it Avas an order in regard to the execution of Avhich           the  accused had a discretion.   If the plea of superior orders does not succeed as a  defence,it  may still  be relevant as  a  circumstance to be considered  inmitigation of punishment.
                          PROCEDURE.   42.  There are at present, broadly slaied, two types of Criminal Procedure, the Anglo-American aad the French; the former based upon  the  accusatory  principle,  the  latter originally upon the inquisitorial.   It is  suggested  that neither should be strictly adhered to.   The procedure ought to be  as simple as possible. The proceedings should be public and mainly oral, and witnesses should be liable  to examination and cross-examination.   The accused should be entitled to the assistance of counsel.   The Committee  have not deemed it necessary or proper to frame a complete code of rules of procedure, but have merely suggested certain principles, the observance of which  would fully ensure justice to the accused.   43.  No suggestion is made as to any appeal or  revision of the judgment  or sentence.  Nor does such  seem necessary, having regard to the size of the Tribunal and the nature of the procedure above  described, with  its safeguards for fair play.  But it might be  advisable to stipulate  that  the Full Court might, in its dis- crotion, re-consider or  revise any of the sentences of a Division of the Court.                          EVIDENCE.  44.  Having considered  the advantages or disadvantages of the rules of evidence, as understood by English  and by French Courts, we have come to  the  conclusion that the  matter  should he left to the discretion of the Tribunal.                  THE EX-KAISER&apos;S POSITION.  45.  In  regard to the proceedings against  the  ex-Kaiser, the Committee are of opinion  that little aid can be derived from pre- cedents.  The case is unique;  and it behoves the States chiefly  concerned to act  in accordance  with what seems to  them in the circum- stances just and proper, having in view the effect  of their action on  international law  and  the  future conduct of  war.    While there is no exact precedent for pxrnishment, there is also no exact precedent in modern times for a series of  crimes  brought about by  a group of men of whom the ex-Kaiser was one.  To suffer him (if responsible for grave offences against the laws and usages of war) to go free  and unpunished, while minor offenders acting under  his orders, or with  his sanction, were tried  and  punished, would  be inequitable.  He would be more  favourably dealt  with than others much less blameable.  46. Assuming that he is to be dealt with, two  courses might be taken he  might  be  treated  summarily  and   administratively without any trial, in  much the  same manner as  Napoleon was dealt with in 1815,, or  he  might be tried before  a  Tribunal  such as has&apos; been suggested  above.   One of several objections to the former mode of treatment is that it would  slur over notable dif- ferences between the two cases.  Napoleon  was not charged withhaving during the Hundred Days  carried on war contrary tothe usages of civilised  nations.   His offence, if  any, was either
that he was a rebel to the lawful  French Government or thathe had violated the arrangement agreed to by him in 1814.* the moral  effect  of  confinement  or internment  of  the  ex-Kaiserwithout a trial would&apos;be much less than proceedings in  whichhe would be heard and, if found guilty, punished accordingly.  The opinion of  the majority of the members of the  Committeeon the whole is in favour of the second course.            EX-KAISER&apos;s CONSTITUTIONAL POSITION.  47. By Art. 18 of the Constitution the Emperor shall appointImperial officials and cause them to take the oath to  the Empireand  dismiss them when necessary.  By Art.  58 the Navy  of  the Empire shall form a unity underthe supreme command of the Emperor.   The Emperor is chargedwith  its organisation  and composition;  he  shall appoint theofficers  and officials of the  navy; and they  and the seamenshall take an oath of obedience tchim.  By Art.  63.   The total  land  forces  of the Empire shall formone army;  it shall be under the command of the Emperor in warand  in peace.  By Art.  64.   All  German  troops are bound  to render uncon-ditional obedience to the commands of the Emperor.  This obli-gation shall be included in the military  oath.  48. In the Reports of the Sub-Committees for  Offences on land and  at Sea an account will be found of the organisation  of theGerman army and navy and the actual part which the ex-Kaisertook in  their administration.   There is evidence that he in factexercised his large constitutional powers, and was in truth &quot; WarLord.&quot;   In the  same Reports there are grounds for an opinionthat a primd facie case can  be established against him for respon-sibility for certain crimes.  The  Committee are  unable to see any reason in  principle for  excluding  responsibility^   It  is to cease with  the Generals  in  the field ?   Ought it not to extend tothose, however highly placed, who directed a system under  which such crimes were committed?   It seems impossible to distinguish between  his responsibility and  that  of other  commanders; ifany  difference exists between  them it  is not one in  his favour.If the ex-Kaiser were surrendered by the Dutch Governmentto the  Allies,   or  to any of  them,  it  seems  incontestablethat he could  be  tried by   a   court-martial  or some  modi-fication  of  it under military  law for  offences  contrary  to the laws and customs of war and  the laws of humanity,  committed by him or under his  orders or with his  complicity as  head  of thearmy.   For this proposition no  authority can be cited; but  sub-ject to the objection  to be considered later based  upon  his position  * See  Twiss&apos;s Life of Lord Eldon II, 270 ; alto Hansard (1816), Yol. 33.pp. 1012-1020, 1059-1064.  f This aspect  of the subject is more fully discussed  in  Sect. VI. of professor Morgan&apos;s Memorandum on the plea of Superior Orders.  See p. 48.
as a sovereign, no authority would seem fo be necessary, assuni-ing liis complicity in illegal acts.  If be were  surrendered after peace there seems no reason inprinciple why he  should not be tried by a Tribunal set up undera  Treaty  expressly  providing  for  the   recognition  of  itsjurisdiction.            ALLEGED  IMMUNITY OF THE EX-KAISER.  49. It  has been urged that the ex-Kaiser, being a Sovereignat the time when the offences charged against him  were com-mitted, is and was exempt from the jurisdiction of any Tribunal.This question lias  rarely been discussed in modern times.  Indeed,since the trial of  Mary  Queen of Scots, and perhaps  it may beadded, the murder by  Queen Christian of Sweden of her chamber-lain Monaldeschi  at  Eontainebleau, it has possessed  only anacademic interest.* In a note are- collected the opinions of someof the chief  text-writers who have touched the subject.!  Forthe most part they do not distinguish between the position of a sovereign who visits or resides in a foreign country at the invitation-tation or by the permission, express or implied, of its  Sovereign,and that of a Sovereign who  invades and occupies foreign terri-tory in spite of the resistance of  its Sovereign.  For immunityin the latter case  there seems to be no authority.  Ancient prac-tice  was  against it.  No  modern  usage  establishing  suchimmunity appears to exist.   In  recent times sovereigns  havebeen made prisoners of war, e.g.,  Napoleon  III. in 1870 and theElector of Hesse in 1886.X  The German Manual of Military Lawincludes  sovereigns among possible prisoners of war;  and there seems no  reason  why, if captured,  they should not  be  treatedaccording as they  have or have not violated the laws of war.

        NOTE  ON  IMMUNITY  OF  SOVEREIGNS.           By Sir JOHN MACDONELL;  K.C.B.,  LL.I).   While the subject of the immunity of sovereigns from the civil and criminal jurisdiction of foreign Courts has been much dis-cussed by writers on international law, and certain well-knownrules are generally accepted, the precise point mentioned in the&quot; Reasons&apos;&quot;* has  rarely  been  in  modern  times  considered.Most writers have either omitted  mentioning it,  or  have  usedambiguous language.    They  have,  as a  rule, confined  their attention  to  immunity of sovereigns from the jurisdiction of courts of foreign territories in which they do not reside or inwhich they are present by invitation or permission, express orimplied.  The point was discussed  at  length with reference to MaryQueen of Scots, who on her trial pleaded,  without success, herrights as a sovereign in answer to  the. charges against her.   Inthe course of the trial, Sir Christopher Hatton, one of the Com-missioners, remarked :  &quot; You say you are a queen; be it so.  Butin such  a crime the royal dignity is  not exempted from answeringneither  by  the civil nor canon law,  nor by the law of nations.&quot;!Such was the opinion of the other Commissioners.$  There is a  critical discussion  of  this plea  in Ward&apos;s enquiry into the Law of&apos;  Nations. $   While  expressing no opinion uponthe point, he remarks that &quot; it must be owned that the ministers and lawyers  of England held in the most decided terms that a sovereign  acknowledged as such and residing  freely within theterritory of another was liable to he punished for treason by theCourts of the land.&quot;II   Mr. Ward  adds: &quot;there is  at least  no case in the history of the world  by  which to support the general discussion.&quot;U  A similar point was  raised, but not  decided,  with reference tothe murder of Monalde.sehi by the Queen of Sweden while resid-ing in France.   The common opinion  on that crime is probablyexpressed  by Hallam: ** &quot;Whatever be the privilege  of in-violability  attached to sovereigns,   it must, on  every rationalground, be confined to  those who enjoy and exercise dominion insome independent territory.   An abdicated or dethroned monarchmay preserve his title by the courtesy of other States, but cannotrank with sovereigns in  the  tribunals where public law is ad-ministered.   I should  be ratlier  surprised to hear any one assertthat the Parliament of  Paris was incompetent to try Christina forthe murder of Monaldeschi.&quot;* p. 31.                     f I- State Trials,117.X See Strype&apos;s Annals of the Reformation, III., part I., p. 523.S II., p. 564.

Probably the opinions of writers on the subject may be thus classified :

(1) Those who state the ancient usage of war as to vanquished sovereigns in all its severity;

(2) those who, like Albericus Gentilis,* urge the desirability of exercising moderation and magnanimity in carrying out such usage or rights in regard to defeated Kings and generals;

(3) those who, especially about the time of Louis XIV., seek to exalt the sacrosanct character of the sovereign;

(4) those recent writers who use comprehensive language as to such immunity without having in mind the exact point mentioned in the text.

It had been the ancient practice to treat with severity lealders of defeated armies; but on the part of the theoretical writers in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries there was a desire to humanise warfare,  especially as to the treatment of prisoners. For example, Albericus Gentilis,* in a chapter entitled " de ducibus hostium captis," enumerates many examples of Kings who make war being killed or enslaved by their captors. But he pleads for the exercise of humanity towards captured Princes, " nisi caused speciales caedern probent. " Grotius knows nothing of the special immunity of Kings taken prisoners in war; indeed he cites examples of commanders being put to death. He argues for moderation in the punishment of the vanquished, and enumerates certain classes (e.g., women and children, etc.) which ought to be spared; he does not specially name sovereigns. In Zouche† mention is made of the case of Queen Mary, and he discusses the question whether a prince has sovereignty over another prince in his own territory, but he gives no answer. The same writer‡ remarks: " Et si cum in territorio principis in quern conjurarunt deprehensi sunt, præsenti vindicta uti melius videbitur; juri gentium convenit pro hostibus declarare, unde, non expectato judicio, cuivis eos interficere impune liceat."

Bynkershoek, § discussing the subject in a passage quoted by Phillimore? (II. 138n), recommends summary action in the case of a foreign sovereign causing internal troubles; but the precise point named in the text is not dealt with.

Puffendorf does not mention the complete immunity of sovereigns. Vattel? touches this question and praises the humanity of those who in war spared the person of the king. He adds, " Mais ce n&apos;est point une loi de guerre épargnes en toute recontre la personne du roi ennemi; et on n&apos;y obligé que quand on a la facilité de le faire prisohnier."

Extreme cases  may be  put whichwould  make  the rule  inapplicable.    If,  indeed,  he shouldabuse the hospitality of the kingdom,  he may be ordered, like adelinquent ambassador, to depart from it without delay.   If, heshould contrive or perpetrate any offence against the  welfare orlaws of the country in which  he is a guest,  International  Lawwould warrant the authorities of that country in preventing thecommission of  the  offence, by placing him under necessary re-straint,  and in subsequently demanding satisfaction for the injuryat the hands of the country of this delinquent representative. Wemay go a  step further,  and say that his act of violence maybe met  by violence, and that if he perish in  consequence of the resistance opposed to his  unlawful conduct, no maxim of Inter-national Law  is violated.    But may the delinquent  sovereign,under any circumstances,  be rendered amenable  to  the  criminal jurisdiction  of a foreign country?  It is difficult  in a,treatiseon law to answer a question which is founded upon the suppositionthat the representatives of the majesty of the law are the criminalsto  be tried by the law.  If, however,  the question  must receive a categorical answer, the answer must be in the negative.   -the historical precedents which might appear to countenance a con-&apos;trary opinion are valueless.  Nihil igitur in hoc  argumento pro-ficies rebus similiter a gentibus jucUcatis is the just observation ofBynkershoek.  Tt is obvious, moreover, that  this class  of  cases is happily so rare and the instances cited are so exceptional intheir nature, both  from their  own circumstances and from  the periods  of history in  which they happened,  that InternationalLaw cannot rely upon them as exponents of usage in this, arduousmatter,  but must guide the enquirer by the reason  of the thingapplied  to the exigency of each particular occurrence.   Interna-tional Law, like the Civil Law, must pass by without attempting* DROIT DES GENS MODERNE DE 1&apos;EUROPE, s. 245,f INSTITUTES OF INTERNATIONAL LAW, I., 42.:: 1,42,43.g n., P. 137.
  lo bring- under exact rales anomalies which a  sudden emergency  may create,  or in  provide beforehand  for  all imaginable  qui-  fingencies.&quot;    ft is  difficult to  understand why  LMiillimore arrives at.a  con-  clusion  adverse to such jurisdiction, if, indeed, he arrives at any  conclusion.  If exemption exists, it must be derived from express  agreement, or  implied  from  usage; and  none,  it is  admitted,  exists.    Wheaton,* one of the  latest writers who has touched the  sub-  ject, says that the foreign sovereign &quot; is not amenable to the  civil or  criminal jurisdiction of the country where he temporarily  resides.&quot;   But  he  adds   (p.  .198):  &quot;Should  one  sovereign  enter the territory of another  without the consent of their order,  expressed or implied, it woidd present a question which did not  appear to be perfectly settled.&quot;   Later writerst express themselves in  general terms  as to the immunity of the foreign sovereigns.  But they do not  deal with the point in question.  . The  true groiyid of  the well-known exemptions of  foreign sovereigns  from local jurisdiction is stated by Marshall, C.J., in   &quot;The  Exchange&quot;:   &quot;A   foreign   sovereign    is  not understood as  intending  to  subject himself  to  a  jurisdiction incompatible  with  his dignity  and the dignity  of  his  nation, and  it  is to  avoid  this subjection  that  the  licence  has been obtained.   The character to whom it is given,  and the object for&apos; which it is granted, equally required that it should be construed to impart full security to the  person who has obtained it.   This security, however, need  not be expressed; it is implied from the circumstances  of the case.    Should one sovereign enter  the territory of another without the consent of the other, expressed or implied, it Would present a  question which does not appear to be perfectly settled,  a decision of  which is  not necessary to  any conclusion  to which  the Court may come in  the cause under consideration.   If he did  not  thereby  expose himself  to  the territorial jurisdiction of  the  sovereign  whose  dominions he had entered, it would seem  to be because  all sovereigns impliedly engage  not to  avail  themselves of  a power over ,their equals which a romantic confidence  in their magnanimity  has placed in their  hands.&quot;  (137-138.)   The result of an  examination of the authorities, if  such  can be said to exist,&apos; would seem to be  that there is no rule or usage exempting  from  criminal  jurisdiction  foreign - sovereigns who have invaded the territory of another sovereign.* Ed. by Lawrence, p. 188.f E.g., Oalvo (VI., s. 2849), Brafils (s. 641), Hall (s. 48).j 7 Cranch, p. 137.20962

This  paper is  a memorandum  submitted  to the Sub-Committee on Law by Professor Morgan.         THE   PLEA   OF SUPERIOR  ORDERS.  The question of  the extent  to  which superior orders- can  bepleaded as an excuse for a breach of the law  is one  which has never received any authoritative interpretation, so far as offences against the laws and customs of war are concerned.   In Englishlaw  we  have nothing to guide us except the decisions of thecourts as  to  what  a  soldier may or may not do  in regard  to persons  who are  within  the  King&apos;s  peace for example, the degree of force  he is justified in using in order to  suppress a civildisturbance or rebellion.   Upon the kind of force he may exerciseagainst enemies and it must be remembered that in English law a rebel has never the status of an &quot; enemy &quot; there is not a singledecision.  Civil law is one thing; foreign Avar, or Avar in theinternational sense, is quite another.*  All the  tests to which thecourts subject the conduct of soldiers in  the first case are  moreor less irrelevant  when we come to the second.   &quot; Soldiers,&quot; wehave been told  by Lord Bowen  in his Report on the Featherstoneriots, are  &quot;  only civilians  armed in a particular manner &quot;; butto apply this description  to soldiers in the field would be no lessfalse than ludicrous.  The soldier avIio, when made a prisoner ofAvar, pleaded that he was only a civilian armed  in  a particularmanner would  get short shrift from the enemy forces.   the degree of  obedience required of the  soldier in the first case is always limited by his duty to avoid a  breach of the common law;no such duty exists in the second case, for the  common law doesnot run in the field least of all in regard to the King&apos;s enemies.The  legislature has recognised the distinction to the extent  ofinsisting&apos; on  the more imperative character of a command givenin time of war by distinguishing between the  penalties whichattach to  disobedience to a command in time of peace and on active service,  Mere disobedience to a &quot; lawful  command &quot;t ispunishable when  on active service^ with penal servitude; when * Un&apos;ess otherwise indicated I have used the term &quot; war &quot; throughout in its internationalsonar,/.(.&apos;., a war with a foreign country.&apos; t Army Act, sec.9 (2). % Army Act, hoc. 18!) 11) defines active service as equivalent to service against the enemy,inclnd ng military occupation of a foreign country.  In other words it refers to war inthe international sonse.
 not on active service with imprisonment.  As to the meaning- of the word &quot;lawful &quot; I will  say  something in a moment, merely remarking  here that,  while it  obviously includes  a  command which is lawful at common  law during a state  of affairs falling- short of war, it is not obvious that the command is to be subject to the same test of lawfulness when war is declared.                              I.                         ENGLISH  LAAV.   NOAV, it  is a commonplace of English writers that in time of peace a soldier AVIIO obeys  a command,  the execution of Avhich results in a breach of the law, is as liable to ansAver for his acts as  a civilian  acting under the persuasion of  another.*  This is approximately  true, but it must be remembered that to establish guilt it is always necessary  to prove the  existence of that guilty mind known to lawyers as men-s rea, and the  catena of acts and intents necessary to establish it would rarely co-exist in the same Avay in the  case of a civilian and a soldier.   The military duty of a soldier to obey orders implicitly would probably be taken into account in a court of common law in the case of  a soldier obeying them. . It would appear that  unless the orders were manifestly illegal,  the presumption of absence  of guilty mind will  be stronger in his case than in that of a  civilian.   There  is autho- rity for this.t   Too much has been made of the  poignancy of the&apos;Soldier&apos;s dilemma in being subject to two conflicting jurisdictions, and the epigram which attempts to sharpen that dilemma in the words &quot;he is liable to be hanged if he obeys an order  and shot if he does not obey it&quot;  is,  like most epigrams, inaccurate.   A soldier AVIIO refused to fire on a croAvd of innocent spectators in time of peace  or ciAal disturbance Avould  not, unless his discussed- obedience amounted to &quot; wilful defiance &quot; of military authority, be even nominally liable to be shot;  the highest  military penalty he  would incur would  be imprisonment.   Thus the degree of duress under which a  soldier acts in obeying an order in time of peace or  civil  disturbance is appreciably less  coercive than  that AAdiich is exercised upon him in time of Avar, there being, as will be seen in a moment, no limits in the latter case.   He is therefore in a. position to exercise a far greater degree of  discretion in dis- criminating as  to the lawfulness of orders  in time of peace  or civil  strife.  Epigrams  will  not  help us  to resolve the question, and if the soldier has his dilemmas, so has  the  civil  magistrate. The Mayor  of Bristol, whose infirmity of will  is notorious in our law reports, may have reflected that if he  had ordered the soldiers to fire on the crowd he might be hanged, and that if he did not give the  order  he might, as indeed he  was,  be indicted for a misdemeanour.  * I have discussed this question more fully in an article under the title of &quot; The Armyand the Civil Power&quot; which appeared in The Nineteenth Century for May, 1914, and in&quot; War, its Conduct and Legal Results,&quot;              &apos;    V  t Cf., R. V- Smith (for which see below): &quot; That he is responsible whenever he obeys anorder is a view which the Court cannot accept,&quot;
  Let us now turn to a time of war.   The only case, to my know-ledge, which deals with, the criminal responsibility of a soldierobeying orders in time of war is It. v. Smith * and in that casethe court refused to countenance the  extreme view that a soldierwas  bound to obey,  and was therefore legally protected in  obey-ing every order, however unlawful.  That  case is, however, not one to conjure with  and is somewhat irrelevant to the  issue, as itdealt with the act of a soldier in shooting, under the orders of hisofficer,  a native in a district in which martial law had been pro-claimed during the South African war and the native was not an  enemy he  was  within  the  King&apos;s  peace.   The court was,&apos;moreover, a special court sitting under a special Act.   The words of the court  have, however,  value as an  obiter dictum ; and they made the admission that the imperiousness of the soklier&apos;s dutyof obedience  was far greater,  and consequently his  immunitymore extended, in time of  war  than in time of peace.   &quot;one must remember,&quot; the court urged, &quot;that  especially in time  ofwar  immediate obedience  to order  is  required for  a  privatesoldier,&quot;  and they  clearly  held  that in time of  war a soldier-is  entitled  to  a  stronger  presumption of  the lawfulness  ofthe order under which he acts.   There  is another considerationupon which the court was silent,  and  that is the degree of duressunder which a soldier acts in time of war.   It must not be for-gotten that in the field  an officer can shoot  a soldier on the  spotii the latter disobeys an  order to  advance, and no  law has ever setlimits to what he may do during hostilities if his orders are dis-obeyed.  Hale (I., &quot; Pleas  of the Crown,&quot; VIII., p. 49) recog-nised the difference when he wrote: &quot; In time of  peace the threat of death will not excuse a man (i.e., a man who commits a felonyunder compulsion)  because  the  law  is  theie  to protect him,&quot;whereas &quot;there is to be observed a difference betAveen the times of Avar  or public insurrection and rebellion and  times of peace,because in the former a person is under so great  a power that he cannot  resist or avoid.&quot;   Foster (&quot; Crown  Cases,&quot; p, 13) makes the same distinction in the case  of treason;  if there is a continu-ing force and fear,  amounting  to actual and instant apprehen-sion  of  death, a man Avho joins rebels or enemies is excused.  Ifthis  be true  of acts done, against the King&apos;s peace and against persons Avithin the King&apos;s peace, Avhich is what Hale and Fosterhave in mind, it is still more true of acts done against &quot; enemies &quot;Avho  are not  within  the King&apos;s  peace.   As  I have attempted  toshow in dealing with the question of jurisdiction, it is extremely doubtful if the latter class of acts, whether done in the executionof orders or not, are justiciable at common  law at all.  It is one thing for a court to sit and  determine whether the country is sodisturbed as  to be domestically  in &quot;a state  of  Avar,&quot; Avhich  is always  a  question of fact of which it may require proof; it  isquite another for a court to enter on a discussion whether the  * 17 Cape Reports (1000) 5G1.  South African cases must be handled with very greatcaution for it was often difficult to distinguish botAveen rebels unit belligerents anddiffei ont considerations $rose according as the military were dealing with disturood districtswithin British territory which had bi en proclaimed and enemy territory Avhich was quitebutsido tho King&apos;s peace. .&quot; Cf.

 country  is at war with some other country, which is not a ques- tion of fact at all, hut one upon which the declaration  of  the Sovereign  is  final  and  entitled to  &quot;judicial  notice.&quot;   In  the former case the court can determine both the fact of war and  the necessity,  and therefore  the  degree  of  justification,  of  the measures taken to meet it;  in the second case it can. do neither. Stephen, with very good reason, doubts whether a British officer who,  in  time of  war and  on  an  invasion of  England  by  the enemy, put enemy prisoners to  death in cold blood could be tried at common law  at all;  is  it any more probable -that  a  British soldier who executed the order  would be liable?   And it is quite certain that  neither the one nor the  other would be liable if  the acts were  committed outside British territory.   American law, the standpoint of which is  the same as our law, is clearly con- consious  of the  distinction^   The  English courts have indeed in one case laid down in unequi- vocal language that it is the duty of soldiers and officers to  render unquestioning obedience in time of war.  They did  so in the case of Sutton  v.  Jolmstone (1  East 548).t  The  court laid  clown that-        &quot;  A subordinate must not, even to save the lives of others     or his own life, judge  of the danger, propriety, expediency,     or consequence of  the order he  receives;  he must  obey.     Nothing  but  a physical impossibility can excuse him. The     first, second,  and third part of a  soldier  is obedience.&quot; But this  case was a case of an order  to engage the enemy,  which is always a  &quot;lawful command,&quot; however  unreasonable  it may happen under the circumstances to be, and not of an order to do something  unlawful.   Obedience in  such a  case would not have involved  the commission of an offence at common law or. under International law.  But even so,  Lord Mansfield&apos;s  dictum goes far  beyond the military view itself.   It is  not true that it is a soldier&apos;s  duty even supposing, a-s Lord Mansfield   does, that a soldier&apos;s  duty and an officers military duty are the same never to question the danger, propriety,  expediency,  or consequence of the order he receives.  I know of a case during the present war in which a British subaltern ordered his men to cease firing, and put up the  white  flag, whereupon his platoon sergeant  tore it downand disregarded the order; it was the officer who was  subsequentlycourt-martialled  and  not the man.   Indeed,  the Field Service  * For example, while laying down that &quot; military officers can no more protect themselvesthan civilians for actual wrongs committed in time of peaoe under orders &quot; it qualifies this with the preamble &quot; whatever may be the rule in time of war and in the presence of actualhostilities.&quot;. Military Laws of the United States, footnote to Article 21 of tho Articles ofWar, p. 973.  Whatever may be tho case as to criminal proceedings, it sterns clear that nocivil action would lie in case of irar.  Cf. Winthrop II. 1388, &quot; For an act done jure belli,or for the exercise of a belligerent right, an officer or soldier cannot be called to account in a civil proceeding.&quot;  f This, however, it should bo remarked was a case of tort and there arc several things to notice about it before we accept it as au authority one way or the other. In the first place,being an action in tort, it is no authority on tho subject of criminal responsibility.  In thesecond place, tho courts in entertaining jurisdiction wero n&apos;t dealing with an act done intime of  war but with the question whether a prose &apos;ution subsequently instituted in time ofpeace before a court-martial by one officer against another for disobedience to an ordergiven in war was malicious and without reasonable and probable cause ; the caso is there-fore no exception to the rule laid down in Barwis v. Keppel that the courts will not interfere in regard to acts done in tho conduct of hostilities. In the third place it did not deal withacts done against the enemy.20962
 Regulation^&apos; lay down that if  in  the face  of  unexpected local circumstances a subordinate neglects to depart from the letter of his orders,  when such departure is  clearly demanded by cireum- stances, and failure ensues, he will be held  responsible for such failure.  In such cases he is required  to disobey the lawful, order because obedience to  it turns out to be unreasonable,                              II.                        MILITARY LAW.   What then is the meaning of the  words  &quot; lawful command &quot; in the Army Act when the order is  given on active service.  I doubt if the word can be interpreted to mean lawful at Common Law. Primarily it means, as the official comment interprets it to mean, a  command which an officer is competent, from a military point of view, to  give, according to the usages  of  the service or other- wise.   If a body of British soldiers shot  down German civilians in cold blood under the orders of an officer,  the officer would be put on his trial before a court-martial,  but it does not follow that the men  would be.  The  fact is the  Army  Act is silent  on  the question as to the liability of soldiers to be punished for obeying unlawful commands, and it is almost equally  silent on the penalty attaching to soldiers  or officers who commit breaches of the laws,&apos;of war, with the exception of &quot; offences against the property or person of an inhabitant in the country in which they are serv ing&quot;, an expression  which is not usually interpreted to include an enemy combatant.  Such offences  would either be punished under Section 6 (/) just quoted, or under Section 40 dealing with acts to the prejudice of good order and military discipline.   They might also be punished under Martial  Law.  But all this  throws but  little light on the extent to which a soldier is justified in disobeying such commands.   The only case within my knowledge in which the issue was raised in the  British  Army during  the present war concerned a &quot; war crime,&quot; i.e., a crime by the  enemy against British troops,  a case where  a German soldier was charged before  a  British  military court (not  a &quot; court-martial &quot;) with treacherously opening fire after surrender.    He pleaded  that he was acting under the orders of a  German officer, and the Com- mander-in-Chief,  Lord French, refused to confirm the conviction and sentence, on  the ground that there was evidence to support his plea.   The  whole question must,  I  think,  be considered under  two tests:  (.1) the  consequences of disobedience; (2) the  scope of military &quot;duty.    As regards the first,  our own military  law in practice,  the French  and German  military law in  both  theory and  practice,  punish  with  greater or less severity  acts  of  dis- obedience according as they were or were not cpmmitted &quot;  in face of the  enemy, &quot;t  and this is an argument for allowing a  greater  * FieM Service Regulations Part I., Sec. 13, p. 31.  t The Army Act does not make the distinction theoretically-it merelv distinguishes &quot; active service,&quot; Le., between war and peace, but the German Military Code  (Sec. 95) further distinguishes disobedienco in the field &quot; im Fdde&quot; i.e.,  in time of war, according as it  does or does not take place &quot;before the enemy&quot; (vor dem Feinde)i  In the French Military Code (Sec. 218) there is tho same distinction between disobedience &quot; en presence, de 1&apos;ennemi &quot;and disobedience &quot;sur im torritoire.  en etat de guerre.&quot;
  * This point of view may be illustrated by Sec. 250 of the French Military Code whichlays down that where  a number of soldiers (des militaires en bande) commit pillage, the death penalty shall only be inflicted on the ringleaders (instigateurs) and those whose rankis superior to that of  the others (les plus eleves on grade).  Compare also Winthrop&apos;military Law and Precedents II., p. 883 &quot; a certain discretion in the execution of an order may sometimes be permitted to&apos; officers high in rank ior command.&quot;  degree of immunity to the soldier who obeys commands contrary  to the laws of war in the field, e.g., refuses quarter, than to the  soldier who obeys similar commands in  occupied territory or  when  in charge of a prison camp.  Also one must,  I think, dis-  distinguish between the case of. a soldier who obeys the command of  an officer and an officer who  obeys the  command  of a superior  officer.  The latter has more discretion, he is usually given more  opportunities of deliberation,  and he has more knowledge.*  A  soldier is not supposed  to familiarise himself with the contents  of the Field Service Kegulations, nor does he receive any educa-  tion in military law; the contrary is the  case with an officer; the  Hague Regulations have been incorporated in the British Manual  of Military Law and to some extent in our  Field Service Regula-  tions and they have been incorporated in the Feld-dienstordnung  by way of  Appendix in  1908.    One may  therefore  impute  a  knowledge of the Laws of War  to an officer which one  cannot  impute to a soldier.   A soldier, in such cases, is very often in the  position imagined by  old writers like Coke, Hale and  Hawkins,  the position of a hangman carrying out an invalid sentence, in  which  case  they held that, if the sentence had all reasonable  appearance  of validity,  the  man&apos;s public  official subjection  afforded him  immunity.  Be&apos;that, as it may, it cannot  be too  cleaxdy asserted  that  English  military  law  gives little  coun-  tenance to the view that a soldier,  much*less an  officer,  must,  under  all circumstances in time of war,  yield an unquestioning  obedience to the commands imposed  upon him.  Where such an one disobeyed an order  which admitted  of any doubt  as  to its  propriety he  would be  tried  either  solely,  or  at  least  in the alternative,  under the section which deals with  conduct to the prejudice of good  order  and  military discipline,   rather  than under  the section  which deals with the  far greater offence, attended by far more intimidating penalties, of disobedience.  I know of a case in the present war in which an officer was ordered to  take charge of a firing  party for the  execution of a  deserter, and,  after being duly warned by  his CO., refusied to carry out the order on the ground that for certain personal peculiar reasons it was repugnant to his feelings.   He was not, though he  might have been, tried for disobeying a lawful command, wilfully or otherwise; he was tried for the lesser offence  of conduct  to the prejudice, and his only  punishment was a reprimand.    There were present, however, circumstances which made the command an  unreasonable one.  As to the second test, the scope of military duty, here we are on  sure grounjd, and,  as will  be seen in a  moment, even the formidable  immunities  which  a  German  soldier  could  claim under German military law are not impenetrable.   As the official comment on the Army Act points out, the command must  relate.to a military  duty, that is to say, the disobedience of  it must tend
 to impede, delay or prevent a military proceeding.   The German Military Code admits this in express words.   The command must be one,relating- to  military &quot;service&quot; &quot;in  I)ienstsachen.&quot;* Where an order is given  to a soldier, as has frequently been the case in the German Army during the present war, to shoot down unoffending inhabitants,  there may be an ONUS  on him to prove that this related  to his military service or duty.   And in this connection it is, I  think, of supreme importance  to  insist that any order which is  pleaded in defence should be a specific order to commit that offence and not merely a general order, the more so as military law  makes a  marked distinction, both as  regards the offence of /disobedience  and the penalties  attaching  to  it, according as the order disregarded in a general order or a specific command.   The distinction is  clearly  made  in English and American  military  lawt and may, I  think, be  inferred from certain  words in the German co,de.t   A general order  not to spare the inhabitants, for example, is entitled to  less consideration- tion,  if any,  as a defence  than  a  specific command  to shoot a particular person or persons.   It  must always, however, be borne in mind that a soldier&apos;s first duty is to obey.  In military law  the onus is on the soldier to prove the clear illegality of an order which  he has disobeyed; it would  therefore be,inequitable in criminal proceedings  to put upon him the onus  of proving the legality of  a  command which he HAS obeyed.  It must also be remembered that things which are PRIMD FACIE unlawful  in peace immediately, by the mere fact of  hostilities,  become presrimptively lawful in war. I  And even in peace-time a soldier would seem to be entitled to  a presumption that orders apparently regular and  valid  are lawful.II                               III.                          GERMAN LAW.   If, therefore, we are to follow  any rule at all, it must be sucha rule as we can extract from the laws of war arid the militaryusages of the respective belligerents.  We must avoid  altogetherthe decisions of English courts, which have little to  do with warand nothing at all to do with  acts clone against enemies.  I wouldlike to enter a  word of caution against all attempts to  extract a rule of jurisprudence from the decisions of English  courts in sucha matter as this and to apply it to the conduct of German soldiers.  * Militiir-strafgesetzbuch,  sees. 921  94 and 95 (which is to be  read with sec. 94) on&quot;Disobedience&quot; (TJngehorsam),.  The Frenoh code, which is almost as absolute on thesubject of obedience, is to  be read subject to the same qualifications. Cf.AugierandPoittevin, Droit Penal Militaire, I., p. 71, note 1.  f For example. Army Annual Act, sec. 9, note 9, disregard  of a &quot; general order &quot; is nottreated as &quot;disobedience&quot; but as &quot;negleot&quot;  under sec. II, and the punishment in thelatter case is far less severe.  Cf. also Article 21  of the U.S. Articles of War on dis-obedience, of which Winthrop says: &quot; It is  also  agreed by rriilitary writers that the&quot; command &quot; contemplated by the Article is an express and personal one, that is to say, anorder of a specific character addressed or given to the aocused in person, in contradistinctionto one of a general scope, as one issued to the command of which the aocused is a member and applying to him no more than the rest.- Winthrop, II., 885.

 To do so is to confuse municipal law with International law.   If we attempt to do it, a German officer or soldier on trial for these offences will  he entitled to say:  &quot; You are applying municipal law.   Very  well.   Then as you judge the  conduct of  British soldiers by English law, my conduct must lie judged by German law.&quot;  He might  plead this in mitigation; he might plead it in bar.    His  plea would be formidable.  An(d what is more, German law  would go far to justify him.  The German Military Code, unlike our Army Act, never contemplates, in the sections  dealing with  Disobedience (&quot; TJngchorsam &quot;),* the possibility of a com- mand being  not &quot;lawful&quot; even in time  of peace.  The words used  are as a rule &quot;Disobedience of  a  command in a matter of service &quot; (&quot; Ungehorsam gegen einen Befehl in Dienstsachen &quot;). The principal section (Section 95) is as follows:       If one of the acts indicated in Section 94t is committed before            an assembled body of men, or against an order to take            up arms, J or.when under arms,  the offender  incurs            confinement or detention in a fortress up to five years;            if in the field the same for not less than one year.  In            less grave cases, if the deed is not committed  in  the            field, not against an order to take up arms,  and  not            under arms, the penalties are modified to 14 clays of            close arrest.               If  such  an act is committed  in the  face  of  the            enemy, imprisonment  for not less than 10 years is            incurred.  If the act amounts to obedience being ex-            pressly  by word or  deed refused to an order given in            the face of the enemy, the death penalty is ineurreVt;            in less grave cases imprisonment for not  less  than .10            years or imprisonment for life. Supposing  the orders thus given involve a breach of the civil law, ie., the ordinary criminal law?   The contingency is dealt with in  another section  of the Military  Code,  which  is  sufficiently remarkable.   It is as follows:       If through the execution of an  order in a matter of service $            a  penal law (i.e., the  ordinary  criminal  law)  is            violated,  the person who  gives  the order  is  alone            responsible.  The subordinate who obeys it incurs the            punishment of an accomplice (Theilnehmer)  if-              (.1)  he has exceeded the order given him;              (2)  it  was known  to -him  that the  order of  the                    superior related to  an act  which  aimed  at                    (bezweckte) a civil or military offence or mis-                    demeanour  (Section  47). * Milititr-strafgesetzbuch, sees. 92-96. t Section 94 states that if anyone expressly refuses obedience or manifests his dis-obedionce by words, gestures, or other behaviour, likewise one who questions an order ofhis superior given him on service or a  reproof, or who persists in disobedience&apos; After anorder has been repeatedly received in a matter of service, then such an  one is  liable to close arrest for not less than 14 days or confinement up to three yearp. J &quot; Unter das Gewehr ssu treten &quot; an expression which it is difficult to translate literallybut which is interpreted by the commentators to mean any service involving the use ofarms or the display of armed force. It does not necessarily mean &quot; active service.&quot; g Much, of course, turns on what is a &quot; Dif-nstsaohe.&quot;  The editors of the Military Code(R and R. p, 181) exp&apos;ain it.as every relation for the regulation of which some activity isrequired from the nature of the military power.  This is very vague and they contentthemselves with saying that it is impossible to prescribe what exactly it is,
    In what is in many ways the best and  most authoritative com-  mentary on  the Military Code, that of Ilomen and Rissom,* who  support their comments with plentiful citations from  the judg-  nicnts of the Imperial Military Court (the Reicbsmilitargericht),  this section  is interpreted as follows:        &quot; The consequence of the principle of military trustf is  the            immunity of the subordinate  in  the execution of an            order in matters of service.  He is only responsible if            it was known to him not only  that the act to be . done            amounted US (I matter of  fact to culpable  (strafbar)            conduct,  but that the superior had ordered the  act            conscious of its unlawfulness and culpability.  Or, as            the Imperial Military Court,  XIII., 185, and to  the            like effect XIX., 190,  expresses it, it is not sufficient            to  prove  knowledge of  the  existence of  the general            culpable intention (Vorsafz) of the superior, but  the            subordinate must know  (i.e., must have known) that            the superior is  acting  with the view (in der Absicht)            of attaining an unlawful object by means of&apos; the corn-            mission of an offence or  misdemeanour.! &quot;   In other words, the soldier, before he dares to disobey an order, nufst  be convinced not only that the order is  wrong, but that the officer who gives it knows it to be wrong, and that his officer&apos;s knowledge is guilty  knowledge.   Only  when he is convinced of this is the soldier liable to punishment in a civil court for the execution of  an unlawful order.   It is clear that the German rule is the  reverse  of the English one.  In  English law, in the case of  the soldier  who, in obedience to orders, commits  a breach of the law, his  guilt is  imputed; in  German law the imputation is his  innocence.   And  this, be it remembered,  is  in time  of peace. It  must  not  be forgotten  that the standpoint  of German law  is the exact opposite  of our own, where  the  acts  of public officials, whether  civil  or military, are concerned.    In English law a public official is never protected, except by statute (as in the case of  constables executing a warrant),  against  the  consequences, civil or criminal, of acting under  orders.  This is the general principle, subject to some slight  qualifications, in the case  of civil liability,  such as  Sir  Frederick Pollock had indicated  in his  book&apos; on Torts.   But in German law,  where we have to  en- counter clroit  cuhninntralif, the  subordinate  is,  according  to Lnband,  who is supported by the judgment of the Reichsgericht and the Prussian Obertribunal, bound to obey an order, however unlawful, unless it is irregular in form or on the face  of it;  he can only question,  says Laband, the form, never the substance: otherwise, he adds, the siibordinate, not the  superior,  would  be s upreme. jj_____-  * I have used the edition published at Berlin in 1916.

                               IV.                          FRENCH LAW.   French  Law is somewhat less absolute than the German.   TheMilitary Code admits no  qualification  as to the  nature of the command.   The section* says quite  unequivocally:       Est puni  de mort, avec degradation militaire, tout niilitaire           qui refuse  cPobeir   lorsqu&apos;il  est  commande  pour           marcher contre 1&apos;ennemi, ou pour tout autre service           ordonne par son chef  en  presence de rennemi ou de           rebelles  arnies.    Si liors le case  prevu par  le para-           graphe  precedent,  la desobeissance  a eu lieu sur un           territoire en etat de guerre ou de siege,t la peine est           de  cinq ans a  dix  ans de travaux  publics ou,  si  le           coupable est officier,  de la  destitution,  avec empri-           sonnement de deux ans a cinq ans.J   The Cour de Cassation has interpreted g this  to mean  that the soldier is  bound to obey &quot;all orders relative to the accomplish-nient of any military duty whatsoever.&apos;&apos;  What then happens if theorder in question is one which involves  a breach of the ordinary law?  The Penal Code, i.e., the ordinary criminal law,  providesthat &quot;no  criminal offence  is committed  when homicide,  wound-ing, or battery are ordered by the law  and  commanded by the legitimate authority.II  Thus  two elements are essential to the immunity of a person acting under orders (1) the order  must begiven  by a person  having legal authority; and  (2) it must be anorder  lawful in itself.   But in  the case of  a  soldier, unlike a civilian, it is held  that one of these elements alone is sufficient in other words, that if the  order is given him by his lawful  mili-tary superior it matters not whether the order itself is lawful ornot.  In a case which raised this very point  before the  Cour deCassation  it was urged and approved  that the duty  which theFrench soldier owes in  such a  case is that of passive  obedience;he must obey^on the instant and without question; if he is in any doubt,  he must obey first and make his representations after-wards.U   There is no difference according to French Law  betweenpeace  and  Avar  in  this  respect,  except that in  the  former&quot; extenuating circumstances &quot; may be admitted in the case of dis-obedience,  Avhile   in  the  latter  they  may   not.**    There  is,however, nothing  in  the French Code  resembling the  peculiar  * Code de Justice Militaire, Sec. 218.  t Etat tie siege is a term for which there is no equivalent iu English Law, lr.it it means&apos;such a state of affairs as in England wjuld justify the proclamation of Martial Law, w;ththis notable difference that in H&apos;ranoi the Grovurnrnent has not to justify.  I It will be noted also that there are here none of the mitigating distinctions betweendisobedience and wilful disobedience which are to be found in our own Act.  $ Augier et Poittevin II. 659.  fl Article 327.   Article 64 applies the principle generally to all  acts done under a con-straint which is too great to be resistod.  ^f&apos;Cited in Augier and Poittevin, I. 70 and II. 658.  **.lt is worthy of note that whereas French and German Law prescribe the death sen-tonco as the only sentence which a military court can  pass in certain cases, the Army Actleaves the court free in every case, even&apos;in the  case of cowardice or wilful disobediencebefore the enemy, to pass such less sentence as it thinks fit.  The words used in the ArmyJiCt wherever the death penalty is authorise 1 are &quot; Death or such less punishment as is inthis Act mentioned.&quot;  Ours is the most lenient military code in existence.
doctrine of the German Military Code that,  in any  subsequentcriminal proceedings, the presumption  shall be all in favour ofthe soldier&apos;s  having  acted  lawfully  in carrying  out an order which involved a breach of the law.   Presumably he would haveto prove constraint and  the degree of constraint. -                               V.                      INTERNATIONAL  LAW.  The question has received very little attention in InternationalLaw.  Writers, in dealing with  the  subject  of offences againstthe laws of war,  have  either  assumed that  the  offences  wereunauthorised or have fallen back upon reprisals.  They are there-fore almost uniformly silent on the point.   In the latest editionof Wheaton it is  stated (p. 478) that,  if prisoners of war have committed an offence before capture, &quot; the fact that they actedunder orders cannot furnish a valid excuse.&quot;   The fact  that thewriters who state expressly that offences against the laws of war may  be  punished, say it without qualification/&apos;  would  seem tosuggest that either they  never contemplated that such acts couldbe authorised  by  a superior officer or, if they did,  that  no such orders could  be excused.  Hollands  statement that  if  a wholecorps disregards the laws of war, e.g., by the refusal  of  quarter,any individuals belonging to  it who  are taken prisoners may betreated as implicated in the offence clearly implies that  superiororders are  no excuse;  Article 66   of the  original  AmericanInstructions is to the same  effect.   The only statement to thecontrary is that of Professor  Oppenheim, who states in his book&apos;on  International  LaAvf  and  in the  chapter  on Land warfare which he contributed to the British Manual of  Military Law that       &quot;Members  of  the armed forces who  commit  such viola-    tions of the recognised rules  of. warfare  as are  ordered by    their  Government  or by  their  commanders are not  war,    criminals and  therefore cannot  be punished  by the  enemy.     He  may  punish the officials or  commanders  responsible for    such order, but otherwise  he may only resort to the other    means of  redress (i.e., reprisals).&quot;  I can find  no authority for  the  proposition contained in thefirst  sentence  and  Professor Oppenheim gives  none.  In accord -ance  with his  usual custom he quotes no authorities in footnotesbut refers the reader to a number of authorities  at the  head ofhis chapter.   I have examined all the  authorities he thus refers to and can find nothing in them which would give the slightest  * Holland, The Laws of War on Land, sees., 117; 118;  Hall (7th edition), p. 437; the editor of the seventh edition refers, without expressing an opinion, to Professor Oppenheim&apos;view (p. 439); Westlake, pp. 488-9 ; Bluntschli, sees. 548,  640.  For French authorities, see below.  As for German writers, in addition to Bluntschli, Lueder, Ullmann and Zorn, tothe best of my recollection, never deal with the  point of justification by superior orders.Haileck (1878 edition) L, 473, says definitely, when spoaking of the immunity extended to individuals whose hostile acts are ratified by their governments, &quot; such acts, however, mustnot exceed what the laws of war have established as belligerent rights of subjects of hostile,states, for anything done in violation of the laws of war the individual is liable tppunishment.&quot;  t II,, p. 309.                                                 .
  support to his contention^   Some authority  for  his  statement  might he found in much older writers who wrote in the infancy  of International Law when almost anything done by a belligerent  was considered legitimate; for example Vattel  (Droit des  Gens,  liv. III.  ch.  II,  par.  187) says &quot;on all occasions  susceptible of  doubt,  the whole  nation, the  individuals,  and  especially  the  military, are to  submit their judgment to those who  hold  the  reins of government.   .   .   .   The  subjects,  and in particular  the military,  are  innocent, they have acted only from a necessary  obedience.&quot;  Hut there are  very  few, if any,  modern writers  who have expressed themselves in this  sense and it is difficult to  understand how so positive  a statement has found  its way into  the  Manual of Military Law  although  it seems by no  means  certain that it will  be allowed to remain  there.  Unfortunately  it  has, on  the strength  of  Professor  Oppenheim&apos;s  authority,t  found its way into the revised Instructions issued to the American  Army and published in the year  1914 under the title of &quot;Rules  of  Land Warfare.&quot;  In section 366 dealing with &quot; offences com-  mitted by armed  forces &quot; and their punishment it is stated that       &quot; Individuals of the armed forces  will not  he  punished  for      these offences in case they are committed under the orders or      sanction of their government or commanders.&quot;    The  American  Rule says &quot; will not  be  punished &quot;; Professor  Oppenheim says  they  &quot; cannot &quot; be  punished.   So dogmatic a  statement^  must be  received with extreme  caution,  if  not  repudiated  altogether.   The  subject has  lately received  some  incidental attention from M.  Louis EenaultJ  in  an article on the  subject.   &quot; De  1&apos;application  du  droit  penal  aux  faits  de  la  guerre.&quot;  His opinion is entitled to the utmost  respect but it is  somewhat difficult to discover it.   At the conclusion of his article  he inclines to the view (pp. 339, 341-2) that the exercise of a post-  bellum jurisdiction  over members of the German armed forces  is to be deprecated  because  &quot; presque toujours, c&apos;est par ordre superieur que les infractions au droit des gens ont ete commises &quot; and also  because they were probably  done  under  constraint. But as  we  have  seen, the  degree  of  constraint  (which  need not  always  have  existed)  is  a  varying one  and  the Article of the Code penal II which he cites  assumes it must be overwhelm- ing.  It is also  difficult to  reconcile  his  conclusion with his earlier statement (p. 315) that the commanders of German sub- marines who sank the Lusiitania and other such vessels could  be  * The authorities cited are Holland, Bluntschli, Takahashi, Ariga, Spaight, and (in the Revue du Droit International, 1878, Vol. X., p. 282) Landa.

The preface (p. 7)  states that &quot; especial use&quot; has been made of  his chapter on &quot; Land Warfare &quot; in the British Manual.  I understand, however, that the U. S. Government have now withdrawn their own Manual, owing to doubts on this and other points.  I I have also examined the leading French authorities, Bonfils (see 4th edition, p. 626), Despagnet (4th edition, p. 858) and Pillet, but have failed to find in them any support for Professor Oppenheim&apos;s statement.  8 Clunefs Journal du  Droit International, Vol. 42  (1915) pp. 313-344.  See also thearticle by Professor Merignhac in tho Revue generate du droit international public January,1917, pp. 1-56; on page 50 of which Merignhac discusses the question somewhat incon-clusively. He states (on p. 53) that the French military courts, in trying German prisonersof war for  breaches  of the laws of war where the &quot; constraint&quot; of superior orders wanpleaded, have refused to admit the plea.

YI.THE SCALE OF  RESPONSIBILITY-THE  POSITION  OF                     THE  EX-KAISER.  At what point, if any,  is  the  application of punishment to stop?  Is any  distinction  to  be  made between the ex-Kaiser,who issues an order, the Chief of Staff who  countersigns  it,  theArmy Commander who bases a General Order upon it, the corps commander and his subordinates who transmit it,  and the officer who superintends its actual execution?  If  we were discussing the matter in the termsvof the ordinary criminal law, there wouldbe no great  difficulty.  The last of  these  authorities  is  theprincipal, the others are accessories before the fact and Germanlaw,* like English law, holds that he  who procures  the commis-sion of  a felony is himself a felon and equally  punishable withthe doer thereof,  nor does the punishment of  the one exclude  the punishment of the other.  But we are dealing with InternationalLaw and with Military Law.   We have to distinguish betweenpeace and  war.   In time  of  peace  the sovereign of one Stateenjoys  immunity from  criminal  proceedings in the  court  of another and  from arrest in virtue of a rule  of comity based on international Law and so do the sovereign&apos;s diplomatic and otheragents the distinction lies at  the root of  the  definition  ofpiracy.   Persons who are not his agents and who act without hisauthorization  can  claim no  immunity.   In time  of  war  theposition is not so simple.   The  sovereign and  his  ministers atonce  lose their  right  to personal immunity and are  liable to capture  as  prisoners  of  war;   there  is  no ground,  remarksBluntschli for their exemption, but quite  the contrary, as theyhave usually brought  the war upon themselves, or have decided upon it, and should bear the  primary responsibility for it.t   if their sovereign immunity is gone and they  are to be treated asprisoners of  war it would seem a fortiori that,  like other  andlesser prisoners of war, they should be liable to punishment forany breaches of  the laws of war.   Renault, however, argues thatno  State has the right to &quot;punish&quot; another  State and  nobelligerent has  the right  to  punish another belligerent, usingthat term in its collective sense; you cannot punish a nation, heargues, but only individual members of it  as individuals.  Onthe  same principle  you  cannot, &quot;he adds, &quot;punish,&quot; juridicallyspeaking, the officers who  violated the neutrality  of Belgium,for that act  was done in their official capacity  as agents of theGovernment, and as for the Government it was a &quot; political,&quot; not  * See Sec. 48 of the German Penal Code (StraEgosetzbuch) dealing with an &quot; Anstif ter,&quot;i.e., any person who has intentionally determined another, whether by persuasion, force orotherwise, to do a criminal act.

4&apos;Ja criminal, offence.  Only if the officers  had invaded Belgiumwithout  authority could they be punished punished by  theirown Government as French officers can be punished in such a caseunder a  section (226) of the Code de Justice Militaire which isfounded  on the same principles as our Foreign Enlistment Act.There is  some foundation for this contention that  authorized actsdone by  officers acting as agents of their governments cannot be punished;  it lies at the root* of the  rule that &quot; francs-francs-tireurs,&quot;     enemy subjects who take up  arms without the  authority oftheir governments, are not entitled to the privileges of prisonersof war.  But the privilege  of authorized combatants, when taken prisoner, is itself qualified by the conditions that they  shall haveobserved  the rules  of war.t   And  the  breach  of Belgiumneutrality,  though a  breach of  International  Law,  was  not,strictly  speaking,  an offence against the  laws and customs  ofwar; a  wrong  done  to  a neutral  is  not a  wrong done  to abelligerent. * The only form  of  &quot; punishment &quot; of a belligerentState known to  International Law, is reprisals, and  reprisals are based  on the principle that you &quot;punish&quot; the  State  or the armies because  it  and they  are responsible for the acts of theindividual delinquents whom you have been unable to reach andover whom  they  possess  authority.  The assumption is  thatthey ought to punish them in the real sense of the word punish-nient.   All  International  agreements  have proceeded on  this principle.%   But reprisals themselves are  not punishment,  their object is not to punish an offence but  to  prevent its repetition.One writer of authority $  urges that when it is impossible  for abelligerent  to get  hold of enemy offenders reprisals  should bepractised primarily upon the  commanders and officers of the units to which these offenders  belong,  but  he  is proceeding  on theassumption that those officers  failed to prevent  the  acts  com-plained of,  not that they ordered them.   The truth is  that inter-national  lawyers have never, except by a bashful  reference  toreprisals, contemplated a case where, like  the present, the wholegovernment from top to  bottom had  authorized and perpetratedwholesale breaches of the laws  of war.   The case was unthink-able.  When Article 3 of The Hague Convention laid down thata belligerent shall he pecuniarily responsible for violation of theprovisions  of the annexed Regulations it proceeded  on the prin-ciple of  liability  in tort and&apos;not  in crime; the  belligerent was liable for the acts  of his servants, because he was their superiorand they were acting in the scope of their employment and not because  he was, or could conceivably be, an  accomplice.   Therewould be no point in saying that a  Government  was responsible  * Cf. Bluntsohli, par. 671.  f This qualification must surely apply generally to any plea of &quot; act of state.&quot;  the immunity of &quot; public acts &quot; of individuals, whoso acts nave been ratified by their govern-ments, when admitted by the TJ.S. Secretary of State in 1841, in the case of the Caroline(McLcod&apos;s case), was based by the latter on &quot; the principles of public law &quot; and &quot; by virtueof the law of nations.&quot; It was not an act, as is tho cuso with the offences charged against&apos;German armed forces, done against the Law of Nations itself.  See Halleck I., 430, Hall(7th edition), p. 324.  X Cf. Geneva Convention of 190G, Art. 28 ; Hague  Regulations, Art. 41.  The Frenchlaw of 24th July, 1913, has given effect to Art. 28 of the Geneva Convention by enipower-ing military courts to try &quot; any individual &quot; who ill-treats the woundod.  g Martens La Paix et la Guerre, p. 428.
 for acts it had ordered; there is much point  in  saying that it shall be responsible for acts it has failed to prevent.*   All this, I think, supports the  view that superior orders are no excuse.    International /Law   seems to have proceeded on  the assumption that no such orders infringing the  laws and customs of war will be given by a belligerent sovereign, whatever may be the case with Army commanders.   In practice it is not because delinquents are State agents  but&apos;in spite  of it that they  are punished.   The belligerent  offended assumes that there are cer- tain orders which  the  other belligerent would not give; if it does give them the first belligerent ignores the  fact  of  the order as being one which the other had no right to give and as therefore one which the  subordinate was under no duty to obey.  This, at any rate, was the point of view of the German Government in the case of Captain Pryatt.    They  knew, and  admitted  that they knewjt  that  the  act  for which he was tried  was  authorized and indeed ordered by the British  Government but  as a defence they ignored it.   Nor did they pretend that his conviction and execution was  an  act  of reprisal;  they contended that it was a PUNISHMENT for an offence  against the laws of war.   They  took the same ground in the case  of  two British officers who were tried and sentenced  to ten years&apos;  penal servitude  for dropping propa- gandist leaflets from&apos;the air  over  the German lines;  In this case the German Government were  fully aware,  as  appears from  the official correspondence, that the acts with which  these officers were charged  were  done under orders  and, indeed, under the instruc- tions  of  the British Government;  none the  less, in their NOTE Verbale of 28th April, 19.18, they contended that the  conviction was  &quot; not an  aot  of  reprisal  but  on legal  principles.The German  Government  is  therefore  estopped  from  pleading  the principle of superior orders.   There remains the question whether the higher atuhorities who gave the orders as well as the  officers who executed them can  be punished :   It is usual to say in such cases that &quot; reprisals &quot;  are the  proper course.    It seems  to be assumed that a  &quot; Govern- ment &quot;  or a &quot;  State &quot; cannot  be  punished.   No  doubt the basis of this assumption is that the one government is not the superior of the other, and there is the underlying assumption that it is a legal government  and that  to  punish  it is  to proscribe it  and make the resumption of relations  and the negotiation of a treaty of peace impossible.  This is normally true but the present situa- tion  is abnormal 8  and it must be  remembered that  an &quot; asso- ciated &quot; belligerent, the Government of the United States, has  *  Article 28 of the Geneva Convention of 390(5, by which the signatorv Governments undertook to adopt legislation for the repression, in time of war, of individual acts of pillage, etc., is, of course, silent on the subject  of authorized pillage, but the French legis-lativo measures, giving effect to this article, would presumably apply not only to Frenchsoldiers but to any member of the enemy forces who committed such acts within the zone of operations..  f German official statement,  reproduced in the  Times 29th July. 1916: &quot;He (CaptainFryatt) confessed that in so doing he had acted in accordance with the instructions of theAdmiralty.&quot;  X Case of 2nd Lieutenants Scholtz and Woolley (extracted from War Office papers).  5 How abnormal may be gathered from the adoption by the  ex-Kaiser  of full responsi- bility for the atrocities committed.  See the letter quoted by Mc&apos;rignhac (op. cit. p. 62),which the ex-Kaiser addressed to the Emperor Francis Joseph &quot; II faut tout mettre a feuot a sang ; cgorger hommes et fermnes, enfanta et vieillards, ne laisser debout ni un arbre niune maison.&quot;
declared that it would uot negotiate with the German dynasty.The  Hohenzollern Government was virtually declared an outlawwhich, until reconstituted, could never be again received into thecomity of nations.  It would therefore be the height of pedantryto treat the situation in accordance with, precedents; the situationitself is unprecedented.    I  can  see no reason, therefore, foraccording any  immunity  to  the higher  authorities in  Germanyany  more than to the lower.  When the Turkish  Governmentordered the exposure of British subjects on the Gallipoli Penin-peninsula  they were informed by the  British  Government that theauthorities who gave the order,  and not merely those  who ex-ecuted it, would  be  held  personally responsible.  This is  a casein point.  With the lay argument, now advanced in some quarters, thatto punish the  ex-Kaiser and his agents  is to victimize them foracts  in  which  the whole German people  were  equally involved  1am not  concerned.  But it may be remarked that as. the Germanpeople have repudiated their government  it does not lie with themto advance it.   The  German Government was an autocratic, nota responsible,  Government, and although it is no doubt true thatthe German people approved  their acts, that approval was neithera sanction nor a justification.   It is not a  case of vicarious punish-ment.   The German Government were principals and no one has ever  held that  a principal  is to go free because there also exists an.accessory  before  or after  the fact.   The law  punishes  the prin-cipal because it must, the accessory  if it can.   If a number ofpersons participate in a riot all are equally guilty but  this has never been held  to be an argument  for letting, off the  few youcatch because there are many whom you cannot catch.  The same principle holds good in military law of a mutiny.  But we havenot  to consider this.*                             VII.                       CONCLUSION.  The conclusion at  which  I  have  arrived is that all  german officers, high or low, who have ordered or executed acts amount-ing  to a violation of  &quot; the principles of the laAv of nations, de-rived from the usages established among civilised peoples, fromthe laws of humanity and  from the dictates of public conscienceshould be brought to trial.  They should be tried according tothat  military and martial law  or &quot; common law of war  &quot;  whichis recognized  in International Law as  the-  jurisdiction  of  allbelligerents, prolonged, if need be, by a stipulation in the Treatyof Peace  that  the Treaty which  is  the sole  authority for ter-minating the war shall not terminate the jurisdiction which warconfers.   It may be argued that  such a  treaty is unusual  but sowas  the &quot; armistice  &quot; wTn^li rlpfles  the  juristic  definition of an armistice  as a suspension, of arms  which shall leave each  bel-ligerent at the end of it in the position in which he was  at thebeginning.  * The conclusion I have  arrived at, as regards the prosecution of nil offenders, high orlow, appears also to be  that of Profossor Mc&apos;rignhac in the articles already cited.

  * Lueder&apos;s chapters on Kriegsrecht in Vol. IV. of Holtzendorffs Handbuch des Volker-rcchts ; Zorn, in his Das Kriegsrecht zu Lawk (190(1).  f Ameiican Instructions, Article l(i. To the same efftct Bluntschili (sees. 549,550),who insists that the plea of &quot;necessity&quot; is subject always to the measures taken in itsname being in agreement &quot; with the goneral law&quot; (&quot; mit dem allgemeinen Beoht&quot;).  % Thus Lueder, IV., 255.  If a German officer arraigned pleads superior orders, he shouldbe required to prove-    (1) that the order to commit the offence with which he is           charged  was a specific  command given him by  his.           superior  officer;    (2) that it was an order to do the precise act charged.  Such           a defence would clearly fail  if the accused exceeded           the order;    (3) that the order had reference to a military duty.  If the accused succeeds so far, his defence may still fail     (1) if the act charged is so flagrantly and obviously contrary           to the laws of war that the accused cannot be regarded           as having acted without knowledge of its illegality; or    (2) if the prosecution can  prove circumstances from which           knowledge of the illegality  can be  imputed  to  the           accused.  If the plea of superior orders does not succeed as a  defence, itmay still be relevant in two ways              *    (a) as a  circumstance to  be considered  by  the Court  in           mitigation of punishment;    (6) as connoting a  constraint which the accused could  not           resist.   The  degree  of constraint will depend upon           the consequences of disobedience according to German           law.  It may  conceivably be so great as to render the           act virtually an involuntary one.  The onus of prov-           ing this will be on the accused.  The requirement of the  proof that the  order had reference to amilitary duty is important.  Many  a command, would, no doubt,be justified by German officers or their superiors on the ground of &quot; military necessity.&quot;   It is a  plea  which should be subjected to the narrowest scrutiny.  The plea that military necessity will cover anything has  never in modern  times been  recognized in international Law;  it is peculiar  to the recent German school of&quot;barrack-room  lawyers&quot;  of whom Lueder was  the apostle  and professor Zorn is the disci pie. *   Older  German  writers  likeBluntschli, in common with all  authoritative French and Englishwriters,  condemn it utterly and  declare that &quot; military neces-sity consists  in the  necessity of those  measures which are indis-pensable for securing the  ends  of the war  and ichich.  are laivfulaccording to the modern law and usuage  of War.&quot;f  According to the  recent school  of German writers there is nosuch thing as law  in war;  there are  no  laws, even as to &quot; the pro-tection of defenceless private  persons,  wounded  and  disabled soldiers, flags of truce, sacredness of treaties  &quot; which may not beviolated in the name of necessity   ; the gravest offence  is unassail-
able from the point of view of International Law &quot;  if military necessity can be pleaded for it*); military necessity is the soleand ultimate  criterion t;  &quot;success is  its own justification &quot;j;right and force are synonymous.&quot;X  No such plea can be allowedto an officer in  favour of the presumptive lawfulness of an orderhe has executed; it will certainly be urged, but to admit it wouldbe to deny that there are laws of war at all.  He may also plead,under Sec. 47 of his own Military Code,  that he did not know thatthe  superior officer who   gave  it  &quot;intentionally pursued anunlawful object.&quot;   The value of  the  plea will  depend on thenature of the object but it will probably be found on examina-tion that many of  the offences were  committed  not merely inpursuance  of  formal  orders  but  of  exhortations to  cruelty,malignancy,  and terrorism which could leave no doubt in the mind of those who executed them that  the superior officer inten-tionally pursued &quot; an unlawful object.&quot;   This is certainly true of the exhortations addressed by the notorious Niemeyer to theguards of his prison camp.   The language  which has accom-panierl many of these orders, the form in which they were given,the incitements by which  they  were  attended, could leave nodoubt in  the mind of any reasonable man that what was contem-plated was  not  an  order in the course  of military duty  but thegratification of  a personal hate and a racial animosity.                                         J.  H. MORGAN.23rd December, 1918. .A NOTE  ON THE DEFENCE OF  SUPERIOR  ORDEES            BEFORE  A  COURT OF  NATIONS.      By the Right Hon. Sir FREDERICK POLLOCK,  Bart.  The questions to be  dealt with are unique in more than one way;                  &apos;                 -  Precedent is wholly lacking for the facts.  Before this war noone thought it possible that a Great Power should issue deliberateand  systematic orders for the commission of acts hitherto con-demned by the consent  and abhorred in the usuage of civilizednations.  The jurisdiction is likewise without  precedent.  History- fur-nishes no example of  a tribunal established by several alliedStates to do justice on offenders against rules and customs equallyrecognized  by all of them.  Such a tribunal is not bound by the rules laid down in any onejurisdiction; so far as the several rules of different nations agree,it may adopt their contents as witness of general consent.   Thesame,  may be said  of the opinions given by responsible advisers and learned authors, and of judicial decisions so far  as relevant;none of these can have  more  than persuasive authority,  though* Zom, Dan Kriegsreclit zu Lande, p. 15.I Ibid., p. 270.        t Ibid., p. 210.
their  weight cannot be trifling and  in  some cases  may be verygreat.  The tribunal has to settle  for itself (except so far as may beprovided by the instrument which creates it) both the grounds of liability  that will  support  an  accusation  and  the  admissiblegrounds of excuse.   It may  be presumed, however, that,  wherethe authorities or analogies  most nearly in point  are found todiffer in their results,  the tribunal  will  incline  to the  moremerciful view.  Otherwise it does, not seem  to matter whether adefend ent is  or is not excusable according to the service regula-tions  or  other positive rules of: national  law to which he was subject,  A  claim by  every  man to be judged,  as  a matter of right, by his own law cannot be allowed before such a  tribunalas is now contemplated.  One ground of  excuse is necessary obedience to superior orders.I say excuse  as implying admission that the act in question Wasin itself wrong.   A defence based on justification, i.e., maintain-ing that in the circumstances no wrong at all was  done, is of a wholly different nature.  Acts  of  wanton  malice or excessive  violence  done  withoutorders, ^ven   though they may  be  winked at  or  irregularlyencouraged by superiors such  as assaults on prisoners of war-are, of course, inexcusable.   Nothing that here  follows  is appli-cable to offences of that kind.  In  principle there is nothing new in the problem of conflictbetAveen  a particular obedience such as is due  to a military orother superior in  office, or to  the temporal sovereign and a more general and  higher  obedience.   Cicero  defended Cassius in the senate for having  exceeded his authority  for  the purpose ofrescuing oppressed people in a case  of  urgency.  The medievaldoctors laid it down that  commands  even of one&apos;s lawful princecontrary to  the law of nature  (identical  for this purpose withuniversally recognised rules of morality) ought not to be obeyed;but they added the  caution  that there  is a strong presumptionin favour of  the prince&apos;s  command being justifiable; in  other words, the wrongfulness of the command will justify disobediencewhen, but only when, it is manifest.  One can  hardly imagine,to take a strong example, that any medieval  Catholic soldierwould have obeyed his sovereigns command to kill a man acknow-leged to  be the duly elected Pope.  It is well to remember that laws of war and customs of the seawere known,  like the law  merchant, long before  the system of modern international law was framed.   All these were conceivedas deriving their  authority from natural reason  evidenced by thecommon  consent of mankind or the  classes of men specially concerned.  Excuses for breaking a rule assumed to be binding on at leastall  members  of  civilized  commonwealths must rest on  some reasonable ground.   Ignorance  of the rule is not such a ground;it rather stands itself in need of excuse.  But  ignorance of thecircumstances that make the  act in question  a breach.of the rulemay be excusable or unavoidable in all but the most  flagrantcases.    In  particular a  subordinate is bound  throughout theordinary course of  service (more especially  but not exclusively
 in warlike service) to presume that the orders of a superior whom he is regularly bound to obey are lawful and proper.   In order, therefore, to hold the inferior liable for the execution of superior orders, it must be shown that the order was manifestly wrongful,  i.e., such that he actually knew or with the means of knowledge then and there  at his command ought to  have known it to be wrongful.  The degree  of knowledge and intelligence to be expected  of  the  inferior  will evidently vary with his  rank and  education, and no fixed rule can be laid down to measure it. But it may be said, at the  lowest point  of the scale, that it seems extremely  difficult in any case to hold a  man guilty who, not  him- self  being in any position of responsible authority, acts as a  mere instrument in executing an order of a kind  recognized as usual in the course of service.  (Elementary examples: the men of a firing party told  off to  shoot a deserter have  not to satisfy themselves of the facts,  or that  the process  of the court-martial  was correct. But  if the same men are ordered  to shoot unarmed priests, women and  children, they must know that this  is not a usual act  of  war, and  further questions then arise.)  A  man under authority  and having  others under  him, whose duty is to receive  and transmit orders and see that they  are performed, but  not  to execute them in person, will, as  a rule, have some  discretion as to the manner of execution, and must be answerable for exercising that discretion justly and  reasonably. The  degree of intelligence to be required  of him must  depend on his rank and education and the nature of the case.  If a superior gives an order which does  not on the face of it reasonably appear to be in the ordinary  course of service (that is, such an order as is in common practice given and obeyed without question) the inferior must judge of its propriety for himself, and  acts upon it at his own risk. This  is not a frequent  case.  A  distinct ground  of  excuse  is compulsion.  The order  was wrongful;  the inferior knew or ought to have known it;  but he was  under  constraint and  had no choice but to obey.   Here it seems that, in order to  amount to a good excuse, the constraint must be overpowering.  There must be  fear of  death or of some evil  comparable to it in gravity, such fear as a man  of ordinary courage cannot resist:  &quot; qui caclit in constantem virum &quot;  as the Roman lawyers said.  It  remains to add  that, as we learn from the common  experi- ence  of justice in criminal  matters, facts alleged in  defence but not sufficient for justification or  excuse are  not to be  wholly dis- regarded.   They  may still have their  effect in mitigating  the sentence.   The propriety and  the measure  of such mitigation  extending,  it may he, to  the imposition of a merely nominal penalty are in the judicial  discretion of the Court and  not definable by rule. . One practical result of the foregoing  considerations is  that itcan hardly be useful  to take proceedings against merely minis-terial agents unless  in  gross and extreme  cases where the   act committed  is such as to shock any plain inan&apos;s conscience.

DE MONTMORENCY (Secretary),  The Sub-Committee has held seven meetings and has revieweda considerable amount of printed  and imprinted evidence sup-plied by the Government Committee on the treatment of british prisoners of War by the German Authorities.  The  following  Memoranda  have  been  considered  and  areappended to  this  Interim Report:      1.  The history of the transfer of British Prisoners of War          to Russia.    2.  The conditions in German working camps on the Russian          Front.    3.  The conditions obtaining in certain German  mines  and          quarries, used for the detention and employment of          British Prisoners of War.    4.  German  working camps  on the Western Front and the          responsibility of  the German  Higher Command.    5.  Organisation of the German military system.  -Working Camps on the Eastern Front.  (Memoranda 1 and 2.)  In April and May, 1916,  German Prisoners of War were  sent from England to work  at Rouen  and  Havre  unloading cargoesother than  munitions of war.  On May 15th, 1916, the BritishGovernment were informed through the American Embassy  thatthe German Military Authorities had in  consequence decided tosend 2,000  British Prisoners of War to work in occupied Russianterritory, under conditions  similar to those  existing  at Rouenand Havre.  On the  same date the  American Ambassador  was informed by the British Government that the representatives ofthe American Embassy  at Paris could visit the  depots at Rouenand Havre.  Similar facilities for British Prisoners  of War inRussia were demanded by the British Government on May 29th,1916.  This was not granted until  June, 19.17, except  in the  caseof a visit by Mr. Jackson, the American representative,  to Libauon  October 16th, 1916.
   The 2,000 prisoners, divided into four parties of 500 each known as E.K..1, E.K.2, E.K.3 and E.K.4, were collected from different camps in Germany and sent to Angersee, Mitau, Wainoden and Liban,  respectively,  the  whole being under the  command  of Landwehr Captain Forster.  From these central camps the men were sent to a number of working camps, where,  generally speak- ing, the accommodation was of the roughest description, the water supply  bad or non-existent, the&apos;sanitary  arrangements very  iu- ferior,  and various forms of cruel  and brutal punishment were inflicted.   Complaints by the British Government led to a visit in June or July, 19.16, to the main  Courland camps by Captain Draudt of the Department of Prisoners of War at the German War Office.  His Eeport mentioned by name many British N.C.Os.  as being reliable men.   The  statements of some of  these have been obtained and steps  are being taken  to secure the evidence of the rest.  By a Note  Verbale, of January 24th, .1917, the German Government alleged  that German Prisoners of  War  &quot; suffered from inadequate food, defective accommodation (only tents being- provided in many cases), as well as being subjected  to hard work and irregularity in the matter of mails.&quot;  They asked that the prisoners should be  moved thirty kilometres behind the firing line and provided with suitable.accommodation.  The complaint con- tained in this  Note was answered by the British Government on February 8th, 1917,  with the assurance  that the  prisoners  re- ceived the   same food as the British  troops; 75 per cent, were in  huts, the  remainder being, like   many British troops,  in specially warmed tents provided with floor-boards; that strict orders had  been given against  their being employed within the range of German gun-fire, but that one man had been wounded by a shell fired at an exceptionally long range.  Notwithstanding this answer, 50Oi British prisoner of war -were placed under the most terrible conditions within  range of the Russian guns.  The horrors  of the inarch  to the camp are established beyond doubt, and  the conditions  of  life during the rigour of  a  Russian winter, constituted torture of the  most deliberate kind; the accommoda- tion and treatment were bad, the men were not allowed  to receive any  parcels and were deliberately starved;  there Avas  no water supply; suffering from frostbites was  general,  and  many of the men died  as the result  of the  treatment.   That this was a de- liberate act on the part of the Higher Command is shown both  by the threat  of  reprisals, which  the  German Government made, and  by  the  fact that the  500  British  prisoner were paraded  at the camp  and  a notice  was  read out to them  stating that they were to be subjected to reprisals, that  they would have to work in the firing line,  get bad treatment,  bad food,  bad accommo- dation, and that thirty-six of  them bad to die.   At the end  of April, 1917, there were  only 77 men left in the camp out of 500 driven there in February  (23 having died and 400  having been sent  to hospital) and of these 47 were certified by  the doctor to  be unfit to leave their beds.   The  names of Lieutenant  Prahl of the Reserve Artillery and Lieutenant Krael of the 2nd  Jager Regi- ment have been given as being in command of the  camp where these men were confined.  This camp is variously known under
the names of La token or Kalzien.  Captain Forster was in chargeof the whole commando of 2,000,  In  the  opinion of the Sub-Committee,  Lieutenant Prahl and lieutenant Krael or other the  otficer or officers in command  ofthe camp at  Latchen, Kakden, on the Russian Front, from thebeginning of February,  19.17, to the end of April,  1917, CaptainForster or other the officer in charge  of the commando of 2,000prisoners  for  the same  period  the local  Army Commander orCommanders and the Minister  of  War during the same period should  be held  responsible for  the  offences against  british prisoners  of war committed at the above camp.Mines and Quarries in Germany.  (Memorandum 3.)  The Sub-Committee  has considered  the cases  of five  stonequarries,  namely, Neanderthal,  Neubeckum, Wulfrath,  Hagen,Elbingevoden; four  coal  mines,  namely,  Borbeck,  AugustaVictoria, Aplerbeck and  Westernholt; and  six salt mines, namely,Beienrode, Heygendorf, Gfrasleben, Bhman, Gluckauf and Lune-burg, where  British prisoners  of war were employed.  Nearly all the cases disclose evidence (1)  that the  prisoners werenot humanely treated ; (2)  that the food supplied was insufficient,especially for men engaged in hard manual labour; (3) that the accommodation was in  many  instances very  bad; (4)  that thesanitary arrangements were deplorable; (5) that the work givento the prisoners was excessive,  having regard to their health and capacity;  (G) that they were forced to work under threats and by being assaulted; (7) that they were beaten by sentries and otherswith impunity; (8)  that the life was really a life of slavery.  The Sub-Committee have applied the ordinary tests of a prose-cution to  the evidence that is to say:      1st. What was the offence against the laws  and usages of          war ?    2nd. If there  was an offence,  can the offender be identified?    3rd. What was the degree of responsibility of the offender,    *     having regard to his position ?    4th. Was the offence committed on his own initiative or was          he obeying orders, or carrying  out a system?    5th. What is the reliable and admissible evidence available          in support ef the charge?    6th. What would be the probable defence to  the charge?    7th.-Could the alleged offender  be put on his trial with a          reasonable probability of conviction?  It  would  be very  difficult,  on  the material now  available,satisfactorily to prove offence  against individual  officials at thedifferent mines,  partly because of the difficulty of  identification,and partly because the  responsibility could be shifted from oneto the other.  For instance,  it  would  be said  that they were  only carryingout the regulations, that the amount of work to be done was fixed,that the doctor decided  whether a man was fit for work or not,that the food available was distributed,  that the punishmentsinflicted were authorised,  that the prisoners&apos; were insubordinate,
 refused to work and attempted to escape, and that with regard to their general treatment, it was the same as that of  the German civilians.   It will be  important, on the question of responsibility, to pro- cure copies of the regulations in force at the different places as to the amount of work, the punishments that were authorised, &amp;c, and to trace the origin of these regulations.   A selection should be made  of the best witnesses in the case of each mine, and proofs carefully taken to ascertain what they can speak to definitely  from their own  knowledge.   The Sub-Committee considers it desirable that the persons re- sponsible for the system should be  proceeded against,  and as at present advised these persons are the commandants of the  parent camp, the focal army commander and the Minister of War.   The German military organisation should he  considered  in relation to these cases.   The Sub-Committee considers  it probable that  when  further evidence  has been  obtained, charges  may he made  against  the commandants or other  individuals  in control of the  mines and quarries where offences against prisoners of war were committed. German Working Comps on the Western Front. (Memorandum 4.)   The  Sub-Committee  have   considered the Memorandum (4) which dealt  in detail with the conditions prevailing behind  the lines on the  Western Front.   They are satisfied that the evidence showed that the British prisoners were treated with inhumanity, that they were exposed to  shell fire, were  forced to work on munitions of Avar,  AA-ere  underfed and overworked, that the ac- commodation in many cases Avas disgraceful, that the ordinary requirements of health Avere completely neglected.   They  are of opinion that the evidence  at  present available  shows that this treatment was  the  result of  a system which the Germans  pro- fessed  to  adopt  by  Avay of  reprisal, and which Avas carried  into effect by the orders of the Higher  Command.  Fort Macdonald (Mons en  Barocul)  is the cardinal  instance of  inhumane treat- ment  not  complicated by overAvork.  In the other cases terrible effects  on  the prisoners resulted from  the  combination of starvation-,tion, overwork,  defective accommodation, insanitary surroundings and brutal treatment, aggravated in some instances by AAforking under shell fire and working on munitions of war.  Your Sub-Committee are of opinion, subject to possible modi- fications Avhen complete evidence is. forthcoming,   1.  That the folloAving persons should be brought to trial:      (a)  The Commandants of Fort Macdonald, the Commandants          or Governors  of  Lille,. the  local Army Commanders          and  the  Minister of War  during the period  from          January  1, 1917, onwards.    (b) The  Commandants of all camps on the Western  Front          Avhere prisoners worked  under shell fire or at work          directly  connected  with  the  operations of war.   The          evidence  on this  head is at-present very incomplete          and much further information will probably be  forth-          coming from the  prisoners  who are now returning to          this country.
   2. That  there is ample evidence that the British prisoners of war were systematically treated with inhumanity in the German working camps behind the firing line on the Western Front, but as  there is ground for believing that the list of camps  is not complete and as an enormous mass of fresh evidence is now coming to  hand it  is impossible  at the present time to do more than indicate that the system wras one which is shown to have emanated from the  Higher Command,   that the  Minister  of  War  was ultimately  responsible for it and that it is necessary to consider the effect of the further evidence which will be  available  before cominn; to  a conclusion on  the question what local army com- manders, commandants of camps or other persons should also be held responsible.   The Sub-Committee wish to add that on the evidence which they have considered up to the present the com- commandants are hardly every referred to by the prisoners, and that in none  of  the cases relating to the Western Front Avhich have been investigated is the name of any commandant supplied.  The  Sub-Committee have been informed by the Hon.  Secretary of the  Government Committee  on the  Treatment of Prisoners of War by the enemy  what  steps are being taken to secure the evidence of  the prisoners who are now returning  to this country.  Each prisoner on landing is required to fill in  a card with the name of each camp in which he has been confined and to answer certain  questions  which have been drafted with  special view to the work of this Committee.  Up to this date some 70,000 of these cards and answers have been received, and a further 80,000 are yet to be received.  Steps are being taken to sort, index and analyse the information con- tained  in these documents, and until this has  been  done it will be impossible even to be satisfied as to the value of the incriminat- ing statements already made or to be certain that the worst cases have been discovered.  Your Committee has also passed the following  resolution withrelation to the discovery of documents in the hands of the enemy,and they desire to refer to the Main Committee  the question asto what action  (if any) should be taken  to preserve such  docu-ments from  destruction :        &quot; That  it should be a term in  the Treaty of  Peace that    the enemy  Government shall supply in such  manner as may    be determined at  the Pea&apos;ce Conference          &apos;&apos; (a) The names of all persons in command or charge        of  or in any way  exercising  authority in or over all        civilian  internment camps,  prisoner of war camps,        branch camps, working camps  and  commandoes and        other places  where prisoners were confined in any  of        their dominions, or in territory at any time occupied by        them,  with  respect to which such information  is re-        quired, and  all orders and  instructions  or  copies  of        orders  or instructions and reports in their possession        relating to the administration and discipline of all such        places in respect of which the supply of such documents        as  aforesaid  shall  be  demanded,

F. PETERSON.17th December, 1918.                        APPENDIX.                    MEMORANDUM  I.HISTORY OF THE  TRANSFER OF BRITISH PRISONERS  OF WAR TO                          RUSSIA.  Early in 1916 considerable shortage of labour arose at the ports of Havre and Rouen in connection with unloading  ships, etc.It was accordingly decided  to send there a certain  number ofGerman prisoners of war from this country in order to relieve the congestion.  750  German prisoners of war  were despatched toRouen on the 5th April, 700 to Havre on the 26th April, and afurther party of 500  to Havre on the 6th May.   These prisoners were engaged under British supervision in clearing cargo ships ofgoods other than munitions of war and on other  work which didnot include handling in any way of  munitions  of  war.    Theregulations obtaining in the  camps at Havre and Rouen wereprecisely similar to those existing in camps in this country.  On the 15th May,  1916, the American Ambassador in Londoncommunicated to the British Government the text of  a telegram which had been received from the Embassy at  Berlin, statingthat the German  Military  Authorities had,  in view of  this transfer,  decided to send 2,000 British  prisoners  of war to workin Russian territory under German occupation.   A  subsequentcommunication stated that these prisoners would  be put to work under the same conditions as those obtaining in  the case  of the prisoners transferred from England to France.  These prisoners were,  in fact, so transferred to Russian terri-tory where they were kept under conditions of the most extremehardship, as  can be seen from  the evidence collected by theGovernment Committee, to  which  it  is unnecessary to-make further reference here.  The American Ambassador was informed on the 15th May that the depots at Havre and Rouen might bevisited by representatives of the American Embassy at Paris, theUnited States of America then being the Power charged with the
   care of German interests in this country and in France, and  a   demand was made by us  on the 29tji May that similar facilities   might be accorded to representatives of the American Embassy   at Berlin in  regard to the camps in  Russian territory where   British prisoners were located.    In  spite of  all efforts made by the American Ambassador and   subsequently by the Netherlands Minister, into whose  hands the   care of British interests in Germany devolved on the entry of the   United States of  America into  the war, permission to visit the   camps in Russia  (with  the exception of a visit paid  by Mr.   Jackson of the American  Embassy  to Libau on the 16th October,   1916) was persistently refused by the German Authorities, and it   was not until June, 1917, that a representative of the  Netherlands   Legation was  able to visit these camps.   The conditions had by   this time been materially improved, and a comparatively favour-   able report  was rendered by M.  Van Vredenburch.  There is,   however, a volume of evidence to  show that for a  considerable   period after their transfer to Russian territory British prisoners   were  subjected to  conditions which  were  deliberately  rendered   almost intolerable and, to  a regime of calculated brutality. In con-   sequence of  the bad  conditions  known to exist at the camps in   Russia the German prisoners were brought back  from Havre and   Rouen to England  in July,  1917, on an undertaking that   the Germans  would then  re-transfer the  British  prisoners in   Russia to camps in Germany, an  undertaking which was duly-   carried out by the German Authorities.                     MEMORANDUM  II.  .      THE CONDITIONS IN  GERMAN  WORKING CAMPS  ON THE                        RUSSIAN FRONT.    In the late Spring of 1916 the German Government informed  the British Government that in consequence of the  employment  of German prisoners in France they intended to transfer 2,000  British prisoners to Russian territory.  Accordingly, in May of  that year 4 parties of 500  each, known as E.K. 1, E.E.  2, E.K. 3  and E.K. 4,  were collected from different camps in Germany and  sent to Angersee, Mitau, Wainoden and Libau respectively.  The  whole  were under  the  command of Landwehr Captain  Forster  (report of Capt. Draudt forwarded by the Berlin Foreign Office  to the American Embassy  on Aug.,9, .1916).   The accommodation  at Angersee was admittedly not good, but a fresh camp was pre-  pared at Talsen, which seems to have been fair.  A full descrip-  tion of these four camps will be found in  Captain Draudfs report  from  which  it is evident that at  first  the accommodation was  unsatisfactory, but by June it had materially improved, and I  do not think any charge in respect of it could be  supported.    The men were sent out  from these four central camps for road  making,  farm work and the like to many  places  of which we  have information with regard to the following: Aezenpoth, Alden-  burg,  Altauz, Brunnenwiskey, Frankenburg, Garracken, Jacobi,  Jwaccwiezi, Kelzien, Neuhausen, Plawen, Rochaison, Volkawich,  Windau and Zerren.
  The accommodation at these places was, generally speaking, ofthe roughest description, the water supply bad or non-existent,and the sanitary arrangements disgraceful.   There are the usualcomplaints about food and the roughness of the guards, and the punishment of tying to a tree is alleged to have been  inflictedin its most brutal form with the victim&apos;s feet off the ground.  Complaints made by the British Government led  to a visit inJune or July by Capt. Drauclt, assistant to General rriederich,the General in supreme command of the prisoners of war to themain  Courland  camps.  His  report is  of  importance  for thepresent purpose in that it mentions by name many British N.C.Os.as being reliable nien.  The statements of some of these  havealready been taken, and special  steps should be taken to obtainstatements from them all a list is given below.  Another witnesswhose  evidence it  is important to secure  if possible is that ofPetty  Officer  Picton-Warlow, a  man  of  education, copies  of whose letters in the possession of the Prisoners of War Committeeseem to show that during the summer of 1916 conditions were not so bad, though other prisoners Moffatt 9026, Cheshire Eegt.;Cooper 8813, Cheshire Regt.; Malcom, Cheshire Regt.;  Sheilds,2nd Seaforths; McCulloch 8295, 2nd Seaforths; and Starr, 4thDragoon Guards (from none of whom has the  Government Com-mittee yet obtained a statement) do not take the same view.  The  German Government having for a long time refused (formilitary reasons) to allow neutral inspection of camps in Russianterritory at last permitted Mr.  Jackson, of the American Em-bassy, to visit Libau in October of 1916.  He reported favourablyof this  place,  probably  correctly, for by that time it had  beengot in order, and at least three of the witnesses already examined by the Committee King, No. .1736, Soder, No. 2204  and  Sugden,No. 1832 give a more or less favourable description of the place,the last named saying:  &quot; Libau camp was the best I was in dur-ing my detention as a prisoner.&quot;  However this may be, the conditions seem to have remained asthey were till the &quot;end of 1916.  By a Note V erbale of the  GermanGovernment dated January 24, 19.17, and received by the BritishGovernment February 7,  the German Government  made  com-plaint that a considerable number of German prisoners were beingdetained by the British in France behind the fighting front.  Thefollowing words are of the utmost importance: &quot; These prisonerssuffer from inadequate food, defective accommodation (only tentsbeing provided in many cases), as well as being subjected to  hardwork and irregularities in  the matter of  mails.&quot;    They  corn-plained that some of them were exposed to German gun fire which4( has resulted in several of them being killed.&quot;  They demanded that the prisoners &quot; should be  immediatelyremoved to a distance of at least 30 kilometres behind the firingline and provided there with  accommodation in accordance  withthe season of the year and hygienic needs, further, in respect oftheir postal arrangements, should be placed on the same footing as British prisoners in  Germany.&quot;    In default of  the BritishGovernment notifying their compliance  with these  demands bythe 1st February  &quot; a number of British prisoners, will be trans-
 erred from camps in Germany to tho area of operations  in the Western theatre of war where, in respect of employment, accom-modation, food, and the question of mails, they will be treated in a manner corresponding&apos; to the practice of the British militaryauthorities &quot; which  means, of course, the practice  alleged bythe  Germans,  i.e., insufficient  food,  defective accommodation(only tents), hard work and  irregular mails.  In reply, the British Government, in a Note Verbale for trans-mission to  the  German Government, dated February 8th, .1917,gave the explicit assurance  that the prisoners received the samefood as the British troops,  that 75 per cent,  were in lints, theremainder being.like  many British  troops in specially warmedtents with floor boards, that strict orders had been given against their being employed within the range of German gun fire thoughit was regretted  that one man had  been wounded by a shellwhich must have been fired at exceptionally  long range,  this being the only casualty which had occurred.  It is incredible that in any circumstances, and especially aftersuch an explicit assurance by a responsible  minister, any personscould be inhuman  enough  to reproduce  in the  depth of therigorous  winter  in Russia the  conditions in  which  german prisoners were alleged to have lived  at Havre  and in the neigh-bourhood  of Rouen.    Yet this was  done, and  done, as theevidence at the disposal of the Committee makes abundantly clear,by the order of some superior authority in Germany.  Within ten days of the date of the British reply, 100- men ofthe R.N.D. were sent to Libau, where a further 400 were sent,and  they were  &quot;officially informed &quot; that they would be sentto the trenches between Riga and Mitau and remain  within the artillery  zone  by way of reprisal.   On February 25 these 500men were forced to inarch 35&apos; kilometers up the frozen River Aa,often through snowdrifts knee deep.  &apos;Sledges  followed to pickup the men Avho  broke down from exhaustion, while the escortof Lilians drove the stragglers on with lances and whips.  Thosewho  fell were robbed  of their kit and property.  Two sergeants,Gibbs and  West  (specially mentioned  by  Capt.  Dratidt as goodmen), remonstrated, and were singled out for special  ill-treat-ment on the march.  Of the 500 who started,  120-130&apos; are saidto have collapsed on  the march.  &quot; They were brought  in  bytransport later, but through their lying in the  snow they werefrost bitten in the hands  and feet.&apos;&apos;  The  horrors  of this march  are  established  beyond  doubt  bynumerous witnesses...Arrived at their destination,  the men were kept waiting outsidea &quot; cavalry tent  built on the ice  of  (marsh by) the river.  Ithad  wire beds on three racks, the bottom  one being about onefoot from the ground,  so that the weight of a man&apos;s body weighedit down till he was lying on the snow or the ice.&quot;  The  next  morning  they were paraded and a notice was readout giving  the  reasons why  they were there.  The substance of
 this notice is given in the following words by Hookham, Private, R.N.D.:-       &quot; You  are  here  on a reprisal because the English have     German prisoners  working in  the  firing line in France.     They  have bad accommodation, bad food, bad  treatment;     they are  under fire and 30 men have  lost their lives.  In     return, you are to  work here in the firing line and will get     bad treatment, bad  food, bad  accommodation,  and 36 of     you have got to die.&quot;   The substance of this order and the fact  that it was read out is given by another witness, Lumsden, A.13., R.N.D., examined by a different examiner and on a different day to Hookham, and described by him as a witness  of a high  order  of intelligence and great  powers  of observation.  The way in which it corre- spondswith the substance of the Note Verbaleoi the 24th January, already  quoted, cannot  escape notice, any  more than the fact that the accommodation provided, corresponds with the complaint that some  of the Germans at Havre and Rouen were lodged in tents.   There  can  be  no possible doubt  that this order, read out as- it  was,  was inspired if not actually issued by those responsible  for the terms of the Note Verbale.  Lumsden adds several points-to the notice, of which one of the most important is the characteristically  false statement that these steps had been  taken after three months&apos; notice to the British Government, of which no notice had  been taken.  (It will be remembered that the threat  was to  transfer men to the Western front, that the reply of the British  Government was dated the day after the  receipt of the German note,  and that the men of the R.N.D. were moved to Libau  on February  18th.) But this falsehood of  a subordinate is  perhaps not surprising, for when the men had been in this place for a.week the &quot; German Government informed  the Netherland Minister at  Berlin, in  a Note Verbale dated March 5th, that British prisoners of war had not yet been sent  quite  close to the German firing line. on the Russian  front.&quot;  (Miscellaneous, No. 7, 1918, p. 16.)  The  threats contained in  this notice were carried  out to -the letter.   The accommodation  was  bad, the treatment was bad, the food Avas bad,  and  numbers of men  died, while more lost toes, fingers or hand through frost bite.  The tent was a large  cavalry tent pitched on the frozen marsh, with a foot or more of snow  and  ice inside and frequently  under shell fire.  There were  some small stoves, but no fuel or entirely inadequate  fuel was provided.   The &quot; revier stube &quot;  was  a wretched peasant&apos;s cottage (in which the  guard also  was quar- tered) in charge of a brutal sanitater.  Men in the last stages of illness were sent by sledge to Mitau.  When the thaw came the tent  was moved to Pinne, on the other side of  the  river,where deep mud took the place of snow and ice inside the tent.  There  was no water  supply;  such water as there was, was obtained  by melting ice from the river or by digging  down intothe marsh, where filthy polluted water was  obtained.  Most- ofthe men had no wash during the whole time they were  there.
  The treatment was bad.   Were it not established beyond thepossibility of doubt,  the story would be unbelievable.   Men were driven out  to work breaking ice on the river, felling  trees,making and repairing  trenches  under lire when they  could hardly stand, and  had to be supported by their comrades to andfrom  their  work.&apos;    One man  died while being carried home;another, who had fallen exhausted on his way back to camp, was shot at point blank range by the sentry; while a third  man, who did not turn out quick enough one morning, was  first abusedand then  attacked  with a  bayonet by  the  sanitiiter;  further investigation disclosed the  fact that his sleep was the  sleep  of death, he  had been  dead some  hours, frozen  in his bunk.  Theonly  punishment  was tying to the post outside  the tent for two hours after the  men returned from work, under  conditionshardly differing from crucifixion.   Sergt-major Gibb, of theGordon Highlanders relates how,  having been urged  by theInterpreter  to  write home  how  they were  being  treated,  heeventually did so: &quot;next day,&quot; he proceeds, &quot; I got  the  letterback marked &apos; Five days strong arrest.&apos;  After being hard at work from G a.m.  to G p.m., I was tied to the pole from 7 pan.,, during36 degrees of frost.&quot;  This is corroborated by several witnesses.  That this  treatment  was  deliberate and inspired  by higher authority  is evident from the  fact that  Sergt-major Gibb saysthey obtained a copy of  the orders from the guard, which stated&quot; that no  mercy was to  be shown to us; we were men who had,everyone of us, assisted in stopping the Kaiser&apos;s army from  goingto Paris;  and they  were to think of their comrades  who  werebeing  brutally treated in France.  Any soldier failing to carryout these orders was  to be severely punished.&quot;  The food  was bad.  It was deliberately so.  The guards gotthree-quarters of a loaf each day, the prisoners, doing hard  work,received one-sixth of a loaf.   The guards were given good, thicksou]),  the  prisoners,  soup &quot;  that you  could drink straight  off.&quot;To  such straits were the men reduced that it  is recorded  bymore  than  one witness  that the  men became so ravenous  thatthey would  eat anything.   &quot;  There  were,&quot;  says  one (Discoll,Norfolk Regiment), &quot; many unburied Russian bodies lying round the camp.    Some men were  so-  reduced that when they saw anybones  they would rush at them  and eat them like a dog.   It waspitiful to see men  reduced to such an animal stage.&quot;  Another,Sergt.-major Gibb, A.  and  S.,&quot;  I do not wish  to give detailsof the state  that some of us were reduced to in their craving for food or of what they  picked up to eat.&quot;  No parcels were allowedbefore April,  and  no  letters.   When  the  remnants  of thisunhappy company returned to Mitau, 20,000 parcels were foundstored.  Had they been forwarded suffering might  have  been avoided and lives saved.  The men were literally starved.   One man says he lost  4A stonein weight.   Many  died.  The result of this inhuman  treatment was what might  havebeen expected.  At the  end of April, .19.17, there were  77 menb ft in the camp out  of the 500  driven there in February.
  Of these, no  fewer than 47 were certified  by the doctor,  whoseems at last to have been  allowed some  authority as unfit toleave their bods.  Not less than 23 had died from exposure and starvation some.16 in the camp  the rest in hospital at Mitan,  besides those killedby the sentries or permanently injured by shell fire or frost bite.  It is not necessary for the present purpose to go into all theharrowing details of this appalling story.  The question is  whois responsible?  There can  be no doubt whatever that the suffering enduredby this unfortunate 500 were directly due to someone  in autho-rity in Berlin&quot;  The terms of the notice read  out to the prisoners and of the &quot;orders given to the guard are in exact accordance withthe terms of the Note  Verbale of the 24th January, 1917.  But,fortunately,  the name of some of the  actors  in this tragedy are known.  Captain Draudt, in his report in the  summer of 1916,says Landwehr Captain  Forster was  in  command of the wholeCommando of 2,000 and of No.  4 Company at Libau.  warrant officer Thies was in command of No.  3 Company at Wainoden,later at Taken; Warrant officer Mictke, of  No. 2 Company atMitau, and Lieutent Giesse, of No. 1 Company at Angerssee, and later at Latchen or Kelzien.  Two names are given  as the officers in command at  the campwhere the atrocities above described occurred.  Lt. Prahl of theReserve Artillery and  Lt. Krael of the 2nd Jager Regiment.  It is not at  present possible to say whether these two namesrefer to the same man. at the same  camp.  The place where themen were confined is  referred to as  Latcham,  Kalzman  andKalzien.   As far as I am able to make out, they are all the sameplace, for the camp seems to have been  in a village of Latcham orLatchen, near Kalzman.  The interpreter was  (( Logeman,&quot;  and from all accounts heseems to have been well  fitted to carry out the orders.  The  guard appears  to have  belonged  to  the 46 LandsturmRegiment, from Frankfort o/Oder.-  It seems to me that Lts. Prahl and/or Krael are immediatelyresponsible for what went on; Captain Forster,  if he was still in command during the whole time, and  further back there shouldbe discovered someone in the Kriegs Ministerinm who gave theorder  so  faithfully carried  out.   Whether this can  be  donedepends on the Treaty of Peace.  N.C.0s. specially mentioned by Oapt. Draudt as reliable :      Sergt. Andrews, W. Yorks.    C.P.O. Bacon, R.N.D.    Sergt.

                   MEMORANDUM III.    WORKING CONDITIONS IN GERMAN MINKS AND QUARRIES.  I have read the evidence in the following&apos; 15  cases:      Neanderthal  ...    .........   Stone Quarry.    Neubeckum............     ,,    Wulfrath    ............           ,,    Hagen       ............     ,,      ,-,    Elbingerode............    Borbeck      ............Coal Mine.    Augusta  Victoria   .........     ,,    Aplerbeck    ...    ...    ...     ...    Westenholt  ............    Beienrode    ............Salt Mine.

Lilneburg    ............     ,,    ,,    Gluckauf    ............Sarsted Salt Mine.  I have applied to each case the ordinary tests of  a criminallawyer:      1st. What was the offence  or offences against the laws and             usages of war ?    2nd. -If there was an offence, can the offender be  identified?    3rd. What was the  degree  of responsibility of the offender,             having regard to his position ?    4th. Was the offence committed on his  own initiative,  or             was he obeying orders, or carrying out a system?    5th.-What is the reliable and admissible  evidence available             in support of the charge ?    6th. What would be the probable defence to the charge?    7th. Could the alleged  offender  be  put on his trial with a             reasonable probability of conviction?  I do not think any  case should be put  forward for&apos; trial unlessall  these questions  can  be satisfactorily  answered.   It may beassumed that in every  case  coming before  the international tribunal, if  that mode  of trial is agreed upon, each case willbe not  only  well defended but  strenuously fought, and  as theobject in view is there-establishment of International Law, the putting forward of weak cases would have a very bad effect.  Dealing generally with all the cases there is ample evidence :      (1)  That the prisoners were  not humanely treated.    (2)  That the food supplied Avas  insufficient, especially for          men engaged in hard manual  labour.    (3)  That the  accommodation was in  many instances  very          bad.    (4)  That the sanitary arrangements  were  deplorable.    (5)  That  the  work  given to them  was  excessive,  having          regard to their health and capacity.    (6)  That the men were forced to  work under threats and by          being assaulted.    (7)  That the prisoners were beaten by sentries with impunity.    (8)  That the life was really a life of slavery,
   The question  then  arises  as to who  can be successfully  made responsible for this state of things?   It would be said by those in control of a quarry or mine that they  had no  responsibility with regard to  food,  as  they dis- tributed such food as they were supplied with, and  the  same answer  would be made with regard to clothing.   Sir Reginald  Acland,  who has an intimate knowledge of the facts, has pointed  out the difficulty with regard to any  charge as to food  and clothing; that they were not responsible for matters which they could not control; that the  questions of  food and clothing and work were governed by regulations and,  probably, that the Germans  were required to do the same kind of work.   As to the conduct of the sentries in making the prisoners work and driving  them to  their work  by force,  and striking  them while at their work; the answer would be  that they were carrying out orders; that the amount of work to be done was not decided by them; that the question as to whether the prisoners were fit for the  work was not  decided by them; that where  the prisoners were  treated  with exceptional severity  it was due to acts of insubordination  and attempts at escape.   Under the Hague Convention it is provided that prisoners of war shall be  subject to the laws, regulations and orders in  force in the Army of  the State  in the  power of which they are.  Any act of insubordination justifies the adoption towards them of such measures of severity  as may be necessary.  This  proposition is a very wide one.   What I venture to suggest is, that an attempt should be  made to formulate charges against those  responsible for the  system&apos; adopted in regard  to prisoners at these  various camps.   Dealing with these cases separately:                          Neanderthal.   There is only one  witness.   The complaint of a man who escaped and was re-captured.  Some  of his complaints were of a very trifling character.                         Neubeckum.   A witness in this case says that bitterness was  shown by the Germans (who had not  gone to  the front) because they  were hungry.   &apos;   Another  witness says:  The matter  of  food  was of  no  great importance to us as we were living on our  parcels, but we thought it  right to make the complaint as we knew that in doing so we were giving the  authorities a certain amount of trouble.   There is the case of a prisoner named Davis who  was smoking and having a dispute with his foreman, who kicked him.   Davis took up  a pick in a threatening manner  and was shot.   There was an inquiry and the camp leader was removed.                         Wulfrath.   At  this quarry work seems  to have  been excessive,  the  sani- tary conditions very bad,  the prisoners knocked about, disputes about working on  Sunday.   Principal   troubles arising  fromrefusal  to  work.   No  identification,  and  difficulty in fixingresponsibility.  Punishment for insubordination.
                           Ilagen.   Only two witnesses; very little evidence.   Witness knocked about  because be  refused  to  work.   No identity.   Carrying1 out order.                        Elbingerode.   The case in which the men worked were physically unfit.   A man  named   Sherwood  had  insufficient  clothing in  a very emaciated condition.   Number of other men, 18 or 19, in same condition.   Work excessive; knocked about  by sentries and  sergeants.   The cold of the place severe.   Want of food and warm clothing the cause of death of two men and illness of others.   Gefreitert  a  violent man.   With evidence of identity, this  appears to  me to be  a case which it would be well to elaborate.  The apparently very strong evidence is qualified by that of Corporal Roberts.  He speaks  of the cooking being  exceedingly well done,  and that  they were able  to buy useful articles  at reasonable prices.   This  case  should be  carefully  considered  when  additional information has been obtained.                          Borbeck.   This is  described as a Straf Commando, and  it is  said men maimed themselves to  get  away.  A  complaint is  made of a violent assault on a prisoner named Leak  for refusing to give information as to the escape of a friend.   He was struck with great violence and  the bones of his arm broken.  He was sub- sequently  tried for mutinous conduct.   In  connection  with  several complaints  about  these  different camps, trials  of some kind appear to have taken place so that the Germans will have  their own record.   This is  a case  in which careful  examination  of Leak would have to he made.               Augusta Victoria (Coal Mine).   Excessive work.   Sentries said it was a punishment  camp for them  as well  as for the prisoners.   Civilians complained  very much  of  the  amount o&apos;f  work they had to do.   Under Military Law; compelled to work.   Punishment for refusal;  for escape.   Work on Sunday.   Work at coke ovens.   Hunger  of civilians.   Yisits of doctor twice a day.   Stories of tricking the doctors sores on legs.  Coke under the arms.   Fights with civilians.  Yisits by neutrals.   Question as to whether two deaths wrere by accident.   Great number of witnesses; a good deal of hearsay.  Accommodation and sanitary conditions bad.  Great difficulty  of making definite charge,
                          Apletbeck.   In this case there is only one witness.   Frank Cannon he refused to work and thought lie was entitled to do so.  The dispute kept up for days.  The doctors said he was fit for work.  The  serious complaint was  that  sentries  dragged sick men out of beds to make them work.  That all nationalities were treated the same, but the question as to fitness to work was decided by the doctor.  This man says  the  accommodation and sanitary arrangements were good,   the washing  arrangements good, and we always got a bath when we came  up  from the pit. The food from  England came  in good condition.   Evidence may be available that the condition with regard  to baths,  etc., at the mines  was not  so bad.   This practice of striking men for not working  is one that prob- ably obtains in Germany.                    Westenholt  (Coal  Mine).   Ill-treatment.   Excessive  punishment.   Confined for  four  or, five days  in  hot cells.   Contrast  Armstrong&apos;s evidence  with &quot;Watson&apos;s,  who says no ill-effects.   It was probably a  punishment camp.   Complaints through  Netherland&apos;s  Minister.   Fully dealt with by Berlin.                          Beiemode.   It is complained at this  mine, work was excessive.  The name of the manager of the mine  is  given Herr Stark and the engi- iieer Schwartz, who are described as slave drivers.  It is stated that the German  civilians did  work  of a far lighter character. The witness,  Andrew  Haily Jones,  deals with the matter  in great detail.  The principal complaint  is overwork  and being kept too long hours in the mine to complete work required.   The men suffered  from  sores, but the German civilians were affected in the same way.   Complaint,  also, that the  doctor was unskilful or very brutal with his lancet.   The  punishments   appear  to  have  been  very  excessive for trifling  offences, -and the sergeant  and sentries thrashed the prisoners with great violence.   The sanitation was also said to be  very bad.   Men working in salt mines require careful  medical attention.                        Heygendorf.  There  are three  statements in this  case Donald MacPherson,H. M. Caffery and W.,G. Allen.  MacPherson was there for nearly  two years.   His statementamounts to this: That he  was unwilling to work there  at  all,and refused, but was forced to work; that when  he said he  wasill, a doctor said he was shamming.
   M. Caffery, who is by profession  a mine surveyor, criticising the  mine,  described it as  unnecessarily unhealthy because  the ventilation could be improved, and  criticises the medical  treat- ment.   Corporal Allen says the  treatment was good,  the accommoda- tion comparatively good&apos;; parcels of food came regularly and that men who were genuinely sick did not have  to work.                          Grasleben.   A, Cook, 4th  Dragoon  Guards,  speaks  of a party of  new prisoners, weak from  want of food, being unable  to complete their tasks and forced to work extra  shifts.  Complaints of place being  overcrowded,  insufficient  ventilation  and bad  sanitary arrangements.  Saw no cases of men being  brutally used and knocked about. -   Case of Meich,  being struck by sentry for refusing to work, returned the blow, then being brutally  beaten.  Complaints  of medical attendance.   Meich  very badly treated, made to work when he was unfit.   Case of defence would be that his ill-treatment followed on his having struck  a German sentry, for which he was tried by court- martial and sentenced&apos;.   Another Witness says the sentries used the butts of their rifles, and this treatment was usually resorted to for all offences instead of arrest.   Prisoners kept  too many hours in mine.  Parcels,, however, arrived  regularly.   This is  a case which was the subject of a complaint through the Netherlands Legation, and the denial by Berlin of all ground of complaint is most sweeping.   The charges made are denied categorically.   It is therefore a case which  should be inquired into when further material  is available.   Thomas Kelly says that the name of this Commando was known to be very bad.   That it was  known as a Straf Commando.   That the work was excessive.   This witness seems to have exercised  his ingenuity to  give  as much trouble as he could by throwing the machines out 0? gear. He says if a man  was not  working properly he  would be struck by the guards, who might  give him one or two severe blows on the head, shoulders or anywhere.  He speaks of Russian prisoners frying to escape being  fired at, and treated with great violence. The same kind of thing with a Frenchman who tried to escape.   There is another case, the particulars of which  it is difficult to arrive at, of a  private named Burns being  terribly ill-treated for refusing to work.   There are complaints of men having to work for sixteen hours in consequence of being unable to complete the work in one shift,and being knocked about by the sentries.  Corporal Jenkins described the conditions as  being very -bad,the health of the men bad from want of food and overwork.
    He alleged that the N.C.Os. had dogs which they set on the  prisoners.    This  was positively denied by the German  authorities.                           Glucltanf,    The complaint here from William Fair is that the Commandant and  Second in Command treated  the  prisoners,  he said,  mur- derously.    The violence he complains of was knocking about of British prisoners who refused to go down the mine on the first day.    This refusal continued  for several days until the sentries, with assistance of a  number of civilian workmen, forced  them to go down.   One youth, who is said  not to have been in his right mind, was especially knocked about.   The sanitary  conditions were very bad.   Prisoners  were knocked about because two of the others had tried to escape.  The Russian prisoners  appear  to have  been treated much worse.                          Luneburg.        *   In this case I do not find a statement from  any prisoner, but the condition of things seems to have been the subject of com- plaint through the Netherlands Legation.  The complaint was apparently with regard to British prisoners working  in too great heat.&quot;   The answer from Berlin was that the German labourers were as little the worse from it as the British prisoners.   That with  regard to the complaint of over-crowding the  place was sufficiently ventilated by four windows and four ventilators and two  doors.  And it is said  the  British prisoners had made no complaint of housing or work to the inspection officer.   It seems to have been reported that prisoners had sought to escape work by feigming sickness.   On the facts disclosed in these case I  think  that the charges should&apos;be made against those responsible for the treatment of the prisoners generally in these mines and quarries, and that would ie against the German Staff.  Mr. Justice Younger&apos;s Memorandum seems to me also to point o that conclusion.  On going through the Dutch reports on  the conditions  in the vabove mines with Sir Reginald Aoland, I find that in five  of thecases there are no reports; in three cases there are good reports;in three  cases there are - favourable  reports,  and in.  four  casesunfavourable reports, but on  rather unimportant  matters.   Iunderstand that the Dutch representatives-were educated and responsible men.                                       .  In some  cases the conduct of the  Commandant was inquired.into, and in the case of Bokel and Neubeckum the Commandantswere got rid of,  and one  of thern  punished, as the  result  of complaints,
   The  persons controlling  a  working  camp,  I  understand, are;           1st.  The Kommandofuhrer, or Commandant.         2nd. Feldwebel, or Sergeant.         3rd.  Gefreiter, or Corporal.         4th. Postern,  or  Sentries.         5th. Steiger, or Foreman.   It would be important to know the extent of the authority of the Commandant with regard to punishment; either in respect of work,  attempts to escape, or insubordination.   This  information would be important on the question of the degree of responsibility of individuals.   As I have suggested above, the best kind of charge to formulate would be one against the system adopted, if the identity of those responsible for the  system can be ascertained.   On such a  charge as that,  the  whole of the evidence,  relating to all the different mines  and quarries, could  be given.   Additional evidence will probably be  forthcoming with  regard to all the cases, as the result of the prisoners who are now coming home making statements.   Except in a few cases, there would  probably be considerable difficulty in making a case in respect  of the conduct of individuals at one particular mine.   Further investigation is clearly desirable with regard to  several of these:      Elbingerode, Augusta Victoria,  Beienrode, and Luneburg.   There  is  enough material disclosed  in  the  evidence  already taken to justify a general charge, if it  could be decided against whom  the charge should be made that is  to say, against which members of the General Staff.   (When the War  broke out, Germany  was under Military Lawand, I am  inclined  to think  from what I  have  read,  underMartial Law.  (This is not clear and probably  not the. case).)  The  form of the general charge would be something on theselines:    That at the following prisoners&apos; camps  (setting out then the names of the  Stonequarries, Coalmines and Saltmines selected):     . 1. the British prisoners were not humanely treated;    2. the work  that they were required  to  do was  excessive,          having regard to their condition and capacity;    3.  British prisoners were treated with  cruelty and subjected          to acts  of violence  by those in control  of the said          camps;                  &apos;    4.  the accommodation  provided was  insiifficient and  im-          proper, and the treatment they were subjected  to and          the conditions under which they were obliged  to live          were prejudicial to health. &apos; On the question of responsibility for the system,  it  will be important to  obtain copies of the regulations in force with  regardto work,  punishment and so on,  and then to ascertain the origin of these regulations.
                    MEMORANDUM IV.    BRITISH PRISONERS BEHIND THE GERMAN LINES ON THE                      WESTERN FRONT.  On the  7th February,  19.17,  a Note Verbale,  dated the 24thJanuary, 1917 (Cd. 8988, p. 12),  was received from the GermanGovernment  in which  it was stated that German  prisoners inFrance were detained behind the fighting line, that they suffered from  inadequate  food  and defective accommodation,  that theywere subjected to hard work  and irregularities in the matter of&apos;their mails, and  that some of them had been exposed to Germanshell  fire,  with  the result^  that several  bad been  killed  and wounded.   It alleged that no  British prisoners had been detained in the French and Belgian territory occupied by the  Germans forany considerable time,  and that,  except hospital cases, the onlyBritish prisoners of  war  then kept outside Germany were thosewho  had been sent,  by way of reprisals, to  occupied Russian.territory.   The Note Verbale went on to  say that unless  by the7th February an assurance  was received  that prisoners  behind the British Front  would  be immediately removed to  a distance of 30 kilometers behind the firing-line and provided there withaccommodation in accordance with the requirements of the seasonand hygienic needs,  and  that in  respect of postal arrangementsllrey would be placed on the same footing as prisoners in Ger-inany, a number of British prisoners would  be transferred  fromcamps in  Germany to  the  Western Front, where in  respect ofemployment,  accommodation,  food and the question of mails theywould be treated in a manner corresponding to the practice of theBritish Military Authorities, and  that British prisoners  falling into  German hands on the Western  Front would, in future bekept in similar conditions within  the sphere  of operations.  The British Government replied on the 8th February, pointing out that the  complaints had not any foundation, and that onlyone man had been wounded  by a shell which  must have  beentired at an exceptionally long range (Cd. 8988, p. 13).   As appears from  Cd.  8988  (pp. 5  and  23)  an agreement was  concludedbetween the  two  Governments  at the end of April, .19.17,  that prisoners of war should not be employed  within 30 kilometresof the firing  lines.&quot;   The  Germans acted up to their threats; butit seems that long before they thought fit to threaten reprisalsthey were acting in a manner similar to that which followed thesethreats.    The Government  Committee and the Foreign  Office(Cd. 8988)  state that the  inhuman methods of the Germans  werein force at least as early as July or August, 19.16.  The evidence which I have read does not go back  as far as this; but,  on theevidence which I have seen, it is plain that British prisoners werebeing ill-treated  in December,  19.16, at Ronssoy (2.191) and atVendhuile (2.19.1 and 2033),  and at Cambrai in November,  1916(2033).  It will be advisable to obtain further evidence in respectof the latter half of  1916.  In the early part of 1917 the  system was in full operation.  It is  plain that it was carried on underthe. direct  orders of the responsible  authorities.  Not only is
 there the threat of reprisals in the Note Verbale to which I have referred,  but the  prisoners were constantly told that they were to be starved, ill-treated and over-worked by way of reprisals.   In the Government  (Jommittee&apos;s  Report (Cd.  8988, p.  8) is set out a &quot; Notice of Respite to German Prisoners &quot; (see  1055), which was  handed to  a  British N.C.O.  to be  read  out  to,the British prisoners  at Lille on the 15th April,  1917,  and  which stated that all  British prisoners  were in future to  be kept  as &quot;prisoners  of respite,&quot; very  short of food,  bad  lodging, bad lighting,  no beds  and hard work beside the German guns,  under heavy shell fire.  No pay, no soap  for washing or shaving, no towels, or boots, etc.   At  Port Macdonald (also called Mons en Barocul)  a  similar notice  was read  io the prisoners  on the 7th May, 1917  (1833).  This notice stated that the  German protest against the  working of German prisoners  within range of gun- fire  had  not  received attention,  and   that  for  this  reason instructions had been received from the German Authorities that the British  prisoners should be made to work under British fire, and  that  the conditions should be  made  exceedingly  hard for them.   Statements of this kind were made to the British prisoners at Fort Macdonald on  other occasions, in April and May, 1917 (2282 and 2330), and also at various other places,  e.g., Sanchy- Lestree in March,  .19.17  (764), Lille Citadel in April, 1917  (780), Cambrai in  January, 1917 (782), Brebieres, April to  July,  1917 (1054),  Meurchin,  May,  1917 (1833), Le Porer in  June 1917 (1840),  Denain in  May, 1917  (2521).  The camp at Le  Porer is said to have been started as a measureof retaliation in  January, 1917 (1840),  and  the witness who describes it  states that,  as a reprisal, the prisoners, while he was there from June 24th to August 24th, 1917, were not allowed toreceive  any parcels, and that when he  returned- to  Le  Porertowards  the end of November, 1917, he and  his companions were told  that as the English had moved the German prisoners back from the front line they would be  allowed to have theirparcels.   There cannot be a doubt  that  the  German  higher command was  directly responsible   for  the gross inhumanitywhich  the British  prisoners suffered in 1917, and I gather thatthere is evidence to implicate  them in connection with the treat-ment of British prisoners  in  1916 reported in  Cd. 8988.  Butthe treatment to which  I will refer later did not end in 1917.  In the  spring of 1918  the  German Higher  Command  came,Or professed  to  come, to  the  conclusion that the. british authorities  were  keeping  German  prisoners  working  in  their front lines,   and  on  this  ground renewed,  or  continued, themaltreatment of British prisoners.  At Fort Macdonald in  april and May,  1918 (2173), at Provin in April,  1918 (1773), at Salomein April,  1918 (1774), the British prisoners were told that theywere suffering by way of reprisals on this.ground; in June,  1918,at Aguilcourt (2181), they were informed  that they  were  to bekept there for 13 weeks,  because the French had kept the german prisoners at  the back of their lines for 13 weeks,  while  at Proiivy,in April, 1918, a German General is said to have refused a request
 for more  food  on the ground that the British  prisoners were being  starved,  because  (lie  British  Navy  was starving  the Germans  (1764). Heads  of Complaint.    /he  complaints in  the evidence may roughly be divided into the following heads:       (1) Very bad  accommodation.     (2) Very bad  sanitation.     (3) Underfeeding.     (4) Overwork.     (6) Brutality.     (6) Compulsory work on war material.     (7) Exposure  to shell-fire.   There is a mass of evidence in support of  these  complaints. The most  flagrant instance of the first two, and  to some  extent of the  third, is, on the present evidence, Fort Macdonald.  In the spring, .1917, there were a number of British prisoners con- fined at this  place.  A witness (1833) states  that when he was there,  for  ten  days,  there  were from .10.1 to 135  men  in  an underground cell  which  was  only  ventilated by one window; the only sanitary provision was a tub in the cell itself.  During his stay there  he was allowed  to  wash  twice.  The prisoners were not allowed out of the cell before the seventh  day.  The diet consisted of one-sixth of a  loaf for each man,  a drink of coffee  substitute at 7 a.m., thin soup  of mangelworzel and a little barley at  12 a.m. and again  at 6  p.in.   The men by the seventh day were  so weak  from confinement and want of food that they  staggered as  they walked, and three  collapsed and were removed in an ambulance.  Another (2282), who was at the Fort, somewhat earlier for ten days,  states that 180 of them were in a cell of 25 feet by .15 feet, which had one  window 6 feet by 4  feet;  nobody  was allowed  out  to wash; for latrines there was a  barrel in the cell, which was cleaned out once every four days; the cell was full of vermin; each prisoner had one  slice of bread, soup once a day and coffee once a day.  Another witness (2330), who was at  the  Fort  for three days towards the  end  of April, 19.17, says that there  were from 120 to  130 prisoners in  a cell 40 feet by .15 feet on the first  floor;  there was no  water and  no means of washing; the sanitary arrangements consisted of large tubs, which  were used for defecating and urinating; they were never emptied or removed while  he  was there, and overflowed on to the floors of the cell.  He comments on the offensiveness of the stench.  Rations consisted of a 3 lb. black  loaf  for every ten men; at 12 a.m.  some thin vegetable soup and  at 6  p.m. acorn coffee.  The men were so enfeebled that  at the next place to which they went 26 out of a working party broke down.   Sergeant Humphries, who was at the Fort from the 25th  April to the end  of June, 1917 (?), states that there were 350 men in a room  18 feet by 40 feet, which was filthy and full of lice. &apos; He.also refers.to the tub  for sanitary purposes, which in his  timeappears to  have  been emptied twice  a day, but it overflowed  at night on to the floor,  where the men had to  sleep.  The  place
 was so  hot that the men could  not  wear their clothes.   He describes the men as gasping for water and giving anything they had for  a  mouthful, while the guards, he says, laughed and jeered at the men  crying for water.  They were only allowed a quarter of  a loaf, what he describes as poisonous coffee, and  a drop of barley water or &quot; saurcraw.&quot;  The men, he states, were beaten and  kicked  for not moving quickly when they emerged from  this prison.   Witness (2361) is shorter,  but to a similar effect. - In  .19.18 the German system  at the Fort had not diminished in severity.  Sergeant Crosbie, who was there from .17th April to 13th  May,  says  there were 280,  many  of them Portuguese, in a room  50  feet by  20 feet,  It was terribly hot,  as there was only one window, and the men stripped naked in their attempt to keep cool.  The  sanitation was the same as in  1917.   For the first three  weeks, he says, they got  no water and no coffee.   The men were only allowed out five minutes each clay to draw their rations, everyone was lousey&apos; and exhausted, and the &quot;men often fainted when  they got into the air.  In August and September the con- ditions seem  to have been much  the same (2534).  The men are said to  have been then in a  very bad condition, covered with sores,  and suffering from dysentery, some of  them having been confined there since April.  The Sergeant in Charge of parade is stated to have knocked the prisoners about if they were excused from  duty  by the Red Cross sergeant.   It  seems  (2533 and2534)  that,  while the British were  locked up in this cell, a largeparty  of Italians was allowed considerable freedom and was much better treated.   The rations  at this time appear to have been  apint of coffee for breakfast,  1.1.30 a.m. half bowl of soup made out of horse  beans, and  at 4.30 tea made of beech  leaves anda quarter of a loaf of black bread, with occasionally a little jam orfat-about 2 lbs. between 40 men.   The Germans were receivingat this time, according to the witness (2533), two loaves each forevery  five days, coffee for breakfast, soup for dinner and supper,and some meat.   Another witness  (2547) speaks of  the  period22nd May to 15th July, when there were 300 prisoners in what he calls the  dungeon,  gives the  same account  of the sanitaryarrangements, describes the vermin as awful, and says that men were only allowed out at .11.30 a.m. to draw their rations.  Thisman was wounded, but his wound was never dressed while he was at  the Fort,  and he states that he never saw or heard of anywound being dressed while he was there.  There were no washingarrangements and no bed clothes; the men lay on wooden boardslike the bunks of a ship.  This witness refers  to an  interpreter who used to knock the men  about  and  who stated  that his  wife and children were  in  London.  One man died  in consequenceof his having been kicked by the Sergeant while he was ill andenfeebled by  this treatment.   In April and May, .1918,  PrivateBeaton was  at this Fort for six weeks, when there were 300 or400 men in the room.   These men got so  lousey that they had to &quot;lie  bare to  get  peace for a time.&quot;   The weather  was veryhot and the men were locked  in;  they  were refused  water andfainted  from the heat and  exhaustion.  About  the  same time
Private Stark was there for about six weeks.  For the first threeweeks be says that  they had no drink of any kind; that therewere  about 230 prisoners in what  he describes as  &quot; an evilsmelling, verminous cell.&quot;  They were allowed out once a day to draw their rations, which, according to him, consisted of poorstew and   lb. loaf.  He, too, refers to  the  men sitting-  aboutstark  naked in consequence of the stifling  heat.  According  tohim, one or two men died there, and he himself could not&apos; walkout to get his rations without help.  These acco\mts may be, andprobably are, in some degree exaggerated.  It would be almost impossible  for  men  who had  passed through such a purgatorynot to exaggerate.   Making all allowances,  it appears to  me thatFort  Macdonald is  a case of shocking barbarity, and  that allpersons responsible  for the inhuman  system which  prevailedthere  ought to be  punished.   These  would  include  the Com-mandant of the Fort, the Commander of Lille if the Commandantof the Fort was his subordinate, the local army Commander, and,as in  the case of the Eastern  Front, the Minister of War.   Inthe case of  Fort Macdonald the men complained of underfeeding;as one of the witnesses said, &quot; we had just  enough to live  on  &apos;&apos;;but in Fort Macdonald the  prisoners had not to work,  and the acute  complaints of starvation arise in  the  numerous cases  inwhich the prisoners  were compelled to spend long hours in hardwork.Working Camps.  In many of these camps the prisoners were exposed  to  shell-fire, for instance Provin and Salome, where 14 men were wounded((1773), Meurchin  (1833), Sailly (2002 to 2005, and  PrivateBeaton), Flers (2282);  they were compelled to  work  on warmaterial, for instance, Sailly, where prisoners had to carry casesof shell from the dump up to the line (Private Beaton) and hadto load shells and   dig ammunition pits  (2002-4); Meurchin,where the prisoners  had to carry shells to the German trenchesor support lines (.1833) and dig trenches or dug-outs in the supportlines; Cantin, where they had to load ammunition and other warmaterial (2992-4); Flers,  where they had  to dig gun  emplace-ments for field guns, and were punished because they refused  tocarry  up ammunition from a dump (2282); Le Porer, where theyhad to break up old iron for  use as shrapnel (1840); Peronne,where they unloaded shell trains into lorries for the lines (2341,2335); Ramecourt,  where they carried and loaded  ammunition(2298) and  had to clear munition trains, which had been bombed,because the Germans refused  to  do  this dangerous  work, and37 casualties ensued  in one day (2530); Chaudardes, where theywere  set to work to load ammunition on  railway  trucks, andwere kept  at this  work by  two officers with revolvers  (2300);Loos,  civil prison, where they worked  at shell dumps (PrivateBeaton).  In all these cases the Germans were acting unlawfully.Major Gattie has supplied the Sub-Committee with the informa-tion that  the  British War  Office gave strict instructions that german prisoners were not to be employed on work of this kind.  There is  much evidence of the rough and brutal treatment  ofthe prisoners  by their  guards,  and sometimes by  officers,  for
example, Vendhuile, where the prisoners were beaten  with riflebutts  as an inducement  to  work (2038); Le Porer,  where the prisoners are said to have been knocked down by the guards onthe slightest pretext (1840); CanUn, where the guards are saidto have kicked  the  prisoners and beaten them  with  sticks  andrifle butts  (2002-4); Sailly,  where the some things  happened(2002-5); fillers, where  a Prussian Guard (56  Regt.  0.1.1)  wasguilty* of similar conduct (2.175); Ecoust, where  the sentries  andan  officer or under-officer  in command of the camp, and  asergeant-major under of  him, both of the  56 Regt. VII.,  areaccused of  the  brutal  use  of  rifle  butts  and sticks  (2.175);liethel, where men  who lagged or fell down from exhaustion orillness were kicked or beaten (2206); Maretz, where a man  was shot dead by a guard because he stooped down to pick up a packetof cigarettes, and where  two men who attempted to escape hadto stand to attention for about 12 hours a day for a fortnight andwere so beaten  by  the Commandant  and Feldwebel  that theyhad to go into hospital (2283 and 2290); Ramecourt, where themen who were lying on the ground from exhaustion were kickedand beaten  to  make them resume  work (2298-2300),  and theguards beat the men with sticks (2351), and men AVIIO fell down from exhaustion on the march were prodded with rifle butts andkicked (2530);  Amifontaine, where the guards often kicked andbeat the prisoners (2298-2300);  Peronne,  where the same kindof thing happened, and. one man was knocked senseless and diedthree  days after; complaint was made unavailingly to the officers(2335-2341); Brie,  where men are said to  have been knockedabout  because  they  were  too  feeble  to  work  hard  (2335);Bazancourt, where  the guards&apos; treatment is  said to have beenbrutal,  and no satisfaction  could  be  obtained from  the Com-maiidant (2353 and 2535); Douai, where  the men ore said to havebeen beaten with sticks  and rifle butts (2361);  Denarii-, wherethe men are said to have been punished if they tried to washand were driven to  work  with sticks and rifle butts (2621).  In  these cases, again,  there is probably  some exaggeration,and much of this ill-treatment may be due to the way in which german N.C.Os. habitually dealt with  their own men;  but thegravamen of the charge,  I think, in nearly all  the cases is thatthe men were driven to work when from underfeeding and illnessthey were quite unfit to work, and were roughly  and brutallytreated&apos; in consequence of their  inability; and  the  evidence onthis head seems to  me to be useful  in the main as accentuatingthe charge that they were compelled to work, when  under the elementary principles of  humanity no such demand should havebeen made upon them.   In  many cases  the  accommodation for  the prisoners  wasdecidedly bad;  and in some cases  the  sanitation was  execrable,for instance, at Le Porer (June to August, 1917)  150 prisoners were  placed in  a machine shop,  50  feet by 30 feet, with a sunktub in  the  room for all sanitary  purposes.  During the  firstmonth it does not seem to have been emptied more than once, andas the windows were all boarded up,  and the tub overflowed onto the floor, the place &quot; stank horribly.&quot;  After the first month
wo large bowls were substituted, but as these were not regularlyemptied &quot; the stench was horrible.&quot;  Taking this in conjunctionwith the insufficient food, it is not surprising^ to  hear  that manyof the  men  suffered  from boils and dysentery  (1840).   AtVendhuile the men were lodged in temporary wooden  buildings,with no blankets, and the men in the top tier of beds were coveredwith hoar  frost in  the winter of 1916-17.   A complaint is madeof the  smell from  a  hole in the ground, which  was the latrine.Here, too,  most of the men suffered from dysentery; the men werefull  of vermin, and about 18 died.  In this, as in other cases,the prisoners&apos; boots were, taken   away (2.191 and 2033).   AtVillers  (March,  19.18)  there were  1,000 prisoners, and  one hutwhich  held .100, the rest sleeping  in holes  in the ground.   Theplace was swarming with vermin, there were no sanitary arrange-ments and no means of washing (2175).  At Ecou.it (April, 1918)similar conditions prevailed (2.175). At Bazancourt 400 prisoners were put into  huts; very overcrowded;  for latrines there  was along hole in the ground,  which &quot; got  into a terrible state.....Millions of  flies and  a  terrible  stench.&quot;   The camp becamefilthy  and verminous,  dysentery  was  rife,  and  there were fivedeaths  from it in three months (2353 and  2537).  At Meurchin(May and June, 1917)  the prisoners were placed in stables, andslept on the  stone  floors  without any  covering.   At  Ronssoy(December, 19.16), a machine factory, men slept in tiers,  loweston the  stones;  no mattresses  or blankets  and bitterly cold (2191).At Flers (May-June, 1917) 200 were in the church; slept on thestone floors  without straw;  washing  not  allowed (2282).    AtRamecourt (May-June, 19.18) there were  2,000 prisoners  whohad no accommodation; slept on the ground without any covering,with no washing or sanitary arrangements (2298-2300,  2340,2351,  2-530).*   At  Craonne  (June,   .1918)  there were  1,000prisoners  in  conditions similar  to those  at  Ramecourt  (2298-2300).   At Peronne and  Brie (April  to August, 1918) the  menwere shockingly overcrowded in  huts  (2335-2341).   At  Douai(April-May,- .1917) 280 were in half completed house;  there were no baths and the men  lay on concrete floors, soaked to the skin.They were covered with sores from lice (2361).   Denain (May to july, 1917) was a wire cage with no shelter or blankets,  washingbeing prohibited (2521).  The  insufficiency of accommodation in the spring of 1918 may,in part, be accounted for by the large captures then effected, but some of the above complaints relate  to an earlier period; andthe impression left on  my mind is that the Germans  were quiteindifferent on the  subject of the accommodation or health  oftheir prisoners behind  the lines on the  Western Front.   In anycase,  the  badness of  the  accommodation,  which  must have operated  on the  health  of the  prisoners,  rendered  it  moreinexcusable to work them hard on insufficient food.  It is, I think, necessary to  consider  complaints  of  under-feeding and ovenvork together, for what might be just sufficientfood without work would be totally insufficient  with  work,  and,  * (2530) this witness speaks well of the Commandant, a Colonel, but says that the N.O.O&apos;s. did what they pleased,        0
on ii view of the evidence,  I think it is clear that the sufferingsof the British prisoners were due to hard work without adequatesustenance  in  bad  and  insanitary  surroundings.   The  foodallowed in the camps appears to have been more than that whichwas given to prisoners at Fort Macdonald and Lille, where theyhad  not to  work; and  if, as  one  of  the  witnesses (SergeantHumphries) said,  the food  there was just enough  to live on, thelarger  amount  allowed  in the camps  might  not have  beenglaringly insufficient but  for the fact that prisoners were exposed to hard  work  for long hours.   The curtailment of rations to theminimum in  .19.17 at least was deliberate.  At  Lille and  FortMacdonald the  prisoners were  told that they were going to bestarved  (780  and  1055 and 1833).   At the risk  of repetition Irecall the  ration  at Lille and Fort  Macdonald.   At  Lille,Sergeant Humphries says, the ration was a quarter loaf of bread,barley and coffee substitutes,  &quot; just enough  to keep us living&quot;;and he  seems to have had a  similar ration at Fort Macdonald.Another prisoner states that the ration at  Fort Macdonald con-sisted of one loaf  for every six  men, a drink of coffee substituteat 7 a,ni., a thin soup of mangold wurzel at 12 a.m. and 6 p.in.(2173).   Another  says  that the food consisted of  one slice of bread,  soup once a  day,  and  coffee  once  a day (2282); whileanother says that rations at the Fort consisted of  one 3 lb. blackloaf for every ten men, thin vegetable soup at 12 a.m., and acorncoffee at 6 p.rn. (2361).  On this it is difficult to come to a definite conclusion what the ration at the Fort was;  but,  from  the accounts of  the  men&apos;shunger  and the previous  threats of  starvation, I  think there canbe little doubt that the amount of food allowed at the Fort waspunitively  small..   One  witness (2583) compares  the  Germanration  and  the British  prisoners  ration  at Lille  and  FortMacdonald in August and September, .1918.   A German got twoloaves for five  days, i.e., two-fifths of  a loaf a  day, coffee forbreakfast, soup for  dinner and supper, and  some  meat, whilethe prisoner had a quarter of a loaf a day, i.e.,  one loaf and a quarter  for five days, a pint of  coffee for breakfast,  half bowl of horse-bean soup at 1.1.30 a.m.,  and beech-leaf tea at  4.30 p.m.,while occasionally they had about 2 lbs. of jam  or fat between40 men.  He observes  that  400 Italian  prisoners  were  be ingtreated  all right.  In the camps it  is difficult  to ascertain  what the prisoner&apos;sration was.  If the witnesses are accurate, it would  seem to havevaried  in different  camps.  For instance,  the bread  ration atVendhuile (January, .1917) is  said to have been half a pound(2033);  at Villers and Ecoust (Spring, 19.18) a quarter of  a loaf(2175);  at  Flers  (June,   1917)  one slice  of  bread (2282);  atRamecouft (June,  1918)  a small slice of bread  (2298-2300), or one-third of a small  loaf (2340), or  May to August, 1918  f lb.black bread (2530); at  Craonne (June, 1918) a  slice of bread(2298-2300);  at Peronne (May to  August, 1918)  one-third of aloaf  (2335-2336).  (NOTE.-According to Cd. 8988, a quarter loaf is about I lb.)
   One  witness, a  N.C.O.  (2353), makes  a comparison  of  the prisoner&apos;s ration with the German ration at BazancouH (June to September, 1918).   The  prisoner  had one  pint of barley stew, one slice of bread (400  grammes), and substitute coffee, while the German soldier had the barley stew &quot; with probably a little meat in it,&quot; the substitute  coffee, and  700 grammes of  bread.  This would indicate that the German  guard had  considerably more food than  the  prisoners.   Whatever the actual ration  was,  the evidence is overwhelming  that it  was quite insufficient for men who had to do eight or nine, and sometimes more, hours&apos; hard work  a day.   The  evidence contains  constant references  to  the misery which the prisoners suffered from the combined effects of starvation  and  exhaustion; for instance, they  were  glad to pick up nettles, potato peelings, and dandelions  (Amifontaines, July, 1918 (2298-2300); at Cantin and Sailly (April and May,  1918). &quot; They were like  wild animals  with  hunger and scrambled  for any piece of food which might be lying about &quot; (2002-4).  They were punished  for accepting gifts of food  from civilians, and civilians were prevented from supplying food to them, and were punished, and  even fired  at, if they tried to  supplement  the prisoners&apos; ration.   (See,  for instance, Meurchin (1833), Denain (2521 and Private Beaton); see also instances given in Cd.  8988). There are constant complaints that the men were forced to work when,  in their condition of  weakness,  it was  sheer  cruelty  to expect it.  No parcels reached these men who were  working behind the lines on the Western  Front, and  it was therefore impossible  for  them to supplement their insufficient  rations  in this way.   Probably, as  is suggested  by the Government Com- mittee  Report (Cd. 8988), this was due to defects in organisation; but,  if the witness (1840)  is correct,  there is  evidence that  at Le Porer prisoners&apos;  parcels were  deliberately withheld.  This, however, is the  only witness who speaks of the condition of  affairs at Le Porer, and I think it would  be  well that further enquiries should be made with reference to  this place.   But there  is one thing which establishes, I  think, beyond question the charge of compulsory overworking  on  insufficient food,  and that  is  the physical results.  The  men who, when they  were captured, musthave been in  hard condition, lost weight and became emaciated;they became, in large  numbers of cases, covered with boils andsores, dysentery, was rampant, and large numbers of the mensuffered from swelled legs  and feet (in the evidence  sometimescalled  dropsy).   These complaints seem to have been  commonthroughout the camps.   Two  British  prisoners who acted  asorderlies  in  the   following  German  field  hospitals,  Croix Molyneux,  61st Clearing  Station, Ham, Clearing  Station  atChaulnes, and  Hattencourt, state that in May and June, 1918,there was a constant stream of  sick British prisoners from  theworking camps  behind the line, that they  were in a very badstate of dirt and starvation, suffering from dysentery, and havingswollen feet and legs as  though suffering from dropsy, so thatthey could not get boots on  and had to slit their trousers up, andthat as many as 20  or 30 such cases had sometimes come in  inone day  (2096-7);  and (as appears from Cd.  8988)  a  German
 professor in  charge  of a ward in  a  German hospital in France told a wounded British officer, who asked why British  and other prisoners who reached the hospital were  so emaciated,  that they came from working camps behind  the lines,  where the conditions were so frightful that he was shocked at them,  the men being overworked,  under shell-fire,  very much underfed, with little clothing  and in  a  filthy  condition.  The  evidence,  I  think, establishes beyond doubt (.1)  That  the  prisoners received con- siderably  less food  than  the  guards; (2)  that they  were compelled to work   hard  for eight or  nine,  and  sometimes considerably  more, hours a day;  (8) that the food  which they received was  totally  inadequate to the labour which was exacted from them; and (4) that disastrous effects on their health resulted. Assuming that the Germans were able to establish that they had not  sufficient supplies&quot; to enable  them  to  feed  their  prisoners better, the answer appears to me to*be that,  as they were  bound to treat their prisoners humanely,  they ought not to have broken them down by work which could only be  required from men who were both better  fed  and in better sanitary conditions; and in ibis connection it must be remembered  that the evidence  shows that the men  were forced to work although  they were suffering from the complaints which I have  mentioned,  and were only sent to the hospitals  when they dropped,  absolutely worn  out. Conclusions as to Working Camps.  1. The Commandants of the camps where British  prisoners were forced to work under shell fire, or to  dig trenches or gun pits, or to handle munitions of war,  should,  I think, be brought to trial,  or at any rate some  of them by way of example.  In addition  to  the  camps of  this  description mentioned above, Cd. 8988 indicates evidence, most of which appears to be hearsay,as to other camps, and I suggest that further evidence  on these lines should be sought, particularly with reference to the  camps in the neighbourhood of Cambrai and Lille, and Camp E.K. 5.  2. The system of inhumanity (rough treatment, under-feeding,over-work, even when sick) prevailed throughout these Camps onthe Western Front, and was obviously, in the main, the result ofsuperior orders.   I doubt whether it would be advisable to arraignall  the  Commandants; one  of them  at  least  is  praised in theevidence.   It  might be considered whether  some  selected  Com- commandants should  be  brought to trial, by way of  example; but those who were really responsible  for this system  should be triedand  punished^  Who these persons were  must be considered.  I  may  add  that the evidence in connection with some of the camps is at present very far from  complete.   There seems to be only one witness  as to Le Porer.   I  have seen very little or nofirst hand evidence  as  to  working  camps  at  Cambrai,  Lille,Ervillers, Marquion,  Tournai,  Camp E.K. 5, all referred  to inCd. 8988.                                     &apos;   &apos;   &apos;    &quot;
                     MEMORANDUM V.                THE GERMAN MILITARY SYSTEM.   .1.  The German Military System.-&apos; he general military system of the German Army falls broadly under  three headings, which are kept quite separate:       Appointments, under the Chief of the Military Cabinet,     Administration,  under the  Minister of War.     General Staff,  under the  Chief of the General Staff.   The three ofticers* above mentioned are the highest  military authorities  and act as&apos;personal  advisers to  the Emperor, who  is the supreme head of the Army.   2.  The Military  Cabinet  (Militar-Tvabinett)  issues the Official Gazette and Cabinet  Orders, and controls all appointments, pro- motions, transfers,  exchanges, retirements, honours and rewards, except for the posting of General Staff officers.   The Chief of the Military  Cabinet is senior personal  aide-de- camp and military secretary to the  Emperor, and is, practically, his ear and mouthpiece.   8. Ministry  of War (Kriegs-Ministerium). Each of the four Sovereign States of the Empire lias its own Ministry of War, but, in war, authority is entirely centred in the  Prussian Ministry of War, while those of the other States merely arrange local details. Only the Prussian  Ministry of War will therefore be  dealt with in this note.   The Minister of War is appointed by the Emperor,  and is the highest administrative authority in the German Army, but exer- cises no military command over the troops in the field, t   He is an ex officio member of the Prussian Cabinet, a representative in the Bundesrath and has a seat in the Reichstag.   Lieut-General Wild von  Huhenborn, who held this appoint- ment during the first part of the War,  was replaced in October, .1916, by General von Stein, who commanded the XIV.  Reserve Corps on  the Somme.   The  Minister  of War is  assisted by  a Chief of the  Acting General Staff . (Chef  des stellvertretenden Generalstabes der Armee),   The Ministry of War, which in  peace comprised six depart- ments now consists of eight:      I.

   The new departments formed in the War Ministry during the War are No. TV. (Quartering) and No. VIII. (War Bureau).   The War  Bureau  is the  department which  is &quot;charged  with utilising to the full the resources of the country for war.   Connected  with the War Bureau is a &quot;scientific  commission&quot; of 20 leading scientists, who form  a technical advisory  board; there are also legal and financial experts,  and special sections for economic.propaganda work  in neutral countries and among the troops,  and  for distributing  information  among the manufac- turers of war supplies.   4. The General Staf/.-The Staff  consists of :-    (a) The   General   Staff   (Generalstab),  including   the          Adjutantur.    (b) The Great General Staff (Grosser Generalstab).   The  General  Staff supplies officers for the whole Army.   With few exceptions, every staff officer has undergone a course of three years&apos; training at the Staff&apos;College (Kriegs-Akademie), and has been attached to the Great  General Staff, before  taking up air appointment on the staff of a Corps or division,   The  Adjutantur, Le., the  Administrative or Routine  Staff, consisted in.  peace  mainly of Staff  College graduates who had not been selected for appointment to the General Staff.

The Great General Staff is an inner ring of selected staff officers working in Berlin and at General Headquarters, directly under the Chief of  the General  Staff.   Its work comprises everything which,  comes  under the heading of  Operations, Movements and Intelligence.   5. General Headquarters. Hp to  March, 1917, General Head- quarters (Grosses  Hauptquartier)  was   at  Charleville.    The Emperor&apos;s General Headquarters was then moved back to Kreuz- nach;*  while  General Headquarters for the  Western  Frontremained at Charleville.  All orders and gazettes concerning theField Army  are issued from General Headquarters, with  theexception of administrative and technical  orders, which emanatefrom the Ministry of War.  The General  Staff at General Headquarters is presided over bythe Chief of  the General Staff of  the Field  Army, who has aspecial branch under him, concerned with operations and ammu-nition allotment.  The Quartermaster-General (Generalquartier-meister) and a branch of the Ministry of War are also at general headquarters.  In addition, there are the following Directors andheads of departments:      General of  Foot Artillery (General von der Fussartillerie).    Director &quot;of Railways (Chef des Feldeisenbahnwesens).    General  Commanding  the  Air  Forces  (Koinmandierender        Gen. der Luftstreitkrafte).    Director of Signals (Chef des Naohrichtenwesens).    Director  of Mechanical  Transport  (Chef  des  Feldekraft-        fahrwesens).* The Emperor&apos;s General Headquarters was moved to Spa in February, 1918,
f .:    ^i.-:./1:    Director of Survey (Chef des  Kriegsvermessungswesens).    Director of Medical Services (Chef des  Feldsanitatswesens).    Intendant-General of the Field Army (General-Intendant des        Feldheeres).    Director of  Anti-Aircraft  Guns  (Chef der Flug-Abwohr-        Kanonen).    Inspector of Gas Regiments (Inspekteur der Gasregimenter).  The General of the Engineer and  Pioneer Corps is at  general headquarters on the Western Front.  The War Ministry is represented by a Staff at General Head-quarters.  6. The Higher Command. The supreme command of the field army (Oberste Heeresleitung) is vested in the Emperor as Ober-kommandierender Kriegsherr.  The Emperor&apos;s principal adviserwith regard to all military operations is the Chief of the GeneralStaff of  the Field Army (Chef des GeneraIstabes des Feldheeres),who has under him  a special department dealing with operations and ammunition allotment.  Early in 19.15 General v. Moltke was succeeded as Chief of theGeneral Staff by Lieut.-General Erich van Falkenhayn.   He was,in turn, succeeded by Field-Marshal  von Hindenburg in  August,1916.  Under the Chief of the General Staff is the Erster Ober-quartiermeister, or  Deputy Chief  of the General Staff  (Luden-ludendorff).  The Emperor, nominally retains the  personal command of themain Groups of Armies operating on the Western Front.  The higher command  in the Eastern Theatre is delegated to theCommander-in-Chief on the  Eastern  Front  (OberbefehlshaberOst) and  to  the  Commander-in-Chief  in   the  South-EasternTheatre.  The  Commander-in-Chief on the  Eastern Front (Obost)  haspractically a separate General Headquarters, with the followingindependent directors:  .    Director of  Ammunition Supply (Chef des Feldmunitions-        wesens beim Obost).    Director of Medical Services (Feldsanitatsebef beim Obost).    Army-Intendant (Armee-Intendant beim Obost).  The  forces operating on  the Russo-Rounianian Front wereformed in two German Groups of Armies and one Austrian group of Armies.   There is, however, a  German Chief  of the  GeneralStaff for the Army front of the Archduke Joseph.  The South-Eastern Group of Armies  includes the Army Groupoperating on the Macedonian Front.          *  The German  Army operating on the Italian Front in 1917-1918 was nominally  under the Austro-Hungarian General Head-quarters.  A  Group  of  Armies (Heeresgruppe) consists of &quot;two to  fiveArmies,  and is commanded by a Field-Marshal or General-Oberst,

1)0     INTERIM  REPORT OE THE SUB-COMMITTEE         DEALING  WITH OFEENCES AT  SEA. REPORT AS TO THE PERSONS AGAINST WHOM, THERE IS EVIDENCE     OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR OUTRAGES CO AI JUTTED AT SEA DURING     THE WAR.   Your Sub-Committee  was appointed on November Gth,  .19.18, and consists of the following members:      :Sir JOHN MACDONELL, K.C.B., LL.D. (Chairman).     Captain V. BRANDON,  R.N. (Admiralty).     Mr.  MAURICE L.  GWYER (Ministry Of Shipping).   (Added       December .1.1th, 19.18.)     Admiral Sir REGINALD HALL,  K.C.M.G., C.B. (Admiralty).     Mr.  T.  W. II.  INSKTI&quot;, K.C.  (Admiralty).     Mr.  HERBERT E.  MANLSTY,  K.C.     Sir ERNEST  M. POLLOCK, K.C., M.P.     Mr.  C. A. RUSSELL, K.C.         Mr.  HUGH  H. L.  BELLOT, D.C.L. (Secretary).   The Sub-Committee has  held three meetings,  and a special committee, consisting  of Mr. C. A. Russell, Mr. II. E. Manisty and Captain Brandon  have made an investigation&apos; into the material  in the possession of the Admiralty, extending over  many weeks, relating to outrages committed by German submarine and other naval commanders at sea.   The following memorandum was submitted  by  them  to  the  Sub-Committee on the  20th December, 19.18,  and was adopted  by them.  It was presented to the main Committee on 7th January, 1919, and adopted  on that date.     1. Upon the  evidence at present  in  possession  of the Admiralty with regard to the persons responsible for (a) the out- rages committed during the war by German submarines,  and (6) the  analogous outrages  by the German  cruisers. &quot; Brummer &quot; and &quot; Bremse,&quot;  the Committee recommend:        That the Government take at the earliest possible moment     the necessary steps to  secure the arrest or preventive detention-     tion  and surrender of the persons named or designated in the     Lists numbered I, II,  III, IV and V in the Appendix to     this  Report with a view to  proceedings being taken  against     them for breaches of the laws of war and of humanity.  2. As  the Committee  understand that the  proceedings  to be taken to obtain, the surrender of the German Emperor are  already *under consideration, his name has  not been included in List I.  3.  With regard to the lists of Officers responsible for outrages by  submarines,  it may  be of interest to note that the  Officers responsible  for some of the most notorious cases, e.g., Kapitiin- leutnant  Schwieger,  who sank the  &quot;Lusitania,&quot; and to whom is attributed the first  deliberate  attack on a Hospital Ship (the &quot;Asturias&quot;);  Kapitanleutnant  Schneider,  who  sank the s.s.  &quot;Arabic&quot;;  Oberleutnant  Pustkuchen, who is  believed to have torpedoed the cross-Channel  s.s. &quot;Sussex&quot;; and Kapitan- leutnant  Paul Wagenfuhr, who  is  suspected of having sunk the s.s. &quot; Belgian Prince,&quot; and, after taking the crew on board his submarine,  suddenly submerged and left them to their fate, are dead;  and  that  at  present there is  not,  unfortunately,  any
 evidence to show by whom the Belgian refugee  ships &quot; AmiraJ Ganteaume&quot;  and   &quot; Harpalyce,&quot;   and  the   hospital   ships &quot; Asturias &quot; (which had escaped an earlier attack), &quot; Gloucester Castle,&quot; &quot; Dover Castle &quot; and &quot; Konigin Regentes &quot; were sunk.   4.  The evidence in some cases identifies the submarine but does not identify the  Commander,  and in these cases the list specifies the submarine and gives the  period during which the outrages attributed to  it  were committed.  It is suggested that in such cases the demand should be for the surrender of &quot;the Officer in command of such and such a  submarine in [naming month and year].&quot;   5.  The following  notes are intended  to explain the reasons why  the persons whose names appear in the several lists  were included therein.                           List I.   In  the administration of the German Navy,* the absolute  head of  affairs, both in name  and in fact, was the  Emperor.  Under him there were various authorities almost wholly independent one of  another and responsible  to him alone.  Of these authorities the principal were:  &quot;&apos;    (1) The Imperial Navy Office, presided over by the Secretary          of  State.    (2) The Emperor&apos;s Naval  Cabinet,    (3) The Admiral Staff.    (4) The Commander-in-Chief of the High Sea Fleet.    (5) The Admiral Commanding the Naval  Corps in Flanders.  The Chief of the Emperor&apos;s Naval Cabinet and the Chief of the Admiral Staff were of equal rank with the  Secretary of State, and did not  report to him, but  had direct access to the Emperor. There is reason, however, to think that while Admiral von Tirpitz was Secretary of  State, his strong personality more or less domi- nated the heads of the other two departments.  (.1)  The Secretary  of State  was the ultimate authority under the Emperor on  all  matters relating to the administration of the Navy.   He attended  the Bundesrat  and Reichstag to state and defend policy and estimates.  (2)  At the head of the Emperor&apos;s Naval Cabinet was a senior Flag  Officer, who at the same time occupied, ex officio, a position similar to that of our principal Naval Aide-de-Camp.  In  this latter capacity he was constantly with  the Emperor, was  his immediate adviser and assistant with regard to all  naval matters, and, in general,  the  channel through which he made his wishes or commands known to the sea  service.  In the Office of-the Naval Cabinet were kept all &quot; dossiers &quot; of officers,  and to it came  all  confidential  reports concerningthem.  (3)  The Admiral Staff was  modelled  to some  extent on  theplan of the Grand General Staff of the Army,  and had functionssimilar to those of the British Admiralty Naval  Staff.  It waspresided  over by  an  Admiral,  who may be  considered to havebeen the  special  technical Naval War Adviser to the Emperor.The business of  the  Admiral Staff  was  distributed  among anumber of sections.   During  the war additional sections were                   *&quot; See German Navy p.  100.
 created which  dealt with submarine warfare against  merchant ships and with questions of law and of internal and international policy arising  therefrom.  Reports  of every  cruise  made by a submarine were submitted to the Admiral Staff.   The Admiral Staff was, in theory, a purely advisory body, and was the organ for the communication of the Emperor&apos;s orders to ships with regard to their military and political employment. It  elaborated  the plans  for the conduct of naval warfare, and during the war issued detailed orders for  operations outside the North Sea. As illustrating the functions  and responsibility of the &apos;Chief  of the Admiral  Staff, it may be mentioned that the secret order for  the  commencement  of unrestricted submarine warfare was signed,  &quot; By order of  His Majesty, von Holtzen- ludendorff  &quot; von Holtzendorff being then the  Chief of the Admiral Staff.   Chief of the Admiral  Staff was, as a rule,  with the Emperor at Great General Headquarters in  the field, whilst the Deputy- Chief remained at the head of the Admiral Staff Office in  Berlin.   (4) The  submarine flotillas, based on German  ports,  formed part of the High Sea Fleet, and  were under the command of the  Commander-in-iOhief of  the  High Sea  Fleet;  and  orders relating to submarine operations of  importance passed through his hands.   It  is  almost  impossible to measure or state precisely the  extent of the  Commander-in-Chief&apos;s  influence  on,  and responsibility for, the conduct of submarine warfare, but it was probably considerable.   (5) The Flanders submarine flotillas were under the command of the Admiral commanding the Naval Corps  in Flanders, whose authority  and  position in relation  thereto were similar to those of the Commander-in-Chief of the High Sea  Fleet with regard to the submarine  flotillas based on  German ports.   There are also  included in List I., in addition to the authori- ties above  mentioned, the  officers  who  from time to time held the position  of  &quot; Leader  of  Submarines &quot;  based on German ports,  and  those  who held corresponding  positions in  Flanders and in the Mediterranean,  respectively.  Of the German orders relating to ruthless  submarine warfare, of which copies have been  obtained, many were  issued  by the   &quot; Leader of Sub- marines &quot;  based on German ports; and no doubt  similar orders relating to his  own sphere  of operations were  issued by each of the other &quot; Leaders of Submarines.&quot;                          List II.   There is primd facie  evidence to connect each of  the  officers named, and the commanding officer of each  of  the  submarines specified,  in  this list with the sinking  of  at  least  one shipwithout warning  and with accompanying  acts  of brutality orcallousness AAdiich, even  if he was acting under  the orders forunrestricted H-boat warfare,  were obviously  in excess of such orders.                          List III.  There is primd facie  evidence to connect each of  the  officersnamed,. and the commanding officer  of each  of  the  submarinesspecified,  in this list  with the sinking of  at  least  one ship
without warning.   All these cases occurred after the order forunrestricted TJ-boat warfare, and  there is no evidence, that  inany of them there were additional acts of brutality or callousness.Where there were casualties they  seem to have been incidental to the sinking of the vessel without warning.   All officers who were in command of German submarines afterthe commencement  of unrestricted.submarine warfare may havebeen  guilty to the  same  extent as those  included in this  list;but in the absence of evidence to connect them with the  sinking of  any  particular  vessel, it has  not been thought proper  toinclude  them.                          List IV.   This list relates to a few outrages which cannot  be connectedby even primd facie evidence,  at  present, with any particularofficer or any particular  submarine.  But the  Admiralty havereasons  for  believing  that  they were committed  by the  sub-marines specified in column 3 of the list, and that the respectivecommanding officers of those submarines at the time were  asshown in column 4 thereof.   The &quot; Ikaria  &quot; and  &quot; Toko  Maru &quot; were the first  merchant ships to be sunk  without warning by torpedo.   The sinkings  of  the &quot; Victoria &quot; and  the &quot; Mariston &quot; arestated to  have  been accompanied/ by conduct  of  exceptionalatrocity and callousness.   The &quot; Galway Castle &quot; was under  escort, and the submarinecommander consulted the  safety of his own vessel,  no doubt, by making off at once.  But the ship sunk  was a  passenger  shiponly and carried no  troops, and 150 lives were lost.                          List V.   The captains  of  the   German  cruisers  &quot;Brummer&quot;  and&quot;Bremse,&quot; the  persons designated in this list, were responsiblefor the sinking,  on 17th October, 19.17, of the destroyers &quot; MaryRose &quot; and  &quot; Strongbow &quot; and  of a number,of merchant shipsforming the Scandinavian Convoy.  These outrages were similar in character to  those committed by  submarines, and were  partof the ruthless warfare on merchant ships.  A Court of Inquiry,that investigated the affair,  found &quot; that the enemy made no attempt to  warn the crews  of  the merchant ships to abandon their ships before shelling them,&quot; and that they did not &quot; makeany efforts to rescue survivors.&quot;   There were indignant comments in the Scandinavian press  asto the way in which the crews  of  the merchant ships were leftto drown; and reports  have  been received from various  sourcesthat after the effect on Scandinavian opinion had been observed,the captains of tile  &quot; Brummer  &quot; and &quot; Bremse &quot; were relieved of their commands.

 INTERIM REPORT OP THE SUB-COMMITTEE DEALING             WITH OFFENCES IN THE AIR.   Your Sub-Committee was appointed on 19th November,  1918, and consists of the following members:     Sir E.UNEST M.  POLLOCK, K.C., M.P. (Chairman).    Major  M. BEACHECROFT (Air Ministry).    Mr. C. R. BRIGSTOCKE (Air Ministry).    Colonel E. H. DAVIDSON, O.B.E., M.C. (Air Ministry).    Mr. HERUERT F. MANISTY, K.C.    Mr. HUGH H. L. BELLOT, D.C.L. (Secretary).   The Sub-Committee  has  held three  meetings  and has con- sidered  the charges  to be preferred against enemy airmen,  viz.: First,  wilful and  reckless  bombardment of  hospitals,  and secondly,  indiscriminate  bombardment,  without any  military objective, of  towns  and places..  In the case of the first class of charges, although we  have reason to  believe that a prima facie case  exists  against  certain enemy airmen, we are  not yet in a position to come  to any definite conclusion until  the evidence relating to the bombardment of  hospitals in France  received from  that country has been more carefully considered than has been possible since its receipt.   In the case of the  second class of charges, after examination of the evidence  placed before  us  by the Air Ministry, we are of opinion  that  a prima facie case exists against enemy airmen of indiscriminate bombardment by them of undefended towns and places in Great Britain, without any military objective.  The Sub-Committee therefore recommends :       &quot; That H.M. Government take at  the earliest  possible    moment the necessary steps to secure the arrest or preventive    detention and surrender of the persons named or designated    in the  list of names appended hereto, with  a  view to pro-    ceedings  being taken against them for breaches of the laws    and customs of  war and of the laws  of humanity.&quot;                      LIST OF NAMES.   (The  list  of  names  is  already in the possession  of  H.M. Government  and  of the  Committee.   Other  names  will  besubmitted from time to time).

This Report was presented to the Main Committee  on 7th January,  .1919,  and adopted by them on that date.
   REPORT OF  SPECIAL SUB-COMMITTEE  ON LAW. To THE RIGHT HONOURABLE THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL. SIR,     You  desire, as we understand from the  Chairman and Vice- Chairman,  that a Special Sub-Committee of  the  Committee  of Enquiry into Breaches of the Laws of War  should report to you directly, with as little delay as possible, and without waiting for a meeting of the Main Committee, upon the  following questions :     (1) Whether  it is desirable to  take proceedings against the           German Kaiser?     (2) What  should be  the  nature and  Constitution  of the          . Tribunal for the  trial of the German Kaiser?     (3) What  should be  the chief heads of the charges to be           preferred against him ?     (4) What should be the law to be applied by the Tribunal ?     (5) What should be its procedure?  These questions cover a great part of the matters referred to the  Committee  under the  terms of  the  original  reference of November 5th,  19.18.   They deal with  subjects  as  to  which inquiries  are not yet completed.  We have  had no opportunity of ascertaining the opinion of the Committee  as to some  of the most important  of the above questions; and the answers  which we  now give to them are subject  to further examination  and also to  the  oourse which other Allied Governments may  decide to take.  With this reservation, which we desire to emphasize, our  answer to  the first of these questions  is contained  in the following  recommendations:    (1) That  it is desirable  to  take proceedings  against the           German Kaiser.  This  involves  a  question of policy;  but in view  of the grave charges which  might be  preferred  and established against the Kaiser,  the vindication of the principles  of International Law, which he  has violated, would be incomplete  were.he not brought. to trial.&quot; Moreover, the trial&quot; of other offenders might be seriously pre- prejudiced, if they could plead the superior orders of a  sovereign against  whom no steps had been taken.  We are, therefore,  of opinion that it is desirable the  Kaiser should be  brought  to trial.    (2)  That an International Tribunal be established  composed          of representatives of the chief  Allied States and the          United  States  for the trial  and  punishment  of the          Kaiser as well as other offenders against the laws and          customs of war and the laws of humanity.    (3)  That H.M. Government appoint to  such Tribunal (say)          six members, four of  whom shall  be of judicial or          legal experience,  one a  naval, and one a military          representative.    (4)  That the chief Allied States and the United States have          like representation.
     (5)  That,  in addition to the members above mentioned, an           opportunity be given to such other of the Allied States           as in the opinion of  the chief Allied  States and  the           United  States should  be  represented  to  appoint a           member or members of the Tribunal.   It  seems to us that the trial of  the Kaiser ought to be by an International Tribunal, free from national bias, the decisions of which would possess unquestionable authority, which would speak in the name  of the conscience of the world, which would help to re-estahlish and strengthen International  Law, and which in  the future would be a deterrent and warning to rulers and highly placed officials who meditated or instigated offences against Inter- national Law.   In the proceedings and decisions of  such a  Tribunal all States are interested, but not all equally so.   For reasons which we need not elaborate, certain States may justly claim a larger  share of representation in the composition of the Tribunal.  But  we have not  thought  it  advisable to suggest the precise proportions in which all the various States should be  represented; such a matter being peculiarly one for the discretion of His Majesty&apos;s Govern- ment.   We have considered, as we understand was desired, the ques- tion whether neutral  States ought to be represented upon the Tribunal, and we have arrived at the following conclusions, viz.:  That no representative  of Neutral States be admitted to niem- membership of the Tribunal, unless for very special reasons.  The Special Sub-Committee recognise the apparent advantages attaching to  the presence of such representatives; they would lend, it  might be said,  to  the  Tribunal a more distinct  Inter- national character.    There are,  however, as it seems to  us, decisive  objections  to  their admission.  In coming to this con- clusion we cannot ignore the fact that in  all probability,  having regard to the ethnical, economic and  geographical character of certain of the neutral States, their representatives might not be free from pressure  or apprehension of pressure.   In  the course of the war, it may  be added, those States which most distinctly represented neutral  interests, or which took  steps to  assert the rights of neutrals, became belligerents.  There  is  also  force,  we  think,  in the argument recently advanced by  the French  Government  against the appointment of a  neutral  representative  to  a Commission of Enquiry into Bulgarian outrages  against  Greek subjects, viz., that there is a possibility  of  an undue tendency on the part of such repre- sentatives to  contend that outrages were equally  committed  by both belligerents.  Any expression of dissentient opinion of this character on the part of a neutral representative might &quot;seriously compromise the decisions of the Tribunal.  As  to the second  question, namely, What should be the chiefheads of the charges to be preferred against the Kaiser ? It hasbeen suggested that one charge should be based upon his havingprovoked or brought about an aggressive and unjust  war.    Inthe opinion of the civilised world  a great crime against humanityand in breach of International Law, was committed by the Kaiser.
 in conjunction with his Ministers and military advisers.   One of the main objects of bringing him to trial would be defeated if foremost among  the charges to be made against him  was not that of,  having long, planned and  deliberately  instigated an aggressive and unjust war.   On the other hand,  to the inclusion of this  charge there are several objections, not the least important of which  is the fact that it  might  involve a  prolonged  examination  of  the whole political  situation,   the political difficulties  and  controversies preceding August 4th, 1914,  and,  indeed,  the entire political history of Europe  for some years before that date.   It might be  difficult to  set  limits  to  such enquiries, and the effect of entering  upon it might be to  distract attention from  the grave and much more precise charges enumerated below.   It is also to be observed that, however morally reprehensible the Kaiser&apos;s  conduct in this  matter may have  been, he  may have been acting constitutionally.   Under  the Constitution of .187.1 he Avas not completely sovereign.    The  sovereign powers were not  vested in him alone.  (See Laband, Das Staatsrecht des Deutschen Eeiches,   5 Ed. 1. 215 as  to the Kaiser&apos;s powers.)   For a  declaration of Avar in. the  name of  the Empire, the consent of the Bundesrath  is required unless an attack is made upon the Federal  territory or its coasts.   (Art.  II.)   His conduct in this respect might be said to be a political act, the guilt of Avhich  is shared by the  German nation,  the repre- sentatives of Avhich  Avere the Bundesrath and Reichstag.   But it may be rejoined that the conduct of a sovereign might be constitutionally correct and, nevertheless, might be a grave breach of International Law.   The  Special  Sub-Committee,  having  considered  these con- conflicting views, Avere in faArour of including among  the above charges that of having provoked or brought about  an  aggressive and unjust war.*   In any case, the Kaiser\s responsibility, as it seems to  us, for acts done  or sanctioned by him in his military and naval capacity after the invasion of Belgium,  in breach of the  Treaties of 1831 * and 1839, and  of Luxemburg,  in breach of the Treaty of 1867, and for the series of  violations,  numerous and varied, of the laws and customs of Avar  committed  on land, at  sea and  from the  air, by the military,  naval and aviation forces   of  Germany, is unquestionable.   His position  in relation to these forces is thus denned  by the Constitution.   By Art. 18  the  Emperor shall appoint&apos; Imperial officials and cause them  to  take  the oath to the  Empire  and dismiss them when necessary.   By Art. 53  the  Navy of  the  Empire shall form a  &quot;unity &quot; &apos; under the supreme command of the Emperor.   The Emperor is charged with its organisation and construction;  he  shall appoint the officers and officials of  the  Navy, and  they  and the seamen shall take an oath of obedience  to him.  By Art. 63 the total land forces of  the Empire shall form one army,  Avhich shall be under the command of  the Emperor  inwar and in peace.         0 This resolution Avas carried by four to three,20962                                                 D
  By Art.  G4 all  German troops  are bound  to  render  uncon-ditional obedience to the commands of the Emperor.  This, obli-gation shall  be included  in the  military  oath.   .  ,   .  Theofficers appointed by him shall take the military oath to him.  Proof no doubt will be  forthcoming that  the Kaiser actuallyused these large powers; that he was in truth the &quot; War  Lord &quot;and  &quot; Commander-in-Chief &quot; of the Navy &quot;; and  that he took part in the  military  and naval  operations and  was in  close touch with his officers in such operations.  Such being his  constitutional position,  both in theory  andin practice, for all acts ordered  or approved by him during thewar, whether by explicit order or approval shown by long courseof conduct, he is, it is suggested, responsible.  The enquiries of the Committee have not reached a stage atwhich it is possible to state precisely the  charges which shouldbe preferred  against him.  The  Committee  are still engaged ininvestigating these matters.   The following  suggestions are sub-ject to re-consideration, and may be modified by the Committee.But, provisionally,  the following heads of charges  may be sug-gested, viz.:        1. Waging an Aggressive and Unjust War.     2. Invasion of  Belgium  and  Luxemburg in Breach of          Treaties.     3. Systematic. Terrorism in Belgium and Prance.     4. Illegal Methods of Submarine Warfare.      5. Destruction of Hospital  Ships.      6. Directions to give &quot;No Quarter.&quot;      7. Promiscuous  Bombardment from the Air of Undefended          Towns and Villages.      8. Deliberate Bombardment of Hospitals from the Air.      9. Bombardment from the  Sea of Undefended  Ports, Towns           and Places.     10&apos;. Execution of Edith  Cavell and Captain Fryatt.     11. Execution of Civilians in Occupied Territories.     12. Ill-treatment of Prisoners of  War.     13. Deportation of Civil Population in  Occupied Territories           and Forced Labour.     14. Murder of Hostages.     15. Use  of Illegal Methods  of Warfare.   These are  mere  general  indications of  the  possible  charges which at this stage,  not  knowing the conclusions of  the  Com-mittee  and the Land and  Sea Sub-Committees,  we  have notformulated precisely.   (3) As to the third question, viz., What law should be  applied by the Tribunal? It is conceived that the Tribunal should apply the laws and customs of war.   In  the main, these are  containedin the Hague  Convention II.  of  1899 and Convention  IV. of1907, to both of which Germany  was a party, and which maybe taken to be, on the whole, an  accurate, though not exhaustive,statement of  such laws and customs.   It is true that the  regula-tions contained in- these Conventions do not apply except betweencontracting Powers, and then only if all the  belligerents ware
parties to the Convention (see Art. 2 of Convention IT. of J907);which was not the case throughout the present war.  But Art. 4of 1907 states that &quot;the Convention of 1899 remains in force asbetween the Powers which signed it and which do not also ratify the present Convention.&quot;  All the belligerents, as far as we are aware,  have ratified theConvention II.  of the Hague Conference,  1899.  At all  events, the regulations probably correctly express &quot; theprinciples of the law of nations,  as they result from the usagesestablished among civilised peoples,  from the laws of humanityand the dictates of the public conscience.&quot;  There  are no comprehensive Conventions relating to the laws and  customs of maritime  warfare.   But there exists  Conyen-tion II.  of 1899,  viz.:  &quot;Maritime  Warfare  and the geneva convention&quot;;  and there  are  also  rules to be  found  on thesubject in the Naval Codes and Prize Law of the chief maritimeStates, the decisions of  Prize Courts  and  the opinions  of autho-ritative text-writers.  As to the fourth question, viz. :  What should be the procedure of the Tribunal? There are at present, broadly stated, two types of Criminal Procedure, the Anglo-American and the French; theformer based upon the accusatory principle, the latter originallyupon the inquisitorial.   It is  suggested that neither should be strictly adhered to.   The procedure ought  to be  as simple aspossible, consistently  with justice to the accused.    The pro-ceedings should be public and mainly oral, and witnesses shouldbe liable to examination and cross-examination.    The accusedshould be entitled to the assistance of counsel.  Had the Kaiserbeen captured in the field he would have  been liable to be tried by a Military Court,  and some modification of  the procedure ofsuch a Court might be suitable for his trial by the international tribunal suggested  herein.  In making these recommendations it should be understood thatthe Main Committee and the Sub-Committee have far from com?pleted their enquiries, that they are not  aware of the opinionsand  proposals of  the Associated Governments,  and  that  theabove recommendations  are subject to revision and  re-considera-tion.  In conclusion,  we desire  to express our strong  opinion thatthe article  or articles in  the Treaty of Peace, providing forjuris-diction over the enemy  offenders, should, if  possible, be drawn in the most comprehensive terms.*     Signed on behalf of the Special Sub-Committee,                                    JOHN  MACDONELL.

SECTION  1.                 ADMIRALTY  ADMINISTRATION.                            INTRODUCTION.  The German Navy in the proper sense of the term has only existed forrather more  than 40 years,  though,  long  before tho foundation  of  theEmpire, there were of course German war vessels,  Prior to the Franco-German war, the North German Confederation had decided to build,  within the next 10 years, a Navy  consisting of 16 iron-clads, 20 frigates  and corvettes,  8 despatch vessels, and 22 gun  boats;but before these could  well be commenced war broke out, and throughoutthe war the then existing German Navy played a very  minor part.  On the formation of the Empire/ the Navy, unlike the Army, becameImperial, and the first real attempt at  any organisation was made under General von  Stosch,  who  was  appointed  Chief of tho Admiralty  andremained in  that position until 1882.  General von Stosch was succeeded by General von Caprivi, who remained in office until 1888, but as during the tenure of office of both the  above-named officers the Navy was  treated mainly as a defensive force,  practi-cally  no battleships  were built and  little  advance  was made  until  the advent to the throne of the present Emperor.  One of his  first acts was to replace General von Caprivi by an Admiral,and  shortly afterwards the two chief  posts of Secretary of State, for theImperial Navy Office and Oommander-in-Chief of the Fleet were created and  filled respectively by Admirals Heussuer  and Von der Goltz.  Under this  system of administration, and  largely owing to the Emperor&apos;sforesight and. energy,  in  addition  to  the fact that  he  made  himselfCommander-in-Chief  of the Navy, the  first Elect Act was passed in 1898.  Under this Act a continuous  shipbuilding policy was established insteadof the previous intermittent arrangements,  and a shipbuilding programmelaid  down to  the  end of the financial year  1903-1904 j and in 1900 a newAct was passed further raising  the number of ships to  lie laid down and making provision as regards  numbers up to the year 1920.  The Act of 1900 was further amended in  1906, agaiii in the direction ofan increase,  and  in 1908 the  age of replacement  of  battleships, whichhad hitherto  been 25 years, was reduced to 20 years.  Further legislation as to the  strength of the Fleet took  place in 1912,and  the result may be summarised by the  statement that before the warthe strength  of the German Fleet had been fixed at                            41 battleships,                           20 large  cruisers,                           40 small  cruisers,                          144 destroyers,                            72 submarines,which strength was to  be attained in  the year 1920.
  There is a further  factor in the development  of  German naval affairs in recent  years which is of great importance,  viz.,  the construction and subsequent  widening  of  the Kaiser  Wilhehn  Canal, which  has greatly strengthened and improved the naval position.  ft will be seen then that since 1898 the history  of  the German Navy hasbeen one of continuous, rapid and methodical progress as regards materialconstruction, while the necessary  increase, organisation,  and training ofthe  personnel  in  all  branches  has  kept   pace   with   the  increasedrequirements.  During  these  years public  interest  in the  Navy had  been  graduallygrowing, greatly stimulated by the personal interest  taken by the Emperorin the sea  service, and by the efforts and -widespread organisation of&apos; theNavy League,  whereby knowledge of naval affairs was diffused  amongthe population throughout the Empire; and a national pride in  the Navy,similar  to  that which Germany has always had  for her Army, grew  up and  became an important  factor in the life of the  country.  Although the  Memorandum to  the German  Fleet Act of 1.900  is nowancient history,  it will not be out of place to  give  the following extracts from it, as it lays down the standard  at which  the new German Navy Avasto aim  and up  to which,  they  have  been steadily  working for the  last18 years; while  in the light of later  events the strategical considerationslaid  down  in the Memorandum  are  of special interest.                   MEMOKANUUM TO FLEET ACT, 1900.        1. Necessity for, and Extent of, the&apos; Increase  of the Navy.   &quot; For  tho  German  Empire  of  to-day  the security  of  its economic development,  especially its  commerce, is  a vital  question.  To this end&apos; the German Empire requires not only  peace on land but also peace  at sea not, however, peace at any price, but peace with honour, such as is its due.   &quot; A  naval  war  concerning economic  interests,  especially  commercial interests, will presumably be of  long duration, for the object of a superior adversary will be  the  more completely attained the  longer the war con- tinnes.  It follows, therefore, that a naval war which,  after the  destruction or locking  up  of the German naval forces,  is limited to  the blockade of the coasts and the  capture of merchant ships all over the world, would not cost our adversary much; on the  contrary, the expenses of the war would easily be defrayed by  the  simultaneous increase of his  own trade.   An unsuccessful war  lasting even  one  year  would put  an  end to German seaborne trade, and  would  therefore have a most  disastrous effect  in the first place on economic  and, as an immediate result, on social conditions.   &quot; Quite apart from  the consequences of the  terms  of peace  that might have to be made, the destruction of overseas commerce during a war would not be made  good for  a very long time after its  termination, and  then to the  sacrifices of  the war would  be  added  a  very  serious economic decline.   &quot; The Fleet  Act  [of 1898] does not provide for the possibility of a naval war against a  great  naval Power because, when it was drawn up in 1897, the chief point was to  ensure the carrying out of the fleet scheme of 1873 in up-to-date material, ...   &quot; The argument  to the Fleet  Act allowed of no doubt as to the military value  of the battle fleet.  There  it is expressly stated &apos; against the more; important  Naval  Powers the battle fleet  has solely the significance of a fleet for surprise  attack &apos;;  which is to  say  that the  fleet must withdraw into harbour  and  wait for  a favourable opportunity for  a sortie.   &quot; Even should, it  be successful in such an action, it will  suffer great losses  of ships  just as the enemy will.  A strong adversary can make good the losses we  cannot,  In  a  war with a considerably superior  naval Power,  the battle  fleet provided by the Fleet Act can  make  a blockade difficult, especially in the first stages of the war, but can never prevent it.- It will always be only  a question of time  until it is either -beaten or shut up  in. its own harbours after  considerable loss.   Directly  this happens
 there is no great Power which can be more easily cut oil&apos; from any maritime intercourse worth consideration-whether by means of its own or neutral ships-than Germany.   &quot; This would not call for tho blockade of  long stretches of coast, but only of the few large  ports.   &quot; In the same manner as the trade of home ports, German merchantmen all over the world  are at the mercy of a more powerful enemy.   Hostilo cruisers on the principal  trade routes in the Skagerrak and  the  English Channel, to the  North of Scotland,  in the Straits  of  Gibraltar, at the entrance to the Suez Canal, and at the Cape  of  Good Hope would  make German maritime commerce almost impossible.   &quot; As to this  it is expressly stated in the  argument to the Fleet Act:   &apos; In  time  of peace  the protection of  trade  in  every  sea is of paramount importance.  In time  of  war it will be  the duty of the foreign service cruisers to afford the  greatest  possible protection to  their own merchant vessels.&apos;   That is to  say, the  ships  are to do their utmost.  What-  is possible in this respect becomes apparent Avhen it is  borne  in mind that the Fleet Act provides for a total of 42 cruisers,  while, for example, the greatest naval  Power of to-day  possesses &apos;206 cruisers  ready and in course of construction, and has, besides, at its disposal, bases and coaling stations on all the principal trade routes.   &quot; For the protection of trade and the  colonies  there  is only one thing that  will suffice, namely,  a  strong  battle fleet.   &quot; In order to  protect  Germany&apos;s sea-borne trade  and colonies under existing conditions, oidy  one thing will  suffice,  namely,  Germany  must possess a battle fleet of such a  strength that,  even for the most powerful adversary,  a war would involve such  risks  as to  make that Power&apos;s own supremacy  doubtful,   &quot; For this purpose it is not absolutely  necessary that the German fleet should  be as strong as that of  the greatest naval Power, for, as  a  rule, a great naval Power will, not be in a position to concentrate all its forces against  us.  Even if  it were successful in  bringing  against  us  a much superior force,  the defeat  of a  strong German  fleet would so considerably weaken the enemy that, in  spite of the victory that might be achieved, his own supremacy would no longer  be  assured  by  a fleet of sufficient strength.  &quot;For the.attainment of this object, viz., protection of our sea-borne trade and  of colonies  by assuring peace  with  honour, Germany requires, according to the strength  of the great naval Powers and  with regard to our  tactical formations, two double squadrons of first-class battleships, with  the necessary attendant cruisers,  torpedo boats,  &amp;c.  &quot; The number of vessels  in  commission  in  peace  is  governed   by the following considerations: Since the  number  of   ships of  the  German Navy, even after carrying out the proposed  increase,  will be more  or less inferior to that of other individual Powers,  compensation must be  sought in the  training of  the personnel and in  the  tactical training   of the squadrons.  &quot; A sound training of  individual ships&apos;  crews,  as  well  as a sufficient tactical training of&apos;the squadrons, can  only  be  secured  by  continuous commissions  in  peace.  To economise  in  the latter in peace means  that the efficiency of a fleet is  doubtful in time  of war.  &quot; The minimum for  peace time is to have permanently in commission a fleet consisting of the newest  and best  ships as  an  active fleet,  i.e., a fleet of which all the  battleships and cruisers  are in commission.   This fleet forms  the  school  for  tactical squadron  training,  and  bears the  first brunt of battle in war. It  must suffice  in  the case  of  the  second fleet,wjiich is composed of  the  older  battleships, if only half the  vessels arecontinuously in  commission.   For  squadron  training,  additional  shipsmust, of course, be&apos; commissioned for  the manoeuvres.  In case of war,this second  fleet the reserve battle fleet protected by the active battle fleet,  must  make  up for  the inferior  training of the individual ships&apos;companies arid  the lack of squadron training after mobilisation.
  Increase of Foreign Service Ships.    &quot; In addition to the increase  of the homo battle fleet, an increase  of  the foreign service ships  is also  necessary.   .  .   .  In order to estimate  tho importance of an increase  in our foreign service  ships, it must  be  realised that  they represent Germany&apos;s Navy  abroad,  and that to them  often falls the task of gathering fruits which have ripened as a  result  of  tho naval strength of the Empire embodied in  the homo battle fleet.    &quot; Besides,  a sufficient force  on tho spot,  supported  by  a strong homo  battle fleet, in many cases prevents differences and  so  contributes  to tho  maintenance of peace with full protection -of German, honour and German  interests.&quot;                  ADMIRALTY   ADMINISTRATION    The keystone of tho whole system of the administration  of the German  Navy is that  the.  absolute head  of affairsj both  in name and in fact,  is  the Emperor.  Under  him  there are various  authorities almost  wholly  independent of one another and responsible to him alone.  In Berlin these  authorities are:       (1) The Imperial Navy  Office (Iteichs-Marine-Amt) which,  under the           presidency of  the  Secretary of State,  provides  and maintains           the Navy (see  p.  ).     (2) The Emperor&apos;s Naval  Cabinet  (Murine-Kabinett),  which  deals           with most of the personnel matters (with regard  to officers) and           acts as  a connecting link between the Emperor and the Navy           (see  p.   ).     (3)  The Admiral Staff (Admiralstab der Marine), which combines our           Admiralty War Staff,  Operations and Intelligence  Divisions           (see  p.   ).   Outside Berlin there are      (4)  The Inspector-General of the Navy.     (5)  The Commanders-in-Chief of  the Baltic and North  Sea  Stations.     (6)  The various Inspections.     (7)  The Commander-in-Chief  of the High Sea Fleet.   Before tho war there were  also      (8)  The Commander-in-Chief  of the China Squadron.     (9)  Officers in  independent commands abroad.   With  reference to these two last, all officers  in independent commands abroad  were  directly responsible to  the Emperor for any political  or military  transactions  undertaken by  them in the course of their  duty, which were reported to him through the Chief of  the Admiral Staff.   It was only in the early part  of 1914 that all sections of  the Admiralty Administration in  Berlin were brought together under one  roof.  Before that they had all  been  in different buildings widely separated,  but now the three departments,  viz.      (a) the Imperial Navy Office,     (b) the Admiral  Staff,     (c) the Emperor&apos;s Naval  Cabinet, are all  housed together  in  a  new  building  at  the  corner  of  Konigin^ Augusta and Bendler  Strassen.   The  Chief of the  Admiral Staff and  Chief  of the Emperor&apos;s Naval Cabinet  are  of  equal rank with  the Secretary  of the Navy  and do not report to him, and  it would at first sight appear that under this organisa- tion friction  must necessarily  arise between  these  three independent departments, all having direct access to the Emperor and unable to give direct  orders to one another,  while delay would in many cases be caused by the  necessity of personal reference to the Emperor  in-the case of a conflict of opinion upon matters of importance.   There  is reason to think that  while  Admiral von Tirpitz was Secretary of the Navy his strong personality more or less dominated the heads ofthe other two  departments, but  that  since he ceased to hold this  office the heads of the other two departments have  been of as great,  if not ofmore, importance than that of the Secretary  of State of the Navy.
  However this may be, tho  efficiency of tho  Administration  of theGerman Admiralty  under the personal supervision of the Emperor,  whois Commander-in-Chief of tho Navy in time of peace as well as in timeof Avar, though only  Commander-in-Chief of  the Army in time of war,admits of no doubt.                     THE IMPERIAL NAVY  OFFICE                        (Beichs-Marine-Amt).  At  the  head of this  is the  Secretary of State,  who is the iltimate authority  under the Emperor  on all matters relating to the administrationof the Navy.

The above  distribution of business in tho Beichs-Marine-maintenance, is clearly in  some particulars only applicable during the war,  but in  its  main lines as regards division into departments and sections, it is very much as it hasbeen for some years, and will probably be after the war.      ........      THE EMPEROR&apos;S NAVAL CABINET.                          (Marinc-Kabinctt.)  This is situated in the Imperial Navy Office  in Berlin.  At its head is a senior  flag officer who at the same  time occupies exofjicio a similar position to our principal naval aide-de-camp.  His staff consists normally  of a  Kwpitan zvr See, a  KaylUinleuinant,and a naval engineer.  Tho work of the &quot;office consists of making all naval appointments, warningofficers of their approaching retirement or non-employment, and issuing allpromotions, honours, and rewards.  In the office are kept all &quot; dossiers &quot;  of  officers, and to it  come all con-fidential reports concerning them.  The chief as senior naval aide-de-camp is constantly with&apos;the Emperor,is his adviser and assistant with regard to all naval matters, and in generalthe channel through which he  makes his wishes or commands  known to thosea service.  Naval attaches  or other foreign naval  officers who may have  business.with the Emperor must make their applications to the chief of this office.                          THE ADMIRAL STAFF.                       (Admiralstab der Marine.)  The Admiral Staff is modelled to some extent on the plan of the GrandGeneral Staff  of - the  Army,  and has  functions similar to  those of theBritish Admiralty Naval Staff.  Mobilisation is dealt with by the ImperialNavy  Office.  It is presided over by an Admiral, who may be considered as the special technical  Naval War Adviser  to the Emperor.  To it belong all Admiral Staff  Officers, whether serving at the head- quarters at Berlin or on the  staffs of Admirals either at home or abroad. Those serving in Berlin  are  generally designated as  the Grand  Admiral Staff.   In addition to the  above,  the Director and Directing Officers of the Naval  Academy at Kiel  are  members, and  two military  officers of the General Staff are attached to the  Admiral Staff,  They do  not, however, live permanently in the  Admiralty  in normal times,  but  visit the office when  required.
Ill   Similarly, two officers of  the Admiral Staff  are attached to the Army General  Staff.   The composition of the Admiral Staff immediately before the war was as follows:       One  Admiral   .........  Chief of Staff.       ,,  Oberlcutnant  zur  Sec ...  Adjutant to  Chief of Staff.     Five Kapitdne zur  See     ...  Heads of  Sections.     Three Fregattenkapitdne   ... (Ono as head of a Section.)     Eight Korvettcnkapitdnc-  ...  (One for duty with Inspector-General                                       of tho Navy.)     Four Kupitdnleutnants.     One  Engineer Officer       ...  (Also   attached  to  tho   Emperor&apos;s                                       Naval Office.)          Librarian       ......(A Captain  &quot; sur Disposition.&quot;)                         Attached temporarily.     One Kapitan zur See      ... (A.d.O. to the Emperor.)     Three Kapitanleutnants.                              Attached.                        One Kapitan  zur See.                         ,,   Fregattenkapitdn.                        Two Korvettenkapitdne.                        Three Kapitdnleutnants.   In addition to  the  Naval  Officers employed there  is a numerous  staff of civilian officials and subordinate civil employes.   As regards the permanent and secretarial staff,  two classes of secfe- taries are employed, viz., Admiral Staff and Office Secretaries.   The  former  include  Geheime Bechmmgs  Bate,  who were  transferred from the Imperial Navy Office when  the Admiral Staff was  formed in 1899;  this class is dying out.   Since 1901 this branch has been recruited from  Assistant Paymasters, secretaries of the Naval Intendance Department and subordinate officers of the Accountant Branch  who have  passed certain  examinations.   In addition to other  qualifications, candidates must engage to learn at their own expense  any foreign language designated by the  Admiral Staff.  Office Secretaries form a separate  branch and  are paid  at  somewhat lower rates than the Admiral Staff Secretaries.  Warrant Officers and  Petty Officers  may  be  appointed for  additional duties,  e.g., extra, writers, draughtsmen, &amp;c.  Orderlies are drawn from the Naval Service.  At  the  outbreak of war the distribution  of  business was  roughly asshown  in the  following table:                Section.                         Business.  I. Central       ......  a.

German and  Foreign  Press.  During tho war,  however,  a series of reorganisations have  taken place,accompanied by very  considerable expansion.  Additional  Sections have .been created  dealing with stabmarine  warfare against  merchant ships indifferent parts of the world  and with questions  of  law and of internal and  international policy arising therefrom.  The  Secret Service  Section and Contre-Espionage  Section have been much expanded, and a special Sabotage Section has been added.  There isalso  a  Section charged  with the duty  of writing the history  of the navalwar.  The  Admiral Staff is in  theory purely an advisory body and is the organfor the communication of the Emperor&apos;s orders to ships with regard totheir  military and political  employment.   To  it,  therefore,  appertaintho transmission  of sailing orders and the special instructions regardingthe  political1 uses of the  ships.  In these instructions  the  Foreign Officeco-operates, or it may even have originated  them.  In accordance with this policy all officers  in command of,  or about totake command of, ships and stations have to attend at the offices  of thoAdmiral Staff for two or three days in order to make themselves acquainted with the problems that may await them  at  their destination.  The  Admiral Staff assigns  staff work  to   ships abroad or proceedingabroad, and  receives reports on the same  both from those ships and fromthe senior  officers on foreign  stations  who are locally  responsible for thestaff work of ships under  their  orders.  All Commanding   Officers maycorrespond direct with the  Admiral  Staff  on matters of political  andmilitary import.  In addition to the foregoing, the Admiral Staff carries out the followingduties  in peace time:      1.  It elaborates the plans  for the conduct  of  naval Avarfare both at          home and abroad.    2.  It  collects,   collates,   and  elaborates   all  military,   political,          geographical, and  technical  intelligence  concerning the various          countries  and their navies  Avhich may be useful for Avar.    3.  It elucidates all  matters that are of importance  for the strategical          or tactical employment  of naval forces in Avar time.    4.  In concert with the Coramanders-in-Chief  of  the High Sea Fleet          and the  Home Stations, it draws up  the  yearly  manoeuvre          programmes.    5.  It conducts   historical research and  publishes  papers  regarding          maritime Avarfare, more especially  Avith reference  to  their          application to  the uses  of the  German  Navy.    6.  It issues handbooks on the navies and  resources of foreign countries,         , on the tactical and strategical uses  of  ships and  armaments,          rules for fleet exerciseB, Ac.    7.  It makes  provision for  and supervises the  training  of  suitable          officers for Admiral Staff duties.  During the war all announcements  in regard to naval operations havebeen signed  by the Chief or Deputy-Chief   of the  Admiral  Staff.  TheChief  of the Admiral  Staff  has been, as a rule, with the  Emperor at
 Great General Headquarters in the field, whilst the Deputy-Chief remained at  the head  of the Admiral  Staff Office in Berlin.  At the end of August,  1918,  the powers  of  the Chiof of the Admiral Staff   were   much   extended,   and   a   special  Naval  War   Staff (Seeliriegsleitung)  was  established   at  Great  General   Headquarters. Through the medium of this special staff, at the head of which  is a senior Captain, the Chief of the Admiral Staff can  now issue orders to individual Squadrons or to local commands.  The Chief  of  the Admiral Staff is directly responsible to the Emperor, and so  in theory is entirely independent of the Secretary of State, but in practice their duties overlap.   - This  has  caused  difficulties,  and  it is notorious that various  Chiefs of the Admiral Staff have been relieved at the instance of the Secretary of State.  Except through  the  medium of the  Emperor,  the  Admiral Staff,  till September, 1918, had no means  of controlling, modifying, or influencing policy, inasmuch as it might not correspond  direct with the Foreign  Office or  the  Imperial  Chancellor.   A  Cabinet Order of 16th  September,  1918, however, placed  the  Admiral Staff  in a position to communicate  direct with the principal  Government Departments and  the Imperial Chancellor. Up  to  this  date  any necessary modifications  had  to  pass  through  the Emperor&apos;s Naval Cabinet for counter-signature by the Secretary  of  State and issue to  tho Navy, and it was at  this point that difficulties arose.  The Emperor calls on  the  Chief  of the  Admiral Staff  for reports on any subject connected with navies or naval warfare, which must  necessarily^include training,  and  the latter may  bring  to his notice schemes  for changes of all kinds  in  connection with  the Navy.  Yet  officially he  has nothing  to   do  with  shipbuilding programmes,  designs or armaments, which are jealously guarded prerogatives of the Central Department of  the Navy Office,  or with mobilisation, which is supervised by a special section at the Navy  Office  and. the Commanders-in-Chief of the Baltic and North Sea stations.   He  is,  however, frequently consulted  regarding   these matters.  With regard to the  High Sea  Fleet, the  Chief of the Admiral Staff is solely  concerned,  in   co-operation  with the  Commander-in-Chief,  in theoretical considerations of the larger  questions concerning the conduct of warfare,  but the Oommander-in-Chief (again  responsible only to  tho Emperor) is  in no  way fettered  thereby.  During important manoeuvres  the Chief of the  Admiral Staff  has frc- quently hoisted  his flag on board a  ship of  the High Sea Fleet, but  did not  take command  in  any way.  In common with the Secretary of State and the  Chief of the  Emperor&apos;s Naval Cabinet, the Chief of the Admiral Staff  receives brief daily reports from the various commands at home concerning matters of  general naval interest and  movements of ships, and he is also  informed whenever any ship becomes  unavailable for service  for more than four days.

PRELIMINARY  REMARKS BY  TRANSLATOR.  The German  original  consists  of  a  handbook  of  136  pages, of whichpages 1-56 have been translated in this pamphlet.  The remaining pages have not  been  included ;  they contain two Appen-dices, namely:-    Appendix 1 : -      A. German  official list of articles of contraband; B. C. and D.        Lists of articles of  contraband, alphabetically arranged  in  the       German, English and Swedish languages.   I Appendix 2 : -     &apos; List in German  of Swedish prohibited exports.  It is stated in the PrefaC6*that the aim of the book is &quot;to facilitate the application of the Prize Regulations.&quot;   A  perusal  will show, how-ever, that one of its main objects is  rather to  show  how these regulations and  every proviso  of  International  Law for  the safety  of Neutrals  canbe evaded on some  plea of military necessity.  Interesting points from  a legal point of view  are the German idea ofwhat constitutes a recapture (p. 12), and the  rules for  requisition  andsalvage  (pp. 14 and 15).  Apparently the German  idea of salvage,  i.c,bringing  or  taking to a place of  safety,  is  theft  pure  and simple, noreceipt being given as for  a  requisition,  and  the  German  vessel  beingthe place of safety.  On the whole, it is not surprising  that the Germans regard this book as one which &quot; must not fall  into the hand of the enemy.&quot;Naval Staff,                                               f    Intelligence Division,             January, 1918.

FOB OFFICIAL USE ONLY.PRINCIPLES OF THE  LAW  GOVERNING  WAR  ON  COMMERCE.      ISSUED BY THE  ADMIRALTY STAFF,  BERLIN, NOVEMBER, 1916.                   Corrected up to  26M May, 1917.                             PREFACE.  This book  is intended  as a  book of  reference, giving as  clearly aspossible a brief exposition of the law governing war on commerce.  Henceit  contains the leading principles  of the Law  of  the  Prize Regulations,supplemented by the addition of those exceptions and limitations which inpresent clay war on commerce have to be observed, owing to the existenceof  spcial treaties,  &amp;c.
  In this last respect only is the work exhaustive.  On the other hand, as far as the Law of the Prize Regulations is con-cerned, this  book  is  naturally  not intended to,  and indeed cannot, takethe  placo of the  Prize Regulations; it meroly  professes to give theirfundamental principles, apart  from what  is more or  less unessential,  byomitting all  those rules, the application of which seldom,  if ever, arises in the present stage of war on commerce.  The aim  of this book is thus to facilitate the application of the PrizeRegulations.  From  the arrangement of tho material, however, it followsnaturally that tho first duty  for every officer engaged in war on commercemust always be to  make a thorough study  of  the  Prize Regulations.Further he  must  take these Regulations themselves as  his basis whenmaking a decision, especially in all cases of difficulty.  For this purpose  reference to the numbers of the Prize Regulationsis  given throughout the  text, eg.  (P.II,  112)                            L-GENERAL.   1. (P.11.  1.) War on  commerce  according to Prize Law may only  be carried on  against enemy or  neutral  merchant  ships  by Commanding Officers of  war vessels.   Officers commanding prizes  do not  possess this right.   2. (P.II.  4, 5, 81-98.) Prize  Law is  enforced by holding up  a  ship  searching her or bringing her into port for examination capture.   The  captured ship may, in certain cases, be destroyed.   See  Articles 23, 33, and 34.   (P.11. 2.)  All ships encountered may be held up  and searched; neutral Government vessels and  neutral vessels  escorted by their own  war-vessels are always exempt from Prize Law.  (P.II.  5.)   For  enemy Government vessels,  see Article 23(6).   3. (P.11, 3.) Prize Law may only be exercised on the High Seas, and not  within  neutral territorial  waters, i.e., within waters which,  for a distance of 3 nautical miles from low water mark, fringe the coast together with the adjacent  islands and bays.   This  includes islands,  if they are not more than  6  nautical miles distant, and bays, if  their  coastline  is ex- clusively in  the possession of neutral States and  their entrance  is not more than C nautical miles wide.   A war vessel may, of oourse,  pass through neutral territorial waters  in order to hold up a  ship outside these limits.   International channels are also neutrahterritorial waters where they are less than 6 nautical miles  wide; this must be  taken into  account  in the case of operations in the Sound.   Should  the ship  be held up just on the edge of  territorial  waters, she should  first  of all  and  without  any  delay be declared  captured,  and her examination should only  be proceeded with after it  has been satisfactorily shown  that  her capture took place outside the territorial limit; should this not have been the case, the  vessel should at once be released.   In this way alone can the ship  be prevented from  escaping into  neutral waters before  she has been declared captured,  and consequently having  to be released.                    II.-HOLDING UP A  SHIP.  4.  If a  ship is to be held up, she should be ordered to stop  by signalsand by blowing the syren.  Ensign and pendant  are to  be  hoisted at latest  When the Signal to Stop is made.   Prior to this the naval ensignneed not be  flown,  and the display of a, mercantile flag or a foreign navalensign  is permissible.   The use  of  a privileged distinguishing  mark, suchas the  flag of  the  Geneva Convention, white flag, or signals of distress  isnot allowed.
  5.  If tlie fillip does not stop when she is signalled to do ao, two rounds oliblank,  and, if necessary,  a live shell, should be fired over her or across!her bows.  As regards the case of submarines, see  Article 42.  (P.II. 83.) If the  ship  still refuses to stop, the  commanding  office!compels her to do SO by  using force.  Force,  however,  may only be  usetuntil the ship abandons  her attempt  to escape.   If the ship is damaged ooven destroyed as a result of the employment of force, she has only  herselto blame and she must  bear the loss.  The ship,  however, may not  sulsequently be destroyed or otherwise  penalised on account  of her attempto escape, but on the contrary she  is then to be treated like  any other neutral or enemy vessel.  Care is to he taken in  determining whether an attempt  has beetmade to escape, e.g. :-     (i) The Commanding Officer  must make certain that the signals  havt          been  understood, especially  if there  is  another ship  in  thi          vicinity.     (ii) Tn  the case of  merchant ships, any increase  in speed is general&apos;;          small  and  barely distinguishable from  a  great distance          merchant vessels ordinarily steam  at full  speed.    (in) Some companies  have  ordered  their ships,  in the  event of tlieii          being held up, not to reverse the engines,  but simply to stop ant          allow the ship to carry her way.  As regards attempts  to escape and active resistance  when held  upsubmarines,  sec  Article 43; as  regards  the  general question, see  aklArticle 25.  6.  (P.It. Si.) When the ship has stopped,  a  boarding party  consistiii]of two officers and  not  more than three  men  is,  if  possible,  to be  sen:on board.   Officers go on  board armed, while the men&apos;s arms  are  left iithe boat.  The boarding  party can  also be  constituted so as to formPrize Crew,  if necessary, see Article 12.  7.  (P.It. 86, 87.)  One of the  officers the  examining officer demands see the ship&apos;s papers and cargo papers, which he goes through.  Repeatsrefusals on the part  of the Master to produce these justifies capture witlout further  formality.  Conversation  with the  crew not  serving any useful purpose  is noto be permitted.  The decision to be taken in respect of the ship and cargo should bbriefly communicated to  the Master, and,  in stating the  reason  of thidecision,  reference  should only  be made to  the orders contained  ithe Prize Regulations.  It must  be  remembered that the enemy and hPress always  distort,   if  possible, the  words  of  German  CommandmOfficers, in order to make capital out of them for use  against  German]herself.      Ill-SEARCH, BRINGING INTO PORT, AND CAPTURE.  8.  (P.B.  88.) Should  the  ship&apos;s papers  disclose nothing of  a  suspicionnature, or the ship herself not be open to suspicion (see Articles 37 and 381she is to be released by the examining officer, after he has obtained tkapproval of  the Commanding Officer,  and  has made an entry in  the ship!log or made out a certificate regarding the result of the search  (see Foil1, p. 20).   Any  complaints  made by  the Master are to be  taken down&apos;writing.  9.  (P.B.  90.)  Suspect ships are to be  searched,  and according  to &apos;result  of  the search,  either released,  brought  into  port,  or  capturSince, however, for military reasons or because of the nature of  the cargsearch can seldom be carried out at sea, it is advisable for suspect shipsonce to be  brought into a German port  in  order to undergo a morjthorough search.  In such cases a ship shall only be declared captured, ifduring her voyage to a German port, it is  necessary to take her throngneutral territorial waters.
   (PJi. 95.) The capture  of  a ship is  effected  hy a communication  in protocol form to  the  Master,  hy  placing a Prize Crew on board  and  by hoisting the naval ensign.  If  it is found impossible to carry out all these formalities, the mere fact of hoisting the naval ensign or the hauling down of tho ship&apos;s colours on the order of the Commanding Officer constitutes the act of capture.   10.  (P.B.  85, 91,  95.) Should anything, for  example, bad weather, pre- vent a boarding party from being sent on  board, a suspect ship  is to  be brought into port without  further  formality.   Should  it  bo necessary  til the same time to  declare such  a ship as captured, she must be ordered  to haul down her flag and to follow the war vessel.   11.  It must be  clearly stated in the Prize Report whether the ship has been captured or  merely  brought  into port for search; in the latter case the reason must be given, for example, whether search was impossible for military reasons or owing to tho nature of the cargo, weather, Ac.        IV-RIGHTS  AND DUTIES OF  THE  PRIZE OFFICER.   12.  (PJi,  106,  107.) A captured ship  will,  as  a general rule,  have a Prize  Crew placed on  board her, the composition and equipment of which is decided on by the Commanding Officer  on the basis of special orders  or according to his own judgment.  It is desirable that the men forming the Prize  Crew should have served in the Mercantile  Marine and be familial&apos; with the customs  of  the Merchant  Service.   13.  (A) The Prize  Officer is in Command.   (P.B. m-131.) The Prize Officer acts as Commanding Officer  of the captured ship, and in this respect he possesses  the same rights and duties as the Commanding Officer of the Avar vessel that has captured the  ship.  He  is responsible for the navigation  of the vessel., The crew, how- ever, must carry out their former duties under  his orders.  As regards the case of a ship to be brought into port, see Article 14.   (B)  Precautions against Attack by the Crew.  Should the crew attempt to regain control of  the ship, he must act with firmness and prevent them from doing so.  In this connection he should,  for example,  have all hatches but one closed  and place a guard over the  hatch left open.  All arms are to be surrendered.  (C)  Action to be taken in case of Resistance.     (a) (PJi. 12&amp;, lO^.) Should the crews of enemy or  neutral ships offer          active or  passive  resistance to the measures authorized under          Prize Law, the most extreme&apos; means of compulsion  are to be          adopted, if necessary, to overcome this resistance.     (b) If the persons participating in such resistance  have not other-          wise been  rendered incapable of doing any further  harm, they          are to be placed under arrest.1     (c) On the delivery of the  vessel in harbour a report is to be handed          in,  apportioning the  blame to the persons concerned.  (D)  Seizure of  Papers.  (PJi. 108.) When the ship has been brought  into port the Prize  Officermust take possession of all papers.  If possible, a list  is to be prepared and  the papers are to  be arranged in order, packed up,  and  sealed (the master&apos;s seal being used).  (E)  Attitude  towards Passengers and Crew.  (P.B, 101).) No special measures are to  be taken in  regard to the pas-passengers and crew on normal occasions.  The authorities will decide to what extent they are to  be given their freedom on arrival in port.
  (F) Removal of Goods.  (T.JR. 127) (a) The Prize Officer, in the presence of the Master and ongiving a receipt,  may take from the cargo, stores,  and provisions, any article which ho may  require  in tho execution of his duty.  (b)  In the case of enemy ships it is desirable  to make the Master of theship taste the food before meals.  14.  In the case of a ship to be brought into port, the Prize Officer doesnot possess the same comprehensive rights.  He  is to take over the naviga-tion of the vessel only in the case of absolute necessity, e.(/., on approaeh-ing tho German coast, or on passing through a minefield only known to himself, &amp;c.  It is advisable merely to give the Master a general order to steer for  a port named, and at the same  time to inform him that he is  responsible forthe navigation of  the ship until the Prize  Officer expressly takes it over.In  other  respects  the rights of  tho Prize Officer  are  confined  to  such measures  as will  prevent the ship from escaping . from  his  control.  Asregards the case of a captured ship,  see Article  13 (A), above.  V.-PROCEDURE  AFTER BRINGING:  THE SHIP  INTO  PORT.  15.  Handing over the  Vessel.  The vessel is to  be handed  over: -    In Cuxhaveni to the Barrage Commandant.    In  Wilhelmshaven  (anchor  in  the  Marientief): to the Captain of        the Port.    In  Kiel,  Swinemtinde, and Zeebrtigge: to the representative of the        Admiralty Staff.    In other  ports: to the representative of the local  Senior  Naval Officer        if there is one, otherwise to the port authorities.                     Vf.-REPORTS REQUIRED.                         Preliminary Remark.  The brief telegraphic report, mentioned below, which is to be substituted for the Prize  Report made by the Commanding  Officer under Prize Regula- tion No. 93, is to  give: the name and type of ship, nationality,  size, time and place of holding up, bringing into port or capture and the reasons for this,  also the name of the ship which has held her  up,  brought her into port  or captured  her.   Example: Russian  S.S. &quot; Dragonera &quot; 4,000  tons, captured August 3rd, off Staberhuk, by S.M.S. &quot;  Stralsund,&quot; signature   ....   16.  The Captured Ship is put in Charge of a Prize Crew.   (P.B. 96).  (a) Prize Report.   .   The form of Prize Report (one copy only) is to be filled  in by the Com- manding Officer and handed  to the Prize Officer for delivery on his arrival in port.  The brief  report made  out as a telegram for the Chief  of the Admiralty  Staff,  in the  form  given above, is  to be handed to the  Prize Officer at the same time.   (b) Report to  Admiralty  Staff.   The telegraphic transmission of this report to the Chief of the Admiralty Staff by the Prize Officer after bringing the ship into port, or by the representative of  the Admiralty Staff,  with the further information that the ship has been brought into port, will  be accepted in this case by the Admiralty  Staff,  both as the Prize Report  of the Commanding  Officer required by No. 96,  and also as the report of the Prize Officer required  by No.  130  of the Prize Regulations.   (This  alteration  in  regard  to No.  ,96 has been made merely in order to relieve  smaller vessels,  engaged in war on commerce in home waters, of the necessity of filling in a second form of Prize Report.)
   (c) The following must be handed in on Delivery of the Ship in Port.      (i) Prize Report.     (ii) Copy of telegram in accordance with (b)  above.     (iii) Ship&apos;s papers with the list of them  signed by the Prize  Officer           and if possible by the Master.     (iv) Report on  the type, number, origin and  destination of any Mail           Bags (tho examination  authority makes the regulation  report           to  the  Admiralty Staff).   Mailbags containing  Letters  (in-           eluding printed  matter) are to be  handed  over in port un-           opened,  even if they are  of  enemy origin  or  for  an  enemy           destination.   Parcel  Post   is  to  be  treated  as   cargo,   ,        see Article 35.     (v) Any  special reports,  such as grounds of  suspicion against the           crew, reports on resistance offered, &amp;c.   (d) Routine reports to the local  naval authorities.   17. Bringing a  Ship into Port  for  the Purpose of  Closer Examina- tion, without Capture having been effected.   (a) Prize Report.   The form of Prize Report, duly filled in, is to  be given by the Commaud- ing  Officer to  the Prize Officer, for delivery on  arrival of the ship in port.   (6) Report  to Admiralty  Staff.   This is unnecessary if the ship is to be delivered  to a representative of the  Admiralty Staff, since  it is his duty to make the report.   (c) As in 16 (c) above.   (d) As in 16 (d) above.  &apos; 18. The  Ship, after capture, is again released.   (P.R. 97.)  (a) Prize Report and Report to Admiralty Staff.   The brief telegraphic report should be  made  in  the  form  given above, and  the form of Prize Report, duly filled in, should be transmitted as soon as possible  to the Chief of the Admiralty Staff.   (b) As in 16(d).   19. The  Ship is held up, searched and immediately released, but the Master makes Complaints.   (a) (P.11. 89, 92) Prize Report and Report  to  Admiralty Staff.  The telegraphic report should be made as above,  also the form of Prize Report, duly filled in, -should be transmitted without delay to the Chief of the  Admiralty Staff  together with  the  written  complaints of the Master, to wliich should be  added  the  observations  of the Commanding Officer, likewise in writing.  (ft) As in 16(d).  20. Ship or Goods are destroyed.  (PJI. 128.)  (a) Prize Report  and Report to  Admiralty  Staff.  A  telegraphic Report (as directed in P.R.  123,  paragraph  2) should be rendered, and  the  form of  Prize Report, complete in every &quot;detail,  should be transmitted as  soon as possible to the Chief of  the Admiralty  Staff, together with  all the evidence (ship&apos;s papers, &amp;c).  (b) As  in 16(d).  21. Confiscation of Goods without the capture  of the  Ship.  (P.B. 122.)  (a) Prize Report  to  Admiralty Staff.  Telegraphic  report should be rendered as above, and the  form of  Prize Report, duly filled in, should be transmitted on the  delivery of the  goodsin port.  (6) As in 16(d).
                        VII.-ENEMY SHIPS.  22. An enemy ship is one which  is entitled to fly an  enemy Hag.  Theright to fly the enemy flag appears in the ship&apos;s papers  which every shipmust carry on board.   The contents of  these  papers  alone  determine the point, not the fact which may  sometimes be known to the Coiniiiand-ing Officer, that the owner .is a subject of an enemy State, unless  at thotime  proof is forthcoming that the  ship&apos;s  papers have been falsified.  Should  no  documents be found from which the nationality of the shipcan be definitely  established, she may  be treated as an enemy vessel.  23. (P.B. 10, 112.) (a) An enemy ship is unable to capture.  She may be destroyed, if it appears inexpedient or unsafe to bring her into port.  The cargo,  or its jmrt of origin  or destination, is not to be  taken intoconsideration  as no compensation  need be paid for anything on  hoard.The  whole  cargo shares  in every respect  the  fate  of  the  vesseldestroyed.  An enemy ship  may, therefore, also be destroyed when sheis proceeding merely from one neutral port to another.  (P.B. 123.) The  ship&apos;s papers, and  especially cargo papers,  should, henv-ever ,  if possible be removed and sent together with the Prize Report direct to the Admiralty Staff.  (Sec Form 2, p.  20.)  (r)) Enemy Government Ships come under  the  laws  of  war withoutfurther  formality,  i.e.,  the Prize Court has not to decide whether theirsinking  or capture was legally justified.  But they may not be Sunk as amatter  of course  or without  warning, unless  they are war  vessels ortroop transports.  Government ships,  other than war-vessels, are shipsused  for  Government  purposes and  ships  under Government command,besides all ships which are the property  of the State.  In  all such  cases, however, Prize  Reports  are  to be prepared and trans-mitted direct to the Admiralty Staff.VIII.-NEUTRAL  SHIPS WHICH ARE REGARDED  AS  OP  ENEMY                            CHARACTER.  24.  (P.B. 12, 15.) A  ship which  has  been transferred from an enemy to a neutral  flag since the outbreak of war is to be treated as an enemyvessel,  unless the Commanding Officer  is  convinced that  the transferwould have been made even had the Avar not broken out; for example, intho way of inheritance.  In other respects,  where a  transfer of flag is inquestion, the  provisions of Prize Regulations Nos. 10-15, are to be applied,  Former German ships, condemned as  prizes in an enemy country and afterwards sold to &quot;neutrals, are liable to capture as the transfer of  flagtook  place after the outbreak of Avar.  These ships,  if possible, should bebrougl t into port.   If this is impossible they may be destroyed.   Sec, how-ever, Recapture, under  Article 26.  25. (P.B. 16, h,  S3.)  A neutral is to be  treated as an enemy ship if sheoffers active  resistance to the measures authorised under Prize&apos; Law,  An attempt to escape does not  in itself constitute active resistaace;it justifies, hoAvever, the application of force until the ship desists from such attempt.   See, however, Article 5, p. 5.  An attempt to escape rendersthe ship suspect and therefore justifies her being captured  and broughtinto port without further  formality.  If, hoAvever, the ship is not liable toconfiscation on other grounds for example, on account of carrying contra-band or rendering assistance contrary to  the laAvs of neutrality,  she maynot be sunk for attempting to  escape, nor, if it  is impossible to bring herinto  port, may any other disadvantages be imposed upon her by Avay of punishment.  Active resistance does not  only  consist,  hoAvever,  in  the  ship herselfoffering direct and  active resistance to  capture, such  as firing on,  orattempting to ram the Avar-vessel.   It is constituted just as much by theship held up summoning the assistance of hostile  war-vessels in the vicinityand causing them to attack the German  Avar-vessel in order to facilitate anescape.  Ordinary  Avireless signals  of distress (S.O.S.) do not constitutesuch  resistance; Avireless messages&apos;must  be  intended  to summon  hostiloforces.
  is  regards attempts to escape and the offering of active resistance whenheld up by submarines, see Article 43.  26.  As regards unneutral Service by a neutral  ship, see  Prize  Itegula-jjions  Nos. 48-50.  The most important case is that referred to in Prize Regulation No.55 (c), where &quot; the neutral ship is chartered by the Enemy Government.&apos;-The ship herself must be definitely chartered by the enemy Government.It is  not enough, therefore, for a neutral  ship to be conveying  a  cargointended  for  the enemy  Government, nor  for tho  neutral ship  to  bechartered by a private firm, unless it  is plainly proved at  the same time that the private firm is acting only as a cover.                       IX-NEUTRAL SHIPS.  27.  Neutral ships aro those which are entitled tolly the flag of a neutral State (compare Article  22, p.  9).  28.  Neutral  ships,  so far as they  do not  come  under  the head of &quot;Vessels not  open  to Suspicion&quot;  (see Articles 37, 38), are  subject to the regulations  concerning  tho Law  of   Contraband, Blockade  Law, Unneutral Service, and Convoy.  for the Law of Blockade, sec Prize Regulations Nos.  57-80.  As  regards &quot;Unneutral Service, see  Prize Regulations Nos.  48-50  (sec Article 26 above).  As regards Convoy, see Prize Regulation  No. 5.  As regards  Contraband, see  following Articles 29^34.  29.  Contraband consists only of such articles as are included in the list of contraband,  and, in addition, are suspected of being  for  an enemy destination.   Both conditions must BE fulfilled. The principles of contraband,  therefore, do not  apply if, for example,  the  article in question is included in the list of contraband but is not suspected of being for an enemy destination, or if articles are found which are not on the list but are destined for the enemy.  In  the case  of contraband  it is immaterial whether it is enemy or neutral  property, but an article  must never be treated as contraband  merely because it is enemy property.  In  addition, the suspicion of enemy destination must  not be  con- tradicted by  OTHER  Circumstances.  For example, a ship is encountered carrying a cargo of wheat &quot; for a neutral Government or to the order of this Government.&quot;   (The Bill  of  Lading, for  instance, runs as  follows: unto  the  Dutch  Government and to his or their assigns.)   Among the ship&apos;s papers,  however, is  found a  reliable declaration by the  neutral Government, stating  that they  are already the owners of the wheat.  In such  case there certainly exists a suspicion  of  enemy  destination  on the strength of  the Bill  of  Lading &quot; To  order.&quot;  But this suspicion  is con- tradicted  by another  circumstance, namely,  by the fact that the  neutral Government is also  the owner,  and it  must  therefore be assumed that the wheat is destined only f oiv the neutral Government.  For exception,  see Article 31.  30. (PJI.  21, 28.)   Eor lists of contraband arranged alphabeticallyand with remarks, see  Appendix.&quot;&apos;  31. Suspicion of  enemy destination.  (PAL 30,  32, 83.) In this respect, as a general rule, there IS  no longer any difference between absolute and relative contraband as far as thedecision of  the Commanding  Officer is concerned.  He may assume an enemy destination in the case  of any  prohibitedarticle:   (o) If the prohibited article is destined  for and is directly en route         to  an enemy country,  irrespective of  the person   or  the         authority there to whom it  is consigned  and irrespective  of         whether it  is to order or not.   (I) If the  prohibited article is consigned to order, or to some  con-         Signee not defined  in the papers  (for  example, a shipping         agent), no  matter where the consignment is en route to.* Not reproduced-Tr.
    (c) If tho prohibited article is consigned to, and is en route to, an          enemy country, via  neutral territory, whether  it be consigned          to  a person or to some authority in the enemy country.    (d) If the prohibited article is addressed to a  person established in          a neutral country,  but this person is an agent or dealer for          the enemy  Government,  or  has  supplied  prohibited  goods          directly or indirectly by an enemy country during the war.  The names of  agents, dealers and persons mentioned  under (d) will be,as heretofore, communicated  in the Secret  Information  under  I.  ThoCommanding Officer can, however, go beyond  this information, if,  in anyparticular case,  he possesses proofs against a person to whom prohibitedgoods are consigned.  (P.B. 30.)  In  addition to the above principles, the following  must b3noted in the case of absolute  contraband; should the ship touch at anenemy port before arriving at  her neutral port  of destination,  the enemydestination of the absolute contraband is  fully established,  even if itis proved by other circumstances that the goods  are  not, in fact, intended for the enemy.  Example: If,  in the case  mentioned above under Article 29, saltpetrehad been shipped instead of wheat, the saltpetre would  be liable to seizureunder  any circumstances.             X.-DESTRUCTION OF  A NEUTRAL SHIP.  32.  (P.11. Jflt  2.) Contraband is liable to confiscation and seizure.  the carrying  of contraband can,  however, at  the  same time result  in  the seizure of  the ship.  A  ship  with  contraband on  board is,  therefore,according to  the  regulations, to be captured and brought in.  There canbe no question of the destruction of  the  ship or contraband, except underthe conditions laid down  in Articles 33  and 34, p.  12.  33.  (P.11.  113.)  The destruction of.a  neutral ship is permissible only if both of the following conditions are fulfilled:      (a) If in bringing her into port the war-vessel  is exposed to danger,          or the  success  of  the operations  in  which  she is  engaged is          thereby imperilled; this condition obtains, for  instance,  if tiro          war-vessel cannot  spare sufficient  men to form  a Prize Crew,          or if &quot;the neutral ship cannot  follow the  Avar-vessel, or  if the          presence of hostile forces in the vicinity  causes apprehensions          of  her recapture.    (h) If  the   ship  is   liable  to  seizure,   because the   contraband          as  reckoned by  value, or weight, or volume, or freight dues,          amounts to  more than half  the  cargo (P.B.  .1,1).  Not only must  both conditions be  fulfilled, but  the commanding officer must expressly state in the Prize Report that they did obtain.  (PJi.  115.) If  the first condition was  not  fulfilled, compensation wouldhave to be paid  for the ship and the  Avhole cargo,  regardless  of Avhetherthey Avere or AArere not liable to seizure.   If the first condition Avas fulfilledbut not tho second, compensation would  have to be paid in any case, notonly for the  ship, but also  for the whole portion of  the neutral cargoAvhich was  not liable to seizure.  Special care should on that  account be taken in appraising the value in accordance With paragraph (b); in cases where it  is doubtful if that part of the cargo AAdiich  is not contraband does not exceed that  portionwhich may be contraband (see  Article  29,  p. 10)f all articles in the cargoAvhich are not definitely known to he  contraband,  must be omitted fromthe appraisement.  For example, the following should not be  regardedas undoubted contraband:  Machinery, machinery  parts,  iron, iron ores,iron tubes,  steel  tubes,  &amp;c,  unless  it  has been  ascertained  that  these general terms serve merely to cover actual contraband, e.g., tool machineryfor the manufacture of Avar material, raw material for shells, raw haematiteiron,  haematite iron ore, Ac.  (P.B. 123.) Ship&apos;s papers and especially cargo papers should always be secured and &quot;transmitted&apos;, together with tire Prize Report, direct to theAdmiralty staff,   (See Form 8, p. 22.)
XL-DESTRUCTION  OF CONTRABAND  WHEN A NEUTRAL  SHIP                           IS RELEASED.  34.  (PJi.  121.) If the ship  is not liable  to seizure in conformity with article 33 (b), the surrender of the contraband may be demanded, andthe contraband itself destroyed, if  the conditions of Article 33 (a) apply ;the neutral ship is at the same time to be released  Tho  cargo papers,  referring to  that  portion  of the  cargo which hasbeen destroyed, should be secured and transmitted direct to the AdmiraltyStaff, together with the Prize  Report.                      XII-POSTAL  MATTER.  35. Tho treatment  of postal matter is governed  by the  followingrules:      (a) Parcel Post is to be treated as cargo,  and is therefore subject to          the conditions laid  down  in the Prize  Regulations regarding          contraband.    (b) Letter  Post.&quot; Postal  correspondence found at sea is inviolable.          This  applies also  to Russian  postal matter, Prize Regulation          No. 7 notwithstanding.   Letter post includes printed matter.,    (c) As &quot;regards postal matter in  ships  brought in, sec Article 1C (c),          p.  8.    ((/) The  luggage,  letters  and  other documents carried by an enemy          courier are not to be regarded as postal  matter, but should, on          the contrary, always be confiscated.                        XII I.-RECAPTURES.  36.  (PJi.  98.) Recaptures arc ships taken from  the enemy by german naval forces, which the  enemy himself  had previously  captured on thegrounds of  the  laws  of  prize or contraband,  but as  regards which no decision had  as yet been pronounced in the enemy Prize Court,  Any  such  ship  is only to  be treated as an enemy ship,  if the enemyemploys her  for belligerent purposes.  In all other cases the  ship may becaptured  and destroyed only if she is liable to capture and destruction by german forces according to the provisions of our Prize Regulations,   Theship is, therefore, to be treated in the same way as any other ship thatis held up.  Prizes  already  condemned by  the  enemy  Prize Court  are enemy ships and are to be treated as such.  See  also Article 24, p.  10.           XIV.-VESSELS  NOT  OPEN  TO  SUSPICION.  37. Preliminary Remark:-The  following provisions hold good onlyoutside the  barred zones unless the contrary is expressly stated.   Withinthe barred zones all sea-borne traffic will be dealt with in accordance withthe declaration regarding these zones.  Vessels not open to suspicion  may be  held up  and searched, but,wherever they are  encountered,  they must be  allowed a director  passage to their  port of  destination, when once  it has been established thatthey are  not open to suspicion.  Should  there  be in  any particular case  some  well founded suspicion that .the certificates  mentioned in Article 38, below, have been falsified or are being  misused, the  ship is to be Jbrought  into port.  Should this beimpossible, the certificate produced is to be removed, together with  thoseship&apos;s and cargo papers from  which  the suspected falsification or misusemay afterwards  be  proved.  Such  a ship may only be destroyed if the commanding Officer has complete proof of the falsification  and if theship cannot  be brought  in.
* This order is not available.-Tr.38.  (l&apos;.ll. 6.) Tho following ships are not open to suspicion:    (a) Hospital ships,  inside and outside tho barred zones, except:               (i)  inside the area bounded by the line Flaniborough  Head                  to  Terschelling on the ono  side and  the lino Ushant                  to  Land&apos;s End  on tho other;            (ii)  in the   Mediterranean,  where   Order  0   is  to   be                  folio wed. *  (6) Vessels employed exclusively in coastal fisheries, or smaller vessels        carrying out  local services, as long as they  take no  part  what-        ever in  hostilities.   Coastal  fisheries  do not include  high  sea        fisheries.  In  dealing with the  latter, proceed in  accordance        with Order 0, especially in regard to the Norwegian, Dutch        and Spanish high sea fisheries.  (c) Neutral vessels  in possession of a Swedish,  Danish, or Norwegian        guarantee form.   (See Form 4, p. 23.)  (d) Neutral vessels  with timber cargoes from Swedish ports, provided        they have the certificates on  board  required by  the Special        Agreement with Sweden, under XVIII. A., p. 16.  (e) Neutral vessels  which  produce  a  German pass allowing them a        free passage  to  their port  of  destination (for example,  one        issued by the representative of the Admiralty Staff), see Special        Agreement, Regulations for traffic in the  Sound,   &amp;c,  under        XVIII.  C, p. 17.  (/) Neutral vessels  carrying food  supplies  of  Danish origin  direct        from Danish to British  ports,  sec  Special Agreement with        Denmark under XVIII. B., p. 16.

D., p. 18, particularly the list of articles        regarded as war  material.     (ii) Neutral  vessels encountered  outside the barred zones  on        their way  to the U.S.A. are to be treated in  accordance with        Special  Regulation No. 1, under XIX, Memoranda, p. 19.  (h) (i) Spanish  ships proceeding from  Spain or  the  Canary Islands        to French  ports  outside the barred  zone,  or  French Morocco        outside  the barred  zone, provided they have on board a safe&apos;        conduct from tho  German Embassy or  a German Consulate        showing that their  cargo is composed exclusively of fruit.     (ii) Spanish  ships  outside  the barred zones proceeding to  the        U.S.A., provided they have on  board a safe-conduct from  the        German Embassy or a German  Consulate  showing that their        cargo consists exclusively of fruit of any kind  (fresh, dried, or        preserved), olive oil, wine,  cork (cork-wood, raw and worked,        cork bark, cork meal).            It  is  expressly  stated in the safe conduct that this  ceases        to be valid if the ship enters the  German barred zones.     (iii) Neutral  ships outside the barred zones proceeding from  Spain        to  French ports situated to the  westward of &quot; Le  Point  de        1&apos;Espiquette,&quot; and outside the  barred zone, provided that             (a)  the cargo is destined for the Swiss  Government;            (b)  the  Spanish Government  guarantees  that  the  ships                  contain no cargo for  Germany&apos;s enemies;            (c)  there  is  a  certificate  on  board  from  the  German                  Embassy or a  German Consulate showing that  the                  conditions laid down in&apos;(a) and  (b) have been com-                  plied with.              - ,  (?&apos;) Vessels specially indicated by  name.

(?n)  Tho Dutch Government  vessel which enters the barred zone  every          Thursday for the purpose of supplying the North Hinder Light-          ship (see Special Regulation No. 2, under XIX.  Memoranda,          p. 19).               XV.-THE RIGHT  OF REQUISITION.                   A.  Outside  the Barred Zones.  30.  (P.B.  110.) German war vessels may,  in  case of necessity,  remove from  the cargo, stores,  and provisions for their use and consumption     (a)  in the  case of  enemy ships: any article;    (b)  in the  case of  neutral ships: articles  which are  contraband (see          Article 25, p. 10) or which the Master hands over voluntarily          or in return  for payment, or  which are salved in  accordance          with Article  40.  Private property is  not to be touched under  any circumstances andthe same applies to the ship&apos;s  ensign.  A list of articles removed  mustbe appended to the Prize Report; if possible  the Master should  be  given a form of receipt.                   B. Within  the Barred Zones.  The same  principles apply as in the case of A, except that from neutral ships, only such articles may be removed and only such quantities of  these as are absolutely necessary  for continuing the  cruise.  The list of  articles  removed should he transmitted to the AdmiraltyStaff  through the official channels.                   A.  Outside the Barred Zones.  40.  Any  articles may be salved even  though  there may not  be any immediate need of them,  subject, however,  to the following limitations:    (a) Private property  and the ship&apos;s ensign  are not to  be touched.    (b) Any articles salved,  which have not subsequently been expended          as the need arose, should be handed over together with a list          to the  competent authorities in harbour.  The Prize  Report          must contain a reference to the salvage.                   B.  Within  the Barred Zones.  With the  exception of articles  removed in accordance with Article 39,nothing must be salved from neutral ships.   Any articles may be salvedfrom enemy ships, but in this case also  the provisions of  Articles 39  mustbe observed.                   Notes to Articles 39  and  40,  The Right of Requisition and Salvage should  be exercised in such a manner  as not to wound  the national susceptibilities of neutrals or to afford justification for reproaches directed against the crew of the german war-vessel.  Instances  have occurred  where articles have been wrapped  up in theensign;  chests,  &amp;c. are  also said  to have  been ruthlessly  broken  open inthe presence of the shipfs  crew.   Such  a thing must on no account occuragain.  Provisions and equipment of lifeboats must not  be touched.                       XVL-SUBIORINES.                   m  41.  Submarines are to be guided in the  first  instance by the specialorders which they receive. -  If they are waging war on commerce in accordance with the Prize Regu-lations,  they are to observe  the foregoing  articles, except in so far asArticles 42 and 43 below permit them to  adopt a different procedure.
  42. When holding up  a ship, submarines, instead of firing blank rounds, may at mice firo live shells across her bows, as lit is generally impossible to see bland rounds at any great distance (see also Article 5, p. 5).  (I&apos;M. si,)  Submarines have the right  to  order the Ship&apos;s Papers of a vessel held up to  be  brought alongside in a boat. Prize regulation. No. 81 no  longer applies in the case of submarines.  43.-Holding up, Examination, &amp;c.  (a) (P.R. 112.) If  it is established without doubt that the ship held up is an enemy vessel and  she  cannot be brought in, a  search of the ship-is unnecessary.   She can simply be informed by signal that within  a reason- able time  the crew  must abandon her with the papers.   After  being abandoned  the ship  is  to bo sunk.   When the Commanding Officer  hasSatisfied himself that his order has been understood, but nevertheless the crew have not obeyed it, he will compel them  to do so by using force.  (J&apos; 11. 123.)  If possible the ship&apos;s papers and  cargo papers should after- wards bo secured.  (b) (P.11. 123.) In  the case of a neutral  ship the ship&apos;s  papers andcargo papers should be examined when brought alongside, before anyfurther action is taken.  If the Commanding Officer is satisfied that hisorder  to bring the ship&apos;s papers alongside has been  understood, but it isnot complied with  by the  neutral ship, he is justified in threatening  touse force.  If the neutral ship still fails  to obey, she is to be  considered as offerng active resistance and consequently to be  treated as an enemy vessel,provided  that the  Commanding  Officer  has satisfied himself  that  the refusal to obey orders can not be due to  a misunderstanding.  NOTE. lt has happened that when, after  holding up a  ship, the sub- marine has dived in order to approach nearer to. her, submerged, the shiphas resumed  her voyage because she  concluded from  the disappearance of the submarine that she herself had been released. In such cases it should not be regarded as an attempt to escape unless the Commanding Officer has informed the ship of his intention.  The-fact alone of the ship proceeding away can  never be regarded as active  resistance.  See also  Articles 25 and 5, pp.  10 and 5.   XVII-TREATMENT  OP  CREWS OP SHIPS  ENCOUNTERED.  44.  (a) Enemy subjects may  be removed from any ship  held up, and made prisoners.  (This naturally applies to men  only.)  Prize Regulations Nos. 100-103  no longer apply to enemy subjects.  An exception is made  in the case of Japanese  and Italians.  They are tobe treated  in accordance with the Prize Regulations.  It is desired that at least  the  Master and the Chief Engineer of enemy ships  should be brought in.  A neutral ship, however,  should not be brought in merely because  she has enemy  subjects on board. This should  only be done if the transport of enemy subjects is such as to constitute unneutral service in  the sense ofPrize Regulations Nos. 47 to 55.  (b)  (P.E. UJO-108.)  Neutral  subjects   should, as   a  general rule, beallowed to  go free.   If, however,  the  neutral ship has  offered activeresistance (sec Article 25, p. 10, and Prize Regulation No. 160),  or if she has participated directly in hostilities (Prize  Regulation No. 83A), thocrew should be made  prisoners.  45.  Prisoners brought into port in accordance with Article 44  are to be handed over on arrival in harbour.   The Senior Naval Officer and theAdmiralty  Staff should be informed without  delay, in order that adecision may be reached as  to  the future disposal of the prisoners.                 XVIII.-SPECIAL AGREEMENTS.          A. SWEDISH  TIMIIBR  ExrofiT.-TIMBER AGREEMENT.  I. Neutral Ships leaving Swedish ports  with cargoes of timber and pro-ceeding to neutral ports or to such enemy ports as lie outside the barredzones  (sec,  however,  under  II.) may pass  freely  notwithstanding thoprovisions of the Prize Regulations,  if they have on board the followingcertificates:
    I, A certificate  from the Swedish Customs at  the port of departure,          stating that :              (a)  the cargo of timber is solely of Swedish origin;              (b)  the cargo does not contain fire-wood, pit-props,  or  any                    other article  regarded  as  contraband.   (See Form 5,                    P- 24-)    2. An  affidavit from the  shipping company showing that the  ship is          really bound for the port outside the barred zone specified in          the ship&apos;s  papers and will discharge there.    3. In the case of  a European port of destination, an affidavit from tho          consignee,  if necessary, transmitted telegraphically, stating that          the consignment will not be forwarded to the barred zone.  For the certificates specified  under 2 and 3,  corresponding  guaranteedeclarations given by a  neutral Government on behalf of the shippers orthe consignees may be substituted.  Cargoes  of timber for Norway must have  a Guarantee Declarationfrom the Norwegian Government  instead of  the certificates  mentionedunder 3.  If  this is not on board the cargoes are to be dealt  with in  accord-ance  with  the Prize Regulations.  A German  pass may be issued in place of one or all of these certificates.  II. This Timber Agreement does not apply to neutral ships eneoun-tered  inside  the  barred  zones;  nor  does  it apply to  neutral shipsencountered outside these zones, if they are bound for enemy ports lyingWithin a  barred zone.  The  latter ships will be dealt with in accordancewith  the Prize Regulations, whilst the former will be attacked  in  accord-ance  with  the barred zone declaration.    B.  DANISH  EXPORT  OF FOOD  STUFFS. FOOD-STUFFS AGREEMENT.  Neutral ships with foodstuffs of Danish  origin, proceeding direct fromDanish to English ports, are to be allowed to pass freely in  the North Seaoutside the barred  zones.  The export of food-stuffs of Danish origin  to England  by an indirectroute,  or  to countries  other than  England, and  the export to  anycountries  of food-stuffs not of Danish origin is to be dealt  with in  accord-ance  with  the Prize Regulations.

The Prusso-American Treaty of  1785, 1799 and 1828 is  to be inter-preted as follows until further notice:      (a) American  Merchant  Ships laden with contraband, which is not          war material  in the sense of the list given under (b), are to be          allowed to continue their voyage  unmolested.    (6) American merchant ships  with war  material  on board are liable          to be brought into port, captured  or destroyed, if the war          material, as  reckoned by value,  weight, volume  or freight dues,          amounts to  more than half the  cargo (see  Prize Regulation          No. 47).  If this is  not the case, the part of the cargo forming          the war material may naturally be thrown overboard.
       The term  &quot; War  Material &quot; is to be considered  as  covering      the following articles:            (i) Arms of all kinds, including sporting weapons,  together               with  their component parts,  where these are recog-               nisable as such.          (ii) Projectiles,  explosive  charges  and  cartridges  of  all               kinds, together with  their component parts, where               these are recognisable as such.         iiii) Gunpowder  and explosives specially intended for use in               war.         (ix) Gun mountings, ammunition wagons, limbers, provision               wagons,  field forges, together with their component               parts, where these are recognisable as such.          (v) Military clothing  and equipment which can  be recog-               nised as such.          (vi) Military  apparatus   of  all   kinds whteh  can   be               recognised as such.         (vii) Saddle, draught, and  pack  animals which  can  be used               for war  purposes.        (viii) Camp equipment and  its component  parts,  where these               are  recognisable as such.          (ix) Armour plates.          (x) War ships and other war-vessels, and  such parts of them               as,  owing to  their special  properties,  can  oidy be               used  in  a war-vessel.          (xi) Tools and  appliances used exclusively for the manufac-               ture  of  war material, or for the manufacture  and               repair of arms and naval or military war  material.         (xii) Airships  and  aeroplanes.        (xiii) Motor cars.*(c)  It should b&apos;e ascertained in all cases whether any transfer of  flag      has taken place during the war. If, under Prize  Regulations      Nos. 12 to 15, it is  not necessary to recognise such transfer, the      ship is to be treated like any  other neutral ship held up.id)  As compensation must always be paid when American  property      on  board American ships is  destroyed (to  this extent only is      the Treaty binding), it is necessary to determine  as  carefully      as possible  whether  the compensation to  be paid is in  just      proportion  to the damage inflicted on the enemy.(e)  Vessels in the service of the Belgian Relief Commission, Rotter-      dam, whatever their nationality, have free passage  to their  port      of destination,  if they  bear the prescribed markings and have a      German safe conduct on board.    Markings:      In  addition to  the ensign, a white flag  with  the inscription    &quot; Commission  Belgian Relief, Rotterdam  &quot;  in  red, and  a similar    inscription on  the ship&apos;s  sides.    Safe  Conducts:      For the  voyage to Rotterdam,  on condition that the ship&apos;s    cargo is exclusively for  the Relief Commission, safe  conducts are    issued by         (a) Tlie Swiss Minister in Washington or the Swiss Consul-              General  in Montreal for   ships  sailing  from  North              American ports.        (b) The German  Minister  in  Buenos Aires for  ships sailing              from the Argentine.        (c) The German Minister at the Hague for ships whose cargo              has  been  purchased  afloat  by  the Relief  Commission,            .  for  the voyage from  the British  port  of  call to  Rot-              terdam.      Safe conducts for the return voyage from Rotterdam are issued    by  the German  Minister  at the Hague  on  condition  that  the    ships have  no  cargo for England on board.      All safe  conducts contain the  notation  that they are only valid    outside the barred zones.
                        XIX.-MEMORANDA.                      Special Regulation No. 1.  Until further notice the U.S.A. are to be regarded as a neutral countryin the sense of the Prize Regulations.  Imports are therefore to  be  dealtwith in accordance with  the Prize Regulations.  But,  in  order to prevent the growth of American war industries, thefollowing rule is laid down:    In doubtful cases,  the  assumption  mentioned  in  Prize  RegulationNo.  31,  paragraph 2  (b) Consignment to a  person  who  has  deliveredcontraband to an enemy  country during the war is always  to be adoptedin the case of  articles included under Prize Regulation No. 21, (1), (2), (3),or of the  following metals or their ores  (including pyrites) : haematiteraw  iron,  copper,  tin,  zinc,  lead,   nickel,  wolfram,  vanadium   and.manganese.                      Special Regulation No. 2.  Every  Thursday  the Dutch  Government  sends a Government vesselfrom Flushing into the barred zone for the purpose of provisioning theNorth Hinder Lightship.  The  vessel  is to proceed by day  only.  She  has only one mast.  from july 1st the vessel will bear the following markings:    &quot; The name 1 Vlissingen &apos; on both sides,  amidships.  The  Dutch ensignpainted on both sides, forward and aft, and extending from the deck tothe water-line. At the mast-head,  a blue flag with a jack, white and redhorizontal, in the upper corner  next  the  mast.  An  extra large Dutchensign  at the ensign staff.

The ship is an enemy vessel (Prize Raguhtion No. 11); she is liable  to ciptureand seizure (Prize Regulation No.  17),  and, as it is impossible  for S.M.

With reference to His Majesty&apos;s Order of 9 January 1917 :  (1)  From  1  February  1917  onwards,  every  enemy merchant vesselencountered within the  barred area is  to be attacked without  delay.Hospital ships bearing the prescribed markings are excepted from this rule,provided they are encountered outside the area  bounded  by  the  lines:Ushant Lands End, and Flamborough Head Terschelling; also hospital ships  encountered within the  last-mentioned area  up to  midnight of3-4 February.  Neutral steamers, Belgian Relief ships  and unarmed enemy  passengersteamers are to be dealt with in accordance with the Prize Regulations upto midnight of 6-7 February within the barred area in the North Sea, and up to  midnight of 12-13 February in the rest of the barred area;  from thenonwards, they are to be treated as enemy ships  within the whole  of thebarred area.  Neutral sailing vessels are to he dealt with according to the Prize Regu-lations up to midnight of 10-11 February within  the barred area  of theNorth Sea, and up to midnight  of 28 February-1  March in the rest of thebarred area.  (2)  Outside the barred area,  unarmed, merchant vessels are to be dealtwith according to the Prize Regulations.   Armed  merchant vessels  are tobe attacked without delay.  (3)  In order to intimidate neutral shipping, it is most important that the initial effect produced shall he as striking as possible.  Later on;&apos;  it is moreimportant that the  stations in  the barred area shall be occupied as con-tinuously as possible.  (4)  The  operational area of the Naval Corps is bounded to the Eastwardby the line Flamborough Head Terschelling Lightship.  The dividing line between the two operational areas in the West will bearranged between the Commaiider-in-Chief of the High  Sea  Fleet and theNaval Corps  according to requirements,  particularly as  regards miningoperations.

The following communication has been  received from the AdmiraltyStaff:    (1) The bringing in of prizes is urgently  desired,  if the undermen-          tioned  metals, raw  materials,  &amp;c, are  contained  in any^ con-          siderable   quantities  in  the  cargo: Gold,  platinum,   nickel,          wolfram,  vanadium, molybdenum,  chrome,  copper,  tin, quick-          silver, antimony, rubber and balata of any kind, asbestos, wool,          cotton, fabrics of bast fibre (hemp, jute, flax, ramie) and their          products  (textiles of every kind,  cordage, &amp;c),  vegetable and          animal fats and oils of every kind.

Reference:  Admiralty Staff,  A 1119  0 I, of 12.1.17;  Instructions forcarrying out His Majesty&apos;s Order of 9.1.17; Admiralty Staff A 1119 0  I, of12.1.17, Par. 3.  The following has been arranged as to the limits of the operational areasof submarines of the High Sea Forces  and those of the Naval Corps:(a) For Mining Operations.  The operational area of the Naval Corps is bounded     to the W., by the meridian of 70 W.    to the N., by the parallel of 560 N.    to the S.,  by the  parallel of  45o20&apos; N. (to the Southward  of the      Gironde).  Mines will only be laid  inside a 3-mile limit round the coast, except inthe case of the Royal  Sovereign and  Owers Lightships,  the areas roundwhich (to  a distance of 3  miles) must  also be considered  as infested  withmines.  Important points for  making a landfall, in particular Ushant, the Scillies,and further, the channel  between the  Scillies and Lands End, will remainfree from  mines.*(b) For Work  with Torpedoes and Guns.  Submarines of the High Sea Forces occupy, in  the  first place:      The area  between the Scillies and Ireland......  Area  A      The French Coast south of Lat. 45o20&apos; N.......  Area  B      The North Channel    .........     ......  Area  Cin the second place:                                . ,      The Western exit from the English Channel between        the Scillies and Ushant     ..........    ...  Area  D  Submarines belonging to the Naval Corps occupy in the first place:  The English Channel up to a  line between the Scillies and TJshant,  andthe French Coast as far as the Gironde.                                               (signed)    BAUER.
    (2)  Further,  the bringing in of a ship  is desirable when considerable          quantities of  the under-mentioned objects are  on board:            Foodstuffs and fodder,  leather and  bides,  arms, shells,  gun-          powder and explosives, and products suitable for their manu-          facture; war material of every kind, stepl and iron wire, barbed          wire;  implements suitable for the manufacture  of  arms and          ammunition and  war  material; industrial  machinery and tool          machinery of every kind; all ores; aluminium, zinc,  lead; iron          alloys; sheet-iron and steel for the construction of ships; resin,          colophony, mineral oils (lubricating oils, oil fuel,  gas oil,  &amp;c).          Admiralty Staff B. 96  I  of 7.1.17.  II.  In connexion with the above, attention is  again drawn to the Orderof the Commander-in-Chief  of the  High Sea Fleet G. 7739  A4 of 1.12.16.As laid down in this Order, it is usually inadvisable to bring in ships whichare held up beyond the line of patrols to  the North of England, as there isconsiderable  chance of the  prize being lost.  On the other hand,  it is always advisable  to bring in ships held  up  in the North Sea, even whenthe cargo is not  of particular  value  to  us,  on account of  the consequentacquisition of tonnage.  III. In addition, in  all cases where any kind  of suspicion  attaches to a ship that is encountered  (for example,  the suspicion of a  false  Customscertificate) and when  search at sea is not  possible,  it is permissible and desirable to  bring  in  the ship  to  be searched  (not as a  prize).  If thesuspicions  are confirmed  by the search,  the  seizure  of the ship  will  be ordered  at  the place  of  search  (generally  by the Barrier  Commandant,Cuxhaven).  If the suspicions  are not  confirmed,  the steamer will  beallowed to proceed  without  compensation.  IV&quot;. Ships being brought in (whether as prizes or for purposes of search)are to make List.  A  prize crew is  always to be  placed on board them,even if  this can only consist of one man.  (Compare K. d.

With reference to His Majesty&apos;s Order of 12.1.17 A 1119 0 I (Appendix):  I. American passenger steamers running between U.S.A. and Englandare also to be allowed to pass after 12 midnight of 12-13  February, and dutch passenger paddle  steamers running between  Holland and Englandare to be allowed to pass after 12 midnight of 6-7 February ; provided theycomply with the conditions prescribed to them, as follows:  1. American Steamers:    (a) Only one steamer may run  each  week from U.S.A. to Falmouth          and vice versa.    (b) Arrival   at   Falmouth,  Sunday;  departure  from  Falmouth,          Wednesday.    (c) These ships are to make the position 50o N. 20o W. and the Scillies,          on both the outward  and homeward journey.  The ships  steam          14 knots on  an average  and  will  therefore  pass through the          barred area on the prescribed course to England approximately          during the period from Friday to  Sunday,  and on the return          journey approximately during the period from  Wednesday  to          Friday.    (d) Markings on ships: Hull and superstructure painted with alternate          red and white vertical stripes, 3 m. [9-8 ft.] wide, large red and          white check flag  at each masthead, American ensign aft.  At          nightfall, the  painting and  ensign of the ships  are to be made          recognizable at  the greatest  distance possible,  and the ships          are to be lit up throughout.
  2;  Dutch Passenger Paddle Steamers:    (a)  One steamer  may run on each  weekday  between Flushing and          Southwold and vice versa.  The ships must be paddle steamers.    (6)  The ships must make the North Hinder Lightship and must pass          through the barred area by day on both the outward and home-          ward journey.    (c)  Markings of  ships as prescribed for the American vessels, except          that the Dutch ensign takes the place of the American.  II. In doubtful cases,  passenger ships mentioned in (1) and (2) may  beheld  up in order  to  ascertain  their identity  and their  right to run  toand  from  England and  to hear the  markings.  The route prescribed for ships mentioned in (1) and (2)  may not be sown with mines.                                                       ADMIRAL.K. d. H. K. B. 3466.F. d. U.

In all cases in which,  as laid down in Order A 1119 0 I of 12 January,ships are still to be dealt with according to Prize Regulations, the  follow-ing considerations  are to be borne in mind:    (a) The Prussian-American Treaty and the Order that American ships          may only be sunk when more than half of the cargo  is finished          war material for the enemy.    (b) The Timber Agreement with Sweden.  The patrol vessels  in  the          Sound are receiving orders not to issue any more safe-conducts          after the evening of 31 January to harbours within the  barred          area.    In other respects, the Timber Agreement will  not  be          annulled, in  order that  Sweden  may  not  open the Kogrund          Passaged    (c) Ships carrying food-stuffs of Danish origin are to be allowed to          pass, if they have sailed before the evening of  1 February.  The          promise  given to Denmark to allow food-stuffs  of Danish origin          to go through to England will be rescinded on 1 February.    (d) Our Consuls  in  Spain will  receive directions  on 1 February  not          to issue any more safe-conducts for fruit ships.  If ships with          safe-conducts  issued  prior to this  date are encountered, they          must be allowed to pass.                                                        ADMIRAL.K. d. H. K.

The submarine war  is therefore to be prosecuted with tho utmost vigour.No  vessel must remain afloat, the sinking of which is authorized.  Ordersmust be carried  out  with  exactitude, doubts  must  be cleared up  beforegoing to sea.  Such consideration has hitherto been shown to submarine crews, that  now the greatest  efforts are to be expected from them.  Leave is oniy possiblewhen repairs to  the boat are not affected  by it. For this reason, foodallowances of submarines are increased.  The  sole aim is, that each boatshall fire her entire  supply  of ammunition as often as possible.   Thestandard  of  achievement is not  each separate enterprise,  but the totalresult over any  given  period.  Therefore short cruises, short  visits to the dockyard, considerable curtail-ment of practices.  If a submarine is at sea for 14 days in each  month  and fires her  full supply  of  torpedoes and a corresponding  amount of  gun ammunition,  that constitutes the best  form of practice. During periods ofoverhaul, only what is absolutely necessary  is  to  be  done.   The crew  and reserve  personnel are to  be made the utmost use  of.  Venereal diseases represent an avoidable loss from  a military  standpoint often  a very serious loss which must be eliminated  in the future.  Crewsare to be instructed by their Captains as to this military  point  of view, inaddition to   instruction  from  the doctors.   In  addition,  special  ordersregarding the suppression  of venereal  diseases are  being  issued.  Care is to be exercised when manoeuvring  with submarines.  Damage in harbour must be  absolutely avoided.B. Execution of Orders.  Orders: Admiralty  Staff, A 1119 0  I  of 12,1.17; A 1580 0 I  of 18.1.17;A 1993 0 I of 26,1 17.  Limits of stations in accordance with Leader of Submarines Gg. 53/0 of17.1.17.*  Our object is to cut England off from traffic by sea, and not to achieveoccasional results at  far-distant  points.  As   far as possible, therefore,stations must be  taken up near the English coast, where routes convergeand where divergence becomes  impossible.   When the weather, is so  badthat weapons cannot  be used,  better  weather  conditions and  chancesuccesses are  not to be sought at far-distant  points at sea, but  the boat isto remain on her station, if necessary submerging to avoid damage.   Animprovement in  the weather will then be perceived  immediately  and  can at once  be utilized without  any delay  in reaching  the spot.C. Procedure.  Principal advantages of the ruthless submarine warfare:  (1) Attack  submerged on  all ships which are  armed or suspect, whenever the  boat is in a position for attacking submerged or by means of her speedcan reach such a position.  (2) Utilization of all chances of attack by night.* P. 4.-Tr.
   (3)  Immediately effective firing when a ship is stopped by gunfire, with- out time being wasted on warning shots.   (4)  No boat communication;  consequently, when  holding up a ship, the position of the submarine and her distance from the enemy can be chosen solely from the military standpoint.  On principle, way should always be kept on the boat to render an attack moro difficult,  particularly that of an enemy submarine, and in order  that the  boat herself may remain  com- pletely under control, so  as to avoid a torpedo, if necessary.   When a ship, abandoned by her crew, is to be sunk by gunfire, she should be approached from aft;  she is  then not in a position  either to ram or to open fire, as tho submarine traps with hidden armament, reported to date, in every caso  had their  guns on  the broadside.  A trap  will endeavour without exciting notice to keep beam on to the submarine and will  turn accordingly.  Look out for this!  When approaching keep one bow torpedo ready for firing, with the tube flooded, and keep the  enemy under fire; have the boat ready for  diving and  no men  on  deck  except those  actually required,    As a rule, expend only one torpedo on each ship stopped.  If a ship allows herself to bo torpedoed, she  will either be no trap or she will then have ceased to be dangerous.  Consequently she should be finished off with gunfire,  if possible.   A sharp lookout must be kept for the  approach of any further vessels, particularly any which may lie hidden under the lee of the ship attacked. An approach from astern permits of observation on both sides.   The possibility is to be  taken  into account that neutral vessels  also may be armed. D. The passage through the English Channel.   All boats are to proceed through the English Channel; exceptions to this order may be made in isolated  cases.  The objects of proceeding through the  Channel are:   (1) To shorten the cruise, so that each boat may make as many cruises as possible in a given period of  time.   (2) To shorten the period spent in the dockyard correspondingly with the shortening of the cruise,  particularly as  the  heavy strain on the boat  in the  northern  part of  the  North Sea and  in  the Atlantic is avoided.   (3) In cases where  bad  weather  is met with  in the  area of  operations, to allow the  boats  time to await  an improvement,  instead of their being obliged after  a  short  while to start on the long homeward  voyage round the  Shetlands-without having  attained  any  resrdt,  as has  frequently happened.  The  navigation,  when coming  from the West, is simple; from the East- ward,  proceed via  North  Hinder Lightship,  Buoy  2501,* and the Light Buoys  in the  Straits of Dover (further details in the Appendix to &quot; Sub- marine Daily  Orders &quot;).  The  French lights are  burning  with their peace characteristics, though frequently  with diminished power.  These conditions  may change,  con- sequently navigation must be mainly by compass, watch,  and tidal stream chart.  The correct position of  the navigational marks  must be checked on  each cruise.  Proceed  in  the  deepest  channel.  It  is  possible that remains of the former net may still be left; it is best to pass these on the surface; if forced to dive, go down to 40  metres [131 ft.] in order to pass under any  remains of the net.   As far as possible, pass through the area between the Iloofden  and Cherbourg without being  observed  and without stopping;  on the other hand, the  boats,  which in exceptional cases pass round Scotland, are to let themselves be seen as freely as possible in order-to mislead the  English.   Pass  through  Dover  Straits  at  night, when possible with  the tidal stream.  Bad weather provides the most favourable conditions, as the  patrols  then keep a very  poor lookout, and submarinechasers (motor boats) are then innocuous.  Look out for large unlit buoys.  Only in  the case  of being unable to keep the sea is it  permitted to entera Flemish port, particularly  as,  owing to mines and nets, the approach is dangerous without a pilot.* Position apparently about 510 21&apos; N., 20 C E.-Tr.
   A wireless signal from Bruges every  night will give information regard- ing changes in conditions  in  tho Channel.  If there is nothing to report, the signal  &quot; Nothing new &quot;  will  be  made.  Boats  should  arrange  their supplies of oil fuel in such a way that, in case of  a sudden blocking of the Channel, they could at any time proceed round Scotland. E. Counter measures to be  expected.   (a) Nets  and Mines:  Measures  on  a large  scale against the German Bight may  be expected.   The German Bight and the &quot; Way &quot; as far as the Northern part of the Hoofden are kept constantly  under observation hy airships, the Southern part  of the Hoofden by aircraft from Flanders.  The  Fleet  will use all its resources to keep a way to the Northward and a  way to  the Westward clear  of  mines.  In  addition, the boats  will be  escorted by  barrage- breakers, outpost boats, S-Group, and aircraft.  Where danger from mines is suspected, it is advisable to  proceed at a depth of 20-30 metres [65-98 ft.]. The  jumping  wires  must  be  constantly  examined&quot; British  mines are frequently near the  surface;  as a rule they do not  detonato,  particularly with  such short vessels as  submarines,  as tho lever  arrangement does not then  come  into action.  Netted areas  should  be crossed  on the surface. If forced to dive by patrols, go as deep as possible.   The defence of Emdeh against air  attack will be improved.   (b)  Submarine traps.   These are vessels with concealed guns.  Up to the  present  the guns have always been mounted on the broadside,  mostly about in  the  middle of the ship&apos;s length.  These vessels use neutral  flags and often neutral markings also frequently on  reversible boards.   They often  proceed in  the  near neighbourhood of a neutral  .ship, in  order to approach the submarine whilst the  latter  is occupied  with the  neutral.   When held up, they  stop, blow  off steam, in some cases even simulate hits and a fire on board, and abandon the ship in boats, leaving the guns&apos; crews on board.  Frequently the fire is  returned with  a   gun of  small  calibre in order to make the submarine confident and  entice her  nearer, when the heavier guns will open  fire. -Every  ship must  be held  suspect, even sailing ships.  But up to date, no  sailing ships have been identified as submarine traps.   Ships, when stopped, should be approached from astern (see &quot; C,&quot; p. 10). Internal fuzed  shells  from  astern  will  penetrate  the  sides  of  the big after  compartments  (engine-room or holds). For the case of  ships which work  together with submarines,  always keep way on the boat (see &quot; C,&quot; p. 10).  The quicker the submarine  sinks  the  ship  and leaves the  spot, the less time the enemy submarine has for an attack.  Ships have recently been  observed together with  aircraft.   It is uncertain as yet whether theship guides the aircraft to the attack,  or  whether the aircraft leads thoship to the position of the submarine.   Aircraft seen  at sea are in any case a sign that submarine  traps may be in  the neighbourhood.   Submarine chasers large,  very fast  motor boats from a distance look like a submarine or a buoy;  they  endeavour to ram submarines.  It hasbeen  observed that submarine chasers take  up  the position of  light buoys (in the Channel) and  imitate their markings,  in order to  ram any sub- marine which may pass.  They cannot be employed in a seaway.   (c)  Submarine Telegraphy.*  British  searching formations make considerable use of  submarine tele- graphy,* by means of which they also keep touch.  They are able to hear the sounds  of propellers and  possibly  also  auxiliary  machinery,  periscope motor, trimming pump,  ballast pump, &amp;c.   Where it  is suspected thatsubmarine telegraphy is  being used,  dive to a  great depth also in  view of the possibility of towed  bets stop all auxiliary machinery, and proceed with one engine as slowly as  possible;  if  practicable,  stop occasionally and make big alterations of course.  Keep  a watch on the movements of theenemy by means of your own submarine telegraphy installation.* Hydrophones are meant. Tr.
 P. Prize Steamers.   The- taking  of  prize steamers for the reception  of  ships&apos; crews will  in future be unnecessary.  This procedure must cease entirely, as close  to the English coast, where submarines are now to operate, it is not really practicable and would  entail unnecessary  loss of  time,  which  must  be avoided.  Prize crews  will not be provided in the  future.  It is desired that prizes from tho North Sea should be brought in.  They are not to  be brought from  the West coast. G. Procedure in regard to other Submarines.   We  must now take into  account  the possibility of meeting enemy  sub- marines anywhere,   even  on  the West  coast.  Consequently  no  notice should, as  a rule,  bo  taken  of submarines sighted; as far as possible, avoid being seen by them.  Even if tho other boat is definitely recognized as an enemy, and an attack  would meet  with success,  the result  would be less valuable for the war against commerce than if the same torpedo had sunk a  large merchant  vessel.   In cases wherS&quot; a  submarine is definitely recognized as one of our own, intelligence may be exchanged, mutual arrangements  made, &amp;c. H. Identification of the Vessels sunk.   Where it is  feasible  without disadvantage,  the name  and cargo of the ship are to be  ascertained,  and as far as practicable, the papers are to be secured. If this is not possible,  the size of the vessel is to  be estimated. The Captain and  Engineers are, when practicable,  to be taken prisoners. But in no case may the submarine be endangered owing to oommunicating with the ship&apos;s boats. I.  Although details of the orders issued must  not at present be made known to  the crews of submarines,  nevertheless the  decisive importance of the impending phase of tho war is to be clearly impressed upon  the  crews. K.  Intelligence received  from England,  e.g.,  the report of  the Captain of &quot; U.  23,&quot;* proves  that the  British  are  kept  continuously  and  most accurately  informed regarding our submarines and their movements.   Thegreatest reticence  is therefore demanded, particularly  in public places, in trains, &amp;c, in&apos;regard to all matters  concerning submarines, their numbers, and method of  construction, their orders and the manner of carrying them out, their  routes, &amp;c.   The crews  are to  be, instructed  repeatedly  and explicitly on this matter, with the  caution that through carelessness in conversation they  may become answerable for the destruction of their own submarine.                                                   (signed)    BAUER.  * Lieutenant-Commander Schulthess, after being a prisoner in England from 20 July1915, when &quot; TJ. 23 &quot; was sunk, until 4 December, 1916, was transferred to Switzerland ; itwas there, no doubt, that he made the above-mentioned report.  His impression as to the accuracy of our information regarding German submarines was presumably derived either from conversation with British officers after his capture, or from comparing notes withother German submarine officers who were fellow prisoners of his in England.-Tr.
  CHIEF  OF THE ADMIRALTY STAFJ/.             B 3386.                                     BERLIN, &apos;                                                   11 February 1916.                              SECRET IORDER FOR PROCEDURE,AGAINST ARMED  ENEMY MERCHANT                              VESSELS.  I.  Enemy merchant ships  which are armed with  guns are to  he  con-sidered as war vessels and to be destroyed by every means available.  Commanding Officers must bear in mind  that  mistakes in  identity will lead to a  rupture  with  neutral Powers, and that the  destruction of a merchant vessel on account of her being armed may only be proceeded withwhen the armament has  actually been observed.  In  view  of  the  warning  to  Neutrals,  conveyed  through  diplomatic channels, this Order does not come into force until 29 February.  II.  The provisions of paragraph 1 of the Appendix to the Prize  Regula-tions of 22  June 1914 are not affected by the above Order.*                                       By Order of His Majesty.                                    (signed)   v. HOLTZENDORFF.  * The paragraph in question roads as follows:  &quot; The exercise of the right of visit, search and capture, as well as every attack on thepart of an armed merchant ship upon a German or neutral merchant Bhip, is consideredan act of piracy. The crew is to be proceeded against in accordance with the regulations asto extraordinary martial law procedure.&quot;  The German official view is therefore now that a defensively armed enemy merchant ship when attacked by a German submarine has the status of a man-of-war; at other times she is, at best, merely a  merchant ship, and, at worst,  a pirate!
