6541JInvestment of Foreign Capital  in the  British Empire  Development of Oil. - Production in  Private              Lands in Crown Colonies.Admiralty Memorandum for the War Cabinet.            With reference  to-Lord  Robert CeciPs memorandum  of the  14th October E.DoD*Ca 45 and Mr. Walter Longls  memorandum of  the 28th  October GcT*6141 on the Investment  of Foreign Capital in the British Empire, thd Admiralty wish to,  put their  views on the development of Oil in private lands in  Crown Colonies before the War Cabinet.          .The  Admiralty have no desire to hinder the development  of British territory by layiig down hard and fast regulations  excluding  foreign capital.  They  recognise that no matter how much  money of any particular country were to be invested in the British  Dominions  .&amp; Colonies it  would not affect any War or No-War  decisionThioh  might be  forced on  this country.  They assume that  H.M.  Government would be  provided with (1) all the legal power  necessary  to secure complete control oi any Foreign concern  whenever it was desired to exercise it and(2) the fullest inf prma-  tion as to  the  activities of eLl foreign concerns operating irmand  and  raw materials in the  British Empire.   At the sane time tire  disposal of  Oil in peace  may have an important bearing on Naval  operations during War and control obtained only on the outbreak i   hostilities would not meet Admiralty requirements.            The  rights of private owners should not,  however,  be  impaired without urgent reasons ml it  may be difficult and  invidious  to interfere in particular cases unless the general  tight of interference is  fully recognised.  The Admiralty, therefore,  incline to the view thair  provided the Petroleum Executive becomes  a.permanent Department and   . is in a position to give prompt and  well, inf onmed advice to the Government of the day,  the best  c  solution would be to introduce  a system of licensing by enacting  that no one should search for or get petroleum in British territory without a license from the Crown (the licensing in  the.self- governing dominions being, ofcteurse, controlled by  their own Governments if they assent).  This would  carry out  the Game  principle as that contained in  the recent Act passed to control the getting of petroleum within the  United Kingdom.,  and it would  enable the  Crown to investigate the  credentials and  objects of applicants  on the merits of each case  and  to impose  conditions v/hioh would ensure permanent British control where, this appears necessary.   As such licences would apply  equally to  3ritish and to foreign  applicants,  there would be  no  discrimination except in cases where this is  necessary  on  the merits  of the particular  case.           It would be  important to BEke it clear that  no financial considerations  would be  required  for this  license which, would be granted entirely on grounds of  general.policy.   The  obtaining  of this license should be  a preliminary to any grant of a concession either on&apos;Crown lands  or on private  properly,  and -leaving the financial arrangements  to  be dealt with separately as  at  present.                        (Signed)  R.E. WEMYSS.,             v 22.ft2.18.&apos;
