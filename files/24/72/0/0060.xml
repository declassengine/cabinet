270[9 DOCUMENT  IS THE PROPERTY  0? HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT).        I  hare read the  memorandum of  the President  of  the Local   Government Board upon the  financial a scheme  for  the housing of the   working classes in England.        I  fear that none of the  safeguards upon which Sir Auokland   Geddee  relies  to secure the Exchequer against extravagance on the   part  of the local authorities  would, in Ireland,  offer adequate   proteoti on.        To fix a  &quot;border-line  of  one penny in the pound  above which   the ratepayers are not to  be  effected by any increase in the   coat  of their  housing schemes  would open up infinite possibili-   ties  of extravagance  in Ireland, in the way of  purchase of sites   and the making of contracts;  and the only result  of  the elaborate   safeguards,  such as have been  devised for England, if applied to   this  country would be to keep  the Losal Government Board at a   constant  deadlock with the local authorities over the proposed   acquisition of expensive city  building,p^ots, and the Chief   Secretary,  as  president of the Board, would either be held up to   public  obloquy for delaying building operations or else he would   have  to give way and  allow schemes  in  any instances which,   both  in character and detail,  would be infinitely more costly   tha&apos;1;  the  cirburnstances of  the  locality would  properly  demand   or tnan the local authorities  would ask for xt  they had to bear   a share of the expense themselves.        The  views entertained by  the rural district  councils ae to   what  should be regarded as &quot;economio&quot; rents for labourers&apos;   oottages,  according to our experience convinces me that if the   Treasury,  alone,  had  to bear  the losses involved by  reductions   of rents,  when the liroit of one penny wa3 exceeded,  there might   very  soon be a strike against  all rents, save those which were   merely  nominal and it would be Very hard to induce the urban   councils  to dispossesB the occupiers declining  to pay.        The  only  safe policy  for  this  country, I aft  convinced, ii   to give a government  ,$rant in  the shape of a fixed percentage   of the  annual  charge  for principal  and interest.  The percentage   should  be sufficient  to enable the  councils, if due  economy and   forethought are exercised, to  bUild houses without appreciable   loss, so  that,  on the one hand, if  the councils mismanage their   funds,  reduce  their rents  and  build Unproductive  and extravagant   houses,  the ratepayers will share the burden with.tho Exchequer; &apos;   while  on the  other hand, if  they decline to continue building   houses,  owin/t  to the  losses involved in their schemes, the terms   will  be sufficiently  liberal  to enable the Local Government   Board to  Appoint an officer to exercise all their powers underI  tht Housing Aots without undue loss, as they have power to do()  and have  already done with such marked success  under the   Labourers Acts.I C  R 1  T.WAR CABINET.T.  6559.HOUSING OP&quot;THE WORKING CLASSES.(Memorandum by the  chief Secretary for Ireland.)
271     I suggest that the percentage should be 90 .     I am convinced, in the case of the Irish towns,  that  itwould be cheaper in the long, run to adopt.the principle  of this form of assistance and give the local authorities  the incentive to economy rather than to make the Government subsidy contingentupon the amount the oounoils have managed to lose  over theirsohernes.     It ma.y be that the reasons which I have given against theapplication to Ireland of the sonsme of assistance decided uprnfor England,  do not commend themselves to the Cabinet and  thatit is thought more expedient to adopt an identical arrangement both countries.     If this is so, the only suggestion I have to  make is  that,in urban districts where the limit is exceeded and the Govern-ment hare.- to bear the whole loss in respeot of buildings,  thepreparation and completion of the soheme3 should be in the handsof a Commission appointed ad hoc by the Irish Local GovernmentBoard. -                                    (Sgd.)
