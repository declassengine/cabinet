         (This Document is the Property of12His Bncaniis  *(-.::.&apos; &apos;  &apos; v/emment.)         Arising out of what passed at the Imperial War GabiiBtiL  )W)J y^tpciay I wish to say a last word as to the disposal of  &apos;; German East Af r ioa.         The arguments against its return to Germany need not    be restated, as I think it is now agreed that, they are    overwhelming.         The suggestion that it should be offered to tho    United States is to my mind only less objectionable,  it    the Stales ore to be invited to assume frosh responsibilrtie    it would in my judgment be best to propose this in    connection with Constantihople, or in the alternative    Palestine.         I doubt if even now everyone fully realizes either    (1) the importance of keeping German East Africa in our    hands, or (2) what it has cost us in men and money to get    it into our possession.         As regards (1) tho  geographical relation of tho    territory to our East African Protectorates makes it a    key position.  After the war questions of far-reaching    importance will come up  for discussion,  involving a    regrouping.of these Protectorates with a view to their    more effective administration and development.  These    depend absolutely on our retention of German East Africa ,    and if we give it up we  throw away all prospect of a    satisfactory solution.         As regards (2) I have just obtained some    provisional figures which are worth quoting.hero*   The    War. Office estimate the  cost to Imperial Funds of the    East African Campaign at  55,000,000 in addition to (1)     5,000,000 capitalized cost of pensions: (2) naval    expenditure (3)  cost of  sea transport (4) charges defrayed    locally by our Protectorates.
