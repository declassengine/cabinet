(13) Sentences to be imposed  by the Court  shall be carried into effect by such  persons and in such manner  as may be deter- mined by the Chief Allied States and&quot; the United States. Till. RULES or EVIDENCE TO BE APPLIED BY THE TRIBUNAL.  It is not considered desirable to offer any  suggestion as to evidence; a matter  which may  safely be left to  the Court which no doubt will take precautions  to exclude irrelevant matter.  It is obviously impossible to apply  English rules of evidence to  the proceedings  of  a Court the&apos; majority of  the members ofwhich may be unfamiliar with  such rules.IX.-CHARGES  TO BE PREFERRED  BEFORE THE TRIBUNAL.  The enquiries of  the Committee have not reached a stage atwhich it is possible to  state precisely the charges which shouldbe preferred against offenders.  The Committee are still engaged
  in  investigating these  charges.   Subject, therefore, to recon-  sideratioii  and modification the following heads of charges are  provisionally suggested, viz.:        (1) Systematic Terrorism in Belgium, France and elsewhere.      (2) Wanton Devastation,  Destruction  of Property,  and            Pillage.      (3) Illegal Levies.      (4) Illegal  Executions.      (5) Deportation of  Civil Population in  Occupied Territories            and Forced Labour.      (6) Murder of Hostages.      (7) Indiscriminate  Bombardment from the Air.      (8) Indiscriminate  Bombardment from the Sea.      (9) Illegal Methods of Submarine Warfare.    (10) Destruction of  Hospital Ships.    (11) Wilful and Reckless Bombardment of Hospitals.    (12) Ill-Treatment of Prisoners of War.    (.13) Directions to give &quot; No Quarter.&quot;    (14) Use of Illegal Methods of Warfare.   The  Committee desire to point out that if it be determined to bring before the Tribunal for trial persons  who are responsible for  the infringement  of the  Neutrality of Belgium or luxembourg - burg, or for commencing the war, it will be necessary that the Terms  of Peace  shall  expressly provide  for  their surrender  and trial, and their punishment, if they be  found guilty of the act or acts  with which they are charged, and  that the provisions relative to disclosure of  documents must  be extended in order to cover such  cases.  These Recommendations  cover  a  considerable portion  of  the matters  referred to the Committee  under  the  terms of their Reference.  They deal with subjects upon which the enquiries of the Committee are still far from complete.  In view, however, of the urgent necessity  for despatch,  the Committee have pre- sented   the  above  Recommendations  without  stating  theirreasons,  which  will be submitted subsequently.  In  conclusion,  the Committee desire to express their  strongopinion that the Article  or Articles in the Treaty of Peace pro-viding for jurisdiction over enemy offenders should, if possible,be drawn in the most comprehensive terms.               Signed on behalf of the Committee,                        (Signed)    JOHN  MACDONELL.
