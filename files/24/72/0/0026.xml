SJLO.jl3                             OOPY  K.   secretary,      War cabinet future MX nil TAR Y- POLICY IN NGi TH RUSSIA     Since the paper bearing the above number, dated 5thDecember,, was sent to the War Cabinet, I have seon GeneralMaynardo   The latter has pointed out that it will be absolutelyimpossible to maintain evesa. his present petitions on the MurmanRailway unless he is furnished with two railway companies andcertain other technical personnel.     General Maynard1s opinion is confirmed by telegrams fromMurmansk just received which emphasize the urgent necessityfor the early despatch of these reinforcements,     The state of the Murman railway is very critical and I askfor an early decision regarding the above reinforcements*     I may add that it is hoped to be able to send reinforcementto Archangel in case of necessity by the Onega route.   ShouldGeneral Maynard be obliged to retire to the North there  will beno possibility of doing this.                               (Signed)  H. WILSON.  &apos;                                               CeI.G&quot;tS.ftonoral Staff.       War Office,            S.W.I.19th December, 1918.
