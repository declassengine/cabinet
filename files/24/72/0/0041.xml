Report on Activities of Extremists     in Dublin Police Area, during month      4.12-18.     of November,  1918.I.   REPORT BY LORD FREECE.      While the general condition of the country was outwardly satisfactory certain events,- political in themselves, have ad- vernely affected the general life of the country.      The compromise of the Church with Sinn Fein in aome of the Election^ i* greatly to be deplored.  Ix has tended to encourage rather than discourage the wild -peeche-^ of young ouratea, who-e utterance^ in many oasen are far more in- temperate than thone of the laity, and whose word? bite deep into the imagination of the Celtic youth of the country.      This has reflected in a continued increase in the strength of the Irish Volunteer?, which i.e a serious element in the present. condi tion of Ireland..  The Association,  whichhas practically absorbed all the tenets of the Irish republic- can Brotherhood,  hap become a Secret Society in the woret andmost dangerous sense,.  There i ----- no doubt l/aat numbers cfyoung Irishmen,  carried away by aetiments which obliterate common sense and serious thought, join it without realising to what extremes they are being led.      While some of the Catholic Clergy have been most  out- spoken in Condemning this dangerous move on the part rf their parishioners, it might reasonably have been presumed that the Catholic Hierarchy would have thrown their v,eight in as a restraining influence and generally condemned acourse which hampers the well being of the country and  isleading the excitable youth of  Ireland into-paths which thesober thought of all classes and creeds oannot view withanything but dismay,     The Cardinal Archbishop certainly circulated a strongcondemnation of Sinn. Fein throughout his diocese,  but theaction which he  took in the Election Campaign has annulledany real good which migttt have  accrued from thie.
      There    great difficulty  Jr. obtaining reliable  infor-mation  aa to  the inner working  ef thifl Secret Society, and much  care will be necer.*ary to  hold them,  in check until thegood  sense  of the oountry over-ride&quot; the  rebellious feverwhich at present hao a firm grip on a section of tho  com-muni ty.      while  it i** anticipated that the Sinn Feiners elected,may for some  time refuse at attend at Westminister, and thatthere may be  trouble owing to their trying tro net up  a bogusparliament  in Dublin,  it is confidently hoped that firm go-vernment will prevail and be :iucceeful in guarding the beetinterests of  the ma?v:; of the Irish people,      Numbers  of di$contended youth? will  emigrate as  in nor-mal times, but it is believed that the remainder will be ab-sorbed into the industrial life of the country,  if. as ishoped, this is fostered-and enlarged by a judicious policy ofdevelopment.      The present form of &quot;Castle&quot; Government i&quot; quite un^ui .to the requirements cf the country and it would he advisable to consider carefully whether any Adviwy.  Administrativeor Executive body should be temporarily brought into beingwhich would enable  the Irish Government to keep in closertouch with the general feeling of the people,  pending the arrival of the time when the rstate of Ireland wall admit ofthe establishment of pome form of self-government.

YOUR EXCELLENCY,           I have the  honour  to submit the following report on the  general conditions in Ireland during the month of November in so  far co they bear  upon Military Dispoaitioi-iS in the Country:-  GENERAL STATE OF  THE COUNTRY.          The general  sueoesa of the  allies on all fronts  and  the  signing of the Armistioe had a restraining influence on  the  Sinn  Fein Party.  Nothing of importance  affecting the peace  of the  Country occurred.  HOSTILE ACTIONS,           The  Police  made a  number  of searches and seizures in  premises occupied  by linn Feiners.   oome revolvers end  guns  were  seized.          At CORK on November 4th. a  Sinn Feiner named McNSILUS resisted  search and fired  at  the Head-Constable  with a revolver,  dangerously  wyuiaing him.   McNeilus was arrested and placed in Cork  Gaol,  but  he  was subsequently  rescued a  few days  later from Prison in a moot  daring manner by a party of oirm Feiners, who entered by a ruse and  overcame the  Orders.           Evidence  was  obtained through  seizures by the Police,  in  different localities,  that  the  3inn  Feiners have  a quantity  of  explosives and fuses  scattered throughout the country, and that  they &amp;re engaged  in  manufacturing gunpowder and  bombs.  RAILWAY  DEFENCES.           In view of the  filtered military situation Defenoe Schemes  have been modified and fresh schemes, prepared.         -  In consecuence  of  this re-organisation I sh&amp;ll  probably be  able  to  save  the personnel  of 5 R*DoCi,  Companies  and as  I undoratane  there is  an urgent need for the employment  of tlie^e. oeimoaniGS  in  England  I have &quot;offered thorn to  the I Jar  Office.  MILITARY GUARDS ON PRISON3*    In consequence  of representations  made  by tbearish  Government I  have  provided  military Guards  at the  following prisons:-                               Mountjoy.                               Cork.                               Belfast..                               Sligo.           These it  apoears have  been  rendered  necessary by the\ inadequacy of tho  strength  of the civil police.   The dtrties  of  these  guards will be to  defend tho prison&quot; from any  attack from outside  and to  assist  the  prison staff to me in tain-order  within  the  prison  if  oalled. upon to  do  so by  the  Governor,   The guards are  mounted  under K.R.955  to 975 and not under D-.R.R.           I  have reported tlfis  action to the V/ar Office and have  a3ked  the Irish Oorvemment  to relieve tho^a .4.111^ry Gr^rds by Police at  the earliest  possiblo.moment.   ...II.

RET,134III.   Report, by Inspector General,  Royal  Iri eh ,,Qor^t,abularx,                  for^month pf^KoTembsrj.1JIBf*UypER SECHETARY.       I have to report that the month of November wascomparatively uneventful in the provinces.   The news of thearmistice with its promise of peace brought a sense of relief to every class of the community but it evoked nouniversal enthusiasm.   The people had been depressed by themenace of Conscription, but they had net suffered any seriousprivations consequent on the War.       There was no change for the better in the state ofpolitical unrest j   &quot;but considered without reference topolitics the condition of the country was fairly satisfactory       The various commercial industries were active, though no new developments of importance came under notice, andfarming, owing to the high price of all agricultural produce,continued to be very profitable, - the banking returnsafford evidence of general prosperity.     .  There was no scarcity of employment at wages largely in excess of pre-war rates, the workers however,  were stilldissatisfied and in many cases demanded a further increase -Strikes were reported at several places but none of them.woreof serious consequence,   At the aerodrome at Cruralin, Co.Antrim 2,000 employees went on strike as a. plot est against areduction of wages for shorter hours and were paid off,  but900 of them re-engaged.   At Ballymaquirke aerodrome in Cork400 hands ceased work because special trains were not runfor them at nominal rates,  1^0 were dismissed and theremainder returned to work.       Land purchase remained in suspension,-   In Clare andGalway on account  of the continued prevalence of ihtumida---tion 140 persons  were under police protection.,there was alsofriction over land in Tipperary, Sligo, Mayo, Westmeath andQueens Co., but the farming classes are at present extremelywell off and for some months past their attention has been concentrated on political questions and resistance to conscription,  and agrarian agitation has subsided.       The Criminal Statistics for the month present fewunusual features,  the following cases however should bement ioned &apos;:-       Cork.   On November 4th. Ed. Con. Clarke  and three               police were searching the lodgings of a Sinn               Fein Volunteer,  Penis KpNeiles for arris when               he fired at them with a revolver  and seriously               wounded the Hd.  Const.  He was arrested and               lodged in Cork Gaol.               On the 11th November. McNeiles was rescued by               persons unknown who having obtained permission               to  see him in Gaol attacked and overpowered               the Warders in charge, and escarped with the               prisoner,  - none of the party have yet been               traced.               On  the 11th November on the occasion of a               Volunteer funeral1 in the suburbs  of Cork, when               a Sergt. moved forward to &quot;identify persons who               had fired shots over the grave he and the               police with him were att a;cked and the S0rgt.               received serious injuries.
     GAL WAY,  E.R. On.Nov. 2nd oat tie wore maliciously driven                 - off a farm near Oastleblakoney,.  police                  pursued and t&apos;&apos; spersed the drivers - 12  cf                  the ringleaders will he prosecuted.                  On the night of November 3rd.  at Derrpbrie                  a horse valued at  60 was maliciously                  stabbed in the  stable.   The only motive                  assigned is that the owndr ** Martin                  Markham - is a loyal man and strongly                  opposed to 3 inn Fein,Tho orders declaring Glare and Cork, \&apos;f.Rv Gpecial  Militaryareas remain in force,       Open hostility to the R.I.C. is hot now so  widelymanifested, but the disaffected regard them as the Chiefobstacle to the success of their  seditious enterprise,  andin the more disturbed districts very bitter feeling towardsthorn still exists.

m W &apos;iPolitical energy was o.-moat exclusively devoted to preparation for the G-eneral Election and when the date was announced the ulster Unionist Societies became active.   Sir Edward Carsonarrived at Belfast and is expected to remain there until theElection is over.   All the Unionist candidates in the provincearc opposed by Sinn Feincrs and efforts are being made to stir up opposition in labour circles.         The Ulster Volunteer force remained passive - morerifles were surrendered.   The police have not yet receivedauthentic information as to the total number already handedover to Military custody, but they have reaaon to believethat it is considerable.         For some time past it has been obvious that the IrishParliamentary Party had outlived their popularity, even withthe R.(3.Clergy.   The  chief complaint now urged against them is that on the outbreak of war they failed to obtain from government satisfactory guarantees with regard to Home Rule.,Their organization&quot; has been singularly apathetic with regardto the new register of voters.   Thirty - two members of theParty did not seek re-election, allowing twenty-five SinnEeiners to be elected on nomination day unopposed, and it isnot iupr^^blo that many more Nationalist seats will be lost,  ,         The Sinn Eoin party was most active and nominatedcandidates for 102 of the total 10.5&quot; Constituencies.  As soonas it was ascertained that during the Elect ion period permitswould bo dispensed with, numerous public meetings were heldall over the Provinces, but they.were mostly small and none of them eould be described es enthusiastic which was no doubtdue in great measure to the absence of Mr. Be Valora and nearly all the prominent loaders,  who are either interned orimprisoned.         Erv 0&apos;Flanagan, a suspended priest, actingPresident of Sinn Eein, was the principal speaker in severalbounties *   With tho exception of R.CClergymen there werefew others of any importance and, making allowance  for theheated atmosphere of an election contest,  the language used,though disloyal and bitterly anti-English, was,  on the whole,not worse than might be anticipated.         The speakers made the usual demand for separationfrom England and complete independence and all seemed to beconfident that some substantial concession to their claim willbe obtained either through the Peace Conference or throughthe personal intervention of the President of the UnitedStates.         The Clorgy were more intemperate in their languagetha.n the lay men.         At a meeting at Kilfinane on November,  24th. theReVi Er, Hayes,- C.C read the oath of allegiance taken bymembers of Parliament and asked how any man oould take thatoath and be faithful to Ireland.   Speaking on the futilityof sending members to Parliament he said that Catholicemancipation was not won by the Irish members - Wellington \admitted it was &quot;given to avoid rebellion?   Churchdisestablishment, was brought about by the death of the Fenians;the land acts were tho result of the farmers barricadingtheir houses,,.w.they must elect Sinn Eeiners if they wanted Ireland to be free as&quot; the other countries of Europe.
-In-138          Hey,  Fr,  fell,  0.G.*  declared that the policy  of Sinn Fein is  Ireland a Nation-   In  the  course cf his speech he said that they had  more than one string to their how.   They did not depend entirely  on the Peace Conference. Sinn Fein w.mld establish  a constituent  assembly whiwh would use  moral foroe and perhaps ether force  in furtherance of the tluso of  their country,  and that later thsy  would if heocoea: uflfi  physical  force,  He  pxLdoo. that th,;y  intended to- **tA &amp;irmm:to the  Jnitad.Bt&amp;t*c ..s.rl  ether countries to  otir up enmity&quot; aguinut Engia.iia,          Ilio  northern.Bishops  fearing that as tho result of throe  ooxiered  oontests certain Nationalist Constituencies in Ulster were in  danger of btang captured hy Unionists zo the  prejudice  of catholic  education  and  other catholic interests,  appealed to Mr..John  Dillon and to Mr, McNeill, Vice  President of  3inn Fein .they ignored F;. 0&apos;Flunagan; to oompese  their differences  and divide  the  constituencies between their  parties.   As *this avpefil  die.  net give immediate promise  of bearing  fruit,  Cardinal LogUB, who is not  a supporter of Sinn  Fein  wrote to the Lord Mayer of Dublin requesting  him to invite Mesore.  Dillon and McNeill to meet him and discuss  the proposal.    Hi^ Eminence intimated that should no agreement be arrived at he would be constrained to advise his  flock  in the particular constituencies to  vote for the Sinn  Fein can-candidates whc$ he no doubt considered to  be  the stronger.          The Lord  Mayer&apos;8  Conference failed  to agree en the question  cf allocation and referred tho matter tor  decision by the Cardinal who allocated  to the Irish Parliamentary Party, South Down, N.E. Tyrone, E, Donegal,  and L-J, Armagh; and  to Sinn Fein,  Perry  City,  E, Down, N, w\Ty:..-one,  and 3. Fermanagh.      v          The staady growth cf  Sinn Fein  from a small body to its present  vast dimensions has been mainly due  to  the general dread  of Conscription, the republican programme also  holds  a powerful attraction for the younger men and a large number of  the younger priests.          Practically the entire Nationalist yout;h of both sexes  in  the country have  become obsessed with the  idea of an Irish  Republic  and with the policy of abstention from the House  of Commons,    Persons cf stake and probably  a large  majority of  the P.C,Clergy, some cf whom have had the courage to  condemn it  in the  strongest terms, view this popular movement with apprehension;  but at present, with the prospect of a  sensational  victory on polling day,   it is too strong  to be affected by adverse opinions or warnings from  any  quarter.          The candidates for election comprise,  &quot;besides thePresident and  a Vice President cf Sinn Fein,  a few doctors, solicitors, farmers and shopkeepers,  together with  clerks.Ex Post Office  Clerks, students, teachers,  commercial travellers, a  labourer and other persons of insignificance, chosen apparently  on account of their rebel antecedents -None  of them have  ever sat  in  Parliament.&apos;   A large number of them are interned or evading internment.    Others. including Robinson, an Irish Volunteer who was recently sentenced at Glasgow to 10 years penal servitude for exporting explosives to.Ireland, are  in gaol; and another,named Kent was  sentenced to 5  years penal servitude on /5/16 in connection with the  murdor-of a policeman, but was released under the amnesty in June,  1917*
          Nearly 1,35^ Sinn Fein Clubs are now known to the , poliC&apos;n,  Kit there was no appreciable increase in the mem&quot;ber-\ 8hip during the month.   The funda of the organisation have \ been raised chiefly in Ireland and its financial position is not regarded as very solvent,          As I have pointed out in previous reports since the suppression of political gatherings (unless with permit j and of drilling under the Defence cf the Realm Regulations, the v Irish Volunteers have become practically a Secret Society.          $mbarrasned by the absence of their influential and experienced leaders, and confronted wi&quot;:!$r elaborate police arrangements reinforced by the assistance of strong Military forces throughout the provinces,  they have bsen compelled to abandon  open display of physical force;   and isolated breaches of the Regulations by drilling!: wearing uniform,  or flagrantly seditious demonstrations were  promptly dealt with by the arrest and prosecution of ringleaders.    Information as to the inner working of this branch of Sinn Fein can or*ly be gained from the informants who ar*&quot; difficult to procure,  and by the chance seizure of documents on the persons and in &apos;he houses of suspects by which means however a good deal of useful intelligence was obtained.          The Volunteer movement  is being kept inflamed by the secret circulation of seditious and republican literature including &quot;An Togiach&quot;,  described as the official organ of the Irish Volunteers.          In a few oases where  the printers of this stuff could be located action was taken,  but  the source of &quot;An Togiach&quot; has not yet  been discovered.    Like  &quot;The Irish Volunteer&quot; which was published prior to the 1916 Rising,  the new journal supplies together with other objectionable matter instructions for destroying railways,  etc.    The following extract from the 6th  issue,  dated November,  l?&apos;th is interesting showing - as it does tho continued rebellious activity of tMs daner- ous society:- &quot;A representative meeting^ Volunteer Officers&quot;from every part of Ireland waa hold recently in &quot;Dublin. &quot;The Soport of tho Director of Organization submitted to &quot;the representative mooting of officers  showed how &quot;astonishing had boon tho growth  of the  Irish Volunteers &quot;during  tho past year.    Thoro are now 1^00 affiliated &quot;Companies as  compared with 390  at the tints-of last years1 &quot;Convention.    The  increase has not boon confined, to any &quot;portion of the country but has boon equally marked in e^ory &quot;province&quot;.         It will be  noticed that tho membership of  the Volunteers is  not specified, also that the number  of Com- panies nearly  corresponds to tho  number  of dinn Fein clubs reported by the colic 0.   Tho police estimate of tho vol- unteors  strength;,  formed chiefly  from observation  when training was  openly practised,  is approximately 350 branches with a membership of  about 30.000;  but it is known that each Sinn Fein Club,ia ordored to form  a Volunteer unit,  and tha  discrepancy with respect to companies may . bo  aae partly  to exaggeration  and partly to the fact that that &quot;An Toglaoh&quot; has  includod nominal companies which have not appe-arod  in public         A reliable  informant who  lately  visited tho 8inn. Fein Head Quarters  in Dublin describes them as  recreation rooms, a place  of resort  for Unemployed,  and an as tab Undent                                                       for
for the relief of an army of enthusiasts, most of whom have no means of livelihood and who, while they are allowed to draw on the funds, will continue to hang on there. He says that the majority of those who frequent the place have nothing to do but ? trouble and thinks that the longer DeValera is interned the more ? will the funds disappear. He gathered ? the sole object at present is to win all the seats possible at the General Election, and seek representation at the Peach Conference, and that efforts are ? made to put the Sign Fein case before the nation likely to be represented. He further states that the most extreme do not now expect a Republic and would be satisfied with Colonial Home Rule provided it came through the efforts of ? Fein.  Failing such a settlement they propose to set up a constitment assembly to resist the levy of direct taxation and in fact usurp the Government of the country. They rely on the aid of Sinn Feiners in America, and expect arms through them.

He thinks that the present policy will live just as long as the funds hold out, and that meanwhile though they appear to have no definite plans there is an extreme Section which in time of excitement might plurge the country into serious trouble.

The information supplied by this man has hitherto proved most accurate.

To sum up, Sinn Fein dominates public bodies and terrorises society in at least three provinces, and is keeping the whole country in a state of unrest by its republican pretensions. It appears to be now entirely under the influence of the Irish Volunteer Section which is saturated with sedition and hatred of British rule and under no effective control. The Volunteers are insufficiently armed and equipped for conflict with soldiers, and fear of the troops restrains them from rebellion. But unless a counter movement of the responsible citizens should arise, of which at present there is no indication, they are sufficiently organized with the weapons at their disposal, and supported in every direction by numbers of turbulent young men who if not actually in their ranks are in close sympathy with them, to be ? and to make government impossible in the event of the Military Force in the country being reduced.
