Owing to  the  warm  weather winter corn and beans aremaking excellent progress, and the absence of frost has greatly facilitated the harvesting of the remainder of the potato androot crops.                 LOCAL  ORGANISATION DIVISION.Determination of  Tenancies.  &apos;  During the week 3 Orders havebeen made by  the  Board determining tenancies on account  of badforming in  respect  of 93 acres.

A  meeting  was held at Louth of representatives of bodies interested in  the continuance of navigation on the Louth.Canal and of  those  who desire to use the Canal as&apos; a drainageChannel.    The canal,  after  descending from Louth by a seriesof locks, continues for about seven miles with scarcely  any fall(this portion&apos;beinp known as tho Long Pond).   It crossesseveral of  the natural channels  some of which it  Intercepts,while others  are  carried under it in culverts.

HORTICULTURAL DIVISION * Provision  of  Land for Allotments.   On the 6th December,  1918, the allotments  Inspectors appointed by  the Department had completed a  year!s work.   During the 13  months ended 31st December, 1917, 17,000 acres  providing 205,000  allotments had been acquired by Local Authorities,  and as this  area included a large proportion of the available unoccupied land,  difficulty was being experienced In securing land for additional allotments.   The allotments inspectors were, therefore, appointed to stimulate the local authorities and assist them in  acquiring suitable sites  that would not subsequently involve the State  in heavy claims for compensation. Jn order that land  already In use for important agricultural purposes might not be taken. It was necessary for the Inspectors to survey a much larger area than  that ultimately chosen; the result has been that local authorities have been enabled.t? secure a further 12,610 acres, comprising 179,304 allotments.         &apos; During the past 6 months  the inspectors have also dealtwith 145 claims for compensation, amounting to  7,210 which havebeen settled for an aggregate of  4,563,Marketing Section.  The  market opened in July at Crowborough,East Sussex, has been an unqualified success.          The Buckinghamshire Society has opened a new depot atWhltchurch which is intended to cover the Whitchurch and OvindDistrict.   Local support for this depot has been secured..          Progress is being made ,with the formation of asociety for South Hants,
            The Dorset and West Hants. Society report that the al  of shares actually applied for to date represent   1,500 and thl  promises have been received for a further  300.  Technical Instruction.   A conference of the Horticultural  Sub 4  Committee and Local Representatives was held at Leicester on tl  instant, when the Departments schemes for technical instructic  explained.   The greatest enthusiasm was shewn and from stateme  made  by the various representatives present it was evident  that  schemes are very much appreciated and that good results will be  in the county.  Prop  Testing.   The Department^ scheme for the formation of cro  testing stations has been favourably received.    Two large  grow  In Middlesex have offered plots of ground for the purpose,  arrangements for the supervision and working of which are now bi  considered.                        TECHNICAL DIVISION.  Inspection of Land.    A visit was paid to a farm on the&apos;-High  Weald in Sussex, which Is typical of a large area of land in th  and the adjoining county of Kent.   The land Is very heavy  and  mostly under grass, the custom being to graze sheep  and cattle  with  little or  no concentrated feeding stuffs.    Little  if  any  artificial manure has been used,  with the result  that the pastui)  have  become Impoverished.    The small proportion  of  arable  land  has been allowed to become poor at the expense of the hop lands  which haye received all the dung.   It is obviously  desirable  that  the grass  land should be  restored to condition  by the  application of  basic slag and,  in some cases, lime  In addition,  which fertilisers have been proved to have very beneficial  resul  As  regards the  arable land, it is suggested,  inter  alia,  that  temporary leys, for a time at  least,  should take  a  prominent pis  in  the rotation, so that the soil may be supplied with the  orga&apos;  matter in which at present it  is  extremely deficient,                             - 4 -
 Experiments with Fodder Strawt  Throughout the past year an investigation of the possibilities of the soda process of treating fodder straw with a view to enhancing its feeding value has been in progress at the University of Leeds under the supervision, of Che of the  eohnlcal Advisers.- - - This, process has been developed on a very large scale in Germany during the war,, and considerable claims have been made for it in the German press.   In the Leeds experiments a method has been devised-for carrying out the process on the farm,.   The work is now completed and the results indicate that although the digestibility of the straw oan be very appreciably&apos; increased by the treatment, the economy of. the process is very doubtful.   A quantity of treated straw has been prepared for the purpose of determining the digestibility of the.product.   A detailed report of the investigations is in preparation, Frit Fly Experiments,  A report has been submitted on experiments in connection with oat growing carried out this year in noted frit infected districts in Wiltshire and Hampshire.   The trials were-of a preliminary nature, but have nevertheless given results of considerable interest..   In. the&apos;first place Mt is clearly established that frit Infestation cannot be carried in the seed. Secondly, the value of early sowing for avoiding injury caused by the frit fly Is shown conclusively - It has previously tpeen deduced from general observations in the field, but experimental evidence was lacking.   In&apos;this&apos;connection it is remarkable that eariy :sowing minimises the attack not only on the young plant, but also on the kernel.   Thirdly, evidence has been,obtained to show that frit fly is a more serious pest than has previously been realised., .  The evidence indicates that even in the present year, when the damage to the young plant was almost negligible, the attack on the oat kernel caused an actual&apos;reduction in crop of something like 8$, rising in some cases to 40$.
LABOUR DIVISION.           The  controlled labour now on farm work in England and Wales  is  as  follows:-&apos;           Soldiers.... i i.....&apos;.............72,225           Women&apos;s Land  Army.....................,    12,468           Prisoners  of  Vfar.......................    30,464           Total..................................   115&quot;, 157           Four weeks  ago the total number was 119,165. Ploughmen for  Autumn  cultivation.    The number of soldier plou  included  in  the  statement  just  given,  who have been released by military  authorities  on  agricultural furlough to assist  with ant cultivation  is now 5,931,  an Increase  of 2,355 over last week. War Office have  extended the furlough  of these men indefinitely, Harvest Labour.    Of  the 10,000 soldiers who were  specially rel: by the military  authorities to  assist  with harvest work, 1,378\ still out  on farms assisting with  the  ingathering  of the remain) of the potato  harvest.   The number of prisoners still out undej the migratory  gang system  Is 5,093  most of them being engaged potato lifting. Demobilisation.    Up to  the present time the names of 2,835 agriculturists have been forwarded to  the Department of Demobilisation and Resettlement  for early rolease  under  ,the scht for the return to  civil  life of  a  number of pivotal men  in advai of general demobilisation,                         Women&apos;s Branch.Employment.   The  field  workers  who were employed  on seasonal work such as potato lifting and  root pulling have  now almost aillbeen released and  a number  are available  for placing in  other woj          There is no difficulty in placing competent and experienced milkers, but farmers expect  a very high standard of efficiency in this work.                                       j
           The  Timber  Supply Department Is  forming two large gangs In Denbighshire at  the end of the month,  In which It  Is probable that  upwards of  100 L.A.A.S.  will be employed,  Wore women may possibly be used in cutting  pit  props in Durham If satisfactory billeting arrangements can be made.           In Wales, *s a  whole,  the demand and  supply of women is  about equal.           13,954  women are accounted for in the Land  Army as follows:-          On  farm  work...................,......... 12,468          Lent  to  Forage Department  ,,......,........      96          Lent  to  Timber Supplies Department......,     239          In  Instruction Centres  .................,,     409          Waiting  for  references  to  be  placed in           training centres....................,44          Waiting  in Depots ......166          fsiting  in their  own homes................     532                                                    13,954 Four  weeks ago the total number  was 14,658.           The  decrease in  numbers is due to the fact  that a large number  of  women have  now completed  the original period  or which they  enrolled,                         CULTIVATION DIVISION.

Most of the  steam  tackle 3*sts 4tioh  have hitherto be at work  have now been  withdrawn  for the winter in order that t! may be thoroughly overhauled and repaired, since  this has notl done for two years. Coal for Agricultural  Purposes.  The  procedure for obtaining c j for agricultural purposes  which  was explained  in  the  report ofj 4th September  last, has  now  been modified, and a  fresh schedule the amount of  coal to  be allowed for  the various  operations has; been drawn up.         .  Application  will be made on a form obtainable from t: Local Fuel Overseer, registered  coal  merchant  or  licenced coal dealer,  which,  when completed, will be  forwarded  to the Local Fuel Overseer,  who will  arrange  for the supply of coal up to the maximum allowed by the schedule,    Pdrsons requiring coal in excess  of the amount  allowed  by the.  schedule must  make application to  the Agricultural  Executive Committee,  who, if satisfied  that  an additional quantity should be allowed, will make a recommendation  to the Local Fuel Overseer  to that effect                           SUPPLIES DIVISION. Fertilisers.    p  contract  for the  purchase of  250,000 tons  of phosphate  rock  from North Africa has  now been  arranged by the Ministry of Munitions, and supplies for the remainder of the  pn fertiliser season are  consequently assured.    The  quantity  of phosphate rock  Imported  into the United -Kingdom during the  firstmonths of  the fertiliser year has  been  222,000 tons,  while,  in addition 76,000  tons are due to arrive  within  the  next six  weedmaking a total  of  practically 300,000 tons  Imported up tbtheei of  January.   Shipments  from the new  contract  will  probablybejat  the rate of about 50,000 tons a month,  so that  the  total suJof  phosphate rock  for  the year ending 31st May next should  be m
    less  than 500.000 tons  (equal to 900,000 tons of superphosphate), as    compared with  the 700,000 tons which was available last season.             Deliveries of sulphate of ammonia and basic slag have been    well  maintained, though the production of basic slag suffered to    some  extent  by the  suspension of work during armistice week.   The    figures for  the six months 1st June to 30th November are as follows:                              Production             Deliveries                              ITmohths 3une 1st - November 30th.

The total production of muriate of potash by    the British  Potash  Company during the present season is estimated at    1,430 tons,  of which about 860 tons will be available for England    and Wales,  the balance going to Scotland and Ireland.   Of the    English supply 580  tons has so far been sold, and deliveries are    being made  as  the material is produced.    Seed  Potatoes.  Arrangements have been made for the shipment of    2,200 tons  of  seed  potatoes required by the French Government and    also  for further quantities required by Portugal.    Seed  Wheat.    Demands for the Departments selected wheat are still    being received and  supplies of all varieties remain to meet moderate    requirements.    Export of Ryegrass  Seed.   On the recommendation of the Seeds    Advisory Committee  it has been decided to release further quantities    of high grade  ryegrass seed for shipment to the Allies, and to allow    seed  unsuitable for use in the United Kingdom to be exported freely.    This  Is conditional on there being no increase in the current market    price of ryegrass seed for home consumption;  there has recently    been  a marked  fall.
