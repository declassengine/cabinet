* (5 o   *L             RE SOLUTIONS AS TO  THIS&apos; HEJAZ  AIID ARABIA v- 1.       It  is  desirable that the  speoisl position of  Great  Britain in Arabia  should be  recognised by the Powers as it  has  already  been by  the  French  Government  in the correspond-  ence  and  negotiations of 1916 end 1917. 2..      HJvl, Government  are already pledged  to secure.that the  Holy  Places  shall  remain in  possession cf an independent  sovereign  Moslem Power.   It is desirable, therefore, from the  point of view more especially of Moslem sentiment,  that the  restrictions on the independence and sovereignty of the King  of the Hejaz should be as few as possible, if any such are  found necessary,3,       It is not desirable that the Ling1s foreign relations  should be  controlled  by  any  European Power,  and no such claim  should be made by His ].iajesty&apos;s Government.4.       It  is desirable that  the Powers should formally  recog-  nise  in a  treaty the peculiar position of the Hejaz and bind  themselves not to interfere  in its internal  affairs, nor to  seek political influence for  themselves or their subjects.5,      It would follow, and should be stipulated, that any  agent  kept by the Powers in the Hejaz, should have  no diplomatic  status or  functions,  but should be confined  to  /purposes-  connected with the pilgrimage or trade.   Equally the ICing of  the Hejaz should not bo allowed to be represented by Agents  at Foreign Courts..
                       - -                         :           696.    -  It is not worth rhile to dispute about the titXo    &quot;King of the Arab Countries&quot; which has already boon assumed    by King Husain.   But wo should refuse to recognise any    inferences which he nay draw from it ts to his status,  and    the question of his suzerainty should not be settled by  us.    The attitude of Llesopotamia and of the principal chieftains    of the interior and coast appears to render it certain  that    his extreme claims will not be accepted by them.V.      It is not desirable that the King of the Hejaz should    continue after the War to be directly subsidised either  by    Great Britain or any  other Christian Power,   The subvention    formerly paid to him by the Turks should be replaced, as far    as possible, by annual subventions from tho Arab Stats  of    Syria and possibly from the Arah States of Mesopotamia.    These subventions might be paid to him as Keeper of the  Holy    Peaces,    There would,  however, be no objection to the pay-    ment to him of a joint subsidy by Great Britain, Prance  and    Italy, as Powers ruling largo Moslem populations, for pro-    tecting the interests, of their pilgrims,    In any case the    King should not suffer pecuniarily from the change in his    political position.8.      The Hojaz should  not be called upon to contribute any    annuity  to the service of the Ottoman Public Debt.9.      It is hoped by an  international convention to secure the  -  prohibition of the export of arms and ammunition to all  States    in Asia /Minor and Arabia which do not ask for a European    Advisory  Power;   but  in view of its peculiar position, some    special  provisions would have to be made in the case of  the    Hejaz.    Meanwhile steps should be taken to prevent excessive    importation of arms into that country..10.      It is desirable that His Majesty&apos;s Government should    abstain  from any interference in the question of the Zhalifate,    or the choice of s Khalif.
