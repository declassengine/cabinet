MEMORANDUM FOP 7:IE MB    CABINET.   _        I circulate herewith for the information cf theWar Cabinet a report which I hrwe received from a confidentialbut an absolutely reliable source.COLONIAL OFFICE,                        W.H.I.                                       31 * 12 o 18.        I have heard a good deal from all parts of the country during  the past two days, and I believe the marvellous or-ganimation and the success cf the Sinn Feineis and the votingof Cardinal Logue and Archbishoo Walsh for Sirccb Fein has made such an impression that the Nationalist ferty is now withoutany following except the middle class;  solicitors/ .shopkeepersand the like,                                      -&apos; -  ;        I have watched the rise and fall of every political party in Ireland for the last 40 years, and I think the pre-sent movement is much the most difficult and dangerous of any the Government have had to deal with and for this reason.        Their loaders are brave and fanatical and do not fearimprisonment or death;  they are not to be influenced by private negotiations with Bishops and Priests,  or captured by getting the patronage of appointments which has been thefavourite instrument of the Irish Government since 1905. Neitherdo they care a straw for the Press.         It is a fair and square fight between the Irish Govern-ment and the Sinn Fein as to who is&apos;going to govern the country.         The main difficulty they have is this.  While the Leadersare prepared to organise and fight anything whether it becompulsory levy of taxation, the repudiation of&apos; land purchaseannuities,  the suspension and regulation of traffic,  etc, theronv ov^i -f4io r,va AnnA *rr**-Kamr extreme measures which willrank and file are dead against anybring tn&amp;m..tip against Lord French.         This is the Sinn Fein&apos;s trouble.,  because if they cannot do something bold to capture the imagination of their Irishtheelections) they will lose caste and then the handful of officialNationalists in- the House of Commons may make such play in thelimelight, that as a last resort the Sinn lein may have to takethe oath and go to Westminster also, and once they do that, allidea of a Republic or a kind of government they want, or a SinnFein created government at home is gone for ever.         It is a desperately critical time for then, this first six months,, unless Lord French can b3 got rid of by some meansor other.  Hence you see the Transport Union crowd tho areSinn Fein to a man. all joining in this ant i-Advisory Committeecampaign &quot;by which they have some hope that Lord French may bediscredited and given some other command by the Government-.
