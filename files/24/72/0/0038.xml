(Appendix).          The cost of the scheme se,v out&quot; in Paper No.111 was estimated at  824,000-  50,000 lens than the cost of the scale set out in the Appendix, so far as  Naval Officers were concerned.          SIR C. HARRIS stated  that for the Army the 31 days pay scale would cost from half to three quarters of a million more than the War Office scale.          The majority of the Committee agreed that the principle to be followed should be the same as that adopted in. the case of gratuities for Non-Commiseioned Officers andMem,  namely, that there should be a minimum gratuity based on 67 dayst? pay  in the case ofboth Naval and Military Officers, and that there should be added to this a uniform increment,  according to the number of months served over and above the minimum period.         The War Office and Admiralty represent&apos;atives undertook to prepare scales showing theamount of gratuity which would be payable  ona basis of 67 days&quot;&quot; pay,  with increments
calculated at the rates of (a)  1 and (b) 30/-per month for&apos;Army Officers below the rank ofBrigadier-General, and for Naval Officersbelow the rank of Commodore,  with monthlyincrements of (a) 22 and (bj   3 per month for offi^oers of higher rank.  Provision would also bemade in the scales for a 50$ reduction in theincrement in the case of officers who had notserved ahrcad.
