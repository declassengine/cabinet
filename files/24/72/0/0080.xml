MEMORANDUM BY THE FOOD CONTROLLER.     On resigning my office as Pood Controller  I think the following brief summary of my&quot;present views es  to the lines onWhich food policy should develop may possibly bo found helpful.     The extent to which  Food Control must bo  continued in thiscountry depends in large measure upon the general food needs ofEurope and these have not yet been clearly ascertained.  Subjectto this general consideration I take the follow that Rationing shouldbe dispensed with at the earliest possible moment, that is to sayas soon as there is a reasonable prospect of supplies beingadequate to meet tho normal demand.  So far as I can see it will bepossible very shortly to dispense with coupon rationing except inthe case of Butchers1 Meat and possibly butter.   Control of distribution through the registration of customers for certainfoods will however have to be maintained for somo time     This form of control over the distribution of supplies towholesalers and retailers is necessary in order to ensure that                                   *consumers get their fair share.  How soon this modified controlcan be dispensed with will depend mainly upon the amount ofsupplies available.     Control of Imports of certain foods must in my view continue,Staple articles of food cannot be left to compote for freightwith non essential articlese  Control of Imports for this purposeprobably involves the actual purchase of such foodstuffs onbehalf of the Ministry and their re-sale to the  Trade.  Even ifshipping control is relaxed or partially abandoned I assume theGovernment will take steps to ensure the provision of adoquatefreight for food at controlled rates.     The necessity for controlling prices is likoly to surviveafter all other restrictions have been relaxed.   It  will bonoeded so long at any rate as food is imported by the Ministry.Furthermore it must be borne in mind that hrar time government control has in many directions  tended to bring competing traders                                                   together/
                                                                  316   I     together and so to facilitate the  formation  of  trusts,  rings  and     price agreements.    Clearly the public  must  be  protected  against     exploitation by combinations trading in foodstuffs.   This is     only one part of the profoundly important  and difficult problem     of controlling trusts after the war.4.        In connection with control of prices  special mention must bo     made of the Bread Subsidy.    I assumo that tho  price  of bread will     not in any case be allowed  to riso above 9d,  That being  so  it     seems that the bread subsidy and the Flour Mills Control  upon     which it rests must oontinue so long as the  policy of guaranteeing     minimum prices of wheat is  maintained.   The  guaranteed price  for     the American and Canadian harvests of 1919 has  been fixed at  a     point far in excess of that consistent  with  the 9d* loaf.5.        The National Kitchens  Movement should,  in  my view, continue     to be promoted by the Government.   In the  transition  period  from     War to Peace conditions,  with the  inevitable risks of unemploy-     ment, it is of the first  importance that cheap, good  food should     be easily obtainable.  It seems to me that National Kitchens  might     well be made a permanent  feature of our national life.6.        I consider that some form of  control  should continue over     the supply and distribution of Milk v/hich  is so important a food     from the point of view of public health and  of  the welfare of     childreno  Two questions  in particular, tho  position  of the     London milk supply, and the problem created  by  the extension  of     Milk trusts give ground for real anxiety.  I believe  personally     that; if a well thought out policy of control is adopted  the     support of the publio would be assured  and that tho support  of     the trade and of at least a majority of the  agricultural  community     could be obtained.   The uncertainty of the  present position is     doing considerable harm,  especially among  producers.7,        Under the regime of Control a number  of minor improvements     have been introduced which  should  in my opinion be permanently     continued ecg3 the regulations as  to sale  by nett weight, the     requirements of a standard  of quality in the case of  certain     articles otc,                                                              8c/
     I have already brought to the notice  of  the  Prime minister the excellent work of the Local Pood Control  Committees. Whetherit would be possible to make use of this  organisation after  food control has ceased I do not know/j but the  efficiency of  their work suggests that the point is worth considering.     The Ministry of Food havo naturally  been closely  interestedin the question of food production.  As  imported  supplies  improve the position will clearly be modified so  far  as the Ministry isconcerned!  The need of agricultural development,  however, willcontinue and such responsibility as the Ministry  has assumed inthis respect should devolve upon the Board of Agriculture.   Inthis.connection I trust that the scheme  of inquiring intoAgricultural Costings recently adopted by the Ministry will  bemaintained and that the interest of consumers will be  safeguardedThe Consumers1 Council should never be totally abolished.MINISTRY OF FOOD.
