V7ar Cabinet,                                                37 4^iSJALL6^^  0n tlic  llth Doconbor,  1018, I  addressed tho V/ar          Cabinet cn tho  subject  of tho. military situation in Siberia,          asking for a decision as to the  military policy to be          pursued,  having special regard to the  nothod cf employment          of the British  and  Canadian tr,troops  nor: in,  or under orders          for that  theatre.               I pressed, as  the  best alternative, that the British          and Canadian forces should bo  used  for a defensive campaign          so as to  help maintain  the present  front hold by the  Szech-          Siberian  troops..               Since the  above Paper was written,  certain -developments          have  occurred which make it imperative for  a decision to be          taken by  the &apos;.&apos;ar Cabinet without delay,   A Summary of tho          whole situation is  given in Appendix &quot;A&quot;, &quot;but the salient          features  to  be  considered are  :-               (1)   The Canadian  Government have definitely decided                      not to  send their  Contingent beyond Vladivostok.               (2)   Tho situation on the Siberian  Railway has become                      aggravated, and the  disorganization  cf the line                      is  now  such as to render precarious the main-                      tenance of  our troops which  are dependent upon                      it *  Havinr regard to past experience, to&apos; the                      divergent interests  involved, and the pressure                      of  work there will be in Paris, thero is  no                      prospect &apos;0f obtaining efficiency this Winter,                      v/hich is the critical time *               (3)   Neither the Americans  nor the  Japaneso show any                      inclination to modify their  previous policy                      and still refuse to  send any troops West  of                      Lake Baikal,   In  these circumstances we  are                      faced with  two alternatives                                                                 &apos; v .
                     &quot;                                      375        (a) either we must provide additional troops from           India or elsewhere to take the place of the           Canadian contingent in support of the two British           Battalions we now ho,ye at or about Crnek, or        (b) We must withdraw these two battalions from Siberia           altogether, leading tho Instructional Staff of           General Khox to give what assistance they can in           the organisation and training of the Russian Forces.     As it is not the intention of H.M. Government to undertake a campaign cn a largo scale against the Bolshevik forces, and inview of the unsatisfactory position of the small British force in western Siberia, liable as it is to be Isolated in the event ofa complete breakdown of the Siberian Railway, i recommend          (i)  That these two battalions, should nor be with-             dra?:n to Vladivostocko        (li)  That the Canadian Forces should be returned to             ganada, for I entirely concur in General Khox&apos;s             opinion that to keep these fine troops unemployed             at the Base will serve no useful purpose and only             lower our prestige.     I realise that such a decision cannot well &quot;be taken byH.M. Government acting alone and also that the Siberian questionis only a part of the larger problem of, Allied action) or in-action, in Russia; but I submit this Paper for the considerationof the Cabinet because of all our Russian difficulties it is,at the moment, the one requiring the earliest decision.

SECRET&quot;APPENDIX &quot;A&quot;,             MILITARY SITUATION III SIBERIA .1.   The SihGrio.ii Government hap, under arms some 97,000 troops,of which about 62,000 are holding a line which runs throughPerm in the North, and thence gonorally Southwards coveringtho line of tho Ural3; and also at tho moment covering Orenburgfrom the direction of Turkcstan*  iiixecl with this force thereare about 9,800 Czech troops, while in rear of Ekaterinburgand Ufa there arc a further 17,000 Czechs who havo lately been withdrawn from the front owing to tiredness and a certain lackof moral after many months of very hard fighting.  There arealso about 11,000 Czech troops scattered throughout Siberiaon garrison duty a   In addition, the Siberian Government hascalled to the colours! about 110,000 men of all arms who arein depots near the various largo townta along the Trans-siberian railway, hut at present are almost entirely deficient of trained officers, arras and equipment.  The organisation andequipment of these troops is to be undertaken by GeneralKhox, who says that&apos; tho material is good ond discipline fairlywell maintained a  The material for 100,000 men sent by the british Government should now bo arriving in the country?The forwarding of this equipment however, is rondcrod extreme-ly difficult by the disorganisation of the railway^ and it isnot expected that all the above materixl can possibly bo sentwestwards till the end of April at the earliest.  Without doubtconsiderable quantities of arms &amp;Co, will be diverted to troops at the front *  The despatch of any further equipment, althoughthat for another 100,000 has been sanctioned, is therefore ameasure of more than questionable utility.2.   The small Allied forces at present in the country consistof       (i) Two British, battalions numbering some 2,000 all           ranks.  Of these one is a garrison battalion                                                 consisting
                             2.                                3&apos;            consicting of low category men who have  boon            through conciderablo hardchips, and upon whom the            climate of Siberia must bo beginning to  tell            cove rely.            The Headquarters  of one battalion is at  Omsk, and            the other  battalion is  on route to that  place-,       (ii)  An armoured train with naval  guns and detachment            from EJLSo &quot;Suffolk&quot;*   This  detachment  has- been            In action  upon tho Ufa  front,  but according to latest            reports is now being withdrawn a      (iii)  The advance party numbering 1,100 of the Canadian            force  is at Vladivostock,  and the remainder of tho            contingent, como  3,400  men, is nor; cn route to that            port.       (iv)  A  French Colonial battalion,  1,100 all ranks,  with            one battery of 12 guns,  now at Cheliabinsl-u        (v)  An Italian contingent of 1,600 all ranks now in the            Ural area,       (vi)  8,500  america at vladivostock.      (vii)  58,000 Japanese troops distributed between  Lake            Baikal and  the  coast,  (it  is  believed that  the            Japanese contemplate  withdrawing  a largo number of            these  troops)-&apos;3*   As regards the prospects  on the  fighting front and in Siberia itself, the Siberians  have  recently  given proof of improvement in efficiency and moral by their unaided capture of Pern.    This  advance  can,  however, hardly lead to  important strategical results.    Tho Bolsheviks  aro  aware  that their greatest danger lies  in a union  between, the  Siberians  and Southern Russian  forces on the Vol^a.  They  are, tboroforo, probably prepared to disregard their  northern flank and con*- centratc their efforts upon  preventing the above union.   The Bolsheviks  report that thoy  have captured  Ufa  and they may pro- bably succeed  in  forcing  tho  Siberians back  to the lino  of the                                                           Urals
 Urals  and  in opening tho railway  to  Turkestan.   It  is, how- evor;  improbable,  owing to  the  severity of the winter and the  increasing  pressure to  be expected from General Denikin, that tho Siberian  troops will be  forced tc leave go their hold upon the line of the i Urals o        The latter contingency would  have  to be faced, hoc/over,  if  General Kolchakro position should become insecure  and  consequent risings take place throughout  Siberia0   Tho Czechs can no longer be relied upon for  any length  of time  to form  the- backbone of the forcoa at the  front.   Their complete withdrawal from Siberia, however, oven if desired, could not be effected for a considerable time. They can therefore b* relied upon os a bulwark of internal security for some time  to cere, though their relations  with tho Russians are not cordials 4.   The question of  housing of all forces, whether Russian or Allied,  is a matter  of considerable concern^  Newspaper reports, added  to General Knoxfs wires,  point to the utmost congestion  and  lack  of  sanitary conditions in all large Siberian centreoo  large numbers of railway wagons  are everywhere  being used by homeless refugees  and troops0  Adequate provision for the  clothing of our  troops has been made,  but this can  only alleviate the hardships inseparable from the  above conditions a 5.   As regards the railway, which is the  dominating factor in the  situation,  it is estimated that even if all civilian trans- port is entirely subordinated to military requirements3 only li trains a day will under present conditions be available forammunition, stores, supplies and transport of all troops  whether Siberian, Czech or Alliedo  Our railway  expert in Siberia points out that not the slightest benefit can accrue to the railways for some months after a decision in regard to  its managemont lias been arrived at a
