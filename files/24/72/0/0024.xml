December 1.918.CONFIDENTIAL.    I  CIRCULATE  for  the  information  of  the  Cabinet  a record of a  private conversation with M. Colijn.                                                                    L. W. E.    December 1.8, 1918.    In the course of a private conversation on the 16th December with M. Colijn, in reference to the demand that sprang up during the election for the punishment of the kaiser, he said that the Dutch  held  strictly to, and had great pride in, the right ofasylum, which they had  maintained for hundreds of years, and that he feared that theAllies might demand the giving up of the Kaiser in such a way that a discussion wouldbe entered into on the legal rights of asylum, and that the Dutch might ultimately haveto give way for fear of force.    He said that he probably knew more intimately than anyone else the mind of tiieDutch  Government in the matter.  He felt sure that if the legal question of the rightof asylum were not raised, and the Allies requested the Dutch Government to appoint a representative to  a Commission of, say, four nominated by  the  Allies, to enquire whether any  legal question did in fact  arise,  it  could  be  arranged beforehand, ifnecessary, that the Commission should report that no such legal question arose, where-upon he  felt  sure that the Dutch Government would be prepared to hand over the kaiser.  The essentials were :     First, that no question should arise as to the right of asylum, to which the Dutchattach such importance ; and    Second, that the Dutch should be associated with the decision that such a questiondid not arise.    The  Dutch would then act, not because they were forced to do so by superiorpowers, but in co-operation with  superior powers, recognising the justice of the claim that the Kaiser should be given up.[109(5]
