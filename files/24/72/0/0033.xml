[This Document is the Property of His Britannic  Majtsys Government]Printed for the War Cabinet.  December 1918.CONFIDENTIAL.         FRENCH  MINISTRY  OF  NATIONAL RECONSTITUTION.    I CIRCULATE,  for the information of my colleagues, the following memoranda on the constitution and functions of the French Ministry of National Reconstitution.                                                WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.   . December 19, 1918.                                       I.    Memorandum of an Interview between M. Loisyt representing M, Loucheur, and                   Mr. Hanson and Mr. Judd, December 4, 1918. 1. Powers and Functions.     The Ministry of Reconstitution will have practically the same powers as M. Loucheur had during the war.     The functions of the Ministry  of Armament dealing with &quot;administration &quot; (i.e., programmes, finance, contracts, &amp;c.) now revert to the War Office, but the control of materials and manufacture remain with M. Loucheur, as Minister of Reconstitution.     The demands of the various Government services, including  War Office, railways, colonies,  &amp;c, will be sent to M. Loucheur, who will decide as to how far these demands can be filled in France and how far it is necessary to order from abroad.  He will place the home orders and will pass to M,  elemental, the Minister of Commerce and Industry, demands which require to be filled abroad, including  material to  be  imported for manufacture in France.    M.  Loucheur  will control  the  allocation of materials and of labour for  home industries for such time as there is any shortage necessitating  allocation or rationing. This control extends not only to manufacture arising out of the war, but to textiles, &amp;c, as under  mentioned.    It is intended to relax or remove control in the respective industries as soon as theshortage  disappears.2. Extent of Control.    The  principal materials of export which will come under M. Loucheur will be asfollows:          Steel  and pig-iron.         Copper, zinc,  and other non-ferrous metals (excluding nickel, alloys, and ferro-            silicon, which it is  probably unnecessary to control).         Machine topls^ textile machinery, and electric plant.         Textiles,  including wool, cotton, jute, &amp;c.         Clothing and  boots.         Building materials, including bricks, lime, cement, but not stone.         Pottery and glass.         Rubber.         Resin and gums.         Timber.         Coal
      With regard to  coal it is  proposed to establish a national coal bureau with full  authority, including representatives of producers and  consumers.   It  is  hoped that  they may be able to release control of coal about April.      It is also hoped that a similar bureau night be shortly set up to deal with timber.      The  foregoing list comprises the principal materials, but is not exhaustive.      With regard to nitrates and phosphates, M. Loucheur will deal with the question  of the price of existing stocks, but the repartition of  the present stocks and of future  imports will be entirely left to the Minister of Agriculture.  3. National Factories.      M. Loucheur will retain the control and disposal of national factories.  The policy  has not yet been settled, and they cannot yet say whether the Government will continue  to hold these factories  or sell them to private firms.  4. Labour.      They divide labour  into two classes :  (a) mobilised  and (6)  free labour.  The former includes not only conscripted  labour,  but colonial and foreign  labour imported for  munitions  work; these will remain  under  the  control of M. Loucheur, who will also deal with  the distribution of labour  amongst the factories  and industries under his control.     The second class, &quot; free labour,&quot; is controlled by the Minister of Labour, M. Colliard, who will also deal with general labour regulations and rates of works.     The demobilisation will  be  carried out  according to the different age groups, and &apos; not  according to  occupation.   This demobilisation is being  carried out by the Under-Secretary of the War Department.     (Note. Local papers  state  that a&apos; Ministry  of Demobilisation was being  formed under M.  Dechamps, as an  Under-Secretary of State in  the War Department, but M.* Loisy stated that  this was not settled and should not be regarded  as correct.) &apos; 5. Finance,     M.  Loucheur has asked and,  it is understood, has  obtained financial  powers enabling him to place &quot; stop-gap &quot; orders on behalf of the Government  in order to keep employed  industries formerly engaged on war work.   He proposes to place substantial orders for  the Government,  e.g., for building  material, furniture, &amp;c,  and  will  give the firms advances to enable them to carry out these orders.   Delivery will be taken by the Government  for  sale at a later  date, e.g., as  soon as consumers will  be ready to take it.     The reinstating  of the devastated  areas  will  create a  large  demand, and the intention  is  that these  stop-gap orders  will be directed  mainly to supplying  that demand.     They also  intend to place large orders for standard civilian clothing, boots, &amp;c.     They were prepared to make advances to finance manufacturers, but only in cases where they were  working on Government orders. 6. Organisation.     M. Loisy said that the organisation  was  not definitely settled yet. but  he  hopedit would be in a very  short time, and, if we desired,  he would he glad to supply us intwo or three weeks with a chart showing the organisation ultimately arranged.                                        II. Notes of a Conversation with Colonel Mercier on the subject of the Organisation of the                        Ministry of National Reconstitution.     A telegram was received to-day from Mr. Churchill to  Mr.  Layton, asking that amemorandum should be prepared showing the organisation  and  functions of the newFrench Ministry of National Reconstitution, of which M. Loucheur is the head.     Mr.  Layton  spoke on the subject to M.  Loucheur, who said that the best way toobtain information was to speak with Colonel  Mercier and with M. Loisy.  Accordingly,I went and saw Colonel Mercier this afternoon.
       Colonel Mercier said, dealing in the first place with  the functions of the Ministeres  de rArmement, which are now transferred  to the War  Office, that the Department of  Artillery, which deals with the constitution of batteries,  that  is to say, the making up  of the establishment of each  battery with the requisite  guns, carriages, horses, &amp;c, is  now transferred  to  the War Office,  and also  the  similar  department  dealing with  chemical  warfare  and  with  mechanical transport,  but  iaat  the supervision  of the  factories which  produce the  material  for all  these services remains  with  the new  Ministry of Keconstitution.   That Ministry is a purely industrial body, and not in any  sense a military one.       The control of timber, which  has been under the Ministry  of Armament, remains  under the new Ministry of Reconstitution, aud the control of textiles, which has during  ;he  war  been under  the Ministry  of Commerce;  is transferred to the  Ministry of  Reconstitution.       M.  Loucher has also been given the special duty of arranging for the reconstruction  of damaged factories destroyed in  the occupied districts, and also the special functions  of reconstituting the industries of Alsace-Lorraine  and of  the  occupied portions of  Germany.  This implies the  supervision and control of industry generally in these  provinces. Alsace-Lorraine is French, the Rhine  Provinces are an inter-Allied affair, and  M. Loucher&apos;s control has to be exercised in concert with the Allied Governments.      General Payeur, whose department is the Inspection  of Manufacture, including  the  inspection  of manufacture in the Government arsenals, remains under M.  Loucheur.  General Mochet,  who is concerned  with the constitution  of the artillery  from  the  military point of view, returns to the War Office.      The above general description of  the  functions  of the new Ministry  ^was  sim-  plified by Colonel  Mercier in  replies to a number of  questions which Mr. Layton had  asked me to put to him.   They deal with the following points :       1.  Labour. The division  of duties as between  the Ministry  of Labour and the  new Ministry of Reconstitution is that the Labour  Ministry  has charge of all regu-  lations  and questions  relating to strikes, wages, and conditions  of labour  generally,  whether for soldiers or civilians, but M. Loucheur is responsible for dealing with  labour  questions in all the factories  which  he controls; he will act in concert and consultation  with  the Minister of Labour. The  main  classes  of  factories which M.  Loucheur  controls are the following:           Engineering in the  widest sense.          Steel and iron.          Building for factories  as distinguished from domestic building.     Textile  factories  were  not  mentioned, but it would  appear  to  follow from the first  part of  Colonel Mercier&apos;s  remarks that these also are in   M.  Loucheur&apos;s department.     The  chief matter  which  is occupying M.  Loucheur&apos;s  attention at  the present moment  is the  placing  of orders  with the  factories thrown out of  work on  war materials until fresh demands,  either from private persons or from other Government departments, come into operation to occupy the factories.     I asked what the policy  of the Ministry was  with regard to  stopping contracts for munitions and materials, and Colonel  Mercier gave me the following particulars :      (a.)  Contracts with Powder and Explosives. All   orders have  been  stopped.  The workpeople, who are mostly women, are being turned  over to work on clothing, textiles, &amp;c.     (b.)  Shells. Filling of shells has  been stopped  absolutely.  &apos;The manufacture of empty shell is still proceeding in some of the factories, and a stock  of empty shells  is thus being built  up.   The selection  of the factories is  made on  the  principle that factories employing large numbers of workpeople and factories  not ready to turn over to peace production are kept on at shells, and  those which are in  a position to  turn over to civil work at once are being  turned over.     Colonel Mercier observed that the chief difficulty  in starting work for civil purposes is the supply of raw materials.     (c.) Guns and Carriages. All  supplies of material to these factories  have been stopped.   The general principle on which the Ministry  is acting  in allowing work to proceed is, that w here guns and gun equipments will be complete^ in the coming three months the work is allowed to proceed to an  end.  Any  forgings  or  other materials which will not work into a finished equipment by  the  end  of three  months are  beingscrapped.
      Colonel Mercier hopes that he will be able to reduce the period of three months to  two for finished equipments,  and let the parts  of equipments which  are completed in  the third month form a stock of spare parts.      Colonel Mercier remarked that  in  the case  of  equipments being made for the  Americans  which would  not be  finished in  three months,  the materials  are  being-  scrapped and the French are standing the expense.      (d.) Automobiles. &quot;Work is proceeding at full.  Many waggons and cars are needed  to establish communication in the devastated areas  where railways have been damaged;  workpeople are being transferred from gun factories to automobile factories.      (e.) Railway Material. The same is the case here.   Work is proceeding at full  speed, both for manufacture and repair of locomotives,  waggons, and rails, and workmen  are being transferred from the gun factories.      (f.) Building. Engineering works belonging to the Department of Public Works,  such as  bridges, sluices,  cranes,  tugs, barges,  &amp;c.   These are  proceeding, and  endeavour is being made to increase them to make up the losses of the war.      (g.) Commercial Shipbuilding. This has  been entirely suspended during the war.  The Ministry is endeavouring to start again,  but  it is difficult to begin in the special  circumstances.      (h.) Aviation. This is one of the most difficult cases to deal with.  A number of  factories are being kept at work for military and commercial purposes, but most of them are being turned to other uses.   As the Aircraft Factories work mostly in wood, they are being turned to  the manufacture of windows, doors, tables, furniture, &amp;c.      (i.) Raw Materials of Explosives. The factories are being kept on work to produce fertilisers.  It is hoped to start the  Dye  Industry,  but there is  no immediate prospect of beginning.      (j.) Steel and Iron  Works of all kinds are being turned to civil needs,  structural steel, &amp;c.      I  asked what  the policy was  about the retention  or  disposition of National Factories.  Colonel  Mercier said that the  Government  was keeping control of them in the meantime.   The largest  single factory, that  at Rohanne, which had  three  great buildings belonging to it, would be dealt with as follows :       One-third of the premises would be kept at work on shells.     Two-thirds would be turned on to make waggons.  This was a provisional arrange- ment, and probably the two-thirds would in the future  be leased to a private  company.     As to filling factories, the Ministry  intended  to  use  them as stores for artillery waggons, &amp;c.     The old National Arsenals at Bourges and other places were being kept going.  The staff of workmen was  being  diminished, and machines were being transferred to civil factories so as gradually to bring the arsenals down to a peace  basis again.     On the subject.of American and  British  factories  erected in France, a Committee was being appointed to  consider the question.     I aiso asked certain questions of a wider  scope  about which Mr. Layton wished to have information.     What Department  is responsible  for the social side of Reconstitution, Education, Housing, &amp;c. ?     Colonel Mercier told me that the Department responsible was the Department of the  Liberated Regions, which had  been assigned to  the present  Minister of Blockade, M. Lehune, who is assisted by M.  Mauclere as Commissary General.     I further asked whether  the arrangement by which the Ministry of Reconstitution had been formed was expected to be permanent or of a  provisional character.  Colonel Mercier gave it  me as his personal opinion that the arrangement could only be pro- visional;  he thought that to  have three  Ministers,  MM.  Loucheur, Clementel, Lehune all dealing with parts of one subject would not be a  perfectly satisfactory arrangement. He further told me, in reply to a question, that the constitution of the new Ministry was not  done  in  pursuance  of a plan made before  peace, but had been arranged  after thearmistice was declared.                                                   (Signed)      P. HANSON.     December 3, 1918.o
