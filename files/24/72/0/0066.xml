POSTWAR POLICY FCR  DEFENSIVE ARMAMENT OF MERCHANT VESSELS            /3.     mLiMjms.,.I I  I       Co)memorandum by  the  Ministry of Shipping          The memorandum by the  First  Lord of  the Admiralty(G.T. 6448) cn this subject has  been read and  the ShippingController fully agrees with the  views  expressed by the Boardof Admiralty as to the desirability of rendering merchantvessels capable in future of being defensively armed as rapidly as possible in the event of war,         It is for consideration whether in the case of trampships the preparation should not be limited to stiffening forone gun,          As regards the incidence of  the cost of the necessarystiffening of new vessels,  the Ministry of Shipping considersthat convenience is all on the side of requiring this to be borneby the shipowner as part of the  cost of construction.   The amountIs trifling, but if it were borne by the Government, inspectingand accounting staffs Fould be necessary and difficulties mightfrequently arise a3 to the  actual cost Involved in particular cases, and it is therefore  recommended that &amp;n endeavour shouldbe made to secure the acquiescence of  the chipowning Associationsin this view.26th December, 1918.
