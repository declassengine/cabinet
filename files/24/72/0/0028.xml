fTHi/-&apos; DOCUHDIT  is TEB  i^oriaTY OF ab j.fit ,i.i:ic. I;l.j::IJTVro e-o^iaiauT)SECRET^                 wait  gfeSSBS        p^ioaiLi^^ior ahdjri3T?i: igo in i;iii;:iffi.Joint fk-mor-rncum by the Chief Secret: ry for Ireland  and theController-General&quot; of Demobillnation and Resettlement *      In Ireland demobilisation end resettlement present a different problem from  that which they present in O-rett Britain, and itis of the greatest importance that it should be handled in themanner end by the methods v/hich the peculiar circumstances require.      It ic probable that the numbers who will be returned toIreland, including prisoners of war., soldiers and sailors, andmunition workers in&quot;Greet Britain, Bill not exeoed IS0/000.There * ill also be the eases oi taose who are thrown out of work by dislocation oi industry and in other ways connected with the changes inevitable between a state of ear end a state of peace.      Although the numbers are not great, the whole subject willrequire very careful treatment.   The large majority of thoserno will be returned will have come from the country districts and the small country tonne.   Dublin --111, no doubt, receive alarge number of the crsual labour type, and it is probable thatit may require some, special treatment of its own.   Most of thosewho will return to Belfast will be skilled or semi-skilled andwould, no doubt, be Kimilar to those who arc returning to thebi- manufacturing centres in Great dritain.      The chief difficulties-with which re shell be met will befound among those who are returning to the.country districts..,the small country towns., and places like  /a tor ford, Cork, Maori ck,Galway,  and so on.      In Ireland political considerations are of much greater importance and much more ft. r reaching than they are in GreatBritain.   In the present state ox unrest it would be highly dangerous to have a large number of men standing about idle,however generous are the unemployed grunts;  and fo:: that reason it is essential that work of some hind should be iowwiL for them without  any delay.   It is  lso an undoubted fact that returnedsoldiers and sailors      not receive the  striotic welcome inIreland *;hioh they &quot;ill receive- in England and Scotland end-/ales, and it is of the highest importance teat everythingshould be done to let it be hnown that those who have dene their duty are receiving proper assistance. -      Strong committees are be In - formed for the reception of repatriated soldiers on their arrival.   They will feed themand&quot;despatch them to their destinations in the country.   Thenamos and residences of such men T ill be taken, and they will beinvited to communicate their names if they find any trouble or  .any difficulty in obtaining employment or wo.:h in the neighbour-hood, of their homes, the repatriated soldiers having been instruc?ted to register at the Employment 11 wchange and giving   rtfcularsof tneir Qualifications and of the work: they require.      The class of men who to likely to suffer most are men whoare in every way fitted for navvy work, - casual on dock labourersin the towns, and men brought, up, to work on the land in otherparts.,.   There is a considerable amount of work to which such men can oe set,  . rioads, are &quot;badly in need of repair and that work - which mn.st.be done as. soon as possible -&quot;would provide for
 &amp; considerable number  of then.       In ad1&apos;, it ion both the  ijstutes  Coa^issioners  and  the  Congested districts Beard hays estates  which  require  clearing on many of Which there  is a  l&amp;rpe amount or  timber v/liich make&amp;t be felled, and the  estates woult.  then  require  to  be prepared for division into farm holdings.       It is proposed as  far as possible to  use unemployed returned men for  this  purpose, ,anc if  the  Fork  can be  commenced at once it  will  be very useful because the  firewood obtained  when the tress are felled is  much required  or/in?  to  the shortage of fuel,  and the logs themselves would be  preparing to be  sawn and cut up in the spring and summeri       In rddition it woulf.  be very  valuable if propaganda work could be carried  on to  induce people,to employ returned soldiers and sailors.    ffhie can  be  started  at  once  by the propaganda depart-  ment of the  Irish fiecruiting Council.       The Irish Government, after full consideration, have  come to  the conclusion that z separate Irish body  should deal  with these peculiar Irish circumstances  and conditions.   There  is in existence in  the  organisation of  the Irish  recruiting Council, which is  spread all over the  country,  an instrument which is peculiarly fitted  to undertake the  -Ork.       The  Irish Government  propose  that the Chief Secretary  should be  empowered  to appoint  an  Irish Director of Demobilisation  and Resettlement end  that he should be  assisted by a Board consisting1 of  the Irish iiecruiting  Council and such other persons as were deemed neeesaary,   Such persons vo  uld include a representative nominated  by  the Controller-General of Demobilisation and Resettle- raent.    The latter is responsible for the administration  of  the Ac-os  relating  to Labour Lxchangos, Unemployment Insurance, etc,, ana as the handling: of Labour questions will be one of the chief duties,  if not  the chief duty of the Board,  it is essential  that the Controller-General should be directly represented upon it. Thus  consistency between the activities of  the Board and  those of  the Controller-General1s Department will be secured and the Government i ould not be involved in a. labour policy in Ireland widely divergent from that  . wopted in Great nwitain.    It -ill be  realised that many of the &quot;hrwlish Trade  Unions have branches in  Ireland.    ihe labour questions necessarily involved in the problem of Demobilisation and Resettlement require a considerableknowledge of Trade Union organisation and opinions and an intimate experience of  the administrative machinery set up under the variousActs-of Parliament for  dealing with labour matters.      The special duties of the  nominee of the Controller- General on the  ,oar&amp; would be broadly as  follows :-       (a) To  keep the  Board closely informed of the  policy and          plans of tiie  Controller-General.      (b) To  keep the  Controller-General informed as  to  the          progress of  demobilisation and  resettlement,  and as          to  the plans  adopted for dealing with it&apos;,  in Ireland.      (c) To  bring; before the  Board  the observations  and sugges-          tions of the  Divisional Officer in regard  to the vorlc          of  the lizchanges.(d)  To  advise the  Board on  tho  technical and  administrative    aspects  of the labour questions.
The nominee of the Controller-General on the Board would not take any executive action independently of the  Board. If ? were in disagreement with the Board on a matter of importance affecting the Controller-General&apos;s Department he would be able to report the circumstances to the Controller-General and the final decision on the matter would rest with the Chief Secretary.

The Director of the Board would, of course, require a staff, but it would not be a large staff, and probably  could be ? from these departments, e.g National Service, which wil be disbanded. The Director, the Controller-General&apos;s nominee and some at least of the Board would have to be paid men. The essential thing is that the Director and the Board should be able to act without loss of time. Their propaganda work might be financed out of the Vote for the Ministry of Labour, but it would be necessary that a sum of money should be decided upon up to which they might incur immediate expenditure without ? to obtain Treasury Sanction. Some of the expenditure might be unreproductive, but some, such as the expenditure on the felling of trees and the clearing of estates would eventually return.
