                     Jjm  Document Is SECRET.          JWsjJr^^S- CA-*i%\  MINISTRY   OF   FOOD.) T^\*J  &amp;-  P^eporjtv/or Week ending  Wednesday, Lecember 18,  1918.                        PART L-ACTION  TAKEN.     The Food Council. Sir A. Anderson reported&quot;that a deputation had been receivedwhich  asked for information on the policy of the Ministry as regards  the  NationalKitchens&apos; movement.  It was agreed that  it was desirable that the movement shouldbe continued with vigour by local  authorities as an insurance against  unfavourableeventualities.  In the event of unemployment assuming serious proportions during the transition  period from  war to peace  conditions National Kitchens  should be ofmaterial value in providing good and substantial food at very moderate prices.     In view of the amount of meat stocks available, the Food Council have decided toadvise the Food Controller to authorise the increase of the value of the meat couponsfrom id. to 5d. each, which is equivalent to  an increase from 16 ozs. to 19  ozs. perweek.   The  change will take effect as from Sunday, December 29th.  -     Mr. Beveridge reported that, subject to a guarantee of equitable distribution being obtained from the trade, jam would be freed from the coupon at an early date.     The Council have authorised the Tea Branch to make arrangements for the releaseof tea from Government stock for export up to 10,000,000 lbs.     The following decisions were made by the Council with regard to the potato flakescheme :      (a) Three factories to be set up at Ramsey, Wisbech,  and Holbech.     (6) A scheme for disposal of surplus machinery in the hands of the &quot;Ministry to be          prepared.     (c)  No  further  factories to be set up unless either of the Boards of Agriculture          desire it.     In view of the surplus stocks of potatoes available for export Mr. Beveridge was instructed to communicate with the Treasury as to the  terms for  the  sale of  some200,000 tons to France.     It has been decided that the sampling of damaged wheat by grain officers shouldbe discontinued at once  and that the grain officers should  be dispensed with not later than the end of February.     The Home Supplies Board. The question of revoking the Pig (Sales) Order wasconsidered.  It was agreed-     fa)  that, as from December 29th, pork shall be  free of the ration ;     (6)  that the retail price of pork be reduced by 2d. per lb.;     (c)  that  in the  event of  the bacon curers  being unable  to  run  their  factories          without further assistance, the Ministry  might consider  the  possibility of          differentiating between the wholesale price of English and American bacon          and of increasing the retail price  of all bacon.     Subject  to  the  concurrence of the bacon curers  the  Pig  (Sales) Order will be revoked.     The Board had before them a letter from the President of the Board of Agriculturerequesting a statement of the policy of the Food Controller with regard  to the potatocrop for 1919. While taking the view that  it would  be  inadvisable for the ministry to undertake  to purchase the crop, or to guarantee a minimum  price  which mighthave to be maintained by Government purchase or subsidy, the Home Supplies Boardagreed that it would not be possible to undertake in advance that  the price should beleft uncontrolled.  It was  decided to reply  to the Board of Agriculture that in theevent of the interests.of the consumer requiring that the price of potatoes in 1919 be controlled, the maximum price fixed  shall  enable the grower to obtain  not less than11. per ton.    It has been decided that, the price of 2nd and 3rd grade  cattle shall he raisedduring the spring months in proportion to the prices of 1st grade cattle.     The Imports Board. The  Board have reviewed the  programme  of proposedimports from Australasia for the first four months of 1919 in the light of the improved    A (33)7008-3  Pk9  150  12/18  E&amp;S                                          A
  shipping situation.  During these first four months it is hoped that it will be possible  to ship to the United Kingdom about 62,550 tons  of meat, 28,800 tons of butter, and  35,630 tons of cheese, in addition to 2,900 tons of  cheese to Egypt.      The supplies of  meat available from the  United States in  December are only  7,000 tons instead of the 20,000 tons which was the proposed purchasing order.  In  view of the position as to stocks it is proposed to cease buying in  the United States,  but to take from 3,000 to 5,000 tons per month from Canada.      It is hoped to obtain increased supplies of feeding-stuffs  from the United  States  provided the agreement of the United States Food Administration is obtained.      A  cable has been sent to the  Allied  Provisions Export Commission authorising  the purchase out of the agreed credits of such further quantities of dried fruits as may  be obtainable,  first  preference  being  given to  raisins  and  second preference to  sultanas.      The Central Agricultural  Advisory  Council. The  Council met  on  the 17th  December/ The future control of home-produced cereals was considered and it was  decided to  ask  the  President of the Board of Agriculture  to make another public  announcement of the cereal prices guaranteed for next year;  the suggestion that rye  should  be released from control was approved.      With  regard to the whole  question  of de-control the  following resolution was  carried :             &quot; That in view of the action  and  inter-action of all forms of agricultural        produce upon the price of any one  of  them, and  of the position of producers,        it is essential that  the removal of Government  control  of  such prices  be        considered as a whole, and not piecemeal, and that a  committee  be appointed        by the departments concerned, on which this Council should be well represented,        to consider the whole  question  of de-control  of home-produced  agricultural        produce, and to report.&quot;      It  was decided  to  invite  the National Agricultural   Labourers&apos;  Union,  the agricultural section of the British Workers&apos; Union, and  the Scottish Farm Servants&apos; Union, to nominate two members each to the Council to  represent  the  agricultural labourers as food producers.     The Consumers&apos;  Council.  The  Council met on December 18th.  After prolonged discussion the question of freeing jam and margarine from the coupon was postponed for further consideration.   Alderman Spencer made a statement to the Council about the National Kitchens&apos; movement.   He dwelt upon the  difficulties his department had had to face  owing to obstruction by town councils and trades members of  councils, and also upon the difficulty of procuring  suitable  premises.  He promised to prepare a memorandum giving further information to the Council,     Resolutions 5 and 6 passed by the Legalisation  of Improvements Committee, which had been referred back were now re-submitted as follows, and were both agreed :-     (5) &quot; This Sub-Committee is of opinion that, so far as is  reasonably possible, the           price of staple articles of food sold in any shop shall be exhibited in a place           where it is easily visible to a customer.&quot;     (6)  &quot;This Sub-committee  approves  of the establishment of national  distributing           kitchens and national restaurants and is of opinion, that the system should           be continued and extended.&quot;                                 FREIGHT RATES.     The effect of the reduction in rates of freight consequent on the Armistice and of the practical abolition of war risk has  been engaging the careful attention  of the Ministry.     The great bulk of the commodities  controlled by the Ministry are carried  at Government stores rates.  The Ministry of Shipping has issued a revised  list  of these rates which came into operation on December 15th  ; the list shows a very substantial reduction, particularly in the nearer trade  routes, and as the commodities  affected are bought on an f.o.b. basis the decrease in freight and insurance rates will  be reflected in a  corresponding reduction  in  the  landed cost  to  the  Ministry.  In  most cases, however, the reduction in the freight rates  Avill not make an appreciable difference in retail prices.  In the case of bacon, for instance, although the reduction in the north american freight rates amounts to nearly 50 per cent., the saving represents less thana farthing per lb.
    As regards meat, in addition to reduced freight rates and  abolition  of  war riskthere  is a further favourable factor in the greatly increased  shipments anticipatedfrom Australia and New Zealand.  It  is hoped that over 40,000  tons may be  lifted inMarch against an average  shipment of only 2,000 tons for the  months December toFebruary.  Importations of  higher-priced American meat will  be on a diminishingscale from December onwards.    As regards commercial rates it is understood that the British lines generally aremaking an all-round reduction of 25 per cent, to operate in the case of North  Americafrom December 1st.  Where goods are taken over by the Ministry  on arrival the pricecan be varied in accordance with the freight rates actually paid.  This course is being adopted in the  case of oleaginous materials  from West Africa.   When, however,control operates only by way of fixed or maximum prices, the adjustment  of  theseprices  to conform to the  downward  movement  of  freight rates  presents a  difficult problem.  In the case of apples from North America a maximum price has been fixedto accord with the commercial rates at present  prevailing on British  tonnage, but theOrder provides that prices will be reviewed as and when freight rates fall.    In some exporting countries the rates are  primarily governed  by the  freightsobtainable by &quot;neutral or other competing tonnage.   Sharp falls  have occurred, and  it&apos;is obvious that there is a clanger  that  these, instead  of  benefiting  the consumer,  mayoperate only either to increase the profit of the exporter  on his f.o.b.  price or  of theimporter or middleman here.   Close  co-operation  with the Ministry of Shipping  isbeing maintained so that the fullest information in  respect of market conditions maybe available  in  order  that  prices may  be altered  as and when required.   In thecase of oranges  from Spain  the  maximum price is being lowered 2d. per  lb. from december 30th.   The rate for currants from  Greece  ruled at 350s. at the beginningof November and has fluctuated violently since the Armistice.   The Ministry are nowcalculating on a rate of 200s., and have dropped the price by 14s. Qd.  per cwt.                                    SUPPLIES.    Fish, A consignment of  frozen  fish has  arrived under the arrangements  madewith Newfoundland.  The quality of the fish, is very good, and  is  finding  a  readymarket.    Landings of wet fish, generally are light, and very much below the  demand.  Itis hoped that the release of trawlers from Naval Service, and demobilization of men,will lead to. heavier supplies being available at  an early date.    Fruit-Two vessels have arrived with  apples-the &quot; Belgic,&quot; from  New York,and the &quot; Wincote,&quot; from Halifax.   These are now discharging, but the consignmentsare not heavy.   Further vessels are  on the way, and a moderate  supply of  applesshould be available in time for Christmas.  The  market for both  oranges and lemonshas broken, and as a result lemons are  now selling at a price which little more thancovers the cost of freight.   Oranges are also being sold in some snops at 2d. per lb.below  the  maximum  price, and supplies  of  both  fruit are  plentiful.  A furtherquantity  of Egyptian  dates has  reached  the  United  Kingdom, making  a  totalof approximately  400  tons.  About  9 tons  of  Valencia raisins have  arrived  atSouthampton, and further quantities  are expected  shortly.  Additional freight willbe provided by the Ministry  of Shipping for importing currants from Greece early inthe new year.    Meat. Reports received from the Live Stock Commissioners show that there is atendency in  many parts of  the  country for the  public to become restive under the limitations imposed by food control, and to  expect  a  more rapid  improvement in thesituation than is justified by the facts.   So far as  meat is concerned, it does not appearthat it will be possible to remove control for some time  to come.   The  position asregards supplies is still very far from stable ;  the comparatively plentiful  supplies of live stock which were available in the  beginning  of  December have now disappeared,and difficulty is being experienced  in furnishing, enough home-killed  meat to fill a double ration in the  large industrial centres.  There is, however,  considerable  doubt as to whether the full  double  ration will be  taken by the public at the  prices nowruling.  The stock of  frozen  meat is very satisfactory, the  stores are full,  evenincluding those  small provincial stores which  have not  hitherto  been consideredsuitable for  frozen meat;  in this way the difficulty with regard  to cold storage hasbeen surmounted.
     It will probably be possible to remove entirely the restrictions placed on the supply of cattle from Ireland by the beginning of 1919,     As from Sunday the 29th December, all the following classes of  meat will be free of  the coupon : Pork, horseflesh, canned, potted and preserved meats, and canned, potted or preserved game.     Milk. On the whole no reports of *ery serious shortage have at present reached the Ministry.   On the  other hand, weekly reports received from  Commissioners for the week ending 14th December indicate, that while the situation in agricultural areas is satisfactory (eg., in  the  south-west  it is stated, that more milk  is  being produced than this time last year)  industrial districts  are suffering from  shortage.  This  is attributed principally to shortage of feeding-stuffs.  It must be remembered too that the weather has been exceptionally mild for the time of year and that a sudden fall in supplies must  be expected as soon as  hard weather  sets in and cattle can no longer feed in the open.  The following  measures have been taken :      (1)  A scheme has been  worked out whereby Food Control Committees in whose           districts there is a shortage of milk  will, in their  discretion, be able to           enforce registration of customers,  thus  preventing purchase from  more           than one retailer.  The need for giving priority in the available supplies           to children and invalids is also receiving renewed emphasis.     (2)  Further reductions have  been  arranged in the quantity of  milk  used for the           manufacture of condensed  milk and other milk products.  A  considerable           volume of liquid milk is  thus being made available for  consumption.     (3)  Steps have been taken to improve the distribution of  the large supplies of           condensed  milk  which  the  Ministry  now  has available, so that  these           supplies will provide  a useful supplement in  districts  where liquid  milk           is short.     (4)  The Food Commissioners have been provided with statistics  showing for each           Food Control Committee  District  (a)  the  quota of  the available supplies           of liquid milk  which should, on  an  equitable division,  be  assigned to           the district; (b) the quantities of  condensed milk going into the district           under the Condensed Milk Distribution Scheme.     (5)  The  Milk  Control  Board  has now  been strengthened by  the addition of           the following  members : Mr.  Reginald  Butler, United Dairies,  Ltd.;           Mr. Alexander Steel, Agricultural Organisation Society; Mr. W. T. Iiarri-           son,  Birmingham Dairy  Co.,  Ltd.  The  expert knowledge of the  trade           thus put at the  disposal of the Milk Board will be of great value.   The           Consumers&apos; Council also have to-day nominated a representative.    (6) An order is about to be placed with Woolwich Arsenal for the manufacture           of a new type of 10-gallon churn which has been approved by representa- ,          tives of the trade and  is thought to be more convenient in every way than           the types at present in use.    (7) The Milk Board have considered the question of  improving  the  transport of           milk.   There is  reason to  believe  that milk  is often  sent unnecessarily          long journeys which leads to souring, and also  that  in some cases milk is           simultaneously  imported to and exported from the same district.   The           Railway Executive  Committee have,  therefore, been  asked  to  provide          particulars of cases in  which milk  is sent by rail for more than 75  miles           (120 miles in the case  of  milk sent to  London).  Arrangements have also           been made  by  which wholesale firms desiring  to  buy  motor lorries to           improve the collection  and distribution of milk  will be  put in touch  with          the army depots at which large  numbers  of second-hand lorries are now          being sold.               ORDERS UNDER DEFENCE OF THE REALM REGULATIONS.    (1) The Canned Condensed Milk (Maximum  Prices) (Ireland)  Order, 191.8, dated7th December 1918.  The operation of this Order is postponed from  7th December to14th January 1919.    (2) Order dated 12th December 1918, amending the Bacon, Ham, and Lard (Prices)Order,  1918 ; and    (3) Order  dated  12th  December 1918, amending the Bacon,  Ham, and  Lard(Provisional Prices) Amendment Order, 1918.          These Orders make various  changes in detail  in  the wholesale prices of      bacon.
              PART II.-SUMMARY  OF  THE  FOOD POSITION.                                    IMPORTS.     For the third week in succession the total imports of  the  principal food  and feeding-stuffs have,  in  the week ended 14th December (.181,900 tons), been within 1 per cent, of the average of the preceding weeks of the calendar year (181,600 tons), and of the cereal year (181,800 tons).     The  most notable  feature of the week&apos;s imports is the large import of meat (27,000 tons, including 6,500 tons canned meat) which has only been exceeded during the years 1916 to 1918 on two occasions, namely, in the weeks ended 20th October 1917 and 23rd February 1918.  On the other hand, sugar imports (4,700 tons) were,lower than in any week during the  years  1916 to 1918 with the single exception of the week ended  20th October 1917.   There  were  again good imports of wheat  and flour (111,000 tons as equivalent grain), and fair imports of rice (3,400 tons), and oats (12,300 tons), but  maize (5,300 tons) and barley (1,200 tons) though, improving were    A 7008-3                                                               -     (4) The Meat (Dealers&apos; Restriction) Order, 1918. dated  12th  December 1918, gives effect to &quot;the present permit system.  It revokes the  Meat (Retailers&apos; Restriction) Order,  lyl8,  and  provides  for the  issue of permits enabling wholesale and retail dealers to purchase supplies of live stock and meat.     (5) Order dated  12th December 1918, amending the Flour and Bread (Prices) Order, 191.7, prohibits the use of flour  for  precluded purposes except under licence, and defines the expression &quot;precluded purpose.&quot;  It gives legal effect to the existing practice.     (6) The Potatoes (Consolidation) No. 2  Order, 1918, dated  12th December 1918, relaxes the Government  control  of potatoes. &apos; The Potato Distribution  Scheme is modified, and greater latitude is  given on sales by growers and  on dealings by wholesale or retail.     (7) The Canned Meat (Distribution)  Order, 1918, dated 13th December 1918, gives power to the Food  Controller  to  issue  directions  as  to the  distribution of  canned meats.     (8) The Manufacture of Flour  and Bread Order, 1918, dated 16th December 1918, revokes the Manufacture of  Flour  and  Bread Orders, 1917, and  substitutes  a single Order giving effect to the recent changes in milling and the use of imported flour.     (9) The  Syrup,  Liquid Glucose,  and Molasses (Prices)  Order,  1918, dated 16th December 1918, provides for an intermediate profit in  molasses to those  who buy from persons other than manufacturers  or importers.     (10) The  Cream  Order, 1918, dated 16th December  1918, controls  the use of cream by children and invalids.  Cream may be supplied to invalids and  to children under the age of five up to half a pint weekly on authority issued by a Food Control Committee to the supplier.                            ENFORCEMENT OF ORDERS.    The total  number  of prosecutions recorded  in  the past  week is  817, with 727 convictions.  Prosecutions were conducted  under 57 Orders, the greatest numberof proceedings being taken under :  the Flour Restriction  (Ireland) Order,  1918 ;  the Rationing Order, 1918 ; the Grain (Prices)  Order, 1918 ;  the  Apple and Perry Pears(Sales) Order,  1918 ;  and the Tea (Retail Prices) Order, 1918.    Two sentences of imprisonment were imposed under the  Rationing  Order.   AtCamberwell a woman  was found guilty  of  obtaining a child&apos;s  ration  book to which she had no right.  She was sentenced to one month&apos;s imprisonment.  A sentence of21 days&apos; imprisonment was imposed on a woman at Peckham for unlawfully obtainingration books for her husband and child who  were not living with her.    The British and Argentine Meat Company were again prosecuted, this time at  the glasgow branch.  There were 60 charges for having put in false requisitions, withthe  result that during a period of three months  24,0001. worth of meat in excess ofthe  correct allowance had been received.
still very low.  Bacon (7,800 tons), lard (1,200 tons), and condensed milk (1,100 tons)show  a decrease  compared  with the preceding week and  are below the  average.The imports of butter (2,300 tons) are improvino- as also are  those of cocoa (1,900tons) and coffee (500 tons).  Tea  imports (2,600 tons) were  slightly below  the con-sumption requirements.   As regards fruit, there were greatly  improved  imports oforanges  (7,700 tons),  lemons (4,000 tons),  and bananas  (1,700 tons), and  the firstsupply of apples (500 tons) arrived.    The total, imports  for  the first 15 weeks of the  cereal years  1917-18  and1918-19 are compared in  the following table : Total Imports for the first 15 weeks of cereal year. 	1917.	1918.

Bread and Flour. The bakers&apos; returns for the four weeks ended December 7thshow a slight fall in the quantity of flour used  for bread and sold retail.  The rate of consumption indicated by the returns, which had reached a high level in October, hasnow declined  to the normal level for December  (Table C (2)).  The market reportsstate that neither bakers nor millers are purchasing up to a  winter standard,  and thisis consistent with the fact that the large decrease shown in  the millers&apos; deliveries-of flour (Table  B (1)), has been accompanied by a fall in the stock of, flour&apos;held by bakers,probably in  anticipation of a further improvement in quality.    The returns made by  biscuit manufacturers show that  the cancellation of Armycontracts has led to a very sudden and marked  fall in production, amounting to 27 percent, in the total quantity of flour used, or 57 per cent, in flour used  for government contracts.    Meat. The number of cattle and sheep slaughtered in Great Britian for civilian consumption in the week  ending 7th December showed a considerable increase onpreceding weeks.  The explanation lies in the  unequal distribution of supplies owingto farmers holding back live stock in the last week of November to obtain the higher,December price.   Issues of imported meat also rose from  3,000 tons to 3,500  tons.Total supplies in the preceding week, however, were low and the quantity shown forthe week under review should be distributed for ration purposes over  a longer period.It will be noted that United Kingdom consumption over a period of 4 weeks  remainssteady (Table B (1)).                                    STOCKS.  .  The rise in the imports of refrigerated meat and the consumption of home-grownmeat have resulted in a further increase in the meat stocks  from 106,600 tons on the30th November  to 109,900 tons on the  7th  December (or including  canned  meat135,100 tons), which is  the highest stock recorded since 1st September 1914.   the stocks  of lard also have been enlarged by 1,200 tons.  The  stocks of other foodshave  generally been  drawn  upon, condensed milk  in  particular  to  the  extent of6,300  tons.    The Ministry storage of bacon has been further reduced since the 30th November(22,900 tons) to 20,000 tons on 7th December, and  to 18,100 tons on 14th December;while  lard reached its maximum on December  7th at 29,400 tons, the quantity storedon the 1.4th December being 28,000 tons,
PRICES.
