ALLIED,  j^uTRAL AND&apos;]^S3!^&quot;C0u^TRIhJS.      Note by Mr.W.M,Hughes.        Referring &quot;to Lord Reading^ note of 14th reccmber, 19lO,(G.T.  434)  I am unable to agree on behalf of Australia, tothe recommendations therein;  particularly Clause 8 (Appendix A),which relates to the disposal of exportable surpluses of food in exporting countries;  as it does not provide for safeguarding the interests of Australia.        My reasons for this view were set out by me to lord reading at the meeting of the Commission to which representativesof the Dominions were sominoned.        It must therefore be understood that any arrangementsmade for the supply of food from Australia must be subject to theapproval of the Government of the Commonwealth.                      (Signed)  W. M. HUGHES.Australia House,    Strand, London, &apos;7.C*2.        21st December, 1918.
