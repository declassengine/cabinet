C.THI3 DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)v. ?ASECRET.WAR CABINETGcT . 6126,MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND POOR LAW.Copy of a letter from the Joint Committee- ofApproved Societies, to the Secretary, War Cabinet,covering copy of a letter to the Prime Minister.112 City Road,London, E.O. 1.25th October, 1918.Sir,Referring to my previous communications on this subject, Ibeg to send herewith Qopy of a letter v/hioh has been addressedto the Prime Minister on the subject of Sir Kingsiey Wood&apos;8 ?o-called &quot;memorial&quot; or &quot;manifesto&quot; in alleged support of theintroduction of a Bill in the form projected by the CabinetCommittee on Home Affairs.Since the en&amp;losed letter was written the Rev. J. 3s*ottLidgett, M.A., D.D. (another of Sir Kingsley Wood&apos;a &quot;memorialists&quot;)has written:&quot;The Manifesto I signed in favour of tho immediate estab-lishment of a Ministry of Health was,  of course, notintended,  so far as I am concerned,  to associate thehealth service of the Country in any way with theexisting administration of the Poor Law.   I agree withyou that any- such association would have most seriousconsequences,   The promotion of the public health is avital interest of the whole community, and must in noway be entangled with the problem of destitution.&quot;Lady St.Helier (another &quot;memorialist&quot;) voted yesterdayat the London Insurance Committee in support of a resolutionrecording &quot;its emphatic protest against the intention of theGovernment to incorporate into the Ministry of Health thefunctions of the Local Government Board relating to the admin-istration of the non-medical side of the Poor Law.&quot;I am desired to add, in view of what was stated in theHouse on Wednesday last, that having had both the draft Bill andthe proposed Declaration of Po?,icy laid before them by. Dr.Addison, and having declined to accept the same, the FriendlyScoieties are not open to abate their opposition to the Gcvern-ment proposals as&apos; tho result of mere disoussion of those prc-posals in the House.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,(Sgd.)   P. ROCKLIFF.Sir Maurice Hankey,Sec to the War Cabinet,Whitehall Gardens,SV7. 1.
JOINT   COMMITTEE   OF   APPROVED   SOCIETIES,-112, City Road,LONDON, l.C.1.24th October, 191S.The Rt. Hen,D. Lloyd George, M.P.,10, Downing Street, S.Y/.1.Sir,Referring to my previous communications on the subjectof the proposed Ministry of Health Bill in its relation to PoorLaw,.I am desired to bring to your notice the true character ofthe so called Memorial * or &quot;manifesto1 prepared by Sir KingsleyWood and forwarded, to you some time since.That document was signed (inter alia) by Lord Sydenham,Sir Edward Brabrook and Mrs. H.B. Irving.   In the notice circulatedto the Press (at the instance of Sir Kingsley) of the issue andpresentation of this document, prominence is given to the factthat Sir Edward Erabrook was formerly Chief Registrar of FriendlySocieties, and the inferenoe to be drawn from this was eitherthat the Friendly Societies concurred in the document, or .thatat least there was divergence of view among the societies ortheir leaders on- the subject of- the establishment of the Ministry,and its work.When issuing this document and oomivunieating it toyourself and the Cabinet, Sir Kingsley Wood was well aware thatit was proposed to incorporate in the Ministry of Health thewhole of the functions of the Local Government Board with respectto the poor Law, without any provision in.the Bill for theelimination from the Ministry of the non-medical side thereof,and that atrong objection had been taken thereto on the partof-the Friendly Societies.Apparently however, he withheld such knowledge fromthose whom he asked to sign the document, which purported toaffirm that the Country &quot;gladly welcomed&quot; the fact that the HomeAffairs Committee had placed the Ministry of Health before the.,ar Cabinet and to call for the introduction into Parliament ofthe measure without further deley.Recently at the instance of the Friendly Societies aletter was addressed to the signatories setting out the viewswhich the Friendly Societies and Trade Unions of the Countryhold in regard to the proposals of the Minister of Reconstructionand the Committee on Home Affairs with respeot to the inclusionof poor Lav/ within the ministry of Health - with which viewsyou have already been made fully acquainted.
1012.tHt.Hon.D. Lloyd George,M.P.24th October, 1918.As a result the following letters have up to theI present been received from Lord Sydenhara, Sir* Edward Brabrookland Mrs. H.B. Irving, all strongly supporting the point of viewI of the Friendly Societies and&apos;indicating the undesirability ofj introducing a Bill on the lined laid down by Sir. George,Cave&apos;s1 Committee.The Friendly Societies strongly protest against theI nature of the impression which Sir. Kingsley WoodVa action waaI calculated to create in the minds both of the Government and theJpublic on this matter, and they will take an opportunity ofj voicing their feelings in regard thereto at the allied Friendly&quot;Society and Labour Demonstration against the incorporation in thej., Ministry of Health Bill of the functions of the Local GovernmentjBoard relating to the administration of the Poor Law (non-medical),I to be held in the Central Hall Westminster on 2nd December next.Sir Kingsley Wood is not connected with the FriendlyI&apos;j Society movement; he possesses no claim to voice their opinionsorI authority to represent their views.   Nor do even-the Executive ofI the Industrial Assurance Companies regard him as entitled to apeakI for them, since he is not a member of their Conference, and theI real views of Sir. Kingsley&apos;s own ^memorialists&apos; are aa under;I Lord Sydenham:&quot;I agree generally with;your views, and I think that tomix up the work of the Friendly. Societies with the PoorLaw would be a fatal mistake..   The. recommendation8 of thePoor Law Commission have never been carried out, and aomechanges in our Local Government system will be needed.I am not sure whether, as, I suggested in the House of Lords,it would not be best to abandon medical benefit altogetherand replace i.t by a national system providing forchildren as well as for adults and absolutely free fromthe taint of the Poor Law.     I do not know what the BillIill contain, but if it is anything like your forecast Icertainly could not support it,*    I am anxious for theestablishment of a Ministry of Health; but, if it meansonly adding the functions of the Insurance Commissionersto those of the Local Government Board, I think we shouldbe better without it.   I can only hope that the difficul-ties of the subject have been mastered by someone and that??e shall at least have a Bill which lays a sound foundationfor future building and is not open to the criticisms youhave kindly sent me.&quot;ISir Edward Brabrook, C.B.&quot;I entirely concur v,ith the Friendly Societies in theview they entertain.as to the importance of keeping theproposed Ministry of Health apart from the Poor Law.   Sofar back aa.1898, I expressed my opinion that FriendlySocieties and the Poor Law have no common ground of0 contact.     It is much to be hoped that, the new Ministrywill be established on.auch,lines that the VoluntaryInstitutions of the country may co-operate.with it tothe general advantage.&quot;.
1 f\ 91 V (jtm   j*l    mThe P$.Hon. 24th October, 1918,D. Lloyd, George. M,p,Mrs, H.B. Irving:&quot;I am absolutely averse to tho now Ministry of Health&quot;being associated with tho Poor Lav/;&apos;,&apos; &quot; I have been aPoor Law Guardian for six years for the purpose ofstudying the whole subject and I quite.agree that every. effort should bo made to prevent the. Ministry cf Healthfrom being contaminated with Poor Law methods.&quot;It uill also be rf interest to you to learn that at thoAnnual Conference last Friday of the National Association ofInsurance Committees, the-.delegates throw over the abstractresolution put before them by officials of the organisation whohad been negotiating with Dr.Addison (the Treasurer happcns.to.behis Parliamentary Secretary) and insisted On passing a resolutiondemanding that the Ministry of Health should be established apartfrom the Local Government Beard and that it should be dissociatedfrom the Poor Law.   . .:Mr. J&apos;,p.,&apos;Nugent M&apos;.P. the Secretary of the largestApproved Society in Ireland,, and who represents the views of theIrish Party on this subject, declared on the 22nd inst. that heagreed with the protest of the Friendly Societies, against thepresent draft Bill creating a Ministry of Health and was entirelyopposed tc any Bill except one creating an independent Ministrywhich would be free from all interference by Local GovernmentBoards.Ifr, Theodore Taylor M.P. - a large. Employer of Labour.-also declared on the 16th inst, that he&apos;was in favour of the totalexclusion of the non-health side of the Poor Lav; from the newMinistry and that he was against an amendment aiming at its earlyelimination for the reason that, once admitted as part of thefunctions of the Ministry it would be very difficult to get itdivorced therefrom. .  In this connection I may say that the Execu-tive of tho National Federation of Employers Provident:Funds aremeeting to-day in Birmingham to organise,a campaign i\n the work-shops &quot;throughout the Country against the Government proposal tolink Poor Law administration with the Ministry-of Health.The importanoe of the matter to. the Societies concernedmust be my apology for troubling you at this length at this junc-ture, but I venture to think that the facts herein detailed addpoint to the request already put before you by the Societies, fora thorough reconsideration cf the question before any Bill/by thoWar Cabinet and introduced into the House,   . is passedI am, Sir,.Your obedient Servant, - .P; KOCKLIFF.
