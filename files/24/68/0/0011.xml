23rd October, 1918.That such a Bill should be passed without any delay is amatter of urgency for the following reasons;.-First, because the Select Committee say that the adoptionof some definite principle by which the date of the end of the warcan be determined is necessary in order to enable them usefully toconsider the second part of their terms of reference.Secondly, because if, before an authoritative declarationhas been made defining the termination of the war, any event shouldhappen (such, for example, as a permanent cessation of hostilities)which might not unreasonably be regarded as the end of the war,great uncertainly would be likely to prevail, and confusion andInconvenience would follow.For these reasons I submit that immediate directions shouldbC&apos;given by the War Cabinet for a Bill to be prepared and submittedto Parliament as recommended In the annexed Report of the SelectCommittee.C, Addison.

FfRST  REPORTThe SELECT COMMITTEE appointed to take into consideration the Report of Mr. JusticeAtkin&apos;s Committee, and matters connected therewith, and to report what provision should bemade by Parliament for defining the meaning of the phrase &quot;END 01 THE WAR&quot; andother similar phrases occurring in the WAR EMERGENCY STATUTES and for extendingin whole or in part or shortening the period of operation of the several Emergency Statutesand the several regulations made thereunder, HAVE agreed to the following FIRSTREPORT:-1. According to our terms of reference we have taken into consideration the Report of Mr.Justice Atkin&apos;s Committee appointed to consider the legal interpretation of the term &quot; period ofthe war.&quot; *2. So far as regards the first part of our terms of reference we now present an Interim Reportstating that we agree with the view expressed in the First Interim Report of Mr. Justice AtkmsCommittee, that the date of the end of the war in relation to the powers conferred by EmergencyLegislation should be held to be the date when the treaty of peace is finally binding on therespective belligerent parties, that is, the date when ratifications of the treaty are exchanged ordeposited.3. This proceeds on the assumption that the war is ended by a general treaty of peace betweenthe United Kingdom and all the Powers with which the United Kingdom is at war. If, on the otherhand, this country were to make a separate treaty of peace with an individual Enemy Power, theend of war with that Power would be the date when the ratifications of the treaty were exchangedor deposited, but that might have little or no effect on the existing Emergency Statutes.4. We think, therefore, that all the phrases used in the Emergency Statutes in reference to thetermination of the war set out in Mr. Justice Atkin&apos;s Report must be understood as having onemeaning, and as having reference to a date fixed in accordance with the principle stated above.They &quot;should authoritatively be declared to bear this interpretation, and we recommend thatParliament should be asked to pass a Bill for the purpose. Such a measure should give statutorypower to enable the Government by Order in Council, or otherwise, to declare authoritatively inaccordance with the principle laid down above the date at which the war shall be deemed to haveended, whether generally or, in the event of a separate peace, as regards individual belligerents.5. We submit this recommendation immediately because we feel, that the adoption of somedefinite principle by which the date of the termination of the war can be determined is necessaryin order to enable us usefully to consider the second part of our terms of reference, viz.: Whatprovision should be made by Parliament for extending in whole or in part or shortening the periodof operation of the several Emergency Statutes and the several regulations made thereunder.6. The First Interim Report of Mr. Justice AtkiiVs Committee considers the application of theprinciple laid down above to the case of contracts. This case is not specifically included in ourterms of reference, and it is enough to say that the statutory declaration of the meaning of thephrase &quot; end of the war&quot; will probably help towards the elucidation (subject in each case to thecontext) of the meaning of similar phrases occurring in contracts.Printed under the authority of His Majesty^ Stationery office..J3y wyman and SONS, limited, fetter lane, london, E.O. 4
