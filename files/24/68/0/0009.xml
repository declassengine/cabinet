l:$/flS/l54S.I 25.10.1918.SUHMARY 0J! BLOCKADE INFORMATIONOctober 18-24,1918.P- 10^WAY.   The German-Norwegian agreement under wljich German safe-conducts will be granted to&quot; Norwegian ships was signed in Ohris-tiania on October 15th.     The Norwegian Government undertake toretain in their present employment during the war the Norwegianvessels at present engaged in the Norwegian coasting trade orchartered to the Norwegian State Commission for Norwegian 3ervi-ces (188,000 tons).   Norwegian vessels not required for Norwegianservices and put into Allied services under the Anglo-NorwegianShipping Agreement may undertake intermediate voyages for Allied, account without forfeiting their claim to immunity from attack atother times.   Goods carried in Norwegian ships sailing underGerman safe-conducts to Norway may not be re-exported to theAllies either in whole or as an integral part of Norwegian marm-factured goods.-  11.11. Government recently notified the NorwegianGovernment that the Associated Governments could not recogniseany agreement with Germany based on an illegal threat to destroyneutral shipping, and the German and Norwegian Governments areboth aware that we reserve the right to deal as circumstances maywarrant with Norwegian vessels sailing under German safe-conducts.2. SWEDEN.     The Chairman of the Swedish Company which exported pyritesto Germany in breach of the American-Swedish Agreement statesthat the Swedish Government informed him that the new agreementprecluded further exports to Germany, but did not revoke thelicences under which he had arranged to fulfil his contract withthe German Government.        There can be no doubt that the SwedishGovernment in allowing these exports sanctioned a deliberate breachof the agreement.     They have not yet replied to the protest ofJjhe Associated Governments or furnished the statistics required.
f* SWITZERLAND.     The United States War Trade Board consider that thenegotiations for a renewal of the American Swiss Agreement shouldtake place at Washington, as Switzerland has for 12 months drawnthe bulk of her supplies from the United States.     The Swiss areunderstood to be willing to send delegates to Washington.   Mr.McCormick suggests that the technical points involved in therenewal of this Agreement aid in the proposals for a further re-striction of Swiss exports to Germany should be exhaustively con-sidered at Paris, Bemo and London, and that a definite programmein regard to all matters which reqaire expert consideration should, be communicated to Washington.4* RUSSIA.      It was reported on October 11th that the Bolshevik Govern-ment had concluded an Economic Agreement with Sweden involving anexchange of goods between the two countries to the value of 13,000,000 Marks for each of the contracting parties.   The Swedish Govern-ment deny official knowledge of the Agreement but some understand-ing appears to have been reached between the Swedish authoritiesand the Russian Trade Delegation recently in Sweden.   The SwedishExport Associations are notoriously in favour of an Agreement underwhich Sweden will obtain flax, hemp,&apos; oils and metals in return foragricultural machinery and tools, chemicals, paper and matches.The chief obstacle to trade between the two countries hitherto hasbeen the determination of the Bolshevik Government to recognise noprivate contracts and to insist that all trade shall be with thsRussian economic Authorities.     The new agreement is said to annulprivate contracts and to provide for a Russian Government controlof the contemplated exchanges.     It also provides that the goodsin question shall be carried in Russian ships.   It is knovn thatat least 12,000 tons of Russian shipping have been definitelychartered for Swedish-Russian trade by agreement with the RussianMaritime Transport Council.The Siberian Government propose to issue Treasury Bills, to
the auftubt of 300,000,000 roubles, in denominations of 5,000, 500and 100 roubles,   There will be a further issue of 150,000,000roubles in small denominations (from 1 to 10 roubles) to replacedamaged or worn-out notes.      The new issues are said to be guran-teed by Treasury Bills and-loan certificates issued by the formerImperial Government to the value of 300,000,000 roubles, and to becovered by a reserve of 1,500 poods of gold in the Omsk State Bai kand the Provincial Treasuries.   All the new bills and notes will be -numbered and signed.\* BUIfiAKIA.     Envoys from the Government of Bulgaria have applied throughH.M. Minister at Athens for a resumption of trade relations withGreat Britain.   They lay particular str ss on the shortage inBulgaria of flour and cotton goods.   They represent that the harvestthis year in South Bulgaria was a complete failure owing to droughtand that the local population are indanger of starvation.   They askthat postal and telegraphic communication may be restored with theAllied countries.   They are now cut off from all communications withthe Central Empires and desire at once to accustom the people ofBulgaria to look to the Allies for their information.   They ask thata civil representative of Great Britain may besent to Sofia throughwhom they may communicate.     H.M. Minister at Athens undertook toforward their representations to London.   He pointed out that freightand supplies are now extremely limited and that the first duty ofthe Allied Governments is naturally towards their, friends.I&apos; BRAZIL.     It has been decided at a Conference of Allied representativesin Washington to hand the Brazilian Government a note urging themto liquidate enemy interests in Brazil without delay and intimating&apos;    that the Allied Governments would assist Brazil in taking over theseinterests and replacing them by Brazilian and Allied Organisations.The Allied Governments would also withdraw the published enemy trad-ing lists for Brazil as soon as the Brazilian Government We&apos; corapli-ed with their recommendations.   Meanwhile the Allied (lo^rnments areconsidering how they may best afford Brazil financial^jassiatance
either by diroot loans or by advances for the purchase of Brazil-ian commodities.      Such assistance can hardly be accorded in(     present circumstance:; as it might tend indirectly to benefitenemy, interests.SSKMAff SUBMARINE BLOCKADE.
