MOBILISATION POLICY,1.11,1.3Admiralty Memorandum for the War CabinetIt is understood that the Secretaryary of State for Warhas submitted a Memorandum to the War Cabinet pointing out thenooessity for legislation to providia for(a) the retention of men with the Colours for a periodbeyond the duration of the War for safeguax^ing andhandling stores, su/pplies and animals, and for tendingthe sick and wounded, otc9 and(b) the reoall of men to the Colours in the event ofremobilisation becoming necessary within a periodof at least two years after the termination cf the War,purposes for a period beyond the duration of the War also applies.be necessary that a considerable proportion of the mineswoepingpersonnel should be retained for the work of clearing the seasof mines which it is estimated will take not more than sismonths to complete6Mine sweeping has beoome a highly specialised service,and much training and long experience have been necessary toattain the efficiency in the personnel which now prevails.   Thowork of clearing tho trade routes and fishing grounds of minesafter tho cessation of hostilities must be regarded as of thoupmost urgency, and it would be highly undosirablo to replacethe present force with untrained or partially trained officersand men.    As the majority of officers and men employed on mine-sweeping duties are enrolled for the duration of the War only,they cannot be retained without legislation.The position of the Navy in regard to these two mattersis as followsRetortion cf Men beyond tho duration of tho War0Tho urgent need for retention of men for certainthough to a less extent, to the Navy0In particular it willv.
Cn tho cessation of hostilities there will &quot;boover 200,000 men due for discharge from the Service, and thereserves of all classes as constituted before the War havepractically ceased to exist6    If all tho men duo to leavsat the termination of the War are discharged without furtherliability for service in the Navy if roquiredv wo should notbe in a position to remobiliso in emergency during demobilisationor to enrol sufficient reserves subsequently, as we shouldhave lost touch with tho highly trained personnel producedby the War0It is therefore necessary that legislation shouldbe obtained wbioh would enable the present personnel of theNavy who are duo for discharge at the termination of tho Warto be made liable to reoall in the event of romobilisationduring a further period of, say, two years, by wbioh timethe post-war Naval policy and plans may be expected to becompleted^Tho Admiralty therefore desires that the legislationwhich is proposed for the Army in the Memorandum by thoSecretary of State for War before referred to, should applyalso to the Navya(Sgd.)
