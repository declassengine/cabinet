Sir,

I am desired by the Executive Committee of the Navy League to transmit to you the following resolutions which were unanimously carried at their Meeting held to-day :-

That the Navy League makes a definite and emphatic demand for a declaration on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Government, that before any proposal for peace with Germany is entertained, there must be a guaranteed undertaking on Germany&apos;s part to make compensation for the losses sustained by British and Allied Merchant Shipping through submarine attack, on the basis of ship for ship and ton for ton in equitable proportion. Any deficiency to be supplied by raw materials for ship construction. Such compensation be made apart from the legitimate claims of owners for loss of cargoes, earning power of ships, and reparation for the lives of passengers and crews.

That before any armistice be granted, all enemy submarines, together with all other ships of war and all enemy wireless stations, be handed over to the Allied Powers.

I have, &amp;c.

(Signed) V. Biscoe Tritton,

Joint Chairman.

The Right Honourable

A.J. Balfour, O.M. LL.D., M.P.,
