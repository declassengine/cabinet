Til if-&apos;,Mnenf (s the Property of&apos; &quot;V &quot;&quot;&apos;&apos;v ijosl -,Jn GovernmentHisCirculated by the Secretary of State for India.103SECRET.Conditions of Armistice with Turkey.On Tuesday evening, 22nd October, I received from the Foreign Office a copyof a telegram dated 22nd October to the Ambassadors in Paris, Rome and Washington,informing them of instructions given to-our Admiral with regard to armisticeovertures from Turkey. This is the only official information which has been givento me but I am given to understand : (1) That on Monday the Cabinet learned that General Townshencl had approachedthe British Admiral with a view to an armistice and peace, and makingsuggestions as to peace terms.(2) That the Admiral had been told on Monday that peace could not be madewith the Turks except by us in concert with our Allies, and that he wouldget instructions the next day as to an armistice.(3) That on Monday the War Office and the Admiralty were instructed by theCabinet to re-arrange in order of importance the terms of armisticeagreed at Versailles.I hope the Cabinet will forgive me for submitting that I cannot fully dischargemy responsibilities to the Government of India or to the Cabinet if I am not allowedthe necessary information without which it is impossible for me to submit to themviews and opinions vital to the Indian Empire.When Indian representatives were invited to join the Imperial War Cabinet andwhen it was stated in public that the Imperial War Cabinet was to he kept in beingthroughout, the year, it was assumed by India that either through the Secretary ofState or through the representatives chosen by the Viceroy she would be consultedand her interests safeguarded in grave matters such as the conclusion of hostilitieswith belligerent countries. And this assurance was repeated specifically in themessage which the Prime Minister gave to Sir Satyendra Sinha to convey to theViceroy.There is, however, a considerable difference between general peace and warnegotiations and discussions with all our enemies, and peace and Avar negotiations anddiscussions with Turkey in particular. Although I submit that the.terms of Jndia&apos;srepresentation on the Imperial War Cabinet make it right that I should be in a positionto communicate to the Viceroy intelligence comparable to the intelligence communicatedto the Dominions, when it comes to relations with Turkey, India&apos;s interest is indis-putable and not to be neglected. The Cabinet cannot, I think, dispense withinformation as to the Indian point of view on this subject. The Indian Avar effort isat present concentrated wholly against the Turkish enemy, troops recruited andmaintained by India have under the leadership of General Allenby and GeneralMarshall brought about the possibility of peace with Turkey, and apart from therelationship between Turkey, Persia, Afghanistan and large sections of the populationof India, who have a common creed, the possibility of peace with Turkey must-1necessarily affect the preparations which the government of India have to make forthe future.   These considerations are of the highest importance.Now I would suggest to the Cabinet the following considerations which lead&quot;me to hope that despite the instructions sent to the Admiral there Avill be anopportunity of reviewing the AArhole situation again.(1) As&quot; my colleagues are aware, Avar between Turkey and Great Britain placedthe Mohammedans of India in a very serious and difficult position. They had toharmonise the Mohammedan principle of obedience to any temporal power with theMohammedan tenet of religious devotion to their Khalif, the Sultan ol; Turkey. ButI do not think that anyone Avho is competent to express an opinion would doubt that,having been unfortunately involved in war with Turkey, our only safe course, evenfrom the Indian point of view, was&quot; to beat the Turk. lean conceive nothing moreunfortunate from the Eastern point of view than if Ave demanded of Germany termsalmost amounting to unconditional surrender, if we demanded of Bulgaria uncon-10  SS 9  50   10/18
ditional surrender, if we succeeded in enforcing such terms upon Austria as tonecessitate the breaking up of that Empire, but had a compromise peace with Turkey. 0In these circumstances the one Power that was not at the complete mercy of tho Allieswould be an Asiatic Power, the influence of which ramifies almost throughout thewhole of Northern Asia.(2) 1 hope further that the message to the Admiral does not mean that the Alliescontemplate a peace Avith Turkey which would involve a separate consideration of thore-arrangement of territory from the general re-arrangement of the woiid&apos;s territorieswhich must result from the Peace Conference. That would in my opinion be amistake similar to the mistake matlo by Germany at Brest- Litovsk. If Turkishproblems are not viewed in the light of German, Austrian and Bulgarian problems,our Allies&apos; appetites are likely to he more uncontrollable, and Ave may find that wehave prejudiced our position vis-a-vis America, or what is worse, that for fear ofprejudicing our position vis-d-vis America, Ave have to yield so much to the Turks asto infringe irreparably the principle which I have suggested above of no compromisepeace with the Turks.(3) I think I have heard at Cabinet meetings the principle enunciated that innegotiating an armistice the victorious side ought to insist upon such terms as wiltensure that it will never have to resume hostilities in order to get what it wants, thatit will be the beaten side which will have to fight again if it objects to the positionwhich obtains as a result of the armistice.Now if Turkey makes an armistice on the conditions which the War Cabinet haslaid down as vital, it will still apparently be in occupation of Aleppo. Am I wrong-in saying that Aleppo has been definitely promised to the Arabs and that we shall notbe able to fulfil that promise unless the Turks allow us to occupy it? Am I wrongin assuming that if Turkey accepts the armistice on the conditions Avhich the Cabinethas specified as vital, she will be left in occupation of Mosul, and am I wrong inthinking that Mosul was to have been rescued from Turkish rule ? It will be saidthat such will be the Allied position at Constantinople that all these things can beinsisted upon afterwards. That is no doubt true, hut I Avould remind the Cabinet ofthe effect on our relations with King Hussein when it isknoAvnthat Ave agreed to ceasefighting the Turks without having ensured from them positions Avhich avouIc! enableus to keep our promise to the Arabs, and the effect upon India and the Mohammedanworld generally of leaving such matters as these to negotiations.It will also be said that there is still a possibility that the Admiral will obtain allthe points agreed upon at Versailles. I am informed, however, that the instructionsgiven to our Admiral must inevitably entail obtaining much less.Surely every principle of negotiation with an Eastern people is infringed if weinstruct our plenipotentiary to demand certain things but, if he cannot get them, tomodify his demands. The first principle of negotiation with Easterns is to make yourdemands and stick to them. The very fact that we are asking for things that theTurks will not give and then dropping our demands will produce a very serious effectAvheu the Turks spread it abroad. That means victory for the Turk on all the pointsAvhich the Turks do not accept, and really, although I attach great importance to theVersailles terms, I would infinitely have preferred that the Cabinet should havethrown them over straight away and given the Admiral definite instructions to whichat all costs he Avas to slick. As a result you may even get a warm welcome in Turkey,illuminations, enthusiastic welcomes in Constantinople, to such an extent that thehearts of the War Cabinet will soften, the enthusiasm of the wily Turk will pleasethem, the victims of German dragooning will have been rescued by the noble-senti-mented Allies, Turkey will have learned wisdom, and all the terms Avhich you couldimpose as the result of your position at Constantinople will not in fact be imposed ;suzerainties, protectorates under Turkish sway will once more be granted to thoseAvho have welcomed us and the Turks will by no means have been beaten or humiliated.Our relations with Mohammedans, Avith Arabs, with Indians, will be gravelyimperilled if the Turkish flag remains flying in the Iraq and Turkey has not beenbeaten.. Even if I am too late I have still one suggestion to make in the hope that evenyet there may be some opportunity of revision.Is the Cabinet aware that the Turks at the present moment are in occupation ofBritish territory ? That tbey have seized and seized successfully, territory belongingto the Sultan of Lahej, which we have been unable to rescue by force of arms ? Isthe Cabinet aAvare that the Sultan of Lahej, homeless, is now our guest at Aden,,despite the fact that we were pledged by treaty to maintain him in his territories ?
It has always been agreed by those who have discussed Eastern affairs that it waseminently desirable to turn the Turk out by firms rather than let him go in peace.We have never found the men, material or opportunity to do it as yet. But surelythe immediate disappearance of Turks from British territory ought to have been oneof the prime conditions of an armistice, and surely if it had been included in theinstructions to the Admiral, or if it could now be included, it would not have been athing which would be likely to be an obstacle to the conclusion of the armistice. Icannot over-rate the effect upon our prestige throughout Southern Arabia of the factthat we had agreed with the Turks to lay down our arms whilst they were stillvictorious&quot; or undefeated and in occupation of lands for which we were responsible,and that they only withdrew as a result of subsequent negotiations.This seems to me to be more important than any of the other considerations 1have mentioned. But I submit it and everything else to the Cabinet, for I recognisethat these considerations have to be brought by.them into relationship with all theother factors of the war situation. It is ray duty to lay them before the Cabinet, andthis is the first opportunity I have had to do so.E. S. M.24th October 1918.
