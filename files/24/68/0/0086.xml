ris&quot;Document is the Property .of His Britannic M^eatyb Government.]SECRET. Political Intelligence Department,Foreign Office.Special 3.MEMORANDUMonBRITISH COMMITMENTS TO KING HUSE1N.OUR commitraents to King Husein are not embodied in any agreement or treatysigned, or even acknowledged, by both parties. In this way they differ from those toRussia, France, Italy, and certain independent Arab rulers such as the Idrisi andbin Saud. They can only be analysed by summarising the history of our dealings withthe King during the war, under different heads. And the position is complicated bythe King&apos;s habit of ignoring or refusing to take note of conditions laid down by us towhich he objects, and then carrying on as if the particular question had been settledbetween us according to his own desires.The references in the following summary, where not to Foreign Office papers, areto the historical narrative compiled by the Arab Bureau at Cairo and dated the29th November, 1916. The pagination referred to is that of the Foreign Office copy(filed in the Library under &quot; Confidential: Turkey: Arab Bureau: 1914 seqq.(No. 112)&quot;).(i.) General Guarantees against the Restoration of the status quo.His Majesty&apos;s Government^ representatives in Egypt had been in touch withSherif Husein and his sons especially Abdullah before the war.On the 24th September 1914 (in the interval during which Great Britain was atwar with Germany but not yet with Turkey) the Foreign Office telegraphed at LordKitchener&apos;s request to Cairo, instructing that a special messenger should be sent toAbdullah to enquire what would be the Sherif&apos;s attitude in the event of war withTurkey breaking out (p. 21a). Abdullah sent a written answer expressing hispreference for Great Britain over Turkey, &quot; So long as she protects the rights of our country and the rights of the personof His Highness our present Emir and Lcrd and the rights of his Emirate and itsindependence in all respects, without any exceptions or restrictions, and so long asit supports us against any foreign aggression and in particular against the Ottomans,especially if they wish to set up any one else as Emir with the intention of causinginternal dissension their principle of government-and provided that the Govern-ment of Great Britain would guarantee these fundamental principles clearly andin writing.   This guarantee we expect to receive at the first opportunity &quot; (p. 23).This request was met in a Foreign Office telegram of the 3lstjQ.ctober 1914 (thedate on which war between Great Britain and Turkey was declared) : &quot; Lord Kitchener&apos;s salaams to Shc-rif Abdullah.....If the Arab nationassist England in this war that lias been forced upon us by Turkey, England willguarantee that no internal intervention takes place in Arabia, and wilt give Arabsevery assistance against external aggression.&quot; It may be that an Arab of true race will assume the Khalifate at Mecca orMedina and so good may come by the help of God out of all the evil that is nowoccurring&quot; (p. 24).This statement was tran3mitted to Abdullah by letter from Cairo with the followingaddition:  &apos;&quot; If the Emir of Mecca is willing to assist Great Britain in this conflict, GreatBritain is willing, recognising and respecting the sacred and unique office of theEmir Husein (titles), to guarantee the independence, rights and privileges of theSherifiate against all external foreign aggression, in particular that of the Ottomans.Till now we have defended Islam in the person of the Turks; henceforward it shallbe in that of the noble Arabs &quot; (p. 24).[883] B
2In the letter which Sherif Husein sent to Sir H. McMahon in July, 1915, definitelyproposing an agreement with His Majesty&apos;s Goverment, he laid down the followingcondition : &quot; Thirdly, for the security of this Arab independence and the certainty of suchpreference of economic enterprises, both high contracting parties to offer mutualassistance to the best ability of their military and naval forces, to face any foreignPower which may attack either party. Peace not to be decided without agreementof both parties &quot; (p. 40).This condition was more emphatically stated in the Sherifs third letter toSir H. McMahon, dated the 5 th November 1915 :-&quot; (5) When the Arab knows that the Government of Great Britain is theirAlly who will not leave thern to themselves at the conclusion of peace, in the faceof Germany and Turkey, and that she will support and effectively defend them,then to enter the war at once will be, no doubt, in conformity with the generalinterest of the Arabs&quot; (p. 94).. In reply to this, Sir H McMahon, acting on Foreign Office instructions, gave thefollowing assurance in his third letter to the Sherif, dated the 13th December, 1915 : &quot; It is most essential that you should spare no effort to attach all the Arabpeoples to our united cause, and urge them to afford no assistance to our enemies.&quot; It is on the success of these efforts, and on the more active measures whichthe Arabs may hereafter take in support of our cause, when the time for actioncomes, that the permanence and strength of our agreement must depend.&quot; Under these circumstances, I am further directed by the Government ofGreat Britain to inform you that you may rest assured that Great Britain has nointention cf concluding any peace, in terms of which the freedom of the Arabpeoples from German and Turkish domination does not form an essentialcondition &quot; (p. 103).The Sherif took note of this assurance in his fourth letter to Sir H. McMahon,dated the 1st January, 1916&apos;: &quot; I have a strong belief, which the living will inherit from the dead, in thedeclarations which you gave in the conclusion of your honoured letter&quot; (p. 115).The assurance was of course contingent, but the Sherifs action since that date hasevidently brought it into operation.It was repeated in a Foreign Office message telegraphed to Sir E. Wingate, onthe 4th February, 1918, for transmission to the Sherif (now King of the Hejazj : &quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government, along with their Allies, stand for the cause ofthe liberation of the oppressed nations, and are determined to stand by the Arabpeoples in their struggle for the reconstruction of an Arab world, in which lawshall once again replace Ottoman violence and unity the artificial rivalriespromoted by Turkish officials, Flis Majesty&apos;s Government re-affirm their formerpledges to His Highness in regard to the freeing of the Arab peoples. Liberationis the policy His Majesty&apos;s Government have pursued and intend to pursue withunswerving determination by protecting such Arabs as are already liberated fromthe danger of re-conquest, and assisting such Arabs as are still under the yoke ofthe oppressor to obtain their freedom^&apos; 1Relation of Commitments under (i) to British desiderata: No conflict, if interpreted in the light of our reservations under (iii), (iv) and (v).(ii.)   Guarantees regarding the Moslem Holy Places.The Government of India issued the following proclamation on the 2nd November,1914:- n &apos;&quot; In view of the outbreak of war between Gr. at Britain and Turkey, which tothe regret of Great Britain has been brought about by the ill-advised, unprovoked,and deliberate action of the Ottoman Government, his Excellency the Viceroy isauthorised by His Majesty&apos;s Government to make the following public announce-1 22108/140/18.
merit in regard to the Holy Places of Arabia, including the Holy Shrines ofMesopotamia and the Port of Jeddah, in order thaTtEere may be no niisunder-standing on the part of His Majesty&apos;s most loyal Moslem subjects as to the attitudeof His Majestys Government in this war, in which no question of a religiouscharacter is involved. These Holy Places and Jeddah will- be immune from attackor molestation by British naval and military ibrcespso long as there is no inter-ference with pilgrims from India to the Holy Places and Shrines in question. Atthe request of His Majesty&apos;s Government, the Governments of France and Russiahave given similar assurances &quot; (p. 2).A much looser pledge, extending to the whole of Arabia, was given in a ForeignOffice telegram of the 14th November, 1914, to the High Commissioner, Cairo: &quot; His Majestys Government have no intention of undertaking any militaryor naval operations in Arabia, or against its ports, unless such a course becomesnecessary for the protection of Arabian interests against Turkish or otheraggression, or in support of any attempt by the Arabs to free themselves fromTurkish rule.&quot;On the 14th April, 1915, the Foreign Office (acting on the strength of a letteraddressed by Seyyid Sir Ali Morghani, Grand Kadi of the Sudan, to Sir R Wingate then Sirdar and forwarded by him) telegraphed to the High Commissioner, Cairo :-&quot;You should inform Sir R. &quot;Winyate that he is authorised bv me to let it beknown, should he think it desirable, that His Majesty&apos;s Government will make it anessential condition in the terms of peace that the Arabian Peninsula and itsMohammedan Holy Plaees should remain in the hands of an independentSovereign State&quot; (p. 30).This was communicated to Sir Ali Morghani, and by him, apparently, toSherif Husein. Later, towards the end of June, the substance of it was embodiedin proclamations distributed in Egypt, the Sudan, and Arabia.In October, when the negotiations with the Sherif were well advanced, Faroki(a member of one of the Arab Nationalist organisations in the Ottoman army, whohad passed over to the British lines at Gallipoli and had been brought to Egypt inOctober) suibnijrted^siiggestions to the High Commissioner for assurances to the Sherif,one of them bdng that &quot; England will guarantee the Holy Places against externalaggression and recognise their inviolability&quot; (p. 51). Sir H, McMahon communicatedthis in a private telegram to Sir II. Grey on the 18th October, 1915. Instructions weresent him in a Foreign Office telegram of the 20th October, 1915, and embodied fry himin his second letter, dated the 24th October, 1915, to Sherif Husein. In this letterFarokfs suggested assurance regarding the Holy Places was conveyed verbatim.Finally, the following declaration was made in an official communique publishedon the 29th July, I91(i, in Egypt, after the Sherifs revolt, with the authorisation ofthe Foreign Office : &quot; It remains the fixed policy of Great Britain to abstain from all interferencein religious matters and to spare no effort to secure Holy Places of Islam from allexternal aggression.&quot; It is an unalterable point of British policy that those Holy Places shouldremain under independent Moslem rule and authority.&quot; The present state of war places many difficulties and dangers in the way ofthose wishing to perform the pilgrimage, but the action taken by the Sherif ofMecca gives rise to hopes that arrangements may be made whereby the pilgrimsmay in the coming year visit the Holy Shrines in peace and security&quot; (p. 57,Part 11).Relation of Commitments under (ii) to British desiderata : No conflict.. (iii.) Boundaries of Arab Independence.In the Foreign Office telegram of the 14th April, 1915 (No. 173), to theHigh Commissioner, Cairo (quoted in section (ii) above), His Majesty&apos;s Governmentcommitted themselves to a public declaration that &quot; they will make it an essentialcondition in the terms of peace that the Arabian Peninsula should remain in the hands
4of an independent Sovereign State.&quot;   They added, however, that &quot; it is not possible todefine at this stage exactly how much territory should be included in this State.&quot;That question was raised in July 1915 by Sherif Husein in his first letter toSir H. McMahon, the first of the conditions on which he proposed co-operation withGreat Britain against the Turks being as follows : &quot; England to acknowledge the independence of the Arab countries, boundedon the north by Mersina and Adana up to 370 of latitude, on which degree fallsBirijik, Urfa, Mardin, Midiat, Amadia Island,3 up to the border of Persia; on theeast, by the borders of Persia up to the Gulf of Basrah; on the south, by theIndian Ocean, with the exception of the position of Aden to remain as it is; onthe west, by the Bed Sea, the Mediterranean Sea up to Mersina,&quot; (p. 40).It appears from a statement made by Faroki (for whom see section (ii) above)that Lord Kitchener&apos;s assurance of the 31st October, 1914, to Sherif Abdullah (seesection (i)) had been discussed between Sherif Husein and the Central ArabNationalist Committee, which was at that time in being at Damascus, and that thisterritorial demand was suggested to the Sherif by the Committee.3 Emissaries weresent from Damascus to Jeddah with instructions to bargain about this demand Indetail, but to insist on a general acceptance of it by Great Britain as a condition ofcontinuing negotiations.On the 30th August, 1915, Sir H. McMahon, in his first letter to Sherif Husein,gave a non-committal answer on this point, re-affirming Lord Kitcheners pledges, butalluding to the discussion of boundaries as &quot;premature&quot; (p. 43).On the 9th September, 1915, however, the Sherif, in his second letter, pressed fordefinition: &quot; Your Excellency will pardon me and permit me to say clearly that thecoolness and hesitation displayed in the question of the limits and boundaries,by saying that the discussion of these at present is of no use and loss of time, andthat they are still in the hands of the Government which is ruling them, etc.,might be taken to infer an estrangement or something of the sort.&quot; As the limits and boundaries demanded are not those of one person whom weshould satisfy, and with whom we should discuss them after the war is over,but our peoples have seen that the life of their new proposal is bound at least.bythese limits and their word is united on this;&quot; Therefore they have found it necessary to discuss this point first with thePower in whom they now have their confidence and trust as a final appeal,viz., the illustrious British Empire&quot; (p. 44).The substance of this letter was conveyed to the Foreign Office by Sir H, McMahonon the 18th October, 1915 (telegram No. 623&apos;, and in a private telegram of the samedate to Sir E. Grey1, (p 49) he reported the results of further conversations withFaroki. Faroki declared that Germany had promised the Arab party the fulHlment ofall their demands, and that they were at the parting of the ways. He expressed theopinion that:-       ^ hiUvW $v$A     &quot;        Chj-f-^ s^k X f&apos;W - l^M^&quot; The occupation by France of purely Arab districts of Aleppo, Hama, Hornsand Damascus would be opposed by Arabs with force of arms, but with thisexception .... they would accept some modification of the North-westernboundaries proposed by the Sherif of Mecca &quot; (p. 51).This latter suggestion r^^rjaroki is important; for though it does not appear/certain that it^ would have been agreed to Ivy the rest of the Damascus party, and\s, it has certainly never been agreed to hv^Sherif. Husein, it was taken by His Majosty&apos;s\S Government as the basis of their negotiations with/France, and is the origin of thedivision between the Blue Area and Area A.        VIt was embodied on the 24th October, 1915, in Sir H. McMahons second letter tothe Sherif:  &quot; The districts of Mersina and Alexandretta, and portions of Syria lying to thewest of the districts of Damascus. Horns, Hama and Aleppo cannot be saidto be purely Arab, and should be excluded from the proposed limits and \boundaries. With the above modifications, and without prejudice to ourexisting treaties with Arab Chiefs, we accept these limits and boundarirs ; and inregard to those portions of the territories therein in which Great Britain is free toact without detriment to the interests of her Ally, France, I am empowered in the2 ? &quot; inland &quot; or else &quot; Jezireh, Amadia.&quot;     3 157740/15 : statement by Paroki, pp. 4 and 10.     4 153045/15.3
5326name of the Government of Great Britain to give the following assurances, andmake the following reply to your letter: &quot;&apos; Subject to the above modifications. Great Britain is prepared to recogniseand support the independence of the Arabs within the territories included in thelimits and boundaries proposed by the Sherif of Mecca &apos; &quot; (p. 53).It will be noted that the reservation in favour of French interests, even within thenarrower boundaries of Arab independence here proposed, prepared the groundfor the establishment of Area A.On the 5th November, in his third letter, -the Sherif agreed to the exclusionof Mersina and Adana, but formally reiterated his claim to the rest: 5&quot; In order to facilitate an agreement and to rentier a service to Islam, and atthe same time to avoid all that may cause Islam troubles and hardships seeingmoreover that we have great consideration for the distinguished qualities anddispositions of the Government of Great Britain we renounce our insistenceon the inclusion of the vilayets of Mersina and Adana in the Arab Kingdom. Butthe provinces of Aleppo and Beirout, and their sea-coasts, are purely Arabprovinces, and there is no difference between a Moslem and a Christian Arab : theyare both descendents of one forefather &quot; (p. 92).It may be remarked that he does not mention either the vilayet of Lebanon or thesanjak of Jerusalem territories which were both excluded from the independent Arab     /State in the subsequent Anglo-French Agreement.   But he has expressly claimedLebanon on other occasions since then, and his reference to the Christian Arabshere implies its inclusion.The policy laid down with regard to the Christians was evidently inspired by theDamascus Committee, for Faroki. in his conversations at Cairo, stated their views onthe point thus: &quot; The basis of the new Arab Empire will be national, not religious. It will bean Arab, not a Moslem Empire. Christian Arabs, Druses, and Nosairia will havethe same rights as Moslems, but the Jews will be governed by a special law.&quot; 0The Sherifs renunciation of Mersina and Adana and guarantees to the ChristianArabs were taken note of by Sir H. McMahou in his third letter of the 13th December,1915.   His reiterated claim to Aleppo and Beirout vilayets was ignored (p. 102).On the 1st January, 1916, in his fourth letter to Sir H. McMahon, the Sherifanswered by declaring that he would not press his claims against France till after thewar, but announcing his intention of then doing so : &quot; As regards the northern parts and their coasts, we have already stated inour previous letter what were &quot;the utmost possible modifications ; and all this wasdone only so as to fulfil those aspirations whose attainment is desired by the will ofthe Blessed and Supreme God. It is this same feeling and desire which impelledus to avoid what may possibly injure the alliance of Great Britain and France andthe agreement made between them during the present wars and calamities ; yetwe find it our duty that the eminent Minister should be sure that, at the firstopportunity after this war is finished, we shall ask you (what we avert our eyesfrom to-day) for what we now leave to France in Beirout and its coasts ....(P; 114. .&quot; It is impossible to allow any derogation that gives France or any other Powera span of land in those regions&quot; (p. 113).Sir H. McMahon answered this in his fourth letter of the 30th January 1916, by takingnote of the Sherifs &quot; desire to avoid anything which might possibly injure the allianceof Great Britain arid France,&quot; and warning him that the friendship between the twocountries would endure after the war (Part II, p. 5). The Sherif, on his part, neverreferred to the boundary question again during the negotiations, but there is evidenceto show that the claims not accepted by His Majesty&apos;s Government have not beenwithdrawn by him./    5 This formula (and not the Dainascus-Homs-Hama-Aleppo line) was proposed to Sir Mark Sykes by 0^Faroki about the beginning of November (p. 104).   Faroki and the Sherif were in communication through .sthe Sherifs messenger to Cairo. 6 157740/15 : 1&apos;aroki&apos;s statement, p. 10.[883] C
For instance, a letter written to him by his son Sheril All on the 26th May, 1916,on the eve of the revolt, and mostly occupied with military details, concludes : &quot; Our Lord will not, we hope, forget Alexandretta, Beirout, and thoseregions &quot; (Part II, p. 41).Again, Sherif Abdullah remarked to Colonel Wilson at Jeddah on the 1st November,1916,7 d propos of his fathers assumption of the title of &quot; King of the Arabs,&quot; that&quot; the boundaries of his kingdom were settled previous to the revolt&quot; a misstatementof the facts, unless it was intended, a,s it certainly was not, as an acceptance of theboundaries His Majesty&apos;s Government had consented to.On the 29th July, 191.7, King Husein expressed his views on the boundaryquestion to Captain Lawrence :  8&quot; The main points were that he had altogether refused to permit any Frenchannexation of Beirout and the Lebanon,   &apos; They are Arab countries, but 1 will/neither take them myself nor permit anyone else to take them.   They havev deserved independence and it is my duty to see they get it.&apos;&quot; He said that he refused a detailed discussion of boundaries on the groundsthat hostilities between Turkey and the Allies still continue and all decisions takennow would necessarily have to be modified in accordance with the actual results ofmilitary operations, for which he must have an absolutely free hand. &apos; Ifadvisable we will pursue the Turks to Constantinople and Erzerum, so why talkabout Beirout, Aleppo, and Hail.&apos; &quot;He revealed the same state of mind in conversations with Colonel Wilson a fewmonths later.yFrom conversations with him during the second week of January, 1918, CommanderHogarth gathered that he still expected France and Great Britain to fall out, andcalculated that he would be able to force the hand of the French with our backing.10On the 11th February, 1918, Colonel Basset wrote to Sir li. Wingate that &apos;&apos;KingHusein had read into the terms.of His MnjestVs Governments &apos; pledge&apos; very wideterritorial boundaries, and professes the most implicit trust in the intention and abilityof Great Britain to redeem the &apos; pledge &apos; as he reads it.&quot; 11Relation of Commitments under (iii) to British Desiderata.The boundaries of Arab independence to which His Majesty&apos;s Government arecommitted by Sir H. McMahons second letter to Sherif Husein (24th October, 1915),exclude (a) the British territory and Protectorate of Aden ; and presumably also (6) theBritish Protectorate of Bahrein, since the Sherif s claims take the &quot; Indian Ocean &quot; asthe boundary of the Arabian Peninsula, and make no mention of islands (see first letterof July 1915, quoted above).On the other baud, they include (e) Akka-Haifa and (d) Basra, though, in theagreement of the 6th May, 1916, with France, and in correspondence which has passedat various times between the Foreign Office and the India Office, it seems to be assumedthat both these places will become British enclaves in the independent Arab ami,attached in some formal way (whether by annexation, protectorate, or lease) to theBritish Empire.Sir Mark Sjkgs reported that, in his conversations with Faroki early in November1915, the latter stated that &quot; the Arabs would agree to Basra town and all cultivatedlands to the south being British territory.&quot; 12 But there is no other record of such aconcession on his part or on the part of any other representative of the Arab nationalistorganisations in Turkey. And King Husein has never mentioned the possibility of this,nor have His Majesty&apos;s Government mentioned it in their correspondence with him.13Again, the right of transporting British troops, in peace or war, along a British-owned, railway from Akka Haifa to Irak and the Persian Gulf has otdy been agreed toby France, Italy, and Russia, but&quot; has never been either demanded or consented to in/any negotiations between His Majesty&apos;s Government and tbe Arabs themselves.In these cases, then, the relation between British commitments and desiderataremains unsettled.As regards the nature of the Arab independence to which His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment have committed themselves witntn the boundaries specified in Sir H. MoMahonsletter of the 24th Ocober, 1915, that is limited by reservations under (iv.)

Existing British Treaties and Agreements with Arab^   Governments in the independent area.   The relation of British commitments to deside-k    rata under these heads will be discussed below.(iv.) Foreign Administration in Irak, Syria and Palestine. y.Tn his private telegram of the 18th October, 1915. to- Sir E. Grey, Sir H.McMahon reported that &quot; with regard to Basra vilayet Faroid accepts the fact that       vjy^M vspecial measures of British control will be necessary, in view of Great Britain s interest      - l , \there&quot; (p. 51).In their instructions telegraphed to Sir H.- McMahon on the 20th October, 1915,the Foreign Office replied on this point: &quot; Mesopotamia. In view of the special interests in the Bagdad Province andarea actually in our occupation, the proposed sphere of British control, namely,the Basrah vilayet, will need extension. This will not, of course, prejudice ourinterests with Arab Chiefs&quot; (p. 62). ,This was embodied on the 24th October, 1915, in Sir H. McMahon&apos;s second letterto the Sherif: &apos;&quot; With regard to the vilayets of Bagdad and Basrah, the Arabs will recognisethat the established position and interests of Great Britain necessitate specialmeasures of administrative control in order to secure these territories from foreignaggression, to promote the welfare of the local population and to safeguard ourmutual economic interests&quot; (p. 54).The Sherif took up the question on the 5th November, 1915, in his third letter toto Sir H. McMahon :-&quot; As the provinces of Irak a-e parts of the pure Arab Kingdom, and were, infact, the seat vf its government in the time of Ali, and in the time of all theKhali s who succeeded him; and as in them began the civilisation of the Arabs,and as their towns in those provinces were the first towns built in Islam, wherethe Arab power became so great; therefore these provinces are greatly valued byall Arabs, far and near, and their traditions cannot be forgotten by them.Consequently we cannot satisfy the Arab Nation or make them give up such atitle to nobility. But in order to render an accord easy, and taking intoconsideration the assurances mentioned in the fifth article of your letter, to keepand guard our mutual interests in that country as they are one and the same, forall these reasons we might agree to leave under the British administration for ashort time those districts that are now occupied by British troops, without therights of either side being prejudiced thereby (especially those of the Arab Nation,which interests are economic and vital to it), and against a sum paid as compen-sation to the Arab Kingdom for the period of the occupation, in order to meet theexpense which every new Kingdom is bound to support; at the same timerespecting your agreements with the Sheikhs of those districts, and especiallythose winch are essential&quot; (p. 92).About the same date, in his conversations with Sir Mark Sykes, Faroki discussedthe whole question of British priority of economic enterprise and administrativeassistance in Mesopotamia, and of a similar position in Syria for France : &quot; The Arabs would agree to a convention with Fiance to allow her a monopolyof all concessionary enterprise in Palestine and Syria: the latter being defined asbounded as far south as Deir Zor by &quot;the Euphrates, thence to Deraa and to Maanalong the Hejaz Railway.&quot; As far South as Maan the Hejaz Railway could be sold to Frenchconcessionnaires, Arabs further agreeing to employ in this area European employesand none but French as advisers. To be noted that Arabs only undertake to* employ Europeans if they need them, but Faroki points out that the object of thisstipulation is to avoid any appearance of control over them (Arabs). In this areathe Arabs would agree to accoid special recognition to all French educationalestablishments.&quot;As regards the remainder of the Greater Arabia (Irak and Jezireh andNorthern Mesopotamia) the Arabs would agree to an identical convention withGreat Britain&quot; (j). 104).
8On the 13th December, 1915, in his third letter to the Sherif, Sir H. McMahonreserved the details of Great Britain&apos;s position in Bagdad vilayet for future con-sideration: &quot;The Government of Great Britain, as I have already informed you, areready to give ail guarantees of assistance and support within their power to theArab Kingdom, but their interests demand, as you yourself have recognised, afriendly and stable administration in the vilayet of Bagdad, and the adequatesafeguarding of these interests calls for a much fuller and more detailed con-sideration than the present situation and urgency of these negotiations permits &quot;(p. 103).On the 1st of January, 1916, in his fourth letter to Sir H. McMahon, the Sherifomitted further discussion of the conditions of British administration, and left thefixing of the financial compensation (which he had proposed, but to which His Majesty&apos;sGovernment h d not committed themselves) to His Majesty&apos;s Governments discretion: &quot; With regard to what had been stated in your honoured communicationconcerning al-Ira,k, as to the matter of compensation for the period of occupation,we, in order to strengthen the confidence of Great Britain in our attitude and inour words and actions, really and veritably, and in order to give her evidence ofour certainty and assurance in trusting her glorious Government, leave thedetermination of the amount to the perception of her wisdom and justice &quot; (p. 112).On the 30th January, 1916, Sir H. McMahon took note of this in his fourth letterto the Sherif, and promised to &quot;take the question into careful consideration when theenemy has been defeated and the time for peaceful settlement arrives&quot; (p. 5, Part II).On the 19th May, 1917, in conversation with Sir Mark Sykes and M. Picot,14&apos; KingHusein &quot; admitted the necessity for European advisers to heads of departments, andreferred to Syria and Irak,&quot; but heobjected to thlTsuggestion that these advisers musthave executive authority. In an interview on the following day, a declaration by theKing, in answer to a message from the French Government which had been delivered,to him by M. Picot, was read aloud to the following effect :  &quot;That His Majesty the King of Hejaz learned with satisfaction that theFrench Government approved of Arab national aspirations; and that, as he hadconfidence in Great Britain, he would be content if the French Government pursuedthe same policy towards Arab aspirations on the Moslem Syrian Littoral as theBritish did in Bagdad.&quot;On the same occasion Sherif Faisal delivered the following message from his fatherto Sir Mark Sykes :-&quot;We are ready to co-operate with France in Syria to the fullest extent andwith England in Mesopotamia.....&quot;15King Hnsein&apos;s view of the results of these two interviews is given in a report byCaptain Lawrence of an illuminating conversation with him on the 29th July, 1917 :-- 16&quot;The King is extremely pleased to have trapped M. Picot into the admissionthat France will be satisfied in Syria with the position that Great Britain desires inIraq. That, he says, means a temporary occupation of the country for strategicaland political reasons (with probably an annual grant to the Sherif in compensationand recognition), and concessions in the way of public works. &apos;I was readywithout being asked to guard their interests in the existing railways, and assisttheir schools; but the Hejaz and Syria are like the palm and lingers of one hand,and I could not have consented to the amputation of any finger or part of a fingerwithout leaving myself a cripple.&apos;&quot; In conclusion, the Sherif remarked on the shortness and informality ofconversations, the absence of written documents, and the fact that the only changein the situation caused by the meeting was the French renunciation of the ideas ofannexation, permanent occupation or suzerainty of any part of Syria-&apos; but this wedid not embody in a formal treaty, as the war is not finished. I merely ruad outmy acceptance of the formula as the British in Iraq, proposed to me by M.

9With regard to Palestine, His Majesty&apos;s Government are committed by Sir II.McMahoifs letter to the Sherif on the 24th October, 1915, to its inclusion in the boundariesof Arab independence. But they have stated their policy regarding the PalestinianHoly Places and Zionist colonisation in their message to him of the 4th January, 1918: 17&quot; That so far as Palestine is concerned, we are determined that no people shallbe subjected to another, but that in view of the fact:&quot; (a.) That there are in Palestine shrines, Wakfs, and Holy Places, sacred insome cases to Moslems alone, to Jews alone, to Christians alone, and in others to twoor all three, and inasmuch as these places are of interest to. vast masses of peopleoutside Palestine and Arabia, there must be a special regime to deal with theseplaces approved of by the world.&quot; (6.) That as regards the Mosque of Omar, it shall be considered as a Moslemconcern alone, and shall not be subjected directly or indirectly to any non-Moslemauthority.&quot; That since the Jewish opinion of the world is in favour of a return of Jewsto Palestine, and inasmuch as this opinion must remain a constant factor, andfurther, as His Majesty&apos;s Government view with favour the realisation of thisaspiration, His Majesty&apos;s Government are determined that in so far as is compatiblewith the freedom of the existing population, both economic and political, no obstacleshould be put in the way of the realisation of this ideal.&quot;This message was delivered personally to King Husein by Commander Hogarth,and the latter reported on his reception of it as follows : &quot; The King would not accept an independent Jewish State in Palestine, norwas I instructed to warn him that such a State was contemplated by GreatBritain. He probably knows nothing of the actual or possible economy ofPalestine, and his ready assent to Jewish settlement there is not worth verymuch. But I think he appreciates the financial advantage of Arab co-operationwith the Jews.&quot;Finally, it may be noted that King Husein was violently disturbed by theallusions to the Anglo-French Agreement of the 15th May, 1916, made in a speech byJemal Pasha at Beirout on the 30ih November, 1917, and reported in No. 101 of the&quot; Mustakbal,&quot; of Paris.18 Jemal represented that Great Britain and France would sointerpret their special position in Mesopotamia and Syria respectively as to confineKing Husein&apos;s effective power to the Hejaz. In view of the King&apos;s attitude towardsthis question recorded above, the effect upon him of Jemafs insinuation wasinevitable.Relation of Commitments regarding Meso]ptamia under (iv.) to British Desiderata.* Area. His Majesty&apos;s Government stipulated for &quot;special measures of administra-tive control&quot; in Basra and Bagdad vilayets. The Sherif, in his final statement onthe subject on the 1st January, 1916, referred to Irak, which is equivalent.N.B. In November, Faroki talked to Sir Mark Sykes about a special position forGreat Britain in &quot;Mesopotamia,&quot; and the same word is used in Sir Mark Sykes&apos;report of the Sherif&apos;s message to him on the 20th May, 1917.It is not clear whether this is simply a rendering of &quot;Irak&quot; or is intended toinclude Jezireh.Term,?.-Sherif Husein laid down no terms except a monetary compensation tohimself (as representing the Arab Confederation) for the duration of the Britishcontrol. He left the fixing of the amount to His M;vjesty&apos;s Government. HisMajesty&apos;s Government have not committed themselves to such payment or to any othercondition.Duration. Throughout the negotiations the Sherif assumed that this would belimited, and it is clear from his conversation with Captain Lawrence that he regards it asunderstood that it shall be short. His Majestys Government, on their side, havecommitted themselves to no time limit whatsoever.(v.)

10the boundaries of Arab independence claimed by him (Proposal 2). In the same arealie asked for our assent to the abolition of the Capitulations, and our assistance iusecuring- an &quot; International Convention &quot; to the same effect (Proposal 5).The proposal regarding the Capitulations was ignored by His Majesty&apos;s Governmentand does not appear to have been referred to again by the Sherif.With regard to British priority, which Sir IT. McMahon proposed to extend to thepolitical as well as the economic sphere (p. 50), the Foreign Office instructed him asfollows in their telegram of the 20th October, 19 15 : -&quot;Unless it is necessary in order to secure Arab consent, you should notinclude the stipulation that they will recognise British interests as paramount andwork under British guidance. &amp;c. Such stipulation might give rise in France tothe impression that we are aiming not only at the securing of Arab interests, butalso at the establishment of our own interests in .Syria at the expense of theFrench (p. 52).On the 24th October, 1915, in his second letter to the Sherif, Sir H. McMahoninterpreted these instructions as follows : &quot; When the situation admits, Great Britain will give to the Arabs her adviceand will assist them to establish what, may appear to be the most suitable forms ofgovernment in those territories.&quot; On the other hand, it is understood that the Arabs have decided to seek theadvice and guidance of Great Britain only, and that such European advisers andofficials as may be required for the formation of a sound form of administrationwill be British&quot; (p. 54).The point was taken up again in Sir E. Grey&apos;s telegram No. 860, of the2nd November, 1915, to Sir H. McVJahon : -&quot; I propose that my main object shall be to persuade the French Governmentto agree to include within the Arab boundaries the cities of Aleppo, Horns, Hamaand Damascus.&quot; In order to gain this point, however, we must be ready to waive thecondition that European officials and advisers of the Arab Government are to beonly British, and that the Arabs are to turn to Great Britain alone for guidanceand advice.&quot;I should like to know whether this condition was included not to meet thewishes of the Arabs but merely for the sake of our own interests. If the latter isthe case and if by dropping it Ave can obtain the concurrence of the FrenchGovernment in promising the four cities to the Arabs, I shall consider myself freeto do so in consultation with Mr. Chamberlain (Secretary of State for India). -&quot; To win the Arabs over to our side against the Turks is our vital andforemost object, not the acquisition of a new sphere of influence for ourselves &quot;(p. 60).      .This was answered by Sir IT. McMahon on the 7th November, 1915 : &quot; It was at the express request of tlvejlrabs that the clause concerning theadvice and guidance of Great Britain only, and that all advisers and officialsshould be British, was included. They do not welcome the idea of Frenchinfluence in the territories of the four cities, and were anxious to have Britishadvisers, &amp;c, there in fact, they wished the clause to apply to the whole ofArabia&quot; (p. 61).This view was in a general way corroborated by a passage in a letter, datedthe 28th December, 1916, from Sherif Husein to Sir Ali Morghani: 19&quot; It is impossible for us to acknowledge any other Power than Great Britainin our communications and representations. I say this from a purely economicpoint of view, but from the military point of view we none of us ignore thecertainty that we shall stand in great need of the power of Great Britain toextinguish any trouble that is liable to break out in the interior of the country inthe initial stages of so great changes ; more particularly because our friends20 willnot hesitate by all possible means to incite their own partisans against us for theirown ends, in spite of the fact that they will have to defend their own interests in19 30674/16. so j The other independent Arab rulers.
11the Persian Gulf and the Mediterranean until we become powerful enough todefend (them) ourselves. It is therefore necessary to take such action as willprotect British interests and at the same time will preserve all the rights ofindependence&quot; ^p. 117).Later, on the occasion of the first French Mission to the Hejaz at the beginningof October, 191G, Sherif Husein consulted His Majesty&apos;s Government throughAbdullah as to the form of his reply to the greeting brought by the Mission from theFrench Government.-1 And in the same connection he informed Colonel Wilson atJeddah that &quot;he would much prefer that no one helped him except the BritishGovernment&quot;3&apos;2 Again, in telephone conversations on the 1st November, 1916, andthe 2nd November, 1916, on the subjects of HusehVs assumption of the Royal title,Abduhah referred to Great Britain as &quot; our sole and respectable Ally,&quot; and the Kinghimself remarked that &quot; if any other Government were to ask him to do what he wasdoing now, he would not accept it, but knowing that the British Government waspopular and just, he accepted to take it.&quot;Such declarations must, of course, be discounted in view of the circumstances inwhich they were made and the fact that they were made by Orientals; but there islittle doubt that they represent the genuine desire of King Husein and his sons.Relation of Commitments under (v) to British Desiderata.His Majesty&apos;s Government have committed themselves to no special positiontowards King lluseiu which is incompatible with their agreements with France. Solong as our good relations with France do not suffer, it is clearly our interest that weshould have a predominant position with King Husein and any other Arab rulers inthe independent area. On the other hand, one of the Kings strongest motives forseeking to place us in a special position towards himself, as representative of the Arabmovement throughout the independent area, is the idea that he may eventually playus off against France. This appears, for example, in the following passage on theboundary question in his fourth letter to Sir H. McMahon of the 1st January, 1916 : &quot; I do n^t find it necessary to draw your attention to the fact that our plan isof greater security to the interests and presumption of the rights of Great Britainthan it is to us, and will necessarily be so whatever may happen, so that GreatBritain may finally see all her own peoples in that contentment and advancementwhich she is endeavouring to establish for them now; especially as her Alliesbeing neighbours to us will be the germ of difficulties and discussion with whichthere will be no peace of mind. In addition to wmich the people of Beirout willdecidedly never accept such isolation, and they may oblige us to undertakenew measurts which may exercise Great Britain, certainly not less than herpresent troubles, because of our belief and certainty in the reciprocity of ourinterests, which is the only cause that caused us never to care to negotiate withany other Power but you &quot; (p. 113).His eagerness to deal solely with us thus has its embarrassing side.(vi.) Sherif Huseirfs Title.In his correspondence with Sir H. McMahon Sherif Husein repeatedly declared himselfto be speaking in the name of the Arab people. This claim was reiterated in each ofhis first four letters (pp. 40, 45, 46, 93, 95), as well as in his letter of the 28th Decem-ber, 1915 to Sir Ali Morghani (p. 117). The most emphatic statement of it was perhapsthe following: &quot; Had it not been for the determination which I see in the Arabs for theattainment of their objects, I would have preferred to seclude myself on one of theheights of a mountain but they, the Arabs, have insisted that I should guidethe movement to this end&quot; (p. 95).Oh the question of the boundaries of Arab independence, he was at particular painsto make it clear that he was not putting forward mere personal demands but acting asmandatory ot the Arab inhabitants of the territories in question.This claim was based on his relations with the Arab Nationalist organisations,civilian and military, which had sprung up in the Arab provinces of Turkey with their21 201319/16. 22 220970/16.
12centre at Damascus, and which in the summer of 1915 (when the military strength ofthe Turks was concentrated at the Dardanelles, at the opposite extremity of the Empire)were a more effective political factor than at any time before or since.From Farokfs statement,23 we know that the Damascus Committee had given theirallegiance to Sherif Husein before he opened negotiations with Sir H. McMahon, andthat the terms he put forward (particularly on the question of boundaries) were largelysuggested by them. He virtually declared this in his fourth letter to Sir H. McMahon,on the 1st January, 1916 : &quot; Your Honour will have realised after the arrival of Mohammed (Faroki)Sherif and his interview with you, that all our procedure up to the present was ofno personal inclination or the like, which, would have been wholly unintelligible, butthat everything was the result of the decisions and desires of our peoples, and thatwe are but transmitters and executants of such decisions and desires in the positionthey (our people) have pressed upon us.&quot; These truths are in my opinion very important and deserve Your Honoursspecial attention and consideration &quot; (p. 111).This explains the large pretensions (otherwise difficult to understand) with whichthe Sberif started and which he has never given up. But before the Sherifs revolt inthe Hejaz cune to a head, the movement in Syria, irom which his initiative had come,was crushed by the Turks. From Farokfs statement it appears that the military branchwas broken up about August 1915, while the civilian leaders were mostly hanged ordeported in February 1916.2* In his fifth letter to Sir H. McMahon of the 18thFebruary, 1916, the Sherif mentioned that the Syrian movement had practically beenstamped out (p. 6, Part II), and in another letter, dated the 29th March, 1916, hestated that the Syrians were now incapable of action.25 His Majesty&apos;s Government ontheir part discouraged the Sherif from a forward poliy in Syria on the eve of his revolt,both on military grounds and for fear of political complications with France.26Thus, during the period between the beginning of the negotiations in July 1915,and the outbreak of the revolt in-the Hejaz in June 1916, the relative importance ofthe Syrian movement dwindled while that of the Sherif increased ; and when thequestion was raised of sending Faroki and al Masri, as representatives of the movement,^to Basra to get into touch with the Arabs in the Turkish Army on that front, HisMajesty&apos;s Government referred to the Sherifs claim to represent the Arab nation, andlaid down their policy as follows : 27* &quot; While there is no clear evidence as to how far this claim accords with facts,it has not been questioned by His Majesty&apos;s Government. If the claim be wellfounded, it is a matter for consideration whether independent assurances should begiven to other and ex-hypothesi less responsible Arabs.&quot;When, therefore, the Sherif threw off his allegiance to Turkey, he found hiseffective sovereignty confined to the Hejaz, as Amir ot which he was merely one amonga number of independent Arab rulers, who divided between them the allegiance of thetribes and oases of the Arabian Peninsula. The Arabs of Syria and Jezireh, whoseallegiance had promised to make him the indisputable leader of the National Movementin the (Asiatic) Arab countries, were still under the heel of the Turk, with no immediateprospect of liberation. But the title to leadership which they had enabled him toassume had been continued by the relations into which he had meanwhile entered withHis Majesty&apos;s Government; and this, together with his prestige as hereditary guardianof the Holy Cities, made it difficult for him to accept bin Saud, the Imam, the Idrisi,etc., who were his equals in fact, as his peers in honorary rank.These tacts explain the problems that have arisen over his title and his relationswith the other independent Arab Chiefs.On the 5th August, 1916, in a telegram of thanks to His Majesty the King for. hiscongratulations on the success of the Hejaz revolt, Husein signed himself, entirelycorrectly, as &quot;Sherif and Amir of Mecca,&quot; 2^ and the same signature appeared under aproclamation he issued next month to the people of Irak.2923 157740/15; cp. 152729/15: Telegram of the 16lh October, 1915, from General Maxwell to LordKitchener. 21 The Turkish account of the Arab movement, is given in &quot;-Verne&quot; sur la questionSyrienne&quot;(Sta nv onl: 19 Hi, issued by tue Fourth Turkish ArmyCommand). 25 71430/16. 26 76013/16;81915/16; 95496/16; 107964/16. &apos;2? 54229/16 : Foreign Office telegram No. 262 of the 5th Apiil, 19.6, toSir U.

13On the 29th October, 1916, however, the &quot;Ministers, Notables, Inhabitants andUlema of Mecca &quot; presented an address to Sherif Husein, in which they declared aftera long preamble : &quot; We proclaim His Majesty our Seyyid and Lord, Husein bin Ali, King of theArabs, to rule us according to the law of God and His Prophet, and we swear toyou the oath of loyalty and obedience, secretly and openly; and in addition weconsider you as a final religious authority, which fact we have agreed upon pendingthe decision of the Moslem World regarding the Caliphate.&quot;30Sherif Husein declared on his part: &quot; This sentiment of loyalty does not belong only to the inhabitants of thiscountry, but the Arabs of Syria and Irak likewise are yearning to be united withus and to restore (heir freedom and glory. I have received messages from theirnotables to this effect.&quot;On the same day Sherif Abdullah telegraphed as follows to Sir&apos;H. McMahon andto the Governments of all Allied and Neutral countries : &quot; Je suis tres heureux de vous informer que les notables, les ulemas du payset toutes les classes de la population, s&apos;etant reunis aujourd&apos;hui, ont a l^manimitereconnu Sa Majeste&quot; le Grand Cherif Hussein-ben-Aly &apos;Boi de la nation arabe.1Sa Majeste&apos; devient de ce fait Souverain des Arabes, etant donne que le pays estpenetre de sa capacite diplomatique, de sa parfaite loyaute&quot; envers sa patrie, et deson cldsir sincere de repandre les bienfaits de rinstruction et de la justice danstoutes les regions arabes delivrees du joug de la bande Union et Progres.&quot; La nation arabe a tout lieu desperer que vous la reconnaitrez membre actifdans la societe des nations, et connue telle.   Elle le prouvera dans 1&apos;avenir.&quot; Avec 1&apos;appui du Tout-Puissant, veuillez agreer, etc.(Signe)    &quot; Le Ministre des Affaires Etrangeres du Gouvernement arabe,le Cherif Abdullah.&quot; 31Sherif Husein was duly crowned &quot;King of the Arabs&quot; at Mecca, on the 4thNovember, 1916,33 and there was a simultaneous ceremony at Jeddah, which was not,however, attended by the French and British representatives.33On the 2nd November, 191ii, in bis telegram No. 961 to the Foreign Office, Sir H.McMahon suggested that, in view of our treaties recognising the independence of otherArab Chiefs, we could only recognise Sherif Husein as &quot;King (Malik) of the Hejaz&quot;.34On the 3rd November, 1916, the Foreign Office telegraphed to Sir H. McMahon(No. 880) that the Sherif might be congratulated but not yet accorded recognition, andthat the French Government desired to conform their action to that of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment.35On the 6th November, 1916, the Foreign Office telegraphed to Sir R. Wingate(Khartoum) the following instructions for a reply to Sherit Abdullah on behalf of theGovernments of Great Britain, France and Russia: ;36&quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Governments of France and Russia,though they regard, and will continue to regard, His Highness as the titular headof the Arab peoples in their revolt against Turkish misrule, and are glad further torecognise him as the lawful and de facto ruler of the Hejaz, are unable torecognise the assumption by him of any sovereign title which might provokedisunion among Arabs at the present moment and thus prejudice the finalpolitical settlement of Arabia on a satisfactory basis. That settlement, to bedurable, must be come to with the general assent of other Arab rulers, of which atpresent there is no evidence, and must follow, rather than precede, militarysuccess,&quot;On the 9th November, 1916, Sir H. McMahon telegraphed to the Foreign Office(No. 991) demurring to the expression &quot;titular head&quot; ; and the French Governmentproposed the substitution for the words &quot;Arab race&quot; of the words &quot;populationof Arabia.&quot; 3730 240121/16.

14On the 15th November, 1016, Lord Bertie telegraphed that the French Govern-ment had instructed Colonel Bremond not to address the Sherif as &quot; His Majesty.&quot; 38On the 27th November, 1916, the French Government suggested to His Msijesty&apos;sGovernment, through their Ambassador in London, that Sherif Huseins title shouldbe &quot;Malik al Haramein&quot; (King of the two Holy Cities) and his style Siyadiya(&quot; Seigneurie,&quot; or &quot;Lordship&quot;).30On the 4th December, 1916, Sir R. Wingate telegraphed (No. 53) that, in the replyfrom His Majesty&apos;s Government to the Sherif, which by this time had been despatched,he had styled him &quot; Sahib al Siyada.&quot; But he criticised the proposed title of &quot; Malikal Haramein &quot; on account of its possible religious connotation.40 It was also objected toon the same grounds by Sir H. McMahon and by the India Office,&apos;11 and both proposedindependently the title &quot; King of the Hejaz,&quot; which had been Sir H. McMahoifsoriginal suggestion.A telegram was accordingly sent to Sir Pt. Wingate instructing him to address theSherif as &quot;His Lordship &quot; (Si)rada) &quot;the King (Malik) of Hejaz,&quot; and this style and titlehave been adhered to since.42 At the same time Colonel Wilson was instructed, at thesuggestion of the India Office, to explain to the Sherif that the limitation of the titledid not affect the Agreement between His Majesty&apos;s Government and him.4,3The Sherif did not question His Majesty&apos;s Governments decision (presumablybecause he knew himself to have been in the wrong in acting without their knowledge),but it is evident that he considers that the wider title is properlv his.For example, in January, 1917, he seems to have composed a second message to thepeople of Irak in which he signed himself&quot; King of the Arab country and Sherif andAmir of Mecca.&quot; 44 Again, when he was asked by Commander Hogarth iu January,1918,45 to compose a message for the Arabs of Jerusalem, he proposed to sign it as &quot; Kingof the Arabs&quot; or &quot; of the Arab nation&quot; ; and even when he abandoned this signature,he drafted the message in terms which implied this title so patently that liehad to be prevailed upon to draft it again.&quot; It is obvious,&quot; Commander Hogarth wrote, in his report to Sir R. WTingateon this mission, &quot;that the King regards Arab unity as synononious with hisown kingship, and as a vain phrase unless so regarded.....&quot;While the King accepted without demur His Majesty&apos;s Governments&apos;declaration on this matter, as conveyed in Foreign Office telegram No. 6 of the6th November, 1916, to yourself, he left me in little doubt that he secretly regardsthis as a point to be reconsidered alter the Peace, in spite of my assurance that itwas to be a definitive arrangement. He compared ourselves and himself (in hishabitual homely way) to two persons about to inhabit one house but notagreed which should take which floor or rooms. Often in the course of ourconversations he spoke with a smile of accounts which he would settle afterthe war, pending which settlement he would press nothing. I doubt if he has anyfixed plan or foresees his way ; but I have no doubt that in his own mindhe abates none of his original demands on behalf of the Arabs, or in the fulness oftime, of himself.&quot;Relation of Commitments under (vi.) to British Desiderata.His Majesty&apos;s Government avoided according Sherif Husein a title incompatiblewith their commitments to other independent Arab rulers, while the title which theyhave recognised does not conflict with the wider claims of the Sherif to which theyconsented in the previous negotiations.But though His Majes y&apos;s Governments position on this question may be sutis-factory on paper, it is far irom being so in fact. The harm done by the Sherifscowpd&apos;Etat of the 29th October, 1916, has never been repaired. The other independentArab rulers have not been inwardly reassured by our restriction of the Sherifs title tothe Hejaz; while he, on his part, has only accepted this restriction as provisional.The problem has been postponed, not solved.38 2902*5/16. 3&quot; 210161/16.40 214179/16.

15(vii.) Treaties and Agreements between His Majesty&apos;s Government and other Arab rulersin the independent area.The boundaries of Arab independence assented to by Sir H. McMahon on the24th October, 1915, in his second letter to Sherif Husein, included not only (a) Arabterritories still subject to the Turk, but also (6) the dominions of independent Arabrulers like the Sultans of Mokalla and Maskat, the Trucial Chiefs, and the Sheikh ofKoweit, with whom His Majesty&apos;s Government had treaties, in some cases of more thanhalf a century&apos;s standing; and (c) the dominions of Arab rulers, like bin Saud and theIdrisi, whom His Majesty&apos;s Government had recognised before the war as being withinthe Turkish sphere, but with whom we had since made agreements, or were on thepoint of making them. (The Treaty with the ldrisi was signed on the 30th April,1915, before Sherif Iiusein had opened negotiations with us, and that with bin Saud onthe 2Gth December, 1915, before we had concluded them with him.)Sir H. McMahon, therefore, stated in his letter that &quot;we accept these limits andboundaries without prejudice to our existing treaties with Arab Chiefs&quot; (p. 53).The point does not appear to have been taken up by the Sherif until his thirdletter of the 5th November, 1915, in which, apropos of British administration in Irak,he wrote that he might consent to it &quot; for a short time, without the rights of eitherside being prejudiced thereby (especially those of the Arab Nation, which interests areeconomic and vital io it) . . . . at the same time respecting your agreements with theSheikhs of those districts, and especiallv those which are essential &quot;(p. 93).On the 10th December, 1915, the Foreign Office, in a telegram of instructions toSir II. McMahon, laid it down that: &quot;It should be made clear to the Sherif that when we spoke of our existingagreements with Sheikhs being upheld, we reierred to the Arabian Peninsula noless than Mesopotamia &quot; (p. 102).And in his third letter of the 13th December, 1915, Sir H. McMahon embodiedthese instructions as follows : &quot;In stating that the Arabs are ready to recognise and respect all our treatieswith Arab Chiefs, it is of course understood that this will apply to all territoriesincluded in the Arab Kingdom, as the Government of Great Britain cannotrepudiate engagements which already exist.&quot;This stipulation was ignored by the Sherif in his fourth letter of the 1st November,1916, and do?s not appear to have been&apos; referred to again during the negotiations.After the outbreak of the revolt and the reduction of the Turkish garrisons atMecca, Jeddah and Taif, Abdullah, as Sherifial &quot; Minister for Foreign Affairs,&quot; appearsto have sent messages announcing the victory to the neighbouring Arab rulers, to whichboth bin Saud and the chief of the Hashid and Bekil Confederation sent extremelycourteous, though non-committal, replies.&apos;&quot;1Bin Saud was also informed of the Hejaz revolt officially by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment through Sir P. Cox. In his reply to the latter,47 dated the 20th July, 1916(or 25th July,, f 916), he expressed pleasure at the event as a blow to the Turks and asuccess for H.s Majesty s Government, but intimated doubts as to Sherif Husein&apos;sintentions, mentioned that he and the Sherif had been at war for years over demarcationand allegiance questions, and took exception to the fact that &quot; in the- official communiquemention was made of&apos; the Arabs&apos; as if they were a compendious whole.&quot;Early in August, 1916, Sherif Husein appears to have written a second letter tobin Saud, asking for &quot;alliance&quot; and &quot;assistance.&quot; Bin Saud reported this toSir P. Cox in a letter elated the 15th August, 1916, and expressed even graver concernat the Sherifs intentions than before.48 Sir P. Cox submitted that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment should assure bin Saud that their treaty with him would be adhered to,and that they should communicate the terms of it to the Sherif. Both Sir P. Cox&apos;ssuggestions were adopted,49 and the text of His Majesty&apos;s Governments treaty withbin Saud was conveyed to the Sherif by Colonel Wilson on the 30th October, 1916.50On the 1st November, 1916, Sherif Abdullah, in his telephonic communication toColonel Wilson,51 regarding the proclamation of his father as &quot; King of the Arabs &quot; twoclays before, defined the position of the other independent Arab rulers as follows : is Translations in 242002/16. *7 182-136/16; full translation in 231939/16 (No. 52).48.ia5Sl/16. 4* 183725/16 and 187737/16. 6U 219296/16. &quot; 242002/16.
16&quot; As for bin Saud, be is a Sheikh of Arabs and the Sherif does not interferewith his work or his land. Let every one rule his part, it does not make anydifference.&quot; As for the Idrisi, he is a man who is not recognised by anyone to beanything. He has made himself Sheikh and landed in some places which were notruled by anyone.&quot;As for Imam Yahya, let him govern his part of the land, but he will notdeny the fact that the Amir of Mecca should be the ruler of Hejaz; and King ofArabs.&quot; As for the Arab tribes, none of them would oppose the Sherifs declaringhimself King of the Arabs.&quot; The history of the Amir of Mecca goes back to the Abbasides.&quot; It is not important whether these people would agree or not.&quot;In his telephonic conversation later on the same day he added the followingsomewhat more satisfactory but still equivocal assurances : &quot; Bin Saud, Idrisi, &amp;c, are rulers in their places, and we would not interferewith them. They are respected, and if anyone were to attack them we have tohelp them.&quot; Our boundaries were settled before the rising, and therefore we have no otherambition, as terms were concluded before that Kingdom of the Sherif will be up.   to Iraq.&quot; Our respect to this treaty concluded between us and Great Britain forbidsus to oppose them, and such is well known to you.&quot;This attitude was confirmed by Sherif Husein himself in a letter to Colonel Wilsondated the 4th November, 1916, and he defended it by enclosing copies of the letters to himfrom bin Saud and the chief of the Hashid and Bekil Confederation, referred to above.These letters had, of course, no bearing on the assumption of the title &quot; King of theArabs,&quot; since they were written several months before, on the occasion of his revoltagainst the Turks.On the 6th November, 1916, His Majesty&apos;s Government took note of Abdullahsassurances, such as they were, in their instructions to Sir R. Win^ate for the officialreply to Abdullatfs circular telegram announcing; the assumption of the royal title.52Meanwhile, bin Saud had apparently answered the Sherifs second letter to himby expressing readiness to co-operate, but asking for assurances that the Sherif wouldno lot ger encroach on what bin Saud regarded as his own tribal sphere.The Sherif returned this letter unanswered with a &quot;most discourteous andarrogant&quot; covering note.53 And he sent equally unsatisfactory rep ies to congratulatoryletters from the Sheikhs of Mohammerah and Koweit.54Upon receiving a report of this from the India Office, the Foreign Office tele-graphed the following message to the Sirdar on the 25th November, 1916 (No. 24), 65for transmission to the Sherif: &quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government learnt with great regret that the three greatArab Chiefs, the Sheikhs of Mohammerah and Koweit and bin Saud, have reasonto feel aggrieved at the reception of their advances by the Sherif. His Majesty&apos;sGovernment are convinced that such an incident is entirely contrary to the wishesand intentions of the Sherif himself, and that it is no doubt due to an oversighton the part of his subordinates; but they must observe that, in view of the verysatisfactory attitude of the three Sheikhs in question, the Sherifs own interests, noless than courtesy towards His Majesty&apos;s Government, require him to meet theadvances of the King&apos;s Allies with civility and even with cordiality. HisMajesty&apos;s Government are using all their influence to secure the cordial co-opera-tion of all Arabs with the Sherif, but their efforts will hi of no avail if the Sherifhimself repels those whom His Majesty&apos;s Government have attracted to, hissupport.&quot;In response to this message, the Sherif sent two telegrams to the three Sheikhs,the one congratulating them in turn on their conference with Sir P. Cox at Koweit in53 221869/16.63 236884/16   Telegram of the 21st November, 1917. from Sir P. Cox.64 It does not appear whether the congratulations were for the Sherifs coronation or for some previousevent.55 236884/16.
17November,50 and the other making fairly satisfactory amends for his previous behaviour/&apos;7In the second telegram he explained his relation to the general movement for ArabIndependence in the following terms, which are practically, identical with thoseemployed during his negotiations with His Majesty&apos;s Government: &quot;You and I are friends and Allies of the British Government, the powerfulfriend of the Arabs, and we should unite and co-operate with each other to expelthe Turkish tricksters, our personal enemies and the enemies of the truth, and topurge the Arab country from their vileness and iniquity. This is the firstnecessity and everything else will follow. I have absolutely no personal ambitionin this matter; my objects are to secure our safety (yours and my own), and theintegrity of the Arabian country and its purification from the wickedness andseries (? the lies) of the deceitful Turks.&quot;   -On the 12th December, 1916, the Sheikh of Koweit returned a suitable reply, andthis particular incident was closed.58 The relations of Sherif Husein with the Idrisiand bin Saud, however, have caused His Majesty&apos;s Government perpetual difficulties.On the 20th May, 1917, on the occasion of the meeting between the Sherif andM. Picot and Sir Mark Sykes at Jeddah,59 Faisal gave Sir Mark Sykes the followingmessage from his father : &quot; We are ready to co-operate with France in Syria to the fullest extent andEngland in Mesopotamia., but we ask for help from England with Idrisi andbin Saud, without in any way infringing on their independence. We beg thatGreat Britain will endeavour to induce them to recognise Kings position as leaderof Arab movement.&quot;The Foreign Office consulted with the India Office as to how far it was possible toobtain recognition from the Idrisi and bin Saud of Sherif Husein&apos;s special position asleader of the Arab movement,00 and the question was referred respectively to theResident at Aden and to Sir P. Cox. Both reported that the moment was inopportune,and the matter was not proceeded with.01The difficulties between1 the Sherif and the Idrisi over Kunfida in August, 1916,62and between the Sherif and bin Saud over Khonna in the summer of 1918, do not fallwithin the scope of the present section. . They were essentially demarcation andallegiance disputes between the Sherif, in his quality of a local Arab ruler, and hisnearest neighbours, and the question of his rank and relation to the Arab Movementwas not technically involved. There is no doubt, however, that these and otherdisputes of the kind have been and will be considerably embittered by the presence ofthis larger question in the background.Relation of Commitments wider (vii) to British Desiderata.All commitments hitherto made by His Majesty&apos;s Government to the Sherif on theone part and the other independent Arab rulers on the other appear to be compatiblewith one another.On the other hand, the problem of retaining the goodwill of the Sherif andsecuring him the position required by British and French desiderata in Mesopotamia,Palestine and Syria, while at the same time retaining the confidence of the otherindependent Chiefs, remains unsolved.(viii.) The Caliphate.On the 31st October, 1914, Lord Kitchener, in his second message to Sherif Abdullahwrote : &quot; It may be that an Arab of true race will assume the Khalifate at Mecca orMedina, and so good may come by the help of God out of all the evil that is nowoccurring.&quot;On the strength of this message, Abdullah, on the occasion of King Huseinscoronation in November 1916, and His Majesty&apos;s Governments message of congratulation56 241296/16. 67 248796/16. 68 251680/16. ^ 104209/17. 60 117999/17.61 126081/17, 137978/17, 141413/17 (the Idrisi) and 15262.i/17, 118989/17, 119702/17 .(biu Saud).62 182183/16 aud 215155/16 (No. 142).[883] F
18on that event, telegraphed in Husein&apos;s name to Colonel Wilson at Jeddah, conveyingthanks to His Majesty&apos;s Government &quot; which once addressed him as Caliph.&quot;63   Whenpressed on the point by-Colonel Wilson, Abdullah admitted over the telephone that noletter was ever addressed to Sherif Husein as Caliph, and quoted the text of Lord   *Kitchener&apos;s message with sufficient accuracy.01&apos;That message, did not, of course, commit His Ma,jesty&apos;s Government to more thanthe pious hope that the question of the Caliphate would be dealt with in a certainmanner by the Moslems themselves. But the incident mentioned above shows howdangerous even the most guarded reference to the Caliphate by His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment may be, and it is a danger that will increase as we approach the peace settlement.Any possible ambiguity in Lord Kitchener&apos;s message was removed bv His Majesty&apos;sGovernments more detailed declaration in the same sense, conveyed in the ForeignOffice Telegram No. 173 of the 14th April, 1915, to Sir H. McMahon:-&quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government consider that the question of Khalifate is onewhich must be decided by Mohammedans themselves without interference of non-Mohammedan Powers. Should the former decide for an Arab Khalifate, thatdecision would therefore naturally be respected by His Majesty&apos;s Government, butthe decision is one for Mohammedans to make &quot; (p. 30).This declaration evoked an important memorandum, dated the 6th May, 1915,from Sir Ali Morghani, Grand Kadi of the Sudan, in which he argued that SherifHusein was the most suitable candidate for the Caliphate, and that if he receivedunobtrusive support from His Majesty&apos;s Government, he had good prospects of obtainingrecognition from a majority of Islam,   (pp. 32 seqq.)In July 1915, in his first letter to Sir H. McMahon, Sherif Husein demanded that&quot; England should approve of the proclamation of an Arab Caliphate of Islam &quot; (p. 40).In this he was no doubt encouraged by Lord Kitcheners message, and stimulated by hisown ambition for the office, but it appears that he was also prompted, as he was on theboundary question, by the Nationalist Committee at Damascus. Faroki, in his statementat Cairo in October 1915,65 mentioned that when he was stationed at Damascus(apparently early in the winter-of 1914-15, before the first Turkish attack on theCanal) he found that the civilian committee there &quot; had already paid allegiance to theSherif of Mecca as Caliph and renounced allegiance to Reshad the Sultan of Turkey.Our first action, therefore, after joining that society was that we sent an officer to theSherif of Mecca, and he paid him allegiance on behalf of all the officers in our party andrenounced our allegiance to Beshad.&quot;He further stated that one of the formal aims of the Arab Party was that &quot; SherifHusein of Mecca should be Caliph and Sultan of the new Empire.&quot;In conversation with General Clayton he added that :-&quot;The members of the Society have taken a solemn oath on the Koran thatthey will enforce their object and establish an Arab Caliphate in Arabia, Syria,and Mesopotamia at all costs and under any circumstances, sacrificing for this objectall their efforts and property and, if need be, their lives.&quot;The fact, which thus seems established, that Sherif Husein, before opening-negotiations with us, was offered the Caliphate by an organisation which might reason-ably claim at that time to represent the Arab nation in the Ottoman provinces, at anyrate in Syria, may be of some importance when the question comes up for settlement.On the 30th August, 1918, Sir H. McMahon, in his first letter to the Sherif,answered the latter^ demand regarding the Caliphate by repeating Lord Kitchener&apos;smessage to Abdullah. He interpreted this as &quot;approval of the Arab Caliphate whenit should be proclaimed,&quot; and added: &quot; We declare onee more that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment wrould welcome the resumption of the Caliphate by an Arab of true race &quot;(p. 43).On the 2nd November, I915,fi(i the Aga Khan called on Sir E. Grey and protestedagainst the idea of an Arab Caliphate in the name of the Indian Moslems, and Sir E.Grey gave him an assurance in the following terms:  ;&quot; I said that we were prepared to favour an independent or autonomousArabia in the country inhabited by the Arabs; but anything that we promised to[     the Arabs, or any action that we took to support them, would be of a political and6S 224419/16 and 224579/16. Gi 226649/16. ^ 157740/15. to 164776/15.
19secular character. We regarded the Khalifate as a thing which should be settledby Moslems for themselves, and in which neither we nor any non-Moslem Powershould interfere.&apos;&apos;The Aga Khan expressed himself quite satisfied, but asked that, in all communi-cations with the Arabs, His Majesty V Governments attitude should be made very clear.A record of this conversation was transmitted to Sir H. McMahon and Sir R. Wingate.On the 17th November, 1915, after receiving from Sir II. McMahon a revisedsummary of the Sherifs third letter of the 5th November, L915, the Foreign Officetelegraphed to the former (No. 8S7)r&apos;7: &quot;You will, of course, bear carefully in-mind the necessity of avoiding allpossibility of being involved in any questions concerning the Caliphate.&quot;The subject was accordingly ignored by Sir H. McMahon in the subsequentnegotiations.Sherif Husein. however, gave a clearer indication of his policy on the question inhis letter of the 28th December, 1915, to Sir Ali Morghanios: &quot; I bad not claimed before to be the qualified chief of the Amirs (the Caliph),but I explained to them more than once that I was ready to extend my hand toany man who would come forward and take the reins of authority.&apos; I was,however, chosen in every quarter and even forced to take up the question of theirfuture piospeets; and, therefore, I can see no ground for making (further)conditions, such as the universal agreement of the Amirs and tribes which werementioned, especially the &apos; Shias,&apos; i.e., the Persians, who lack the necessvuyqualificMtions and every other right (to decide the question of the chosen Caliphof Islam)&quot; (p. 118).The above passage lends significance to the declaration contained in the addresspresented to Sherif Husein on the &apos;29th October, 19L6, by the &quot; Ministers, Notables,Inhabitants and Ulerna of Mecca,&quot;m to the effect that &quot;We take the oath ofobedience, loyalty and sincerity to Husein bin Ali, and consider him also to be ourreligious leader until all the Moslem world be of one opinion concerning the IslamicCaliphate.&quot; And Sherif AbdulLh emphasised this declaration in his short telegram ofthe 29th October, 1916, to Colonel Wilson, announcing the proclamation of his fatheras king.In conversation over the telephone with Colonel Wilson on the 1st November,1916,70 Abdullah explained that: &quot;His Majesty the Sherif has left the question of the Caliphate to the opinionof the Moslem world, and, therefore, he declared that there was no pre-suggestedCaliphate, but that the whole question&apos; is left to the public opinion of Islam, andthe Ulema of the Qibla decided not to accept the Turkish Caliphate, and thewhole question will come back later on to its origin.&quot;In a similar conversation on the following day, King Husein himself declared: &quot; I have denied the Caliphate entirely and officially, leaving it to the opinionof those who know all about its regulations, until all Moslems choose one personto be their Caliph.....&quot;I repeat that our not declaring the Caliphate will not put us in anysuspicion, until all Moslems are of one. opinion. It is a question of dissociatingthe Moslems from the Turks.&quot;On the 6th November, 1916, the Foreign Office telegraphed instructions toSir R. Wingate for a reply to Abdullaffs communication71; and in this telegramHis Majesty&apos;s Governments policy regarding the Caliphate was once more laid down,as follows: &quot; That it should be strongly impressed on the Sherif that his own interestsrequire that the question of the Caliphate should be left open until the end of thewar; that it would be quite impossible for Christian Powers, numbering among theirsubjects many millions of Moslems, to expose themselves to the charge of takingsides in the affairs of Islam and forcibly supporting one Caliph against another,and that his claims could only be weakened by such support in the eyes of theMoslem world.&quot;w 172410/15. 08 30074/16.69 233117/10; see al o 249121/16 (extract from &quot; Al Qibla&quot;). 70 242002,16. 71 221869/16.
20A reply in this sense was eventually conveyed to King Husein by Colonel Wilson.&quot;3In his conversation with Colonel Wilson on the 2nd November 1916, quoted above,the Sherif twice spoke of the Caliphate as being in abeyance, and mentioned that hepossessed a book by a Wahabi authority in which this was demonstrated, and which hewould publish if necessary.He developed this thesis further in a conversation with Captain Lawrence onthe 2bth July 1917,73 and the latter received the impression that he was genuinelyaverse from the idea of reviving the office in his own person. For the &quot; false Caliphate &quot;of the Osmanlis he would prefer, it seems,.to substitute a spiritual leadership of Islamin his own family with some such title as Amir al Muminin, if this were genuinely offeredto him. His view appears to be that the spiritual leader of Islam should not aim atbeing the political sovereign of the whole Moslem world, but that the office should becombined with a small temporal sovereignty for instance, over the Hejaz and its HolyCities in order to secure the holder of it the independence necessary to his position.   -In fact, according to this conversation, Sherif Husein aims at a position very likethat of the Papacy when it possessed the temporal power over the Estates of theChurch.If this is the Sherifs real view, it is remarkably divergent from the chauvinistictrend of opinion concerning the Caliphate which seems to be more common amongMoslems at present. And it remains to be seen how he would regard the title of Caliphif it were actually placed within his grasp.Relation of commitments under (viii) to British desiderata.His Miijesty&apos;s Government have succeeded so far in making it clear that theyregard the question of the Caliphate as a purely Moslem affair, without causing SherifHusein to doubt their goodwill towards his aspirations in the matter.We have two purely negative desiderata avoidance of offence on the one hand toMoslem opinion and on the other hand to the Sherif which have to be reconciled withone another, and hitherto we have avoided committing ourselves in either direction ina way that would compromise us in the other.o^ There appears to be no record in the Foreign Office of the final text of this note, the drafting of-which was left to the discretion of Sir R. Wingate, Colonel Bremond, and Colonel YVilsjn.73 174974/17
