(THIS DOCUOl-IT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MJISSTY&apos;S^GQVlSR^jSgT.SECRET.       \ -\ V        W A R   CABINET.0.T.-6197. &apos; &quot; ;HOTJGING ACCCLihOpATIOi: PGR SHIPYARBS.Memorandum by Controiler General of MerchantShipbuilding.I desire to bring to the notice of the V&quot;ar Cabinet theurgent and pressing need for the provision of additionalHousing accommodation in connection with the Shipyards and tourge as strongly as possible that the erection of such houses ,shall be undertaken at once and carried out under the highestpossible priority that can be granted,I have recently been on a tour of inspection ofpractically every shipbuilding area in the Country and innearly every district I find that the work in the shipyardsis being hampered by the lack of suitable housing for thebetter class of workmen.   Hostels have, it is true, beenequipped in certain areas hut these are only temporary measuresand moreover are only devised to meet the needs of single men.The Works Construction Sub-Committee of the War PrioritiesCommittee have recently refused to grant any degree ofpriority for a scheme for the erection of houses where a .new yard has &quot;been completed,  the men actually ready to startwork in the yard and where the-labour for the constructionof the houses is available.I would urge that this Committee be instructed to grantto Shipbuilders, who in many cases have expressed their readi-ness to undertake such work for their own employees,  everyfacility for the erection of houses in the Shipyard areas inorder that when the additional men to be employed on ship con-stru&amp;tion are available, there shall be no delay or inconveniencaused by lack of suitable housing accommodation.    I regard thiprovision of additional housing accommodation as of the utmostimportance if the output of tonnage in this Country is to beincreased.( Sd,)    BIRRIE,Controller General of MerchaShipbuilding..Admiralty.4th Foveraber, 1918.
