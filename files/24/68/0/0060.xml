(1).30th October, 1918.Sir,    - -,-,,.T beg to submit the following Report on the work of the,Food Production Department for the week ended 29th October:-The Weather and Condition-of Crops.There was a considerable improvement in the weatherexperienced during the past week.   Land is drying quickly inmost districts, arid good progress was made generally in autumncultivation and the sowing of autumn corn.There is still some corn which has not yet beencarried, in the hilly and late districtsj in a few cases there iscorn not cut, a good deal of which, it Is feared, is so badlydamaged as to make the crops almost useless even for feedingpurposes.   Threshing operations are in progress throughout thecountry, and in many counties better results are being obtainedthan were anticipated.Progress has also been made in the lifting of thepotato crop, which promises a fairly good yield comparativelyfree from disease.Roots are being pulled in many districts, and thereports received indicate that,they are..up to the average yield.Pastures, are now becoming.,bare and are likely toprovide little keep for cattle in,the near future.LOCAL ORGANISATION.DIVISION&apos;,   &apos;.Agricultural Executive Committeesi&apos;i[&apos;/&apos;)&apos;...Dorset.   In August, 1917,. the Commijt-t ee consulted the -Departmentas to the advisability of cultivating Lenthay Common, and asked&quot;- 1 &quot;-
for advice as to the best method of procedure.   After somenegotiations the Commoners agreed that the Common should be leton lease for six years, on condition that it should be laid downagain to pasture if so required.    Jr December, 1917, the Committ;accordingly undertook the cultivation of this land, with theapproval of the Department, and appointed an agent to superintendthe work.   The Department have now received a most satisfactoryreport on the work done;   excellent crops have been produced, andit is expected that a net profit of  500 will be realised,Sussex, Bast. . The Committee have been authorised to take possess!Of a much neglected farm (166, acres) at We3tham near Eastbourne.The1 condition of this farm has repeatedly been considered by theCommittee, and the owner has been,given every- opportunity of -improving its cultivation and increasing his stock.   In March ofthis year, however, it was reported still to,be an absolute disgrthe buildings neglected, the yards covered with grass, the hedgeiuntrimmed and the fences broken, and much the same report wasreceived by the Executive Committee in September.   The farm Isparticularly suited ;f or milk production,, and owing to the, formatlof an Aviation Training School in this district ,muoh-.land.pre.viO&apos;used for milk production is no longer available,   and a shortageof milk In Eastbourne and the surrounding district has in-consequresulted.    The Committee, therefore, felt obliged in the interefiof food production to take possession,; of the farm, and have arratfto let it to two 4airy farmers in the,neighbourhood, a largeproportionof whose-grazing land has been commandeered by theAviation School,,and,who were ;in consequence threatened;with thenecessity of reducing,.their stock. .P/arwickshlre,..., ,In-December, 1917, the Committee had under . Iconsideration the question of taking possession of ,a badly negloc
9 AOfarm at Ilmington.   The owner-occupier, however, petitionedvery strongly that he might be given a further chance to putthe land into better cultivation, and this request was granted.The farm has now been inspected again, and is reported to begenerally in a very foul condition, and the hedges and ditchesin a disgraceful state.     The Committee have accordingly boonauthorised to take possession and to arrange for its bettercultivation.Prosecutions.   The owner of several farms in the parish ofLoysters, Herefordshire, was served last -January with fournotices ordering the better cultivation of the land, and inthe following August with four further notices ordering certainspecific acts of cultivation.   Almost no effort was made tocarry out the orders * a.nd upon the Committee reporting thatthe farms were still in a very neglected and almost derelictcondition, authority to undertake a prosecution was given bythe Department.      The Committee now report that fines of  100have been inflicted on four of the. summonses&apos;, and fines of 50 and  40 respectively on two * of the other summonses, making,in all, a total of  490.   In Northamptonshire a farmer has beenfined  20 for failure to comply with a cultivation noticeserved upon him by the Committee, and a fine of  10 has beeninflicted upon a farmer in Northumberland for a similaroffence-Crops destroyed by Insect Pests.     On 24th May, 1918, amemorandum was issued authorising Executive Committees tosupply seed free of charge for re-sowing crops on ploughed upgrass land on which the crop had been destroyed by insectpests.      This measure was taken as a matter of urgency inorder to secure that some alternative crop should be sown- 3 -
forthwith for the production of food for this year&apos;8 harveaOnly three Committees have exercised the authority, elevenfarmers either being supplied with fresh seed or reimbursedfor the cost of the first sowing.    The total expenditureamounted to  244. 14s. lid.Damage by Game.     Action under the Rabbits Order is report?from Herefordshire.Determination of Tenancies. During the past week 2 Ordersbeen made-determining tenancies on account of bad farming irespect of 75 acres.HORTICULTURAL DIVISION.Provision of Land for Allotments. During the week 31 locaauthorities have agreed to acquire a total area of 504 acre(6,748 allotments), including 83 acres at East Ham, 70 acreat Sheffield, and 100 acres at Walsall.It is proposed to a3k local authorities to submitreturn of the total number of allotments provided to date,of the numbers provided under (a) the Small Holdings Act,(b) Cultivation of Lands Order, 1917 (No.2), (c) by privatetreaty,   Local authorities will be requested to makesupplementary returns twice a year in future, in order thatthese figures may be kept up to date,Fruit Section.   A conference called by the Horticultural SuCommittee was held at Worcester during the past week, and ifattended by representatives of the Horticultural Division.Arrangements were made for the co-ordination of technicalhorticultural advice to be given throughout the county.With the object of combating Silver Leaf Disease,inspections have been made of plum plantations round PersjA.and Evesham.
TECHNICALDIVISION.................................-...................-.............Reduction of Sheep Flocks.   The results of an enquiry recentlymade by the Teohnical Committee into the causes and extent ofthe decrease this year in the number of sheep, particularlyhurdle sheep kept in the western and south-western counties,are now available.   There appears to have been a considerablereduction of sheep flocks in the following districts:- Hampshire,Oxfordshire, Wiltshire, Somerset, Devon  and Cornwall.   In somecases the reduction is stated to have been going on for someyears.    The recent reduction is attributed to the followingcauses:-        (1) Scarcity of concentrated food, which hasaffected the breeding flocks as well as the hurdle sheep.(2) The high prices obtainable for ewes, which have temptedfarmers to sell to the butcher.   (3) The action of the FoodController in fixing the same price for mutton and lamb, whichhas discouraged farmers from producing fat lambs.   The fixedprice, being also too low in proportion to the cost ofproduction, has tempted them to fatten off the ewes, which feedmore quickly than young sheep.   (4) The ploughing up of grassland.   (5&quot;5 The high price of hay.   (6) The expected partialfailure of the root crop.Utilisation of Straw.   In view of the increase in the area undercereals, investigations have been in progress for some time pastinto methods by which the straw crop might be economicallyutilised.   An interim report has been submitted of experimentsmade at the Rothamsted Experimental Station on the use of strawfor soil treatment.   On the basis of the results already obtained,it is suggested that a more liberal use of straw as litter wouldprobably lead to a diminution of the losses of ammonia, whichoccur in the making of farmyard manure.    The results also givosome ground for believing that it may be practicable later on- 5 -
to produce a material resembling farmyard manure In compositeand physical condition by the use of straw and some extraneousform of nitrogen, without the intervention of the animal. Theinvestigation is being pursued in various directions.LABOUR DIVISION.Harvest Labour.   The number of soldiers specially released foj-    - j *harvest work and still out on farms is 3,930. An additionalnumber of soldiers has been allocated to Lincolnshire andShropshire in order to secure the remainder of the potato hanThe War Office have now sanctioned an extension of leave to tisoldiers granted furlough for the ingathering of the harvest,a period of 14 days, making a maximum furlough of three calenjmonths.Soldier Labour. Several thousand substitutes for Categorysoldiers of agricultural companies have been brought over froiFrance, and aro now arriving at the distribution centres. Tinmajority of these substitutes are ploughmen. The Departmentare in communication with the 7/ar Office as to the withdrawalof the Category &quot;A&quot; men,&apos; who, being ploughmen, have been aliato remain on the land to assist with the autumn cultivations.It is important that these men should be retained if possiblePrisoners of 7/ar. Arrangements have now been made with the ltyOffice which allow that a number of migratory gangs of Germanprisoners equivalent to those sent out for harvest work shallprovided for threshing and other urgent agricultural work.Substitutes will be available.- from parent camps, for thoijeprisoners borrowed from other Government Departments for theharvest period, and Commands have been authorised to supply sijsubstitutes up to the maximum number of prisoners thusborrowed.- 6 -
9 .1 Cw ;i uWomen&apos;3 Branch.Training and Employment..- &apos; The demand&apos; for women for&apos; potato liftingin Lincolnshire is lesa than last week.    A number of the women whohave been employed on this work will shortly be drafted to othercounties.    Those who have not completed their training will do so,and some will be transferred to other counties to continue thepotato harvest, while,others who are suitable for threshing will besent to Kent for that work.The demand for women tractor drivers exceeds the supply.Reports from Oxford show that the cheesemaklng classesorganised by a member of,the WomenVs County Committee, in&quot;conjunction with the Local ^Education Authorities, have made goodprogress.WomenTa Institutes,    The first Annual Meeting of the Federation ofWomen1s Institutes was held; on Thursday last.    The help whichofficial recognition.has given to the movement has been much .appreciated.  .       - ;The Federation has organised an Exhibition of VillageLife and Industries which has been open for four days, and hasbeen visited by many thousands of the public.CULTIVATION DIVISION.Tractor Scheme.    The following statement shows the position with ,regard to the provision of, tractors; machinery and implements forthe week ended 26th October, 1918:- -&apos;    ESll cottsigned Total No. withduring wSek&quot;,    counties7&quot;&quot;^Traotors...............,(59 withdrawn),      4,164.

Horse Scheme.    Owing to unforeseen military requirement/a, thearrangement to purchase a number of Nrirth Amerloan heavy horsesthe Remount Department has been cancelled.    Every effort is bemade to meet urgent demands from the counties by purchases in tlhome market.Steam Tackle. The acreage dealt with during the past week is hfollows:- Pleughed 9,400 acres, cultivated 2,539 acres, harro230 acres.    Total 12,169 acres.Harvest Work. During the week ended 26th October four additicthreshing machines have been allocated to Executive Committees,making the total number so distributed 354.SUPPLIES DIVISION.Fertilisers. The supplies of sulphate of ammonia available upthe end of November, 1918, have now been allocated- The demothowever, has been, much in excess of the supply and It has nott&apos;possible to, meet;more than about 60 per cent of the total deroThe applications In hand for the succeeding three months represa quantity almost twice as large as is likely to be available.The requirements of areas where there has been a larjincrease In allotments are being investigated with a view tosatisfactory arrangements for the adequate supply of fertilise!Seed Potatoes.    The Department have now executed the order fortons of seed potatoes for the British Expeditionary Force atSalonica.SeedrWheat. Arrangements have been made for the shipment of tquantity of seed wheat required by the British Expeditionary F*in France.Wart Disease.   Further areas Infected with wart disease have bMl   I MM. WfWH- III M-PWM   millcertified in Durham, Leicester, Westmorland, Montgomery and .Shropshire.
9 IIn Shropshire the whole of the northern part includingthe larger half of the county, has been certified as infected, butfarm lands will not be affected by this certificate until the 1stJune, 1919.4Spraying.    The Department are now reoeiving reports of the resultsof a number of experiments which have been carried out to demonstratethe value of spraying.    In almost every oase these reports affordsatisfactory evidence of the value of this operation as an insuranceagainst loss in the yield of the potato crop.Reports received during the past week indicate thatvery little blight is present&apos;in the potato crop this year exceptIn the West, and even there the number of diseased tubers is lessthan might be expected.Canadian Wonder Beans.    There Is some uncertainty in the Seed Tradeas to whether the supply of this popular variety of dwarf bean will besufficient to meet the demand during the coming season.    Arrangementsare, therefore, being made with the Royal Commission on Wheat Suppliesfor the release to the Seed Trade of a quantity of these beans whichthey have in stock.    The beans held by the Commission are of mixedquality, but it is thought that seed firms will be prepared to buyparcels and pick out the beans suitable for seed purposes.I am,Sir,     &apos;    . 1Your obedient Servant,Director-General.Rt.
