TMs Document is ,the ftrouerty of His. Britannic !iajesty*BSoYernraont.0enchinilial,um*2/254 . , 9 A 91 WAR CABIKET* 13*A.Army demobilization.Memorandum by the eeoretary of jjljgta for war.&apos;  PARY 1.Retention of men with the colour^ for servicewith Cadres and for safeguarding and handlingstores, supplies and animals, eto.At their meeting on l?th November, 1917, (w.C.274(14))the War Cabinet approved the scheme preparod &quot;by this Department forthe demobilisation of the military forces of the crown.2. The main principles of the scheme arc :-(a) Dispersal by drafts of individuals in the order ofpriority demanded by industrial requirements andnot by military units;   and(b) The gradual reduction of all units to the cadrestrength necessary for talcing charge of and bringingbade the regimental equipment, stores and animalo.3* At the termination of the war the men serving in theforces will fall into one of the three following groups(a)    Those serving on normal attestations, oarrying thornbeyond the termination of the war,(b) Those who have voluntarily enlisted during the warand were attested for the &quot;duration of the war&quot;.(c) Those serving under the Military service Acts, anddeemed to have been enlisted for &quot;the period of thowar&quot;.The numbers of thoae falling under group (a) will boinconsiderable, and the majority, if not the whole, will berequired to provide garrisons for overseas possessions.Thoso falling under groups (b) and (c) will be entitledto claim their discharge at the end or their period of Service,viz - &quot;duration of the war&quot; or ^period of the war&quot; as the case maybe.   The moaning of the term &quot;duration of the mxi(i and &quot;period ofthe war55 has been coneidei-ed by i r. justice Atkinte Committee, whohave-definitely given the opinion that these expressions and allsimilar express:ops are governed by the meaning to be attached tothe phrase &quot;t&amp;j mihe &apos;*ion of the war&quot;, and that the latter can onlymean the date when the -treaty of peace is finally binding on thebelligerent parties, iee. the date upon whioh ratifications thereofare exchanged.   The select committee of the House of commons haveconsidered Mr * justloo Atkimo committee^ c Report and they endorsethe ooioitxee1 s opinion.4, The War office Emergency Legislation committee in their:,second interim Report, pointed out that it might be possible toextend for a further period of twelve months the terms of serviceof men serving under &quot;duration of the tfar&quot; or &quot;period o  the war&quot;engagements by inv-olcLng the powers given by section 87 (l) of theArmy Act,   1** must be observed however that the Army Act vfcenpassed had not in contemplation any such situation as will ariseat the end of the present war, and it wuuld undoubtedly be amistake of policy, even were it legally defensible (which is atleast doubtful) zo attempt to extend the term of service of thesemen/
men by reliance upon a technical interpretation of the provisions of the Army Act, especially as these men have been led to believe that their term of service will cease at the end of the war.

5. On the legal point it must be noted that Mr Justice Atkin&apos;s Committee reported that the interpretation of Section 87 (1) of the Army Act was not free from doubt and they advised that, if it is desired to utilise the powers of extension given by that Section, special legislation for the purpose should be passed. The Committee also called attention to the fact that under Section 90 sub-section 2 of the Army Act, men are entitled at the end of their term of service to be discharged "with all convenient speed", and they expressed the opinion that this term related merely to the time required in making the necessary arrangements for the man&apos;s discharge, such as preparing his papers or, if he is abroad, providing transport for his return, and that it does not refer to the convenience or the inconvenience to the Military Authorities in dispensing with his service.

6. It may be possible to argue that as men are being dispersed according to national industrial requirements, those who are not required amongst the first for industrial purposes, are not being retained for military reasons but for national reasons. However this may be, it is doubtful whether Section 87 (1) of the Army Act would be any answer to a man who claims to be dispersed at the end of his term of service.

7. The retention of men for the purposes of handling wounded sick and stores, providing cadres and it may be, forces of occupation until they can be formed from men re-enlisted for the past bellum army is essentially a matter of military convenience and the provisions of Section 87 (1) of the Army Act could not be invoked by this department to defend their action in retaining men for these purposes.

8. The rate of dispersal is estimated at a maximum of 40,000 a day. The date of the ratification of the treaty of Peace can hardly even be guessed, but according to precedents and having regard to reasonable probabilities it may be taken as not earlier than between 2 and 3 months from the date of settlement of the Treaty terms, which may be taken to be the earliest date at which the release of the men could safely commence. Thus of the say, 3,600,000 British troops to be dispersed about 2,400,000 may have reached their homes before the close of the period covered by the legal interpretation of the expression "duration of the war". It is quite impossible, however, to make sure of this, and it is safer to assume that a large number will be wanting to complete the estimated total when this decisive date is reached. Moreover it is estimated that in any case the work of clearing up, safeguarding stores and bringing them home and tending the sick and wounded in military hospitals will absorb 1,200,000 of the 3,600,000 and that this number will be fully occupied in at least the first 2 months, and that afterwards transport and other facilities will not permit of its wastage at a rapid rate, and that many thousands will have to be retained in military service for months after the bulk of the armies have melted away. Thus many, -  some for a short time and some for longer up to perhaps 2 years - will have to kept after the limits set by our present statutory powers.

Further powers must therefore be provided, and the Army Council ask that special legislation may be passed for the purpose.

PART II.Recall of men to tho Colours in thoEvent of Remobilisation.9. When the schema of demobilisation was submitted to theWar Cabinet, tho Prime Minis tor issued a warning to the effect thatthe possibility of a romobilisation must not be overlooked.   It isimpossible to prcpaTo adequate plans to moot such a contingency untilit is known what powers we shall possess to secure the return to theColours of the personnel required.10o On 1st April 1913 there were only 112,705 men (includingmen in administrative Corps not liable for General foreign Serviceand also mon who were not medically fit for service abroad) in tho  ,Regular forces whoso Colour; Service had not expired^   This total willnaturally ^steadily diminish and at the end of the war the:numbersremaining&apos;with Colour Service still te fulfil will probably benegligible.11* All men will; on leaving the Dispersal Station onDemobilisation, be granted S3 days&apos; furlough, and during this period,there will be power to recall 3uch men from leave.   During the earlystages of Demobilisation the number of men on furlough at any onetime nay be as msnyas 1,120,000 as a maximum, but this number willbe a rapidly diminishing quantity, and the period during which itwould be possible to recall any substantial number of men would onlybe a small fraction of the period which must elapse before theformation of the Post Bellum Army can be oompleted.   Moreover, asOfficers do not receive the 28 days1 furlough, but each is gazettedout of the Service immediately after his dispersal, they will notbe liable to recall.   Although therefore it would be possible for ashort limited period in the early stages of demobilisation to recalla certain number of men to the Colours there would be no correspondingpower to recall any officers.12. The question of the reformation of the Post-Bcllum AXmy isone which involves careful consideration, but until the system to beaaopted in order to obtain the personnel is decided upon, we cannotproceed with the re-formation, and some oonsiderable time, must, inany case, elapse after the termination of the war before the re-formation can be completed.13. We cannot rely for the purposes of providing the necessarypersonnel for any remobilisation in the meantime,(a) either upon the Hilitary Servioe Acts, or anyextension of the terms of service thereunder or(b) upon the men whose Colour Servioa has not expiredat the termination of the war or who may, for thetime being, be on furlough, and therefore subject torecall to the Colours, or(c) upon the post Bellum A*my which can hardly beconstituted within a period of at least 2 years fromthe termination of the war.14. Therefore further powers to enable tho Army Council toreoall to the Colours all Officers and men who may be required inthe event of a reauobilisation beoomin^.. necessary, must be provided .and the Army Council ask that special legislation may be passed forthat purpose.Part III./
PAUT III.PO&apos;3RS 0? TRAgBI^ ^gmjmpG.15, A further question requires consideration in connectionwith the working of the Suhemo of Demobilisation, and pending theoreation of the Post Dollum Army the provision of foreign reliefsfor Overseas Garrisons.16, The Army (Transfers) Act 1915, pro video that &quot;for the-purposes of the present war a soldier belonging to the.RegularPorcos may, notwithstanding anything in Section 83 of the ArmyAct, be transferred vrithouG his consent to any Corps&quot;, and underito provision a considerable number of men have been botransferred.   Tho Act further provides that oo ooon as convenientafter the end of the present war, any ooldier oo transferred shallbo re-transferred if he,so desires to the Corps in which he wasserving at the time of&quot; transfer*17,&apos; It io not clear what the term &quot;so ooon ao convenient&quot;means.   In all probability it would not admit of a delay for thepurpose of sanding a man overooao for foreign reliof in the Corpofrom whieh he claimed a transfer and oompulsorily retaining himin that Corpo until it became convenient to retransfer him to Mooriginal Corpo on the formation of tho Post-Bcllum Army.18. It io estimated that at tho end of the war, between60/5 and 70^ of those who are left of the Old Regular Army will beholding Non-commissioned rank and that not more than 10?* will beavailable for foreign reliefs.   It will therefore be necessary forthe purpose of providing reliefs for Overoeao Garrisons to retainfreedom to make further compulsory transfers and to reiu&amp;esanction for re-transfers.     Such powera would also be necessaryto effect a rcmobilisation, otherwise it might be impossible tocomplete, from the men available for recall, the establishment ofany particular Unit of a Corps.19* The .Army Council asks that this Aet may be continued inforce for the purpose indicated, or that opecial legislation onthe lines of the Act should bo introduced.29th October, 1918*
