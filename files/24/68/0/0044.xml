r1\4			IT191,. ifSECRET,ft.T. 6144.      I r\ WAR CABINET..&apos;   AZBRM1JAN.Hoto by Go nor al JJ,off\ War., 0 fT p. c e.1.    When tho joint Irana-Caucasian Government broke up atthe end cf May the Tatars declared an independent republicwith its temporary carital at Elizabetopol pending the occupationof Baku.     The precise territory claimed is uncertain, but itcertainly included the provinces of Elizabetopol and Baku,prcbably the south-eastern part of that cf Erivan, and possibly 1Daghestan and Persian Azerbaijan,     These further claimo, hov/over,do not seem to have been upheld by the Tatar Delegation to theConstantinople Peace Conference, and tho Daghostanis, who areMoslems (Sunni) but net,Tatars, belcng to tho Union of Caucasianmountaineers, and appear to be divided over the question ofinclusion in Azerbaijan.     There ia no evidence as to the desiresv,f the Tatars in Persian Azerbaijan to be included in the NewState.     A notable Pan-Turanian, Rassul-Zade, President of thoAzerbaijan national Assembly and cf the delegation to Ccyiotanti-nople, appears to share with Khoioky Khan, the head of theGovernment, the chief influence in directing the policy of theNew State..     Rasoul-Zatie is the founder and leader of theHussavat party (extreme pro-Turk) and.worked at Teheran duringthe Persian revolution and therefore presumably haa numerousconnecticno with the Persian democrats.2,.     The Turks advanced into Azerbaijan towards Baku inJune 1918 and by the end of July were in occupation of moat ofthe territory of the New Republic, Germany accepted the positioncf Turkey being virtual Suzerain of Azerbaijan, but oho has neverrecognised it as a state and the &quot;Omission of any reference to itand the assignment of Baku to Russia by the Russo**Germansupplementary treaty of the 27th August caused loud protests fromthe Turks and Tatars,3.    From July onwards Nuri Bey, Enver&apos;s brother, wasestablished at j&amp;lizabetopcl with dic^efial powers and hisstringent measures seem to have been successful in restoringorder, but they occasioned great dissatisfaction among thelocal population.     At the same time he pushed on the formationand training of a Tatar Corps.     This should be noted in connectionwith certain political ambitions of Nuri&apos;s unconnected with hismilitary operation against Baku.     The successful conclusion ofthese on the 15th September gained for Azerbaijan its mostcoveted prize and the Azerbaijan Government at once movedthere from Elizabetopoi.4.     But on the 23rd September the Germans obtained fromTalaat, at Berlin, a protocol agreeing to withdraw Turkishtroops from Azerbaijan and to facilitate communicationbetween Germany and Persia.     It appears probable that Talaat insigning the above, protocol, which amounted to a completechange of Turkish policy in Azerbaijan, was making a virtuecf necessity, since he must have fully realised the militarysituation and the impending collapse of Bulgaria.     Pourdivisions are go far known to have received orders for transferto Constantinople, while a portion of the troops, which tookBaku
* 2 *paku and were under orders to clear Snzeli, had those orderscountorraandod.5.    On the other hand, a wire from Jinvor to Nuri, reportedon the 12th October oaid that it was necessary ff*r the Turks,while they wore still strong in Azerbaijan, to clear theRussians and Armenians out of that country.x    This appliodparticularly to the Lenkoran and Astara districts since itwas necessary to destroy any obstacle which might preventthe Turkish frontier from marching with those on Azerbaijan,From the foregoing and other evidence it is obvious that thoTurks intend to secure and maintain a footing in Azerbaijan,including Persian Azerbaijan,     This is also shown by theirestablishment of an independent line of communication outsidethe boundaries of tho How Armenia as rectrictod by the Turks,6,     It is further significant that Dnver&apos;0 relationsare know to bo collected in Azerbaijan, and that precautionsare being takon to select partisan officers for service there.The Turks can. scarcely expect to annex Azerbaijan during thiswar, but it seems possible, if not probable, that they intendto evacuate their regular troops while retaining a band ofEnver&apos;s adherents, who may hope to exterminate the Armeniansbefore the conclusion of peace and to cocure their pooitionon the plea of self-determination of peoples.    Further colour  &apos;is lent to this theory by the recent agreemont made by thoPersian Crown Prince at Tabriz, whereby the two Azerbaijansare to be united.7.     Tho general conclusion is that Enver&apos;3 party aspiroto secure the British evacuation of north-west Persia on theground of Persian neutrality, while themselves maintaining aparty of desperados in, tho &quot;self determined&quot; province ofAzerbaijan, which they intend to use as a jumping off pointfor Pan-Tslamic or Pan-Turanian activity eastwards in thefuture.     It is essential that this scheme should be fully&quot;realised and the dituation not overlooked at the peaco conference.In Baku itself, however, the Azerbaijan attitude appears to boconciliatory towards the Russians but to be bitterly hostileto the Armenians of whom 15,000 are reported, to have beenmassacred after the capture   of tho town.War Office,15.10.18.
