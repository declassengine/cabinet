198(THIS D.OCUMT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENTSECRET VI A R   CABINETMINISTRY&apos;OP HEALTH AMP POOR LAW.&apos;Memorandum by the Minister of Reconstruction.It I have had under consideration the further corrospondonce on ,this subject sent to Sir Maurice Hankey by Mr.&apos; Rockliff and circulatedas G.T.6&apos;126.&apos;2.        I explained in my memoranduiii of tho 5th October (G.T.5885) thatLiio agitation which Mr, Rockliff is conducting is based upon anobjection to two changes made in the draft Bill by the Homo AffairsCommittee, namely:a. the insertion of the words &quot;Local Government&quot;  -in the title jb. the deletion of a paragraph relating to thefuture administration of the Poor Law whichstood in the First Schedule.&apos;5.        So long as the War Cabinet find themselves unable to decidea. .   whether these changes are to stand&quot;; andb. whether the Bill is to be introduced,I am precluded from any public defence or explanation of the Bill,,as a Government measure.4,        If this situation is allowed to continue, the misunderstanding. *and suspicion of the proposals, sedulously fostered by Mr.-Rockliff.who does not&apos;hesitate to disclose confidential information forhis own purposes9 will swell to such dimensions that the Bill maybecome difficult to carry oven in the form in which I had securedits acceptance in April last by the bodies which I was authorised toconsult.o.        I mvst therefore again urge that the YJar- Cabinet should takean immediate decision upon the questions stated in paragraph 5 abovoj- &apos; &apos;     C.ADDISON,30il0.10.
