The main points are as follows:-(a) No solid p::otfr?sa 3a:;.. \n my opinion be made towards thoso Int.: on of oot ra 3.0 problem and in the arrangements for theabsorption of :.o.en aod women in industry until the Pledges Bill isready tor discussion with Trade Unions,    The numbers to beemployed will depend on this,(b) It is of great; importance that the problem shall be regardedprimarily as one of employment.(0) It is essential that the method of rationing raw materialsshall be considered in detail without delay in order thatconditions may be deeiJed upon which will enable every industrialestablishment to develop its full output as soon as possible.(d) An extensive publicity campaign will be necessary in orderthat the poplie may realise and assist in overcoming the inevitabledifficulties daring the transition period.(e) The large number of urgent Bills necessary for the purposesof resettlement makes it necessary to make early arrangements forthe allocation cf time for their discussion in the Boas3*   Thoserequired by che Ministry of Labour are stated in the memorandumattached,if) Schemes for fhe education and training of officers and menappear to be necessary with financial assistance from the Treasury.I hope to make proposals in this connection at an early date butI should be glad to have general approval of some system of grantsfor maintenance and training.(g) Whilfc I agree with Dr. Addison1s uropo salvor payment duringunemployment of a flat rate together with dependent&apos;s allowancesto discharged men and to civil workers, I have made other proposalswith regard to the amount of benefit.Although it appears that there will not be sufficient time in   ,which to carry through all the negotiations for the introduction ofa universal scheme of contributory unemployment insurance, I feelthat the preservation of the principle of contributory insurance isof the greatest importance,   I propose, therefore, that thescheme which has been approved by the Labour Resettlement Committeeshould be proceeded with.I entirely agree with the proposal that a Director-Generalof the civil side of demobilisation and resettlement.    The needfor such a post had already been foreseen but although I receivedsome time ago the sanction of the Chancellor of the Exchequer tothe appointment of a Second Secretary to the Ministry of Labourfor this Duroose I have been unable to fill the position as nosuitable man&apos; could be found who was not already engaged on importantwork.With reference to my memorandum G.T.6001 I would propose thatI should be given general sanction for making appointments, withinsuch limits as the Cabinet may consider to be desirable.     It isnecessary alto that immediate instructions should be given for theprovision of premises for the purposes of demobilisation.(Signed) Geo. H. Roberts.
201As the Millie tor of Reconstructions  Memorandum G.T.6Q47 dealslargely with the work which ia being dono or will fall to he doneby my Department, I shoula like to make some comments upon it.In m;y view it is of the highest importance that tho problemof the transition period should be regarded as one of Employment,and that so far aa la practicable, the policy of the Government indemobilisation and tho reconstruction of industry during theperiod immediately following tho cessation of hostilities, shouldbe framed so aa to minimise the riaks of bulk unemployment,Por this reason :: entirely agree with Dr. AdcUaon that theGovernment should be ready to incur a large expenditure in orderto meet the situation during the transition period.    Money spentin giving adequate out-of-work benefit and in training officersand men discharged from the Army in order to re-fit them for civillife would be well spent, not only as a meana of preventing unrestduring this oritical time, but alao aa a means of reatoring theproductive power of the country aa far as possible.    Assuming anarmistice of such a character ae to make the resumption of&apos;hosiJUities impossible, our first aim should be to restore industryto normal conditions as rapidly as possible, and not to continuethe unproductive manufacture of war materials simply for the sakeof creating employment.    But if this policy is adopted, it followsthat the State must be prepared to provide adequately for thosewho are thrown out of work.     I have made some oiJiticisms onDr. Addison&apos;s proposals later, in this memorandum, but with itsgeneral principles I am in aoeord.Capital and Raw Materials. I also agree with him that it isvery desirable to relax &quot;the restrictions on new iusues of capitalas soon as possible, but I would point out that tho w^ole employ-nent situation must largely depend on th* steps taken to deal withthe questions of raw material and oxport.    With regard to theformer, I think that the Government must lay down the generalprinciple that the allocation and distribution of raw materialsmust be determined with a view to creating the maximum amount ofemployment.    From this it appears to follow that the StandingCouncil on Raw Materials will have to attach certain conditionsin making bulk allocation to the different&apos; industries.   It isessential to prevent the larger firms obtaining more than theirfair share of raw materials, but if tree competition for theavailable supply is permitted, this result will be inevitable.It appearsi therefore, that the question will have to be consideredwhether the fixation of a price and the insistence on an equaldistribution throughout each industry will not bo necessaryconditions on which the Standing Council should, insist.    Thereis also the question whether the smaller   firms will be able torisk undertaking manufacture to the full extent of their establish-ments unless they are given some assistance   by the State.   In thegeneral uncertainty which is bound to prevail for some time afterthe War, firms of small capital may not be willing to manufacturefor a speculative market, especially as prices may be falling, butit is essential that every establishment should be encouraged todevelop its full output as soon as possible if the employmentproblem is to be solved.    I would, therefore, suggest that thisquestion also requires immediate consideration.There is tho further question of restrictions on exports andimports.    There is likely to be a very strong demand from foreigncountries for certain semi-raanufactured articles such as tops andyarns at prices higher than,those obtainable in the home Market.If free export is allowed, it is possible that there would not bea sufficient supply ef these; articles for the home industries/ which1.
9 n 7fj y wwhich depend on then as raw materials.     If this were to happenthe amount of employment would bo considerably restricted,   itsrelation to the improvement^of foreign exchange involves con-siderations of Government policy, about which I am not competentto judge.     I presume, howevor, that this question has been thesubject of careful consideration by the Ministry of Recon-struction and the Board of Trade, but I would point out thatit is a vital aspect of the employment problem, which is theprimary question for the whole transition period if the civilpopulation is to be maintained in a state of contentment andserious industrial troubles are to be avoided.Public Opinion,   I heartily agree with Dr. Addison in theneed for an extensive propaganda in order to acquaint the publicof the difficulties which confront the Government in dealing withthe transition period.     I ,have delivered a number of spoecheson the subject both here and in Franco in the past year, and my &apos;experience convinces me of theneed for and the value of suchpropaganda.    Without it the whole position meifhe so prejudicedby ill-informed criticism in the Press, of which there are alreadysigns.    Unless the inherent difficulties of the problem arecarefully and repeatedly explained, an outcry will at once beraised when the inevitable unemployment commences that theGovernment has made no plans to deal with the situation, whicheverybody saw was bound to rise.    The sooner steps can be talcento deal with the matter the better.Parliamentary Programme. I should like further to drawimmediate attention, however, to the serious position likely toresult through the great congestion which is arising as regards.Parliamentary business..   For the purposes of Resettlement it willhe necessary to introduce at an early date:(a) The War Pledges Bill(b) Tho out-of-work Donation Bill for Soldiersfo) A Bill to deal with Apprenticeship interruptedby ^&quot;ar Service.In addition, a scheme of universal contributory unemploymentinsurance has been worked out by the Labour Resettlement Committeeand if such a scheme is to be carried into effect it in esoontialthat it should be laid before Parliament at the earliest possiblemoment.    Unless this is done simultaneously with the pcymi^it ofthe free out-of-work donation, which will be rendered no(^iWiu?yif peace comes within the next few months, any hopo of applyinga general contributory scheme to the oountry is likely to bodestroyed.    It is possible also that additional power,? will berequired by this Ministry in connection with resettlement,l^urther, a Bill will be required for dealing with grains in aidof re-education of officers and I am considering in contractionwith the llinistry of Pensions a scheme for reserving certain    ^occupations foi dfcf-abled men which will require legislation;   Allthese measures will be of an urgent character, and no doubt otherDepartments have other legislation equally urgent which they     ,desire to bring before Parliament.     I think the whole legislativeprogrammo should be immediately reviewed in the fright of theParliamentary situation and some definite arrangements made as tothe allocation of time for the various measures necessary fordealing with the transition period.On the details of Dr. Addison&apos;,8 proposal I will contentmyself at this juncture with exuresjsing my approval of theappointment of a Director General of Demobilisation, and hopethat the appointment will be made forthwith.    I can then/ discuss2.
h u *jdiscuss with that officer and tho Ministers concerned .the detailsof administration, policy, provision of adequate staff, premises,etc.     I feel that it will be necessary for the Treasury to givegeneral sanction, within limits, in resoect,,of the financialarrangements for staff, etc., which after a careful review of theposition may be considered to be necessary.On two of the main problems mentioned in Dr. Ad&apos;Uson&apos;smemorandum, Officers Resettlement and Unemployment Insurance Iattach the following comments:LJ^ii^tvt^^ent. The Officers&apos; Resettlement Committeehas been examining&quot;&quot;thisquestion and arrangements have been madefor dealing with the demobilisation of offioers on the same linesas men.    The problem of employment is, however, likely to bemore difficult in tho case of the former, because large numbers ofthem went into the Army straight from school and have no pro-fessional qualifiNations, whereas a further large proportion havebeen promoted from the ranks and have established a claim to abetter position which it is impossible to ignore.    The experienceof the Appointments Department&quot;of the Ministry of Labour has alreadyshewn conclusively the vital importance of re-education, ifsuitable employment is to be found for the ex-officers with whoawe shall have to deal on demobilisation.    The Officers&apos; TrainingCommittee have already recora landed t?aat immediate steps shouldbe taken to obtain facilities for giving training to those whoare now being discharged as unfit for further service.     I hopeshortly to put forward, proposals for dealing with this matter inconjunction with the Minister of Pensions.    The Committee ari,however, also considering a wider scheme for offering educationalfacilities to all officers and men of like standing who need themand who are likely to benefit by them on demobilisation.    Thisscheme will have to be administered by the Ministry of Labour, theBoard of Education and the Ministry of Pensions in close co-opera-tion, but I do not think that it will be sufficient to give theBoard of Education the power of defraying fees, cost of maintenance,etc., as a great deal of the training that will have to be givenwill not be of an institutional character.    This, however, is oneof the questions which is being examined by the Training Committee,whose proposals will be submitted in due course.     I should,therefore, be glad of the Cabinet&apos;s general approval of somesystem of grants and maintenance with a view to fitting officersand men of like standing for employment on discharge.I am not sure whether it will be desirable to allow officersshort leave for the -purpose of interviewing possible employersunless it can- be shewn that their application is seriously madeand is likely to have practical results.    Before agreeing tothis proposal   I should like to consult fcbe War Office on thesubject.     I should add, however, that the Appointments Depart-ment is sending an officer to every Army abroad and every Commandat home to co-operate with the Education Officers in advisingOfficers and professional men as to their prospects of trainingand employment on discharge.    It is also proposed to form Boardsat the Front during demobilisation who will interview officers andassist them in finding employment.    A complete survey of all theprincipal professions and educational institutions has also beenprepared by the Appointments Department which is about to bewidely distributed at the Front, in hospitals, etc    By thismeans officers will be able to oompare the prospects offered andobtain all further particulars which they require from the Depart-ment,    As regards the scheme prepared by the Military ServiceCivil Liabilities Department of the Local Government Board, I havenot had the advantage, of seeing this Report, and should be gladto have an early opportunity of doing so, as it is likely tohave considerable bearing on our work in re-settling officers.3, / Local
Local Advisory 0orgm 111eea. These Committees will, in nyopinion, play a most&quot; important part in resettlement and it will benecessary to afford them all the assistance they may need for theworlc which they have been asked to carry out.    in this connectionI attach a copy of a memorandum which has been circulated to theCommittees on the recommendation of the Labour ResettlementCommittee.    It is of course possible that tho proposals inrespect of Civil workers may have to be modified if an earlycessation of war production becomes practicable,TOfriPIQYMSHT Draff IT.Dr. Addlson&apos;8 proposals under this head provide free unemploy-ment benefit as follows;-(a) To munition workers, 30/- per week of unemployment as v/ellas an allowance for dependent children, during the first fourweeks after discharge.(b) To discharged sailors and soldiers, 20/- per week of unemploy-ment (not exceeding 20 weeks in all) as well as an allowance fordependent children, during the year after discharge, in additionto full pay and allowances for 4 weeks furlough after releasefrom their units.(c) ffo &quot;mobile&quot; nombers of the women&apos;a corps, - the same as fordemobilised sailors and soldiers, except that the flat rate willbe 16/8 instead of 20/-.fd) To tho whole ocoupied population, except so far as alreadyoofcerel by (a), (b) and fc), 20/- in the case of men and 16/0in the case of women per week of unemployment (not exceeding 10weeks in all), as well as an allowance for dependent children,during the 6 months following the commencement of an armistice,the period of 6 months to be extended if necessary.I see the strongest objection to the first of these proposals,namely, that for paying 30/- a week to discharged munitionworkers. ,   It requires, for its practical working, a definitionof the torn &quot;munition worker&quot;, and no definition exists or can beinvented which would not be exceedingly difficult to apply, andwould not give rise to very great anomalies.    T?ven if thisdifficulty can be overcome, I doubt whether it is sound inprinciple to differentiate in this respect in favour of &quot;munitionworkers&quot;, and any attempt at such differentiation would not inmy opinion survive the criticism to which it would be exposed.The proposal further involves very serious administrativedifficulties of detail which would make it very hard to work,e.g. it would make it necessary to define in the case of each ,claim to benefit by a munition worker the precise date at whichhe or she was regarded as having been discharged from munition worlp,and this date night, of course, fall at any time during tho 6months for which the scheme is to operate.    The result would bethat through that period some munition workers would be gettingSO/&apos;- and others 20/- in respect of the same periods of unemploy-ment, although both would be on an equal footing as regards costof living and the prospect of getting employment.For these reasons I am certain that the 30/-, if given at all,would have to be given to the whole occupied population and couldnot be confined to munition workers.    The question then becomesone of deciding whether 50/- ohouM be paid to everybody duringthe first 4 weeks of unemployment after discharge, and is to befollowed by a rate of 20/- as is proposed.    The answer to this4./ must
must, I think, be in the negative.     Apart from the patont impose!-bility of defining the &quot;date of discharge&quot; and the administrativecomplications that would be caused by the change in the rate ofbenefit after a period, tho rate of 30/-, if onee adopted forthe initial period, could not be reduced subsequently to 20/-,and the not effect would bo to substitute the former figure fortho latter as the flat rate of unemployment benefit for the wholeperiod.     I think that this is very undesirable, and suggest .thatif some special payment to the discharged munition work&quot;isconsidered to be necessary, it should be provided by giving suchworkers the right to a fortnight&apos;s notice&apos;, (or if necessary aneven longer period) or&apos; payment in lieu of notice.    .Such paymentwould be made in a lump sum to the worker on discharge, and. wouldbe much the most satisfactory way of dealing with this point.I am in agreement with tho proposals so far as they relate todischarged sailors and soldiers and &quot;mobile&quot; members of thewomen&apos;s corps.     I had felt some doubt whether the dependents1allowanoe ought to be granted in the case of women, because tifthe effect which this might have on the unemployment benefit forcivil war workers, but inasmuch as it is now proposed to give theallowance in the case of the latter also, it is clear that   themembers of the women1s corps should not be excluded.As regards the proposals in the case of workers otherth n discharged sailors and soldiers, and mobile members of thowomen&apos;s corps, I tfcink that the Cabinet, before agreeing to a freegrant of unemployment benefit, should weigh very carefully theconsequence which this may entail.    There is now in operation acontributory scheme of unemployment insuranoe covering nearly4 million workpeople and I have under consideration definiteproposals which have been approved by the Labour ResettlementCommittee, for a tomporary extonsion of this scheme, so as to makeit uf universal application with a substantial increase in therate of benefit during,the period of resettlement, say:for aperiod of 5 years..   It is no easy matter to formulate such a.scheme and to secure for it the general acceptance among industrialorganisations which is essential if;it is to&quot; have a chance ofadoption, and some timo oust elapse before I shall be in aposition either to put before the Cabinet definite proposals fora universal contributory scheme, or to say that such a scheme itsimpracticable.     I think, however, that it&apos;would be a groat mis-fortune if, pending consideration of a contributory scheme, anystep were taken which made it impossible ever, to re-establishunemployment insurance on a. contributory basis.     In my opinionthe principle of direct contribution by the workpeople to thecost of benefit is a sound one because it preserves the idea ofself-help and afoids the danger of sapping the self-respect Ofthe workers by means of free grants out of State moneys.$here is the further consideration which I consider tobe%a,n important one, that if the benefit is given free, itmust be administered ontirely by State machinery, or at any rate,the possibility of administration through industrial organisationmust be severely limited.     Such a scheme would have to beadministered in accordance with general rules of universal appli-cation and the great advantage of elasticity and adaptation tothe needs ofparticular trades would be,entirely or almostentirely lost.;&apos;&quot;&apos; - ;&apos; -- *    - ,It must be remembered also that there is in existence thecontributory scheme already referred to, covering nearly 4million workpeople, and with an accumulated baiance in hand of 15,.000,000.     If a free grant is, introduced without some; pre-cautions being taken to facilitate a subsequent reversion to a/ contributory5.
Icontributory scheme, a serious problem will be created aa tothe method of disposal of these accumulated funds.I regard the preservation of the principle of contributory(insurance as of the greatest importance/    A non-contributoryscheme should only be resorted to if it is found impopiible tosot a contributory scheme on foot within the time available forthe purpose.    While, therefore, it may be necessary in oa$arto meet an emergenoy necessitating the immediate payment ofbenefit, to Bet up a non-contributory scheme, I am of opinionthat steps should be taken to press on with the extended schemeon a contributory basis which has been formulated..     Iflegislative sanction could be obtained to this, and the necessarymachinery got into potion before   an armistice or peaco arrived,it would still be possible to start that scheme on the under-standing that, if necessary, the contribution from the Statowould be increased to whatever extent was necessary to financeit during the period of resettlement.Prom the same point of view the proposals with regard to therate, of benefit under the free scheme ought to be examined intho light of their probable effect on a contributory scheme.It is unlikely that a contributory scheme could provide a rate .of benefit as high as ZOJ- a week, together with an allowancefor dependants, unless the contribution from the Treasury is  -much higher than anything hitherto proposed.     I may say that :the proposals at present under consideration as regards theextended contributory scheme provide for a payment of 15/- aweek in the oase of men and 12/6 in tho case of women withoutin either case a dependant1s allowance.    The question iswhether, if a free grant of 20/- a week together with adependants1 allowance, is made, a proposal to revert subsequentlyto a lower rate of benefit under a contributory scheme wouldstand a chance of adoption.     I am not prepared to advocate alower rate of benefit&apos;than that now suggested by Dr. Addison,having regard to the present cost of living, and I am inclinedto think that a higher minimum rate nay have to be adopted forthe free scheme.     In this oase the consequence as regards acontributory scheme must be taken and it may be that unless thereis a substantial reduction in the cost of living, the Statecontribution will have to be largely increased.There are a few points of detail in the free scheme whichI wish to mention in order that a definite decision may beobtained;   these points relate to all forms of the proposals quoteabove under (a) (b) (c) and (&amp;);-1. It is not clear whether it is intended that the paymentof benefit should be subject to a &quot;waiting week&quot; or whether itIs proposed that benefit should be payable for every day ofunemployment.     It is obvious of course that the latter altera-tion would greatly increase the cost of the scheme and wouldinvolve payment for every day of casual unemployment.2. Under the existing scheme of State Unemployment insuranceassociations of workpeople are allowed, if they so desire, topay their members the unemployment benefit that falls due tot&amp;eni, and to claim the amount back from the Department.   One ofthe conditions on which they are allowed to do this is that theyshould add to the State benefit a sum out of their own fundsamounting to net less than one third of the State benefit^ Thereason of this condition is that the Associations should not he,merely paying over the money provided under the scheme,&apos; but&apos;should add something of their own, and should thus have a directincentive not to pay the money if the worker is not properlyentitled to it.     Under the free scheme there is no suggestion&apos;    &quot; / that6..
that the Trade Unions should be asked to add any money of theirown to the State grant.     On the contrary Dr. Adiison definitelyrecommends that they should be requested not to pay unenploy-spent benefit to their members.     The safeguard described willtherefore not exist under the proposals now in question,There is tho further consideration that the arrangementsifliioh have to be made for enabling trade unions to pay benefitto their membors in this way necessarily in/olve considerablecomplication, and so far from reducing the total amount of7/ork falling on the Ministry of Labour in the administration ofbenefit increase this total,   The difficulties of the Depart-ment would be multiplied if Trade Unions whoso officials havehitherto had no experience in the working of these arrange-Bjonts, or possibly indeed in the payment of unemploymentbenefit at all, were allowed to make them and to learn thework during the period when the officials of the Departmentwould already be -hardpreesed with other work of every desorip-tion.I regard it as essential therefore that arrangements forthe payment of the free grant by Trade Unions should not bepermitted under the free scheme.because, in practice, benefit must he calculated on the&apos;number of days of unemployment, and. the weekly rate musttherefore be divisible by six.4, The proposals put forward by Dr. Addison do not appearto contain a definite statement with regard to the minimumage at which a person becomes entitled to the free grant inhis own right, or the maximum age of.children in respect ofwhom an allowance may be added.     I understand, however, thatas regards children, the maximum age previously contemplated,was 14, whilst it is clear that the free grant could hardlybe paid in respect of a worker in his own right under the age,at any rate, of 16*    I may mention that under the existingcontributory scheme, full benefit does not become payable voit^.the age of 18, and half benefit is paid between the age of lfr!and 18 and no benefit under tho age of 17, the age at whichcontributions become first payable being 16.I think it is clear that there ought to be no gap betweenthe maximum age at which allowances arc payable in respect ofohildren, and the minimum age at which the free grant becomes.payablo to a worker in his own right.    In the case of Armyseparation allowances the full rate is paid up to the age of 14,and reduced rates between the ages of 14 and 16.    I am anxiousto avoid the administrative complication of a reduced rate ofdependants&apos; allowance where the&quot;dependants are above the&apos;   ,Specified age.    What I would suggest, therefore, is that thedependants&apos; allowance at a uniform rate should be paid up to theage of 16, that between the ages of 16 and 18 a flat rate ofbenefit at half the rate for a^ufts should be paid, and thatthe full adult rate, should begin &apos;to be payable at the age of18,St It is necessary to havdaily rate of benefit7.
MINISTRY OF LABOUR,EMPLOYMENT DEPARTMENT.LOCAL ADVISORY COMMITTEES.^^^^^Jnctions of local advisory committees in connectionwith resettlement.&apos;OTE. The memorandum printed below has been prepared by theSub-Committee set up by the Labour Llesettlement Committee toconsider and advise upon the functions of Local AdvisoryCommittees in connection with resettlement. The proposalscontained in this memorandum have been approved by theMinister of Labour.It will be observed that the proposals contained in thememorandum involve the fullest recognition of Local AdvisoryCommittees as the, responsible local bodies for dealing with theresettlement of labour. The Minister is confident that lie. can relyupon all Local Advisory Committees for the efficient discharge ofthe heavy responsibilities with which they are thus entrusted, jINTRODUCTION.The following memorandum is intended to furnish a general indicationthe functions of Local Advisory Committees in connection with re-jllement.   It contains :-I.-(i) An outline of the scheme that has been suggested in con-nection with the demobilisation of the Forces,(ii) An outline of the scheme that has been suggested in con-nection with the discharge of civil war workers!II. An indication of the preliminary work to be undertaken byLocal Advisory Committees before demobilisation,HI. An indication of the work of these Committees during de-mobilisation.-(i) OUTLINE OF SCHEME IN CONNECTION WITHDEMOBILISATION OF THE FORCES.The following is an outline of the scheme in connection with theIiobilisation of the Forces suggested by the Departmental CommitteeDemobilisation Procedure.(A) The soldier fills up a registration form-preferably, two or threemonths before he is likely to-be demobilised. This form is sentto the Claims and Record Office of the Employment Depart-ment at Kew.
(B) At Kew it is classified and sent to the Local Office ofEmployment Department (either an Employment Exchangea Local Agency) for the area in which the man intends to resafter demobilisation.(C) At the Local Office arrangements are made, as far as possilto find suitable employment for the man, either by wayreinstating him with his previous employer or otherwise, y-*this connection all possible use will be made of any organisalij -which may be available for the purpose in the industry tothe man belongs, e.g., Employers&apos; Associations, Trade Uniofetc.(I)) When a definite offer of employment is obtained, the maname will be reported to his Commanding Officer with a reqiiion a slip attached to his registration form for his early release,(E) In preparing drafts for release, Commanding Officers willpreference to those men (hereafter referred to as &quot; Slip menwho have definite promises of immediate engagement.   If tlijare either not enough or too many &quot; Slip men,&quot; preferencebe given to others or to them (as the case may. be) accordingthe urgency from the national point of view of the requiremojof their trades; a limited preference ma)- also be givenmarried men and men with long service.(K) When men without &quot;Slips&quot; return, it will be lor the LoJAdvisory Committee to endeavour to obtain employmentthem within the month&apos;s furlough that will be granted to theml(()) The men will be handed (probably at the time of discharjjfree Unemployment Insurance policies, valid for one year fro[the date of their discharge.(ii) OUTLINE OF SCHEME IN CONNECTION WITHDISCHARGE OF CIVIL WAR WORKERS.The following is an outline of the scheme in connection with 1discharge of civil war workers from armament firms suggested by the CiijWar Workers&apos; Committee.(A) As soon as the discharge of civil war workers from armameifirms is decided on, registration forms will be sent to these finfor distribution among their employees proposed to Idischarged. Those employees who desire assistance inreturniito their former employment or finding fresh employment will!up the form and dispatch it to the local Employment ExcHatyof the Employment Department.(B) The forms so received will be sorted by the officers of IkExchanges, and letters will be sent by ,the&apos; Local AdviswCommittees to employers enclosing, for completion and reludjBSStii\dipaiouret

In thisconnection all possible use will be made of any organisationwhich may be available for the purpose in the industry to whichthe worker belongs, eg., Employers&apos; Associations, TradeUnions, etc.(E) It will be for the Local Advisory Committee to endeavour toobtain this employment within the period of discharge notice orfor which wages are paid in lieu of such notice,scheme approximating to the above is under consideration inconnection with civil war workers discharged from firms otherthan armament firms.II.-W0RK PREPARATORY TO DEMOBILISATION.uring the time of demobilisation the Local Advisory CommitteesEmployment Exchanges will be working at great pressure. It isjlial, therefore, that before demobilisation begins each Localsory Committee should -A\.

It is clearly undesirable that the Local Advisory Committeeshouldattempt to duplicate the work already being done elsewhere, and the;meet
Jill accordingly be informed in advance of the headings under which il isIceped to supply them with information.   In these cases they should; er their own enquiries until they are in possession of the informationI lected elsewhere which will be placed at their disposal, it is, ofifenrse, not suggested that in all cases it will be necessary lor the Com-ILhjtee to make special enquiries in order to obtain sufficient information]ie kind indicated or even that it will invariably be necessary for aiWicular committee to be in possession of all the information outlined.vc It is realised, too, that much of the information, if obtained suffiI illy in advance of demobilisation to be of value, will necessarily haveHoitpc of a speculative nature.   It will, accordingly, be very necessary forboi information collected by the Local Advisory Committees in theif (r future to be constantly reviewed, and committees should carefullyII tfcsider the extent to which it is desirable that information should beII anected forthwith or asked for at a later date.   In this connection theybear in mind the undesirability of worrying employers and others.? \ suh duplicate enquiries.mm In cases where Local Advisory Committees themselves collectInformation (e.g., from employers, employers&apos; associations, trade unions,ewe), it will be for the consideration of the Committees as to whether theybelt most likely to obtain useful information by postal circularisatiori, by:,&apos;jrl Ii circularisalion supplemented by personal calls, or by personal callsB   lie, the necessary staff for collecting the information in any case beingmrjvidcd for this purpose.   Special attention is, however, directed to thersoressily for information, collected by whatever means, to be in the formate definite answers to definite questions if il is to be of any real value.i information finally obtained by Committees will have to be classifiedil : uitable form.Bert.!h)    \The Employment Exchange and Its Machinery.111 (Thc Committees will need to take such action as may be possibleU   a view to perfecting the existing machinery for placing workpeople in^ll^l*loynient,. particularly those who have no definite employment to whichif   bturn and have difficulty in finding suitable work.   Lor this purposeI; suggested that they should m Loi (a) get into touch, where this has not already been done, withft p (i) Employers and Employers&apos; Associations ;Bselv (ii) Trade Unions;jossi (iii) War&apos; Pensions Committees ; andlly, I (iv) Local Technical Advisory Committees (disabled sailors(j), ( and soldiers),Be oil with a view to securing their confidence and co-operation. TheBquirij     work of the Local Advisory Committees and the Eniploymentuppli Exchanges during demobilisation will undoubtedly be muchifmitu facilitated if arrangements can be made to secure that employerstifnd tli     invariably notify their labour requirements of all kinds to the
r.noExchanges and also keep the Exchanges informed as theirrequirements are satisfied. It is thought to be of great import-ance that Local Advisory Committees should make all possibleuse of existing industrial machinery. Where men are placed bjunofficial organisations it is most desirable that the Local Advisor)Committees should take steps to secure that particulars of all menso placed are notified to them; Ji consider the manner in which the present arrangements for dealingwith men and women at Exchanges can be modified or extendedto meet the probable great increase in the number of cases to Udealt with;&apos; make arrangements for appointing for each of the larger and well-I jjorganised industries in the locality, e.g., the building trade, thcltllengineering trade, the mining industry, etc., when this is desired! Fra &quot;Trade Sub-Committee&quot; which would undertake work in connection with finding employment for men and women in tinindustry concerned and a general Sub-Committee which mightundertake similar functions to those of the Trade Sub-Committee.;in respect of the smaller and less organised industries of the!locality.regards the appointment of these Trade Sub-Committees in thilvajlarger and well-organised industries, the following procedure iJ wi&apos;suggested:- Ico(i) In some cases there may already be in existence a local bodj&apos;^which is recognised as representative of employers and work!people in the industry in question. This may, for instance, bethe District&apos;Council of the appropriate joint Standing Industria1Council or the Local Technical Advisory Committee (Disable?Sailors and Soldiers) for the industry concerned. Where thisis so, the Local Advisory Committee should approach tinexisting body in order to ascertain whether they would be willinjto nominate members for the Trade Sub-Committee. Themembers of the-main Committee representing&apos;the industry inquestion should also be members of the Trade Sub-CommitteeEmployers and workpeople should be equal in number.(ii) If there is no such body in existence for a particulaiindustry the Local Advisory Committee would proceed]to appoint a Sub-Committee consisting of the members orthe main Committee representing the industry in questioitogether with a limited number of further representativenominated by the local industrial organisations concernedLhe representatives of employers and workpeople being equain number,(iii) In cases where a District Council of a Joint Standing Industrial Council is appointed subsequently to the formation tothe Local Advisory Committee of a Trade Sub-Committe)iiprd
211for the particular industry, it would he desirable for the LocalAdvisory Committee to consider whether any consequentialalteration in the composition of the Trade Hub-Committee isnecessary ;(d) consider the desirability of appointing Sub-Committees to theLocal Advisory Committee to advise and assist Local Agentsserving outlying parts of the Committee&apos;s area in connection withair      their work during the period of resettlement.l0 i Unemployment.The information as to the openings for employment obtained by theweeal Advisory Committee will incidentally give them information as tot! probable extent of unemployment during the process of resettlement,siremi this point of view they should consider (as regards all workpeople. co only as regards demobilised sailors and soldiers)11(a) in what trades and occupations there is likely to be unemploy-mi&amp; ment on demobilisation, and for what period it is likely to last ;ntte (D-) whaf; steps should be taken to deal with this unemployment.The Local Advisory Committees will be concerned primarily withiging men and women needing employment into touch with existingin tlancies. The creation of work or employment will probably not comelire tiin their province, but they will undoubtedly be in a good position tofer with and advise the responsible authorities in the locality as to(h the probable position with regard to unemployment and the stepsch should be taken to deal with it.bo&apos;worice, Ifust. HI.-WORK DURING DEMOBILISATION.ni tl During demobilisation the work of Local Advisory Committees willi Ijbably fall under the following heads : willii (a) Giving assistance in determining the priority of discharge fromTl     the Navy and Army, e.g., finding out for what men employmentistry I     is waiting.imitte (b) Seeing that, where necessary, employment is found for men andwomen needing employment (including demobilised men, dis-irticul charged civil war workers, displaced substitutes, etc.). Whereverjiroce! possible, it is desirable that men and women should havehers i * employment ready for them as soon as they leave the Forces orluestil     their war employment.iitatiyi (c) Investigating and dealing with complaints made against theicerne1 Exchanges it being understood that the investigation of suchig equ complaints should be transferred to the Ministry of Labour ifand when it appears that they are likely to involve&apos; disciplinaryg Indii action in respect of an officer of the Department,ition i (d) Generally keeping a watch over the work of the Exchanges and[rnrnittj     helping that work in any way possible!
(c) Considering differences arising in individual cases, and endeavouring to secure a settlement (where there is no machinerjalready available in the industries concerned, e.g., ConciliationHoards, District Councils of Joint Standing Industrial Councils&apos;* tetc.), with regard to questions of (i) reinstatement in former employment,(ii) the fair rate of wages for disabled men, mm(Questions with regard to the lair rate of wages for disnlflf^imen will fall within the province of the joint Sub-Coinmili&apos;;/of the Local Advisory Committee and the  Local  Wal &apos;Pensions Committees where such a Joint Sub-Committecl&apos; 1has been appointed.)(f) Investigating, where necessary, the status of apprentices, learners^land others who were called up for His Majesty&apos;s Service beforN^fthe completion of their training,(g) Making or suggesting arrangements for transferring men amwomen for whom employment cannot be found at their norma    &apos;occupation to some other suitable occupation or industry.(h) Reporting periodically on the state of employment and unemplojment, and, where necessary, making proposals for dealing willthe latter.It is thought that much of this work would be undertaken by the Tradl jSub-Committees, of which the appointment has been suggested.It is, of course, not proposed that Advisory Committees or their Suta  jCommittees should undertake the ordinary routine work of the Employ!ment Exchanges.   The functions of a Trade Sub-Committee would liivery largely to give the Exchanges general advice and guidance on matterl;&quot;&apos;\relating to the industry which they represent   In certain cases a TradSub-Committee may wish to undertake a considerable part of the actualwork of placing&apos; men in employment, whilst in others it will prefer t*confine itself to cases of special difficulty.  The precise method of prcedure may well vary according to the special circumstances of the tradand locality, and may be left for settlement locally under the co-ordinatiitauthority of the Local Advisory Committee.
