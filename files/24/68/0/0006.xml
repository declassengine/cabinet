&apos; OfhO.    Jtf*JL......-oPolitical Intelligence Department,Confidential.Foreign Office.25 October, 1918.6*06THE GROWING DANGER OP BOLSHEVISM IN RUSSIA.Military events in France, followed by the German peace offer,have for the moment completely overshadowed the,politicalsituation in Russia,     It is, however, the course of events inGermany which is now making the Russian problem one of supreme andurgent importance.Bolshevism is still supreme in Russia proper.    During thelast few months it Is only the armed forces of Germany and thefear of Germany that has kept it within bounds.     The weakeningof Germany&apos;s power will therefore mean the strengthening of thepower of the Bolsheviks, and   in proportion as Germany withdrawsher troops from the East, Bolshevism will spread Westwards.There is no doubt that as soon as German tro^ops are withdrawn fromthe Ukraine the only power that can take their place is that of theBolsheviks, and the spread of Bolshevism through the Ukraine willmean a very substantial Increase to their power in Russia.     Thesame is true of all the other border States of Russia, IncludingPoland, and the upper and middle classes cannot fail to look v/ithgrave alarm at the withdrawal of the German   troops from theoccupied territories in the East of Europe.As the military power of Germany is being gradually crushedGermany ceases to be the greatest danger to European civilisation,while a new danger, - no less deadly - looms up in the near future.That danger is Bolshevism with its doctrine of irreconcilableclass war.     And the Bolsheviks In Russia are fully aware of thepossibilities of the present situation.     On October 7 the Russianwiislless published a long letter addressed by Lenin to the CentralExecutive Committee of the Soviet in which he announced the comingrevolution in Germany and urged that Immediate preparations shouldbe made for supporting the workers in Germany and Austria-Hungary.
The Soviet Government, he said, had heen waiting many wearymonths for-.1 -:uch a development and must make the most, of itsopportunities.     It is Impossible to bay to what extent Bolshevismhas already made progress in Germany, but there can be littledoubt that the Bolsheviks will now make a supreme effort to givethe discontent In Germany an extreme socialist form.    An English-man recently returned from Russia told the writer that in con-versation with the Moscow correspondent of the Berliner Tageblattthe latter had expressed grave alarm at the growth of Bolshevismin Germany and had added that it was only the iron discipline ofthe German army that made the position safe.     If there is anytruth in this estimate of the situation it is not unnatural thatthe Bolsheviks should now be congratulating themselves on beingin a stronger position at the present moment than at any timepreviously during their regime.If peace is now within sight the position of the Bolsheviksin Russia may give rise to extremely unpleasant complications.So long as Russia is ruled by the Bolsheviks Russia will not beable to enter a League of Nations; and without Russia any suchleague would be inadequate.     The first duty of the League wouldbe to settle the Russian problem and to declare war on theBolsheviks,     This might mean that Germany would offer her servicetogether with the Allies in crushing Bolshevism as the commonenemy, and owing to her geographical position it would be Germanythat could render the most efficient help;     If Germany wereallowed to carry out such a work in the name of civilisation shewould earn the gratitude of all Russians who would thua  toedelivered from the nightmare of Bolshevism.      And in the eyes ofRussians it v-ould be Germany-, not the Allies; who had saved them.There thus seem to be two dangers ahead as a result of therule of the Bolsheviks in Russia:-   (l) in the event of the
continuance of the war and the intensification of the unrest inGermany, Bolshevism may spread, first to the Russian border pro-vinces and then to the Central Powers-, this becoming a foroe thatwould seriously threaten Europe.   (2) In the event of an earlypeace common action against the-Bolsheviks would become necessary,and Germany, if she were allowed to join in this action, mightregain much of her former position in Russia which- she has now lost.All this points to the urgency of an immediate settlement ofthe Russian problem by the Allies before the general peace settle-ment.    The longer Bolshevism is left the more dangerous it becomes.If it is dealt with now a comparatively small army from the Uralsmight advance on Moscow and put it dewn by force, whereas ifdecisive action is postponed it may spread further T;est and thetask will become much more difficult and will require a largearmy.There is already an All-Russian Government in Siberia whichhas recently come into existence as the result of the Conference&apos;at Ufa in September.     This Conference was attended by reprcsent-atives of all the existing anti-Bolshevik Governments in Russian   .territory, viz. Archangel, Samara and Omsk,, and by representativesof the Zemstvos, the old Constituent Assembly and other popularlyelected bodies.    The result of the Conference was the election ofa directorate of five men, Avksentyev, President (Social Revolution-ary); Chaikovski (Social Revolutionary), Astrov (Cadet), Vologodski(Cadet) and General Boldyryov.     The directorate of 5 have beenauthorised to control and co-ordinate the work of the variousGovernments in those districts liberated from the Bolsheviks andhave declared themselves to be an All-Russian Government, and assuch they are anxious to reoeive recognition from the Alliedt    Q -Governments. .In view of the present situation recognition of this Governmentby the Allies would enormously strengthen its position and would
9 9ocreate a profound impression in Russia in spite of thedenunciations of the Bolsheviks.     If recognition were followed byfinancial support the representatives of the new Government InAllied and Neutral countries would be in a position to formefficient intelligence bureaux in the different capitals ofEurope and America and supply tho public in these countries withfull and reliable news about tho real situation in Russia.If Bolshevism really threatens to become the most deadly enemy ofEuropean civilisation It is most important that its evil worksin the main centre of its influence should be es^^jjsed tothe world.   Not only is it an urgent task that the regime of theBolsheviks In Ri&amp; sia should be overthrown, but that its dangerousinfluence in other countries should be extirpated not bytheoretical arguments but by shedding full light upon thedisastrous results of such a policy of tyranny and violence.
