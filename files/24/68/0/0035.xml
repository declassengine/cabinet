The presentPortion of Shipping and Stocks, and II A brief account ofiwttto; e^orte, wtranoea and clearances, shipping losses,emolument of ships and new construction in the last monthfor which figures are available.Board of Trade,29th October, 1918.A.H. STANLEY,I.   THE $mm POSITION OF DIPPING AND STOCKS.The present shipping position was carefully summarisedin a memorandum by the Allied Maritime Transport Councilof August 26th last.   The substance of the conclusionsarrived at is as follows.  The most important factors inthe present tonnage position are that world buildingiincluding American! now exceeds world losses, but thatAllied or world building (excluding American) is stillless than losses.  As the excess of American buildingover losses is, on the most favourable computation. lessthan the increased demands for the American Army, itfollows-that the tonnage available for the needs of therest of the world, and in particular for the EuropeanAllies is smaller and is till diminishing.   The tonnageunder the control of the European Allies is about 2 milliontons deadweight [a dead weight ton is equivalent to abouttwo-thirds of a gross ton) loss than at tne beginning oft^he cereal year 1917-18.   The acquisition of Dutch vessels,and agreements with Norway, Sweden *md Denmark (off-set bythe obligations for Belgian relief, Swiss needs eto. whichhave been or are likely to be assumed as the result ofthose agreements), may be taken to have given the European^llies a net gain of about \ million tons deadweight.  Thejarriage of American troops now means a loss to importsjquivaJLent to the loss of about f million tons deadweight,tage available one year ago.  As a matter of factit appears probable that in order to carrv out the Americanprogramme a large amount of extra tonnage will need to beallotted to America particularly in the remaining monthsof this year, (it is&quot;estimated that each 5.000 tons of .*imports saved will enable about 1 000 additional Americansoldiers to be maintained in and therefore sent to France.)Moreover, further calls seem likely to be made for-tonnagein connection with the new expeditions to Russia.(1)
1 &amp; 9In view of these considerations it appears that inspite of the improvement in the relation &quot;between Alliedbuildings and Allied sinkings, the position in thefollowing year will be a difficult one.  No doubt it ispossible that some savings may still be made throughimproved organisation in the use of the shipping thatis available.   But, &quot;against this has to be set &quot; he factto which Sir Norman Hill has called attention, thatthe control of distribution exercised in this countryby the Ministry of Pood has involved considerablecongestion at the ports, since it is difficult   to workthe control effectively if stocks aro * - released tothe private storehouses scattered over the country -and that this involves delay in the turning round ofvessels.  On the whole thore seems little doubt that,if tho war continues, it will be necessary for theAllies to cut down still further their civilian importsduring the coming year,   in this general cut the UnitedKingdom will, of course, bo involved.   It is, therefore,of interest to sot out the present position as regardscertain important stocks.The situation of the principal food stocks asreported by the Ministry oi Food is summarised below.The figures include harvest estimates, which introducessome uncertainty but the comparison with the correspond-ing figures for 1917 is valuable.I.

The low import of wheat during the monthspreoe ding,h&amp;xvmt in 191** as- compared with the Tory highimports in tie corresponding months of 1917, when thegreat reserve stock was &quot;being accumulated, explains thefact that in spite of a good wheat harvest the positionis not quite so favourable as it was a year ago.

The monthly consumption of motor,spirit is32,000 tons and the estimated October consumption ofleeroaene is 45,000 tons.      The Motor Spirit position latherefore good and the kerosene position ^satisfactory..III.. Timber.(a) Sawn Timber.The imports .of July, August and September -the ordinary importing season - have,/been actuallylow or than those of tho three previous months.    TheSeptember Import was l 2,0Q0 tons as against a presentestimated monthly consumption of about 300,000 tops(imported and home grown)?*stocks of imported and home grown timber com-bined, which amounted to 1,212^.000 tons on May 3i&amp;t,were &amp;% 1,038,000 tons on August 31 and must hav*fallen well below 1,000,000 tons by September 30jii.The consumption for the y/hole of 1918 has beenestimated at 3,600,000 tons..    It is hoped Uiat ihe totaloutput of home grown timber for the year may reaui2,000ft000 tons, which wa3,ihe figure of annual oucput -desired when the Timber Supplies Department was startedin 1917.    Taking into ao count home output, stock qy andimports the Department has estimated for a stock 6f    .1,000,000 tons on January 1st. 1919; but recent irjeresdeddemandB from the front and from the U.S. armies combinedwith the comparatively/lo^ level of imports may make theposition much lees favourable, unless steps aro taken toincrease shipments.(b) Pitrfod.Owing to &apos;1he Successful development of HomeGrown Pitwood the situation in S. Wales has improvedappreciably in the course of the year.    Stocks there arenot heavy but, in conjunction with the small import stillpermitted and the steadjy flow of native pitwood, they arelikely to prove adequate.    Elsewhere stocks are, generallyspeaking, ample.IV.   P aper&apos;      lap eremaking mat er ials.The importjOju Paper and Paper-making materialsfor the nine months. tJan.-3opttt 1918, has been only 9$less than in the corresponding period of 1917.   (3ee*Section II.)    The Scandinavian tonnage position haspermitted a larger  mport than had been anticipatedin ships which cannpt be directed to other routes.Stocks are light but stock figures are not available.The increased use of waste paper and home produced rawmaterials gener&amp;U^ continues.(4)
Y* -nftstilo Materials. 164s(a) Cotton,.,,The total import for 9 months has been 461,600tons, which is &amp;fo less than the corresponding import&apos;in 1917, But as this reduction is almost exactly bait,anced by the reduction in re-exports, net importshave not fallen.off.  But in 1917 stocks carried overfrom 1916 were available whereas now the industry i3,for American Cotton, entirely dependent upon the my^-tity imported which is only sufficient to enable 55$of machinery; to be run for a reduced number of hours.The stock of Egyptian Ootton is equal to about lSiuoeks.consumption,ft) ffofcL&quot;been        &apos;The import Jan,-Sent. 1918 has/pn]y 321,000,000. ftsas compared with 523,000,000 lbs. in tw correspondingperiod of 1917,  Nevertheless &quot;the stock in hand on  ;.October 1st was still 177,000,000 lbs,as compared with252,000,000 lbe. at the beginning of the year.   Theoxisting stock is anciuii for about 5 months1 consumptionat present rates.   Monthly consumption has not been soheavy as was anticipated in reports made earlier in theyear.  In spite of the apparently good stock however  ,there is difficulty in mooting all requirements, omng&apos;to shortages of particular classes of wool, and W.O.,specifications have had to be modified accordingly, - *Civilian consumption is now much curtailed,,(,.c) ELsflLu,Stocks of imported flax are very low though tho newhome crop provides for the immediate future.    Only afcout9,000 tons  of flax and &quot;tow have been imported thisyear&apos; up to October 1st, as compared with 61,000 tonsJan.-Sept. 1917,   It is hoped th&amp;t a further 15-20.000tons may be secured before the snd of the year, but theposition remains uncertain.&quot;Any resulting difficulties will be mainly felt in1919,(fl) MaiHeavy imports in August and September have complete-ly changed &quot;the situation, which was difficult threemonths ago,  $n ft&amp;tober 1st there wero 80,000 tons lahand egamst a ninthly consumption which is not ojpeo-ted to rise above 16,000 tons.  Even with light importshenceforward there shouid be no difficulty for the next6 months at least.

1653.X, In September-total importb into the United Kingdomamounted to 2.756,000 tons which is 4$ below the figurefor September 1917 and 44 below that of September 1913.2. The following points may be noted.    In September1918 imports of grain and flour were down 19$ as againstSeptember 1917. &apos; Meat imports as against September 1917A?as     were up some 34$*    Iron ore/up 1.0%.   Imports oftimber were very small compared with September 1917. thereduction being 51$;   for the 9 months ended Septemberhowever tho decline is only&apos;9$, as this year the inmost. has been more evgnly spread.   Raw wool was down 31$ onthe monjh and 38$ on the nine months.   Raw Cotton wasdown 60$ on tho month and 8$ on the nine months.    It isimportant to note that the figures for mineral oils &apos;include the vory heavy imports of Admiralty fuel oil.Total exports in Soptembor amounted to 3.370,000tons which is 13$ below the figure for September 1917,Coal exports amounted to 2.990,000 tons, or 10% lessthan in September 1917.   lost important laanuf&amp;cturegshow a reduction in tonnage on September 1917 - ironand steel of 39$ cotton manufactures of 36$ wcqlmanufactures of 40$ and *other textiles1 of 5^&amp;4* While imports in September were down 44$ ou 1913the entrances of British and Foreign vessels (with cargo)were down 58$;  and while imports were down 4$ on 1917tonnage entrances were up 4$*   Thus, as against 1913 tholoading factor is 33$ greater and as against 1917 8$less.5* *In September British entrances with cargo amountedto 1,686*000 net tons, that is 7% more than In Septeisber,&quot;1917*   Britisn clearances wore 1,350,000 - 2l$lessthan in September, 1917*   Ibreiga entrances amounted to264,000 tons, 17$ loss than in 8eptnnl)er. 1917 - andforeign clearances to 617,000 tons, 20% hsn than isSeptember, 1917. r8* I?
