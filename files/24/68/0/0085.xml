From thistract he had effectively excluded the Turks, with whom he was in a chronic state of war,and during the Turco-Itaiian war of 1911-12 the Italians entered into relations withhim, and supplied him with arms.On the other hand, his independence had never bepn recognised by foreign Powers ;and in,the division of the Arabian Peninsula into a Turkish and a British sphere, effectedby the Anglo-Turkish Conventions of the 29th July, 1913, and 9th March, 1914,* theIdrisi&apos;s country was implicitly recognised by His Majesty&apos;s Government as being underthe sovereignty of Turkey.The fact, however, that the Idrisi possessed a coastline and two ports Meidi andJezan over which the Turks had no control, brought him into direct relations withforeign governments on commercial matters, and he was thus in touch with HisMajesty&apos;s Resident at Aden.fIn August 1913 he sent his Minister to Aden to discover His Majesty&apos;s Govern-menfs attitude towards him (in view, no doubt, of the Anglo-Turkish Conventionconcluded shortly before). And he again had a confidential agent at Aden in September1914.1 At that time Turkey had not intervened in the war, but her attitude wasalready threatening, and on the 11th September, L914, the Resident at Aden accordinglytelegraphed to Bombay suggesting that overtures to the Idrisi should be made by HisMajesty&apos;s Government on the following lines : &quot; We could make Idrisi an offer of protection and friendship and a distinctadjudication of his claims against Imam; we could also make over to him Farsan,&apos;    which was his property once and which was taken by Porte; also we would leaveopen his ports Meidi, Habl, and Djezan.&quot;The Idrisi, the Turks, and the Imam of Sanaa were engaged in a three-corneredduel, and, in the event of war with Turkey, it was clearly His Majesty&apos;s Governmentsinterest to obtain the co-operation against the Turks of at least one, and if possibleboth, of the two Arab rulers. The Turks, however, made a very high bid for thelmam&apos;s friendship, and it rapidly became clear that lie would not take sides with usagainst them. In these circumstances the establishment of relations with the Idrisibecame essential.On the 30th October, 1914, the Resident telegraphed to the Govemment of Indiareporting that the Idrisfs agent had assured him that the Idrisi had not come to termswith the Imam and would never do so with the Turks, and proposing that a verbalmessage should be sent him through the agent.IThis proposal was transmitted by the Viceroy to the India Office in a telegram ofthe 1st November, 1914H :-&quot;It seems desirable that negotiations with Idrisi&apos;s agent should immediatelybe commenced by Resident on lines proposed in his telegram of the 11th ultimowith these modifications. Ee should offer our protection and friendship and goodoffices to Idrisi, but not adjudication in settlement of differences with Imam, alsoprotection of his ports Djezan, Meidi, and Habl. Restoration to him of Farsanin event of war might be hinted but not promised by Resident. In negotiatingJ with Idrisi Resident should be warned to do nothing likely finally to estrangeImam, who appears to be wavering.&quot;* See Draft of Despatch, dated August 1914, to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Constantinople,t lieference to trade between Aden and Idrisi ports in 124.j3.15.J 59460/14 and 38722/15 (reprint of correspondence cuminunicaled by Government of India).5 65723/14.I 66302/14 and 68203/14.[884J B
2On the 31st October, 1914,* the India Office, anticipating the above telegram, hadtelegraphed instructions to the Yiceroy, regarding the Residents proposal, as follows : &quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government are unwilling, subject to anything which youmay have to say, to commit themselves to a definite offer to the Tdrisi, fulfilmentof which they may be unable to enforce even in the most favourable circumstances,and they are not prepared to undertake adjudication of details between his claimsand those of the Imam. His Majesty&apos;s Government will, however, be glad toexercise their good offices in bringing the two parties together .... Assuranceshould be given to the Idrisi that Great Britain and her Allies will not touch theHoly Places or Jeddah, and that they have no intention of taking naval actionwhich will affect his ports. In the general settlement on the conclusion of the war,he may count upon their diplomatic assistance to secure his autonomy. You maypromise him such arms and ammunition as can be spared by you.&quot;Their instructions differed from the Viceroy&apos;s in omitting all mention of the FarsanIslands, a point in which the Foreign Office concurred and on which specific instructionswere sent to the Yiceroy by the India Office on the 7th November, I 9l4.tMeanwhile, on the 4th November, 1914, the Resident had telegraphed that theIdrisis agent was leaving Aden to communicate to the Idrisi the terms of the Viceroy&apos;stelegram of the 1st November, 1914, and that it was urgent that the negotiations shouldbe carried through.  On the 21st November, 1914, the Idrisi wrote to the Resident expressing approvalof the suggestion that the Arabs should unite against the Turks, thanking HisMajesty&apos;s Government for the promise to send him arms and to leave his portsunblockaded, and asking that his independence should be assured, and a reliablerepresentative sent to discuss the preliminaries for an agreement.^In view of this letter, the Government of India made the following proposals tothe India Office in a telegram dated the 20th December, 1914 \\ :-&quot;A reply might, we consider, be sent to the Resident, either by a letter orthrough a reliable source, to the effect that Idrisi&apos;s expressions of friendship havebeen received with satisfaction by the British Government, who are prepared togive him a guarantee of independence if he succeeds definitely in effecting a unionof his Arabs against the Turks and in preventing their use of his country as abase of operations against Great Britain; also that the extent to which heco-operates will determine the question of any further reward.&quot;And on the 28th December, 1914, the India Office, with the concurrence of theForeign Office, accordingly instructed the Viceroy by telegram as follows     &quot;The Imam&apos;s attitude leaves us no alternative but to give a guarantee ofindependence to Idrisi, and I therefore approve your proposals, although theguarantee exceeds assurances sanctioned in my telegram of the 31st October.&quot;On. the 29th January, 1915, the Besident reported that the Idrisi&apos;s Minister hadarrived at Aden to negotiate,^ and on the 30th January, 1915, that the Idrisi had seizedthe Farsan Islands, forestalling the British Navy.ttOn the.3rd February, 1915, the Resident telegraphed as follows^: &quot; The Idrisi&apos;s Minister here is quite prepared to attack the Turks at once.... He aslcs for a proteci orate treaty with us, and wants arms and ammunitionimmediately,  nd a sum of money to further his object .... Terms of anysubsequent treaty need only include his security against attack by sea, and apromise of diplomatic support after the war to secure autonomy against his rival,the Imam.&quot;In reply to this telegram, the Government of India sent the Resident instructions,of which they informed the India Office on the 5th February, 1915     &quot; We have .... authorised Resident to negotiate treaty with Idrisi onunderstanding that this is subject to confirmation of Government of India, and thatany terixs likely finally to alimate Imam while still wavering are avoided.&quot;* G6302/14 and 68203/14. t 6iK570/14.

The India Office replied on the 17th February, 1915, by approving the Viceroy&apos;saction, but requesting that they should be given an opportunity of considering theterms of the treaty in substance.^&apos;On the 9th March, 1915, the Resident at Aden telegraphed again : f&quot;Idrisi representative here is extremely anxious to make a treaty of friendshipon the basis of security of his seaboard against all enemies, and our diplomaticsupport after conclusion of hostilities to effect his autonomy against all rivals. All.. this is as already intimated reasonable, and a necessary preliminary to a pact.&quot; Thetelegram then proceeds to urge that certain additional requests for arms on thepart of the Idrisi shall be granted. &quot; As representative wishes to leave for Djezanin three days, I ask for early sanction. After putting case before his master thisagent will return, to Aden to conclude a treaty.&quot;In answer to this telegram, the Government of India instructed the Resident asfollows on the 13th March, 1915 :-J&quot; You should inform Idrisfs agent that, before the Government of India cancontemplate the gift of further arms or money, they must first see the draftagreement which Idrisi is prepared to conclude with them, and have some positiveevidence of the co-operation he is prepared to offer in return for such agreement.&quot;And on the 15th March, 191.5. the Viceroy telegiaphed in the same sense to theIndia Office. IOn the l(5th March, 1915, however, the India Office replied to the Viceroyapproving the proposals of the Resident in his telegram of the 9th March, 1915.11The terms of a treaty were accordingly drafted at Aden by the British authoritiesthere and the Idrisi&apos;s Minister, and on the 30th April, 1915, the Viceroy transmitted tothe India Office a report from the Resident, dated the 28th April, 1915,^[ announcingthat a treaty had been concluded with the Idrisi, subject to ratification by the Govern-ment of iudia, and that the Idrisi would lose no time in acting against the Turks.A copy of the treaty, signed, and dated the 30th April, 191.5, was communicated tothe Foreign Office by the India Office on the 26th May, 1915.** The text of it, in theform in which it was eventually ratified, is appended to the present memorandum, buta summary of its main provisions may be given here : Article 1. Names of the signatories.Art. 2. The objects are (a) to war against the Turks and (o) to make a pact offriendship between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Idrisi and his tribesmen.Art. 3. The Idrisi is to attack the Turks in the Yemen and extend his territoriesat their expense.Art. 4. He will abstain from hostile or provocative action against the Imam so longas the latter does not join the Turks.Art. 5. &quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government undertake to safeguard the Idrisfs territoriesfrom all attack on the seaboard from any enemy who may molest him; to guarantee hisindependence in his own domain ; and, at tne conclusion of the war, to use everydiplomatic means in their power to adjudicate between the rival claims of the Idrisiand the Imam, or any other rival.&quot;Art. 6. &quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government have no desire to enlarge their borders onArabian soil,&quot; but desire that there shall be friendly relations (a) between all the Arabrulers, each in his own sphere; and (6) between each of them and His Majesty &apos;sGovernment.Art. 7. His Majesty&apos;s Government promise to assist the Idrisi with arms andmoney, in proportion to the part played by the Idrisi in the war.Art. 8. His Majesty&apos;s Government, while blockading all Turkish ports, will con-tinue to leave trade open between the Idrisi ports and Aden.Art. 9. Ratification by the Government of India is necessary to make this treatyvalid.On the 20th May, 1915, the Government of India commented on these terms asfollows in a despatch to the India Office : ft&quot; The only point that appears to require definite qualification is the expression&apos; Arabian soil&apos; in article 6, as this scarcely falls in with our position in Mesopotamia.If the words &apos; Western Arabia&apos; were substituted for &apos; Arabian soil&apos; - this objectionwould be removed, and our intentions would be sufficiently defined in the treaty.* 20143/15. t 28470,15. \ 50398/15. . g 30060/15.

4&quot; It might also be urged that, by allowing the Idrisi, under article 3, to extendhis territories, and, at the same time, under article 5, guaranteeing his independencehereafter, we may be bringing ourselves into an embarrassing position vis-a-visother Arab chiefs, but our position in this matter is safeguarded by the condition (JjJ^that the extension of the Idrisi&apos;s territories should be at the expense of the Turks,and, should he hereafter involve himself in a collision with other Arab chiefs by anaggressive policy, we could point to this condition, and disavow his action.&quot; Further, it might have been desirable to insert a clause giving British andBritish Indian traders free access to the Idrisi&apos;s ports, but this might legitimatelybe held to be a corollary of the pact of friendship which it is the object of thetreaty to consolidate.&quot; As any further assistance in funds or munitions to the Idrisi is explicitly7 tobe in accordance with the measure of the Idrisi&apos;s activities, our responsibilities inthis matter would appear to be sufficiently safeguarded.&quot; We think, therefore, that, although the treaty as drafted is open to objectionon the ground that it is neither very clear nor very concise, it will, if the smallamendment suggested (in the first paragraph quoted) above be effected, adequatelymeet the requirements of the situation. We would ask, therefore, for authority toratify it as it stands, subject to this qualification. To return it for extensiverevision to our Political Resident would be to endanger the ultimate success of thenegotiations, and would, at any rate, involve undesirable delay. If your Lordshipagrees, we should be glad of orders by telegraph.&apos;&apos;In answer to this, the India Office, with the concurrence of the Foreign Office/&apos;telegraphed to the Viceroy as follows on the 21st June, 1915 : f&quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government approve treaty with substitution of words&apos; Western Arabia.&apos; We prefer this not so much because of Mesopotamia as becauseof Sheikh Saiyid, which it may be necessary to annex after war, and which wreregard as Southern rather than Western Arabia. This possibility should be bornein mind in any language used to Arabs.&quot;And these instructions were transmitted by the Government of India to the &apos;Resident at Aden in a relegram dated the 24th June, 19154 Copies of the treaty,which had been forwarded from Aden to Simla on the 1st May, 1915, were now sentback on the 28th June, 1915, for this alteration to be made ; but on the 20th July, 1915,the Resident reported that it was not possible at that stage to get hold of thesignatories.On the 23rd August, 1915, the Resident reported ^ further that, in the Arabictext of the treaty, the counterpart to the English words &quot; Arabian soil&quot; (Art. 6) was&quot; the Yemen.&quot;&quot; It was explained to Saiyid Mustafa, the signatory of the treaty, who isnow here, that the word &apos; Yemen &apos; was not an adequate translation of the amendedEnglish, but he did not approve of any alteration. He remarked that, were theBritish Government to annex Sheikh Said, Mokha or Hodeida, his master would beonly too pleased, as he indeed was at our occupation of Kamaran.I &quot;In these circumstances, it is not considered politic to amend the Arabicreading.   The English wording is of course authoritative.&quot;It does not seem therefore necessary to re-write the treaty, for such acourse would create suspicion in the Arab mind.&quot;In view of this despatch the Yiceioy telegraphed as follows to the India Office onthe 5th October, 1915 :-iI&quot;We do not consider use of term Yemen in the Arab text open to seriousobjection. Should we desire to take over Sheikh Said, our action would hejustifiable, in view of Arab and Turkish acts of aggression, under a broad interpreta-tion of clause 6 of the proposed treaty. We therefore suggest immediate ratification.&quot;And this was approved by the India Office, with the concurrence of the Foreign MOffice,^ on the 23rd October, 1915.** &apos;The Treaty was accordingly ratified by the Viceroy in Council on the 6th November,1915,ft with the substitution of the words &quot; Western Arabia&quot; for &quot;Arabian soil&quot; inthe English text, but with no alteration in the Arabic.* 79794/15. t 83129/15.

Relation of Commitments to the Idrisi o British Desiderata.The British desiderata involved in this treaty with the Idrisi appear to he (a) theextension of the British &quot; trucial system&quot; to the whole of the Arabian Peninsula, and(6) the maintenance and improvement of our position at Aden.The general policy underlying both these desiderata is expressed in article 6 of thetreaty; but, as the Government of India remarked in their despatch of the 20th May,1915, the terms seem to lack precision.As regards (a) it is an essential condition in a-trucial treaty that the independentruler who is a party to it shall have no relations with foreign Powers except throughHis Majesty&apos;s Government, and shall not lease or alienate to them any portion of histerritory. In the present treaty this is nowhere laid down, and the India Office, intheir letter of the 17th June, 1915, to the Foreign Office covering the Government ofIndias despatch of the 20th May, 19 I 8, justly remarked in this connection (79794/15) : &quot; The matter referred to in paragraph 5 of the despatch (British trade inIdrisi ports and territory) will, in Mr. Chamberlain&apos;s opinion, be more suitablydealt with after the war, when some further treaty with the Idrisi will probablybe necessary in any case, e.g., to ensure that he does not cede any port or islandto a foreign Power, and to regulate the arms traffic.&quot;Again, in the stricter forms of trucial treaty, His Majesty&apos;s Government undertaketo keep the peace between the other party to the treaty and his neighbours possessingsimilar treaties with His Majesty&apos;s Government, while the other party undertakes notto resort to force for the settlement of disputes, but to refer them to His Majesty&apos;sGovernment for arbitration.In the present treaty His Majesty&apos;s Government merely undertake to endeavour,by diplomatic means, to adjudicate between the claims of the Idrisi and his neighbours.This was perhaps the most we could do at the time when the treaty was drafted, sinceneither the Sherif of Mecca nor the Imam of Sanaa were at that time in relations withus. But now that the Sherif&apos; has made an alliance with us, and the Imam hasapproached us with this object, it becomes important that we should place our relationswith these three rulers as far as possible on an equal footing, and assume a greatercontrol over their relations with one another.The difficulties with which we shall be confronted are illustrated by the dispute in1916 between the Idrisi and the Sherif over the possession of-Kunflda (182183/16 and215155/16 (No. 142)), in which the Idrisi accepted our award provisionally, but onlysubject to reconsideration, under article 5 of-our treaty, at the conclusion of the war.The still more difficult problem of demarcation between the Idrisi and the Imamwas raised by the Resident at Aden in July of the same year (133274/16 and 133783/1.6),but this was deprecated by the Viceroy as premature (136686/16).Whatever settlement of these questions we may succeed in making, freshdemarcation and allegiance disputes between these three rulers will continually bearising, and it is submitted that His Majesty&apos;s Government will not be able to dealwith them effectively unless they conclude a trucial treaty on stricter lines with theImam, and supplement their treaty with the Idrisi, and their still more indefinitearrangements with the Sherif, in this direction.As regards trade, again, His Majesty&apos;s Government guarantee the Idrisi facilitiesat Aden under article 8, while there is no corresponding guarantee for British tradein the Idrisfs ports and territory. The Government of India, however, pointed out intheir despatch of the 20th May, 1915, that this may be regarded as implicitly coveredby the &quot; pact of friendship &quot; laid down in article 1.Finally, as regards (6) the position of Great Britain at Aden, it may perhapsbe doubted whether the words &quot; Western Arabia&quot; in the English text of article 6,and &quot; Yemen&quot; in the Arabic, do strictly admit of any territorial enlargementof our Protectorate. And our case on this point is prejudiced by our negotiations wiihKing Husein. For in his first letter of July 1915 to Sir H. McMahon, Husein, whilehe excepted the Aden Protectorate from the boundaries he claimed for Arabindependence, made no reference to rectifications of the Aden frontier; andSir H. McMahon, when, in his letter of the 24th October, 1915, he accepted theproposed boundaries, subject to modifications in Syria, implicitly pledged himself, asregards Aden, to the status quo.
6In practice, however, any improvement of our position at Aden would affect notthe Sherif and the Idrisi, but the Imam. And though the former may find it necessaryin public to avoid signing away Moslem, soil to the unbeliever, or Arab soil to theforeigner, they would neither of them be sorry to see their rival, the Imam, weakenedby an extension of British power at his expense. In. fact, the Idrisi&apos;s Minister has, inprivate, quite frankly adopted this point of view. (.152356/15.) The real struggle overthe Aden boundary will come in our negotiations with the Imam, and in this case lackof precision might be fatal. Apart from the Imam, we have to consider France, withher claims to Sheikh Said ; but we have safeguarded ourselves here by the reservationattached to the self-denying proviso in article 10 of the Anglo-French Agreement ofthe 16th May, 1.916. The two Powers agree &quot;neither to acquire themselves, nor toconsent to a third Power acquiring territorial possessions in the Arabian Peninsula.. . . . This, however, shall not prevent such readjustment of the Aden frontier as maybe necessary in consequence of recent Turkish aggression.&apos;&apos;We are safeguarded against Italy also by her inclusion in the provisions of theabove article, under article 7 of the Italian Agreement of the 18th August. 1917.As regards our desiderata at Aden, therefore, the present treaty with the Idrisimay be regarded as reasonably satisfactory.APPENDIX.Text of Treaty of April 30, 1915.This Treaty of Friendship and Goodwill is signed by Major-General I). G-. L. Shaw, the PoliticalResident, Adon, on behalf of the British Government and by Saiyid Mustaia-biu-Saiyid Abdul Ali onthe part of His Eminence Saiyid Muhamrnad-bin-Ali-biu-Muhanmiad-bin-Aluned-bin-Idris the IdrisiSaiyid and Amir of Sabia and its environments.2. Its main objects are to war against the Turks and to consolidate a pact of friendship betweenthe British Government and the Idrisi Saiyid, above mentioned, and his tribesmen.3. The Idrisi Saiyid agrees to attack and to endeavour to drive the Turks from their stations iuthe Yemen and to the best of his power to harass the Turkish troops in the direction of the Yemenand to extend his territories at the expense of the Turks.4. The Saiyid&apos;s prime objective will be against the Turks only, and be will abstain from anyhostile or provocative action against Imam Yahya, so long as the latter does not join hands with theTurks.5. The British Government undertakes to safeguard the Idrisi Saiyid&apos;s territories from all attackon the sea-board from any enemy who may molest him; to guarantee his independence in his owndomain, and at the conclusion of the war to use every diplomatic means in its power to adjudicatebetween the rival claims of the Idrisi Saiyid and the Imam Yahya or any other rival.6. The British Government has no desire to enlarge its borders in Western Arabia, but wishessolely to see the various Arab rulers living peacefully and amicably together, each in his own sphere,and all in friendship with the British Government.7. As a mark of its appreciation of the work to be performed by the Idrisi Saiyid, the BritishGovernment has aided him with both funds and munitions, and will continue to assist him in theprosecution of the war so long as it lasts, in accordance with the measure of the L.lrisi&apos;s activities.8. Finally, while maintaining a strict blockade on all Turkish ports in the lied Sea, the BritishGovernment has for some months past been giving the Idrisi Saiyid full and free scope to trade andtraffic between his ports and Aden, and this concession the British Government, in token of thefriendship existing, will continue uninterruptedly to maintain.9. This treaty will be held to be valid after its ratification by the Government of India.Signed this day, Fridav, the 30th April, 1915 A.D., corresponding with the 15th of Jamad Shani1333 Hijra.: D.
