The War Priorities Committee have considered this recommendation and they have decided to approve it on the understanding that it its intention is merely to limit the number of departments authorised to place direct contracts through the agency of departmental building organisations, and that it is not intended to apply to such matters as work that may be required to be undertaken by Railway, Port and Harbour and Similar authorities.

I am directed by the Chairman of the War Priorities Committee to forward this approval for endorsement by the War Cabinet.
