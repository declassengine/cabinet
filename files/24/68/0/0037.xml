!        &apos; [ffjl Political Intelligence;Departed,V^Vy^v.................. ^^/IA1L FOREIGN OFFICE. -Confidential.Denmark /007.October 27th, 1918.THE SIjESYIG QUESTION.The Slesvig quest ion having come to the fore during thelast fortnight ana. continual reference having been made in ourpress and elsewhere to Article 5 of the Treaty of Prague, thesubstance of the clauses in the various Treaties relative tothis question may be of some interest.The Treaty of Vienna of the SOth October, 1864, whichfollowed on the defeat of Denmark by Austria and Prussia, con-tains the renouncement by Denmark to Austria and Prussia ofall her rights to the imchies of Slesvig, Holstein and Dauen-bourg, as well as the islands belonging to the first of these.These Duchies came, consequently, under the joint control *fAustria and Prussia but in the Treaty of Prague of the 253rdAugast, 1866, between Austria and&apos;Prussia, Article 5 trans-ferred all the rights acquired by Austria in the Tieatf ofVienna of 1G64, over the Duchies of Holstein and blesvig toPrussia &quot;with the condition that the populations of the-noi-thern districts.of iileevig shall be ceded to Denmark if,by a free vote, they express a,wish to be united to Denmark&quot;.This condition, inserted in deference     the Views *f NapoleonIII, naturally became practically a dead letter after theFranco-Prussian War of 1870-71, ; Nevertheless, at Vienna onthe 11th October, 1870, a Treaty was ooncluded between Austria-Hungary and Germany., modifying Article 5 of the Treaty nfPrague.    Article 1 &amp;f this Treaty definitely lays Sown that/the
the words in Article 5 of the Treaty of Prague &quot;^ith the con-dition that the populations of the northern districts of Sles-vig shall &quot;be ceded to Denmark if, &quot;by a free vote, they expressa wish to &quot;be united to Denmark&quot; shall be annulled.     Denmarkhas consequently no diplomatic claim to the restoration of herlost provinces,     The condition attached to Article 5 of theTreaty of Prague no longer exists,     Not only was it annulledby arrangement &quot;between the two Powers who had themselves drawnup and signed the Treaty, &quot;but the terms of a convention oon-cluded in 1907Ycetween.Denmark and Prussia regarding thenationality of &quot;optants&quot; (those inhabitants of Slesvig who,in accordance with the terms of the Treaty of Vionna of 1864,chose Danish nationality) and thoir descendants in Slesvigmake it quite clear that the Treaty of Prague is no concernof Denmark and that the. Treaty of Vienna of 1864 is the. basis -for the territorial arrangements between the two States.During the last fortnightthe Danish pross, both metro -politan and provincial, both those papers supporting theGovernment and those of the Opposition, have, according topress telegrams, published articles to the effect that the.time has now come for the redressing of the -wrong done toDenmark in 1864,     The Swedish and Norwegian press have alsogiven attention to, the question.     Some of these papers troatit as Scandinavian, pointing out that it would be in Germany^own interests, with a view to future friendly relations with ,Scandinavia, to hand back North Slesvig to Dnnmark and it iscredibly reported that Mr, Branting, the Swedish socialistleader, had, at the request of some Danes, telegraphed toPresident Wilson reminding him of the&apos; importance of the  .question. &apos;  .   -The demand of the Danish press is apparently for there-incorporation in Denmark of the Danish-speaking population
,-of Slesvig known in vjesduiarfc as &quot;Sonderjylland&quot;.     ProfessorBirck, an eminent professor of Copenhagen University, and inem-ber of the M..ketin$, whose utterances by tho way carry con-si&amp;erable weight in - G-e;&quot;many, doubtless voices Danish opinionin stating as he has lately dona in &quot;Nationaltidende&quot; thatDenmark, taking hex stand on the rigorous application of right,only desires territory which is absolutely Danish ana that shohas no wish to become the guardian of the Kiel Canal.     Hesignificantly adds that until Germany has allowed Slesvig tocheese her nationality for herself, she cannot expect fromDenmark a policy which is more than simply correct.     In thefsame paper a prominent business man at KLensborg in Slesvigalso maintains that no Dane wishes Slesvig and Holstein to bereturned to Denmark nor for the Kiel Canal to be handed everto her care.    He declares that if any difficulty arises withregard to the rights of the German minority in Slesvig, thepeoples of Slesvig must decide the matter for themselves- andif they decide that the frontier language shall be the frontiernationality, neither Denes nor Germans&apos; must raise any ob-jection.Information has come to hand on the 18th instant from areliable source that Herr Hanssen, the Danish member for Sles-vig in the German Eeiohstag, who has lately returned from Ber-lin to his constitutiancy, has clandestinely sent an emissaryto Copenhagen to take up the Slesvig question with those in-terested, with the intention of encouraging the Danish-speak-ing population of Slesvig themselves to raise the question oftheir transference to Denmark.    It was hoped that this actionwould lead to a, resolution in favour of restoration beingpassed in the Reichstag.    Here again, it is to be noted, itis &amp; question of purely Danish districts.iThere is obviously some inter-connection between Herr-3- /Hanssen1s
laanaeon^s -aoti-v-itios-and a tela-grsar-emanating from the GermanJress Borosa, now -under the control of Herr Erisberger, whiohap^earaa in ova papers of &quot;the Slst instant.    This stated thatthe despatoh of the German reply to President Wilson haflt beendelayed because of news which had led to fresh considerationsand $hat it was reported in Reiohstag circles that Germany had3feceST0&amp; from a neighbouring state a note, the exceptionallymoderate wording of which deserves recognition, and in whichit is proposed that the German Government should submit tobenevolent execution certain contractual points dating from thesixties which at the time remained unfulfilled.    The GermanoommunigtiS adds that it is remarkable that in the note ingaeetion special emphasis is laid on the fact that the parti-cular nationality referred to rejects unanimously the furtheraspirations suggested by the Entente.    Obviously, this oom-muniqu3 can only refer to Denmark and the Slesvig question.The position of the Danish Government in regard to thematter is obscure,.    Tvvo reports having come to hand that Ger-many had expressed her willingness to hand over Slesvig toDenn&amp;rk in return, according to the one report, for eoonomioconcessionsj and according to the other, for a fort on an is-land in the little Belt or on the mainland, the Minister foitForeign Affairs asked as to the truth of thase reports oate-gorioally denied that there had been now or at any time ne- l,gotiat^ons v/ith Germany about Slesvig,    This was on the 1.4thOctober, but at a later date on the 19th October, it was stat-ed in a confidential conversation by two Conservative poli-ticians that at a secret session of the Rigsdag, the Ministerfor Foreign Affairs, examined by the leaders of tho politicalparties, allowed that negotiations with Germany were in pro-gress.    The inforai&amp;nts added that the present Danish Govem-ment did not wish to acquire all the Danish-speaking districts-4- /but
trot- only -a-wry -snioJa-porl^on.^&apos; torrl-toiTr ^ modesty of thoclaim &quot;being, it was BBint&amp;inod, due to the fact that the popu-larfcions of the parts in question were mostly agrarian and wouldoonsoquently be in opposition to tho present Government.By the 20th instant, political circles in Denmark werein such a state of ferment alxmt the matter and so many rumourswere flying about that the Danish  rime Minister found it in-oumbent to issue to the Danish press a denial of the reportscurrent in Denmark that an agreement had been oonoludod withGermany with a view to the return of Worth Slesvig to Denmark.It is to be noted that the denial Is that an agreement has beenoonoluded, not that negotiations are taking place.    It wouldappear improbable that the Danish Government has approachedGermany with regard to the Slesvig question.    The Dances areshrewd men of business with a keen eye to the main ohanoo and&apos;it is very unlikely that their Government would choose thepresent time, when the fortunes of Germany are on the down--grade, to take a step which they must *know would alienate sym-pathy in the Allied countries.    On the other hand, if, throughHerr Hanssen&apos;s independent action, the Danes of Slesvig agitatein the matter and the Reichstag, as is not inherently unlikely,passes a resolution in their favour, it is quite on the oardsthat the present Government would accept a settlement at thehands of Germany rather than by a refusal, to arouse ill-feolingand bitterness in Germany against herself.It is reported that a group of- Radical professors who &apos;wish for an immediate settlement with Germany, are exercisingconsiderable pressure on the Danish Government and it is quiteclear from information received that tho Danish Ilinister for &apos;Foreign Affairs is very anxious to avoid any settlement vtihiohmight give offence to Gormany. The old fear of Germany evi-dontly still has a firm hold on tho Danish Government, though-5** /the
^he 3^ople iss shaking-itself to some extent   rod from it.Sinoo the above was written, Herr Hansson, tho repre-sentative in the Reiehstag of the Danish element in Slesvig*has, in the Reichstag, on the 25th October demanded that anopportunity shall bo given to the population to veto whetherit will belong to Denmark or Germany.    Dr. Self, the newSooretary of State for Foreign Affaire, in his reply, pointedout that Denmark has, no claims on the basis of the Treaty ofPrague, as the condition attached to Artiele 6 of it wascancelled in 1878, and that the Danish Government has aoknow-ledged this faot by the Treaty of 1907 (vide page 2, para-graph 1),
