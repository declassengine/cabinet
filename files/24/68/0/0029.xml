MEMORANDUM on PERSONALITIES ON THE NEW TURKISH GOVERNMENT.

The only real personality in the new Government is Javid. The rest are more are more or less nonentities.

The news of the retention of Javid as Finance Minister, with Halil Bey as President of the Chamber, is the most significant fact. It has been Halil&apos;s job to run the Turkish Chamber for the C.U.P. all through the Young Turk r√©gime. The survival of Halil and Javid is a sign that though Enver&apos;s day may be over, Talaat is still in power behind the scenes and behind Talaat the Committee.

To take the members of the new Government in order:-

Izzett Pasha

An Albanian from Jakova. A good soldier, honest in the main, and an obvious man for the Committee to put up in order to inspire confidence. Before the war, when the Committee policy of settling the Yemen question by force had proved a failure, Izzet was sent down to make terms with the Imam and arranged a satisfactory settlement on a basis of autonomy.

This event, which was the grand success of Izzet&apos;s career, is significant, since autonomy for the Non-Turkish provinces is precisely the settlement which the new Government is once more proposing.

Reshid Akif.

An Albanian from Berat. (The appointment of two Albanians to prominent posts should be noted. There is probably some intrigue behind this which will become evident later.) Reshid is an "amiable nonentity."

Possiblyincluded in the Ministry to bluff on &quot;fight to the death* lines.Ifclussi Effendi.Paid agent of M.

After that Ambassador in London.His appointment as Minister for Foreign Affairs is an obviousattempt to appeal to&apos;us, but Rifaat, too, is an &quot;amiable nonentity&quot;Fethi Bey.Soldier;   an active member of the C.U.P.; helped-to startRevolution in 1968;   distinguished himself in Tripoli war;-. Presi-clent of Central C.U.P. in 1913, then Minister at^Sofia;.  somemonths ago returned to Constantinople, waa elected deputy and ledan opposition party against the C.U.P. Government..His opposition was certainly ineffective,, and probably a putup job.In accepting a post in the new Government he is more thanlikely to be in collusion with Talaat.Javid, Bey..    &apos;The real man in the new Government, all the others being putround him as camouflage.

He ;.is -oneof the innermost crirole of the C.U.P. and has-always run theirfinance.Kis. game will certainly be to work for lenient terns for&apos; Turkeyon the ground that if she is driven to destruction there will bea financial crash by which foreign financial interests in Turkeywill be losers.It is very significant that, lay great stress on the problem of the Turkishwar paper, &quot;backed by Germany.There is certainly a very grave problem here which has to.bedealt with, and is being dealt with, by the Allied Governments,But if, as seeems likely enough, we shall have to avert financialcatastrophe by taking on liabilities ourselves, this is absolutelyno reason for sparing Turkey.    Any further financial commitmentswe may have to make will be much better secured if Turkish ruleis reduced to the smallest possible limits.It is incredible that Javid should not still be hand-in-glovewith his old associates, namely the C.U.P. on the one hand andinternational&apos; financiers on the other.Je lal-J-iukhtar.. Bey. -A nonentity - whether amiable or not. is unknown.Hairi ffifendi.A genuinely honest Turk from Nigde in the interior of Anat*lia.Speaks only Turkish and has played little part in Turkish foreignpolicy. &apos; -TJas first Minister of Svkaf and introduced reforms irttap theadministration.-    In 1914 was made Sheikh-ul-Islam and resigned,in protest, it is rumoured, against the Armenian atrocities of1915, though he may have been influenced more by the C.U.lVs policjof cutting down the Sheikh-ul-1slam1 s jurisdiction in the sphere ofcivil Law.
Together with Halide Edib HaSSS?, Hairi Effendi represents, thesoundest element in the Turkish national movement, an element which&apos;concentrates on the work of internal reform in the Turkish speakingprovinces.Hairi has obviously been included in the Cabinet for hisvirtues, but it is practically impossible that he shouldinfluence its polioy, nor are his views on foreigi policylikely to be partiiularly enlightened of well informed.An honest man, but has a son and a nephew in the &quot;NationalBank&quot;.    This liaison is presumably the motive of his appointment.Said, fley.TJn-known, unless he be Said Bey Daud, an official in theMinistry of Foreign Affairs, whose brother-in*lsw is the agentfor various important foreign banks at Constantinople.A.bd-ur-Hahmann-Sheyif Bey.A Circassian.    Under the Hamidian regime was historiographerto the Ottoman Empire.    &quot;Amiable nonentity&quot;.This surve^y of the personalities of the new Grovernmeritseems toHear mt the ton tent ion that it is a sham, and that Talaat andthe Committee are still in power behind the soenes.     The;policy, as apears from information conveyed        through aconfidential channel, is to black-mail us with the fear of afinancial crash and a massacre of the Christians at Constantinople.
