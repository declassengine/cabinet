An important development has been made in the improvedmethod of diagnosing rubies.    whereas it used to take 15-30 daysf,   to arrive at a definite -diagnosis, by new methods which have beenorganised at Laboratory it Is possible to do this in a few hours.;: The advantage of this in connection with dealing with the disease- and notifying those bitten that they must undergo immediate treatmentis obvious.Anti-Swine fever serum.    During the week in question -        11,550 c.cwere issued for distribution to keep up the stocks at the variousU   centresrAnti-abortion Vaccine.

Following upon the complaints bythese men of being impeded in their work by the action of the Officerspf the Sea Fisheries Committee, the Board have now reoeivedcomplaints from Mussel Merchants at Hull of the small size of musselswhich have redently been supplied to them from Boston.    These,complaints confirm the opinion Which had been reached as the resultof enquiry that the kussel gatherers were taking mussels from thebeds not only below the minimum size fixed by the Committeefs Bye-lawa,but below the reduced size which the Committee had informallysanctioned as a war time measure.\test Cornwall Fishery Loan.    Difficulties have arisenthrough the -     Treasury limitation on the rate of interest whichBanks may allow on the accounts of their      customers.    The resultof this is to reduce the income which the Administrative Committeehad relied upon receiving when making their arrangements as to therate of interest they should charge to Fishermen^ Societies.    Itis proposed to hold an informal Conference with Officers of theTreasury and the Development Commissioners with the object ofarriving at a satisfactory solution.Sale of Herrings, mackerel and sprats,    The Board havesuggested&apos; to the Ministry of Food, witii a view to the widerdistribution of these fish that Retailers should be allowed to sellthese fish without the necessity of obtaining a licence under theFish (Registration of Dealers) Order.Permit Section.47 permits have been issued to fishing vessels and 79cancelled.Fishermen&apos;8 Registration and Recruiting Section.Fishermen and Na^al Service.

Twenty more soldiers have arrived on the Colony andwill be.of considerable assistance.   Six&apos; gangs have been at worklifting and clamping potatoes, and with fair weather the workj      should proceed apace,IHeath Hill,   The potato lifting which has been engaging allhands is now&quot; approaching completion, 23 acres having been clampedthis week, making a total of 63 acres now lifted, leaving 7 acresto raise and in addition the &quot;harrowings&quot; on the whole acreage.
239Tithe, Copyhold. Coi/anone and Survey Branch.&quot;:.any enquiries as to the ooat of redemption of titherentcharge, the procedure in Altered Apportionment of titherentcharge, and the    cost of enfranchisement of copyhold landswere received and dealt with.Various proposals for theanenrtment of the Tithe Bill,including some from the Titheo^-mere1 Union, have &quot;been receivedand oon3idered, and various statistics and memoranda bearingupon certain of the amendments to be moved at the CommitteeSta&amp;a of the Bill have been prepared.The normal work of the Bsanch proceeded on linespreviously reported.Kelham Estate.The farming operations are following their normalcourse, corn-drilling, cultivating and manure carting beingin progress.All the potatoes have been lifted, and clamped, withthe exception of 60 tons of &quot;British Queens&quot; which have beensold in the field without labour (apart from lifting) for90/- and 1O0/- per ton, including diseased and chats.   On thex whole the &quot;King Awards&quot; have proved the most successful,yielding a heavy crop of first quality.   The average yieldwill be approximately 8 tons per acre.Analyses have been made of roots from this year&apos;8sugar &quot;beet crop, and arrangements are in hand for lifting.All the live stock is in good condition.   The horsespurchased have worked well, and with few exceptions haveimproved considerably in condition.   It is proposed to purchaseseveral more, at an average price of approximately &quot;105 perhead.Statistical Division.Statistical Branch.   The Branch has been fully occupiedin tabulating the estimates of production of corn and hay;and in preparing returns to be issued to Crop Reporters for theestimates of stocks remaining in farnere&apos; hands on 1stiiOvember.Tables are also being prepared showing production andimports of corn, meat, and feeding stuffs, for the use of theInter-Allied Agricultural Commission.The Linistry of Food have supplied a summary of thestatistics of numbers of live stock collected by then in Junelast.   They have not sent the figures of numbers expected tobe available for slaughter, which it is understood proved to beuseless, and indeed, misleading for the purpose in view.   Atthe conference held here when the form was. discussed, theMinistry of Food1a representatives were warned that foradministrative purposes this return would be disappointing,but they held to their scheme, and so far as this part of thereturn is concerned, farmers have been worried to giveparticulars which have proved to be of very little, if any,practical use.The information as to milk production, thoughprobably not very useful for &quot;food control&quot; purposes, is veryinteresting for statistical purposes, and is being carefully4.
examined..The figures of poultry and goats are also interesting,and will probably be useful to the Ministry in administration.They will be examined in connection with the returns of poultrycollected by the Board in 1908 and 1913.Agricultural Ma^es Board.   The usual fortnightly meetingof the&quot; &quot;ages Board&quot; was held&apos; on the 24th October, preceded bymeetings of various Committees of the Board on the previous day.The Board, having already fixed minimum rates for men, women,boys and girls for practically every county, is mainly concernedat the present time in dealing with the determinations of thevarious District Committees as to the value at which theallowances in kind which they have decided to recognise shallbe reckoned in part payment of minimum wages.   Several of theDistrict Committees have reported on this matter but the Boardare not yet in a position to publish any determinations.*The Board decided to issue Hotice of their Proposalto fix minimum re/tes for boys in Merioneth and Montgomery onthe basis of a recommendation made by the District -JagesCommittee.The Board had under consideration the question cf theexpediency of fixing minimum rates for piece-work in agriculture.After considerable discussion, they decided that it i3 not atpresent expedient to fix such rates,A large amount of correspondence in regard to theeffect of the Boards Orders is being received and dealt with.The decision of.tie Board to fix special rates for workers suchas Horsemen, Stockmen, Shepherds, etc., on the basis of&quot;customary hours&quot; appears to be a cause of difficulty in certaincounties and the Board is now obtaining information from theDistrict Committees in regard to this matter, with a view, ifthought desirable, of defining hourB more specifically.\7ith regard to the work of enforcement of the minimumrates, an additional Inspector, Mr. Henry Harben, has beenappointed, and he entered on his duties on the 21st October,thus increasing the number of outdoor Inspectors to four.   TheseInspectors have been engaged during the last week ininvestigating complaints in Somerset, Devon,     , Essex, Kent,Surrey, the Mugby district and in North Males.   Two cases ofalleged non-payment of the minimum rates have been carried tothe stage of sending a formal letter to the employer concerned,giving him a final opportunity of rectifying the matter byrevising the rates paid and paying the workers all the arrears,before proceedings under the Act are instituted against him.Flax Production Branch.Practically the whole of the crop is now stacked,Five Deseeding Stations are in full operation and several otherswill commence work during the week.   Double shifts will beworked at all Stations as soon as they are completed.   In somecases the night work cannot be carried on owing to the   ElectricLighting being not yet completed.Steady progress is being made with the constructioncf the Factories and the installation of plant for fibreproduction.The main difficulty in the former is the scarcity ofcarpenters, and in the latter of fitters.5,
9&apos;A&apos;iIElJoint Cpnimittee of the Board of Agricultureand the ilnfstry of Pood,Arising out of the propaganda carried out fcjessre withregard to &quot;Parasitic lim&amp;e in Horses&quot; two meetings anddemonstrations as to the cure and prevention of this disease have&quot;been arranged hy the L.C.C. and addressed &quot;by Sir Stewart Stockman.The second of these meetings was addressed &quot;by Sir StewartStoclwian at the Repository, V/hitechapel Road, E.I., on October29th, and was largely attended by London Horse Owners.The establishment of local slaughtering depots nearmarkets far distant from Government Slaughterers still remainsan urgent problem.   Hostile criticisms against the provision ofthe Calves Order are still being received from areas not yetprovided with adequate facilities for slaughter.A general impression exists in agricultural areas thatthe present policy of the Government towards the cattle feedingstuffs problem tends to promote ths interests of Americanagriculture to the detriment of English Agriculture and furthergives direct support to the promotion of American Meat Trustsinterests in this country.   The Joint Committee is of the opinionthat the impression is sufficiently widespread to justify anauthoritative statement of the position.The Deputy Director met in Conference, during the week,the Joint Committee&apos;s   Representatives for &apos;. : Devon and Dorset.Ordnance Survey.During the period ending 29th October 1918, maps weredespatched as follows:-,Far Office..............2,193Admiralty...............10,381Air ministry............11,446Overseas...............141,302Other Services .........   3,569Six members of the Q.K.A.A.C embarked during the weekfor duty at the Overseas Branch.In other respects, the work of the Board proceeds onlines previously indicated.SJ -Secretary..st October, 1918.6.
