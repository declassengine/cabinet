S b. CColonel ft Daily Jones.new:, Copy VSoAppreciation of the Situation, 20th October^ 1910,......................fe((0If    At the present juncture we appear toapproaching the third great crisis of the war.August-September 1914, and again in March-Junefate of the Allied forces on the Western Frontthe balance.     The initiative has now definitely passedfrom tho enemy and has come into the grasp of the AlliedArmies and it only requires a vigorous continuation ofoffensive operations to culminate in final victory.oeIn19in, thehung in2.     Germany is now faced with two imminent andever-increasing dangers(l)   the deterioration of the fighting power ofher armies in the field;(g)   the internal conditions of the country.I.      STATE   tf the   AJOT,3.    The power of the enemy&apos;a armies in tho field tomaintain the struggle depends upon three primary factors:-(a) - Man-power;fo)   Material resources;Moral cohesion.These three factors are so clossly interdependent thatserious deficiency in any one of them mu3t ultimatelybring about a collapse of the military fabric of theGerman Empire.a4.     The surest test of the exhaustion of the-enemy1 areserves of man-power is the rate at which he is forced tore-employ his divisions in battle without adequate restand reorganization.In March 1918, the Germans had collected on theWestern Front a reserve of 80 fresh divisions, and only inexceptional cases wore divisions re-engaged in battlewithout a full month&apos;s rest and training.     At the presentmoment the number of divisions in reserve on the Westernffront has fallen to 50. and during the past month (26thSeptember-23th October! the &quot;roulement&quot; has been so rapidthat the average interval between re-engagements has    -dropped to $ days, thus entirely preventing the systematictraining and reoovery of tho troops.     There are at presentonly 7 divisions out of the line which have had a fort-night&apos; a rest, and not a single one which has had a month.0.     Such a rapid rate of &quot;roulementn might not initself be disastrous were the units to return to linoapproximately up to strength.     In tho last fortnight,however, instances have aotually occurred of Germandivisions on coming into line again on a battle-frontbeing unable to muster a thousand rifles;   the establish-mont of the German division is 6,750 rifles excludingmachine guns.The
2.Tha following few instances may on cited :-(a) -An Order of the 201at Division ongaged ontha British Prent on tho slat September, chewothat tho division was reduced to a fightingstrength of 1,000 riflea.(b) In tha oaao of the 46th RoserY^ divisionwhich come into lino cn tha American Front ontho 14th October, the rifle strength of thedivision was only 795.(e) The lflth Rssorve Division engaged in Octoberen tho British 5ront hud received no draft a ainoethe month of August and roglinonts had boon reducedto two battalions im-toad of three.(&amp;) In 40 or 50 divisions the battaliona haysfre-m reduced from four tt, thrie company baaiaowing to the lack of reinforcements.(e) In tho 54th Division the regimenta had, ontho 3rd October, actually been reduced from $companion to 5.Such a state.of affaire ia all the moraaeriourj when we remember that, during the paat 3 months25 Gorman divisions (226 battalions) have been dio*banded in order to provide drafts Mv the remainder;while, in the last four weeks, five third-rate andill-equipped divisions in Ruaaia have been transferredlo the Western Front.4.     The evidence points to a ahortago of seine3,000 riflea in ovary German division on the WecternFront, i,e* a total shortage on eatabliahment of over550,000 men,     This figure does not aeem unreasonablewhen we conaider that, on our normal baaia of calsula-tion, the enemy&apos;a battle casualties on the WesternFront since lat January 1913 have ulroady amounted tonearly 2i million,, gross (1 million permanent),According to the calculation   of the Supreme WarCouncil (S.V.C.32&amp; cf 4th October), the reserves inthe German depot a on tha lat November will amount onlytc 337,000, including the greater portion of the 1920f i o &apos;...   . Jb&apos;-&apos;   &apos;7.    At the beginning of Septe&amp;b-er, an Orderissued by Ludendorff laid down that the 1920&quot;*Clasu;,i.e. the recruitj averaging 18-j- years of age, waa&apos;natto be employed in tho front line until further orders.(Phia Order was apparently issued an politioal andeconomio grounds.    The German Authorities wore fullyaware that by engaging the 1920 Claaa in the frontline they would be throwing their last oard on to thetable, and that they would bo consuming their finalascot in tha way of man-power.     Apart from the pointof view of the war, the absorption and wastage of tho1920 Claaij ia bound to involve serious consequencesto

Tho strength of unitshas fallen to sueh a low ebb that the 1020 Class isnow being drafted in considerable batones to makegood tho losses incurred in the front line.Germany hus, therefore, been forced to employhor last reservo of oapitul beforo the termination ofthi;:; yoar&apos;s campaign.     The measure of her exhaustioncan bo approximately gauged from thi.; fact alone,R*    Tho enemy&apos;o situation as regard,.; materialresources appears to be equally serious.     Of the &apos;18,000 guns of all calibre;; in aotion on tho Westerni?ront on the 15th July, it is reckoned that tho enomyhas lost 33$ in battle casualties clone since thatdate    Owing to the changes in rat torn involved bytho double rearmament of hi:; artillery during thepast two years, the enemy has apparently been unableto build up a reserve adequate to meet this wastage,documents captured recently Dhow that heavy batteriesin gonoral have had to bo reduced from 4 to 3 guns;in tho case of 21 cm,howitzer?; tc 2 par battery,Division;; arriving this month from the Russian Jronthave had to be thrown into the battle unprovided witheither artillery, trench mortars, or light machineguns.     The comparatively feeble reply to our artilleryfire, and the decreasing activity of the enemy1s air-craft, arc further indications of his deficiency inmaterial resources.9*     ihQ ^r^an armies on the tfe ,torn tfront stilloppo;o our advance with vigour and courage especiallyon those vulnerable sectors where we have piercedtheir last lines of defenoo and arc consequentlywithin striking distance of their vitals;   it isovidont indeed that tho enemy is now fighting withthe energy of despair.    A largo number of capturedOrders convey threats und appeals against cowardiceand ill-discipline from which may be inferred that themorale of the troops is becoming seriously affected.m Army in which the rot has sat in to such an extentas this can no longer be able to stand the continueAstrain of severe fighting and, the flagging disciplinewhich once formed the strongest and most reliablebulwark of the German army, is now within an ace ofbreaking down.10.     To sum up;   it may bo said that the enemy isnow bankrupt as regards the man-power and materialnone ;sary for protracting the struggle much longer,only the inherent military spirit of his troops andthe national discipline inculcated in the Gornan,enable

BetweenValenciennes and tho River Sorre no natural obstacleeither in tha shape of ground or water-line is avail-able to carve as a razapart for tho weakening Germanaritdoo.    !lore the British Arsiy has, driven athreatening wedge through th&amp; r, tout oat of the Germandefence,;;, and now uu&amp;aoos the energy&apos;s &amp;uin urtory ofooiasaUjtticution.    The Valley of the Affibra and theConde Hons Canal lead from the present battlefielddirectly to Hamur, the strategic centre of the Westernffront.     Here the enemy has massed the elite, ao trollao the bulk of his forces, but they are in process ofbeing steadily beaten by the tireless efforts of theBritish Amy.     The enemy is weakening rapidly, andhis vital centre at Hanur is now uncovered.A continuation of our efforts in this directioncan hardly fail to culminate in a crushing militaryvictory.11.    When we turn from the armies in the fieldto the Gorman Home Pront, wo find still worse condi-tions in existonee.    The discipline of the Gormannation has always been notorious, and characterisesthe civilian population no less than it doeg therigidly drilled Gentian Army.Backed up by a subservient and well-controlledPress, the German Authorities have, from the beginningof the War, carefully nurtured the eitiliuli morale onthe fruits, as well au on tho promiae, of victory.Tho orushing victories which Gomany has boon able toinflict on the outlying and weaker nations which haveallied themselves to the intents Poworo, engendered aspirit of complete confidence- in the military chiefsand in tho invinciVlo power of the Goraian militarymachine.12.     On but few occasions during the war have thedissentient voices made themselves heard above theuniversal confidence in victory.     In July 1917, theMajority Group of tho Reichstag ventured to express atentative desire for the termination of the struggleJ-while in January 1918, the continued and really seriousprivations endured by the civil population culminatedin widely spread strikes on the part of the workingclasses.    The national morale was, hewevor. stillrcoundj the strikes wore oa ily suppressed; the GermanNation tightened its bolt another hole heartened by thehints thrown out by tho Higher Goim-nd of a great andfinal offensive which would culminate in decisivevictory.
5.13,     Buoyed up by those hopos which, however, didnot materially alleviate its privations, tho Germanpooplo witnessed with fortitude the otaadily mountingcasualty rolls during the months of April, Hay and)Juno.     Tho length of those casualty lists was for-gotten in tho triumphant progress of the German Armiesand in the prospect of speedy victory.The middle of July, howevor, saw the turn of thstide, and the decline in the Gorman morale at homefaithfully reflected tho ebb of Germany&apos;e militaryfortunes on the Western Front,14*     Tho fighting of the last month fcao shut cutthese hopes of victory, and an indifferent harvest hasnot conduced to a cheerful endurance of tho aver-increasing difficulties of economic life.     The mannerin which Germany    rulers have forfeited the respectand the consideration of the civilized world haveincreased the depression in the case of large sectionsof the population whose future,is dependent onGermany&apos;a economic and financial relations with thoouter world after tho war.15*     In addition to the severe economic privationsinflicted by the blockade and tho threat of disaster intho field, the populous districts of tho Rhine Valleyand y:ostern Germany have had the war brought vigorouslyhomo to thorn by tho continued and successful oporationsof the Independent nir Porce,     Thore is no doubt that&quot;this factor alone has had a powerful influence inshattering the morale of the German Nation, as well asmaterially affecting tho productive powers of Germany&apos;swar industries.16.     A measure of tho despairing condition of thicivil population is afforded by the extent to which thePress has been recently unmuzzled, whor-i in former dayssubservient journalists had nothing but flattery andpraise for everything connected with the Higher Commandand the conduct of&quot;the war.     Bitter criticism is nowfrequently directed at the Government, the militarychiefs, and oven at tho Sovereign himself.The breakdown&quot;of tho morale of the German nationat home is talcing place ?pari passuf with the moraland material defeat of the German armies in the field.General Staff, (Signed) 0.11*Harrington,T.7ar Office, Kajor-Gonoral,26th 0otr,191ff. for G*I.G.3.
