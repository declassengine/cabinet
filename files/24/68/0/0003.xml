THIS; DCG JI.1ENT 13 THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY^S GOVERIMSNT,SECRET. WAR CABINET.G.T. 6103.     ALTERNATIVE FEMSIOtiS OF OFFICER^1&apos; WIDOWS **1 Merorandum \,y ftha Minister of Pensions.!1.     In paragraph 11 of my memorandum of the 3rd October,xrelative to &quot;the pensions of widows of former ware, I mentioned^*      that a proposal was Kefore the Treasury for increasing the ratifon which the alternative pensions of officers&apos; widows areassessed,   A letter has since been received from the Treasuryrefusing this proposal fcr the second time except on thecondition   that the pensions shall be subject to the conditionsthat the widow&apos;s total means do not exceed a specified amount.I am not prepared to eccept that condition and request that thomatter may be considered and decided fey the War Cabinet,2.     The Warrants of 1917 for both officers and merfprescribedthat a widpw might be granted a pension equal tc half theamount of the alternative pension which would have been awardedto her husband if totally disabled.     The Warrant ofApril 17th,1918, revising the Warrant for men, amended the ratiofor men&apos;s widows to two-thirds of the abp.ve amount.     At aconference on the 14th June, at which DrtMaonamara, Mr, Forster,and Mr. Baldwin were present, the question of raising the basisin the case of officers1 widows to two-thirds was considered,and it was agreed that it was logical and would not cost Verymuch.     The proposal was submitted to the Treasury, but approvedb  them only on the condition   I have mentioned *     It has againbeon pressed, but they have once more rejected it,3.     I, would wish to urge the following considerations:^(lj It is the essence of alternative pensions that theyare based on pre-war earnings, and the suggested conditionis alien to the principle of alternative pensions.     Therecan be no logical reason for taking account of income in ;some ranks and not in others, or in regard to alternativemore than flat-rate pensions,.     To follow the recentconcession to a certain point a..ii restrict its effect with .a disabling qualification would invite criticism as a pieceof class legislation,(2) To illustrate the unfairness of the present position:-(a) A Chief Gunner and a Seaman were each earning  100a year before the war,     The widow of the former getsa pension of  50, if the latter  66.13. 4.(b) A Sergeant and a Captain were both earning  200&apos; ayear before the war. ,   The Sergeant&apos;s widow gets  110,the Captain1s  100.(3) The financial cost of my proposal would not, 1 believe,be serious.     The current expenditure&apos;on alternativepensions of widows/officers and.Naval Warrant Officersis  15,033 a year;    on a two-third basis this would beincreased to  20,044 a year, or an annual increase of . 5,011., * In addition a certain number of cases will occur where thetwo-thirds basis will render widows eligible for alternativeX pensions who hitherto were eligible only for the flat-rate.pension, e.g. the widow of a Captain earning  200 a year, nowgets flat-rate pension of  100 a year.     On the two-thirds basisshe will be eligible for an alternative pension of  135. 6. 8a year,     It is not possible to estimate the cost resulting fromthe admission of this new class *(4) The financial saving under the Treasury&apos;s proposal wouldprobably
probably not be considerable.     It is probable that awell-to-do officer would either- be a man of private means,relying little, if at all, on earned income in which case noclaim to alternative pension would arisej   or he would be aprofessional man relying almost entirely cn hie,earnings, inwhich case it is just that his widow should have the fullbenefit of his earnings and also less likely that she wouldbe affected by an income limit.(5) ht the same time, the means limits would involve agood deal of extra administrative trouble,&quot; I am told thatthis is the experience of those who have had to deal with&quot;ordinary&quot; pensions .at the &apos;.&quot;sr Office.    There is theexamination in detail of the widow&apos;s -declaration as to thevarious items of.her income and correspondence about doubtfulitems, re-examination and further correspondence whenever aborderline case reinvests or has an access of income, extrawork for the Paymaster General in watching and reportingfluctuations of income, a gradual accumulation of case-lawas to what constitutes &quot;means&quot; , and so forth.4.     On all these grounds I request the authority&apos;of theWar Cabinet to amend the regulations so that the widows ofofficers end naval warrant officers may hove- theiralternative pensions assessed on the same basis as lowerranks without any condition   as to private meaTts.(Intd.)   J.H.Ministry of Pensions.October 23rd. 1918.
