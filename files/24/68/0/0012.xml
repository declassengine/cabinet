During aerial fighting 12 enemy machines were destroyedand five driven down out of control.  Nine of our machines are missing.On 18th October some of our machines from Mudros carried out a raid on Constanti- Mediter-nople, and dropped nearly a ton of bombs on the town and military objectives, causing ranean.much damage.

Two officers were killed and nine men wounded.A Coastal Motor Boat belonging to the Dover Force is missing and is presumed tohave been sunk owing to heavy seas. The bodies of three out of the crew of five havebeen recovered.ATTACK UPON ENEMY SUBMARINES.During the week under review 18 large enemy submarines of a type which operates Submarinesfurther afield than the North Sea, were located, included in this number being four of the operating.&quot; cruiser &quot; type, one of which was to the south-west of Ireland, homeward-bound; oneoperating in the vicinity of the Azores, and two were slowly moving eastwards from NorthAmerica towards the Azores. The remaining large boats were mainly operating to thenorth of Ireland, in the Irish Sea and to the westward of the Bay of Biscay, the two latterareas and the Mediterranean being the chief spheres of activity. The East Coast ofEngland was again quiet.JC 1472)   Wt,  -   50   10/18   H &amp; S A

ENEMY MINES.Minelaying. No new groups of enemy mines have been located in British mine-sweeping areasduring the week under review, but there are indications that further mines, probably 36,have been laid eastward of the Firth of Forth, one of H.M. ships having cut a minewith lier paravane on the 19th instant, and the locality is being searched.The work of clearing the approaches to Ostend commenced on the 19th instant, and itsoon became apparent that the enemy defensive mine has different characteristics fromhis offensive type. The defensive mines have a considerably thicker mooring rope, andare laid with fixed moorings of such a length that at high water they are only verylittle below the surface, and consequently they show on the surface for some time nearlow water. The thicker moorings at first parted the sweeping wire of the Tunnel Mine-sweepers, which were being employed on account of their very shallow draft, but largersize sweeping wire was at once despatched, and motor launches were employed to sink themines on the surface.  The situation is now well in hand.Casualties.        r^ne following Table shows the number of enemy mines destroyed in British mine-sweeping areas and of British vessels sunk by mine in recent weeks : 	Number of Enemy				Moored Mines			Week Ended.

No enemy ships have entered or leftRotterdam.,FOREIGN NAVAL INTELLIGENCE.Feance.The French Government are about to create a Naval Base at Beirut. This has beendecided with a view to providing an independent line of communication for the Frenchdetachment operating in Syria.Spain.The Government have requisitioned seven German steamers at present interned inSpanish ports, to replace those sunk since August 14th, the date of the Spanish Note toGermany.  The total tonnage of the vessels requisitioned amounts to 21,000 tons.It is not clear on what conditions these vessels have been taken over, but it is unlikelythat the Spanish Government will be willing to allow them to revert to Germany at theend of the war. Although the German Government endeavour to make the transactionappear voluntary, it has created a very bad impression in Germany, and has impairedtheir prestige in Spain.
Russia.From Archangel General Poole reports that he estimates between 2,000 and 3,000&quot;enemy forces to be in the region of Kotlas. They have several guns mounted on river craft,but it is expected that operations on the Dwina will shortly be plosed, and transport^difficulties should prevent any serious land operation by this force as soon as the frost setsin. A strong enemy attack down the River Dwina, backed by several armed vessels andby shell fire from heavy guns, has compelled our troops to withdraw about 8 miles towardsthe confluence of the River Vaga with the Dwina, and they were obliged, to abandon four18-pdr. guns and some machine guns after being rendered uselebS. The enemy ispressing his attack and we may have to retreat further, but reinforcements are beingsent up and.General Poole is confident that the base at the confluence of the Vaga andDwina can be held.In the Archangel-Vologda railway area the enemy is on the defensive, but is de-moralised. Owing, however, to the set-back on the Dwina, operations have beentemporarily stopped.Arrangements have been made by General Poole to patrol the Onega-Soroka road,which follows the southern shore of the White Sea.The Germans have fully manned five of the large oil-burning destroyers of the RussianBlack Sea Fleet, and on the 19th instant they were reported to be at Constantinople. Inaddition to these the Dreadnought Battleship &quot; Volya &quot; is partly manned with Germanpersonnel, and the remainder of the crew are expected from Germany? She is otherwiseready for use.The Germans have also taken over, but not yet manned, the Pre-Dreadnought Battle-ships &quot; Efstafi &quot; and &quot; Ioann Zlatoust,&quot; and the cruiser &quot; Pamyat Merkuriya.&quot; TheDreadnought Battleship &quot; Imperatritza Maria &quot; which was sunk by an explosion inOctober, 1916, has been raised, but repairs cannot be carried out owing to the lack oflabour.The arming of merchant ships in the Caspian for Allied service proceeds satisfactorily.Up to the 19th October one steamer was ready at Bnzeli and another at Krasnovodsk.A third ship is to carry out her gun trials on 21st October at Enzeli, and a fourth atKrasnovodsk expects to complete about the 28th October.JSfaval Staff.2ith October, 1918.[Appendix.
