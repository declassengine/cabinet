J. A. Salter.Summary and Index of Report.General Tonnage Position.  (Paragraph 1.)In the first nine months of this year the losses of the three European Alliesexceeded building by 1,133,000 tons deadweight, while American building exceededAmerican losses by 1,845,000 deadweight. This excess in American buildingover losses, however, is much less than what is required to meet the increasedrequirements of the American Army, and it has been necessary to allot 200,000 tonsat the expense of European imports to the American supply programme for Octoberloading. The European Allies have about 2 million tons deadweight less for theirown services than a year ago.Italian Coal.

2Other Tonnage Arrangements (Paragraph 7.)(a) A scheme is under consideration for the more economical use of cargo spaceon vessels engaged on the American Army Supply Programme.   The continuation ofA,light American cargo with heavy French munitions is expected to effect a net savin/of about 50,000 tons deadweight a month, equivalent to 125,000 tons deadweightcontinuously employed in the N. Atlantic.(6) An amended proposal for the employment of sailing tonnage south of: the lineis under examination.(c) Emergency shipments of wool for Italy have been arranged.(d) Additional timber requirements for the American army in France have beenconsidered and dealt with.Allied Programmes.

General Tonnage Position.The general shipping position is shown in the following statement of the lossesand new building of vessels in the first nine months of the year : 	European Allies (Great Britain, France, Italy).	United States.	The Allies.	Neutrals,Losses (all causes)    -Gains (building and miscellaneous)   -	Deadweight Tonnage. 3,029,000 1,896,000	Deadweight Tonnage. 328,000 2,173,000	Deadweight Tonnage. 265,000 596,000	Deadweight&apos; Tonnage. 425,000 194,000Net loss or gain -     -     -     -	-1,133,000	1,845,000	4-331,000	-231,000During the period, therefore, America has built a little over If million tons dead-weight more than she has lost, while the European Allies have lost a little over1 million tons deadweight more than they have built. The excess of Americanbuilding over losses is, however, much less than the extra tonnage required for theincreased Army requirements, and it has been necessary to allot 200,000 tons forOctober loading.II. Italian Goal.The coal dispatched to Italy in the period September 15 October 14 was asfollows :  	Place.	Execution.Shipments of British Coal by Long Sea route British Coal passing Italian frontier                              -     -French Coal passing Italian frontier   -      -      -      -      -      -      -French Coal on board at Mediterranean ports     -      -	Ions. 150,000 100,000 J   350,000 J	Tons. 289,492 88,137 91,335 93,971	600,000	562,936The stocks of British coal at the Gironde Ports waiting.to be railed to Italyamounted on October 10th to 32,388 tons.The deficit of 41,633 tons carried forward from previous months has unfortunatelybeen increased to 78,698 tons. This has been due to a further decrease in therailings of French coal, which for the month in question amount to only 185,306 tons
3as compared with the programme of 350,000 tons a month, and with previous railingsof about 230,000 tons a month. The further reduction is most serious, and someimprovement appears essential if the Italian coal supply is to be maintained at600,000 tons a month.The September shipments amounted to 1,604,260 tons, a deficit of 135,740 tons onthe provisional programme of 1,740,000 tons.The arrangements for meeting the tonnage requirements of the Belgian Reliefare working satisfactorily. So far as can be foreseen and unless special difficultiesarise (such as the recent strike at Rotterdam) the tonnage in view up to the end of1918 should be sufficient.(a) During September 228,088 American troops were embarked, of whom 115,780were carried in British tonnage, 98,562 in American, 7,951 in French, and 5,795 inItalian.Allocations of British Vessels to Allies.(o) 200,000 tons have been allocated for the American Army supply service forOctober loading.(c) Liner Services U.S.A. to France. It was originally arranged that about102,000 tons would be available for the French Government in October (see lastReport), but owing to the decision to transfer 50,000 tons to the American Armysupply, the balance of 52,000 tons only will be at the disposal of the French.As regards November 50,000 tons has been provisionally agreed.(d) Liner Services U.S.A. to Italy.The figures given in the last Report have since been subject to adjustment.September shows a loading of 37,758 tons; compensation being afforded inOctober loadings, which amount to 101,427 tons. The forecast for November is29,198 tons.(e) Sugar. Three cargoes of Sugar amounting to 20,693 tons have been divertedto France since the last Report.(/) Cereals. In September 218,000 tons have been diverted to France, and133,000 tons to Italy.(g) Wagon. A total number of 5,782 railway wagons have now been despatchedfrom this country out of the 10,000 agreed upon to be allocated to Italy.In the period covered since the last Report a further 16 vessels have come intothe pool of neutral tonnage under direction of the Allied Maritime Transport Council.The total number of vessels which have come under this scheme is 187, with adeadweight of 498,496 tons. Of these, 7 vessels of 23,040 tons deadweight have beenlost, leaving 475,456 tons deadweight now in the Pool. Among these vessels 269allocations and re-allocations have taken place.The following statement shows approximately how on the 16th October the Pooltonnage was employed in accordance with the working plan adopted by the executive.Coal to France      -     -     -     -     - - - - 115,122Coal to Italy (a) ToBlaye -     -     -     -     - - - - 60,713(6) To Italy (ore home)  -     -.    - - - - 55,002(c) Mediterranean Trade (France/Italy) - - - 10,990III.

(b) Danish Tonnage Agreement.A number of Danish vessels, aggregating 56,000 tons deadweight, have been,working for Italy under voyage charter with the Danish owners. As a result of theDanish Agreement these vessels will eventually come into the Allied Pool, and byarrangement with the U.S.A. authorities they are to be reckoned as part of the Britishshare under the Agreement.With the approval of the Tonnage Committee these vessels have been left inItalian service for the immediate voyages to Italy.VII (a). Co-operative Use of Allied Cargo Space in North Atlantic.An exceptionally good example of the economy which can be effected bycombining Allied programmes has been afforded by the arrangements made to loadFrench Steel in vessels bringing American Army Supplies.The executive were confronted with the fact that the American Army SuppliesProgramme, as presented by Mr. Baker, included a very high proportion of lightmeasurement cargo, with the consequence that if this programme were dealt withseparately the vessels would necessarily sail full but light, i.e., well above theirmarks; while, on the other hand, the new French Munition Programme included avery high proportion of heavy deadweight cargo such as steel and rails, and ifdealt with alone would involve vessels sailing down to their marks but with theirspace only partially full.Arrangements are therefore being made for the American Government to load150,000 tons of FYench Steel a month (instead of only about 35,000 tons aspreviously), while extra British ships are allotted to compensate for the compara-tively small proportion of space thus lost for American Supplies, and for certainextra time taken in loading, discharging, &amp;c. This arrangement, if successfully carriedout, should result in a net saving of about 50,000 tons a month, which is equivalentto the continuous employment of about. 125,000 tons deadweight of shipping in theNorth Atlantic.(b) Use of Sailing Tonnage.With reference to the scheme for the employment of sailing tonnage describedin the previous report (August 16th-September 15th), it was subsequently foundnecessary to modify the original proposals in consequence of the inflammable natureof South African coal, and its unsuitability for carriage in sailing vessels. Theattention of the Tonnage Committee was drawn to recent cases of vessels on fire atsea with this coal on board. A revised plan has therefore been proposed and agreed,on the following lines : (1) Chili to South Africa with nitrates ; South Africa to Australia in ballast, orwith such cargo as may be offering (e.g., maize, wattle-bark); Australia to Chili withcoal.(2) Australia to Chili with coal (or to Peru with wheat and thence to a nitrateport); Chili with nitrates (a) to Pacific coast of North America, or (6) to Atlanticcoast of North America; thence to Australia with cargo according to North Americanloading port.(3) Australia to Plate with coal; Plate to the States with linseed (or from Brazilwith other cargo, also in some cases from Plate, &amp;c, to Canada); United States (orCanada) to Australia with general cargo, lumber oil, &amp;c.(4) Australia to South Africa with sleepers, flour, &amp;c, and back to Australia(either in ballast or with such cargo as may be suitable). This plan which is beingput into operation as quickly as possible is subject to the extent to which the UnitedStates Government might have to replace with sailing or auxiliary tonnage the steamtonnage taken from coastal traffic for overseas work.----- (c) Wool for the Italian Army.The present demands of Italy for at least 10,000 tons of wool during the remainingmonths of the year have been considered. This requirement relates to military needs,and could in present circumstances be considered only on the basis of an emergencydemand and&apos; dealt with as such.
U \$ j To meet Italy&apos;s need the following steps have been taken ;-(1) British vessels have been allocated to lift all the available wool in SouthAfrica for immediate shipment to Italy; this is understood to amountto rather more than 2,000 tons.(2) It has been agreed that Italy may ship at the expense of cereals, up to5,000 tons of wool from the Argentine, which will be carried in Britishships.  It is hoped that finance will shortly be arranged for this wool.Wool from Australia for Italy and France is normally brought in British Linersto Port Said, and there transhipped.   The Italian wool now coming forward in thisway will be dealt with as quickly as possible at Port Said, and efforts are beingmade to arrange for some part at any rate of the stock of wool (amounting to2,644 tons) now held by the French at Port Said to be handed over for Italian use.id) American Army Timber Requirements in France.The Executive received an urgent demand from the United States ArmyAuthorities for the transport of an additional 10,000 standards of timber a monthinto France. This demand was put forward by the Chairman of the TimberProgramme Committee as one which had to be met, and failing an increase in theproduction of timber in France, it could only he met by an allocation of furthertonnage in the Scandinavian trade to the carriage of timber.The United States Army Authorities had originally proposed to endeavour tocharter free neutral tonnage for the purpose, but it was agreed that this was notpracticable and would certainly interfere seriously with the working of the SwedishAgreement.In these circumstances negotiations were entered into with the British TimberController, who agreed to meet the United States Army demand provided that hewas assured a minimum of 10,000 standards a month from Norway and 18,000 standardsa month from Sweden.The shipping difficulty with regard to Sweden is that it is the one countryto which non-national tonnage cannot, for naval considerations, be sent, while theimpossibility was at the same time recognised of relying upon getting Swedishtonnage in excess of the 60,000 tons a month which Sweden is under obligation toprovide. To meet the Timber Controller^ demands would mean the allocation totimber of 54,000 tons out of this 60,000. Subject to the justification of the Americandemand by the Timber Programme Committee, and seeing that either the undertakingrequired by the Timber Controller had to he given or the shipping advantagesgained by the Swedish agreement lose, the Tonnage Committee decided to approvethe Ministry of Shipping giving the undertaking requested by the Timber Controller,as this seemed the only practicable solution apart from the possibility of obtainingthe timber in France.VIII. Allied Programmes.(a) Food.The Tonnage Committee, in conjunction with the Freight Committee of theFood Council, have been engaged upon the Allied Food Programme for the firstfour months of the cereal year 1018-19 (i.e., the four months ending 31st December1918). &apos;The necessary connection between the two Committees has been effected byMr. Hurcomb, a member of the Freight Committee, becoming a member of theTonnage Committee.As a result of considerable discussion, a programme for the four months hasbeen produced which may be regarded as workable from a tonnage point of view, andhas been accepted by the Tonnage Committee.This programme reflects principles governing the distribution of tonnage during,the period which the Tonnage Committee decided were essential to the properAvorking of Allied tonnage. From the point of view of the allocation of tonnagebetween the Allies, it may be observed that the programme involves the transferenceof 50,000 tons of oil seeds from Great Britain to France, with a correspondingincrease of 50,000 tons in British Cereals, and an adjusting decrease of 50,000 tonsin French cereals.o  AS 0532
0The food programme is, of course, now in process of execution, the variousshipping departments making necessary adjustments in detail from time to time.*(b) Munitions.The Executive has received the programme for the United Kingdom for thesix months October 1918/March 1919 ; the full programmes for France and Italyhave not yet been received.The chief difficulty in relation to this programme arises from the very largeincreases foreshadowed in the demands for France. Apart from the difficulty ofproviding the necessary tonnage there is the acute problem of the French ports.The present state of these ports and the delays already occurring make it a matterof great doubt whether they can handle the large increases in heavy cargoes con-templated in the munitions programme ; this question is receiving the closestattention of the Executive.However, pending receipt of the full programme and the result of the investiga-tion into the capacity of the French, ports, steps are being taken which should enablethe requirements to be covered to a large extent. The most important action taken inthis respect is the arrangement now under discussion with the United States Authorities,whereby the maximum amount of deadweight cargo for France will be carried inAmerican, ships in conjunction with military supplies. It is hoped by this method,which is more fully described in paragraph VII. (a), to lift as much as 150,000 tonsa month of heavy French cargo.APPENDICES.(a) Letter from the Transport Council to the Food Council.(b) Reply of Food Council.(c) Letter from the Transport Council to the Munitions Council.(a) Letter from Transport Council to Food Council.Sir, 4th October 1918.I am directed by the Allied Maritime Transport Council to inform you that attheir recent session they had under further consideration the policy which shouldgovern the disposition of tonnage betAveen the various competing services for thecereal year 1918-19.In view of the fact that the allocation of tonnage is mainly a question of thecompeting demands of food on the one hand and munitions and army supplies on theother, the range of possible variation in the needs of other services being compara-tively limited, the Transport Council are anxious to put the fullest possible informationas to the shipping position, and as to the reasons which have in fluenced them in theirdecisions before the Food Council and the Munitions Council.For this purpose I am to enclose for your information a copy of the Report* of theAllied Maritime Transport Executive to the Council in which a general statement ofthe tonnage position is given, together with the principal grounds of the severalrecommendations.In view of the position there disclosed the Council arrived at the followingdecisions affecting the food programme subject to the covering assent of the respectiveGovernments: (1) That during the later Autumn and Winter a general preference should begiven to the transport of munitions and army supplies as compared withfood.(2) That when necessary, but as late as possible without runniug undue risk oiactual shortage of food, a similar preference should be given to thetransport of food in the spring or early summer.(3) That in view of the prospect of substantial improvement in the whole Alliedtonnage position by next summer, and in order to avoid reducing the sliip-ment of essential commodities required for actual consumption during the* The Report is printed as Appendix 32 in the Minutes of the Fourth Session,
2057year (particularly munitions), all Supply Departments should be asked toeffect a reduction of stocks until they approximate towards the end ofAugust to the quantities required for actual distribution.(4) That .18&apos; 5 million tons of importations of all articles included in the foodprogramme except military oats should be confirmed as the figure for theyear.(5) That if the food position at the end of the winter or later shows such a courseto be necessary in order to avoid food shortage, food shipments shouldhave priority in excess of the proportion due on the 18&apos; 5 basis at theexpense of tonnage allotted to other services.(6) That for the purpose of considering the tonnage available for other servicesthe total importations of food (and all other articles included in the foodprogramme including all miscellaneous foodstuffs and military oats) shouldbe provisionally estimated at 22 million tons.The Council requests that these decisions should he read in conjunction with theexplantory notes on pages 4 and 5 of the enclosed memorandum^With regard to military oats, the Council felt unable, in the absence of furtherinformation, to specify any exact figure for this year&apos;s programme.The Executive reported to the Council that in their view it would be necessary tocontemplate an importation of 900,000 to 1,000,000 tons in the four months Septemberto December inclusive, instead of 750,000 tons previously mentioned, and the Councilauthorised the Executive to arrange for a corresponding allocation of tonnage.I am to request that you will take this decision as modifying my letter ofSeptember 6th with regard to military oats.I am to observe that the Council are anxious that the importations should, ifpracticable, be kept down to the lower figure of 900,000 tons, and to add that theExecutive would prefer to await the report on the military oats position of the FoodCommittee&apos;s representative who is going to France for the purpose, before giving afinal figure.I should add that this figure relates solely to the period of four months ending31st December and is not intended to imply anything as to the rate of importationsfor later months, as to which no decision is possible until the receipt of the furtherinformation now being awaited.In addition to the decisions given directly in relation to the food programmecertain decisions given in relation to munitions and the American Army Supply alsoaffect food importations and will therefore be of interest to your Committee.The munitions programme which originally amounted to 22f million tons was firstreduced to 19 million tons, and in view of the fact that considerable reductions weremade in the proposed importations of nitrates from the distant source of Chile, it wasconsidered that the figure for the total importations of food and munitions can beraised from the 39&apos; 8 as stated in the memorandum to 40 million tons, thus leaving18 million tons for munitions on the assumption that food would be limited to22 million tons, and that taking the cereal year as a whole the arrangements withAmerica would not involve any net loss of imports.On this basis the Munitions Council proposed that in the next six months(October to March inclusive) munitions should import 10 million tons, leaving8 million tons for the other six months (September and April to August).The Council accepted, however, the advice of the Executive to the effect that itwas not practicable to fix any definite figure and that their instructions should beconfined to working as far as was found practicable in the next six months towardsimportations of munitions in priority over food, while in the immediate future givingspecial priority in loading to any classes of munitions which theMunitions Councilregard as specially urgent and important.The Council also had before them representations from, the Italian Government tothe effect that the capacity of the Italian ports is so limited that Italy is not in aposition to distribute imports in uneven quantities over the different months. In thesecircumstances the Council approved a recommendation of the Executive that shipmentsshould be so adjusted as between food and munitions as to keep importations as even aspossible in Italy throughout the year, shortages in munitions ready for shipment at anytime being compensated for by increased shipments of food, &amp;c. so far as may&apos; bedesirable for the above reasons. This decision may occasionally involve the shipmentof food to Italy instead of munitions when the latter are not available, but such an* i.c, Appendix 32 of Minutes of Fourth Session.......&apos; A i
8arrangement would, of course, only be made when there was a reasonable prospect ofthe Italian ports being able to deal with such shipments without undue delay.The Committee of Representatives has already been informed of the arrangementto provide 200,000 tons of shipping space for loading by the end of October for theAmerican Army Supply services and of the effect of this arrangement upon theshipments of food.I have to inform you that the Council decided that further tonnage should beprovided for the same services. for loading in November and December, a total of300,000 tons in these two months being mentioned as the quantity contemplated. Itwas, however, decided that this figure should be subject to further consideration inthe light of additional information now &quot;being obtained as to the immediate needs ofthe American Army in relation to the competing needs of other services, and a furthercommunication will be made to you on the subject.In conclusion, I am to ask that your Committee give their earnest considerationto the general tonnage position as described in the enclosed memorandum and will,in particular, take every possible step to avoid the necessity of importations in excessof the standard figures of 18 &quot;5 millions or 22 millions including military oats andsundries, in view of the extremely serious effect of any such excess upon other services,in particular the importations of munitions and the American Army Supply Service.J. A. SALTER.(b) Letter from Food Council to Transport Council.Sir, -( 14th October 1918.I am directed by the Committee of Representatives of the Inter-Allied FoodCouncil to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 4th October, referring to thedecisions which were taken at the recent session of the Allied Maritime TransportCouncil.I am to state that the Committee of Representatives fully accept the decision thata general preference should be given to the transport of munitions and Army Suppliesduring the next few months, subject to a preference being given to the transport offood for the rest of the cereal year. It is essential that the preference for food shouldbe given sufficiently early to obviate undue risk of a shortage of food and that thepossibility of shipping increased amounts through the American ports be kept inmind. The Committee adhere to the principle that in order to reduce presentimportation, recourse should be had to stocks to such an extent as may be reasonablysafe.The Committee of Representatives note that the total tonnage available for food-stuffs and military oats is provisionally estimated at 22 million tons. While theyagree to proceed on this basis in the first instance, they desire to place on recordtheir view that on present estimates it appears clear that it will be necessary to assignadditional tonnage to the carriage of foodstuffs in the last six months of the presentcereal year.The provisional allocation of tonnage assigned to the transport of military oatshas been noted, and I am directed to inform you that the whole position as regardsmilitary oats is being considered at Conferences in Paris at the present time. TheCommittee of Representatives will at once communicate with the Allied MaritimeTransport Council, if, on further investigation, the proposed allocation of 900,000 or1,000,000 tons for this purpose for the first four months of the present cereal year isfound to be insufficient. In the meantime they are communicating this proposedlimitation to the various military authorities with a suggested allocation as betweencountries of the tonnage at present considered available.With regard to the further points mentioned in your letter, the Committee ofRepresentatives note the special features affecting the Italian position, and willendeavour to adjust their programme so as to work in with any general Italianimportation programme that may be arranged.The effect on the Food Programme of the additional allocation made for thetransport of American troops by the end of October next has been noted, and theCommittee of Representatives desire me to state that, while fully sympathising withthe proposals to increase the allocation of tonnage to the American Military Programmeduring November and December, they do not feel that it would be safe to meet this byany further reduction in the programme of food importation.Gertrude C. Dixon.
(c) Letter from Transport Council to Munitions Council.Sir, ; 10th October 1918.I am directed by the Allied Maritime Transport Council to acquaint you, forthe information of the Inter-Allied Munitions Council, that at their recent Sessionthey had under further consideration the policy which should govern the dispositionof tonnage between the various competing services for the cereal year 1918-19.In view of the fact that the allocation of tonnage is mainly a question of thecompeting demands of food on the one hand and munitions and army supplies onthe other, the range of possible variation in the needs of other services being eom-paratively limited, the Transport Council are anxious to put the fullest possibleinformation as to the shipping position and as to the reasons which have influencedthem in their decisions, before both the two Councils for Munitions and Food.For this purpose I am to enclose for your information a copy of the report&apos;:i:&apos;of the Allied Maritime Transport Executive to the Council, in which a generalstatement of the tonnage position is given, together with the principal grounds ofthe several recommendations.In view of the position there disclosed the Council arrived at the followingdecisions affecting the Munitions Programme, subject to the covering assent of therespective Governments: (1) That during the later Autumn and Winter a general preference should begiven to the transport of munitions and army supplies as comparedwith food.(2) That when necessary, but as late as possible without running undue riskof actual shortage of food, a similar preference should be given to thetransport of food in the spring or early summer.(3) That in view of the prospect of a substantial improvement in the wholeAllied tonnage position by next Summer, and in order to avoid reducingthe shipment of essential commodities required for actual consumptionduring the year (particularly munitions), all Supply Departments shouldbe asked to effect a reduction - of stocks until they approximate, towardsthe end of August, to the quantities required for actual distribution.(4) That in estimating what is available for the European munitions importsit should be provisionally estimated that any tonnage assistance renderedto America, whether by the allocation of ships or the supply of artillery,will be returned within the cereal year, thus leaving 18 million tons forEuropean munitions, including ore, pyrites, phosphate rock, railwaymaterial, and lubricating oil, but that it should be recognised that thisrequires reconsideration after the examination of the Munitions Programme,and, in particular, of the arrangements there proposed for supplies tothe American Forces.The Council requests that these decisions should be read in conjunction withthe explanatory notes on pages 4 and 5 of the enclosed Memorandum^I have to request that you will be good enough to consider the application ofthe principle indicated in resolution (3) above, i.e., the reduction of stocks towardsa minimum towards the end of the cereal year. I am to suggest that this principlewhile, doubtless, applicable to other commodities within the munitions programme,may apply with particular force in the case of nitrates.The Council were informed that the Munitions Programme, which originallyamounted to 22f million tons, had been reduced to 19 million tons, and, in viewof the fact that considerable reductions were made in the proposed importation ofnitrates from the distant source of Chile, it was considered that the figure for thetotal importations of food and munitions could be raised from 39&apos;8 million tons,as stated in the Memorandum, to 40 million tons, thus leaving 18 million tons formunitions, on the assumption that food would be limited to 22 million tons, andthat, taking the cereal year as a whole, the arrangements with America would notinvolve any net loss of imports.On this basis it was proposed by M. Loucheur and Mr. Winston Churchill, onbehalf of the Munitions Council, that in the next six months (October to Marchinclusive) munitions should import 10 million tons, leaving 8 million tons for theother six months (September and April to August).* Appendix 32 of Minutes of Fourth Session.
10The Council accepted, however, the advice of the Executive, to the effect thatit was not practicable to fix any definite figure, and that their instructions shouldbe confined to working, as far as was found practicable, in the next six months,towards importations of munitions in priority over food, while in the immediatefuture giving special priority for the loading of any classes of munitions which theMunitions Council regard as specially urgent and important.The Council also had before them representations from the Italian Governmentto the effect that the capacity of the Italian ports is so limited that Italy is not ina position to distribute imports in uneven quantities over the different months.In these circumstances the Council approved the recommendation of the Executivethat shipments should be so adjusted between food and munitions as to keepimportations as even as possible in Italy throughout the year, shortages in munitionsready for shipment at any time being compensated for by increased shipments offood, &amp;c, so far as may be desirable for the above reasons.I have also to inform you that M. Loucheur announced that a Freight Committeeof the Munitions Council would be established in London under the chairmanshipof Mr. W. T. Layton, Captain Pilliard representing France and Lieutenant FarinaItaly&apos; for the purpose of arranging details as to loading, &amp;c, with the TonnageCommittee of this Council.   This Committee has already held preliminary meetings.I should be glad to receive, as soon as possible, the detailed export programme(showing sources, and quantities of the several commodities, and specially notingany that are specially urgent and important) which corresponds to the request for10 million tons for the 6 months. The question of shipping allocation will thenbe carefully considered. I am, however, to observe that the very different distri-bution of imports as between the three countries, which appears to be contemplatedin the provisional statement received, will necessarily raise questions of greatdifficulty (including the question of the capacity of the ports to receive the desiredquantities), and it must not be assumed that shipping arrangements can be madein close conformity with the programme.J. A. Salter.
