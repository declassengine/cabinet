[This Document is the Property ,of His Britannic Majeaty&apos;b Government./2Printed for the War Cabinet. November 1018.--:---29CONFIDENTIALMEMORANDUM ON THE PROPOSED EXTENSION OF THE FUNCTIONSOF THE COMMITTEE OF THE PRIVY COUNCIL FOR SCIENTIFIC ANDINDUSTRIAL RESEARCH.I wish to submit, for the approval of the Committee on Home Affairs, a memo-randum, prepared in the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, andcontaining certain proposals, which have my concurrence, for the extension of thefunctions of the Committee of the Privy Council for Scientific and IndustrialResearch. To this memorandum I add a Minute by Lord Curzon, the Lord Presidentof the Council, urging the necessity, sooner or later, of transferring the powers nowexercised by the Committee of the Privy Council to an independent Ministry ofResearch.H. A. L. FISHER.October 30, 1918.The Department of Scientific and Industrial Research as the Nucleus of a Devart-ment of Research and Intelligence.1. The Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, as at presentorganised under the Committee of Council, is the nucleus of what may become incourse of time the national organ of intelligence and research available for theservices of all the administrative Departments of State. There are many tendenciesconverging in this direction in the growing needs of the United Kingdom, but thisdevelopment is essential if certain proposals for Imperial organisation now beforethe Government are to be effectively realised.The principle on which this Department has been founded is the necessity for aresearch organ of Government which will be unembarrassed by executive functionsand by the responsibility of exploiting the scientific results which it may obtain.Experience has from the beginning shown this principle to be sound, and it has beenuniformly recognised by all the Departments of State with which the Committee ofCouncil have had dealings.2. A Committee of the Privy Council was made the controlling body for scientificand industrial research because (a) it was able to deal with the whole UnitedKingdom, (b) it was the only means of bringing the new Department into relationwith the rest of the Empire in a simple and natural way, and (c). it was not anadministrative Department of State embarrassed with the day-to-day problems ofgovernment. Experience has proved the wisdom of this procedure. It has beenimitated in Canada and South Africa and to a large extent in Australia also. It hasenabled the new Department to work for, and win the confidence of, the executiveDepartments of State in a way which would have been impossible had it beenconcerned with administration. It has led to the proposal that on the establishmentof a Ministry of Health the Medical Research Committee should be transferred tothe Committee of Council, and the Machinery of Government Committee (LordHaldane&apos;s) has recommended that the Geological Survey should similarly be sotransferred from the Board of Education. The Coal Conservation Committee hasrecommended that the survey section of the Department, when established, shouldhave the power of putting down boreholes and so adding to our knowledge of themineral resources of the Kingdom, but it will have nothing to do with the admini-stration of mines or of labour questions. By arrangement with the Home Office itcould produce statistics and information as to iron and other ores which are thenecessary preliminaries to industrial research, and not leave them, as at present, tobe collected by different authorities as occasion arises.[940]
23. This method of organising research in its widest sense would not withdrawthe power of research from the executive Departments of the Government. EachDepartment must have the power and the means to. undertake investigations whichwill help them to deal with the day-to-day problems of administration, or which canonly be approached successfully by those who have first-hand knowledge of thedifficulties to be overcome. But there are many other problems which for one reasonor another could be better handled by a Department which was free from theembarrassment of executive government and which was so organised as to be inconstant touch with all other Departments and so able to act as a clearing house forthe benefit of each. A research into oxygen breathing apparatus is of interest tothe.Home Office, the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force. Such a research is nowbeing conducted for the benefit of all concerned by the present Department ofScientific and Industrial Research. Other researches take so long to conduct thatan executive Department is little likely to find time for them. Still others may raisecontroversial issues, and may therefore suitably be transferred to a Departmentwhich has no executive responsibilities. The putting down of compulsory boreholesor the conduct of experiments involving vivisection would be examples of this class.The success of the present Department with its limited scope and the difficulties thatarise from an artificial restriction of Government action to industrial research pointto an extension of the field of its activities in the manner suggested.4. If the Geological Survey and the Medical Research Committee were trans-ferred, the Department would already be on the way to becoming a Department forGeneral Research. Side by side with the present Advisory Council would sit theMedical Research Council (constituted on similar lines), and to that should beadded a third Council for Survey. At first this third Council might be confined totiie Geological Surveys of the United Kingdom, but there are other resources andphenomena which need surveying no less, and some of which are already aided bythe Treasury. The Meteorological Office is one of these. It has been well said thatthe war has led to the discovery of Meteorology as a science, and it is certain thatits study will in future be as vital to our existence as the chartering of the seas.Similarly, Oceanography and Geodesy, both, sciences of survey of the highest im-portance to this nation and Empire, should fall to the proposed third AdvisoryCouncil.5. As industrial research has been provided for independently of the Board ofTrade, so it might be held that research in agriculture could with equal effect beseparated from the administrative responsibilities of the Board of Agriculture, andthe research work of the Development Commission may sooner or later take its placebeside that of the three Councils already referred to.6. But the development here outlined is not only desirable in the nationalinterests. It is essential for the proper organisation of Imperial activities in science,economics, and intelligence. The new Imperial Mineral Resources Bureau cannot besuccessfully established unless (i) the machinery for survey in the several parts ofthe Empire, and, above all, in the United Kingdom is efficiently organised, and (ii)the relation of the local and national surveys to the Imperial Bureau is carefullythought out and defined. The same remarks apply mutatis mutandis to the ImperialBureau of Statistics proposed by the Imperial Conference this year. The first ofthese conditions must be satisfied, at least, so far as the United Kingdom is con-cerned, before it is possible to satisfy the second, because the United Kingdom isthe predominant factor and must be the seat of the Imperial Bureau. If the localsurvey in the United Kingdom and its relation to the Imperial Bureau are notproperly determined, if the United Kingdom statistics are not properly collected andpresented, there can be no hope that the other local surveys and statistical abstractswill come into proper relation with them.7. It is accordingly proposed that in the first instance: (i.) The Geological Survey, the Meteorological Office, and possibly the othersurveys referred to, be transferred to the Committee of the Privy Councilat present responsible for Scientific and Industrial Research, and anAdvisory Council for Surveys be appointed to advise the Committee.(ii.) &apos;J he Medical Research Committee and its work be transferred to the Com-mittee of the Privy Council on the establishment of a Ministry ofHealth, the Medical Research Committee becoming an Advisory Councilfor Medical Research.
(iii.) The powers of the Committee of the Privy Council be so enlarged as toenable it to undertake these and any other duties affecting research andintelligence that may from time to time be entrusted to it by the Govern-ment.(iv.) A supplemental Charter be granted to the Imperial Trust for the en-couragement of Scientific and Industrial Research enabling it to holdfunds for and on behalf of the Geological Survey, Medical Research,and any other activities which may in future be entrusted to the Com-raittee of the Privy Council.Minute by Lord Curzon.There is no reason why the draft Memorandum should not&apos; go to the HomeAffairs Committee of the War Cabinet if that is the body best qualified to deal withthe matter.The existing Department of Industrial and Scientific Research no doubt meetsa need, and as a stop gap arrangement, is of great practical value. But that it canlong continue in its present form seems to me quite impossible.Research is becoming a great and potent feature in the organisation of theState. Already it absorbs large sums of money. It will want infinitely more. More-over it will have to attract to its service the best scientific brains of the country. Weare in process of building up what will in time become one of the first Departmentsof Government.It is inconceivable that for sake of the prestige of the Privy Council, or thefacile looseness of its organisation and procedure, or the comforting precedents thatcan be drawn from the past such a task can for any length of time be undertakenby a Minister without an office, or a staff, located in a building where the Secretaryof his Department is not present, and dependent for advice upon an AdvisoryCommittee which is not at hand-a Minister, moreover, who may know nothing ofthe subject, and take no interest in his Department, and who is usually selected forthe office in question for entirely independent reasons, which it might puzzle even aDepartment of Scientific Research to discover or explain.The. time may not have come yet for the elimination of this dignified phantom.But sooner or later a Ministry of Research must surely come.October 27, 1918.
