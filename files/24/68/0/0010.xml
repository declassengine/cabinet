Confidential,1,11 0LABOUR POSITION IN MUNITION INDUSTRIES.(23rd October 1918.)I circulate the following notes which have been prepared in the Intelligence andStatistics Section of the Ministry of Munitions on the labour position in munitionindustries.WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.I-STRIKES.Statistics for Week ending the 16th October 1918.During the week ending the 16th October, 28,530 days just over one-seventhof 1 per cent, of the possible working days-were lost through strikes by munitionworkers.&apos;&quot;&apos;&quot; Two stoppages in Cumberland accounted for more than half of the totalloss of time. Two days each were lost by 3,000 blastfurnacemen, and three days eachby 3,000 iron ore miners : the latter are still on strike.II. -MOVEMENT OP WOMEN&apos;S LABOUR.An estimate has been prepared which throws light upon the movement ofwomen&apos;s labour in the munition industries, and the actual loss or wastage involved.The number of women employed by munition firms included in the MunitionsArea Release Scheme may be taken as approximately 1,000,000. The number ofthose who, for whatever cause, leave their employment in any month, is probably50,000, or 5 per cent, of the total. In a year, therefore, about 600,000 leave theiremployment. These, however, will include many cases in which an individual iscounted more than once, since a worker may pass through several firms in thesame year.Of this total of 600,000, approximately 90,000 cases are accounted for by sicknessor death and 144,000 by marriage, change of residence, unsuitability for the work,or other satisfying reasons. In the remaining 366,000 cases, the reason may beregarded as unsatisfactory, and ranges from a desire for change to discharge formisconduct.In estimating the actual loss of labour to the munition industry, allowance mustbe made for such factors as return after illness, transference to more suitable employ-ment within the munition industries, and other changes of employment involvingmerely a passage from one munition firm to another. The number of women actuallypassing each year out of the ranks of munition workers lies probably between 200,000and 250,000.It is difficult to gauge the accuracy of the estimates submitted, but, assumingthat they are approximately correct, it appears that among a million woman munitionworkers, the changes of employment for unsatisfactory reasons average in a year overa third of that number, while those leaving munition work altogether constitute fromone-fifth to one-fourth of the whole body.It remains to add that in numerous cases women leave almost as soon as theyhave been taken on, and that a high proportion of those leaving have not been at workfor more than one or two months. Dislocation and difficulty are occasioned inevitablyby taking on and starting a worker, who, for whatever reason, proves unsuitable forthe employment.* For the purpose of these statistics, munition workers are taken to include all classes of workers inrespect of whom the Ministry of Munitions would intervene in the event of a strike (a) in the munitionindustries proper (metals, chemicals, and rubber) ; and (ft) in certain auxiliary industries, e.g., iron ore mining,brickmaking, timber sawing, &quot;certified&quot; gas and electricity undertakings, &amp;c.A  (33)6640-4   Pk 50   125   10/18   E k S
