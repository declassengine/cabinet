(ft) on page 3 must also be included. In addition, a number of vessels shown under ore,phosphates, lead, &amp;u., load outward for an Allied Government. A comparison of the numbers shown under IV. for the8 months does net therefore give an accurate criterion of the vessels in Allied service at the different periods.^&quot;Requisition&quot; is here used to mean &quot;requisition for full Government service.&quot; The vessels shown asrequisition !&apos; therefore include the vessels that are requisitioned under the special liner requisitioning scheme : ;free fromt SPECIAL LINER REQUISITIONING SCHEME:-All liner trades are now requisitioned under special conditions, which, while leaving the vessels still under the manage-ment of their owners, and free so far as circumstances permit to accept private as well as Government cargo, secure that thevessels are operated on Government; account, the owners being paid on a Blue Book basis.II The decrease in the Liners shown under (4) on page 4 is due to the inclusion under IV. Qi) on page 2 of Liners whichare now definitely engaged in importing work for France and Italy. In addition, certain other vessels which, were previouslyshown under IV.
