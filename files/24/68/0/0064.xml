s^ocunienyis the Property-of His Britannic Majesty h Government]CONFIDENTIAL.&quot;October 30,1918.]Political Intelligence Department,Foreion Office.Turkey /008MEMORANDUMON .RELIEF WORK THAT MAY ARISE OUT OF AN ARMISTICE WITHTURKEY.1. IF we take control of Turkey militarily as a result of an armistice, that is,control of communications and of public security, we shall find ourselves morally boundto take measures for relief work, especially among the non-Turkish nationalities, whomit is our policy to liberate from Turkish misgovernment.Among these nationalities the Armenians will have a special claim. They havebeen the worst treated by the Turks during the war, and His Majesty&apos;s Governmenthave committed themselves in a special degree to putting an end to their sufferings.In 1916 the Foreign Office published a Blue Book (Miscellaneous, No. 31) containing theevidence of the Turkish atrocities, and members of the Government have repeatedlyreferred in their speeches to these atrocities as one of the chief crimes for which Turkeyis to be called to account.It may be added that to feed and clothe people when destitute is an infinitelymore effective form of propaganda than pamphlets or cinematograph films. Again,such relief work, if undertaken on a large scale, would involve the co-operation ofAmerica, and if it is desired that America should participate in the Middle Easternsettlement, this offers a good opportunity for her to do so.2. Areas.(A.) Lebanon.Autonomous before the war; was starved into surrender by the Turks in 1915,.and has suffered like the rest of Syria from the blockade ; since the British occupationof Syria it has been reported that the Lebanon is in great distress.On the other hand, the problem here is comparatively easy to deal with. Thepopulation was only about 500,000 before the war, and has probably decreased verymuch in the meanwhile. Access is easy from the ports of Akka, Beirut, and Tripoli;the food conditions in the surrounding parts of Syria and Palestine are comparativelysatisfactory. And though large consignments of foodstuffs may be necessary to relieveimmediate distress, it ought to be possible to deal with the Lebanon problem locallyafter a few months and feed the province by imports from the neighbouring districts,as it used to be fed before the war.(B.) Armenian Deportees in Northern Syria and Mesopotamia.Between the spring and autumn of 1915, over 1,000,000 Armenians men, women,and children were uprooted from their homes in Northern Turkey and deported&apos; southwards. Numbers ol them were massacred or died of exhaustion on the way, butfrom accounts of witnesses who saw the convoys pass at various points, it.w?s estimatedthat about 600,000 reached their places of exile alive. The same estimate was givenby Swiss and American relief workers who visited them in these plaoes in 1916 andlater. Even since they have been allowed to settle down, the mortality among themcaused by hunger, exposure, and disease has been terrible, but there is evidence thatsome of them have managed to take root, and though estimates of the numberssurviving at present are practically impossible to make, it would be safe to assume thatover 250,000 are still alive in conditions of extreme destitution, and will requireurgently to be dealt with.For instance, about 25,000 are known to have passed through Aleppo in 1915, andto have been planted at various points along the Hejaz Railway as far south as Maan.[367-49]
2Survivors of these have been rescued in the course of the British and Araboperations east oi&apos;Jordan, especially during the last advance, and on the 2nd SeptemberSir R. Wingate stated that the numbers in his refugee camp had risen to 0,000, while400 more were found at Amman.The deportees in this region had had the furthest to go, and had been subjected tothe worst conditions after their arrival. It may be expected, therefore, that thepercentage of survivors in the districts further north, where a great mass of the deporteeswas planted, will be found to be considerably greater.The main centres in which deportees were planted are as follows :  (a.) The zone of the Syrian and TIejaz Railways from Aleppo to Maan. Aleppo wasthe great clearing station from which deportees were distributed to places further afield.Large numbers, perhaps 50,000, remained in the city itself under appalling conditions.Others were distributed among towns and villages to the south and east. GeneralAllenby may come across large numbers of these at any moment in his advance.(b.) Der-el-Zor. Large numbers of deportees were sent on from Aleppo to theEuphrates, and strung out in camps along the river from Meskene to within about twodays&apos; inarch of Bagdad. The centre here was Der-el-Zor, and at least 30,00p areknown to have been concentrated in this town alone. A few of those further down theriver have already been rescued by General Marshall.(c.) Mosul Area. This area has hardly been visited since the deportees arrivedthere, and it is impossible to give any figure, but, the number must be large, since mosj;of the deportees from the north-eastern vilayets were driven in this direction, anc[others were senj; to join them from Aleppo along the Bagdad Railway. It is possible^haj; from one-tfiircj to a half Qf We survivors will be found in this area.(C.) Surviving Population in Turkish Armenia.This area, which includes the &quot; Six Vilayets&quot; as well as Trebizond and Cilicia, hassuffered first from the deportation of the Armenians, then from the flight of a large partof the Moslem population before the advance of the Russian armies, and then from ^heravages of the war itself. The fighting has passed to and fro over this region; placeslike Van and Bitlis have been taken and retaken, and finally the whole country hasbeen reoccupied by the Turks since last winter. The Turkish Government recentlyannounced its intention of taking certain measures of reconstruction and reform, but itmay be assumed that nothing has been done. Survivors of the original inhabitants ofthis region will have to be repatriated, but the longer this is postponed the better.Houses have been destroyed ; there are probably no foodstuffs in the country, and it isone of the most inaccessible parts of the former Turkish Empire. For jme present,deportees and refugees will be most easily dealt with in the centres where theyhow are.Meanwhile a remnant of the population remains which will have to be looked after.There are Armenians wliq have somehow lain hid, and Moslem refugees from theprovinces lost by the Turks in the Balkan war who were dumped here after theArmenians were turned out, and are reported to be in a terrible condition.(D.)- Caucasus.The Caucasus did not become a theatre of war till last spring, but at least 300,000Armenians and Nestorians from Turkish Armenia and North-West Persia were plantedhere during 1915. Many of these returned in 1910 after the Russian capture of Erzerumand Erzinjan, but they Avere uprooted once more in the fluctuating fighting, and againin the Turkish advance which began in February this year.This advance did not stop at the pre-war frontier. The Turks occupied thedistricts of Kars, Ardahan, and Batum, ceded by Russia in the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk,and the Armenian population fled further into the interior. Then the Turkish invasionspread north and east over Trans-Caucasia. There was bitter righting, especially in theEfivan district, and more country was devastated, more people uprooted.Meanwhile political anarchy and the breakdown of the railways cut off the importof foodstuffs from North Caucasia, on which Trans-Caucasia, with its population swelledby troops and refugees, had largely depended during the war. Masses of Armenians,though no estimate can be given of their numbers, have crossed the. Caucasus range bythe Tiflis military road, and are now congested at Vladikavkaz, These could probablybe fed from North Caucasia, if once political tranquillity were restored there.
(E.) Persia,Since the Turkish advance in Turkish Armenia and Morth-West Persia thissummer, such part of the local Armenian and Nestorian population as could not escapetowards the Caucasus fled south-eastwards towards the British lines in the direction ofHamadan.On the 2oth September last, Sir Percy Cox estimated the number that had arrivedat this place at about 60,000.They began to arrive in August, and His Majesty&apos;s vice-consul at Hamadanproposed that relief should he organised jointly by the British and American Govern-ments. His Majesty&apos;s Government put up the sum of 20,0001, which had beenallocated for the relief of famine among the local population, for this more urgent work.They also telegraphed in the sense of the vice-consul&apos;s proposals to the Ambassadorat Washington, and sent a message describing the situation to Mr. Judson, therepresentative of the American Committee for Armenian and Syrian Relief, who wasthen on his way to Persia.On the 5th September the political officer at Bagdad reported the arrival thereof amember of the Judson Mission, and stated his belief that the mission had ample fundsand allowances. On the 7th September, however, Sir C. Marling reported that thework of the Judson Mission would probably not make itself felt for some time, and therequirements of the refugees for September were estimated at 100,000 tomans.Up to the 11th September His Majesty&apos;s Legation at Tehran had drawn 20,000Lof Government funds for this relief work.3. Existing Belief Organisations.   y(A.) Armenian Refugees (Lord Mayors) Fund. Chairman, Aneurin Williams, Esq.,M.P.   Eon. Sec, Rev. H. Buxton.Nearly all the private donations given in Great Britain and the British EmpireforArmenian relief are administered through this, fund, and it allocates 10 per cent, of itsrevenues to the relief of non-Armenian populations in the Middle East.Recently the Archbishop of Canterbury, who had a mission among the Nestoriansof North-West Persia before the war but no relief fund for them, approached the LordMayor&apos;s Committee with the suggestion that they should undertake the administrationof all private relief from Great Britain for the refugees in Persia, who are mostlyNestorians, not Armenians, in return for which he would give the Committee all possiblepersonal support.The Lord Mayor&apos;s Committee is a non-sectarian organisation, and. is naturallybetter suited for centralising private charity than any new organisation under thepresidency of the Archbishop, and it is therefore to be hoped that the Committee willadopt his suggestion. They should be encouraged and helped to centralise the wholework of Middle Eastern relief so far as it depends on private British donations.(B.) The American Committee for Armenian and Syrian Relief (with which,it is helievecl, the American Committee for Palestine Relief has beenamalgamated).This Committee is by far the wealthiest and most influential private relieforganisation for the Middle East. The list of its members (see addendum) showsthe kind of men who serve on it. It is supported by the heads of the chief religiouscommunities in the United States, by leading politicians and business men, by ex-Ambassadors to Turkey, and by the Evangelical and Presbyterian missionaries, whohave a considerable hold over American public opinion.The anxiety of the missionaries to carry on this relief work is the real reason of theiropposition to a declaration of war on Turkey by the United States. If Turkeysurrenders, their pro-Turkism, which proceeds solely for this motive, will no longeroperate. It was this Committee which sent out the Judson Mission to Persia, and it issubmitted that the utmost possible use ought to be made of them.As in the case of Belgian relief, the requirements will probably exceed any possibleprivate contributions even from America. But the American Committee may be reliedupon to put up very large funds if the scope of their work is increased by the capitulationof Turkey and the co-operation with them of the British and American Governments.We may also have to rely \evj largely upon them for business organisers andrelief officers the leading men of the Committee supplying the former, the missionaries
&apos;4the latter. British Ministers, consuls, political officers, and military authorities in&apos; theMiddle East will be so burdened with other tasks that it will be desirable that theyshould delegate the work of administering relief as much as possible, while giving thiswork every facility, and keeping it under their ultimate control.ADDENDUM.Personnel of American Committee for Armenian and Syrian Relief,Executive Committee Samuel T.
