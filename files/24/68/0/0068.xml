A prisoner reported that enemysteamers and barges are now being withdrawn to winter quarters at Seltzo.A train containing a British half-battalion has been derailed about 40 miles north ofKandalaksha. It was thought, at firtet, to have been an attempt at sabotage by Bolshevikagents, but it was later discovered to have been due to faulty rolling stock. GeneralMaynard is organizing a Karelian force to guard the railway, which has lately beenthreatened in several places by enemy agents.The ships of the Russian Black Sea Fleet, which are now reported to be manned byGerman personnel, are one Dreadnought and two pre-Dreadnought Battleships, twoCruisers, five oil burning and six other Destroyers and six Submarines.The Germans are withdrawing from the Caucasus.In consequence of the defection of their Trans-Caspian Allies, British troops on 21stOctober suffered a reverse at Dirshalda on the Central Asian Railway west of Merv. TheBolsheviks, however, suffered heavily and later withdrew east to Tejend, leaving muchmaterial and ammunition in our hands. Our cavalry has followed up the enemy to apoint 13 miles east of Dirshalda, and the Trans-Caspian troops are beginning to re-form,Three armed merchant ships in the Caspian are now ready and at sea, and two othersare expected to be ready within the next week. The Turks are reported to be armingtwo of the eight steamers now at Baku.A few German Naval Officers are stated to be at Baku, but there is no confirmation ofthe report that a submarine in parts had arrived there.Discipline in the two Russian Gunboats forming the Caspian Fleet is said to have much Iimproved. These ships are now under the orders of Bicharakov, who is reported to bepfriendly but suspicious of our action in the Caspian.  He is short of ammunition.Naval Staff,Zlst October, 1918,[Appendix,
