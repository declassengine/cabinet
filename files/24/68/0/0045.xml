^ CKi&amp; Documentis the Property of His Britannic Majesty b Government.]V  .&quot;V  . 193SECRET.G.T.-6145.Political Intelligence Department,Foreign Office.Special 2.MEMORANDUMONTHE REPUBLICS OF &quot; NORTH CAUCASUS&quot; AND &quot; AZERBAIJAN,&quot; ANDENVER PASIIA&apos;S POLICY THERE.[With Map.]1. THE &quot;North Caucasus Republic&quot; was set up last summer by the mountaintribes of Daghestan, who since the Russian revolution had gradually freed themselvesfrom Russian military control.The tribes are so wild and split up (linguistically and geographically) that it isimprobable that they have established any effective central administration. *The only organ of Government of which we have any information is the delegationwhich went to Constantinople last summer and is probably still there.This delegation claimed for the &quot; North Caucasus Republic&quot; a wide territory,including the country of the Terek and Kuban Cossacks, where the population is purelyRussian and Ukrainian. But its authority is only acknowledged, if at all, by the SunniMoslem tribes of Daghestan, in North-East Caucasia. The remnants of the formerMoslem population of North-West Caucasia (Kabardians, Abkhasians, &amp;c.) seem to beholding aloof from it so far.The &quot; republic &quot; and its &quot; delegation &quot; are chiefly important as a liaison between theTurks and the various de facto independent Daghestani tribes.2. The &quot; Azerbaijan Republic &quot; was set up last May when the common Government ofTrans-Caucasia fell to pieces.The population (called by the Russians &quot; Caucasian Tatars &quot;) is Turkish-speaking.Their dialect is identical with that spoken in the adjoining Persian province ofAzerbaijan, and is closely related to Osmanli. The two Azerbaijans were only separatedby Russia&apos;s conquests at Persia&apos;s expense during the first thirty years of thenineteenth century. But for the war and the fall of the Tsardom they wouldultimately, no doubt, have been reunited under Russia. The actual frontier betweenthem is artificial.The present Government of the Azerbaijan Republic has developed out of theTatar National Council, founded early in the Revolution, and is in the hands of theTatar landowners.As landowners these hate the Bolsheviks; as Tatars they hate the Armenians,with whom their national claims conflict in the Karabagh and Erivan districts, where thereis a mixed population. As &quot; Turanians &quot; and Moslems they incline towards the Turks,with whom they have many common and no conflicting interests.They did not get on well with the Daghestanis at the beginning of the Revolution(the Daghestanis, who are not Turkish-speaking, were afraid of being domineered overby them). But the influence of the Turks, and the common danger recently incurredfrom the British and Armenians at Baku, may since have drawn them together.Nor do they get on with the Persians. For though they have kept in touch withPersian culture since the time when they belonged to Persia, they have also picked upWestern methods and ideas under the Russian regime (especially at Baku). Theyshow no signs of wishing to reunite with Persia, hut are working on the contrary toseparate Persian Azerbaijan from her and join it to themselves to form an independentState in close alliance with Turkey.3. Relations with Turkey. The Caucasian Moslems generally gave Russia troublein the Russo-Turkish wars of the last century (especially in 1877-8), and during this,war the Turks, as soon as the Revolution gave them an opening, sent agents toDaghestan and Azerbaijan to stir up revolt.[920-2]
2Their advance into the Caucasus this summer has given them direct contact, andif they were to retain the territories they annexed in June 1918 this contact would bepermanent.At this moment most of Azerbaijan, both Eussian and Persian, is occupied by theTurkish army. The Turks have been introducing technical advisers (even a Turkish&quot;financial expert&quot;) and military instructors, in imitation of German methods in theBaltic Provinces and the Ukraine. Baku was captured by a mixed force of Turks andTurkish-led Azerbaij arris.The Eussian Azerbaijanis claim Baku as their capital (though it is a cosmopolitancity!, and this has been a source of misunderstanding between the Turks and theGermans, since the latter, in their supplementary treaty with the Bolsheviks, guaranteedthe possession of Baku to Eussia over the Turks&apos; heads. The Turks naturally supportthr Azerbaijani claim, which would give Turkey indirect control over one of the richestcities in the world.4. Enver Pashas designs.- When Bulgaria capitulated, it seemed as though theC.U.P. had two alternatives either to take ship to Constanza and rejoin the moneythey liad deposited in Switzerland, or else to fight to the death at Constantinople.But there are now indications that Enver contemplates a third course to retreat tothe Eastern Caucasus and wage a guerilla warfare there, in repetition of his exploits inthe interior of Tripoli after the Treaty of Lausanne (1912).The Azerbaijan Eepublic has asked the British authorities in Persia for recog-nition, and Fuad Selim, the Turkish Minister at Berne, conveyed the same requestrecently to a British ;agent in Switzerland on behalf of the Azerbaijani delegates atConstantinople.Again, the Turks are reported to have promised to make the Crown Prince ofPersia (who is ex ofjicio governor-general of Persian Azerbaijan) ruler of a unitedAzerbaijan-doubtless to he independent under Turkish protection. They have alsoSpread a report dn Tehran that His Majesty&apos;s Government have offered PersianAzerbaijan to Turkey. It is rumoured further that they intend to unite Azerbaijanand Daghestan into a single State.Thus, the first aim of the Turks seems to be to bluff His Majesty&apos;s Governmentinto recognising the independence of Eussian Azerbaijan, then to strengthen this Stateby adding Daghestan and Persian Azerbaijan to it (presumably through fakedplebiscites), and to keep the whole.area under Turkish control.But should we not fall into the trap (and they can hardly be in earnest in expectingus to do so), they probably anticipate that they can hold this area by force. Its naturaldefences are extraordinarily strong on the north, the Caucasus range and theDaghestau bastion ; on the west, the mountains of Kara Bagh ; and on the south, thehills of Persian Azerbaijan and Gilan, inhabited by wild Turkish-speaking tribes likethe Shahsevens and-anti-British guerillas like the Jangalis.The region might even be made self-sufficing, since the oil and industry of Baku,the agriculture of the Aras and Kura plains, ,and the fighting material of the mountaintribes would be at the disposal of those who controlled it.It is peculiarly inaccessible to British forces based on Syria and Mesopotamia, sincethe wide zone of Turkish Armenia and Kurdistan lies between, across which it wouldtake months or even years to construct effective communications.On the other hand, it lies entirely &quot;open towards Constantinople, since there arerailways leading from the Black Sea ports of Batum and Poti to Baku and Tabriz,and these railways are already under Turco-German control, while the Black Sea willremain so till the Straits are opened to the Allies.As for the railways leading to European Eussia, only that running from Bakualong the Caspian ccast is yet completed, and it is commanded by the Daghestanitribes.5. These considerations suggest that it may be the policy of the C.TJ.P. (or, at anyrate, of Enver) to hold on at Constantinople up to the last possible moment, pullingthe wires of a puppet &quot; Ententophil&quot; Government, and then take ship to Batum whenthe-game is up and the Straits are on the point of falling.The campaign, of 1912 in the Tripoli hinterland was a great success as propaganda,an 1 it is evident that this is to be set going again by a new mission from Constanti-- nople, which will proceed by submarine with the Senussi. This will keep the Pan-islamic movement alive in -Moslem Africa, where European prestige has been shaken(chiefly through Italian incompetence) during the war, and where the Turkish debaclein the Arab provinces of Asia will hardly be realised.The plan of campaign in Azerbaijan is no doubt designed to create a similar focus

of unrest in the north-eastern parts ,of the Islamic world, and the outlook here ispossibly more promising. The breakdown of Russia must have had a more profoundpolitical effect in Central Asia than the Italian reverses have had in Africa. Thescenes of Turkish defeats in Mesopotamia and Syria are equally remote, and any effectof these defeats on Turkish prestige is more than counterbalanced by the actual adventof the Turks in Azerbaijan as victors. Again, the Azerbaijanis are bound to theTurks, not only by the Islamic tie, like the Tripoli Arabs, but by their communityof language and nationality, which has recently been given prominence in the &quot; Turanian &quot;movement. Above all, the Turkish designs in this area are favoured by the anarchywhich the Russian breakdown has caused. The conquest of Daghestan cost Russianearly a century of laborious warfare. This work has been undone in a year, and thetribes are now independent again. With Turks to equip and lead them, they mightbe able to hold their own against all comers.The C.U.P., in fact, have not given up the game. The war may lead to theopening of the Straits and the partition of the Ottoman Empire. But it has immenselyweakened the orderly forces of civilisation, and loosened the hold of Europe over largeareas of the Moslem world.   There may still be room in this world for Enver.
