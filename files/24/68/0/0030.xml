Ministry of National Service,

25th October, 1918.

Sir, 

I am directed by the Minister of National Service to refer to the decision of the War Cabinet given on the 15th instant (War Cabinet 486 Minute 12) for release of 34,000 4 and B1 miners from the Forces, and directing that the Admiralty, the War Office and the Air Ministry should arrange for the transfer to the Reserve of their respective quotas.

It will be remembered that at the Conference presided over by the Minister of National Service on the 2nd September, at which the Admiralty, the War Office, and the Air Ministry were represented, it was agreed that in order to determine the respective quotas of the three Services 

"if the War Cabinet decided upon the release of more miners, the total number to be released should be settled in terms of Grade 1 men, such total not be divided as equitably as possible based on the number of miners posted to the Navy, Army and Air Force respectively during the last twelve months. The Ministry of National Service would ascertain this proportion."

The Ministry of National Service has made full enquiries and the most accurate returns which can be obtained show that the miners recruited during the 12 months 1st September, 1917, to 31st August 1918, were distributed among the Services as follows:-

Numbers. Percentage of Total.

(a) The Navy 4,258 5%

(b) The Army 77,269 93% 

(c) The Air Force 1,565 2%

83,092 100%

On the basis of a release of 34,000 miners the numbers to be found by the Services as from 15th October 1918 will therefore be:-

From the Navy 1,700

From the Army 31,620

From the R.A.F. 680

34,000

Similar letters have been sent to the Admiralty, the War Office the Air Ministry and the Local Controller.

I am, sir,

Your obedient servant.

(Sgd.) P.LLOYD GR?

The Secretary,

The admiralty, the War Office,

and the Air Ministry.
