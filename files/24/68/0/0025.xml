It has given general satis-faction to the various grades of personnel of the MercantileMarine who are represented on the National Maritime Board,v/hich is constituted within the Ministry to deal with mattersaffecting the personnel of the Mercantile Marine.TRAINING OF BOYS FOR THE MERCANTILE MARINE.The first batch of youths trained for the MercantileMarine at the Sea School recently established at Gravosend havecompleted their training.The training is of an intensive character designed togive the youths a clear idea of how to perform the practicalwork that is required on an ordinary Merchant ship.    Therepresentatives of both employers and employed on the NationalMaritime Board are co-operating to place these youths in suit-able engagements afloat.NORTH RUSSIAN EXPEDITION.MILITARY SUPPLIES.Since the last report the Vfar Office have receivedfurther urgent demands for supplies required before the winter,and to meet these it was necessary to allocato one further ship-,for Archangel.howeverThis vessel ha3, sailed for Murmansk in the firstinstance, and instructions have, been given to the PrincipalNaval Transport Officer, North Russia that she is only toproceed to Archangel is he considers weather conditionssufficiently favourable to enable him to deal with her safely.Further Military supplies for Archangel can only besent by the Icebreaker service (see below).Civilian Supplies for Archangel.The failure of the United States authorities toprovide the tea required for shipment from United States ofAmerica necessitated the allocation of a small vessel to carrythis with a certain  quantity of reserve rations of army biscuit.One of the United States vessels carrying foodstuffsdirect from United States of America broke down in mid-Atlanticand had to be diverted to the United Kingdom to discharge.Arrangements/
Arrangements were consequently made with the Food Ministry toallocate an equivalent amount from British stocks and this hasbeen despatched direct from this country with a similar provisoas in the case of the last Military store ship regarding thevessel&apos;s entry into Archangel being dependent on weather conditionCivilian Supplies for Murmansk,The United States having definitely refused to providetonnage for this service, arrangements are now being made forthree month&apos;s supply amounting to 3,000 tons to be sent by aBritish vessel.Military Stores for Murmansk.Shipments to Murmansk have been very light whileattention was being concentrated on Archangel, but have now beenresumed.    Two ships have 3ailed, a third is loading and a fourthallocated.    Subsequent shipments will not be at so rapid a rate,the above representing an accumulation of demands.Homeward cargo.Attention had hitherto been  directed primarily to thejKhipment of flax which has first priority.    So far 13222 weighttons have been brought to this country, 2842 are on passage, andit is anticipated that a total of about 35,000 tons in all willbe lifted by the close of the season for United Kingsora, Franceand America.    Three vessels carrying 3398 tons flax and mis-cellaneous cargo have been allocated for Prance.    Four Britishships proceeding to Canada have carried 3587 tons to Canada forUnited States of America, and three United States ships have beenallocated to load 4440 tons.In view of the fists priority, and the necessity ofshipping timber to Murmansk for military purposes, timber ship-ments to this country have hitherto been small.    At present 1834standards are en route, also two cargoes of aspen.    Two cargoesof aspen and two of plywood have been brought by small Russiansealing steamers.Two ships are now loading timber but further allocationsmust depend on weather conditions.Icebreaker Service.Shipment of cargo to Archangel during winter willdepend on the cargo carrying Icebreakers.     Five Russian fisal-ing steamers varying from 700 - 1700 tons capacity will beavailable, but one of these is under repair and cannot be readyuntil the end of the year.     In addition the Hudson1s Bay steamer&quot;NASGOPIE&quot; carrying about 1500 tons is being brought from Canada or this service.Shipments will be made from this country direct or bytranshipment to the Icebreakers fat Murmansk as circumstancesrequire.Steps are being taken to bring the Russian sealingsteamers and also such of the large Icebreakers proper as willretain their Russian crews under effective Allied control inorder to ensure the proper working of the service.    The largeIcebreakers which are not themselves cargo carriers will be usodto clear a passage through the neck of the finite Sea and up theDwina river for the sealing steamers, which are themselvesspecially adapted for working in ice.Much/
Much must, however, depend on the severity or other-wise of the conditions experienced this winter.FLEET REQUIREMENTS.A demand has been recpived for the temporary allo-cation of an additional Ammunition carrier   for urgent workin connection with operations on the Belgian Coast and hasbeen met.REMOVAL OF BRITISH MILITARY INVALIDS IN TURKISH HANDS,Information has been received that a large numberof British military invalids are now in the neighbourhood ofSmyrna awaiting evacuation, and a hospital ship has beenordered to proceed accordingly to evacuate these invalids toEgypt.USE OF FRENCH PORTS FOR BRITISH MILITARY STORES.The possibility of using Dunkirk to an increasedextent for British military stores is being investigated nowthat the Belgian Coast has been cleared, owing to a requestfrom the French that a part of the port of Havre shall befreed for the use of the Americans *CHERBOURO/TAMNTO ROUTE.The use of this route to a modified extent forstores has been recommenced.STORES FCR THE BRITISH ARMY IN FRANCE.     .The quantity of military stores discharged in Francein the week ending 19th October was 184,501 tons, as comparedwith 179,353 tons during the previous week.I am,Your obedient Servant,(Signed) John Anderson,,
