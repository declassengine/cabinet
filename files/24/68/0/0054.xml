9 fi)r)f.J IW  *Copy ICQ.       /2-*Appreciation of the Situation, 30th October, 1913.1. :   2he military situation in Central Europe is at presentdeveloping at rapidly, that a frequent stock-taking is necessaryin order to follow the course of evento.    For three days theWestern battle front has been practically quiescent, but thelogical sequence of the sutcession of Allied victories during thepast three months is reaching fruition.2.    The menace to Germanyfs cohesion is now threefold, andconsists in:-(a) The pressure of the Allied Armies   en the Western Front;(b) The collapse of the Eastern and South-Eastern frontsowing to the defection or defeat of Germany&apos;s allies;(c) The internal disintegration of the German Empire.The third factor is not merely a corollary to the othertwt, but is of collateral growth.3.    Early in September, the various stages in the Germanretirement had been forecast with approximate accuracy, viz;-   awithdrawal to the line of the Scheldt and Serre by the beginning efNovember, and a subsequent retreat to the line of the House.   Thisplan was the obvious solution of an elementary problem in militarymathematics based on man power, and the necessity for its adoptionmust have been as patent to the German General Staff as it was toour own.   In view of the advanced season, and the comparativeexhaustion of the Allied Armies after more than seven months ofincessant fighting, it must remain doubtful whether this yearfsoperations on the Western Front can do more than accelerate andinconvenience the German plans.   To rupture the enemy&apos;s defensivefront and roll up great portions of his armies, cutting off theirretreat, is a goal tha4: may be hoped for thin year, but notanticipated irith certainty.   Any relaxation of our effort, however,is liekly to imperil suocess, or will at any rate postponeconsiderably our ultimate victory.% y .4.    YiJhen we turn to the Eastern and South-eastern theatres,and review the events of the past six weeks, we find a record ofmilitary achievements which surpasses almost anything the war hasyet seen.   This wonderful sequence oi successes was, of course,only rendered possible by tJv Sfact that Germany&apos;s whole effort  -was pinned down to the Western Front throughout the summer, thusrobbing her of her two strongest weapons:-   the initiative andinterior lines.5.    This being recognized, the fact remains that theopportunity created was taken full advantage of by the militarygenius of the Allied Commanders in the Balkans and in Palestine.The offensives launched on the 15th September were pursued withsuch vigour and skill that, by noon on the 30th September, Bulgariahad capitulated unconditionally, while the main Turkish armies hadbeen routed and driven from Palestine, the broken remnants beingin full flight to Asia Jlinor.6.    During the month of October, the course if eventsproceeded logically.   In spite of the shortening of the line onthe Western Front - according to plan - the German armies werebeing so heavily punished that only one division (the Alpine Corps)could be released to reinforce the grumbling Balkan front, and to Ifight
6 hofight a difficult rearguard action   baok to the Danube; on theother hand, five divisions had to be transferred to the west fromthe already threadbare Russian front.7.    The military strength of Germany being the keystone ofthe Central Powers&apos; Alliance, the crumbling of that strengthinevitably entails both the dissolution of the Alliance and thebreaking up of the German Empire.   Austria-Hungary and Turkey,only too conscious of what Germany&apos;s previous power had been,clung desperately to the possibility of ijrs revival for almost amonth after Bulgarian defection.   How, however, they find thatthey have been &quot;prophets of Baal&quot;, and are taking steps to throwoff their allegiance.   Austria&apos;s mind on this subject had beenmade up even before Lord Cavan&apos;s euccessful offensive on theItalian Pront, and was greatly accelerated by the long-suppressedrevolt of the Slav nationalities.8.    The defection of Turkey means the destruction ofGermany&apos;s schemes of expansion eastwards, the Iosb of thevaluable mineral ores and oils of the Cauoasus, the cotton ofCentral Asia, the raw materials of Anatolia and Thrace.Austria&apos;s secession maans far more; the dream of&apos;Hittel-Europa&apos; is shattered for ever, but still more vital isthe loss of Hungary, \7allachia and the Ukraine, Germany1s main wargranaries, together with the oilfields of Galicia and Roumania.9.     This last factor alone is decisive for Germany&apos;s power ofprolonging the war.   Before the war, Germany&apos;s annual consumptionof mineral oils (including petrol) was 1,152,000 tons.   In Francethe present consumption of all oils shows an increase of 150$over the pre-war demand; we shall therefore be on the safe side inallotting Germany a 50$ increase, putting her present annualrequirement at 1,728,000 tons.Germany herself, however, produces less than 100,000tons of mineral oils annually, being dependent for the remaining1,528,000 tons on Galicia and Boumania.   This amount is slightlyin excess of their   peace output, but doubtless within roach oftheir war effort.The above figures show that Germany cannot continue thestruggle without Austria, if only for want of oil and petrol.10,   The events of the last week show that these lessonshave not been lost on the German people or on its rulers.Desperate efforts have been made by Germany&apos;s autocrats toweather the storm, but political amnesties and promises ofconstitutional reform have proved of little avail.   On tho 23rdOctober, on the occasion of Liebknechfs release from prison, avigorous demonstration was held by the Radical-Socialists outsidethe Bolshevik Embassy in Berlin.   On the 24th, Ledebour, theIndependent Social-Democrat uttered the following words in aspeech in the Reichstag:-   &quot;The baneful influence of the Kaiser mustbe removedD   The whole monarchical system must be abolishedaltogether&quot;.   On the same day the Prussian War Minister, Generalvon Scheuch, made an unsatisfactory statement regarding the outputof munitions, and explained Germany&apos;s failure as-!,regards tanks byadmitting that:-   &quot;To manufacture them in large numbers was notpossible, as the country&apos;s industries were entirely monopolized bythe Hindenburg programme&quot;.11,   On the following day (October 25th) a Crown Council washeld, at which the Emperor, Hindenburg and Ludendorff v/ere present.As a result of this Council, Genera.I. Ludendorff, whovhact directedfor over two years the strategy of the German armies as vroll as themilitary policy of the Empire, 7fas relieved of his post.;.Ludendorff
9^0Ludendorff possessed the, confidence of every officer and man in thoGerman army; all felt that his was the military genius whichinspired and directed the plans of the Supreme Command. Ludendorff&apos;sdeparture is for every German soldier a confession of Germany&apos;smilitary failure.12,   Military failure is the one thing which can convince amilitary nation like Germany.   On the 25th October,  &apos;Vorwarts&apos;wrote as follows:-   &quot;All&quot;Germany&apos;e Allies have capitulated, or haveas good as capitulated.   Germany has resisted to the last, but willfinally be obliged to tread the same path.   A flight of a fe&quot; weeksor months can alter nothing in this unavoidable issue&quot;.Ho wonder then that we actually read in the &quot;ITorddeutscheAllgemeine Zeitung&quot;, the semi-official, organ of the GermanGovernment:-&quot;The concern of all peoples should be to put an end to thismurderous war, and to settle the remaining matters in a spirit of      vjustice, in accordance with the demands cf President Wilson&quot;.Germany is at our mercy; this, however, is not the timefor a display of mercy, but for the execution of justice.   VFe canand must exact full reparation for Germany&apos;s past misdeeds, as wellas the maximum guarantees for our future security. c(Sd,) C,H. Harington.Hajor-General.for C.I.G.B.eneral Staff,War Office,30th October, 1918.
