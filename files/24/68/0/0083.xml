3iq(This document lo the Property of His Iritaiinic Majesty&apos;s Government)^ Si- War Cabinet.G.T. 6182,&quot;Phosphate Roclc Imports&quot;.Memorandum by the President of the Board of Agriculture, The Secretaryfor Scotland, and The Chief Secretary for Ireland.The war Cabinet, on October 1st, 1918, (War Cabinet 480,Minute 6), accepted a suggestion based on an Appendix submitted byMr. Churchill that Munitions and rood should be allotted equaltonnage for the first 6 months of the Cereal year.On the basis of this decision the Ministry of Munitionspropose to cut down the import of Phosphate Roclc from 300,000 tons to100,000 tons on the ground that the smaller figure appeared in theirAppendix, which document also contained the incorrect statement that&quot;Very little Phosphate Rock imported now will affect the harvest of&quot;1919&quot;.The President of the Board of Agriculture for England andWales, and the Secretaries for Scotland and Ireland, ask the WarCabinet to review the situation that would be produced in Agricultureby the decision of the Ministry of Munitions to cut out 66$ of theROfk supply which, for purposes of convenience, that Department hashitherto imported on behalf of the Board of Agriculture.1.    In the first place every ton of Rock imported up till larchnext will affect the harvest cf 1919, and every ton of Rock.importedwill,&apos;It is estimated, save the importation of three tons ofconcentrated food,2.    Without Phosphates, in addition to the reduction of cerealproduction, neither potatoes for human beings, nor roots for cattlecan be grown in the present quantities.   In view of the grave shortageof concentrated cattle food and the commandeering of the farmers1barley for bread and of their hay for the Amy, millt and meat suppliesmust mainly depend on roots,3.    The closing down of the Superphosphate factories wouldseriously dislocate part of the industrial world, and the essentialindustry of fertiliser making would be crippled at a time when it isimperative that food production be increased.4.    Unless, therefore, the allocation of Phosphate RockOctober 1918 - March 1919 can be restored to 300,000 tons, the farmingindustry will be seriously affected, and the output of food in theUnited MiivdoLi during 1919 greatly diminished.It may be pointed out that the import of Phosphate Rock fromNorthern Africa in no way clashes with Atlantic freights or thebringing over of United States Troops, munitions, or food.   Thefreight for Algerian Rock is entirely supplied by empty steamersreturning from the Mediterranean ports after discharging coal, etc.in Italy, and like services.The bulk of these vessels would cone home empty but for ourrequirements of Phosphate Rock, and Iron and other Ores.   So far therehas never been a shortage of suah empty tonnage for sufficient IronOres as well as Rock, and it must be pointed out that the Ministry of1.
I ifICunitiono in their Appendix have retained their full figure for3,150,000 tons of Spanish Iron Ores unreduoed by 1 ton. while cuttingout 66)1 of the Hoard of Agriculture&apos;s 300,000 tons of Rock.If, as is unlikely, freight is not fully available for IronOre in the Mediterranean empty snips as well as for Rock, is it toomuch to ask that Iron Ores may be reduced by 6J*?   This triflingreduction could hardly be felt in view of the estimate that there isenough iron ore existing in the United Kingdom within 10 ft. of thesurface to supply the hlngdom with its entire steel requirements for200 years, which oan be dug at the rate of 1,000 tons a year by eachlabourer employed.The Board would gladly transfer 200 of its allocation ofGerman Prisoners to this work in exchange for the imported Rock.Prom past experience it is expected, however, that if the -Shipping Controller is again authorised to bring in 300,000 tons ofRock, he will be able to fit this small tonnage into his returningempty Italian Coal boats without any fresh reference to the MaritimeCouncil.The Beard of Agriculture, therefore, requests that theShipping   Controller be instructed to bring in Phosphate   Bock at thepreviously agreed rate of 300,000 tons October 1918 to Larch 1919.The position with regard to Ireland is amplified in theattached Appendix.R.E. PR0TK3R0,ROBERT I-TJMliO.KD7/ARD SHORTT.5th November, 1918.Appendix.Memorandum by Kr.iT. R. Campbell, Assistant Secretary to theIrish Department of   Agriculture, re Supply of Rock Phosphate.Chief Secretary,There is no agricultural requisite so important for ourtillage schemes as      phesphatic manure.   It is even more importantto Ireland than to England.Irish land will not grow root cropo without phosphates;and the land cannot be kept clean and productive without the rootcrop, which is the ameliorating and cleaning crop of the rotation.(f Great Britain has been getting more than 90 per cent, ofthe feeding stuffs which make ordinary farmyard manure valuable.Hence the Irish farmer has the more need of phosphates because ofthe poverty of the manure made cn his farm.lloreover, Ireland has exported during past generationssuch numbers of cattle, sheep and other stock, which remove2.
318phosphate in the form of hone, etc., that our land is speciallydeficient in this essential plant food.On 1st June last we arranged with the English Eood Productip:Department      the predominant partner in the allocation ofagricultural requisites * that m should get 28 per cent, of theproposed import of 300,000 tons of rook, that heing the greatestquantity we could then hope to get the Shipping Controller to bringto the United iCingdom.But, I felt at the time that the Pood Production Departmentdid not seem to fear a scaroity of phosphate so much as Ireland does;and I wrote a letter to ay colleague in that Department on 24th Junelast pointing out how concerned we were as to how our tillageprogramme could be maintained on our share of the 300,000 tons of rockphosphate, and pressing our view that the total import of phosphateshould be increased by another 150,000 tons of rock.Inasmuch as our share of 300,000 tons would make less super-phosphate than we used before the war, and as we have a much biggerarea to manure than formerly, the proposal now made to reduce theimport iron 300,000 to 100,000 tons, if carried into effect, willmake tillage impossible, and will compel us to advise farmers toresort to the old practice of fallowing the land to clean it.   Butthis means that such lands will produce no crop and no food, which inthese times is unthinkable.It is important to note that we have in Ireland sufficientworks to manufacture all the superphosphate we require if we get theraw naterial.The only other supply of phosphatic manure of anyconsequence is basic slag - an article made in Great Britain - ofwhich we are getting all we can hope to receive, and I do not thinkit is possible to increase the output, it being a by-product of theironworks.(Intld.)   J.R.C.2nd November, 1918.3.
