FOOD IS PRODUCTION SCHEMES, IRELAND.

Memorandum prepared in compliance with Chief Secretary&apos;s Minute of 17th March, 1917.

Week ended 23rd October, 1918.

The following is a brief statement on the work of the Department during the past week in furtherance of increased Food Production in Ireland:-

LOANS FOR AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENTS.

Twenty-seven applications for loans for agricultural implements were received by the Department during the past week. The total value of machinery ordered from the beginning of the present year, to date, under the Scheme, amounts to Â£92,818.

COMPULSORY TILLAGE REGULATIONS.

The Tillage Section was engaged during the past week principally in carrying out arrangements for the collection of rents in the case of lands set in conacre by the Department and for restoring possession of such lands to the occupiers.

PROGRESS OF THE HARVEST.

The improvement in the weather conditions generally during the past week enabled good progress to be made with harvest work. In at least one northern country, however, there was little improvement in the weather, and some corn still remains to be harvested. The unsatisfactory conditions in which the oat crop generally has been harvested indicates that care will need to be exercised in the selection of seed for next season&apos;s crops. A large demand for handpower and other small crushing machines is reported. Potato digging is now general, and on the whole crop is yielding satisfactorily, particularly Arran Chief and Date varieties. The Champion variety is producing a large percentage of small tubers. Reports show that the yields of flax, where scutching has been done, are variable and in general below average. The lifting and pitting of mangols is preceeding. Catch crops are reported to be doing well. Some farmers got their wheat sown during the week, and if the weather continues favourable further progress will be made this week.

Harvesting. There was a slight improvement in the weather during the past week, but the general harvest work was so seriously in arrears that farmers were unable to get secured much of their flax
