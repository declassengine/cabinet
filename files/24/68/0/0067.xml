Confidential *LABOUR POSITION IN MUNITION INDUSTRIES.(30th October 1918.)I circulate the following notes, which have been prepared in the Intelligence andStatistics Section of the Ministry of Munitions, on the labour position in munitionindustries.&apos;    WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.I. STRIKES.Statistics for Week ending the 23rd October 1918.The strike of iron-ore miners in Cumberland caused a loss of 19,800 days, morethan two-thirds of the total number of days lost during the week. A strike at theworks of Messrs. Rubery, Owen and Company (Darlaston) involving 1,100 workerslasted for three days. Several small strikes, in addition, brought the days lost bymunition workers&apos;&quot;-1 during the week up to a total of 29,350, less than one-fifth of 1 percent, of the possible working time.The Aircraft Difficulty.General calm, in the labour world has been disturbed by acute difficulties amongaircraft woodworkers at Liverpool. The local aircraft committee has been conductinga bitter campaign against a scheme of payment by results brought into operation atthe Aintree National Aircraft Factory. It was introduced about two months ago atthe instance of the woodworkers themselves, who voted for its provisions by 862 to 12.Some weeks ago the trade unionists at the factory were threatened with expulsionfrom their societies unless they either ceased to work under the new scheme or lefttheir employment. At two small uncontrolled establishments, holding sub-contractsfrom the factory, strikes broke out on the 8th October owing to the refusal of the mento handle material intended for the use of the workers-at the factory. Thesepremonitory symptoms have now been followed by a general strike of the wood-workers in the district.. The attitude of the local aircraft committee, backed by some of the constituentunions, lias been adopted against the consistent advice of the National Woodworkers&apos;Aircraft Committee, which is negotiating with the Ministry concerning the inter-pretation of the understanding arrived at in October last year with regard to paymentby results schemes. The contention of the National Committee is that no new systemshould be introduced into particular establishments without the consent of themajority of the woodworkers in the district, and it is upon this ground also that theLiverpool strikers take their stand. On the other hand, the Ministry, in order toaccelerate output in the national interest, have approved such schemes where themajority of workers in a particular establishment were favourable, as was over-whelmingly the case at the Aintree Factory.The cause of the upheaval at Liverpool is not to be sought for in war conditions,but in the settled policy of certain of the woodworking unions in normal times. Therules and customs of these unions are entirely opposed to payment by results, and theopponents of change fear that the introduction of new methods under war measureswill eventually prejudice their position in times of peace. The carpenters and joinersare the principal group of workers involved, and before the war their employmentwas in a large degree dependent upon fluctuations in the building trade. As aconsequence, the idea is widely current among them that increased output by theindividual must lead to fewer jobs for the mass.   An element in the situation not to* For the purpose of these statistics munition workers are taken to include all classes of workers in respectof whom the Ministry of Munitions would intervene in the event of a strike (a) in the munition industriesproper (metals, chemicals, and rubber) ; and .(6) in certain auxiliary industries, e.g., iron-ore mining, brickmaking, timber sawing, &quot; certified &quot; gas and electricity undertakings, &amp;c.a  (33)G(i-l0-5   Pk 50   125   11/18   K &amp; S
2be overlooked is that, so far, the introduction of payment by results schemes hasbeen confined to the entirely new industry of aircraft construction, and has notaffected the work of the building trades.II. WOMEN&apos;S WAGES IN IRELAND.A claim has been made by workers&apos; representatives for the application of thewomen&apos;s wages Orders in their entirety to women munition workers in. Ireland.The general level of wages among Avomen non-munition workers is very low. Therates due if the Orders were applied! -to the southern and western inland townswould, it appears, be at least twice as high as those of any other industry. In orderto secure an amicable settlement of these wages questions the Minister has appointeda small committee representative of trade union and employing interests, presidedover by an officer of the Ministry. This body will investigate and report as to theremuneration which should be paid to women and girls employed on munition workin various private establishments in Ireland, and also as to the wages position inthe Irish National Factories. Regard is to be had to the provisions of the women&apos;swages Orders, the standard contract prices of the articles manufactured, and thefactors affecting the cost of production.
