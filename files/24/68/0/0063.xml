DENMARK. The German Authorities will only allow safe conducts to Danish ships carrying cryolite to Allied Destinations on condition that the percentage of Danish exports of cryolite to the Central Empires in 1917 is maintained. In order to maintain the 1917 percentage it will be necessary for the Danes (a) to reduce their exports to the Allies or (b) to send to Germany 1,250 tons of crolite during the next six months. The new Danish Agreement provides that the Danish exports of cryolite to Germany shall be restricted to 1,000 tons during the first six months of the Agreement.

NORWAY. The Allied Blockade Committee have decided that Northern Russia shall be considered as an Allied destination within the mean of the Agreement between Norway and the United States.
