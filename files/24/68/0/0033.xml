Sir, 

G.T.5425. In continuation of Air Ministry letter No. B.96 (C.A.S.), of the 13th August, 1918, on the subject of the allocation of squadrons as between the Navy, Army and Independent Force, R.A.F., I am commanded by the Air Council to forward a revised and amended Programme of Development up to June 1st., 1919. (Table "A" attached).

The Prorgamme contained in the Air Ministry letter above quoted formed the subject of consideration by the Air Policy Committee of the War Cabinet on September 5th attended by the Secretary of State for War and the First Sea Lord of the Admiralty. As a result certain modifications were agreed to, and the Programme as modified and agreed to, was sanctioned by the Committee (Table "B" attached).

The past six weeks have, however, witnessed great changes in the general allied situation, and the Air Council are now of the opinion that every effort should be made to accelerate the formation of new squadrons up to June, 1919, even at the partial expense of subsequent development. Accordingly, the programme now submitted for sanction covers only such squadrons as it is hoped to place in the field during the next 7 months.

On comparison of Table B with Table A it will be remarked that certain further modifications have been introduced. In the former programme the total numbers of the squadrons allocated to the Army, Navy and Independent Force respectively up to September 30th, 1919, were as follows:-

Navy 102

Army 140

Home Defence 20

Independent Force 56

Unallotted Reserve 10 328

In the present programme, which it is to be noted, covers a period of 4 months less than that of August 13th, the revised figures are as follows:-

Navy 82

Army 125

Home Defence 20 

Independent Force 48 275

The unalloted emergency reserve of 10 squadrons is absorbed into the Navy, Army and Independent Force.

 
-2-fciuoh slight r a duct ions as nov. appear on tho rate ofexpansion have boon necessitated by the fact that engine /produxrtrio&amp;.a factor upon which, as tho v/ar Cabinet arc well at/aro, theaircraft programmo is chiefly dependent, has, owing to a varietyof causes, over which the Air Council have no control,fullon short of tho anticipation of the Ministry of Munitionsin august last.-The Air Council have only decided on tho allocation shownin Table &quot;A&quot; after the moat detailed review oi tho whole Warsituation and oi tho present military position in Prance andBelgium, where the possibility of   a break in the enomy&apos;s front,demands the strongest possible concentration   of aircraft.Accordingly the army allocation has not boon reduced in fullproportion from tho basis of the earlier programme.Tho Naval allocation is, it must be recognised, somewhatreduced, but the iiir Council hope thvt tho war considerationswhich have influenced them will bo appreciated by tho Admiralty.In conclusion, 1 am to request that this programme maybe brought early to tho attention of tho v/ar Cabinet for theirdecision,I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,(Sd. ) ./.*.K0BIHS0N.1KB.
