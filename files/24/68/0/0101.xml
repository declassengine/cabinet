-[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government]y^QD)^))     Printed for the War Cabinet.  November 1918.SECRET.MEMORANDUM AS TO NECESSITY FOR EXTENSION OF POWERS OFTHE MINISTER OF MUNITIONS.Circulated] by the Minister of Munitions.The possibility of an early cessation of hostilities, whether temporary or per-manent, involving a large reduction in the manufacture of war material, has madethe question of the present powers and duties of the Minister of Munitions, con-ferred upon him by Act of Parliament, and of how far such powers and dutieswould be adequate to meet the altered state of circumstances, a somewhat urgent onefor consideration.The Act under which the Minister was appointed, which was passed on the9th June, 1915, at a time when it was, perhaps, not contemplated that the operationsof the Ministry would become of such a far-reaching nature, provided that theMinister should be appointed for the purpose of supplying munitions for the presentwar, and (subsec. 2) that the Minister should have such administrative powersand duties in relation to the supply of munitions for the present war as might beconferred on him by His Majesty in Council. The Act further provided that theMinister&apos;s office and the Ministry should cease to exist on the termination of a periodof twelve months after the conclusion, of the present war, or such earlier day asmight be fixed by His Majesty in Council.For the purpose of enabling the Minister to carry out his duties, he was investedwith various powers of control, both over the manufacturing industries of the countryand over the supply of labour necessary for the purposes of those industries. Thesepowers, as to labour, were chiefly conferred by the Munitions of War Acts 1915-1917,and as to manufacture by the Defence of the Realm Consolidation Act 1914, and thevarious regulations which from time to time have been issued thereunder by HisMajesty in Council.Under section 1 of the Defence of the Realm Consolidation. Act, 1914, it isenacted that His Majesty in Council has power during the continuance of the presentwar to issue regulations for securing the public safety and the Defence of the Realm,and as to the powers and duties for that purpose, of the Admiralty and Army Counciland (under article 3 of the Ministry of Munitions Order in Council, 1915), theMinister of Munitions. The Act proceeds to authorise the trial and punishment ofpersons committing offences against regulations issued thereunder, in particularagainst a number of regulations which are set out in extenso in the Act, and which,as a joint result of the Act and an amendment made by the Munitions of War Act1915, sec. 10, include certain regulations of special importance, known as Regula-tions 1, 8, and 8 (A).Under Regulation 8 (A), the Minister has power(a.) To acquire any work in any factory or workshop to be done in accordancewith his directions, given with the object of making the factory or work-shop or the plant or labour therein as useful as -possible for the produc-tion of war material.(&amp;.) To regulate or restrict the carrying on of any work in any factory, work-shop, or other premises, or the engagement or employment of any work-men, or all or any classes of workmen therein, or to remove the planttherefdrm with a view to maintaining or increasing the production ofmunitions in other factories, workshops, or premises.In addition to the above-mentioned regulations specified in this Act, there havebeen a great number of regulations made by Order in Council, under which theMinister exercises his powers, all of which are made under the general powers con-ferred by the Act for securing the public safety and the Defence of the Realm, andcertain of which specifically allude to those powers or to the prosecution of the waras their object.Thus it will be seen that the present powers of the Minister are all confined tothe main object of the production of munitions of war necessary for the public safety[960] : &apos;
and Defence of tiie Realm, and considerable doubts have arisen as to. how far suchpowers could be relied on for continuing a control, however necessary,, which itmight have to be admitted was not for the purpose of the manufacture of munitions,but for that of demobilisation or reinstatement of peace industries. ^Having regard to the very far-reaching nature of the Minister&apos;s control c. fboth the manufacturing industries themselves and the raw materials and othersubstances forming their sources of supply, it would be impossible for such controlto be immediately relaxed without producing a state of. chaos and general disloca-tion of trade; moreover, in the case of a number of materials, such for example assteel, it will be essential for a considerable period after the cessation of hostilities,and probably after the termination of the war as defined by Mr. Justice Atkins&apos;Committee, to continue such control for the purpose of diverting these materialsinto the most necessary and profitable sources in the national interest.The Minister has recently come to the conclusion that it will probably benecessary, to a large extent, to discontinue the manufacture of shell steel, whichin itself is occupying a considerable portion of the activities of steel manufacturers;and if this were to be done, it would be essential to require them to divert this sideof their manufacturing activity into directions which would admittedly be for post-war purposes. So long as the continuation of hostilities is contemplated, manu-facturers are content to acquiesce in this control; but it is apprehended that whenonce the probability of further hostilities ceases, there would be a number of personsonly too ready to point to the fact that the powers of the Minister are closelyconfined by Statute to certain purposes as above mentioned, and to refuse to obeyorders which are clearly lawful so long as confined to such purposes, but of whichthe legality to say the least of it would be doubtful if sought to be applied forother, though none the less necessary, objects.It is in particular necessary to point out that the priority system which hasfound its way into practically the entire manufacturing industry of the UnitedKingdom, is based upon Regulation 8 (A) above mentioned, the object of which isexpressly stated as being the making of factories or workshops or the plant orlabour therein, as useful as possible for the production of war material.No doubt it is well capable of argument that the existing powers might besufficient to cover any reasonable measures taken to insure the keeping alive ofwar industries during the temporary period of an armistice; but on the other handit is felt that powers of a somewhat wider and less restricted nature than thosenow existing, may be necessary at an early period, if the control at present exercisedby the Ministry is not to be allowed to break down.A Parliamentary Committee has been established with a view to consideringthe necessity of continuing, during the post-war period, the operation of certainparts of the emergency legislation, but this Committee has not yet effectivelycommenced its labours, though reports have been prepared by the various Depart-ments for its use and submitted to the Ministry of Reconstruction; and it is feltby no means improbable that before the Committee can be in a position to announceits decisions upon a subject of such magnitude and importance, a crisis may arise,and the need for such extended powers as above indicated may be acutely felt. ;It is submitted that the two main points requiring immediate considerationare the following : (1.) The extension of the duties and powers of the Minister of Munitions asconferred by the Ministry of Munitions Act 1915, so as clearly toinclude the reinstatement of industries from a war basis to that of peace.(2.) The^extension of the general objects set out in the Defence of the RealmActs and Regulations, so as to make it clear that the powers therebyconferred are not confined to purposes inseparably connected with thepresent war, but are to be considered as extending to purposes conse-quential thereon and involved in the above suggested extensions of theMinistry of Munitions Act.It may be pointed out that although the iVdmiralty, the Army Council, andother Departments of State are also largely interested in any extension of theDefence of the Realm Acts and Regulations, nevertheless, owing to the fact thatsuch Departments are for the most part established on a more permanent basis, andwith more general objects than the Ministry of Munitions, the question of addi-tional powers is not likely, in their case, to take such an acute form.
