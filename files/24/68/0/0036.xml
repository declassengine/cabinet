(Memorandum &quot;by the liirii. s t e r of Re construction) vj The War Cabinet decided (Wo. 491, para.e) - &apos;nTo request the&quot;Minister of Reconstruction and the Minister of Labour to submit at an&quot;early date a summary of the &quot;powers which they would re-quire in order to&quot;carry out the work pi Demobilisation for which they required Cabinet&quot;sanction&quot;.I desire to point out that it is not possible to reduce the &apos;questions now requiring Cabinet decisions to a list of pov/ers. required.It will be seon by reference to my printed Memorandum (O.T.6047;)\ that theooints on which Cabinet authority is required comprise questions of-Volley, schemes of which details are given in the appendices of the.Memorandum (a. T. 6047), and. instructions to a number of Departments.It is&apos;, I think, obvious that the v/ar Cabinet have not the timeto go into these natters.     At tho same time, &quot;It is quite impossible forthe responsible Departments to proceed effectively to deal with theproblems of Demobilisation and. Resettlement as they affect officers andmen as well as civil war workers, until decisions are given4by theJovernment on tho following points, which I set out in the form ofrec oramenda t ions, vis:-(1). That approval be given to the four weeks1 discharge payment   ;and the unemployment benefit schemes for civil war -workersIand for demobilised/f oyoes, as recommended, in paragraphs (h)and (i) on Page 2 and. paragraphs (b) and (o) cn Page 3of G..T, 6.047,(2), That a decision by the Government should be announced regardingthe pledges to.....Trades Unions, in respect of Trades Unions .practices and an immediate discussion should, be arranged withthe Trades Unions and Employers as to a Bill embodying theminimum that is required in order to arrive at a workingsettlement for the transitional period;(3.). That a small body of. Ministers should be appointed with com-; plete authority to deal with (a) matters arising out of thopreceding, questions;    (b) the other proposals set out in.myMemorandum so far as they have net already been dealt with,and (c) any other matters connected with Demobilisation andIResettlement.     In particular, they should deal at once with\ the remaining points relating to Civil V/ar Pcur cora Resettlement,(4).. I suggest that this body of Ministers should consist of.theChancellor of the Jhccliequer, the Minister of Munitions, &quot;-theMinister of Labour and the Minister of Reconstruction,C. aDjIoOH&apos;.   &apos;39th October, 1918,
