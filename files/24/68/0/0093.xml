With the exception of a strike of Boilermakersat Liverpool and the Iron Ore Miners in Cumberland no strike of importance has occurred.(6) Not Involving a Stoppage of Work. The most important dispute still continuesto be that of the Surface workers in Wales. The trouble among the Aircraft Woodworkersat the Aintree National Factory is also acute.I. General Remarks.The Labour Situation.The position is at present unusually tranquil, the only two centres of anxiety beingWales, where the surface workers&apos; dispute continues, and Lancashire, where there is aserious strike among aircraft workers at the Aintree Factory.   Trouble is, however,     ,ianticipated among the members of the E.T.U. in the event of their claim before theCommittee on Production being rejected.  That claim was heard on Tuesday, 22nd instant.The surface workers&apos; claim for an eight hours&apos; day has now been agitated for a con-siderable time. The case is one of peculiar difficulty as some of the surface workers belong,to the South Wales Miners&apos; Federation, and are therefore bound by the Conciliation Boardagreement made in 1915, for the period 6f the war and six months thereafter, by whichpresent customs are to continue, while others do not belong to that organisation andare therefore not so bound. The Coal Controller met the Executive Council of the SouthWales Miners&apos; Federation and the Executive Committee of the Craftsmen&apos;s Associationseparately on 25th instant and offered a Government pledge to bring about a reductionof surface workers&apos; hours to 8-1 (when not already shorter) within six months of the con-clusion of peace. This proposal has not been accepted by the South Wales Miners&apos;Federation and the Coal Controller has now arranged to meet the Executive Council ofthe Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain and the National Council of Surface Workersand to place before them the proposals of the Government in the matter and offer thema national pledge, at the same time urging them to bring pressure on the District Authoritiesto maintain the status quo for the present.(C U79) A
2The trouble in the Aircraft industry is due to the policy of the woodworking unions,which oppose all piecework. This policy is by no means generally acceptable to theirmembers, many of whom have not only worked on this system in the past, but are hostileto the present attempt to confine them to time rates. Mass meetings have, however,now been held, at which it was decided to cease work on the evening of the 27th (subse-quently postponed to the 29th) unless the system of payment by results was abolished.Conferences are being held at the Ministry of Munitions, and it is hoped that someprovisional settlement will be reached.The claim of the Electrical Trades Union was iof enhanced rates of wages, and forthe inclusion in the award of certain grades of men who belong to another Union. It isreported that failure to concede the claim will probably result in an immediate strike,of the members of the Union.  The decision is expected in the course of the next few days.II. Pkess Comments.[k.)-Military,The Peace Notes.Discussion of the Peace Notes in the Pacifist Press seems very largely to revolve aroundthree points : (1) General anxiety lest, under pressure from the Allies and from his ownpeople, President Wilson should make additional demands upon Germany ; (2) The allegeddisagreement among the Allies as to the acceptance of Wilson&apos;s fourteen points ; (3)Dissatisfaction that peace has not already been concluded as the result of the first note.(1) Brailsford in an article in the &quot; Herald,&quot; entitled &quot; Raising the Terms,&quot; takes thefirst thesis as his text. He understands that the conditions of the armistice will involvethe occupation of the left bank of the Rhine, which he thinks would be tantamount torefusing an armistice altogether, and would certainly lead to the continuance of the warand the strengthening of the enemy&apos;s moral. The Austrian note also seems to foreshadowa stiffening of the terms, but if President Wilson thinks that hie is going to continue thewar until the Hohenzollerns have been dethroned he is certainly overshooting the mark.The &quot; Labour Leader &apos;&apos; threatens a revolution if any sympathetic weakness for the capitalistgreed of Allied Imperialists is allowed to betray the workers&apos; hope of a peace of Justiceand Freedom. In another article it is pointed out that if new stipulations are imposed, islittle reliance can be placed upon America&apos;s word as upon Germany&apos;s. The &quot; Call&quot; isconcerned about America&apos;s &quot; will to destruction,&quot; and the &quot; Bradford Pioneer &quot; is curiousto know whether Wijson will spring new demands upon Germany.(2) The majority of the papers appear to be quite convinced that the Allies as a wholedo not approve of the 14 points, and the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; expresses the hope that Wilsonwill show the same degree of firmness in dealing with the Allies as lie has already shownin his handling of the German Government. The President is in a position to dictate toboth, parties. The only question is whether he possesses sufficient strength to overcomethe militarists on his own side. Now that Germany has accepted the basis of settlementsuggested by him, it is for the Allies to state their adhesion to the same. The &quot; Herald&quot;thinks that our Huns want a continuance of the war in order that they may be able to holdthe working classes down by conscription. The Government requires a lead from thepeople, and failing that, in the event of the war being prolonged, they should try theirhand at a Revolution. The &quot; Call&quot; claims that the only reason why peace has not alreadybeen concluded is that the Allies are not prepared to unite on Wilson&apos;s 14 points. It alsoquestions the sincerity of President Wilson&apos;s motive who, despite his apparent desire forthe overthrow of autocracy, forms a member of the triumvirate of autocrats, the other twobeing Clemenceau and Lloyd George. The &quot; Bradford Pioneer &quot; also thinks that the 14points are a source of difficulty, but the secret treaties and the Paris Resolution are atany rate things of the past. &quot; Forward &quot; thinks that the fear of the spread of Bolshevismwill make for early peace, and that the Allied Imperialists are averse to any interferencewith the German ruling caste.(3) The &quot; Herald &quot; calls for immediate peace and exhorts the people, including themen in the trenches, to make their voices heard. Mr. Ramsay Macdonald considers thatPresident Wilson&apos;s 14 points shouted from the housetops lave won the war for democracy,and that peace is certain. He takes credit to the I.L.P. for all this. Wilson apparentlyhas merely adopted the policy which the I.L.P. has pressed on the Government ever sinceMay, 1915.
33-25&quot; Justice&quot; is still of the opinion that there should be no peace with the Hohen-zollerns, and the &quot; Clarion&quot; in a long article demands that the Kaiser, the Crown Prince,and other criminals in high places should be brought to trial, and if found guilty be capitallypunished.Lord Milner&apos;s Interview.All the Pacifist papers hail Lord Milner&apos;s expression of his views with acclamation.&quot; Forward &quot; regrets that he should have hesitated so long before making his views known,but congratulates itself upon his faithful imitation of I.L.P. principles.&quot; The &quot; Call&quot;thinks that the Revolution which we have fostered in Germany is not altogether to theliking of our ruling classes here. &quot; Justice &quot; criticises the expression of view as being amere financial plea for dealing lightly with the criminal.(B.) Foreign Affairs.Russia.Mr. R. C. Wallhead writing in the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; considers that Russia is the realobstacle to peace, and that British intervention was undertaken merely with a. view tosecure some of that country&apos;s wealth. The declaration of peace would remove all pretencefor this capitalistic intervention.The &quot;Labour Leader&quot; calls attention to the &quot;Times&quot; correspondent&apos;s testimonyof the popularity of the Bolshevik Government. &quot; Forward &quot; thinks &quot; that by our actionswe have thrown away our chances of having Russia as a friend.&quot; The revelations in theAmerican Press as to the supposed connexion between the German and the Bolshevikleaders are described as malicious forgeries. The &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot; gives adetailed description of the Kerensky-Korniloff plot and of the part taken in it by Mr.Browne of the American Red Cross. Mr. Browne is said to have admitted that the RedCross was in fact almost wholly a political mission, whose object was to upset the SovietGovernment and to bring Russia back into the war.(C.) Home Politics.New Separation Allowances.&quot; Both the &quot; Herald&quot; and the &quot; Labour Leader&quot; regard the new allowances asthoroughly inadequate and the procedure, especially in the case of unemployed women,as cumbrous and vexatious. The &quot; Herald,&quot; in an article entitled &quot; Our ParsimoniousMasters,&quot; demands a 100 per cent, increase, and the &quot; Labour Leader&quot; describes thecost as a mere bagatelle.Demobilisation.The &quot; Herald &quot; alleges that the unemployment of munition workers on the declarationof peace will be sudden and complete, that the Government have no plans ready, and thatthings will just drift.New Pensions Bill.The &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; in the course of an article on the Pensions autocrat, claims thatno self-respecting man or woman will ever serve on a Local Pensions Committee and submitto the amount of interference contemplated by the new Bill.(D.) Home Affairs.The Railway Strike.Two articles upon the strike appear in the &quot; Railway Review.&quot; The first entitledthe &quot; Ethics of the Strike &quot; is a defence of the men&apos;s action, in so far as the communityrefused to pay them an adequate wage. The Government&apos;s offer was accepted from asense of duty to the community, not from any respect for the Government. The secondarticle entitled &quot; Black Week,&quot; appeals to the men not to be influenced by irresponsiblehot heads, but to trust their accredited leaders.(C 1479) A 2
4III. District Reports.London and South Eastern.The trouble threatened last week in the aircraft and electrical works has not yetmaterialised.Some unrest exists at the Perivale Inspection Department, Park Royal, owing tothe stoppage of night work. ,At a meeting of the A.S.E. Shop Stewards on October 2nd a resolution was passeddemanding the abolition of the payment by results system throughout the London District,and requesting the Ministry of Munitions to remove the embargo on increases in the flatrate, the London District Committee of the A.S.E. has recently issued a letter to thevarious shops asking them to express their opinion on the above resolution.West Midlands.The situation remains quiet in this district.It is reported that, as a result of the numerous strikes at Coventry, orders are beingplaced elsewhere ; and the consequent slackness in the engineering shops is causing someunrest among the workers.Yorkshire and E. Midlands.Acute unrest is reported in the Clothing trade at Leeds. The Garment Workersare demanding increased war boziuses, while the Jewish sub-contractors applied for an.increase of 30 per cent, which the Clothiers refused to grant.Some discontent prevails among the Yorkshire miners, and several grievances arereported. Surfacemen at a number of pits are stated not yet to have been paid theincreased scale of wages recently granted. The removal of men employed at the pitsfrom one class of work to another where lower wages are paid, and the question of workingwith non-union men, are further causes of trouble in some districts.North Western.Unrest in this area is becoming more serious ; and is especially acute at the AintreeAircraft Factory, and at the Cumberland Iron Ore Mines where a strike has been in progressduring the week.At a meeting of the Mersey District Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades Federationon October 27th it was decided that the members should touch no work connected withaircraft construction until the dispute at the Aintree Factory was settled, nor shouldthey do any work which would otherwise have been done by the woodworkers, who arethreatening to strike. It is stated that the other trades in the district (including theFederated trades), although in sympathy, will not support the woodworkers to the extentof striking.It is reported that the War Munition Volunteers at Barrow are preparing a demandfor an increase in their allowance from 17s. Qd. to 25s. The opinion has been expressedthat this would be an opportune moment for the Government to transfer the.men backto their own towns, as their services can be dispensed with, and thus the Governmentwould be saved the unnecessary extra expense of the subsistence allowance.Northern.It is reported that the situation in Newcastle and district is very satisfactory andthere are no signs, of any impending trouble.South Wales.The strike of the miners in support of the surface workers&apos; demand for an eight hourday spread during the week. On the 25th, however, the miners at Amman Valley andGwaun Cae Gurwen, decided to resume work.Scotland.With the exception of the agitation over the premium bonus system in the shipyards,,no unrest is reported from this district.The National (Scottish) Industrial Council have issued ballot papers to the districtsfor the election of the various officials of the Council.It is reported that the.Labour and Co-operative Council in Glasgow will start anational campaign next month in support of larger pensions and allowances for servicemen and their dependents.
5IV.-Disputes.(a) Involving a Stoppage of Work.The Admiralty Labour Department reports three fresh stoppages.On October 23rd, 600 men struck at Clover Olayton&apos;s, Liverpool, owing to the refusal ofthe boilermakers to work with eight Australians unless the latter joined the BritishBoilermakers&apos; Union. Work was resumed on October 29th, the Australians agreeing tojoin the British society under certain conditions.The Ministry of Munitions reports that 3,518 workers are on strike, and seven strikesremained unsettled on 23rd October.In the majority of strikes reported, work had been resumed before the end of theweek.The aircraft woodworkers employed at Messrs. McLaughlin and Harvey, Belfast, struckon October 23rd, demanding the dismissal of the women dilutees.The Coal Controller reports 14 new stoppages for the week ending 29th October. Ineight cases work has already been resumed.1There have been a considerable number of stoppages in South Wales for apparently trivialcauses. No collieries, however, are now idle in connection with the eight hours&apos; demand of thesurface workers, the stoppages in the anthracite district reported last week lasting only twodays. - iThe War Office Contracts Department reports that a temporary strike of the cutterstook place last week at Messrs. Schneider&apos;s, but that the men returned to work on thecommand of their Union. A strike has since occurred at Messrs. Lotery&apos;s; the UnionExecutive has threatened to expel these men from the Union unless they obey itsinstructions.&quot;Reported from Other Sources.The strike at the Iron Ore Mines, Cumberland, continued during the week, but an earlyresumption of work is expected. It has been arranged that all men working in the Iron Oremines during the war shall belong to the Cumberland Iron Ore Miners and Kindred TradesAssociation.It is reported that about 80 employees of Messrs. Yarrow and Company, Scotstown, have leftwork owing to a dispute over the premium bonus system.(6) Not Involving a Stoppage.The Admiralty Labour Department reports considerable disturbance owing to thejoiners refusing to work on systems of payment by results.At Messrs. J. W. Brooks, Lowestoft, and Messrs. J. W. Cochrane and Sons, Selby, bythreatening to strike, the joiners have succeeded in effecting the substitution of time rates forpiece rates.The most important dispute reported by the Ministry of Munitions is that of theJoiners at the National Aircraft Factory, Aintree.As a result of pressure brought to bear by their trade union officials, 111 woodworkersare reported to have given notice to cease work on October 29th.Members of the A.S.E. in Swansea and district are stated to have ceased to work overtimebecause their demand for a 47-hour week has not been conceded.Fresh trouble is reported at the Lilac Mill Alliance Aircraft Factory, Oldham.

Thepoints in dispute have been referred to arbitration.The Coal Controller reports two important cases.The miners in the Forest of Dean Collieries threaten to strike on November 4th unlessWilliam Hoare is reinstated at the colliery from which he was dismissed. It is also reportedthat the Firemen and Overmen&apos;s Association also threaten to strike on that date, owing to therefusal of the owners to allow overmen to become members of this Association.   .The Executive Committee of the South Wales Miners&apos; Federation have refused to acceptthe Coal Controllers proposal that a reduction of surfacemen&apos;s hours should be arranged withinsix months of peace, and they recommend their members to cease work after an 8  hours shift-each day, after a certain date, if their demands are not granted.
