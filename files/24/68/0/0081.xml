INTER-ALLIED PROGRAMME FOR THE IMPORTATION OF HORSES.IOLDING   UP   1. GENERAL SACKVTLLE-WEST in opening the meeting asked theP THEUPPLY OF10AL TOmItalian Military Representative to express hisview of the amended draft Note.GENERAL di ROBILANT read the amended version of theDraft Joint Note made as the result of the lastmeeting.The only comment he had to make was that asthere was a question of possible &quot;force majeuro&quot;he proposed a modified last paragraph to thefollov/ing effect :-&quot;It- 1 - -
2. ftQ rj&quot;It is absolutely necessary in order as faras possible to avoid similar interruptions infuture, that the ccal supply to Italy as laiddown in the present working programme, shouldhe considered froai the transport point of view asa matter cf urgent   common military interest.&quot;He proposed to a3k Major Valenziani to explainthe circumstances which had led to the present srisis.MAJOR VALENZIANI explained that &quot;by reason of two suspensionsof traffio ordered by the French Authorities, thedeficit in coal for Italy, which, on the 15th Octoberamounted to 61,000 tons, had considerably increased inthe last few days and would, as a consequence of theaboure mentioned suspend ens, continue to increase.   From,the 17th to the 22nd, all coal for Marseilles had &quot;beenstopped.   On the 17th and 18th there had &quot;been a generalstoppage of railway transport in Fiance, and. thisgeneral stoppage had included the coal for Italy,   Inother   words, it had included ccal from Marse &apos;.lles toItaly.   It was desirable that such interruptions infuture should he avoided seeing the great damageoaused to war industries and military transports inItaly.   At any rate, should such necessities arisein future, some agreement should &quot;be reaohed betimesbetween the Italian and French Authorities, in orderto concert measures for minimising the resulting harm.The Inter-Allied Transportation Council had expresseditself in this cense and it was desirable that itshould receive the &quot;backing of the Supreme War Council.GENERAL di R0BILA1TT said that the Minister of Transport had&quot;apparently accepted this solution in principle.GENERAL BELDT said that he ,felt some doubt of the correctnessof the account he had just heard:   As far as he wasaware traffic had not been suspended for 5 or 6 days&quot;but only for 2 days, the 17th and 18th.   He hadreceived information to this effect only the day &quot;beforeand was told that the facts had been explained at ameeting at which the Italian Ambassador was present.MAJOR VALEHZIAH . said that he had been present at the meetingGENERAL BELIN said that he was able to state positively&quot;&quot;%hat traffic had only been stopped for 2 days..   Therewere two ways of supplying Italy.   Coal v/as sentfrom French mines to Marseilles for shipment thencein Italian ships.   Goal waa also sent from Bordeauxin trucks which Italy returned empty,   On the 15ththere had &quot;been at Marseilles 559 trucks of ooal,undischarged by the Italians; on the 16th there had&quot;been 417; on the 17th, 469,   Hence the station atMarseilles was blocked and the trucks remained outof use.   It was clearly not worth while to send moreooal there and make the confusion worse.   Luring the15th and 16th rolling stock returned to Bordeaux ofthe carrying capacity of 51,000 tons; neverthelessin those days 110,000 tons had been 3ent, therolling
9 Q 9.i) W U- 3rolling stock for which had been supplied by,the French,though this rolling stock was urgently needed for other-&apos;traffic,        This being the case he thought that Stancehad done its very utmost,MAJOR VAjLENZIANI said that at the request of the French Minister.-   of&quot; Transports, the Italian Government delegate at Marseilleshad come to Paris,   Together with the Italian Ambassadorhe had met ii., Clareillo and explained that the stock at theport of Larseilles could not be imputed to the Italianauthorities, a3 trains from the mines were not arrivingregularly by reason of the traffic crisis^   However truckswere accumulating at Marseilles in numbers which theavailable unloading resources could not cope with.     Asuspension of activity was therefore inevitable, but had itbeen arranged for beforehand in concert with the Italianand French authorities at Marseilles it would not have lasted6 days.   The figures in General Belin&apos;s possession showedthat after the fourth day the number of loaded trucks hadbeen reduced to a hundred, ive, the normal number of Italiancoal trucks present in the port,   The prolonging of thesuspension of issue from the mines hadincreased the deficit,.as the time taken after the resumptionof traffic, for the journey . from the mineB to afareeilies,must be counted.The French and Italian authorities had come to anagreement on this question of detail, but it was desirablefor the future that any restrictions the French authoritiesmight be compelled to make should be- pre-arranged with theItalian authorities, in respect to Italian coal, Whichshould at least be included in the list of exceptions incases of suspended, traffic.   That was the object of thelast paragraph of the draft Joint Note.GENERAL BELIN said that the fact remained that &quot;force majeure&quot;could not be countered by the Military Representatives anymore than by. the Governmentsu   It was for this reason thathe wished to omit the last paragraph of the Joint Note.   Thetwo days&apos; stoppage was entirely a matter of railwaymanagement, and it did not appear to him necessary tomobilize the Allied Governments for a question of this sort.GENERAL BLISS said that he had only one observation to make.He &quot;thought that it was unwise for the Military Representativesto be constantly urging an individual Government to do whatthey had reason to believe it was doing to the best of itsability,GENERAL SA0KV1LLE-TOT said that at the previous meeting he hadagreed in pHncTple to the Note and ho was ready to sign itwith or without the last paragraph though the omission of thisparagraph perhaps robbed.the note of its interest.GENERAL. EELI.N said that as there had been an improvement in theTonnage situation a new study of the question might be worth-  undertaking, and that it was worth while to draw attentionto
to this aspect of the case.   For instance theliberation of Dunkirk and Calais from enemy threatmight lead to the use of these ports as   Britishbases and to the consequent release of Havrefor other traffic.      It was not therefore thecase of inviting the Governments to do what theywere already doing but to initiate a study ofnew conditions.      This did not apply to thelast paragraph and lie therefore maintained hieobjection to it.GEI^KAL di RfrBILMT said that the last paragraph dealtwith the future and that for this reason he wishedto keep it.(The British and American Representativessignified their agreement to sign theJoint Note with or without the lastparagraph).GENERAL KBiLIN then suggested a variant draft ;-11 IT IS NECESSARYthat the coal supply for Italy as laiddown in the present working programme,should be considered from the point of viev/of transport as a matter of ^joint militaryint erest,&quot;GENERAL BLISS enquired whether this version gave coal&quot;for Italy priority over supplies for British,French anc imerican troops in Italy.GENERAL BSLIff said that this was not the effect of thedraft,&apos;    Coal would take its appropriate place onthe priority list, but it could not be excludedfrom shipment by any general commercial regulation.(The Joint Note as amended was then accepted.)(For text of Joint. Note No,39. see Annexure &quot;A&quot;).2. INTER-ALLIED
3005.GENERAL SACKVILLJ-1I3T asked the French MilitaryRepresentative to explain the situation.GENERAL BELjN said that in his covering letter he hadgiven full explanatory details.   In order tosatisfy. Marshal Foch who wanted to put in theField the maximum of American troops in theshortest possible time the conveyance of horsesfrom the United States had been suppressed, theAmerican Army therefore being provided for hyFrance.   Thus, since October, 1917, 136,880horses and mules had been delivered by France to *the United States Army.   In Juno and July last165,000 horses had been requisitioned in France.France to recoup herself required 20,000 horsesa month.   With the utmost pressure only 10,000could be obtained:   Agriculture was suffering, soalso was civilian  .road transport, and this iedto the blocking of stations from which goodscould not be removed-   It was for this reasonthat the request for horses from the Argentinewas urged.   He therefore asked that a draftresolution referring the matter to the AlliedMaritime Transport Council should be passed andhe suggested that the resolution should be con-side red first. .GENERAL di RQBILANT, said that the question was asimple one.   The French Government had alreadyregistered a demand and the Military Representa-tives were asked to support it.   He was ready todo so.GENERAL BLISS enquired whether, from a military pointof view,  it-would not be preferable to importhorses from the United States rather than fromthe Argentine.   There was a large quantity ofsupplies in the United States awaiting shipmentto France.   Horse transports were able to bringother supplies as well as horses.   There wouldtherefore, be a waste of tonnage if the horseswere brought from the Argentine instead of from.   the United States.GENERAL BELIN said that&apos;he h&amp;d mentioned this questionin circulating his draft Joint Uote.   The FrenchGovernment had made an application for the pur-ohase of these horses in America and it was at- the request of the American Authorities them-selves that thi3 plan had not been carried out.GENERAL BLISS asked that it be put on record that the5,000 horses a month required by France could notbe obtained in the United States.   With, thisproviso and the further condition that the ton-nage required did not interfere with the AmericanShipping Programme, he was prepared to agree toparagraph        As to paragraph 2, he thought itwould be a mistake for the Military Representativesto make any recommendations to the War PurchasesCommittee.   This should &quot;be done by the appropriateMinister.   He wished to explain to the Meetingthat for some months he had been at variance withMr. Crosby.   The latter wished the Military Repre-sentativea to pass resolutions concerning themilitary
necessity of every purchase placed &quot;before his Committee,If the Military Representatives were to consent to this,the whole business of the War Purchases Committee r/ould beunloaded on them.   On one occasion Mr. Crosby had receiveda request for motor-cars to be U3cd by the British Governsment in Mesopotamia.   Mr. Crosby had taken the attitudethat unl&amp;33 General Bliss declared this order to &quot;be ofmilitary neoessity it would, not be accepted.   GeneralBliss had.declined to undertake this responsibility andhad stated that were he Chairman of the Inter-Allied WarPurchases Committee and had received a request of thiskind from the British Government through its author!664representative, he would accept it provided it were withinthe limits of the American Government&apos;s power to satisfyit.   He therefore thought it would be a mistake to intro-duce this paragraph in the, resolution unless the FrenchGovernment were convinced that it could not obtain theoredit otherwise.   M- Loucheur was a member of the WarPurchases Committee and he need only make the demand himself.GENERAL BEL IN then read a letter from M* Clemenceau (See Annexure&quot;E&quot; ) ,He pointed out that French credits in the Argentinehad been exhausted and that the United States GovernmentFas asked to give assistance in the purchase of horsesthere for that reason.GENERAL BLISS   said that this did not really alter the question.French credits were exhausted in the Argentine and theFrench Government wished credit to be allocated to it fromthe United States.   It did not matter to the AmericanGovernment where these credits were spent.   Hence, if theFrench Government required credits all that was requiredwas that a French Minister should apply for them, otherwiseMr. Crosby would seize the opportunity of sending everydemand he receivedto the Military Representatives in orderthat they should decide whether it was of military urgency.GENERAL BELIN said that his Government had empowered a Ministerto a&amp;k&apos;for these credits but thought that the backing ofthe Military Representatives would be of assistance.GENERAL 3ACKVIILE-WEST said that he agreed with General Bliss.If the Military Representatives had to decide on themilitary urgency of every order down to the supply ofboots they would be greatly hampered in their work and sucha task would interfere with the smooth working of the war.GENERA! BLISS   explained that the case in point might be a 3impleone but unfortunately it might Idad to others.   For instance,seven days before the German offensive on the 2lst March hehad been unofficially present at a meeting of the WarPurchases Committee in London.   One of the Allied Govern-ments had presented a demand for lorries.   Mr. Crosbyremarked that Marshal Haiti had a big reserve of lorriesand suggested that the Military representatives shouldintervene to transfer this reserve from Marshal Haig to theGovernment reqai/-! ng In em,   He took this view in order tosave American men yf   C-eneral Bliss h^d declined to takeaction as he considered it was no part of the duty of theMilitary Representatives to supplant any Commander-in-Chief.   Mr. Crosby wished to wage war economically and ifpossible at its conclusion to have nothing but worn materialand no unused stock in hand.   General Blis3 took the con-trary view.
9 0?O V w- 1 -GENERAL BELIN said that this incident encouraged him to thinkthat as MroCrosby had been saved from making a mistake bythe advice of General Bliss, it was fitting that he shouldagain receive advice from the Iiilitary Representatives.He also wished to quote a letter ho had received fromGeneral Petain. (Bee Anncxure &quot;D&quot;)u     This letter showedthe very special urgency of this particular case.GENERAL BLISS then said that he would accept the Resolution withthe proviso previously mentioned that the United Statestrooping programme be not interfered with.GMERAh SaGICVILLE-^EST said that it would be possible to agreeto paragraph 1 and to defer paragraph 2 for furtherreflection.     As the two paragraphs were addressed todifferent Committees it would riot be difficult to separatethem,GENERAL BELIN said that difficulty would arise. as tho purchasingof horses would be delayed by the lack of credit.GENERAL S A C RVIL IE- Vi/EST said that if paragraph 2 were accepted itshould be clearly indicated that the case was quiteexceptional, and that he suggested the appending of GeneralPetain1s letter (See Annexure &quot;Dn),GENERAL BLISS said he inferred that the- request had already beenmade to Mr.,Crosby, who was probably reluctant to act andwho had possibly said that he wished to have the opinionof the Military Representatives,     The MilitaryRepresentatives should protect themselves against theestablishment of this incident as a precedent.     They coulddo this best by explaining the particular reasons why theymado a recommendation in this instance.He then proposed a proviso to the draft resolution.This was accepted and forms the last paragraph of theresolution as finally agreed on.     He was prepared eitherto have this passage inserted or to inform his Governmentthat he had agreed to the resolution on that express under-standing,(It was agreed that the -proviso should be insertedin the resolution and the resolution as amended wasfinally accepted - for text of &quot;&quot;which see Anne xure wBn)sItER^ALLIEP GENERAL BELIN said he would now ask his colleagues to proceedGGRAMHE to consider the second part of his proposals relating toR THE the importation of horses*   He had submitted these inPQKTATIOfl      the form of a draft Joint Note (Annexuro nCn)u&quot; HORSES. Tho purchase of horses in the Argentine would only&quot;supply a part of the French requirements,,     Not only theDraft Joint   French, but all tho Allies, including the Americans and- N0-kG .        British, would require to import horses, and. his informationwont to show that the British Army alone would require some10,000 horses monthly*   This being tho case, it would beextremely difficult for the Alliod Maritime TransportCouncil to decide on the priority to be given to all thedemands which would be madesIn
- In order to solve this difficulty it would bo best for thoAllies to prepare a common programme.    , The proposalhich he had put forward was not altogether an innovation.Similar action h:*d be on taken in various cases.     ?orinstance, an inter-allled transport (lorries) reserve hadboon formed.     Also a general reserve of artillery.And lately the idea of forming an inter-allied Aviationforce had bo;ni accepted.     Similarly, a general reserveof horses could be made, and the distribution of horsesso brought together could bo carried out by the Inter-Alliod Committee attached to harShal iJ*ooh&apos;s Headquarters.In this way tho requirements of the French, British andAmerican Armies would best be inot.GkNNiVAh di ROBILaNT wished most emphatically to point out thattho&apos; Italian -army now found itself in exactly the sameposition&apos;as that of the Allies,     Italy now had a deficitof 40,000 horses and their requirements amounted to 3,000monthly.     Thoy had contracts for the purchase of 300horses a month in the Argentine and 2,500 in the UnitedStates of Americaft     But they could not get tho tonnagefor their transportation.     Therefore, a special agreementhad been entered into with the United states of America inaccordance with which a small number of horses (some 400 or500 a month) could bo brought over in ships carrying othersupplies.     Under those conditions, ho would ask that Italyshould be included in the proposals coiitairod in GeneralEel in-&quot;s draft Joint Note, so that the requirements of Italymight bo taken into consideration in the study to beundertaken.     He would therefore formally propose theaddition of the word &quot;Italian1&quot; in paragraph (a) and theaddition of the word &quot;Italy&quot; in paragraph (l) of the draft&apos;Jo^int No to,OiMBAL BLISS said that the Nrcnch Military Representative hadreferred to the organisation of a reserve of lorries andaeroplanes under Marshal Joch.     It should be noted thatthese reserves were formed subject to the requirements ofthe different Armies being fully met in the first place.He assumed that nothing was taken from the British, Frenchor Italian Armies which was necessary for their own work.In the case under consideration they wore asked to make goodan existing deficit.Paragraph (a) of the draft Joint Note referred merely toimports frommAmcrica,     He would enquire whether the terraAmerica meant the United States of America or the whole oftho Continent of America.     If the Continent of America wasintended, then the 5,000 horses which had formed the subjectof the resolution, which &quot;had just been accepted, would besubject to the distribution now proposed.GENERAL 3NIIN explained that the term America must relate-to thewhole 6x the&apos;-American Continent.     The resolution whichthey had accepted was intended merely to make good the urgentrequirements of the moment,     whearcas the Joint Note nowunder consideration asked for q study with a view to starting;a now -organisation.GLILRaL BLISS
394- 9 -GjjiLt^ui-I hLIsS acoopted Goneral Bolin&apos;s explanation,   He desiredto point out that the question of pooling all militarysupplies had boon urgently considered some time ago and&apos; some agreement had boon arrived at to which Great Britainwas a party.     He did not know what particular materialshad been included in that agreement, nor whether horses hadbeen included or purposely excluded.     He would invite thoattention of his colleagues to the fact, however, thatwhilst paragraph (a) of the Note referred to imports ofhorses from America, paragraph (1) related.to all animalsrequired during a fired period by the different AlliedArmies j whether imported from America, the United Zingdom.South Africa or elsewhere.     He thought that paragraph (aJshould refer to all importations from any sources by any ofthe Allies.     At any rate it would be necessary toreconcile paragraphs (a) and (1).When the question of pooling all supplies was underconsideration, an agreement had been reached betweenMarshal 3*0 ch and General Per shing.     He did not knowwhether that agreement included horses or not and, if not,why not,GENERAL BhhlN replied that he could not give any information onthis point,GENERAL BLISS continuing said that as regards the horses comingfrom the United States of America,&apos; for tho completion of theequipment of the United States Army, the proposed draftJoint Note raised a very important question.     Indiscussing the question of pooling supplies it had been a-     .   -agreed that only supplies over and above the actualnecessities of the Armies in France should be pooled..     If,therefore, the question was now taken up in respect of .,one important item of supply, and if they now proposedto disregard the actual requirements of tho Armies, thequestion, would at once arise as to why they should notpool all other supplies, as well as the sources of supply,the manufactories.     On receipt-of General BelinTsdraft Joint Note last. Saturday, he had . telegraphed toGeneral rershing for his views, knowing that GeneralIershingrs views would be conclusive with his Government,Early this morning he had received tho following telegram :&quot;In reply to your telegram of yesterday I cannotconsult General iershing at present but I am satisfiedthat his views aro that the need of the American&apos;.&apos;Lspoditionary IPoroos. for horses is much greater even thanthat of iranee,   wc are now short 130,000 horses andthis shortage will continue to grow.&apos; We have artillerybrigades trained, armed and ready to function that aroimmobilised from lack of horses and we have -divisionsthat are immobile for the same reason.   After cuttingrequirements for animals to the lowest possible limit womust have a minimum of 30,000 per month for tho next eightmonths,&apos;    Practically all of these must be brought from thoUnited States.     Cablegram received today states formerestimates of War Department were &quot;based on 500,000 tons of-   British shipping being available for November loading andincluded tonnage required for animals.     Revised capacitybased on only 150,000 tons British shipping loading inNovember&quot;.     It appears wasteful of tonnage to bringanimals from Argentine Republic if the United States canfurnish ail the animals necessary.     If they come from theUnited States the same ships can also bring a partialcargo of military supplies.     Allotment of shipping forthe importation of animals for the French ;,rmy should takefully
3 n %D- 10before the id raised perhaps one of the biggest suggestionsthat had been put forward during the war after the&apos;handing over of tho Allied Armies to one Coinmandor-in-Ohiefo     To hand over the transportation re sources ofthe Allies to a particular Committee practically meantputting all Allied ships under one authority.     It wasimpossible in reality to separate cargo space for horsesfrom cargo space for wheat.     Therefore, before he couldeven express a view on this question, he would requirea great deal more information.     He would also requireto study the question very carefully before he couldsuggest to his Government the handing over of the wholeof the British Mercantile Marine to a Committee *    Horsosand mules did not come only from America, they also camefrom India and all over the world, and beyond saying thathe was prepared to examine the question most carefully,ho was not prepared at the moment to express any definiteview,IsiSflEBAIi 3RLIN suggested, under these circumstances, that thefully into consideration our own imperative need.The main consideration, however, is to get tho animalsI to franco,     General l-ershing has always favoured thepolioy of pooling supplies, and if the plan adoptedwill got the animals.and not discriminate against ourhoods it will undoubtedly meet with his support&quot;.Inoonclusion, therefore, he would accept theprinciple of pooling, provided it did not interferewith the equipment of the American Army-.GENERAL SAGI vILLE-V.(BST said that the draft Joint Note nowquestion be further studied after taking note of theobservations which had been made during the course ofthe Meeting.GKE&amp;RAL di ROBILMT agreed and added that it would benecessary also for them to prepare statements showingthe requirements of all the Armies,.(In order to admit oi.further detailed studyof the questions involved, the kilitaryRepresentatives postponed for considerationat a subsequent Meeting, &quot;thc^raft Joint&quot;IIo t o Bubinitted by the French kootionH
