Political Intelligence Department,o * u   oo ,ftlo Foreign Office.October 28, 1918.Russia/016./2- MEMORANDUMA /lb &quot;gaTHE POLITICAL SITUATION IN TRANS-CAUCASIA.[This Memorandum is issued in continuation of Memorandum Russia, 006, and dealswith recent events in Trans-Caucasia and their bearing on the relations betweenGeorgians, Armenians, and Tatars, and their future relation to Russia. In particular,attention is directed to the dominant role played by the Georgians, their presentrelation to Germany, and the possibility of detaching them. See also MemorandumTurkey, 006.]THE revolution of March 1917 seems to have been more immediately productive ofdesirable positive results, at least temporarily, in Trans-Caucasia than in any other regionof the Russian State with the possible exception of Esthonia. This was in great part dueto the enterprise and comparative political maturity of the Georgians (see below), whoseconstituent National Assembly met for the tirst time on the 19th November, 1917, inTiflis. The evidence of the possibility of good understanding between the principalnational elements in Trans-Caucasia was seen in the formation of a general Trans-Caucasian Government following on the declaration of independence of the country as awhole, which was a definite reply to the Bolshevik coup of the 9th Novemberon the part of a region characteristically non-Bolshevik. This Governmentwas faced, however, with an insuperable task. To begin with, the possibility of apermanent harmonious understanding between Georgians, Armenians, and Tatars wasto the liking neither of Turkey nor Germany. Indeed ever since the revolution, Turkeythrough her agents had sought to permeate Eastern Trans-Caucasia and the NorthernCaucasus, using Mohammedan mullahs as her propagandists, for she was afraid that aTrans-Caucasian republic including Georgians, Tatars, and Armenians would separateher from the Tatars in more than a geographical sense, hinder her penetration ofTurkestan and eventually develope into a formidable entity which could not be treatedas a subservient vassal. Germany, on the other hand, had already decided upon adefinite policy which she wished to follow with regard to Georgia.Of the numerous items in the programme of the new Government (4th December)one was peculiarly urgent. &quot; Recognising the maintenance of unity of the generalRussian front,&quot; it ran, &quot; the Trans-Caucasian Government Commissioners will take mostenergetic steps towards the immediate conclusion of peace, being guided in thisdirection by the general conditions obtaining on the Western front, by theconditions of local life, and in agreement with the wishes of the peoples inhabitingthe Caucasus.&quot; These local conditions were sufficiently grave. The Russian armyon the Caucasian front had been given the order to demobilise, but alreadygreat numbers of deserters had been moving to the rear, plundering and destroying asthey went. Anarchy was rapidly increasing and the Bolshevik movement progressing.The Trans-Caucasian Government wished to defend their frontiers with Georgian andArmenian troops, but this involved reorganisation and meantime the front was givingway. Accordingly negotiations were begun on the initiative of the Commander-in-chiefof the Turkish army between him and General Prjevalsky, the Commander-in-chief ofthe army of the Caucasus, for an armistice on the whole of the Caucasian front.The latter was &quot; compelled to take the step (of agreement) in consequence of thegeneral political conditions obtaining in Russia &quot; : a clause provided against any utilisationof the situation to tbe detriment of the Allies in Mesopotamia and elsewhere. Itappears, however, that the Turks did not keep their part of whatever bargain wasactually made. The growing restiveness on the part of the wealthier Tatar landedproprietors against the socialistic proposals of the Government facilitated the work ofthe Turkish and other agents in sowing distrust in particular between the Tatars andArmenians. It was not in human nature that the jealousies and hatreds of centuriesshould be completely eradicated in the course of a few months.   The secret co-operation[367-48] B
2of the Tatar with the Turks was accompanied by a greater tendency on the partof the Tatar elements to dissociate themselves from the general policy of the Trans-Caucasian. Government. The Turks continued to advance and sent a detachmenttowards Baku with a view to getting into direct contact with the chief Tatar centre.With the threat to Datum, the Trans-Caucasian Government was quite ready to enterinto negotiations at Trebizond.The Trebizond Negotiations.Accordingly at a meeting of, the Trans-Caucasian Diet on the 16th February,1918, it was unanimously decided to cany on peace negotiations with Turkey. Thedeparture of the representative delegation headed by Tchkhenkeli for Trebizond waspostponed because a telegram was received that the Brest-Litovsk Treaty was to besigned the following day, in accordance with which Batum, Kars, and Ardahan weremade over to Turkey.   The delegation wished to make enquiries on this point.The surrender of these provinces came as a surprise to the Georgians, as theseprovinces are inhabited by some 350,000 Mohammedan Georgians who had been hithertoguided by motives of nationality rather than religion. Further, according to thetreaty of 1783 Russia undertook to return to Georgia all her provinces recovered fromTurkey, which were subsequently ceded to Russia by the Berlin Congress of1878. So far as the point in equity is concerned, it is therefore hardly a question of&quot; disaunexation.&quot; Indeed, the Turkish Government, before entering this war on theside of Germany, offered to the Georgians to include these provinces in the futureState of Georgia and also to give the province of Lazistan as far as i the vicinity ofTrebizond, which she has occupied since 1466. The very fact that the Turkish Govern-ment negotiated the surrender of these provinces with the Bolsheviks at Brest-Litovsk,and not with the Trans-Caucasian Government, shows that she was perfectly aware ofthe character of her actions. ,At the outset of the Conference (the 1st March) the Turks were asked if theevacuation of Kars, Batum, and Ardahan was an intimation of a. refusal to continuenegotiations. Apparently a direct answer was not forthcoming. The Trans-Caucasiandelegation were simply told that the Turkish representatives had come to Trebizoncito lay the conditions and requirements of the Porte before them. These were on thelines of wishing; to conclude a lasting peace with Trans-Caucasia, and for that purposethe Turkish delegation had been invested with full powers. Indirect pressurewas, however, applied from the beginning, and the conference was presided overthroughout by the Turkish delegation, Rauf Bey.The Turkish delegates then asked for precise information with regard to thestatus of the Trans-Caucasian Government and the Republic which it represented.They were told that after the Bolshevik revolution in Caucasia, a new and independentGovernment had arisen, responsible to the Diet, and that the Trans-Caucasia Republicwas already established with a Government which had entered into internationalrelations, and which protested against the Brest-Litovsk Treaty, concluded withoutits consent, although it was the case that no notification of the independence of thisGovernment had been sent to the Powers.At a subsequent meeting the Turkish delegation refused to accept this position,and while not denying that a treaty concluded between two Governments could haveno. value in relation to a third, insisted that if Trans-Caucasia wished to profit by therules of international law, a Government should have been formed in concordance withthe principles of international law, and steps taken towards its acknowledgment by theother Powers. It further declared that the trans-Caucasian Government, in anultimatum of the 23rd January, on the necessity of regulating its actions in accordancewith the conduct of other territories which formed part of the Russian Federal Republic,and by the fact that it had not sent representatives to the Brest-Litovsk confsr-ence, had shown that it did not consider itself an independent Government, but amember of that Republic. (As a matter of fact the Trans-Caucasian Government hadwished to send delegates to Brest-Litovsk, as did the Ukraine, but nothing was donethrough the active refusal of the Tatar delegates to have anything to do with thematter.) The Turkish Government knew that a Government was in process offormation in Trans-Caucasia, and that it wished to be independent of Russia, but up tothe present time there were only Russian troops on the Trans-Caucasian front.&apos;Accordingly the Turkish delegation, rejected the statement of. the Trans-CaucasianG overnment on the invalidity of the Brest-Litovsk Treaty in&apos; so far as it related to theCaucasus.
In reply, the Trans-Caucasian Government pointed out that the Turkish Govern-ment had recognised the Trans-Caucasian Government in addressing itself to it from itshead-quarters on the 1st/14th January, in respect to a conclusion of peace betweenTurkey and the Caucasus; and later had notified that it was ready to send its delegatesto conclude a peace conference, and to sign a treaty for the conclusion of peace. TheTrans-Caucasian delegates held to their position that they now were actually engaged asrepresentatives of a Government in peace negotiations with Turkey, in order*to settlethe consequences of the war between Russia and Turkey so far as it concerned them-selves, with a view to a lasting peace, but insisted that before any ratification of a peacetreaty were possible, the independent Trans-Caucasian Government must be recognisedwith all the formalities required by international law. Apparently the Trans-Caucasiandelegates had gone prepared to treat with the Ottoman delegation as equals, bearingtheir own definite proposals, of which one, namely,-the self-determination of Armenia(Anatolia) was rejected as an interference with internal Turkish affairs. TheOttoman delegates now began to unmask themselves, and stated that a definite officialrecognition of the Trans-Caucasian Republic could only be given by means of a specialclause in the treaty, negotiations about which could only be held after all claim toBatum, Ardaban, and Kars had been relinquished.This announcement caused a suspension of the conference, and some members of theTrans-Caucasian delegation returned to Tiflis to report to the Diet, after which thepresident of the delegation was invested with full powers, the Diet having decided onthe 13th March to abide by its decision regarding the question of peace terms withTurkey, but to attempt to make an honourable peace acceptable to the Caucasus andTurkey. . In the end, at the resumed conference, the Turkish delegation was informedthat the Trans-Caucasian Government was ready to come to an understanding on theArmenian question acceptable to the Turkish delegation, yet which would allow theTrans-Caucasian delegates in the course of the conference to present the question ofthe return of the Armenians as Turkish subjects for consideration and decision, as alsothe refugees of other nationalities. There followed a further suspension in order that theOttoman delegation might confer with its Government. The reply came in the form of anultimatum, with a request for the definite and final proposals of the Trans-CaucasianGovernment within forty-eight hours.This announcement was immediately sent on to Tiflis, and as the Trans-Caucasiandelegation received no further communication from their Government, they surrenderedtheir position at the expiry of the time allotted, and stated that they accepted theBrest-Litovsk Treaty.Thereafter on the 31st March Eauf Bey communicated to the Trans-Caucasiandelegation that the Turkish Government had been informed of the signing of the Brest-Litovsk Treaty, and considered it necessary, before summoning their allies to furthernegotiations, that the Trans-Caucasian Government should declare its independence.On the 1st April, in view of the impossibility of coming to agreement about furtherTurkish demands, the two delegations agreed to consider the Conference suspended,deprecating, however, the idea of a rupture.Up to the period of the opening of the negotiations the Turkish forces had beenconstantly advancing into Trans-Caucasia. Indeed Erzerum seems to have been takenafter slight opposition on the day on which they opened (27th February), nor did thefact of the actual deliberations hinder the military activities. In certain sections of thecountry the Turks received the direct assistance of the Kurds.The Batum Negotiations.The Trans-Caucasian Government now considered the possibility of continuing thewar, but the Tatar section was opposed to the idea. The Turks continued to advance.Batum was captured (1st April) and Kars threatened, being captured on the 26th April.Opinion now swung towards the other extreme of surrender, and the Turkish invitationto resume negotiations at Batum was readily accepted. On this occasion Germany wasalso represented, in particular by General von Lossow. The negotiations commencedabout the 20th May. The Turkish Government now reiterated their advances onthe Brest-Litovsk terms, and demanded in addition the districts of Akhalsikh andAkhalkalaki in the Government of Tiflis and control of the Ti ans-Caucasian and Julfarailways for the transport of troops during the war. The Georgian delegates refusedto surrender the districts in question, and the negotiations were broken off on the25th May.The Trans-Caucasian Government ceased to exist after the collapse of the Batumnegotiations.   De facto it had lost its representative character from the date of the fall
4of Kars, when the Tatar elements broke away; The Georgians and Armenians had up-till now been maintaining a sporadic defence at various points, but with the continuedadvance of the Turks a German orientation of the Georgians came into evidence.On their advice the independence of the now reduced Georgia was proclaimed by theGeorgian National Government on the 2(5th May. This was followed by the proclamationof an independent Armenian Republic of Ararat under the protection of Turkey,consisting merely of the districts of Erivan and Etchmiadzin, embracing some 12,000square kilometres in all. A third republic also proclaimed and placed under Turkishprotection was that of Azerbaijan, comprising the Governments of Baku and Elizabetpoland the remaining five districts of Erivan ; it was also made to include the Georgiandistricts of Zakhatal and Borchalo.. It is perfectly clear that while Turkey wished tomaintain a Trans-Caucasian republic, with the Tatars predominant in it, under herprotection, Germany was opposed to this plan, as she considered that unless the countrywas divided in an orderly manner on historical and ethnographical lines between thethree nationalities it would not present so suitable a subject for exploitation.Almost immediately thereafter an ultimatum was addressed by Turkey to thedelegates at Batum, who replied that a Trans-Caucasian Government no longer existed..Separate delegations nominated by Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan arrived at Batumon the 4th June and signed a series of treaties accepting the Turkish ultimatum. Fromthe districts of Akhalkalaki and Akhalzikh Turkey could always threaten Tiflis andKutais, while her domination of Eastern Trans-Cancasia was even more complete.Meanwhile, on account of the clo-^e relations always existing between Georgiaand the Ukraine, Tchkhenkeli, the ex-Premier of the Trans-Caucasian Government,went to Kiev, to consult the Rada as to the best steps to take in view of theTurkish aggression. Influenced by what he saw at Kiev, realising the hopelessnessof resisting the German or Turkish military power under the circumstances, and withno expectation of Allied assistance, he proceeded to Berlin and sought the interventionand assistance of Germany in the Georgian interests against the Turkish demands. Thesequel was a passage in Von Kuhlmann&apos;s speech of the 24th June: &quot; Turkey, which in the Brest-Litovsk Treaty of Peace had received the-promise of getting back those districts which she had lost in 1877 to the Russians,found herself obliged quite recently, by the strategic development in UpperMesopotamia, to utilise the line Batum-Tabriz-Julfa in order to lay a line ofcommunications across Northern Azerbaijan to the Tigris Valley. In its advancefrom the territories falling to it under the Brest-Litovsk Treaty the Turkish army,as we were informed by the supreme Turkish Army Command, for reasons of safety,pushed the left wing of its advancing troops fairly wide into regions whichundoubtedly, according to the Brest-Litovsk Treaty, could not come into questionfor permanent occupation or annexation by Turkey. Both Chief Army Commandshave had a thorough discussion on the matter. The Turkish advance to the Caucasushas been, we have been informed, stopped.&quot;*On the 28th June! 3,000 German troops landed at Poti and proceeded to Tiflis, notso much to act as an army of occupation as to watch the. Turks. It is of interest alsoin this connection to note that while Germany appointed Count Schulenburg asenvoy to the Georgian Government, no corresponding appointment was made in thecase of the Armenian or Tatar Republics. The same tendency to preferential dealingappears in the Russo-German supplementary treaty, where it is provided that &quot; Russia agrees to Germany&apos;s recognising Georgia as an independent State.Germany will give no assistance to any third Power in any military operations inthe Caucasus outside Georgia or in the districts mentioned in Article 4, paragraph 3,of the Peace Treaty.&quot;!The Constantinople Conference.The intention apparently was to hold a conference at Constantinople for theratification of the Batum Treaty. Delegates duly arrived and accounts have been givenof certain negotiations there (Turkey, No. 006). There is, however, to date no account iathe &quot; Daily Review &quot; Enemy Press Supplement of political negotiations at Constantinople&apos;* &quot; Daily Keview,&quot; Enemy Pvens Supplement, July 4, 1918.t &quot;Daily Review,&quot; Enemy Press Supplemeut, September 19, 1918.
59gQl.) \j uas a result of which the terms of the Batum Treaty were ratified,* while M. AvalofT,accredited Georgian delegate to Berlin, distinctly states in a despatch of the 25thSeptember, handed to Sir H. Findlay, that: &quot; La conference nest pas lieu jusqu&apos;a cettedate (le 14 septembre).....&quot;   This, however, is just what might have been expectedon the part of Germany, as the terms were much too favourable to her Caucasian rival,Turkey. That there was German purpose in the restricted scope and subsequentprevention of decision in the political negotiations at Constantinople seems to befurther evidenced by the terms of the (Brest-Litovsk) supplementary treaties betweenGermany and Russia.Nevertheless, the Turks continued their advance in Trans-Caucasia and North-&quot;West Persia. This was facilitated by the arrangements made at Batum (and probablyratified at Constantinople) with regard to the use of the railways, although every stepin the Turkish progress, which reached Julfa, Hamadan, and Enzeli was distasteful tothe Germans. In particular the Tatar population was particularly mobilised with aview to the capture of Baku. This city had been in the early part of April the sceneof the only considerable Bolshevik success in Trans-Caucasia, the Tatars proving thestrongest anti-Bolshevik element in the place. Unfortunately some of the localArmenians could not resist the temptation to make common cause with the Bolsheviks,and seized the opportunity to pay off old scores on the Tatars. Later ,by a smallmajority, the Russian and Armenian non-Bolshevik elements invited the Britishco-operation on the 25th July. In spite of the brilliant British interlude Bakufell into the hands of the Turks on the 30th August.Georgia.Georgia, historically and ethnographically, consists of the following areas: TheGovernment of Tiflis, the district of Zakhatal, the Government of Kutais, the districtsof Ardahan and Olti in the province of Kars, the provinces of Batum and Lazistan, theprovince of Sukhum, and the southern part of the Black Sea province. Thus theeastern boundary of Georgia is the district of Zakhatal, then a portion of the Govern -ment of Elisabetpol, beginning from the station of Evlakh, and thereafter following astraight line down to the north of Alexandropol. The Georgian boundary to the north-west on the Black Sea extends almost as far as Tuapse, which is the old boundary ofthe Georgian province of Abkhazia. It has been stated that the Tatars claim thewhole of the district of Zakhatal, as also the Borchalo district in the Government ofTiflis. Ardahan, Olti, and the provinces of Batum and Lazistan are principallyinhabited by Mohammedan Georgians.The Georgian race is the most compact ethnographical element in the - Caucasus,numbering in all about 3,000,000, of whom 2,350,000 are Christians; the remainder,including the Lazis, are Mohammedans.Under the Treaty of Batum between Turkey and Georgia, Turkey detachedfrom Georgia the following districts: In the province of Tiflis the districts ofAkhalsikh and Akhalkalaki, together with the province of Batum, and districts ofArdahan and Olti in the province of Kars, which constitute organic parts of Georgia.In any reconstruction of Trans-Caucasia, they ought to be returned to Georgia forhistorical and economic reasons. Further, those Georgian Mohammedans, who arebrave and intelligent, would furnish Turkey with a substantial fighting force in theevent of their being affiliated to Turkey, and such a dismemberment of Georgia andseparation of Mohammedan Georgians from Christian Georgians, would mean theformation of a Georgian Irredenta. In any case, the mere fact that these Georgians areMohammedans furnishes no reason for a Turkish claim over a race that is not Turkish,any more than it does for Turkish dominion over Arabs, Syrians, MohammedanAlbanians, or the Mohammedan Serbians of Bosnia.The Georgian claim for independence is based in the first instance on the circum-stances that that people has had a historical continuity of some 2,000 years, and wasable to maintain its political independence till 1801 under a series of most tryingcircumstances and invasions. Further, the Georgians not merely have the right to self-determination proclaimed by the Allies, but also have their treaty rights of 1783 withRussia, which were violated by that country.   Accordingly de jure Georgia has full* In &quot; La Voix de 1&apos;Armenie &quot; (1st and 15th July), there is reproduced,&quot; sous toutes reserves,&quot; an accountof a statement made to a correspondent of the &quot; Politische Korrespondenz &quot; of Vienna by M. Khatessian, inwhich he speaks of a treaty of peace in fourteen articles having been signed on the 4th July by each of thethree KepublicB with Hahl Bey. In default of other evidence, it seems as if this were a reference to theTreaty of Batum of the 4th June.[367-48J C
right to determine her position. In this respect she has a stronger position than any-other nationality in the former Russian Empire, for she was never conquered by Russia.It is also important to note that the geographical position of Georgia does not bar theway to the sea for Russia like the Ukraine or the Baltic provinces. Georgia in Russianhands was indeed only a bridge for the domination of Persia and Asia Minor. Russiacannot justify her presence in Georgia except from an imperialistic point of view; shecannot strictly say, &quot; I need Georgia.&quot; Georgia, finally, is surrounded on the east bythe Tatars and Lesghians, semi-barbaric races that have been an occasion of trouble inthe past as in the present. On the north she borders with the Kuban Cossacks, whohave lived largely to oppress, and on her southern borders she has been contiguous withTurkey, with whom she has nothing &quot;in common. Such are the circumstances thatconstitute the argument in the Georgian mind for the necessity of her independence.In any case there can be no true understanding of the Trans-Caucasian situationuntil it is realised that the Georgians rather than the Armenians are to-day thedominating race in that region. Previous to the war, they had rapidly been improvingtheir economical position relative to the Armenians, while they proved their fitnessfor self-government by their utilisation of the possibilities opened up for the firsttime by the revolution of March 1917. In ecclesiastical, military, legal, and educationalmatters they showed alertness and efficiency in the introduction of measures and theorganisation of institutions tending to the establishment and betterment of thesedifferent as fleets of their national life. There is little doubt that nothing in thisparticular national development escaped the notice of Germany, and that for manyreasons Georgia had become a subject of peculiar interest to Germany.It is worthy of remark that on the 24th June, von Kuhlmann spoke in the Reichstagas follows: &quot; The disappearance of the Tsar&apos;s Government gives rise to a whole series ofquestions in the Caucasus. The State of Georgia, which was by far the mostconsolidated as a nation, aimed from the beginning, after the disappearance ofRussian supremacy at building up anew and independently carrying on its nationallife. Georgia Was followed by other comparatively new and insecurely establishedpolitical entities. Armenia tried to obtain independence as a State. The Tatarsalso, who form /the predominating element of the population in the EasternCaucasus region as far as the neighbourhood of Baku, combined into the State ofTartary. These three States are trying, on the other hand, to unite in theform of a Trans-Caucasian republic, and thereby to increase their internal strengthas a Stats, and their power of resistance towards the outer world.&quot; [Here followsthe passage quoted on p. 4.] &quot; The conditions of the future settlement of Caucasianaffairs will be settled at the conference in Constantinople. The State of Georgia,with which we have entered into friendly relations, and which we have recognisedby a diplomatic exchange of notes as de facto existing, has sent us to Berlin itsForeign Minister, with whom we are engaged in a friendly exchange of views. We,for our part, in order to attain a satisfactory insight into the situation of Georgiaitself, and the very confused situation in the Caucasus, have sent General vonKress on a diplomatic mission to Tiflis. We wish a prosperous future to theGeorgian State and its brave population and rich land--(loud cheers) and weshall gladly do what in us lies to build up friendly relations between Georgia andGermany.&quot;It is perhaps worth while attempting to find out what lay behind these verymarked references by von Kuhlmann to the State of Georgia. From the beginningof the armed organised opposition on the part of the Georgians and the Armenians tothe Turks, the latter had been reckoning on the ultimate exhaustion of the supplies ofthe Georgian and Armenian armies, after which it would be a very easy matter tocontrol the whole of Trans-Caucasia.The German idea was, however, to use Turkish pressure on Georgia in the sameway in which she used the Bolsheviks against the Ukraine, creating a situation inwhich sheeould appear the only protector of Georgia against the Turks. It seems as ifthe intention of Germany was to make Georgia her deputy-governor in the Caucasusand Middle-East, just as she attempted to make Finland her deputy-governor in relationto North ^ Russia, and Bulgaria to the Balkans. These three peoples, while totallydifferent in many characteristics, yet all possess good fighting qualities, and haveaccordingly been selected by Germany.The reason of this attitude on the part of Germany to Georgia is not far to seek.
7Armenia, partly on account of the historical massacres, partly owing to the fact thather cause has always had outstanding Armenian personalities like Boghos NubarPasha to champion it, lias been the subject of West European solicitude for manyyears. The Georgians, their close neighbours have not attracted the attention of thoWest in the same way, and it might naturally be supposed that Germany wouldendeavour to work on any feelings of jealousy, and offer to espouse the Georgian causeon certain terms. This has actually been the case. On more than one occasion,during the latter period of the war, overtures have been made to the Georgians bythe Germans, and rejected. The reason for such overtures, apart from the desire tohave control over the wealth of the country, has undoubtedly been the circumstancethat the Georgians are a fighting race. Organised and properly supported, they couldput 250,000 men in the field. The desire to utili.-e this force, either now or in thefuture, in connection with her schemes in the Middle and Far East, has been thegoverning idea in German diplomacy in Trans-Caucasia. The same instinct thatrealised the existence of pliable first-rate fighting stuff in the Bulgarian and Finn hadlikewise hoped for the Georgian. Just as the 300,000 Bulgarian bayonets underGerman influence upset the balance of the forces in the Balkans to the disadvantageof the Allies, so it was hoped that through a similar hold upon the military resourcesof Georgia, the balance of forces would be upset in the Middle East in favour ofGermany, and the military situation of all the Powers interested in this area be thusimperilled. The military importance of a people very often does not depend on theactual number of its army so much as on the presence of that army in the fightingfield at a certain place and at a certain time. Already reports are to hand aboutsecret agreements between Germany and Georgia as, e.g., in connection with manganesedeposits and the export of various raw materials, but in view of the past history ofGeorgia these negotiations may still be considered as opportunism in face of completeignorance of the outside situation and of the presence of force majeure. The situationhas features analogous to those in Finland, only the Turks play the part of the PiedGuards, but there is nothing to show that Georgia has committed herself to Germanyin anything like the same degree that the &quot;Finnish Government committed their countryto Germany. The probability is that &quot;the urgent message&quot; brought by GabrielKbundadze, Diplomatic Representative of Georgia in Bolshevik Russia, from the TiflisGovernment to Mr. Wardrop, on the 2nd August, was genuine. It was to the effectthat  ; no party in Georgia was pro-German, but that, on the contrary, all hiscountrymen looked first of all to Great Britain and then to France as their truefriends, and if they had been forced to appear to assume a German orientation thiswas entirely due to the desperate plight in which they found themselves betweenthe Turks and their wild Moslem supporters on the one hand, and the equally ferociousBolshevik, of Baku and the Northern Caucasus on the other. The Bolsheviks hadthoroughly demoralised the Caucasian front, and this was why Batum, Erzerum, $c,had fallen.&quot; On the 9th September Mr. Zourab Avaloff (member for Georgia inthe Russian Senate under the Kerensky Government) stated to Sir M. Findlaythat &quot; he and others had been to Berlin to ask for recognition of national independence,and that his Government (in Georgia) especially desired recognition by Great Britainand France.&quot; This gives an opening for entering into direct communication whichmight be used very advantageously in the interests of the Allies. The field must notbs left to Germany. Confirmation of this reading of the situation is found also in arecent statement by Captain Noel to the effect that &quot; the Georgians realised that theyhad chosen the wrong side and wished to repair their errors.&quot; He urged entering intorelations with them and promising them and the mountain tribes of the Caucasus &quot; touse our friendly offices at the Peace Conference to procure a measuie of self-governmentwhich will give them scope to develop their national and religious ideals.&apos;&apos; The sameconclusion occurs in the following telegram from Mr. Leslie Urquhart : &quot;The Georgiansand Mingreliaus have been forced to conclude peace in view of break away (? by)Armenians. Tatars were practically neutral. Georgians and Mingrelians come roundto our side on first opportunity.&quot;Armenia.In the solution of the Armenian question, it would seem to be advisable to considerthe future centre of Armenia gravitating towards Southern Asia Minor, rather thantowards the Caucasus, whither the Armenians have come in past decades mainly asrefugees from Turkey during the Russian rule, and been used in part (as, indeed, werethe other nationalities likewise by the Russian Government) to promote discord betweenthe Georgians and Tatars. From the point of view of a future satisfactory arrangement[367-48] D
with Georgia, it is a matter of great importance that no part of the Southern portions ofhistorical Georgian provinces should be .included in an Armenian State, since theseregions are principally populated by Georgian Mohammedans. For, in that event, twodifficulties will at once arise, namely, hostile feeling on the part of Georgia towardsArmenia, and the practical impossibility of the latter effectively controlling a territory70 per cent, of whose population is Georgian Mohammedan, and therefore of differentrace. All such occasions for conflict between Georgia and Armenia can only be highlydetrimental to both races, and will provide the Turks and Germans with the necessarymatedal for intrigues.Again, the Armenian Socialist politicians have been agitating for the strengtheningof the Socialist elements in Georgia with a view to weakening the national feelingamongst the Georgians, and in this way to strengthen internationalism, the idea ofwhich is also repugnant to the majority of the Tatar leaders. They have also beensteadily working in the direction of attempting to make Tiflis, the ancient Georgiancapiial, into a sort of general capital for Trans-Caucasia, an attitude not dissimilar tothat of the Jews in Warsaw. Latterly the Armenians, deprived of their territory inTurkey, have emigrate 1 into Tiflis and Georgia proper, the number of refugees in theneighbourhood of Tiflis alone running into hundreds of thousands. As Tiflis is cutoff from the Kuban corn supplies, and is unable to feed such a great addition to thepopulation, the conditions from the point of view of health and food are serious. Itwould mean the obviation of a great deal of future trouble if a clear understanding couldbe reached upon this matter.Further, from the point of view of the future harmonious relations with Georgia,and in accordance with historical and ethnographical considerations, it is suggestedin Georgian circles that the Northern boundaries of the Armenian State should runin a straight line from Erzinjan to Erzerum, thence to Sarakamysh, thence to Kars,thence to Alexandropol, thence to ttrivan, and. from that point the whole frontier ofTurkey and Persia should be followed down to Van. Such an arrangement implies theinclusion of the whole of the province of Kars, with the exception of the districts ofArdahan and Olti, and the whole of Erivan up to Lake Goktcha. With the Turkishprovinces (Van, Bitlis, Sivas, Erzerum, Karput, and Kilikia), the Armenians would have.a territory largely disproportionate to their numbers, of which to share in theadministration.On the other hand, if under any arrangement Turkey is permitted to retainsuzerainty over an autonomous Armenia, the probabilities are that she will tend to pushthe Armenians on to the Southern portions of Georgian territory seized under the Brest-Litovsk and Supplementary Treaties, and not allow this autonomous (or independent)Armenia to extend further west than Erzerum, thus maintaining physical contact withPersia and the Azerbaijan Tatars, and at the same time creating lasting animositybetween Armenians and Georgians.The Tatars.With Georgia and Armenia constituted as two independent States for amicablearrangements for their relationship as good neighbours will follow on the defeat of-*Turkey there remains the question of the Tatars. The establishment of theindependent States of Georgia and Armenia is necessary in order to interpose a solidbarrier, which will break down the contact between Turkey and Persia and theAzerbaijan territories. The leading necessity for separating the Tatars and Turks inthis way lies in the circumstance that if the Tatars of Eastern Caucasia and Azerbaijanare directly linked up with Turkey, this means that the latter will be in a position tobring under her direct influence the whole of Northern Persia, Afghanistan, andTurkestan. A possible solution therefore appears to be the further creation of anindependent Azerbaijan State. These three independent States could be easilycontrolled as the result of the internationalisation of the Dardanelles and Constantinople.After a period of time, when these three States have consolidated and recovered fromthe appalling hardships of the war, it probably would not be very difficult to arrange aFedei ation amongst them, thus forming a Trans-Caucasian Republic with threecontributory States. The essential point is, however, that such a Federation mustnot be attempted before this consolidation takes place, as it would necessarily lead toracial feuds and perpetual disturbances. The principle of Federation can only come asthe natural consequence of a long political and cultural evolution ; but that it can socome is evidenced in the case of the Balkans and Scandinavia. The great drawback toan Azerbaijan Republic is the illiteracy and total lack of political capacity of the Tatars.The alternative solution, viz., to leave Trans-Caucasian Azerbaijan under Russia seems
9preferable. Such a solution was naturally the German one, as appears from indicationsin the German-Russian Supplementary Treaty. &quot; Russia will do her utmost to further theproduction of crude oil and crude-oil.products in the Baku district, and will supply toGermany a quarter of the amount produced, or at least a number of tons, to be agreed uponlater, per month. In so far as the quantities produced in the Baku district are not sufficientto supply this number of tons,, or must be used for other purposes, they will be supple-mented by quantities produced elsewhere. . . . Germany will also take measures toprevent the military forces of any third Power in the Caucasus overstepping thefollowing lines: The Kura, from its mouth to Petropavlovskoye; from there onwards,the boundaries of the district Shemakha to Agrioba; thence a straight line to thepoint where the boundaries of the districts of Baku, Shemakha, and Kuba meet; thenalong the northern boundary of the district of Baku to the sea.&quot;* If this procedurewere followed, Daghestan might be added to this Federated State of Russia, On theother hand, the most recent Turkish ambition is to add the Persian Azerbaijan andmake the whole a Tatar State.Relations of Trans-Caucasia to Russia.It becomes increasingly clear that the question of the Russian Border States isgoing to be one of the cruces of the Peace Conference. It naturally arises out of theprinciple, of self-determination, to which the Entente Powers are to a great degreecommitted. The practical difficulty will be in deciding which particular countries andpeoples are fit subjects for the application of it. It cannot be applied to the Hereros,but it may be applied to the Esthonians; and in the measure in which it is urged bythe Entente Powers, will the reflex effect be felt in connection with countries likeIreland, Egypt, and India.It is further obvious that the degree in which the principle of self-determination isurged in the case of the Russian Border States may influence the future relations ofRussia and Great Britain, and tend to drive Russia and Germany together. There isno doubt that the centralising instinct is very strong in the Russian character. Itmay take different forms in a Gourko and a Kerensky, the one following it for military-purposes, the other for political control; but it is there alike in both cases, and has tobe reckoned with. The educated Russian would not easily school himself to the loss ofFinland, the Baltic Provinces, and Trans-Caucasia. Already in many cases he isinclined to suggest that the movements for independence and self-determination inthese countries are artificial and the products of British stimulation with a view toweakening. Russia. This is of course mere wilful disregard of the facts of the case,and the practical solution can only lie along the lines of deciding, after the mostcareful consideration, in what cases the claims for economic and political independenceare the soundest, leaving open, however, in every instance the possibility of the futurereturn of these States into a Russian Federation.With regard to Trans-Caucasia, the situation seems to be as follows : The Georgiansat any rate are quite unwilling to consider entry into a Russian Federation at thepresent time ; for one reason, such a step will bring them into immediate connectionwith Northern Caucasia, which is dominated by Cossacks whose brutal actions inconnection with the subjugation and recent political movements in the Caucasus arenot easily forgotten, and make the idea of friendly relations difficult to entertain. Therecord of Liakoff, the present Ataman of the Kuban Cossacks, in connection, with histreatment of the native populations in Persia and on the Caucasian front is in itselfsufficient to destroy for a long time all thoughts of a rapprochement. There is thefurther point that the Cossacks are not likely to agree to a republican form ofGovernment, since their institutions are based on a feudal militaristic system. TheArmenians will be content to be under international control. The Tatars can hardlyas yet stand alone.For all these reasons independence or semi-independence seems to be the initialstep in a possible process of later Federation which could only be realised to-day in aformula ; in actuality, only after the process of decades. These constitute at the sametime some of the reasons wrhy through recent years the gravitation of Georgia andArmenia has always been towards the Western democracies. Nevertheless, theCaucasian questions are so complicated, and the upheaval and destruction so great asto render even the most recent statistics untrustworthy, and to suggest that probablythe wisest decisions will only be reached after an investigation of the actual conditionson the spot by an Allied Commission.o* &quot; Daily Review&quot; (E.P.S.), September 19, 1918.
