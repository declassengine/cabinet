It was agreed to reduce the price of margarine at the earliestpracticable date and that the reduction should be announced at the same time as theincrease in the price of home-produced butter.A memorandum on the terms of reference and constitution of the proposed SoapSupplies Board was considered and generally approved. It was agreed that theexercise of executive functions by this Board should be subject to the direction of theFood Controller. Mr. dynes undertook to consult Mr. 0&apos;Grady as to the number ofrepresentatives. of workers on the Board. It was decided that the scheme whensettled should be officially submitted to the Board of Trade.Memoranda on the measures to be taken for decreasing the present flow of fatstock to the markets and increasing the supply from February to July 1919 werediscussed.It was agreed that the Imports Board should ascertain the earliest date on whichthe financial situation could be relieved after the cessation of hostilities by increasingimports from Australasia and the Argentine, and also investigate the question of poolingthe cost of imported meat as between British military and civilian needs, as well asbetween the Allies.The decision of the Treasury that temporary unpaid officers might becomecandidates for Parliament was considered. It was agreed that a note putting the caseas regards temporary paid officers of the Department should be sent to the Chancellorof the Exchequer. .:A memorandum on the Potato Distribution Scheme by Mr. Beveridge wasconsidered. It was agreed that in view of the announcement by the Food Controllermade on August 8th the price must be fixed at Id. per lb. for lower grade and \\d. forfirst grade potatoes. It was decided that these prices should operate during Novemberand December, but that it should be announced that the price will be raised to l\d.and l\d. on January 1st. The prices to be paid to Scottish and Irish farmers werealso provisionally agreed.A memorandum by Major Astor on the subject of food control after the war wasbrought before the Council. It was agreed that a Cabinet memorandum on the subjectshould be prepared.The Imports Board. It was reported that there were 15,000 to 20,000 tons ofbutter available in cold storage at Vladivostock that could be purchased at a reasonableprice if freight were procurable. It was agreed that a report should be made on the,tonnago position and that a cable should be sent to the Union Cold Storage Companyat Vladivostock as to the possibility of securing freight.It was agreed that 1,200 tons of tea from China should be imported.It was decided that 3,611 tons of Chinese bacon should be offered to the FrenchGovernment for revictualling Lille and other reconquered territory.It was agreed that the Ministry of Food had no objection to the export of oliveoil from Spain to the Colonies. Application for such purchases must be made throughthe Ministry of Food.The Home Supplies Board. In accordance with the instructions of the FoodCouncil, which had approved the principle, a scale of increasing prices to be offeredfor fat stock during the coming months in order to regulate the flow of beasts andsheep to the markets was settled, subject to the necessary consents.Proposals from the Consumers&apos; Council for a price of bd. and from the Board ofAgriculture of Qd. per fresh egg, were considered.Joint Finance Board The possibility of limiting the profit secured by bakerswas discussed.   It was agreed that it was clear that there were large, variations inA   (33)6638-1   Vk 1   140  10/18   E &amp; S &apos; \
profits, aud that under a flat rate these variations were bound to continue, but itwould be impossible for the Ministry to investigate the accounts of, or enter intocontracts with everv baker.i The economies to be derived from amalgamation and closing down of the lesseconomical bakeries were discussed, together with a scheme for forming local associa-tions or zones. As a first step it was decided that the voluntary experiments on theselines at present being made by bakers at Bexhill should be supported and that furthersimilar experiments in . suitable districts should be encouraged. Mr. Paul wasinstructed to prepare, and submit to the Food Council, concrete proposals to giveeffect to a scheme outlined by him in a memorandum on the bread subsidy ; theseconcrete proposals should include the immediate establishment of a small inter-departmental Committee, uniting powers inherent in the Coal Controller, the RoadTransport Board, the Ministry of National Service, the Local Government Board, andthe Ministry of Food, and should state the powers enjoyed by each of these authorities,which the Committee would require.Mr. Peat reported that on the best estimates available there would be a loss atthe 31st March, 1919, of approximately 1,400,000L on the Meat Fund. This would beincreased to about 1,600,0007. if the proposed further increases to the farmers weredecided upon, but he estimated that after taking into account such proposed increases tothe farmers the account would practically balance by March .192U. It was agreedthat the British delegates on the Meat Executive should endeavour to secure that thecivilian needs of Great Britain for imported meat should be provided for at a fairaverage price, and not at a higher price than meat supplied to the Army or to theAllies.Generally it was decided that the financial officers should make quarterly reportsto the Joint Finance Board, showing the current and prospective profit and loss ofvarious activities under their control in order to keep the Food Controller fullyinformed as to the situation.The effect of an armistice or peace on prices was discussed, and it was decidedthat (a) the Wheat Commission should prepare a statement as to the cereal situationand what wheat supplies and crops would be available in neutral and enemy countriesand how these would affect prices; (b) the Sugar Commission should prepare asimilar statement about sugar; and (c) Mr. Peat should prepare a similar statementfor other activities of the Ministry of Food.The Consumers&apos; Council. Two meetings of the Council have been held duringthe week.Mr. Wise made a report to the Council on the subject of the shortage of feeding-stuffs and the steps taken to meet the situation arising thereon.The Council also considered the scheme for the distribution of cheese.Bacon. The position of the English curerB of home-grown bacon is veryunsatisfactory, and is likely to become more so if the available stock of English pigsis diverted almost entirely to the pork butcher. This difficulty must be accentuatedby the fact that at present it pays the Irish farmers better to sell their pigs tothecurersin Ireland, rather than ship them to England at current prices.Feeding-stuffs. Applications from farmers and others entitled to obtain feeding-stuffs under the new Distribution Scheme which is to be put into operation on17th November next are being received slowly by the Area Live Stock Commissionerswhose staffs are keeping pace with the work entailed in scrutinising the applicationsand preparing the necessary certificates. About 150,000 application forms havealready been received. The last day for receiving applications has now been reached,but a Press notice has been issued informing the public that late applications willreceive attention in rotation, and it is hoped that any person applying before1st November will be able to participate in the distribution from the outset. Personsapplying after that date will be provided with supplies as quickly as possible inrotation after provision has been made for earlier applicants.Arrangements for securing the provision of supplies to the. dealers are beingrapidly completed, and although there may be some difficulty at the outset insupplying persons who have failed to apply before 1st November, no difficulty isanticipated in supplying those who have applied in due time with the limitedquantities that are available for distribution. *
Meat.-The freezing of meat has been continued during the present week asmentioned in last week&apos;;&apos; Report, and steps have been taken to restrict the number ofIrish cattle imported into this country.In view of the importance of maintaining an even supply of fat cattle and sheepfor consumption, and in order to meet the extra expenses incurred by farmers inholding back stock, it has been decided to increase, in December, by a further Is. perlive hundredweight the price to be paid for cattle for slaughter, making the price ofsuper first-grade cattle 78s. instead of 76s. as at present, and also gradually to increasethe prices already announced for both fat sheep and first-grade cattle, as fromFebruary 1st. The highest point in the new scale will be reached in May, when theprice of first-grade beasts will be 10s. per live hundredweight above to-day&apos;s prices,returning by gradual decreases to to-day&apos;s prices in August and September of nextyear.- These prices are intended to encourage the winter feeder to take immature beastsfrom summer grazing districts and to reduce the numbers of cattle at present beingoffered for slaughter.The following schedule gives the prices in each month for cattle of each grade :  	First Grade.

An Inter-Departmental Consultative Committee has been set up, as theFood Controller considered it essential that the Ministry of4 Food (as the Departmentresponsible for procuring supplies of oilseeds, for British needs, and in respect- of
purchases in British territories for Allied needs, in accordance with the decisions ofthe Oilseed Executive) should, act in close consultation with other Government Depart-ments concerned. One meeting has already been held, the following Departmentsbeing represented : The Ministry of Food, the Ministry of Munitions, the Board ofTrade, the Foreign Office, the Colonial Office, the India Office, the Ministry of Shipping,the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries, the Scottish Board of Agriculture, theDepartment of Agriculture and Technical Instruction for Ireland, and the Departmentof Aircraft Production.Divisional Reports.At the monthly conference of Commissioners held at Grosvenor House on 21stOctober, it was stated in connection with reports of shortage of cheese in certainrural areas, that the amount of cheese recently distributed throughout the countryhas been greater than the amount usually required for consumption at-this period.It was thought that the restrictions on meat consumption probably conduced to thepurchase of cheese by sections of the public from whom in normal times there waslittle or no demand for it.North-East. On the 12th of October the Yorkshire Trades and Labour Councilheld a conference at Leeds, to which 50 local Trades Councils were invited to senddelegates to discuss the re-organisation of Food Committees. The Commissioner forthe Division attended the meeting and explained the recent Food Control CommitteeOrder. The milk question was also dealt with. The Labour Leaders undertook tohelp the Commissioner in every way possible. It was resolved to form a ConsultativeCouncil, consisting of Yorkshire Labour Leaders, who will hold monthly meetings.The reduction in the ration of butcher&apos;s meat, and the advent of colder weather,have contributed to a considerable increase in the sale of bacon and ham.The recent flood in the area bounded by the river Ouse, the river Aire, and theSelby Canal, covered 629 acres. The flood has now subsided, but the potatoes whichhave been under water, are said to be useless for either human or animal food.North Wales. The Commissioner notes the strong feeling in favour of compulsoryrationing evinced by the working classes in his Division.Scotland West. A deputation from .the Federation of Grocers and ProvisionMerchants&apos; Associations was received at the Commissioners&apos; Office at Edinburgh onthe 10th instant, at which Captain Tallents and the three Scottish Commissionerswere present.All questions affecting the retail grocery trade were fully discussed, and it wasagreed by Captain Tallents that the Ministry would give their consideration to variouspoints raised by the deputation. It was also agreed that the Divisional Commissionersfor Scotland would arrange for the appointment of a Retail Grocers&apos; AdvisoryCommittee to meet them periodically, to discuss points of interest arising.On the 12th of October the Commissioner for the Division attended a largemeeting of the Executive Committee of the Lanarkshire Miners&apos; Union of Hamilton.It was a representative gathering from all the mining districts of Lanarkshire, withMr. Robert Smillie, President of the Union, in the chair. The question of foodsupplies was fully discussed, and the meeting is thought to have served a usefulpurpose in explaining many points of interest, some of which presented difficulty tothe Miners&apos; Union, and which should help to allay unrest prevailing in some of themining districts.The sale of red deer in Glasgow market was 104 in the past fortnight, the pricesobtained were good, amounting from Is. to Is. lOd. a lb.Orders under Defence of the Realm Regulations.(1) Order amending the Rationing Order, 1918, dated 15th October 1918, makescertain minor changes in the Rational Order. Under clause 22 of that Order cateringestablishments where no meals are served at a price exceeding 1*. 2d. were exemptedfrom the necessity of keeping a register. Owing to the general increase in prices, thisOrder extends the exemption so as to cover Is. M. eating-places. It also prohibitsmilk from being sold for consumption on the premises or in milk shops.(2) Order amending the Oats (Scotland and Ireland Restriction) Order, 1918,dated 16th October 1918, provides that licences for the export of oats from Scotlandwill be granted in future by the Board of Agriculture for - Scotland, and that oatssuitable for seed and sold for that purpose may be exported from Scotland to otherparts of the United Kingdom free from restrictions,
(3) The Sale of Siveetmeats in Theatres (Restriction) Order, 1918, dated 17thOctober 1918, prohibits the sale of any sweetmeats in any place of public entertainmentafter November 1st, 1918.(4) The Horses (Rationing) Order, 1918, dated 17th October 1918, authorises asfrom October 21, an increased ration of cereal food for the winter months of 2 lb. perday for horses engaged in essential transport work. As previously, horses owned bythe Admiralty, Army Council, and Air Board, and agricultural horses are excludedfrom the Order, and horses used for pleasure purposes are left without any cerealration.(5) The Butter (Ireland) No. 2 Order, 1918, dated 18th October 1918, gives theIrish Food Control Committee power to fix maximum prices for butter sold in Ireland,subject to revision or modification by the Food Controller.(G) Order amending Butter Order, 1918, dated 18th October 1918, increases theprice fixed for British-made butter by 2d. per lb., and puts it on a level withGovernment butter so that the price for all butter is now 2s. Qd. per lb.(7) Order amending Fish (Prices) Order No. 3, 1918, dated 19th October 1918,extends the provisions applicable on a wholesale sale of fresh fish to a wholesale saleof smoked, cured, and frozen fish, the prices for which are laid down. The maximumprices of certain fish such as smoked cod, whiting, and haddock, and pickled mackerelare slightly increased.Enforcement of Orders.The prosecutions recorded in the past week are as follows: Great Britain.       Ireland.Number of prosecutions -        - 601 691,,      -convictions -        -        - 560 617Average fine     -        -        -        -     U. Is. id. 3s. M.The increase in the number of cases over, the previous week is 523, 407 of whichare from Ireland.For the quarter ended the 28th of September (13 weeks), the number ofprosecutions recorded is 10,569, with 9,677 convictions..     The average number per week is 813, with 744 convictions.Two cases of imprisonment without the option of a fine are registered this week,one at Sunderland, and one at Birmingham.The fines inflicted in Scotland are said to be very inadequate in many cases.In the Sheriffs Court of Banff in the past week a butcher who made a falsestatement as to the number of his registered customers, to the extent of about 600,was fined 21. for this grave offence.PART II.-SUMMARY OF THE FOOD POSITION.Imports.Imports of the principal food-stuffs in the week ending 1.9th October (193,000 tons)again showed an improvement on those of the preceding week (190,000 tons) and onthe weekly average since January (181,000 tons). The total of the first seven weeksof the cereal year (1,245,000 tons) now closely approaches last year&apos;s figure,(1,259,000 tons).Imports of tea (9,500 tons) were exceptionally high, the quantity having beenexceeded only once during the past two years. There were good imports of wheatand wheaten flour (105,700 tons as equivalent grain) and of oats (31,300 tons). Beefand mutton imports (8,300 tons) recovered from the low level of the preceding week(2,300 tons). Bacon (5,300 tons) also&apos; recovered somewhat, but not sufficiently tomeet current consumption. In the case of lard also the imports (1,300 tons) werebelow the consumption level. Sugar (22,500 tons) after the extraordinary import inthe preceding week (64,000 tons) fell below the average; while the imports ofcondensed milk (1,900 tons) also failed to reach the high figures of recent weeks.Comparing the total imports of the first seven weeks of the cereal years 1917-18and 1918-19, it will be seen from the following table that the principal increases have-taken place in wheat (a greater proportion of which has arrived in the form of wholegrain), bacon, lard, condensed milk, tea, and cocoa. On the other hand, there havebeen heavy decreases in barley, oats, maize, rice, and sugar.i.   66S8 4 B

A further rise in consumption of bread and flour is indicatedby the bakers&apos; returns for the four weeks ended 12th October. While the increasesince September may be looked upon as a seasonal fluctuation, it is an increase on afigure that was already high. It will be seen from Table C. (2) that the 1918consumption has been above the 1917 consumption in every period of 4 weeks sinceJune, and that the present rate of consumption is 8 per cent, higher than it was ayear ago. It is, in fact, the highest recorded since the series began in April 1917.Among the causes of the excess are, no doubt, the improved palatableness of the loaf,and the rise in the price of other food-stuffs, but a growing sense of security from, thesubmarine menace may, perhaps, have resulted in a less scrupulous economy.Meat.-The numbers of animals accepted for slaughter in Great Britain in theweek ending 12th October are estimated at 43,000 cattle, and 169,000 sheep, ascompared with 47,000 cattle and 208,000 sheep in the preceding week, and 57,000cattle and 260,000 sheep in the corresponding week of 1917. Of the 43,000 cattleaccepted in the week under review about 2,000 were taken by the Army; this falls farshort of the number which it was hoped would be taken. It is estimated that 6,000-8,000 cattle were turned back at the markets. The estimated supply of home-fedbutchers&apos; meat of all kinds for civilian consumption, was 16,100 tons, to which haveto be added 900 tons of refrigerated meat, thus giving a total consumption of 17,000tons as against 18,800 tons in the preceding week and a weekly rate of 25,000 tonsa year ago.Fats. The consumption of butter and margarine (Table B (1)) shows an increaseon recent months. Issues of butter have fallen slightly but those of margarine haveincreased considerably. Issues of lard have been decreased. The reduction inimports has rendered it impossible to allot lard to manufacturers as had been originallyintended, moreover it has been ascertained that retailers, stocks have been accumulating.So far as can be ascertained from returns received consumption in Great Britain isnow approximately equal to the ration quantity, but varies considerably in differentparts of the country. *Sugar. The issue of sugar (Table B (2)) at 17,500 tons includes about 800 tons forbrewing and the manufacture, of syrup which were not covered in the estimates for.earlier periods. Supplies for the manufacture of jam (4,000 tons per week) are fallingas the jam season closes, while the direct consumption of sugar by civilians remainsabout 11,000 tons per week.       . &apos; &apos; ,l &apos;   -. Stocks./ The Ministry&apos;s policy of encouraging the consumption of home-killed meat ismaking itself felt in the stocks of imported, meat which increased by a further2,000 tons in the week ended .12th October. On the other hand, bacon stocks fell2,000 tons, and the Ministry has since released further quantities from storage. Lardstocks were augmented by a further 2,000 tons, and now exceed those recorded forany period during the war except June-August 1917. &apos; Of the total stocks of lard(31,200 tons) the Ministry&apos;s storage accounts for 22,800 tons. Cheese stocks(25,600 tons) remained close to the maximum recorded, while sugar, stocks (382,000 tons),have hot been exceeded since March 1915 (427,000 tons). Stocks of condensed milkremained high (45,800 tons). Stocks of jam in manufacturers&apos; hands amounted to25,700 tons on 1st October.
