TELEGRAM TO LORD DERBY FROM LORD WEIR,-In view of the existing situation, I regard itof urgent importance to give General Trenchard authorityto proceed with the preparation of his operations, and,having regard to the opinions expressed by the Americanand Italian representatives at the second meeting of theInter-Allied Aviation Committee at Versailles on   the31st May, which are in complete accord with the agreementnow made between the French and British Governments, itdocs not appear necessary to delay Trenchard&quot;s appointmentby awaiting formal ratification by the American and ItalianGovernments.      This can follow. General Trenchard hastherefore been officially informed of the agreement betweenthe two Governments and of his&apos;appointment to be Commander-in-Chief of the Inter-Allied Independent Air Force under thesupreme control of Marshal Foch.      Please inform M. Clemeneeauand suggest that, in view of the urgency of the situation,similar instructions should be issued to Marshal Foch*25.10.18.
SECRET* VNOTE FOR M.CLEIOTCEATJ.Eight months ago, the Air Authorities of Great&quot;Britain decided that, adequate provision having, been.madefor the future needs of the Navy and Army, ?it would bepossible to devote a portion of the aerial resourcesavailable for the purpose of undertaking a persistentand systematic offensive by air against Germany.The objective of such an offensive is two-fold;firstly, material, - the destruction of the elements ofproduction and transport, which will have a direct resulton tho Naval and Military effort of the- enemy,&apos;   secondly,moral - the undermining of civilian morale which may notmerely dislocate the industrial effort of the enemy, butmay tend to destroy the war spirit amongst their populationThe British Government, while not for a momentsuggesting that such an offensive oan of itself be decisiveyet is convinced that its effects, if carried outsystematically,and persistently from this date onwardswith gradually increasing weight, offer such considerableadvantages to the Allied cause that they cannot beneglected.     The feeling, moreover, of the British peopleon the subject is such that deep resentment would bearoused against any Government which did not take everystep to further this polcy.The results already achieved by General Trenchard&apos;sForce, weak though at present it is&apos; in numbers and materialgo far to support the British Government1s view as tothe future effects of the campaign.It may doubtless appear that the British areillogical on objecting to an air force operating, as theIndependent Force has up to now done, from French soiland from&apos;the zone of the French military command.beingplaced under the command of the Generalissimo.     . .The British position would be illogical &quot;if thefunctions of the Air Force, were exhausted by the work whichit performs as an auxiliary to the Armies in the FieldsTho British view, however, as is shown by the creation ofthe Air Ministry, is that if the fullest advantage is tobe taken of the possibilities which aerial warfare presentsthe functions of tho Air Force must be treated as three-fold in character, - firstly, auxiliary to the work of theNavy and subordinate to the Naval Authorities;   secondly,auxiliary to the Armies in the Field and subordinate tothe Army Commander;   thirdly, long range bombing operationsindependent of both Army and Navy.They are convinced that in a comparatively shorttime it will seem no more absurd and illogical to treatthe Air Force as a separate entity than it does now withregard to the Navy.,In support of this view, it should be remarkedthat long range bombing is in&apos;its incipient stages.   Evennow it requires for its suocessful handling speciallydesigned material and equipment, and specially chosen andtrained pilots and personnel.     The provision of men,material and accommodation requires months of preparationand thought, and the strategy and tactics of an air,-offensive, if it is to be successful, needs as muchpreparation and as sustained an effort as a military campaig
Success will not be achieved, therefore, if itJ^thought possible to treat tho Long Range Bombing Forceas dependent on the immediate military operations so thpit may be split up and used for military requirements,except under conditions of such critical emergency asdemand, every ounce of weight to be thrown on a particullspot.     The Long Range Bombing Force will lend thehighest degree of help possible to the military situatiby performing the functions for which it is designed inthe manner laid down by its responsible Commander, andwill always be ready to co-operate with the Army Commanias General Trenchard has already done, by performing anfoperations which in his opinion he is able to carry outwithout detracting .from his main campaign.As a concrete instance of the difficulties ofattaching the Long Range Bombing Force to the Forces urnthe control of the General Commanding the Armies on theWestern Front, It is relevant to point out that one ofbases from which General Trenchard1^ Force is designed!operate is in England.Finally, the objectives of the Long Range BombinjjForce are not merely in the narrow sense.military in thlthey are aimed at weakening the enemy&apos;s war effort as af fwhole in ways that are to some extent outside the scopethe command of the. General Commanding on the Western Frjtheir objectives being, in certain instances, naval, bedirected against the enemy&apos;s submarine campaign, and. allpolitioal, being an attack on the morale of the Industr&apos;population with the object of reducing output and ofproducing a tendency towards peace.It is submitted therefore that we are justified&apos;demanding the same measure of autonomy for the IndependForce. :as would be granted to a Naval Force, and that itshould be treated as ready to act in oo-operation with tilArmy, but not as an auxiliary or subordinate to it.The sole object of the British Government both illthe formation of the Independent Force and in their,insistence that nothing should be done to divert the Foilfrom the work assigned to it, is to secure the persistemand systematic bombing of Germany, and to further this Iobject, they will very heartily welcome the co-operatio:their Allies as and when their resources of men andmaterials may permit.They desire, therefore, strongly to advocate theformation of an Inter-Allied Independent Force subjectthe following conditions:-(a) That the object to which the Force shall bedevoted shall be the long range bombing of military,industrial an,d political objectives in enemy countries(as distinct from purely military objectives in the armjlzones), together with such other functions not directlyconnected with Naval or Military operations as futuredevelopments in the uses of aircraft will introduce.(b) The Force shall operate from bases in France!England, or elsewhere,-as may be decided by the Supreme!War Council oh the recommendation of the General Office:Commanding. ,* &apos; &apos;
(c) The Force shall consist of the squadronsallocated thereto from time to time by Great Britain,together with such other squadrons as may be allocated,as resources permit by the Generalissimo.(d) The Force shall be under tho command of Major-General Trenchard who shall be removable only by theSupreme &quot;Jar Council.(e) The British units allocated to General TrenchardJsForce&apos; shall be retained exclusively under his command forthe exeoution of the plan of operations which he hasformed in accordance with the instructions received fromthe Air Ministry;   but units allocated over and above theseby the Generalissimo may be diverted by him for othermilitary purposes, such units, however, if diverted, shallnot operate under General Trenchard&apos;s command in -order thathis sole attention may be concentrated on the objective towhich he has been directed.
Paris 24th September, 19lMCreation of an Inter-Allied Air Force.According to the memorandum on the investigation carriedout by British Air Minister, with a view to forming an AerialArmy for continuous and. systematic offensive action on Germanterritory, the principles of t, e organisation of this AerialForce would appear to be as &quot;follows.(I) The Inter-Allied Air Forve will consist of a certain numberof Flights supplied by Great Britain, reinforced by al] chose whiohlheGeneralissimo can attach to them,(II) It will be placed under the Command of General Trenchard, whocan only be relieved of his command by the Supreme War Council,(III) It will be autonomous and,, though ready to assist theAllied Armies, could not be considered as their auxiliary or attach-ed to them.(IV) It must on no pretext whatever be diverted from its mission,that is, the continuous and systematic Bombing of German Territory,in accordance with the instructions received from the British AirMinistry,As will be seen later, this Programme agrees on mostpoints with that of the French Government,   If it satisfies thewishes of the British people,, it likewise corresponds to thewishes expressed by the population of France, who are subjectedto frequent and severe enemy raids not only in the large townsof the interior, but also in the towns, villages and hamlets&apos;behind, the Front,   The President of the Council is quiteprepared to assist in its formation and has consulted, theGeneralissimo on the subject.   This officer has approved themain lines of the British scheme but considers, modifications oncertain important points to be indispensable.The opinion of Marshal Foch is set forth in the followingsummaryThe first principles set forth, that is to say theformation of the Air Force under General Trenchard&apos;s command,arc accepted without difficulty,     The French command will behappy to place its aviation squadrons and heavy-weight carryingmachines of wide range of action at the orders of this eminentGeneral,These squadrons are to be rapidly prepared for service.In a few months time the production of French factories willenable machines to he put at the disposal of this general, thepower and number of which will be equivalent to those of theBritish aeroplanes under his command.The indispensable unity of conception and command, willthus find its realisation in a close co-operation of the AviationForces,   But, with a view to this same indispensable unity, itseems out of the question to allow this organisation to beoutside the authority of the Generalissimo, or to take its ordersfrom any other authority than his,From   the very first, the creation of an aviationbranch independent of the land or sea forces, and having itsown autonomy would cause, if only from the mere point of view6&apos;f material, great difficulties, if not impossibilities.
If it is, in case of necessity, easy to separate the landforces from the sea forces, the points of contact being ofcourse limited, it is not so when it is a question of anAerial Bombing Force which, outside the hours for flight,would find itself constantly mingled with the armies, livingin the midst of them, supplied by the same transports, operatingin the same zone.Who would portion out the landing grounds between thenew organisation and the military Air Service?   -ho couldorder displacements to the front or rear, according to therequirements of operations?With a dual direction it is Impossible to solve theproblem.   It has always been the rule that, in the sametheatre of operations the Military Command should bo supremeeven with regard to the population, to civil authoritiesno matter what they may be - it would therefore be extraordinarythat a single unit and a military unit at that, should beoutside his influence on questions of primordial importance.Besides this autonomy would be in opposition totactical and even strategical necessities.   The actualbattle front extends for nearly 700 km.   The Air Service must allowthe Generalissimo to increase it enormously in depth.   Whilstits Artillery, its average machines with small range will befound to be inefficient against too distant objectives, suchas junctions of communication routes, factories, industrialareas, it must have in hand that aim which will enable theenemy to be attacked invital quarters or in its moral.How is it possible, however, to separate political or industrialobjectives from those purely military?   Who will undertaketo bomb at a given time objectives such as Aix-la-Chapelle or-Treves stations, or the Rhine Bridges during a long battlewhen it is important to paralyse the traffic at those pointswhere the traffic is bound to pass if the Generalissimo cannotdispose of the serial Bombing Forces?     On the other handit would be useless to use   long range machines to carry outmissions which our squadrons of medium range machines or evenour artillery could fulfil.     There can be, therefore, nowater tight compartments between these various specialisedbranches of the Air Service, and to introduce a new Authorityon the Allied front would cause fresh delays, difficulties andunsuccessful results.   Unity in the command of the Armies,which has so powerfully contributed to the present successesis bound to have the same good Influence on the work of theAir Forces.No doubt the British Memorandum admits that the longdistance bombing forces will assist in the operations beingcarried out when serious events require.   It seems thus thatin order to obtain this necessary union of all resources onlythe menace of a defeat will give it us and make us considerindispensable What we only considered superfluous in the daysof victory *   rre must learn to collect all our means to achievevictory which cannot be obtained by the concentration of thesuperiority of the whole of the forces.Such is in brief the opinion which Marshal  Foch hasexpressed.   As a matter of fact it only differs from theBritish proposals on one essential point:     the subordinationof the Inter-Allied Bombing Corps to the Generalissimo.Besides, the conception of an Inter-Allied Air Forceexclusively at the disposal of the Generalissimo has beencontemplated in the collective Note No. 35 of the 3rd August1918, of the,Supreme Council of War.   The agreement establishedon this point by the Military Representatives of the Supreme
Council fully corroborates with the modification suggestedabove,Based on this collective note No. 35 the Generalissimohas had prepared a scheme of work of which the following is ananalysis,&apos; 1*    Object.To carry war into Germany by attackingher industryher commerceher population2.    Bombing Scheme.Air Raids must be on a large scale and repeated,forming part of a methodical scheme and carried on withtenacity.     The objectives must be at such a distance fromthe lines that thoy can be attacked in a continuous mannerby whole groups and must be capable of being after a time,if not destroyed, at least seriously damaged.3.    Execution of this scheme.The complete realisation of this scheme is not to beundertaken untij, the imperative requirements&apos; of the fightinghave been satisfied or during the intervals of the fighting.It will, therefore be-possible to oarry out thisscheme in two ways according to circumstances.(a) During periods of active operations.The requirements of battle will have to be met first.This reducing in varying proportions^ tho strength of forcesavailable for raids on the interior of Germany.      The bombingaction being begun will, however, have to be pursued evenwith a reduced strength,(b) During steady or quiet periods.Bombing raids on the interior of Germany become thechief work of our bombing service.   Having satisfied the AirService requirements of the Army all available longrange aeroplanes will be free, to take part in the raids.4*    Establishment of Inter-AlliedA&apos;lr Forces.This establishment will include   Allied Flights ofheavy weight carrying aeroplanes with a wide radius of action,and will probably be reinforced later by further availableAllied Flights of the same type, ,The Force will be placed under the command of GeneralTrenchard assisted by ,a   Staff .including besides thepresent staff, an   officer of each of the Nations representedin the Bombing  Force,General Trenchard will be under the immediate commendof Marshal Foch for operations.&quot;* (   ,   Thie*brief analysis shows that the two. programmesonly differ on one or two points.
As stated in the note under discussion ;   the BritishGovernment acknowledges that an offensive action of this kindcannot itself he decisive.   One must therefore seek thodecision where it is to be found, and this decision is only tobe determined by battle.It is absolutely essential that he who conducts thefighting should have the right to dispose of all the AlliedForces, and to eftpUoy them at the right time and in the rightplace.It is, therefore, asked that the above proposalsestablished by Marshal Foch in accordance   with the desireexpressed in the Collective Note No. 55 of the MilitaryRepresentations of the Supreme War council; should receiveas soon as possible the approbation of the British   Government.(Sgd.) Clemenceau.
v A.G.H.Q.14th September 1918.)   Chief Command of the Allied Armies,1st Section,3rd Aviation Bureau,N0.3919/AECTOR/TOUH ON THE SUBJECT 0? ANIND];;PaiI)ENT AIR FORCE.The British point of view is as follows: &quot;Thefunction of tho Air Service must be regarded from three aspeot3,l)   The Air Service aa an Auxiliary to the Navy, andas such subordinated to the Naval Authorities.2)   As an auxiliary to the Armies in the Field, and assuch subordinated to the Military Command.3)   As undertaking long-distanco bombing raids, and inthi3 capacity independent of the Army and Navy.&quot;The logical development of this last point of viewrequires:l)   The organisation of a very powerful Air Force tobomb Germany.2)   The Independence of this Force with respect to thocommand of the Allied Armic3,Quite apart from all teohnical questions relating tcPthe utilisation of the Air Service, the British point of viewcannot be accepted in its entirety.I.    &apos;   ORGANISATION.   .Since tho Military power of the enemy is representedby his army, and 3incc the solo means wc have for destroyinghis army is our own array, it i-3 on our army that we must concentrateall our efforts in order to render it as strong and well-armedas possible.   In consequence any combination tending todiminish the army or hinder it a development on the plea oforganising a new forse capable of reducing the enemy, mu3t berejected.Moreover, the Array in order to beat the enemy seeksto engage him in combat, and in combat it seeks to achievevictory by means of the concentration and numerical superiorityof the forces it brings into action.   This mean3 that anyforce which docs not take part in combat is loat to tho Army,From this onoe more emerges the error of detailingmon capable of fighting to a force which is not organised totake part in combat, as in the course of fighting to destroythe works and moans necossary to the existence of the enemy.Tho Bombing Air Scrvico is not exempt from this ruleand its use in war is measured by the effect which it oanproduoo on tho forces utilised by the enemy in battle. It
con however, in quiet periods, act on the moral of theenemy people or again3t enemy industrial establishments,which is its secondary function.Yet again, no more than the Artillery, the Armouredcars, etc., can the Air Servioo by itself constitute an Array,If it is devoloped to an inordlna^o extent, this must, inview of the necessarily limited resources, inevitably bo tothe detriment of the other arms, and in particular of theinfantry still of paramount iraportanoc, and so reduce thevalue of the whole army,II.    INDEPENDENCE *For the oamo reasons, and tho British memorandumadmits the point, it is inadmissible that tho Air&apos; Forco inquestion should not partioipatc directly in the fightingwhich if it ia to be brought to a victorious conclusiondemands the concentration of all available resource a.The quostion a3 to the be3t use to be made of thisforoo at each moment a3 oiroumstanocs require is thereforeever-present, and the deoision a3 to whether it shall engagein tho fighting or in long-distanco raiding cannot, it seemsbe giyen by any but the Commander in Chief.Moreover the Eaatern Baso of operations is the onlybaso suited at the present time for bombing raids intoGermany owing to its situation with rcspeot to the targetschosen and General Trenchard has provided and organised inthis region the necosaary establishment for the accommodationof the groatcr part, if not the whole of his Forces   Inconsequence should important operations be undertaken East ofVerdun, the presence in this district of numerous squadronsindopondent of the Chief Command, occupying a large part ofthe available ground, and ovororowding the lines of oommuni-cation, will render the accommodation of the units detailedto take part in the fighting almost impossible, particularlyin view of the limited amount of ground suitable for aviationin this region.Moreover the operation of &quot;independent&quot; squadronsmust not be allowed to hinder the work of the fighting unitswhich must inevitably occur if the work of the two AirService a ia not regulated by a single command.Finally, whether as regards- organisation or utilisationit is impossible to oonccivc of the development or even theexistence of4 one of the combatant forces being exempted fromthe authority of the Chief Command, whioh 13 responsible forthe united action of all these forces.FOCH

To the President of the War Council.In your letter No. 11.330,D, of August 13th 1918.you asked me to draw up a general programme for the bombard-ment of the interior of Germany and to examine the conditionsunder which it would be possible to carry it out.The following memorandum deals with these twoquestions.The following conclusions are drawn:-1,     Constitution of an Inter-Allied Bombing Force.(a) To group together under the command of GeneralTrenchard, the British squadrons, French and Italian Capronisquadrons at present assembled in the East and thus to formthe nucleus of an inter-allied force destined to deal withthe interior of Germany,To this nucleus the squadrons of the Trenchardprogramme will later be added as they are formed as also anyavailable squadrons of tho other allied nations possessingheavy weight-oarrying machines with a wide range of action.(b) The forces thus grouped will be at my disposal forthe execution, according to my instructions, of the bombingprogramme accepted by the Supreme War Council.     I reservethe right during operations to use the whole or a part ofthese forces in battle, whether by dividing them among thearmies or by fixing objectives for them in connection withoperations either projected or in course of execution.II*     Scnemo for the utilisation of the inter-allied force.From the programme mentioned in the abovememorandum the following must be excised:(l) The Lorraine-Luxembourg iron basin reserved foraeroplanes of limited weight, carrying capacity and rangeaetion which could be put at the disposal of the Generalcommanding the Eastern Army Group,(2)    Also for the moment, the metallurgic group of theRuhr district and the Rhine towns below Coblentz, owing totheir distance from our lines and the present weakness ofour resource in regard to the importance and number ofobjectives.     The objectives of this last category will beattacked as soon as the intor-alliod force has a sufficientnumber of long range aeroplanes available, to enable it toattack in an effective manner.
The targets to be bombed by the inter-allied forcewill therefore be in order of urgency:3**     Distant Objectives.(a) The centres of chemical industryLudwigshafen - OppauHoeehst * Leverkussen(b) The industrial and commercial centres of:FrankfortMannheimMainzStuttgartAix-la-ChapelleCoblenzFriedrichehafen(c) The shunting station of Aix-la-Chapelle.2.    Near Objectives.(a) The industrial and commercial centres of:OarlsruheFreiburgSaarbrucken and the railway stations connected withthem.(b) The shunting stations of:EhrangEarthaus ,OffenburgRemelfingen (near Saargemund)SaarbruckenHainsbergen (near Strassburg)In addition the General Commanding the Inter-AlliedForce will be given free scope to attack enemy aerodromeswith a view to paralysing German Air Servioe Units liableto hinder his work.The above scheme can only be put into executionafter approbation of the different Governments concerned.It is in conformity with the wishes of the Militaryrepresentatives of the Supreme War Council, contained in theCollective Note No,35.     It is therefore desirable that thisNote be approved by the French Government and that youshould use your high authority to hasten the consent of theother Allied Governments.As soon as this consent is notified to me, I shallissue the necessary instructions.(3d).

o90 bSUPREME WAR COUNCIL Versailles,3rd August 1918.Military Representatives.M nCRAOUM   NO. 35.BOMBING AIR SERVICE.Having duly noted the Minutes of tho 3rd Meeting of theInterallied Aviation Committoo, the Military Representatives of thSupreme War Council have decided as foilers:-That it is expedient to adopt measures with the leastpossible delay permitting of carrying out powerful and concentratedbombing raids on enemy territory^ both in order to destroy militaryobjectives and to carry out reprisals, should necessity arise, onGerman towns.They therefore consider:1. That as joon as the Allied resources in material andpersonnel permit, an   Interallied Bombing Air Force should beconstituted in the Western theatre of operations composed ofaoroplanoa and capable,of carrying heavy loads and with a largerango of action.This force will be at the entire disposal of the Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Armies in France; vho will appoint itsCommander after consultation vith the Commander*in-Chief of thevarious Allied Armies under his control.2, That it is important to proceed at once to the drawing upof a systematic scheme for bombing enemy towns and industrialcentres, v/ithout waiting for tho formation of this Force, norfor future decisions of the various Governments on the subjootof representations to be made to tho enemy, or of negotiationsundertaken with a view to stopping raids on Allied towns underponalty of reprisals.3. In the case of an Interallied Bombing Air Force beingformed on any of the other Fronts, it is understood that thisForce will also be at the exclusive, disposal of the Generalin-Chief of tho. Armies operating on the Front in question.A bombing scheme will be drawn up for&quot; tho Front inquestion under the same conditions as those already stated withregard to the Western Front.Tho Fronnh H,R. . The British M*R. Tho Italian M.R.at the S.W.C. at the S.W.C. at tho S.W.C.signed Bolin, signed: Saokvillo West,   signed, di Robilant.The American M..R.at the S.W.C.signed.   Bliss,
0 0Tx ,OBJECT.To carry tho war into Germany by attacking hor- industry -   (Munition work)- commerce -   (Economic crisis)- population&apos; -(Demoralisation)These bombing raids on the German population do notproperly speaking constitute reprisals - this like poison gas is ameans ef warfare which was first used by the enemy and which weare therefore forced to use in our turn.XI *SCHLIS3 FOR AERIAL BOMBING.A - Conditions which the, scheme must fulfil.Air raids do not achieve good results unless they areon a largo eO&amp;lc., frequently repeated and form part of amethodical soheme carried out with tenacity.Therefore, objeotiws to be bombed oust fulfil thefollowing conditions.(a) They must be within attacking distance of the-front,Th&apos;-y must be attacked - not intermittently but continuously - notby  a few specially trained men but by whole bombing groups,(b) They must be of sufficient size to present a target fairlyeasy to find and to attacks and such as to make defence difficultand necessitate considerable means of defence.(c) They must be sufficiently stationary for any displacementof the targets out of bombing ran^e to be impossible, the bombingof industrial establishments &quot;only achieving important destructiveresults after some- time,(d) They must be as small in number as is necessary foreffective action to be taken on each one&quot;,,At the same time they must be well scattered, overdifferent districts and at sufficiently different points from theline to enable the Command to take weather conditions intoconsideration in the daily choice of objectives to be bombed andalso to divide up the defences of the enemy.B,    Choice of objectives to form part of the bombingscheme.The examination of the economic situation of Germanyreveals the following principal facts:-1.     The precarious conditions of her iron mlnes?-At least 75$ of iron ere necessary to German consumptioncomes from the Lorraine^Luxemburg iron-ore area comprised byLuxembur^Lort+^wy^J--enauvon-Conflan.s^,letz-Thionvilie. which is entire!within the range of our bombing service and even within that ofour old. type i^achines (Voisin).To paralyse the Lorraine^Luxemburg area is to cut off at

The great concentration of the largo groups of works ofthe iron industry which are necessarily erected in a coal or ironore area.The chief of these groups arej-(a) The Ruhr basin or Rhine-Westfo-lian basin (Essen district)This is by far the moot important (57$ of the total steelproduction of Germany in-1916).It provides excellent and numerous targets such as largefactories and large shunting stations, but they are at a distanceranging between 2o0 and. 320 Km. from the front and therefore it isimpossible to attack them effectively.at any rate this year,(b) The group - f?aar basin, Lorraine Basin and Luxemburg basin(25$ of the total production of Germany in 19l6,(l)*It is between 40 and lOOKm. from the front and cantherefore  be attacked in a consecutive manner but presents a greatnumber of targets,In o4dor to achieve a considerable reduction in theproduction of this area, considerable means are required and evenwere such a reduction obtained, it would not prove a final blowto the metal industry as the chief centre, the :.uhr basin, wouldstill remain untouched.The best way of affecting the German1metal industry at thepresent date appears therefore to -.;c by attacking:-(a) not finished or   manufactured products distributed amongthe numerous districts where they are turned out.(b) nor steel worrs, the chief centre of which is at presentout of our reach (Ruhr basin) but the very source of production,i,6.localised supplies of iron ore the transport of which takes place viacertain obligatory routes,
The Germans have themselves shown tho capitalimportance with regard to the war of the possession and freeexploitation of iron orej the confidential memorandum publishedby German metallurgists (December 1917) is particularlysignificant on tho subject.3*   Shortage and dilapidated condltion of rolling stock,This shortage, revealed alike in official reports andthe press, is the only cause of the coal crisis and consequentlyof the decreased output of a great number of factories) thiscrisis is extraordinary in a country where coal is plentiful andwhere considerable quantities^ of coal are left lying at the minepits.This shortage is so great that it was often statedduring 1917 and the beginning of 1918 in the most authoritativeGerman military centres that:-11 If Germany succumbs it will be due to the laok ofmeans of transport.&quot;Material necessarily becomes accumulated at the largershunting stations where trains are made up and which arerelatively few and it is consequently, here that its destructionshould be attempted with a view to increasing the gravity of thepresent situation.4&quot;   Great size and vulnerability of large chemical centres.The preparation of the chief products used in themanufacture of explosives and poisonous powders and gases isconcentrated in a few very large factories.Thus the concentrated manufacturing centres of thesebasic products should bo attacked and not the numberlessgunpowder/&quot;explosive or poison gas factories which arcdistributed over the whole of Germany and nearly always placedfar from other habitations.The Chief chemical works are situated as follows:-Ludwigshafen - Oppau (over 16000 workmen)HoechatLeverkussen  with works of secondary importance atElberf61dBiebrich nearsMaing,   The Casolls works at Frankfurtand Grie3heil near Frankfurt.Ludwigshafen - Oppau is 160 Km, from the lines.Hoechat 230 %.   &quot;      &quot;      11Levorkusson .250 Km,   &quot;      &quot;      &quot;Of the three chief centres, only Ludwigshafen-Oppau canbe seriously attacked at the present date.   The two remainingcentres must be attacked as coon as means are availableThe destruction of these three factories woulddoubtless considerably Influence the course of the War.

0 &apos;4Jo iXXX *EXECUTION OF TIPS.....SCHEME.CONSTITUTION OF THE INTERALLIED FORCE.A, MEANS OF ACTION.It is more important than ever that the ENTENTE shouldseek a military decision.The only means of obtaining this decision is to employall the aerial andJLand forces on the great principle of concentrationConsequentlya. The main object of the aerial forces should be action inbattle, their action against the interior of Germany although ofundoubted importance from the point of view of economics and morale,can only be secondary.   It should therefore only be undertaken whenfighting requirements have been satisfied or during lulls in thefighting.b. The aerial forces should be placed under the control of theHigh Command, in the 3ame way as the Army, which will decide,according to the situation, the objective, and tho resultant generaldistribution of the whole aerial forces.Two periods must therefore be distinguished in carrying outthe scheme of raids into GERMANY, namely, periods of operation andperiods of stabilisation,1,   During the periods of operation.The requirements of the battlefield must first be satisfiedand aa completely as possible-   ^he importance of these requirementsnecessitates that the majority of the bombing Air Service should takepart in these operations.-   (The scheme of operations drawn up forSpring 1919 provides for the intervention of 2..2G0 bombing aeroplanesin the.fighting out of a total of 3,300 which will be in existenceat this time according to the programmes drav-n up,)The forces still available for attacking the interiorof Germany must thus be very much reduced, they will not howeverbe entirely suppressed; once raids have been started, they shouldbe carried on uninterruptedly, oven with reduced means in order thatthe population may be prevented from recovering, and that tho mean3of defence (aeroplanes and guns) accumulated by the enemy todefend his country, may be maintained far from the battlefield.Consequently a proportion must be established between thoaerial bombing forces intended for operations and of those detailedto continue our attack on Industrial Germany.   This proportioncan only be fixed by the Commander in Chief of the Allied Armies.2*   During tho period of stabilisation.The attack on the interior of Germany becomes the mostimportant task of our bombing Air Servloe,
0 000It is however necressary to maintain sufficient aerialforces at the disposal of the Armies.a. To ensure the supervision of tho front.b. To carry on aerial warfare-by bombings-aerodromes-, especiallythose acting a3 bases for &apos;ralds on PARIS and LONDON by enemyaeroplanes.o.   To bomb objectives, an attack on which appears opportuneto the High Command.The proportion also remains to be fixed of the bombingair service for tho Armies and that intended for attacks onIndustrial Germany, this proportion must also be established bythe Commander in Chief of the Allied Armies in France.On this basis, the interallied Air Foroe detailed forbombing the interior of Germany can be constituted henceforthas follows.British Independent Force In the East.French Bomber Group 2*Italian   &quot; &quot;   18.Subsequently American Flights.The Commander in Chief of the Allied Armies will increase&apos;or reduce the forces composing this unit according tocircumstances, and as he may judge necessary.Fighting Units may be attached under tho same conditionstc the Interallied Air Force in order to facilitate if necessaryday raids,B.   COMMAND.The Interallied Force must have a single command.   Unityof Command is indispensable in order that the preparation andexecution of the scheme of continuity be carried out with theorder and method necessary for successj It can bo accomplished asfollowstrMajor General Trenchard, now in Command of the IndependentForce, to command tho Interallied Air Force engaged in bombingthe Interior of Germany.   He will be assisted by a Staffconsisting of:His present Staff Major.A French Officer.An Italian Officer,An American Officer   (when American Flights areattached to the Interallied Force),General Trenchard will be immediately under the ordersof the Marshal   Commander in Chief of the Allied,Armies - asregards operations.From the territorial point of view and for generaldiscipline he will conform to the instructions of the ^eneralin Command of the Eastern Army Group.
C, PI STUIBUTI ON OF OB Jg CTIVE B...l)     Raids on the iron districts of Lorraino-Luxemburg canhe carried out by aeroplanes having an average load and incon-sidoruble range,For tho greater&apos;homogeneity of the Interallied Forceengaged in bombing Germany, it is advisable to remove aeroplanesof this typo and to detail aeroplanes carrying a heavy load andwith a large range.Under these conditions raids on the iron district mustbo eliminated from the plan of the Interallied Force.   Theseraids will bo carried out by French aeroplanes Jiaving an averageload, in the East under the direct order of the General inCommand of the Eastern Army Group,2)     The remaining objectives arc still too numerous andsome cfi them too distant to permit of all being bombed immediately.They must only bo attacked as the means at tho disposalof the Commander of the Interallied Force permit of heavy andrepeated action in each case.The Commander will designate according to ciroumstances,those   objectives which it is important should bo bombed,Tho Commander of the Interallied Force will dividethese objectives between different units, taking into oonsider-ation the characteristics of the different types of aeroplanesand the circumstances at the moment,Consequently the objectives to be attacked are thefollowingI, The Lorraine-Luxemburg iron basina) Mines and Works - industrial agglomerationsb) Stations controlling the traffic in ore,chiefly KZ,, THIONVILIE, BETTEMBURG andEHRANG and KARTHAUS near TREVES.II, Centres for the manufacture of chemical productsLUDWIGSHAFEN-OPPAU,HOCHST,LEVERKUSSEN.III, Large industrial and commercial centres,.   1) MANNHEIM, STUTTGART, FRANKFORT, COLOGNE,DUS SELDOM?,2) MAINTZ, KARLSRUHE, FREIBURG, COBLENZ, SAARBRUCK-EN, FRIEDRICH3RAFEN, AIX-LA-CHAPELIE.The railway stations supplying these towns would be attackedat the same time,IV, Large sorting stations of Western Germany HAUSBERGENnear Strasburg,KALK NORD near CologneDUSSELDORF*DEREND0RFSAARBRUCKENREJ/1ELFINGEN near SarrequcminesEHRANG and KARTHAUS near TrovesAIX-LA^ CHAPE LIEOFFENBURG near Strasburg.V, The principal metallurgical works of the RhonishWostphalian basin (particularly ESSEN) and of theSARK0 basin.In addition, he can add to the objectives of thescheme, a certain number of secondary objectives Rotweil,
Obendorf, Kaiserslautern etc,) which can Toe bombed whenatmospheric conditions do not permit the principle objectivesto bo reached.     Those attacks will have tho additionaladvantage of keeping the enemy uncertain as to real objectives,of maintaining the population in a state of alarm and ofcompelling the means of defence to be so git to rod.   Neverthelessthey must be reduced to a minimum or dispersion of,effort willresult,3)     The Commander of tho Interallied Force in order tomaintain Aerial supremacy must by stern fighting oppose anyenemy,, air forces who will attempt to hinder the action ofhis units especially his day bombers.   To this end he should&apos;attack enemy aerodromes and destroy them * an essentialcondition to the success of his operations.   This destructionOf aerodromes, - for the same reason - must be undertaken bythe S.A.G., according to the means at its disposal.   Inorder that these raids be conducted methodically, a common planfor the two Aviation Forces is necessary.This plan will be drawn up by General Trenchard.D* &quot;ffSTABIISKliENT OF THE INTERALLIED FORCE.The question has already been discussed by the Inter-allied Aviation Commission which at a meeting on 31st May, 1918,adopted the following resolution&apos;.Each one of the Allies   will have a zone assigned&apos;to it and will take possession of the aerodromes through theintermediary of the local French authorities, according to theusual rules.   The Commander in Chief of the Allied Armieshas the right to take possession of other positions, suitablefor aerodromes and even to commandeer aerodromes alreadyestablished.Outside those zones no aerodromes can be oommandeercdwithout permission from General Duval,
It is necessary to sanction and to state preciselythis decision taking into consideration tho following points.a. The Commander in Chief of the Armies of the Northand tho North-East cannot givo up the control of the zoneswhich arc allotted to the Allied Services, since they will hesituated on territory of,v/hich he is in Command and fromwhence he moot allot all the establishments of the rear.Ho has therefore the right to grant or refuse the sitcaaoked for by the Allied Air Services in their zones.The ncocaoity for providing and obtaining aerodromeroquircmcnto for numerous eventualities will further moreoblige him to roocrvo for himself a certain number of aerodromesin the zones allotted to the Allied Air Services.b.   It is neae33ary to provide for tho return to the LooalCommand of all aerodrome a placed at the dispooal of tho Allied,J.r Service should tho situation render neocosary the occupationcf these aerodromes by the Air Service units required to take partin &apos;the fighting.In Consequence, the arrangements of the aerodromesbelonging to the bombing Air Service for raids on Germanycould be as follows:-1,-  A 3peoial zone of aerodromes is allotted - inprinciple *- to each of the allied Air Service which form part &apos;of a force intended to carry out raids on Gormany.The Limit3 of these zones for the Briti3h and -unerioanBombing Services, arc indicated on the map enclosed.   TheItalian Air Service will be placed in the French Zone,2,   The Allied Air Service will choose their aerodromeswithin the zones allotted to them; this choice wi11 besubmitted to the approval of the Commander in Chief of thoFrench Armies in the North and North-East,3.   a certain number of aerodromes situated outsidetheir zones, could, as far as he considers possible be placedby the Commander in Chief at the disposal of the Allied AirServices, but they must be returned to him upon request at24 hours notice.   The Allied Air Services are not to establishon these aerodromes units for night flying,4,   Within the zones of tho British and Amerioan aerodromesthe Commander in Chief of tho Frcnctj Armies of the North andNorth-East, may lay out and reserve a oertain number ofaerodromes, in the oasc of active operations on the front of thoE.H.Q.   When these aerodromes are- free, they will bo placedat the diopo3al of the Allied Air Services,5,   The Commander in Chief of tho Allied Forces reserves tohimself tho right, should tho situation render it necessary, toorder the evacuation of the whole or of a part of tho aerodromesoccupied by the allied bombing unit3 and to put these aerodromesat the disposal of the General Commanding operations in theEast, in order to establish thc3c tho Air Service units whicharc to take part in the battle,6o   The Commander in Chief of the Fronoh. armie3 of theN. &amp; N,E. is responsible for the organisation of the whole of theallied bombing units in the East, the aerial night routes andthe establishment of signals.No special arrangements of lights or of night signalsarc t*d be established without his authorisation.
fit    070 wREPLY TO Mi CLEk NCEAU&apos;S NOTE OF THE 24TH SEPTEMBER, 3.918,OM THE SUBJECT OF THE CREATION OF AH IHTER-ALLISDBOMBING FORCE,His Majestyrs Government have had before themLUClemenceau^s Note of the 24th September, 1918, on the subjectof the constitution of an Inter-Allied Long. Range Bombing Force,together with Marshal Foch&apos;s memorandum of tloe 14th September, onthe same subject.Theyhave noted with much satisfaction that both thePresident of the Council and Marshal Foch are in full accordwith the principle of the long range bombing of Germany, bothas to its strategical value and as to the methods proposed andin operation for giving effect thereto.They have further noted that the future Inter-Alliedcharacter of these operations is accepted&apos; and that the FrenchGovernment anticipate that French squadrons will shortly boavailable to take part in this work,  -The question of the autonomous character of GeneralTrenchard&apos;s command is, therefore, the sole question of majorimportance upon which there is outstanding   a. difference ofopinion between the two Governments,    The&quot; arguments on both sideshave been fully traversed at meetings of the Inter-Allied AviationCommittee, and in tho various memoranda under review, and it isnot proposed to re-enter into them hero.At the same time, His Majestyrs Government desire torepeat that in taking up the attitude   on this subject which theyhave adopted hitherto, they have been influenced only by thedesire to constitute this Force in such a way as to ensure thatits primary function, namely, that of the long distance bombingof German industrial targets, shall be paramount to all others,and that personal considerations relative to the command of theForce have in no way weighed with them.His Majesty1s Government have very carefully consideredthe whole problem and are strongly of opinion than an even greatereffect on Germany than has hitherto been achieved will result froma direct air offensive intthe event of a later stabilisation of theline nearer Germany,Cn the other hand, tho potential, disintegration of theenemy&apos;s battle front represents a condition which was not previouslyexistent, and justifies a reconsideration of the method proposedfor the employment of the Force,It should be pointed out that when the scheme of theIndependent Force was formed, the British Government had, accordingto the opinion of their military advisers, to contemplate theprospect of a continuance of defensive warfare throughout 1918and possibly 1919 on the linos then constituting the battle front.It became, therefore, of the very highest importance to developAc the utmost the arm which alone offered the opportunity ofCarrying an offensive into the heart of Germany,   In the presentcircumstances, as Marshal Poch points out, it is possible tocontemplate a fluid and progressive line of battle with thepossibility of achieving a rapid and victorious advance of theAllied Armies into Germany itself.
In such an emergency it is recognised that thedifficulties of transport and administration, etc., aro such t\a long range bombing forco can most effectively operate under iimmediate command of the Commander-in-Chiof of the Allied Armiesand it is for those reasons that the British Government aroprepared to accede to the request of the French Government thatGeneral Trenchardfs Force shall be placed under the supreme coinof harshal Foch.The points of principlo raised in iu Clomenceau(s Noteand the accompanying papers alone have been dealt v/ith.    In sop,points of detail, and in particular, in regard to some of theviews therein expressed as to the tactical use of a bombingforce, the British Government are not in complete accord, onthe general ground that to secure success, a wide latitude as totargets and complete freedom as to tactics must be given to theCommander of. the bombing foroe.    General Trenchard should,therefore, be accorded the position of a Commander*in-Chief,having the full control of the tactical employment of his forcewhich is accorded to other Commandcrs-in-Chief under the termsof the Beauvais Agreement of 3rd April, 1918.    They do not, inthese circumstances, feel that it would be profitable for themnow to attempt to discuss and settle such points of detail whichthey believe can be most speedily and satisfactorily settled bya personal arrangemont between the Generalissimo and GeneralTrenchard.His liajesty&apos;s Government being prepared to as-sent tothe subordination of the Independent Forco to tho Generalissimo,there now appears to bo no obstacle to a final agreement betweenthe two Governments as to the constitution of the Force.    Thereis appended hereto the proposed heads of agreement which it ishoped will receive the approval of li. Clemonoeau on behalf of thiFrench Government, and v/hich can be ratified by the AlliedGovernments at the next meeting of the Supreme War Council.As soon as M. Clemencoau has notified his approval^General Trenchard.will forthwith be notified of the arrangement,and it is suggested that a copy of the agreement should be forwaed to Marshal Foch in order that tho detailed arrangements for Uconduct of operations may be settled between them.3rd October 1918.
Heads of agreement as to the constitution of the Inter-AlliedIndependent Air Force,1,    Tho object of the Force,To carry war Into Germany by attacking her industry,commerce and population,2.    The Plan of Campaign*Air raids must be on a large scale and repeated, formingpart of a methodical plan .and carried on with tenacity.3.    Execution of the Plan,iThe complete realisation of this scheme is not to beundertaken until the imperative requirements of the fightinghave been satisfied or during the intervals   of the fighting.It will, therefore, bo possible to carry out this planin two ways according to circumstances.(a)   During periods of active operations.The requirements of battle will have to be mot first,thus reducing in varying proportions the strength of forcesavailable for raids on the interior of Germany.    The bombingaction being begun will, however, have to bo pursued evenwith a reduced atroagth.(h)   During steady or quiet periods.Bombing raids on the interior of Germany become thechief work of our bombing squadrons.   Having satisfied the AirService requirements of the Army, all available long rangeaeroplanes will be froe to take part in the raids,4*    The establishment of the Inter-Allied^&apos; independent&apos;&quot; HrTorce.This establishment will include Allied Plights ef heavyweight carrying aeroplanes with a wide radius of aotion, and willprobably be reinforced later by further available Allied Plightsof the same type.*     The Force will be placed under the command of GeneralTrenchard, as Commander-in-Chief, assisted by a staff includingbesides the present staff, an officer of eaoh of the Nationsrepresented in the Bombing Force.General Trenchard will be under the Supreme Command of MarshalPoch for operations,5.    The name of the Force shall be the Inter-Allied IndependentAir Force.cOctober, 1918.
