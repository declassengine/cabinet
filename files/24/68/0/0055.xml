[This Document is the Property-of His Britannic JEajeatyb Government.;Printed for the War Cabinet.   October 1918.SECRET.MAN-POWER IN 1918-1919.I CIRCULATE a memorandum which has been prepared in the Ministry ofMunitions.WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.October 23, 1918.With reference to the memorandum of the 10th September by the Minister ofNational Service on the above subject (War Cabinet Paper G.T.-5660), it appears to benecessary to make the following comments and proposals : 1. In regard to Sir Auckland Geddes&apos; proposals in Part II as to exceptions inconnection with the release by the Ministry of Munitions of Grade 1 men born in1900-(a.) &quot; Iron and steel&quot; should be read in the widest sense, so as to include stampingsand forgings, bolts and nuts, &amp;c.(&amp;:) &quot; Tanks&quot; should include tanks and parts thereof and accessories,(c.) &quot; Guns &quot; should include guns and parts thereof and accessories; and(d.) &quot; Aero-engines and parts thereof should be added to the list.2. The strongest support should be given to the views expressed by Sir AucklandGeddes as to the necessity of exercising every possible economy in the use of skilledmen in the combatant services, and it should be pressed very strongly that everypracticable step be taken to this end. The Ministry of Munitions have definiteinformation that the officials and members of skilled Trade Unions are continuallyreceiving news from their fellow-members in the army, even in technical units, and frommen in the lower medical categories, that oheir skill is not being utilised, with theresult that opposition to dilution of labour and recruitment of skilled men is steadilyand consistently hardening.3. It appears that Sir Auckland Geddes does not propose that there should be anyfurther recruiting of skilled men from munitions work, except of men of 18 years ofage who are not employed in the excepted occupations. It should, however, beemphasised that, if the present programmes of munitions production are to be realised,it will be a matter of the greatest difficulty to release any further skilled men at all.The recruiting of the skilled men of 18 years of age, even with the exceptions specified,represents a greater loss of labour than the munitions industries can afford.4. There is also the fact that in certain of the munitions trades there is now aserious shortage of men having the requisite degree of skill or experience or physicalstrength essential to maintain the necessary output. The processes of dilution andsubstitution have continually extended, and this has been compulsorily advanced bythe heavy recruiting from munitions industries during the present year. This policy isstill being carried into effect to a modified degree, but in many cases any furtherextension is becoming more and more difficult, and even impossible, owing to the factthat suitable substitutes can no longer be found in civil life, or that skilled supervisorsare wanting. Plant and machinery are standing idle for want of suitable labour, andnumbers of unskilled workers cannot be given employment for want of skilledsupervisors.5. It is essential, therefore, if munitions programmes are to be carried out, thatconsiderable numbers of men should be returned from the army to work uponmunitions.6. Departmental arrangements have recently been made between the Admiraltyand the Ministry of Munitions, the Ministry of National Service, and the War Office,for releases up to 500 men per month jointly for the Admiralty and Ministry of[908]
2Munitions. This arrangement is practically confined to the release of men who areserving at home, and who are over a certain age, varying according to their medicalclassification. It does not affect the release of men belonging to artificer trades, andthere are restrictions on the number of men who may be withdrawn from any particularunit. Each application is subject to veto, and this arrangement, therefore, whilstvaluable in itself, is quite inadequate to make good the losses caused by the operationof the &quot; clean cut&quot; and the rapid recruitment of 1895-7 men.7. In addition, the War Cabinet have specially sanctioned for the Ministry ofMunitions the release of 400 men for blast furnaces, 700 for stampings and forgings,and 325 men for tanks (including certain Tank Corps men).8. In regard to tanks, it has become apparent that the4 number of 325 alreadyauthorised will form a quite insufficient complement to the available civilian labourto carry out the Tank programme. The Tank Board estimate that with thepresent labour available for tank production the number of tanks produced bySeptember of next year cannot exceed 4,256, whilst with an additional 3,500 skilledmen the production would be increased over the same period to 6,338, or an increase ofone tank for every 17 additional skilled men.It is already clear that these men cannot be secured from existing civilian sources,particularly as it is necessary that the equivalent for tanks, e.g., guns, opticalmunitions, &amp;c, must keep pace with the output of tanks themselves.It, appears, therefore, to be a matter for consideration and decision by the WarCabinet whether the release of 3,500 skilled men from the combatant services is worthan additional 2,082 tanks by the end of September next.9. In addition, there are many other types of munitions for which the demand forlabour is equally pressing. The unsatisfied demand for labour for the most urgent gunequipments is 1,700 skilled men, required mainly for the 18-pr., 6-pr., and 6-inchMark XIX equipments. The position in regard to material supply for these equipmentsis good, and labour supply is the limiting factor. Though 1,700 is given as theirreducible minimum if War Office demands axe to be met, a present release of 500 men&quot; on account&quot; specially for this work would effect an immediate improvement inproduction.The Aircraft Production Department contemplate the employment of an additional25,000 workpeople on their aero-engine programme, provided that 450 skilled tool-roomhands are forthcoming. Scientific and optical instruments, poiscn gas, waggonrepairing, rolling mills, and manufacture of steel, copper, and other metals, bolts andnuts, &amp;c, are other types of munitions work for which most urgent demands for labourare being made, which it is quite impossible to meet from civilian sources.10. It is clear, therefore, that if the production of munitions is to continue on thescale required, War Cabinet authority should be obtained for the release of men fromthe army and the air force up to a total of 7,000.Attached is a schedule of trades in which the most important labour demands formunitions exist, and to which, therefore, the 7,000 men applied for should in the mainbelong. It may be added that the unsatisfied labour demands in these occupationsalready notified amount to about 25,000.11. Considerable delay has been experienced in the past in securing the release ofmen up to the numbers authorised by the War Cabinet, owing to difficulties being putin the way of releasing particular men applied for. Other things being equal,applications would as far as possible, be limited to men of the lower medical categoriesand to men serving in this country, but it is clear from previous experience that if thereleases authorised are to be effective, it should be laid down that release should not berefused or delayed on the ground that a man is Grade 1, or serving overseas, or in atechnical corps.Schedule.Showing by Trades the number of men required to be released from the Forces forUrgent War Munitions Work. %1.
