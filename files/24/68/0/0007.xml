is document ie the property of His Britannia $faj&amp;BWa Government )iG EC E E T,W A RGAB IKE ToNAVAI TEBMS 03? AN ARMISTICE.My dear H^nkey,,1 attach notes of the remarks which I made to the War Cabinetat the Meeting on Monday last.   As the Meoting was subject to a goodmany intorruptiens it was very difficult to bo consecutive,   Theycontain romarks which were made to the.Cabinet as a whole and toMembers of the War Cabinet individually which in all probability&apos; .neither you-nor the Prime Minister were aware of.   And I considorthat the Prime Minister should bo acquainted with everything that Isaid io individual Members do that he should bo raoro thoroughly con-versant with what I had in my mind.Bid details of the minor Points of the Naval forms I assumewill be discussed late*.,.        There are among them several of great importance.   Forihsiance the surrender of Heligoland.&apos;Thero is one that was not mentioned in the terms at all - i.e0Tho Baltic Question,      It is a question of the greatest importancefrom the Naval point of view.&apos;    Under existing conditions the Balticis closed to Groat Britain and her illios, a state of affairs whichconstitutes a serious challenge to our command of the sea^aIt was to exercise our Maritime Eights and keep open the Balticand its trade that Nelson fought at Copenhagen.    You as a student ofNaval history will rocogniso that we cannot tolerate interference withthe no,cessity of upholding the principles for which wo have foughtin the past, and on, the maintenance of whioh the security of thisCountry deponds.I hope these notes will bo of help to you in compiling,theMinutes of the Mooting. . I should bo vory sorry to have to undortakoyour task.      I would have sont thorn earlier - I made them in theTrain on my way North while, thoy were fresh in my mind.    Unfortunatelymy own Secretary who typed thorn has been hors de. combat, with a coldand I did not like to turn them over to anyone&apos; clse9I sent a copy to the. First Sea Lord&apos;who I can safely say is inperfe-et agreement with them.Provided the situation will permit I oan at any. time be at theService of the Prime Einistor when he thinks it dosirablo to discussthe question again,Yours sincerely,(signed)   DAVID BEATTY,
; &apos;&quot;&apos;  The views of the Commander-in-gliiof. Grand Fleet, as expressed-. at, the !&apos;;ar Cabinet Meeting on Mono ay, 21st October, to tho&quot;^Cabinet as a whole, and to individual members of the Cabinettin the subject of ;-&quot;THE NAVAL TERMS OF AJST AHvilSTICE1. - I assumed that the object of the \&apos;ar was:&quot;The destruction of Gorman Militarism&quot;,From the Naval point of view:-&quot;The destruction of German Sea Power&quot;.2.- 1 asked whether the general circumstances .of thewar from the military point of view made it necessary or desirablethat we should have an Armistice ?    If the answer was in theaffirmative,. I recognised that the Naval terms proposed: wouldmost certainly prevent it at this juncture.   If, however, theEnemy condition&apos;was such as would cause them to accept the Militaryterms as outlined by the Field Marshal, then ijfywas possible thatthey would- accept also the Naval terms.3.- The Military .successes have been great, and theMilitary terms are commensurate with their achievements.     xheNavy made them possible and therefore shares in them.The Navy also has wen a great Passive Victory, has sweptthe Enemy-from the weaa, rendered secure the vast lines of     &apos; ,.&quot;communications with our Allies, and permitted the trade of thiscountry-, necessary for existence, to continue.     Because oursis a Passive victory,, it , is no reason why the Empire should notreap the fruits of that victory,4.- We have built up a great Military organization,but the British nation still exists on Sea Oower.-   Although aplatitude, it is one which will bear constant repetition,;thateven though we gain many victories on land,&apos;one defeat at sea,;and the Allies cause is lost.. Inversely we may be defeated andcrushed on land, but if we maintain our supremacy at- Sea, theEmpire will weather the storm. . &apos;Therefore in framing our Naval terms, since theexistence, of the Empire depends on our Sea Power, we must ensrre thatno Fleet in being is left which can threaten&apos;our supremacy.   Nocompromise on this vital point is possible. *If there is to be elasticity in the terms of theArmistice, it must be on the Military side and not on the Naval side.It must be our particular care to safeguard the Navalside of any Armistice with the enemy.   Our Allies as land po ersmay be expected to safeguard the Military side,I 5.- The question as to what approximation the&apos; Termsof Armistice should have to the Terms of- Peace. . *It was apparently the opinion of the Cabinet thatthe,time between arriving at ah Armistice and signing- the  ermsof Peace would be long., even possibly as much as twelve months.It was also
It was also accepted that after living under conditions of anArmistice for so long, the possibility of returning to warconditions was highly improbable.During the Armistice, and in arranging the Terms of Peace,assuming the bast will in the world, friction was bound toarise between the Allies, which would be intensified by theaction of Germany who would devote every effort to sowingdissension..These factors make it very desirable that the terms of theArmistice should be as nearly as possible the Terms of Peace,Therefore the Naval Terms of the Armistice must be stiff and suchthat will achieve, one of the objects for which we are fighting&quot;The destruction of German Sea Power&quot;.6.-   To achieve the destruction of German Sea Power andreduce Germany to the status of a second rate Naval Power, it &apos;is necessary to lay down in the Naval Terms of the Armisticeconditions which would be commensurate with the result of aNaval Action, i.e. the result of the Armistice should be whatwe expect would be the result of a Naval Action as regards therelative strength of the,two Forces.     The question had be.enasked whether it would not be sufficient for the Enemy tosurrender the whole of their Submarines without humiliatingthem to the extent that would be entailed by surrendering theships laid down in the Naval Terms.        I attach more importanceto the surrender of the surface units of the High Sea Fleetthan even to the whole of the Submarine Fleet.The Power behind the Submarine warfare of the Enemy Is theHigh Sea Fleet.   Remove,that Power and the Submarine menacewould completely collapse.   The removal of the High Sea Fleetwould allow of the whole of the Forces of the Grand,Fleet beingset free to tackle the Submarine menace at its source, i.e.the Enemy bases.The Bases could be ringed in by Mine Barriers, obstructionsand nets, which could be guarded by comparatively light Patrols,which could be continuous and of sufficient strength ascircumstances required.The removal therefore of the High Sea Fleet means theremoval of the one Naval menace - The Submarine.On the other hand if we insist on the handing over ofEnemy Submarines and&apos;leave the High Sea Fleet intact, then the&apos;position of affairs, so far as the relative Naval strength isconcerned, is precisely the same as that which obtained at thecommencement of hostilities.During four years of war the enemy has built up a hv.g&amp;Submarine Fleet.      In four years of peace he can do all andmore than this, and with the High Sea Fleet in being, andassuredly stronger than ever, Germany will again menace the SeaPower cf Great Britain.As a consequence, Sea Power being vital to our existence,excessive expenditure on armament will be entailed at a timewhen the economic effect of such expenditure is likely to beserious.Remove the power of the High Sea Fleet now, and definitelyreduce the continental nation of Germany to that of a secondrate Naval Power, corresponding to her geographical position andrequirements, and our position at .saa is at once secured.The threat of the Submarine disappears,, and Great Britain.inthe future will be spared a race with Germany for Sea supremacy.In stating
In stating that Germany should be reduced to the status of a Second Class Naval Power corresponding to her requirements, is assumed that there was no intention of returning to Germany her lost colonies.

7.- It is noted that in the exchange of Notes between President Wilson and the enemy, the Naval side of the matter had not been referred to.

Doubtless President Wilson in using the term "Military" intended to include Naval, Army, and Air questions. This, however, was not clear and Germany will certainly, and in fact has, kept the discussion to the land side only.

It is very essential that the Naval side should be kept clearly before the Allies and dealt with separately and apart from the Military side.
