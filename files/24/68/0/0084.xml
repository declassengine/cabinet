Priority forbuilding materials and labour&quot;.Memorandum by the President of the Board of Agriculture andFisheries.Under tho Small Holding Colonies Act, 1016, the Board ofAgriculture and Fisheries have acquired 2,363 acres at Patrington,Sast Riding, Yorkshire;   1,000 acres at Holbeaoh, Lincolnshire;1150 acres at Heath Hill, Salop and 1,345 acres at Pembrey,Carmarthenshire.In order to make this land available for the settlement ofsoldiers and sailors certain building and constructional work isnecessary:   this work consists chiefly of the erection of thecottages required on the holdings and of the essential farm buildingsand it is estimated that at present prices the work required willcost about  22,000.    In the case of Holbeach aboyt 60 per cent ofthe work required has already been completed;   ar Patrington thegreater part of the cottages have been erected,   but work has onlyrecently been commenced on the other Colonies.A serious difficulty has arisen with regard to theprovision of the skilled labour required for putting up thesebuildings, as the national Priority Committee of the Ministry ofNational Service, in the absence of direct instructions from theWar Cabinet, decline to grant a higher priority for the bricklayersand carpenters required than Priority 2.    All skilled labour ofthe standard required is absorbed by work for which Super-Priorityand Priority 1 have been granted and the Board are in consequencefaced with the danger that the equipment of their Colonies willcome to a standstill, and that even the small provision the Boardhave been abl3 to make of land for soldiers and sailors will not beready for thera on demobilisation.In this connection it should be noted that the LandSettlement Committee of the Cabinet have now submitted (G.225)proposals providing for a considerable sura to be placed at thedisposal of County Councils for the equipment of land acquired forthe settlement of ex-service men.If sanction for the expenditure of this money is given, theland will be of no service for its purpose without buildings.   Inorder to ensure that any beginning oan be made with the settlementof discharged service men, Priority 1 should be available for theskilled labour that will be required for erecting the necessarycottages and farm buildings on this land.I am accordingly cf opinion that, if the schemes to provideland for soldiers and sailors are to be carried out without delay,instructions should be given to the National Labour Priority Coramitteof the Ministry of National Service that the skilled labour requiredin connection with the equipment of the Board1s Colonies an^ of otherland acquired for the settlement of ex-service men, should be givenpriority not lower than Priority 1.R. 3, PR0TH3RO.ard of Agriculture and Fisheries,5th November, 1918.
