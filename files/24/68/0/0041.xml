O^IgAL IIT (TO B1UTI3H ETfflKE(Uomorandiim by Hr.YJalter Lonj)My attention has boon called to tho Memorandum on thoInvestment of Porolpn Capital In tho British Empire, dated14th October, 1918 (3*D.D.C. 45 3^ which has boon eirculatodto tho War Cabinet by Lord Robert Cecil.    I cannot altogetheraccent what is said in this Memorandum as to tho policy of thoColonial Oificc in this matter.    I think it dosirablo there-fore to state briefly the attitude adoptod by my Department.Trinidad has boon l:nov:n for sovoral years to bo tholargest ana. most promising Oil-field in tho Itapiro, \vitli thoexception of Burmah.    At tho urgent roouest of tho Admiralty-it was decided gone time before tho v/ar that only oompani.esunder British control should be allowed to win oil on landsleasod   direct from the Grown.    Tho object was to socuroBritish control of the supply of c, material whioh is- ossontialto our national do fence.    Tho scmo policy was adopted, beforetho war on tho sane grounds in regard to bauxite deposits.Ho attempt was however made to intorforo with tho developmentof Oil on private lands in Trinidad or olsewhoro, and it is.not at present proposed to restrict tho rights of privatoowners to dispose of their property.    Honco it is that the.&apos;.morican Company referred to in the Memorandum has boon froe. todevelop tho oil deposits on its own property.It was,   aov/ovor, brouaht to our notice that suspiciousforeign   interests wore trying   to acquire oil properties,and at the request of the A.dniralty a law was passed for-biddinp the acquisition of oil bearing lands/withouty Copy annexed.
186without the Governor&apos;b consent.     This is a temporary warmeasure, *whioh will come to an ond soon after the war.The policy of the Colonial Office is not to denyto foreigners tho owning or developing of property in thoColonies.     Our policy is to restrict the exploitation ofCrown lands for certain materials which are essential to ournational safety to British Corporations,     In other words weclaim the right of every landlord to choose his tenant, butwe only exercise that right in the case of a small number ofmaterials in respect of which there exist definite nationalgrounds for excluding foreign control, such as petroleum,bauxite, tungsten and a few others.The Malay States legislation in regard to rubberland, to which reference hat] been made, was dictated by otherconsiderations.     In this case it was thought essential&apos; to .prevent Japanese, who are not liable to excess profits tax,from buying up land required by British companies for theirfuture development.     This was done by a temporary war measureforbidding transfers, and applicable both to British and toforeign companies,The policy of allowing foreigners to exploit ourall too insufficient oil resources subject to the safeguardsindicated has been considered and rejected on the grounds(inter alia) that it gives us no security against foreigncombinations, and above all leaves us to deal with a pos-sibly hostile control during the period of tension precedinga war.So far as petroleum is concerned the question isone in which the Admiralty are mojjo interested than the ColonialOffice, and I suggest that the views of /that Department-might be obtained with advantage,,.

(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS gRITAMIC MAJSSTJJS GOEvTUMSNT.)SECRET.WAR CABINET.E.D.D.C./45.ECONOMIC DEFENCE AND DEVELOPMENT COJOITTEE,INVESTMENT OF FOREIGN CAPITAL IN THE BRITISH EMPIRE.(Memorandum by Lord R. Cecil)Lord Robert Cecil would &quot;be glad to learn the views&apos;of the EconomicDefence and Development Committee on the questions of policy involvedin the following, case:-Trinidad has been discovered to possess oil.     One oil-producingproperty has already passed into the hands of a Company which, thoughnominally British, is under American control.   Negotiations were opened&apos;for the sale of a second property to a Norwegian group.   At this junc-ture the Governor of Trinidad was instructed by the Colonial Office topass an ordinance prohibiting the acquisition of oil-bearing propertiesin Trinidad without the consent of the Governor.   The Ordinance, whilegeneral in expression, was intended to prevent oil properties from paBs-ing under foreign control,   The sale to the Norwegian Company was thu3prevented from being carried out.The  &quot;Norwegian Government have now intervened on behalf of the Nor-wegian Company and have instructed the Norwegian Minister in London topress the matter.   The Colonial Office propoSu that ho should be toldfrankly that no further oil-bearing lands in Trinidad will be permittedto pass under foreign control, i,e., that we intend to discriminate.be-tween British and foreign companies,The general question amounts to this:.   Is the Oitnii^gand developingof properties within the British Empire or at any rate in Britishpossessions which are not self-governing, to be denied to foreigners,whether individuals or companies ? The whole tendency of the ColonialOffice is in favour of such denial, and this principle has been assertedin the case of rubber lands in the Malay States.While we should insist on certain safe-guards, it seems very doubt-ful whether it is good policy for a country like   the United Kingdomwhich depends more than any other both on foreign investments and ondrawing raw material&apos; from foreign lands,, to set an example of exclusive-ness.   On the other hand articles essential to national security standin a particular category and special treatment may be justifiable in su cases.     Lord R. Cecil understands that the Petroleum Executive are veryapprehensive in regard to the shortage of oil in the British Empire, andthe Admiralty and Board of Trade representatives on Lord Harcourfs OilPolicy Committee share the views of the Colonial Office.Lord R. Cecil is inclined to think that a judicious policy would bjeto allow o,il-bearing lands to pass under foreign control with a provis-ion entitling the imperial or local authorities to take possession incase of national emergency, and for that purpose to have officers con-troll ng or inspecting the management of the Company,It may be added as regards the particular case.which has arisen thatthe Anglo-Norwegian Treaty of 1826 contains no stipulations as regardsthe acquisition and possession of property; but many of our Treatieswith other countries provide for &quot;national&quot; treatment in this respect,whilst others provide for most favoured nation treatment.It should be borne in mind in this connection that important Britishoil interests are engaged in enterprises in foreign;countries and anypolicy which we may adopt is likely to be reflected in the attitude offoreign Governments towards those interests.OREIGN OFFICE, S.W.October 14th, 1918.
