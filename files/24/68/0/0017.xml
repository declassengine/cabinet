r   (7Contracts/Labour/4228,WAR CABINET&apos;,C01TTROL 01 WAGES . K gKeuorandum by the Secretary of State for War.1,     I should like to invite the attention of the ^&apos;farCabinet to &amp; special aspect of this important subject.   Theco-ordination of the administration of rates of y/ages ofworkpeople directly employed by Government, which has beenlacking during the war as it was before war broke out, has beenrecently prcosed upon the attention of the War Cabinet, andmeasures for securing adequate co-ordination are being activelyconsidered,2,    But as regards the control of wages paid bycontractors, the portion is still less satisfactory.   Thereimmediately arises in this connection the question ao betweenthe Contracting Departments (the War Office, etc.) on the onehand and the Ministry of Labour on the other hand, as to theirrespective functions in regard to the exercise of control overwages agreements made between employers and employees, on whichquestion there has &quot;been correspondence with the Ministry ofLabour,3,    The War Office has long been acutely conscious of theinconvenience which results from the independent action ofvarious Contracting Departments in sanctioning increases ofwages in the trades with which they are individually comcerned,either without knowledge,of, or without adequate regard to, theeffect of such increases on the interests of other Departments -and on the general rages level of the country.   The urgent needof securing greater co-ordination in the regulation of wageshas also been recognised in several of the instructions issuedby the War Cabinet, e.g. their Minute No. G.T.2772A of 27thNovember last, constituting the War Cabinet Labour Committee,laid down that &quot;negotiations in the Departments for thesettlement of disputes and of wages questions, whether byagreement, order, or otherwise, should be conducted with aview (a) to confining concessions within the general limits ofthe decisions given by the Committee on Production, or (b) todealing with inequalities within an industry or class&quot;, and that&quot;all settlements must be subject to ratification by the co-ordinating authority&quot;.   It is assumed that the transfer to thoministry of Labour of the duties of the War Cabinet LabourCommittee was not intonded to alter the policy thus laid down,and this view io confirmed by the later instructions circulatedto Departments&apos; by the War Cabinet on 6th February (Minute llo.0.T.3P41), which emphasise the necessity of adhering to tire rulethat &quot;all applications for an increase in war advances andwwage3disputes arising therefrom shall be  referred to the Ministry ofLabour for decision, who may refer them to the Committee onProduction,   The Ministry of Labour will have discretion to askthe Departments concerned to carry en any necessarynegotiations, but the final de&amp;ision will in all cases rest withthe Ministry of Labour&quot;.4...  Having regard to these pronouncements by the War5Cabinet the War Office has taken the view that the responsibilityfor giving or withholding sanction on behalf of the Government&quot;to war advances of ragec agreed upon between employers andworkers in trades in which this Department is interested, isone w\ich must rest with the Ministry of Labour, and thai it iothe duty of the War Office to refer the parties to suchagreements to that Ministry, and to refuse, as far as possible,to recognise or give effect to the agreements until itssanction has been obtained.   The Ministry of Labour, on theother hand, holds that it &quot;has no authority to endorse or-   - . . - . approve
approve of agjre^ents, its functions arise only in cases ofS  l?S4 J^tl f I   fp&quot; betwe en employ era and workpeople&quot; (circularlett er&quot;T5&apos;&apos;&apos;Govornmcnt Departments of SPtii January, 1918).   Thisview, hovevec, appears to ignore the fact that the Ministry, aothe repository of the powers formerly &quot; vested in the War Cabinetlabour Committee, has powers beyond those vested in the ChiefIndustrial Commissioner for dealing with disputes056    Prom the point &quot;of view of the War Office thedifficulties of the position may be stated as follows(i)   Employers and employed frequently enter intoagreements for the payment of increased rate of wages.Under normal circumstances, when the employers have adirect interest in keeping down the labour cost ofproduction, this method of avoiding or settlinglabour disputes by mutual agreement is stronglyencouragedo   When employers&apos; associations and Jjradesooieties have agreed upon   an increase of wages, orwhen it is paid by the majority of employers, the newrate automatically becomes the standard xate for theindustry in the district obneerned, and it is the dutyof Government Departments, under the 3?air WagesBesolution of the House of Commons, to enforce itspayment under all Government contracts and sub-oontracts(ii)   Under the existing abnormal conditions, when the bulkof the output in a large number of trades is required,directly or indirectly, for Government purposes, andwhen the small proportion available for civilianconsumption can command such inflated prices that thelabour cost of production is relatively unimportant,the normal inducements to keep down v,?ages sease tooperate upon the employer, since the extra cost ofwages advances can readily be passed on to theconsumer (ultimately, as a rule, the Government)c   Ittherefore pays him to keep on good terms with labourby agreeing- to extravagant advances provided thatthese can be earmarked as limited to the war period,and in certain cases, where the contractors&apos; profittakes the form of a percentage on the cost ofproduction;, (a form of contract which, it should bestated, is now avoided by the War Office whereverit Is possible to provide for a fixed remuneration),there is an actual financial incentive for him to payinflated rates.   There is thus a serious danger that,,advances made by mutual agreement may be due tocollusion between employers and workers, and may haveno real relation to any actual increase in the costof living,(iii)    Contracting Departments (unless, as in the cases ofthe Ministry of Munitions, they havo specialstatutory powers of controlling wages) have no powerto prevent collusive agreements of this kind; onthe contrary, as has already been pointed out, when ;the agreement has been made, it is their duty underthe Fair Wages Resolution to enforce its observanceon all   their contractorsThey can, indeed ( andthe War Office does), ao regards current oontracts,refuse to recognise such an agreement as&quot; a ground forgranting an increase of price to cover the extra cootof paying the increased rates; but this is not aneffective means of bringing pressure to bear on theemployer because ao soon as con bracts in existence atthe&apos;:   &apos;date of thy advance come to an ondV, either bycompletion or by exercise of the contractor&apos;r powerof
of lamination, the Department, if it still needs thecontractor&apos;s services, must enicr into a new contractwith him, in fixing his price for which he will ofcourse take account of the increased labour cost dueto the advancee   In the long run,* therefore, there isno possible means of preventing the cost of suchadvances falling upon the State.(iv)   The difficulty cannot be met by inducing the partiesto submit the matter to the recognised Governmentarbitration tribunals in order to establish that, theadvance is justified on its merits, beoause both theCommittee on Production and the Chief IndustrialCommissioner take the view that they have no locusstandi to pronounce upon a rate when it is accepted byboth employers and employed^ but can only give anaward when there is an actual dispute between theparties p6.     It is therefore apparent that there is no effectivemeans available to the War Office for preventing agreements ofthis kind from taking effect, and in these circumstances theview of the Department is that the Ministry of Labour, aotingnot as an arbitrator but as the successor to the pov/ers andduties formerly vested in the War Cabinet Labour Committee, andthe Department responsible for announcing and carrying out thepolicy of the Government in labour questions, should take theresponsibility of deciding as to the propriety of such anagreement, and of disapproving it if the wages advance proposedwould not be admissible on the principles adopted by theCommittee op Production in determining its awards,7*    There are in the opinion of the War Office seriousobjections to this responsibility being left to be dischargedindependently by the various Contracting Departments:-(l)   It is felt that thiswould result in each suchDepartment being a law to itself in deciding whethera particular agreement is &quot;within the general limitsof the decisions given by the Committee on Production&quot;,and, apart from such a position being incompatible withany real co-ordination, experience has shown thatDepartments primarily responsible for supply are aptto take generous views in such circumstances.(2)   It also seems clear that a Supply Department, howeverwell-intentioned, aannot be fully informed, as it is&quot;the business of the Ministry of Labour, as theDepartment expert in labour matter^,to be, on suahquestions as the wages and labour conditions prevailingbefore the war, the real increase in the oost of livingduring the war,&apos; the inter-action of rates of wages inthe various industries, the probable attitude of theseveral interests likely to be affected.by particularincreases, and the effects of such increases on theinterest of other contracting or labour-ercploying -departments, and on the labour position.us a whole andwill bo liable to pay insufficient attention to theseconsiderations.   There is, thereforo. a grave riskthat the Supply Department dealing with a particulartrade &amp;ay, through ignorance or indifference, givefar-reaching decisions which prejudicially affect theinterests of other Departments, and tend to raiseoontr&amp;ot prices generally.   Instances of this kind, asis well known, have actually oocurred in the past.,
r oJO8,     It may no doubt &quot;be argued that the Ministry of Labouris in no better position than the V/ar Office as regards thelegal power of preventing such agreements from taking effect, but,although this may be technically true, it is nevertheless theoase that the Ministry of Labour is,^ in virute &quot;of itsconstitution and functions, more favourably situated than anordinary Supply Department for bringing persuasion&apos;&apos;, or pressure tobear on organised labour,   partiyula.*ly wjiarv. as is nearlyalways the case, the industry concerned is one in which severalSupply Departments are more or less interested; and apart fromthis, it would appear to be obviously fitting that the Ministryshould act as the mouthpiece of the general policy of theGovernment on labour matters.   Moreover, there are cases inwhich the Ministry has actually exercised this function ofdisapproving agreements, as in the case eeg,, of the buildingtrade where (before the promulgation of the recent Order for the,regulation of wages in this trade) the Minister, on the adviceof the Building Executive Committee presided over by Sir GeorgeAskwith, refused to sanction certain proposed wages advances inthe Liverpool district   which had not onljrr!!been agreed uponbetween the local representative bodies of employers and employedbut had also been oonfirmed by the recognised conciliationmachinery of the trade.   This precedent appears to show that theMinistry does not rigidly adhere to the principle that it hasno locus standi except in eases of actual differences betweenparties; and it appears desirable that it should adopt asimilar attitude in regard to tollusive agreements in othertrades,S,    It is realised that the Ministry as in some sensespecially responsible for protecting the interests of labour,may feel some reluctance to express disapproval of an agreementwhich has been arrived at between employers and workmen; butth*.s reluctance is fo^t just as strongly by a Departmentresponsible for supply, on account of the prejudicial effectwhich such an attitude ia likely to have *n output and en itsrelations with the trade concerned.   On the other hand, unlesssom authority will assume the responsibility of taking astrong line there is no limit to the increased expenditure whichmay be imposed on the taxpayer by collusive advances of wages.That the position from this point of view ie fully appreciatedby the Ministry of Labour is shown by the following extractfrom its Labour Report for the week ending tho 3rd July, whichstates the case very clearly:-&quot;The oontrol of labour nor falls entirely on theGovernment, which has for this purnosc practically replaced i.the employers, Hiose resistance to wage demands is weakened bythe certainty of reimbursement, and in a crisis the positionis bound to.be conditioned by the demands of the SupplyDepartments which oannot afford to see any reduction in theprogramme Of out-turn.   The prospectB of the future are soserious that a definite stand against outrageous demands isrequired, whatever the effects of that stand may prove to be.rt10 It appears to the War Office that the most practicalmethod of improving the present unsatisfactory situation inregard to the indirect labour matter is to be found along thefolloving lines:*(l)   To extend to as many as possible of tho importanttrades the Bystora. governing wages in the EngineeringIndustry, abolishing sporadic and local increases asfar as possible, and providing for the settlementand
and periodical revision of wages rates on well-definedprinciples by the Committee of Production or otherGovernment arbitrator,(ii)   To   entrust the consideration of minor adjustments ofrates, inequalities within an industry, etc., to one ormore interdepartmental Committees on the model of theBuilding Labour Committee and the Building ExecutiveCommittee, which would advise the Minister of Labour asto the deaioion to be given in such cases, and wouldalso consider and if necessary refer to the Committeeon Production, Jarger questions and general advancesaffecting industries to which the system referred to. under (l) had not yet been extended..   The moreimportant Purchasing Departments would all berepresented on these Committees, and where the industryaffected by a proposed advance was mainly controlled bya particular Department supplemental ad hocrepresentation for that department could be arranged,(iii)   The policy of not recognising wages advances other thanthose approved under (i) or (ii) to be definitelyadopted and rnnounced by the Government and ordersprohibiting such unauthorised advances to be made ifnecessary under the Munitions of War Acts, as ha3recently been done in the *ase of the building trade.MUTER,26th October, 1918.
