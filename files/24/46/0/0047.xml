THE&apos;  RUSSIAN  SITUATION.                      Memorandum &quot;by Lord Ourgon.        7/hile great events are happening in Prance, we seem to he insome danger of losing sight of what is going to Jiappen in Russia.        It is difficult to keep pace with all the telegrams, hut thefollowing appears to he the situation:-        On tho one hand, we have.Mr. Lockhart at Moscow acting in theclosest collaboration with Trotsky and repeating to us daily with incre;ing passion the Trotzky formulas of        (a) Creation of a new Russian revolutionary army        fb) Allied assistance in this undertaking        (o) No Allied or Japanese intervention at ITladivostock        (d) No Allied or British intervention at Murmansk or archangel,        This, it is true, is a policy, but so far at any rate it hasnot got beyond the region of declamation.        As against this, we know that there is no Russian Army becauseit has disappeared: and that there is not likely to be any new Russianarmy because&quot;no one means to fight.  The majority ox our advisers.tellus that to hope to create a new State or ? new Army in Russia cut ofthe shattered&quot;debris hf Bolshevism is a fantastic dream.        Heanwhile we have General Poole advising the occupation ofMurmansk and archangel.  T.7e find opinion even among Russians (M.Maklakoff himself is&apos; a convert) veering round in the direction of Japan-ese intervention in Siberia.  But there seems to be a general consensusthat if this takes place, it should be, not as an independent movement,or a movement made at the request or with the consent of the allies,but a step taken with their actual and visible co-operation.  HithertoJapan is believed to have refused this condition.  -Jill she persist inthat attitude?  It is the sole policy which America seems at all likelyto favour.        Ought we not to decide between the two policies?  To believe inone, while we pursue the other,  or to believe in neither, but to pursueboth, seems equally to lead to destruction.                                             (Intd.) 0. of K,26t^jfcgch 1918.  ^
