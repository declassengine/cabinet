This Document is the Property of,T1198j JoustsHis Britannic Majesty^ Government.)CONTROL OF REFRIGERATED MEATi&amp;smmm BY ALLIED MARITIME TRANSPORT COUNCILAND MINISTRY OF SHIPPING         It is observed that the future arrangements with regardto the control of refrigerated meat (C-.T.3958 and connecteddocuments) are under consideration by the Cabinet.The Allied Maritime Transport Council and the Ministry ofShipping are of course not concerned with the details of thearguments contained in the papers referred to.   It is, however,desirable that their general point of view should be before theCabinet in connection with the general question.relating to the creation of the Council provide that the Councilshall obtain and review statements of the import requirements ofthe different Allies and shall recommend to the respective Govern-ments an allocation of available tonnage in accordance therewithdesigned to secure that the cargoes carried shall be such as toconduce most effectively to the prosecution of the war.  For thispurpose it was contemplated that the different supply programmesshould, before going to the Council itself, be subject to Inter-Allied criticism by means of Executives formed (with such variationsas might be necessary^ upon the model of the Wheat Executive.refrigerated tonnage on the one hand and ordinary cargo vessels  onthe other, and the Council at their meeting of last week definitelydecided that meat and refrigerated tonnage came within their scope.different Executives and the question as to the method in whicheffective Inter-Allied criticism can best be obtained for each classof commodities are now under careful examination.         In the meantime,  however,  the Council think it well  tostate that they are definitely interested in the establishment of                                                              such/The decisions at the Paris Conference of December 1917The Paris decisions make no distinction between meat andThe exact relations of the Council and its staff to the
 such a system as  will secure  in the  case  of refrigerated produce and meat  as  well  as  other commodities an  effective  Inter-Allied criticism of requirements of  the Allies as a whole  and a proper co-ordination and interchangeability between the programmes both of the different  Allies and of military and civilian importations.          So  far as the Ministry of Shipping is concerned their interest  is  simply that there should be such arrangements on the supply side  as will  (a) enable the Ministry to programme vessels on such routes (i.e. the nearest) as will secure the maximum importing capacity for the vessels in question, and (b) for this purpose se6Ure such co-ordination both of military  and civilian requirements and  of  the requirements of all the Allies, so far as they entail  demands  upon British tonnage, as will leave the Ministry  free to  act in accordance with the above principle. That is the  Ministry desires  to be able to send at  any moment the largest proportion of the available  meat  tonnage to the nearest source of supply, (the limiting factor being the amount of      - *- r refrigerated produce and meat available as a whole  from that source of supply  whether it is military or civilian) and to deliver the  cargo by any vessel in satisfaction of  the most urgent demand.   This means in short such co-ordination of the Supply Departments as will enable the demands to be made as a whole upon the Ministry of Shipping and ?rill secure the inter- changeability of  cargo as between the different consuming countries and Departments as  -?nay be  necessary.          Subject  to these two principles  being secured, the detailed organisation adopted is of course a matter for the  Supply Depart- ments in  which the Ministry of Shipping is not directly concerned,26 MAR 1918
