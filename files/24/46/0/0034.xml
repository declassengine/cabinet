At the present time in considering the situationin Russia the question of most vital importance is todecide definitely upon the future Allied Policy as regardsthat Country.        The result of the Allied Policy adopted during thepast 6 months has resulted in a complete diplomatic triumphfor Germany.    At the present moment Germany has  acquiredcomplete domination over the Ukraine and the BalticProvinces - in fact over all the Ye stern District  ofEuropean Russia without any military opposition 7/hatever.Towns like Pskoff, Dvinsk, etc, ?/ere taken fcy a fewCavalry or Cyclists,  without the slightest trouble and-probably without a single casualty        Owing -to the  manner in 7/hich Germany has developedher diplomatic Policy since the first Revolution,  herMilitary Forces are now welcomed everywhere in Hussia,except by the few Hooligans and anarchists, as &quot;SAVIOURS&quot;&apos;rather than as &quot;CONQUERORSThis naturally places  Germanyon a very sound basis for establishing her influence  anddomination in all commercial and other matters in  WesternRussia, especially as the evacuation of the Allied Embassiesfrom Petrograd has removed the slight influence v/hich mighthave been exerted against her.        Various reports have been made on the  futility  ofbolstering up Russian Political movements  - such as,  theFrench policy in the  Ukraine, the Alexieff movement  inthe Don, etoc, etc,   All these were doomed to failure  fromthe outset, as outside force must be brought in to makeany
-2-any Russian soldier  (Officer or Man) fight against Bolshevismand Anarchism * which  are now practically the same thing -or still more against the Germans.        In this report It is not proposed to discuss thepast policy, which can only he described as disastrous, butto put forward a concrete proposal for the present andimmediate future to counteract the German domination andits further growth.        It is rumoured that the Japanese intend to land   1at Vladivostock to restore order there and in Manchuria.If this is true, it is undoubtedly an excellent step asfar as it goes, and will tend to uohold Allied - especiallyJapanese - influence in the Far tf.ast.     Much more, however,is necessary and it is essential that Allied, particularlyBritish and French, influence should be brought to bear InWestern Russia.   This influence can only be effective whenit has force behind it and consequently its introduction canonly be effected from the North through the Ports ofMurmansk and Archangel.        Judging from what we have seen of the occupation ofthe Western Provinces of European Russia by the Germans, itwould only be necessary to employ a small force to carry outsuch a policy.   The Bolshevik Troops are thoroughlyundisciplined and disorganised and are quite unfit to Opposeany small body of Regular Troops.        Further it is certain that any display of an activepolicy on the part of the Allies would be welcomed by thegreat majority of the people of all classes in NorthernRussia, and a local Militia or Police force could be formed,Various proposals have been put forward for the formation of .a Volunteer Army from the so-called patriotic Russians,  butpersonally I have no faith whatever In any of these proposalswithout an outside fores behind them.   No Russian Officers                                                         or
 or Men can be relied upon to show any $nergy or fight for : any cause on their own initiative.        The formation of local Militia or Police must be carried out under the direct orders and control of Allied Officers and N.C.0s., and there need be no false sentiment expressed that such a policy would incite animosity amongst the Russians.   They know now only too well their entire lack of organising capacity.        There is one most important point to be considered in connection with&quot; any actions, having military force behind them, which may he carried out anywhere in Russia - namely that all such actions must be executed on a common andwell-defined programme, definitely agreed upon beforehandby ail the Allies and widely published throughout the whole Country.    It is essential to emphasize that such actions are only being taken by the Allies for        (1)  Restoration of law and order in Russia.        (2)  Counter-Action against a complete domination             of all Russia by Germany i.e. the restoration             of Russia far the Russian People.        (3)  Energetic action to save the Russian People from             the famine which now undoubtedly threatens  them.        It would appear to be very necessary that allmilitary actions should be undertaken jointly by the  Allies, and it is suggested that this could be effected in the mostpractical manner as follows:-&apos;Far Fast... Siberia.   American military force should          accompany and co-operate with the Japanese.  mhe          British and French should each send a military          mission to accompany the same. Northern European Russia.  Joint military forces from Great-         Britain and France under the supreme command of          the British.   This latter is essential for          co-operation with the j;aval forces at the Ports,          in which presumably the British will preponderate.          American and Japanese military missions  could  be          attached to this force.                                                    It
                      -4-         It  is  not  considered  necessary  in view  of the  small forces which will  be  required,  to  have  military missions from Italy or Belgium.   If  necessary for diplomatic reasons, one Military Attache could  be  sent  with each force  from these two countries.         It  is  proposed  that the programme for the common    v use of all  Allied military forces  in Russia should be broadly  on  the following lines:-         (a)  Establishment of the  Constituent Assembly             with universal and equal franchise.         (b)  Restoration of all local Authorities generally             as arranged by the late Provisional Government.         (c)  Temporary  and later permanent representation             of all parties who stand for the Constituent             Assembly.         (d)  A federative Russia.         (e)  Disarmament of all persons not officially             attached to recognised local Militia or             Police units.         (f)  Restoration of Discipline on revised military             laws for Officers and Men.        Such a programme is essential and must be widelypublished to prevent the obvious propaganda,  instigated byGerman Agents,  against the  Allies that they are  merely comingin to annex parts of Russia for themselves.        Amongst other immediate advantages  which wouldaccrue from this  policy would  be         (A)   The  safety to  the Allies  of the vast  quantities             of stores of  all  kinds at the  Ports of             Vladivostock  and  Archangel, and  the orevention             of their acquisition by  the Germans or  illicit             use  by the Russians.         (B)   The  guarantee  of  repayment  of  the hugh  debt             owed by Russia to the  Allied Countries.  1         (C)   The  safety of  Allied Commercial undertakings             already existing  in Russia.                                                Referring
         Referring back to  the proposal for Allied action inNorthern Russia, the  following generally &quot;Outlines the policyproposed: -         At each of the Ports of Murmansk and Archangel, a Navalforce  of two  or three ships should be established, and a smallland force for occupation  of the Railway Lines:-          :         (a) down to Petrozavodsk from Murmansk..         (b) down to Vologda from Archangel.This would afford complete domination and influence overNorthern Russia and would  effect a junction with the Trans-Siberian Railway at Vologda, which is very necessary for thetransit  of foodstuffs from Siberia to Northern Russia.         The only possible  opposition that could be met wouldbe at the Ports from the Russian Naval Units, but the entirelack of  discipline and the disorder of the past 8 monthseffectively reduces their fighting capacity to a minimum.It is very doubtful if any opposition whatsoever would beencountered.    The G-erman Forces may possibly enter and policePetrograd to break up the Headquarters and centre of Bolshevism,but it is unlikely that they will penetrate further North  orEast.        Secrecy is, of course,  essential as regards  the  arrival &apos;of the Allied Forces  at the Ports,  but immediately after their  .arrival, the programme of policy should be  widely published.This can be arranged  beforehand through known and reliableAgents to a great  extent.Position in Southern  Russia.   The above deals with the pro-posals for the Far East and Northern Russia,  but  there doesnot appear at present to be any practical means  of introducingAllied influence with military  force  behind it,  in Central orSouthern Russia.    However, it  Is essential that  a strongpolitical and commercial organisation should  be  established                                                  in
        in Southern Russia to counteract the commercial domination by        the Central Powers in that district and in the territory  towards        Persia and India.  Such an organisation should be  formed  at once        and be sent to Headquarters  at say Tiflis by the best  available        route *                This organisation would then be in a position  to  co-op-        erate with the Central Organisation of Russia, which should        accompany the Allied Force through the Northern Ports,                Similarly, a political and commercial organisation        should enter Siberia with the Allied Force through Vladivostock -        again to co-operate with the Central Organisation,                Proposals for the formation of the Central Organisation        for commercial and all other matters In Russia are ^iven  in        the attached report.                When order is restored, the controlling factor on the        whole future of Russia must  be &quot;Finance&quot;  from outside, and  conse-        quently it is of the greatest importance  to establish the necess-        ary Commercial organisations which must be ready to  act at  once        when the opportunity to do so arrives.   Unless some  such  policy        as that outlined above is adopted  and energetically  carried  out,        Germany will be in the field first and alone,  and Great Britain        will be again &quot;Too Late&quot;  to  collect a fair share of  the best of        the Commercial Undertakings  which  will be  open for Development.  .     Further the execution of  such a policy will be very  effective        during the duration of the V-ar in  checking the wlthdra?ral of        Supplies from Russia to Germany and Austria.
