rThl ^Docjir^?rfc m  the Proper! ys  Britannic  Majesty&apos;3 Cover,&quot;.221IIColonel Janesirs  Aims   and   Objects.HTOHE COMMERCIAL COMMITTEE, HOUSE  OF COMMONS,BYThe Right Hon. G. N.  BARNES,  M.P.,THURSDAY, MARCH 20,  7918. Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen: My appearance amongst you hereo-night arises out of an address that I gave a few weeks ago on&apos; Labour and the War.&apos;&apos;  To-night you have been good enough to askae to speak on &quot;Labour: Its Aims and Objects.&quot;  I think welight try to forget about the war for a while, which will be a greatelief, and I would suggest that we also banish from our minds, so r as we  can, the abnormal wages and conditions which are due toxceptional war causes.  I would ask you just to throw back yourrinds to  the times and conditions before the war,  say,  five yearsgo, and when I speak of existing conditions I shall have those inIV mind.  They were conditions which, as you know, were not at11 satisfactory, which were admittedly bad, but they were condi-ons which may reappear after the war unless wise provision is madegainst their reappearance. And it is in the hope that I may be able, ever so little, to contribute to that provision that I venture toddress you to-night.
  Now the subject is a very large one, and if it were considered fromthe point of view of ultimate aims and objects of Labour, it wouldlead us, I am.afraid,  into very deep and troubled waters.  There isthe Socialist view, which would altogether eliminate private, profitsfrom  industry as the  means of attaining  Labours ultimate endsThere is the Syndicalist view, which would put industries under thecontrol  of those who operate them.  - Even  Anarchism  lias itsadherents, and always had.  Robert Burns, in his &quot; Jollv Bet&quot;*ars &quot;says:                &quot;A fig for those by law protected,                Liberty&apos;s a glorious feast.&quot;  The feast, by the by,  is not so very  enticing  just now, as spreadbefore us in Russia; but we  should be wise not to harden our heartsbecause  of that.  We should  look with sympathy  upon all move-ments which are intended to extend the borders of human freedom.I do not want, however,  to lead  myself into speculations  aboutultimates further than to say this I  am perfectly sure  that eol-lectivist  principles will more and more be applied to modern socialand industrial problems.  Just how  far they may be applied, andin what way collectivist control may  be harmonised with individualliberty, is a thing we may safely leave to those who will  follow afterwe  are dead.  What we have got to do, it seems to me, in a demo-eratic country is to ascertain and be guided by,  to a large extent,the feelings  and sentiments operating  in the mind  of the averageman  and woman of our own  day and generation.                     THE PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS.  Looking at the matter from  that practical point of view, I shouldsay that Labour&apos;s aims and objects  are twofold.  First of all, theaverage man wants more of  the good things of life, and he wants aman&apos;s place in the industrial order instead of being a mere cog in thewheel. (Hear, hear.)  There, it seems to me, you have the problem.We have got to get it firmly fixed in our minds, in the first place,that the  average worker of to-day is a different sort of person to theaverage worker of 40 or 50 years ago.  It was Robert Low, I think,who  said; on the passing of the 1867 Franchise Act, that we mustnow educate our masters.  The education of masters began in 1870-or,  at least, the Education Acts were passed in  1870 and you havehad a process of education going on ever since, and the question thatI think all practical politicians now ought to put to themselves is:&apos;&apos; Has the State raised a higher standard of citizenship and failed togive proper scope for its activity? &quot;  (Hear, hear.)  I believe it has.  Just let us consider the man of 40 or  50  years  ago.   I am oldenough to  remember  him; I have worked with him, and  I canremember the man at that time very well.  He was comparativelyan  illiterate man, and even  if he read at all, philosophical thoughtwas not  popularised as it is  now,  when you can buy John Ruskhrsworks for Is.  The man at  that timfe  had few  needs.   He did not
FEEL OUT OF PLACE IN A POSITION OF SUBORDINATION; IN FACT, HE TOOK THATPOSITION OF SUBORDINATION AS  A MATTER OF COURSE AS IN  THE  NATURALORDER OF THINGS.  THEREFORE, YOU HAD, AS I SAY, A DIFFERENT KIND OF MANALTOGETHER AT THAT TIME,  COMPARED WITH THE MAN THAT WE HAVE GOTTO DEAL WITH TO-DAY.   IN SHORT, THE MAN AT THAT TIME WAS THE PRODUCTOF GENERATIONS OF IGNORANCE AND NEGLECT.  BUT THERE  WAS  ANOTHER THING.   EVEN  THEN THE  MAN  HAD  ACHANCE OF PUTTING HIS OAR IN AND HAVING A VOICE IN THE MANAGEMENTOF EVERYDAY AFFAIRS A CHANCE WHICH IS DENIED, TO A LARGE EXTENT, HIS-ACCESSOR BECAUSE, AS YOU KNOW, INDUSTRY WAS THEN IN A PRIMITIVESTATE AS COMPARED WITH NOW.   WORKSHOPS WERE  SMALL, AND IF A MANHAD A GRIEVANCE HE PUT IT TO HIS EMPLOYERS, AND IT WAS SETTLED EITHER11 ONE WAY  OR ANOTHER; WHEREAS, AS YOU ALL KNOW, WORKSHOPS ARE NOWARGE, AND ARE OFTEN  CONTROLLED FROM A CENTRE.  VICKERS&apos;, FOR INSTANCE,I  SUPPOSE MAY EMPLOY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS  OF MEN, AND  IT  ISAFFILIATED WITH AN ORGANISATION OF EMPLOYERS SOME OF WHOM ARE ALMOSTAS LARGE. THEREFORE, THE MAN OF TO-DAY,  IF HE HAS  A GRIEVANCE ANDHE HAS HAS TO PUT  IT TO  SOMEBODY WHO SENDS IT ALONG TO SOMEBODYELSE, WHO IN TURN PASSES IT ALONG TO SOMEONE ELSE, AND IN THE  PROCESSOF TRANSMISSION TIME IS LOST AND THE MAN&apos;S GRIEVANCE IS VERY  OFTENUNRECTIFIED.  IT IS JUST THE SAME ON THE SIDE OF THE MAN&apos;S OWN ORGANISATION ONTHE LABOUR SIDE.  FORTY OR 50 YEARS AGO THE MAN HAD HIS LOCAL CLUB.NOW HIS LOCAL CLUB HAS BECOME THE BRANCH OF A CENTRAL ORGANISATION,WITH ITS HEADQUARTERS EITHER IN LONDON OR SOMEWHERE ELSE, AND TO-DAYTHE MAN IN GLASGOW, OR MANCHESTER, OR NEWCASTLE, OR SOME  OTHERPLACE, AS THE CASE MAY BE, FEELS THAT THERE IS FAR TOO MUCH BEING DONEIN LONDON ; IN FACT,  HE THINKS HE IS BEING &quot; DONE &quot; IN LONDON, AND HEWOULD LIKE  TO  BE DOING SOMETHING MORE  FOR HIMSELF.  SIMILARLY, IN REGARD TO  WAGES, THE MAN FEELS TO-DAY THAT HIS LABOURIS MORE PRODUCTIVE.   HE KNOWS THAT HE IS PRODUCING  MORE WEALTHTO-DAY THAN HIS FATHER AND HIS  GRANDFATHER DID;  THAT SCIENCE, ASAPPLIED, TO INDUSTRY, IS ALWAYS EXTENDING HER BORDERS, AND THAT, AS ACONSEQUENCE, THE WEALTH OF THE COMMUNITY HAS INCREASED,  AND HEFEELS THAT HIS SHARE OF IT HAS NOT BEEN SO LARGE AS IT OUGHT  TO HAVEBEEN.  HE IS STILL TIED DOWN TO HIS DAILY TOIL, AND IF WAGES ARE LARGER(WHICH WE MUST, OF  COURSE, ADMIT) AT THE SAME TIME YOU MUST ADMITALSO THAT THE MAN HAS  NOT A SUFFICIENTLY LARGE WAGE TO ADMIT OF HIMHAVING A HOLIDAY WHEN HE WANTS ONE, OR MEETING THE ORDINARY  NEEDSOF  AN EDUCATED PERSON,  OR OF EVEN SUPPLYING HIS FAMILY WITH THECHANCES THAT A FAMILY SHOULD HAVE IN AN EDUCATED AND ENLIGHTENEDCOMMUNITY.  THE QUESTION ARISES:  &quot; WHAT  CAN  WE  DO TO IMPROVE  THE POSITIONAND GIVE SATISFACTION TO  THE  WORKER? &quot;  WE HAVE MET TOGETHER ASPOLITICIANS, AND YOU COMMERCIAL MEN, I TAKE IT,  WANT TO KNOW FROMME WHAT IS IN THE MIND OF THE AVERAGE  WORKER  TO-DAY; WHAT HE IS
thinking of;  and how it. is that he feels himself to be a misfit in hispresent social  and industrial environment.  When I say ive I am,for the moment, taking  with you a detached view  of the thin&quot;although, as you know, I am a  member of the Labour Party, andam myself of labour, by  origin,  association, and sympathy.  Whatcan we do to help him ?                           SELF-HELP.  First of all, just let us glance for a  moment to see what he isdoing  to  help  himself.   His   efforts  lie  mainly in  two  direc-tions by  Trade  Unionism and  by  Co-operation.   I  think  Iami right in  saying that about four millions of the most intelligentof the working-class population  of this country are enrolled in oneor other of  these  two movements.   There are many  who belongto both.   Trade Unionism  accepts the  existing industrial andeconomic order of things, but tries to make the  best of it by collectivebargaining.  It seeks  to  get for its  members  better  conditions oflife by complete organisation and  by the utilisation of the skill ofits officers  and experts generally.   I think I may say it has improvedthe condition of Labour very considerably.  The co-operative movement, on the other hand, is more funda-mental.  It seeks to substitute collective for individual ownership ofthe means of life, of industry, and of commerce.  Primarily, it is acommunity of consumers, who find the capital, but who fix the rateox return of that capital at a certain limited amount now generally4-g per cent, for purposes of simplicity and then the surplus, if any,is credited to the purchasers, at market rates,  and is used as capitalto extend operations to the field  of production  and supply.   I thinkI may say that there,  again, the co-operative  movement has donea great deal towards raising the conditions of Labour throughoutthe country.  It remains to be seen what we can do.                         MOJJE  LEISUKE.  What can  politicians do to improve the conditions?  I should saythat, first of  all, we can get more  leisure for workmen by encouraginga system of shorter hours of work and a better industrial organisationgenerally. That can be done. There may be shorter hours of labour-with more intensity of work, of course without in any way injuringanybody.   You can have shorter boms  of labour with  benefit notonly- to the workman, but to everybody  concerned.  (Hear,  hear.)That has been proved over and over and over again by employers oflabour throughout the length and breadth of this country; and yet,although that is so, the workman has been compelled to go to workat 6  o &quot;clock  in the morning before the streets were  aired (hear.hear) to start work under conditions that he knows are not at allproductive (hear,  hear) to start  work  at a very early7  bom- in themorning  in the cold, and  under circumstances of a general lack of
organisation, before his principals arrive to start  work under con-ditions that he knows are.quite unnecessary, and which  have beenproved by many employers of labour to be unnecessary.   Therefore,in the first  place, I think we,  as politicians,  and in so far  as wecan guide and control industry as men in that capacity,  might do aaood deal for Labour  by  encouraging  shorter hours. We can do ain-eat  deal in that  respect as  politicians,  because, after all, theGovernment is getting a larger customer for manufactures.  TheGovernment is always getting a larger purchaser  of goods, and  itdoes seem to me that a great deal might be done by the Governmentto get its goods produced, we will say,  on an eight-hour system, thesame as in the Government  workshops at Woolwich, at Portsmouth,and elsewhere, and by that  means we  should be assisting Labour toget more leisure.  (Hear, hear.)  Then there are also other things that we might do in  the samedirection.   The  Government will  remain  in  control of  railways,mines, and  other  enterprises.   The  hours  of  labour  should  beshortened on all of them.                        A NEW SPIRIT.  In the second  place, we  could do a great deal in the  way of animproved organisation which would  give  the workman  a greaterinterest in his work and make him feel that he was really a humanfactor in the business.  In that way something  has already beendone by profit-sharing, and where profit-sharing  has been startedwith a sincere desire to sweeten  the relationships between employersand workmen,  and, generally speaking, to  &quot; stoke up &quot;  everybodywith a view to everybody&apos;s betterment, a great  deal  of good hasresulted.  But, unfortunately, it has weakned Trade Unions in manycases by detaching groups of workers from those Trade Unions.  Infact, I know it has sometimes been started with that object in view,as in the case of  the South Metropolitan Gasworks  many  years ago.Therefore, it- ds suspect in the  minds of the average: worker&apos;. For mypart, I believe now that Trade  Unions are more firmly establishedthan ever before, and that these questions are being approached in abroader spirit than previously at  least one can say the  danger ofweakening Trade Unionism by  profit-sharing is far less now thanever it was before.   (Hear, hear.)  Then there are other methods of getting the workman interestedin his work,  and the most common one is that of working by paymentby results by piecework.  That has also been open to abuse.  Insome cases  employers of labour have  cut  piece rates so that theworkman working on piece  rates has  little satisfaction,  except thesatisfaction  of working harder  and getting very little  for it.  Formy  part,  I  believe  in  piecework  as  a  principle where   it  isapplicable.  (Hear,  hear.)  Therefore,  I regret  very  much thatpiecework  has been  in  times  gone  by  discredited.   But  there
is  the  fact;  it  has  been discredited.  Prices  have  been  cutuntil  the  man  has  got  very  little  for  his hard  work.  Hehas put his head  into his work,  his; heart into his  work then hehas found that the prices have been cut repeatedly;  so much so thatafter working very hard on piece rates he finds he has earned a sumonly equal to that of a day worker.  I do not say it is the same inevery case.  In  some cases Trade Unions have been strong enoughto maintain prices.  In cases such as coal prices are fixed  fairly wellIn cases  such as  cotton  the  prices  have been  fixed by  expertsemployed byr the employers, on  the  one side, and the workmen uponthe other.  Why could not the Government appoint and pay piecerates or price-fixers ?  I believe that that would have a good effectYou take a man and put him in a position of independence, both ofemployers  and workmen,  and  by  that  means he would  have nointerest except  in  fixing prices fair and square.   For my  part Ibelieve it  will come to that before we have done with the pieceworlsy-stem.  Piecework  rates  are  quite  simple  in  some  cases,  such acoal and  cotton,  and  where work is of a  repetition  characterbut when you come  to engineering, or  those  industries that  vanfrom day to day,  you should have somebody then,  I believe,  paidby  an  independent  authority-.  At  all events,  by these  meanyou  would get men  continuing  to  work   at  piecework rateinstead of day- work rates.   You  would get men interested inthe work, and,  therefore,  you would get men turning out moregoods,  making,  as I belive, a  more  wealthy community, and byturning out more  goods, cheapening the prices of goods;  becauseafter all,  the more goods you have the cheaper they are,  and thatcould be done without any organic  difference at all in the industriaorder of to-day.   (Hear,  hear.)  I am also in favour of extendingthe operation of the Trade Boards Act, because it has been found fcbe a great success already. It  has done away with the scandalof  Cradley Heath that we  used  to hear about.  Similar legislatioihas brought the agricultural labourers  wage  up to a minimum o25s.  a week, and as much more as he can get.  I should be disposeto  extend the Trade Boards Act to  bring in shopkeepers  or anybodelse who might come  in at the lower end of the industrial scale, anthus  improve   their  position  and encourage them  to  organisthemselves for still further improvement.                        WHITLEY REPORT.  Then,  thirdly, there  is the question of more co-operation in tliworkshop. In that respect, I believe  that the Whitley  Report hilaid down a principle which will yet have far-reaching and benefieieffects.  (Hear, hear.)  That principle may; be briefly described i&quot; Constitutions  for Industries.&quot;  It gives effect to the same princip
which,  in the realm of polities we have applied to our Dominions.The Dominions have Home Rule,  except  in regard to treaties anddefence and that sort of thing; but subject to that they can paddletheir own canoe.  Even the black man has a right to a voice in theprovincial Parliaments in the last we set up in South Africa.   Whyshould not we give the white man here at home a voice in fixing theconditions under which  he  shall carry on  his daily life?  That, itseems to  me,  is a principle that ought to guide us in the betterparrying on of industry.  Employers would still make contracts;still buy raw material  and finished goods; would still equip  theirworkshops exactly as to-day; but,  in  all those things having to. dowith the conditions of labour and the adjustment of those difficultieswhich must inevitably arise from day to day, it seems to me thatthe workman ought to be brought in,  and  has a right to be broughtin.  Time lias  gone, or is going, when industry should be split upinto two  hostile  camps-(hear, hear) each taking as much  fromand giving as little to the pool  as possible.  I believe that neither ofthem gain by  it.  An employer  of labour who pays less  than thestandard rate of  wages  loses by  defective  organisation as  much ashe gains by the reduced wages.  (Hear, hear.)   The man who plays&quot; ca&apos;canny&quot; cannot escape moral  deterioration or have  a  reallive interest in his work.  Therefore I am in favour of anything whichwill increase the mans  interest in his work and bring him and theemployer  more into human touch one  with another.  I should like to see  wages, hours of labour, workshop sanitation,and as many other things as can be  justified from experience broughtin and standardised,  so to speak-standardised  up to  a  decentPlimsoll mark  of individual life,  and then  both  sides encouraged tobring about by some overhead  collective bonus, or  something ofthat sort,  a condition  of  things under  which  everyone  would beencouraged to  do his  best, and  encouraged to  see that everybodyelse  did  his  best.    (Hear,  hear.)  But  it  is  in  the  veryessence of things that there should be a minimum of Governmentinterference and  control (hear, hear) and also that the  outputshould  not be  obtruded as  the  main  consideration.  Employersand  workmen  should  be brought  together in  a  spirit of goodwillwith a view to human betterment.  The devising of such schemes isthe business of these Industrial Councils that are now being set up,where employers and workmen are agreed upon the principle.   Myfriend  Mr. George Roberts,  the  Minister  of  Labour,  who ispresent, is busily engaged in forming these Industrial Councils whereemployers and workmen have agreed upon  the principle.  But there is one step that I think might be taken now  any  way,and that is the  formation of some sort of committee or  shopstewards call  them what you will in the shops, with a view toadjusting,  or helping to adjust,  those industrial difficulties whichinevitably arise from day to day in the woi*ksbop.  I believe that can
be done  anyway.   Unfortunately,  in  some  cases, they have beenregarded with suspicion by  organisations of employers and work-men.   I  do  not  blame  the  employers  any  more  than  theworkmen.   I  know that these  committees  have been  looked atwith  suspicion  by Dotn sides, but I hope  now  that both  sideswill  revise  their views  and  alter their attitude;  because  I feelconvinced that those committees or shop stewards have sometimesassumed a sinister  aspect on account of employers&apos; and workmen&apos;sopposition ;  whereas, if they were  honestly  met and made use ofas I think they might be, you would find that their activities wouldbe constructive rather than destructive.EDUCATION.  Now I come to my fourth point.  I get away from the industrialand now come to the matter of the non-industrial aspect.  I believethat in that aspect of the thing the workman wants more than anything else improved educational facilities and protection of child-lifeagainst exploitation for profit (hear, hear) the two things being sociosely allied  as to  be practically one.  The workman  has now got Ienough education to feel the need for more for his children.  (Hear.hear).  I said a little while ago that education began away back in1870,  but a lot has taken place since then, and  the workman feelsthat, although the education which his child gets now is better thanhe got, yet it is not such  as it ought to be to give the child a fair andsquare start in life.   I believe the average workman feels to-day thatthe start in life and the fair and square-dealing life :that he wantsfor his boy  and  for his  girl,  can only  be obtained in so far Ias  that  boy  or girl has  a robust body  and  a trained  mind. I(Hear, hear.)  That  is what the workman wants.  Many children!are employed  in profit-making industry before 14 years  of age; and Imany, as you know, are  employed now after 14 in arduous work&quot;,  llshould say that the chief defect of our educational system to-day islthat break that sudden break at 14,  when the boy must  leave!school at least he dors leave school that break between educationland work.  (Hear, hear.)  That is to say, the boy leaves school at 141years of age before he has had time to appreciate the value of educa-ltion.  (Hear,  hear.)   Then he goes into work, and he is absorbed inlwork, and cannot think of education.  He is absorbed in work just atjthe most plastic time of his life and character.  Therefore, the work-lman,  I should say, wants to have the standards of education raised,]and to have the half-time age raised (hear, hear)-and to have morelprotection for the children than  there has been in the  past againsilbeing employed Jior profit-making at a tender  age.   Fortunately,!there is a chance just now of getting a step in this direction, because.!as you know, there are two  Bills  before the House, one in charge of!Mr. Fisher for England  and Wales,  and another in charge of Mr.lMunro to  apply to Scotland.  The Scottish Bill now raises the age nn
to 15.  No boy or girl in Scotland will, after that Bill becomes law,be able to leave school up to 15.  Mr. Fisher&apos;s Bill makes it optionalup  to 15.  Considerable powers are given to the local authorities inmany other ways.  In fact, it is not too much to say that only theadministrative clauses of Mr. Munro&apos;s Bill  are open to controversy.There is a great deal of controversy going on in  Scotland aboutthem.  Yet so far as the educational and protective provisions of thetwo Bills are concerned, I think it may be said that  there is generalagreement, not only hi the House, but outside, and I  think we shouldo-et both of these Bills passed into law this  year.  But it should notbe only a technical or cramming education  for productive purposes.Increased  production  would  come  with  better training,   as, forinstances,  if ships&apos;  plates were shaped by rules of geometry insteadof rule  of thumb.  But that would be incidental.  What is  wantedis an education which would give a social sense, and an appreciationof the larger things of life.                           HOUSING. The second thing in this non-industrial aspect which occurs to meis housing.  I think it is not too much to say that everybody who haslooked into this question of housing right away from the time of theHousing Commission that I can just remember,  presided over by thePrince  of  Wales everybody who has looked into  housing in thiscountry has been disgusted with the condition of the housing of thepeople.   (Hear, hear.)  I myself have seen weeds growing throughthe floor of the agricultural labourers cottage.  I have seen, I daresay many of you have seen, the rows, in Ayrshire and elsewhere, ofminers&apos;  cottages dirty,  dingy  looking   places small,  withoutaccommodation  for  the  separation  of   the  sexes,  and  merebreeding  places  of  disease,  and,  therefore,  we  ought  to  bedoing something more than we have done  so far in providingbetter houses for the people.   Housing Orders are all right, but,unfortunately, they do not provide houses.  (Hear,  hear.)  I canjust remember the bad old days when jerry  builders built  as theyliked.  I can just visualise now five &quot; lands &quot; of houses they callthem &quot; lands  &quot; in  Scotland great hideous blocks about five or sixstories  high built between two streets, one the Hill Town and theother Eose Bank Street, in Dundee, which is my native town. Thoseblocks,  five or six storeys high,  were so close together that they wereunwholesome and unhealthy, and there they are now even to thisday.  They are 40 or 50 years old, but every  other one of them is nowclosed by order of  the Medical Authority.  Well, gentlemen, I saythat closing orders are all very well, but they do not provide you withbouses, and sometimes they  even make housing more difficult thanit was.   (Hear, hear.)  Closing orders are  all right, but before youclose and deal with the slums it seems to me that you ought to pro-vido  houses for the people who are going to be called out  of thoseslums.   I have seen various &quot; improvements,&quot; so called, not only in
 Scotland, but here in London, time after time, in which no regard has been paid to improved conditions for people removed.  With all the good resolutions that have been passed, and for all that has been done by Commission and inquiry in regard to housing,  except in Ireland little has been done by collective agency in the way of improving the housing conditions of the people, and for my part,  I should like to see the Irish principle applied to England.   (Hear, hear.)  \lthou&quot;h Mr. Field, you have not got Home Rule in Ireland you have been ahead of us in that, and  I should like to see the English taking a leaf out of the Irish book.   I believe that private enterprise, so far as housing is concerned, in our day and  generation is dead.  It was very near being dead before the war, but the war has killed it. You cannot possibly have private enterprise for housing so long as you have got the Kent Restriction Act upon the Statute Book, because you cannot charge a  rent over and  above   the  Bent   Bestriction  Act  level;   that  is  to  say, you cannot  build  houses  on  an economic basis.   (Hear, hear.) Therefore the  question  arises:  What can  be  done  to  build those houses, seeing  that  private enterprise cannot possibly  do it?  You cannot expect a man to build houses  if there is no profit in it so far as  he is  concerned.  I  believe it  has  got to  be done by frankly adopting the principle of State responsibility&quot; for housing.   (Hear, hear.)  I should like to see the authorities, the local  authorities, throughout the length  and breadth of the country made the agents of the State.  I should like to see all arrangements made as between now and  the end of the wrar that  is to say&apos;, the local authoritieshaving made  the proper arrangements with the Treasury, and havingmade  all  the necessary  arrangements to select sites, employ  con-tractors, and get out their statements and send them to the CentralAuthority.   I  should  like  to  see  all  those  arrangements  madewhereby- the  local authorities could be the agents of the State, the State undertaking to make up a large  percentage if not the whole of the difference between the cost of building those  houses  and therent theyr would receive for them, which must be  based, more orless artificially as it would be,  upon the Bent  Bestriction Act.  Ishould like to see all those arrangements  made  before the  end ofthe war, and then builders from the  Army released  first, and those builders started to build hundreds of thousands of houses throughoutthe length and  breadth of the country for the better housing of the working people ; and I feel perfectly sure that that is  one of the mainaims  and objects  that Labour  has  to-day  and  has  had for manyyears.                        UNEMPLOYMENT.  Last, gentlemen, but by no means least, there comes  the questionof such an organisation  of industry  as  to provide against spells ofunemployment,  or, if unemployment has to  come, provision should
                              nbe made to tide over that spell of unemployment for  the workingpeople.  I  can assure you that nothing has so embittered the livesof the working people of this country as going about vainly seekingwork  and  unable to find it.  (Hear, hear.)  Nothing has so farembittered the  life of the honest would-be worker as  going  aboutseeking work  and knowing that his scanty savings were vanishingday by day.  I hope we shall provide against that in the near future.The man feels a sense  of injustice there, just as he does in manyother things.  He feels, for instance, that  he is not being treated thesame as the Army and  the Navy.   Those men are kept when thereis no righting  to be done; they are paid whether  fighting or resting.Tliev are kept fit to fight should  there be  occasion to fight.   Whyshould not the industrial army be served in the same way?  I donot say it could be applied exactly in the same way as in the case oftlie soldier and the sailor; but it should be done in some way orother.  The community ought to feel that the industrial army is animportant, if  not the all-important, element in the life of the  com-munity.  (Hear, hear.)  The industrial army ought to be kept  fit towork when there is work to be done.   Now that  only means  anextension of the principle of insurance which has, to some extent,found a lodgment upon our Statute Book.  If the State had to paywhile  men were out of work there  is this further  consideration, thatthe State  would be more  lively in  creating such  an industrialorganisation as would find work to do instead of having these meneompulsorily idle now and then as they are.  Xow,  Mr. Chairman  and  gentlemen, I must  conclude.  I  havetried to point  out a few of the things that Labour is thinking at thepresent time.   I have tried to indicate what I think is in his  mindas to some of the remedies which I believe, and which he believes,would be of great advantage, not only to him, but to the communitygenerally.   They are  more  leisure, more  pay,  and more  control,more  education, and,  generally speaking, work,  if  he  is willing towork, and  the other matters that I have mentioned.  You will notice I have not said anything about the restoration ofTrade Union  conditions, about which we hear so much, but aboutwhich I am  afraid  some people think so  little.   I have not saidanything about them because I care very little about them.  I lookhack upon them with contempt, as the mere outcome and registra-tion of  petty huckstering  carried on in a spirit of  ill-will  andsuspicion.   (Hear, hear.)   I do not want to return to them.  I donot believe anybody else  in his  sober senses wants to return tothem.  I hope we have outlived them.  But at the same time Labourfought for them, and  is entitled to  a  quid  pro quo.  I believethat Labour   will  be  wise  in   bartering  away  those old  con-ditions in some way  or another, using those  old conditions  asa means by which to set up not only better conditions of labour, butbetter  conditions  of  life   for   everybody (bear,   hear) betterorganisation,  and a  better atmosphere in the workshop and out of
the workshop.  Therefore, I hope that, when the time comes, Labourwill not attach undue importance to those old Trade Union cou-ditions. but  regard them as  something which may be  barteredaway for better conditions. If it is wise it will do that; and not onlywilTit  get its quid pro quo, but a great  deal more than that; that isto say,&quot;if we have all learned the lesson that the war ought to havetaught us, and that lesson is more co-operation between all classesin the community.  (Hear, hear.)  If the war has not taught us that,ii we do not get that in our  minds,  then, good heavens! there is nohealth in us and the outlook is dark indeed.  I believe we have.   Just one last word about  the soldier.  After all, he is  the manwhom  I have in my mind more than any other man.  When I speakof  Labour I include  the soldier.  (Hear, hear.)  Of course, manyof  them  have  gone  and cannot be  recalled, but many of  themremain,  and  will  be coming  back to this  old country,  I  hope,in  a very short time.  They have suffered that we might  be safe.(Hear, hear.)  They have fought that we might be free, and I hope,therefore, that we &quot;shall,  in  our turn,  do something to get for themwhen  they come back a better heritage than they had known in thepast.
