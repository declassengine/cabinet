Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction for Ireland.

FOOD PRODUCTION SCHEMES IRELAND.

Memorandum prepared in compliance with Chief Secretary&apos;s Minute of 17th March, 1917.

Week ended 27th March, 1918.

The following is a brief statement on the work of the Department during the past week in furtherance of increased Food Production in Ireland :-

TILLAGE DEFAULTERS.

Entries under Regulation 2.L. of the Defence of the Realm Regulations, continue to be made by the Department on holdings the occupiers of which were in serious default in respect of the 1917 requirements.

During the week under review the Department instructed their Inspectors to acquire compulsorily ever thirty such holdings in different parts of Ireland, and after entry had been effected conacre auctions were arranged. A total area of approximately 650 acres was let in ? by the Department during the week.

LOANS FOR AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENTS.

Seventy-two applications for loans for agricultural implements were received by the Department during the past week. The total value of Machinery ordered from the beginning of the present year to date, under the Scheme, amounts to Â£21,727.

PROGRESS OF TILLAGE OPERATIONS.

Sewing of grain and potatoes has commenced generally and is well forward in many districts. Instructors&apos; reports indicate that farmers are responding with enthusiasm to the call for ? a further increase of tillage. A striking improvement is noticeable in farmers&apos; methods regarding the use and purchase of manures, the selection of seeds, and the treatment of the restricted areas under meadow and ?.

WHEAT SOWING.

The continued sewing of spring wheat, and the unprecedented demand for seed, leave no margin for doubt that the increase in the area ? this crop will be up to the most sanguine expectations. There is an abundant supply of seed for this and other farm crops.

SHORTAGE OF FODDER.

A shortage of hay and straw has manifested itself in certain counties, as expected. Owing to the mildness of the season and the ? growth of grass it is hoped, however, that this shortage will ? no serious consequences.

SUPPLIES OP FEEDING STUFFS FOR LIVE STOCK,   The  shortage  of maize and  other  feeding stuffs  still  continues/and;  as already  stated, threatens to  affect very adversely the  pro-auction of meat  supplies in Ireland0                        F  LA Xo   Tho  ordinary  time  for sowing  flax  is during April and the beginningof May. Though  the weather is at present very favourable for field  woiip&amp;xsdsXSKKX&apos;  sowing operations have  net yot commenced except in a fewins Lances in tho earliest districts.   Farmers appear to  be  /ery  keen on  sowing flax this season, andthere is every indication that the  supply of seed  will not meet thoirrequirements.  There  is general  anxiety as to the  arrival of DutchSeed, and growers aro not inclined  to purchase either Canadian orJapanese seed freely  so long  as  they  have any hope of getting a fullsupply of Dutch.,    Unfortunately, a  large  proportion of the imported seed of 1915growth (of which there was  s  supply cf about 20,000 bags) and also ofChe home-grown seed7  is now shewing such defective germination that  itoill scarcely be fit  for sowing  purposes0  This will be  a very ccn-slderablo factor in  limiting  tha&quot; area that will be sown.    The first consignment of  new Dutch flaxseod7 amounting to 800bags, arrived in Belfast on the  84th instantr   The following arrivals of  seed aro also reportedSr        Canadian Common Soed?
